Venue,Sentiment,Text
1066 battle of hastings battle,positive,1 disabled toilet near the cafe - this is the only toilet facility I saw.
1st stop 2 shop dundee,positive,"Parking directly outside, lowered kerb with KEEP CLEAR sign.  On bus route. Although not advertised, there is a wheelchair accessible toilet with grab rails available."
200 degrees coffee shop barista school leeds,negative,"Nearest car park is about a quarter of a mile away at least, although it does have plenty of disabled parking bays. It's not a street for road vehicles, so the nearest bus stop is maybe 100 m away."
22 the square cross hills,positive,"Small car park with 1 disabled bay. Parking is tight but there is a council car park opposite with good sized disabled bays Good clean loo, situated in the bar. Red cord was tied up but otherwise very clean, good quality soap and handcream, very stylish."
23 the grill barnoldswick,negative,"Parking available on the street front by 23 The Grill- a couple of which are disabled. If unavailable, there is a short stay car park behind the establishment about 100 yards away with plenty of spaces."
23 the grill barnoldswick,positive,"Accessible toilet very easy to find. Plenty of room for carers/manoeuvring with chairs. Pull down grab rails next to toilet. Tap may be awkward to use due to small button rather than handle. Well lit, clean, and tidy."
3 kenwick woods louth,positive,"Parking outside lodge,  and disabled parking at hotel and spa Toilet in lodge very accessible.  Did not go in hotel or spa."
3 threes coffee lounge birmingham,negative,No accessible toilet available.
30 james street home of the titanic liverpool,negative,There is no parking on the street and the nearest car parking space is a good 10mins away however there is a Taxi Rank outside the front door and the James St Interchange is almost next door this gives access to local train and bus services which are available from early morning and well into the evening    There is one Wheelchair accessible toilet this is on the 7th floor next to the restaurant and bar and is to the left as you go through the set of double doors and is on the left hand side. The door indicates it as a baby change but it is also the accessible toilet no signs to show this  The toilet has rails on both sides and there should be just enough space for a care giver the Red Cord is one off the most tied up red cords I have ever seen and is about the height of the sink.      The Red cord has been removed completely 
360life church stockport,positive,"The church has its own car park with 3 accessible bays right by the door (a lot of spaces as it is a fairly small car park) car park is flat and smooth surface  Close to a bus route - couple of minutes away New, clean accessible toilet. Fairly big and usual rails etc, but not a full changing places toilet.  Red emergency cord.  "
4500 miles from delhi oxford,negative,This really is the smallest accessible toilet I have ever seen. The rear of your wheelchair touched the door and the front touched the toilet so there was absolutelyto manoeuvre and you need is somebody to help pull your wheelchair away so you could get on the toilet. 
50 george square edinburgh,negative,"Not much parking nearby. We parked elsewhere and got the tram. It's an uphill walk to the venue from the tram stop though. There is parking next to the building which is reserved for the university staff, it is unclear if blue badge holders can park there. Blue badge holders can park at part of George square. Several bus stops are nearby. It’s not immediately obvious where the toilet is. More, clearer signs would be good. Clean facilities. Incredibly difficult to park nearby if you need close proximity parking."
50 george square edinburgh,positive,we didn't use or see the toilets to review these. We were visiting the Project Room and the accessible loo is across the corridor. Well signed. Clean and good sized.   Is located beside the other toilets. A good sized modern accessible toilet was available.
56 north edinburgh,negative,"unless it has changed drastically since I was there, the toilets are down a flight of stairs and had no accessible toilets at ground level so it is on my boycott list."
56 north edinburgh,positive,I have always been dropped off to this venue by taxi and am not sure how easy it would be to park. There is off street parking. Flagging a taxi in this area is fairly easy depending on the time of day.
78 derngate northampton,positive,Space for carer.  Large and clean.
8to8 dental buckie,negative,There was a loo but it was difficult to maneuverer in. 
911 memorial museum new york,positive,The memorial is easy to access and the museum is right next door. We were staying nearby so it was only a short distance but there are subway stations nearby that are wheelchair accessible. Several accessible toilets located throughout. Clean & spacious.
a little bit of heaven lostwithiel,positive,We use a wheelchair adapted vehicle. Parking was provided in front of the accommodation with amble space to work around the vehicle and additional space for guest vehicles. The toilet and shower room are combined. The toilet has a hoist over and bars on either side. The toilet is higher than average which made the personal toilet riser we had taken unnecessary.
a therapy for you in leith edinburgh,positive,"A disabled parking bay is located in the car park. An accessible toilet with grab rails, room to turn, and bright and light decor is off the main corridor."
abax stadium peterborough,negative,The concourse in the away end was a very small area so my advice would be not to go at half time when many people queue up for drinks and snacks. You could clearly see the entrance to the disabled toilet and it was a decent size with all the necessary things to assist and it was well maintained also. No problems with the toilet in the oldest stand so a straightforward process really. Just don’t go at half time.
abberton reservoir visitor centre layer de la haye,positive,"3 disabled bays could be a little closer to the centre. 1 disabled toilet/baby change. Very clean, handrail, automatic light, no mirror. 3 disabled bays clearly marked a short walk from the centre. You could also park at the end of the car park nearest to the causeway. There are plenty of spaces and the parking is free. in the centre. Automatic lights, loads of room, very clean. There are clearly marked disabled bays in the car park next to the visitors centre, which is a good starting point for the outing. If it is after 5, when the centre closes, you can easily park on the causeway next to the centre. There is an accessible loo in the centre, easy to negotiate with plenty of room for a carer."
abbey gardens bury saint edmunds,positive,"Nearest parking is available in the Angel Hill car park (free with Blue badge), Ram Meadow (pay but with additional time given) and behind the Premier Inn. There is also some nearby disabled bays (near the police station).    There is a train station in Bury St Edmunds. It is the other side of town, so probably a 30 minute walk. There is a bus station in town approx 15 minute walk. There are public toilets in the gardens - a discrete toilet block at the top of the gardens. Often has an attendant. I think the disabled toilet is RADAR locked.   The abbey also had a reasonable  disabled toilet.   "
abbotsford melrose,negative,"We walked from the train station in Tweedbank, which is a long walk, and it wasn't easy to find. Abbotsford is made for drivers; although, we did't see many parking spaces as there were a few coaches that took plenty of space.  Loos were find, there was a disabled loo."
abbotsford melrose,positive,"Car park the loo was easy to find, lots of space for a mobility scooter and carer, there were grab rails and it was clean. Personally for me its a 20 minute walk from Tweedbank, the last stop on the new Boarders Railway line (roughly a 1h 20m ride from Waverly). Who doesn't love a railway journey and it has opened up the boarders to those without a car. The buses in the area are great, going to Abbotsford House and Melrose town (about a 10 minute bus ride).  See photographs There are disabled parking spaces at the end of the car park nearest to the Visitor Centre and the house. We travelled by train on the new Borders Railway to Tweedbank Station, from where there is a pleasant wheel/walk to Abbotsford, past Gunknowe Loch. Allow 25 minutes for this. If using a wheelchair, book journey assistance with Scotrail in advance - they are very helpful. There are no station staff at Tweebank, but the conductor on the train will deploy a ramp for you. There are well-equipped accessible toilets in the Visitor Centre, both on the ground floor and at restaurant level. Disables Parking available very close to the entrance  Available in visitors centre Getting to Abbotsford was easier than we expected. We arrived by car but it was great to see that Abbotsford have a courtesy minibus service that runs from Tweedbank railway station to the house and back. It is also possible to walk from Tweedbank if the weather is fine and you don't mind a country stroll.   We swept in the gate and the car parking area is set out in clearly marked areas with hedges and good surfaced road. The accessible parking bays were the first we encountered and we parked in a bay closest to the gently sloping path that takes you down to the visitor centre. It was about 100m and fairly easy to get along - bit of a push going back up but with a hand from my accompanist we managed easily. The accessible toilet I used was in the visitor centre on the ground floor. It was clearly signposted, had a wide easy to slide door, plenty of space and was spotlessly clean. Just as things should be!"
abbotsinch pub dining grangemouth,positive,There are three disabled places opposite the entrance.  They are not angled to the wall and you might have a problem with a WAV with a ramp. Well signposted.  You can get a wheelchair inside without any problem.  Fully fitted with grabrails.
aberdeen douglas hotel aberdeen,positive,"handy for city centre, car parking for guests available locally."
aberdeen maritime museum aberdeen,negative,"The availability for parking is not the best. There aren't parking spaces around the building. Disabled parking spaces are available outside The Robert Gordon University, which is located next to Aberdeen Art Gallery. "
aberdeen maritime museum aberdeen,positive,"Easy to find, clean and tidy. There are accessible loos on the ground (cafe) and second levels. Doors quite heavy. Side transfer just possible from one side in both cases. Both well equipped with grab rails and all facilities sensibly positioned. No sign of an alarm cord in either accessible loo. There are two accessible loos, one of them downstairs and the other one in the second floor of the museum, both of them are easy to access through the lift and easy to find due to the clear signs. The loos are big enough and very clean and tidy."
aberdeen railway station aberdeen,positive,"The station is fairly close to the City centre. There are plenty of buses around the station. You are also quite close to the harbour area if you're planning on venturing further afield on the ferries. Taxis drop of right inside the station adjacent to the main concourse. If you're heading toward Union Street it is an uphill route but you can utilise the route through the Trinity Centre from Guild Street. Just off the main thoroughfare of the concourse there are toilets. Immediately before the payment barrier is an accessible toilet. It has a RADAR lock, with a wide and easy to use door. Once inside there was plenty of space to manoeuvre my powerchair. It was clean and well kept."
aberdeen sports village aquatics centre aberdeen,positive,"The accessible parking is brilliant, as you enter the car park on the left and the right is two full rows of clearly marked spaces. The are right next to the front door.  There are many buses in Aberdeen that travel up and down King Street, there is a bus stop right  at the main gate which leads on to a smooth path that leads you right to the main door.  Overall the Aquatics Centre is very accessible. There are several accessible toilets: one in the cafe area is always clean, it has plenty grab rails to allow a safe transfer. It is however a little tight for space is there was more than a manual wheelchair and a carer: anyone that needs more space for assistance I would recommend the pool toilets past reception. In the pool toilets the are various alarm cords, fixed and mobile grab rails- also there is a commode an a hoist system attached to the ceilin. Should always get a parking space and entrance just beside. Busy cafe toilets, but toilets on all levels."
abergavenny market abergavenny,positive,There is adequate disabled parking spaces in the Council car parks which are withing easy distance of the market.  All routes to the market have dropped kerbs.
aberystwyth railway station aberystwyth,negative,"the train itself is not a friendly one, many time the call for assistance button is faulty and goes of by itself so is often unanswered, as well as the disabled loo doors often needing a swift kick to close. the disabled parking for the station is close to the ramp access. as with all train station toilets, its best to give them a miss. yr hen orsaf weather-spoons is right at the end of the platform and have a very nice disabled loo next to the bar. go there instead."
ability fest glasgow,positive,Two accessible toilets available of differing layouts and sizes.
abingdon street market blackpool,negative,The market is in a pedestrian area and as a result there is no parking near to this venue. The Blackpool tram system nearest stop would be Tower or North Pier this is a good 10mins walk away
absolute dogs dundee,positive,"There are a few parking spaces designated to Absolute Dogs right outside the shop. They aren’t sign posted as accessible parking however, they aren’t marked with any lines at all. Whenever I have visited there has always been plenty of room beside my car. One of the parking spaces is right outside the entrance to Absolute Dogs which could be difficult however, there has always been space between cars and the entrance when I’ve visited.  Due to being located in the city centre of Dundee there are bus stops coming from all over Dundee, I’m not sure what ones or where these are. "
academy plaza hotel dublin,negative,I came on wheelchair but left for the airport in a taxi which can park right outside. A short 5 min stroll will take you into the city centre straight onto O’Connell St which has bus stops and the Luas tram system. I only used my room toilet which was basic but fine for my needs - grab rail on right hand side and space to transfer. However I did see an accessible toilet near the breakfast area past reception. There was no key or swipe card needed to enter. 
academy plaza hotel dublin 1,negative,Lock in ground floor toilet was broken but reception said it will be fixed. There are also larger accessible toilets in each accessible room. These have numerous wall bars and are large enough for an assistant/carer and also to manouvre your scooter/wheelchair around.
academy plaza hotel dublin 1,positive,I got a bus (has accessible space for 1 scooter) from the airport. This stops nearby. 
acces plus train service courbevoie,negative,"Public parking is difficult in Paris, I would recommend using a cab, unless you know someone who knows the city well."
acces plus train service courbevoie,positive,"With a manual wheelchair, I can reach the toilet myself, and transfer on my own thanks to he handles. I always bring my own hand sanitizer."
access travel scotland cleland,positive,"It's a transport service, that's what I have already reviewed. William parked right outside the venue for our pick up and was able to drop us off in the centre of Largs."
accessible boating hook,positive,We parked our car for free of charge for the week in the marina car park which was locked every night.  Disabled Portaloo on board and also a normal toilet.
accessible boating odiham,negative,There is a small toilet in the main area. I knew I wouldn’t be able to use it as the only support rails are fixed (so you can’t side transfer). They are removable but then you have no support rails. I’d say an independent wheelchair user could get to the side of the toilet to transfer if rails were not needed and someone closed the door behind you. The toilet would also have been too high for lifting me on to ( and there is no space for a carer inside at the same time. We resolved is by bringing my shower/toilet seat commode. We put blankets up over a few windows and transferred in the main boat area before pushing me backwards into the toilet room. The door did then close. You could bring a number of sheets (about 8-10) to cover all windows and use a portable hoist over a commode in the main area. Luckily the way we went was fairly quiet to do this with a level of privacy. The toilet will suit some people more than others - but with private hire what we did was not so bad! We came prepared!
accessible boating odiham,positive,There was general parking a short walk from the boat and you can drop off right next to it to unload/load. 
accessible madrid madrid,positive,Accessible Madrid delivered my rented scooter to our hotel and gave useful advice on how to use buses and metro trains. 
according to mcgee york,positive,Just across the road is Clifford Tower car park with blue badge spaces. If there is no room in the car park there is almost always parking on the double yellows on Castlegate. A number of bus stops close by
ace london,negative,"Lots of buses serve the area, but the nearest tube station, Clapham Common, is crassly inaccessible, reachable only via steep flights of stairs. "
acharacle tea room acharacle,negative,"Again, space is limited - and you have to go through a door to reach the toilets. The ladies toilet doubles up as the accessible loo, and while it's not perfect it is a good facility. Watch out for the table with the toiletries place on it as you enter - it would be so much better if this wasn't here. There is also no emergency red cord either, so be aware of this."
achilleion corfu,positive,"I visited as part of a private taxi tour so I was dropped off at the entrance gates and collected from their too. I don't know about public transport but I think there is a hop on hop off sightseeing busy that stops here. I didn't use the accessible toilet while I was there, as it is mentioned on their website plus someone did a TA review in July 2017 confirming this."
acorn house veterinary surgery bedford,positive,disabled parking close to building entrance All fine and easy to use. Perhaps the loo itself could be a bit higher.
ada meze kitchen newport,negative,"I managed to get into the disabled toilet but it was a bit tricky. There was not a lot of room to turn round in front of the door to go in straight. And inside the toilet, the space was only just big enough for my powerchair.  It could have been better but it could also have been worse."
ada meze kitchen newport,positive,There is a pay-and-display car park Just across the road where blue badge holders can park for free. There is also a disabled toilet in this car park.
adam reid at the french manchester,positive,There is one spacious toilet that is unisex.  Plenty of turning room.  Lovely cloth hand wipe/towels
adam smith theatre kirkcaldy,negative,Some parking available to the rear of the building. Or some nearby on street parking.
adam smith theatre kirkcaldy,positive,"Toilets very accessible. Clean. Nearest bus stop is the home of kirkcaldy buses, just a few metres away from the theatre. (5 minute walk) space for carer, clean and tidy (lovely soaps) lots of room easy to find Adam Smith is about 400 yards from main bus station. There is limited parking and just two blue badge spaces so get there early or you will need to park in surrounding streets.  Wide door and good circulation space. Entry, exit and lock is via a light touch  button on the wall.  Side transfer should be from right to left but large nappy bin in the way. I asked for it to be moved. We will see what happens. Another reason why baby changing should NOT be in accessible toilets.  great transport links close to bus and train station small car park at the side of the theatre with disabled spaces easy to get in and out of lots of room  could do with a bigger sign"
adams diner clydebank,negative,On Dumbarton road so plenty buses will pass I assume.  We went by car there is only one disabled bay however as its at the end plenty room.
adams diner clydebank,positive,Not signposted but obvious where it is Large area that I think would fit a mobility scooter Toilet raised I'd say  Plenty rails.
adamton country house hotel prestwick,negative,No specific disabled parking spaces Accessible toilet available just off reception 
adelphi theatre london,negative,"It wasn't that easy to find somewhere nearby for a car to drop me off and set up my folding scooter, but that's not the theatre's fault - it's just how it is in central London. There are plenty of bus stops nearby, and London buses do all have ramps, so that's how I got home (very slow but otherwise fine)."
adelphi theatre london,positive,"Bus and taxi options. I came by scooter on the pavement.  The Adelphi is located just 15 minutes wheel from Waterloo station. Spacious and very clean. See photo. Spacious, clean and looked like it has recently been redecorated. The staff all knew about it and noticed that I needed a bit of a hand with the door."
adolfo suarez madrid barajas airport madrid,negative,Taxis good when you get to a terminal that has them - T4S no taxis. Not sure as didn't have to use but as no evening lift access may be a problem. 
advantage   edinburghs disability tennis programme edinburgh,positive,"There are 4-5 blue badge parking bays located close to the entrance with easy access to the building Ample disability parking available at venue. Clean and functional, available on court level and also cafe level."
advocating together dundee,positive,"I got the bus here There is only one oilet which is wheelchair accessible Usually okay depending on road works and parking spaces There was plenty room to manoeuvre if required. I got a lift by car, but will start bus shortly It's perfect. I got the bus and they came quite frequently and stop a couple of minuts away. Parking is not good. Easy to find, sign posted, on the ground floor and wheelchair accessible"
affinity sterling mills outlet shopping tillicoultry,positive,Huge carpark with many disabled parking spaces close to the shops. Bus stops close by to connect to Stirling and Alloa.  A large cubicle within the men's and womens. Red cord to the floor and all handles as expected. 
africa alive kessingland,positive,Plenty of parking - several disabled spaces.  As expected. 
agriturismo le ragnaie montalcino,negative,"I can only comment on Room #1. The bathroom is accessible on the flat. It is large and comfortable, but there were no rails or handles. There was a bidet next to the loo which might cause problems if you needed to transfer, but for someone walking with sticks it was accessible."
agriturismo le ragnaie montalcino,positive,"Large and very flat hotel car park. Shallow gravel, which caused the electric wheelchair no problems. You would have you drive up a slope which goes into the car park from the hotel to reach the rooms/reception/restaurant without using stairs. However, there is space for this."
ainslie park leisure centre edinburgh,negative,"Very good - large car park (with disabled spaces).  Good too for public transport although as the venue is not on the    main road, a walk would be incurred. Again, perfectly adequate but difficult to find."
ainslie park leisure centre edinburgh,positive,"There were wheelchair spaces available directly outside the centre. You are required to go to the front of the building to get level access though via a dropped kerb as there is a kerb in front of most of the spaces.  The downstairs accessible loo was spacious,  had an adult sized changing loo and also had 2 different heights for coat hangers. I like the coat hanger feature as it shows they have made a real effort to think through the real needs of wheelchair users or those of short stature. Limited amount of accessible spaces considering the size of the Car park. Spaces directly at the front door. There is a good bus service that passes 2 min walk from the entrance. Good sized accessible toilets. We can always get one of the accessible parking spots right out side the door. However on rainy days puddles do appear that you have to climb over in order the keep your feet dry. There is a loo in the disabled changing area which is very spacious and has grab bars in the right places"
airth castle hotel stirlingshire,negative,"I drove, there was 2 car parks but no disabled spaces to be seen. My partner injured herself on the steps leading up from the lower car park as the slab was loose. "
airth castle hotel stirlingshire,positive,I would think you would need a car to get there. There is a large carpark which has a couple of disabled spaces at the entrance to the spa. 
aiyana beauty salon shetland,positive,"There are two accessible parking bays immediately outside the door of the farm shop.  There is a small toilet in the salon, but there is also a fully accessible toilet available in the building for customers to use. The toilet had everything I needed as a manual wheelchair user."
ajs diner crossgar,negative,"There is only very limited on street parking.  No actual car park. Although it is situated on the corner of the main street in Crossgar, the bus service that passes is not very regular."
ajs diner crossgar,positive,"Plenty of space, & very clean"
akita senshu museum of art akita,positive,The gallery is a 15 minute walk from the main station. There are bus services to stops nearby but I did not use them. As pictured. Clean and well-maintained with a button operated sliding door and plenty of grab rails.
akita station akita,positive,"There are taxi companies in the city that can take wheelchairs, but you will need to call to have one pick you up from the station.  Tran accessibility in Japan is variable. Manual ramps can be used on newer trains and the bullet train, but older rolling stock on lines like the Gono line only has stepped access.   It is strongly recommended to book a wheelchair space if you are looking to travel by bullet train."
aksos suites accessible suites chania,positive,Flat parking area next to apartments
alba highland cottages boat of garten,positive,"Parking right outside the garden gate enough for three  cars The loo is in along with the wet floor shower room, every thing was there all the grab rails that one would need, plenty of turning room in the wet room, the sink was a right level and so was the mirror on the wall"
albatross cars derby,positive,They are a door to door taxi service. They have two different kinds of wheelchair accessible vans according to website.   If your wheelchair is tall you may need to remove headrest.  Leave plenty of time so that you can be strapped into the space. 
albemarle music centre hull,negative,The toilet had all the necessary hand rails and low level mirror. There was plenty of room for a carer and was clean and tidy.   However the red cord was tucked behind a pipe and had been cut short by approximately one metre.   So I untucked it to let it hang freely and attached a Euan's Guide Card. 
albemarle music centre hull,positive,Large public multi storey car park adjacent to the venue. 
albert dock liverpool,positive,"rating for parking as do not want to review ourselves. Coach parking drop of and collect points at Albert docks, very convenient for passengers and our coach has access lift, Large floor level toilet that expands for Wheelchair room also seats with extra leg room and wheelchair spaces to be firmly secured in place, on board games to encourage socialising in large print. Plenty of parking and disabled spaces but blue badge holders still need to pay. There are toilets within different facilities, and a changing places toilet within the Tate gallery."
albert hall manchester,positive,"The accessible toilet was also great and much better than I expected for a listed building. It was larger with a good amount of space to move around. It had the standard accessible features - grab rails, emergency cord and it was RADAR locked. There were also personal touches including toiletries like deodorant, hand cream and female sanitary products placed inside a box. I took half a star off because the toilet is located on the other side of the accessible area, which can't be helped because of how old the building etc. I could park very close to hall They use the radar key scheme "
alder hey childrens charity liverpool,positive,"Multi storey car park. Great provision in theory but there is a lot of demand for spaces. Good lifts but would recommend dropping off short distance walkers close to lift before parking if busy. £2 fee but there is also a cafe,  restaurateur, fruit and veg stall. You might be able to park in drop off for free if someone stays with car. Perfect for our needs."
aldi derby,positive,There are disabled bays outside the store they are wide but they don't have very clear markings.  Several buses run near the store and there are pedestrian crossings. 
aldi edinburgh,positive,Gorgie has good transport links and there is also a large parking area. It is also next to Gorgie McDonalds.
aldi greenock,positive,This Aldi is not far from Greenock town and quite easy to get to by car. There is plenty of disabled parking spaces available.
aldi wishaw,positive,The car park is quite tight to manoeuvre but there are about 10 blue badge bays outside. There are also more space down a small decline at the B&M Bargains and McDonalds area.
aldwych theatre london,positive,We travelled by train from Sevenoaks to Charing Cross.  I had booked disabled assistance but we were early both going to London and coming back.  We were met both ends by helpful station staff who were waiting with ramps.  There was plenty of space in the designated disabled seating area and the accessible loo was nearby.  
alexander thomson hotel glasgow,negative,There in no disabled parking available bus rail and taxi close at hand given Glasgow Central rail station.
alford community campus alford,positive,There is a bus that goes right to the door and lots of disabled parking close to the entrance. Several loos located around the campus. All well signposted. Disabled spaces available Emergency buttons. Wide. Plenty of space. Railing and bars
alhambra granada,negative,There were three toilets that I passed by and I only visited the one near Nasrid Palace. It was small. Enough room for my scooter but barely enough for a second person. It had a grab rail. It was clean and tidy. No help cord or button. See photos. You might need to find someone for the key. A bunch of keys were already in the door when I arrived. There was no area for changing of any kind.
alhambra granada,positive,"We took a taxi from the rank at Plaza Nueva in the centre of Granada. It cost €5,50. Avoid ride share apps because the taxis can cost closer to €20 as they can’t use the network of taxi and bus only roads. The driver helped get the scooter into the boot.  We’ve taken the bus number C32 on a previous visit. They are accessible with a ramp and they have a wheelchair area. It costs about €1,50 per trip. Both drop you off at the entrance to the Alhambra.   The Bus and taxi drop off zone is cobbled on a slope with some smooth pathways a few metres away.  There’s lots of parking with disabled bays, although it’s expensive and on a slope. There are smooth routes to the entrance."
alhambra theatre bradford,negative,"There are accessible toilet's avaliable at the venue, these are unisex and do not require a key to open. The door is locked on a locking handle and the taps are a lever type. The toilets have a emergency alarm. Lighting levels in the toilets are bright. The mirrors in the toilet are at a low level promoting easy use. "
alhambra theatre bradford,positive,"The venue does not have its own car park, but does have a blue badge holders car park next to the theatre for ease of access. "
alhambra theatre dunfermline,positive,"Didn't use parking although there are 2 car parks close by. Access at main entrance for taxis although not when performance finishes Large disabled toilet, easily enough room for a wheelchair and carer. Toilet just outside auditorium on ground floor."
alice holt forest bucks horn oak,positive,"Good parking with designated Blue Badge spaces but no free parking.  Disabled toilet provided meeting Changing Places criteria. Access by RADAR key, available from staff. "
all aboard watersports bristol,positive,There are 2 disable parking spaces beside the centre and the bus route drops you on the main road beside it. soon the metro bus will come along this road. There is no overhead hoist though they have a mobile hoist upstairs. Contrast toilet seat and sink for visually impaired customers. Hand rail and reasonable room
all bar one edinburgh,negative,"If you are a blue badge holder cool, otherwise the street."
all bar one liverpool,positive,"Taxi rank and James Street railway station and Bus stop 2 mins away. Q Car Park 5 mins walk. Easy to find a bit on the small side, very clean with nice toiletries and powerful hand dryer"
all bar one london,negative,"I couldn't find any signage to the accessible toilet, I had to ask staff where it was.   The toilet has the usual fold-down grab-rail but it was partly detached from the wall: dangerous and negligent. See my pictures below. I was shocked by this. Two stars lost for this.  The red emergency cord is MUCH too short. It stops a good metre short of the floor. See my picture below. It should reach all the way to the floor, so that it can be pulled by anyone who falls over in the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back. Two stars lost for this.   "
all bar one london,positive,"North Greenwich Station is fully step-free and just a few hundred metres away. Many buses serve the adjacent bus station. You can also catch riverboats to and from nearby North Greenwich Pier. All riverboats are wheelchair accessible, but mobility scooters must first register with TfL and obtain a Mobility Access Card (free of charge) which is a certificate that their particular mobility scooter is valid for use on riverboats - not all mobility scooters are permitted on riverboats."
all bar one oxford,positive,"No parking at the venue, but there are disabled bays in town and you can park in residents' only bays in Oxford. Try St Giles or get a bus to central Oxford. Good and large with handrails but the radar lock had been broken for some time when I last went in, so anyone with a key can get in."
allan bank and grasmere ambleside,positive,"There is one official disabled parking place up at the house. You drive up a private lane/drive to the property. At the top of the drive there is a gate, depending on when you visit, you might have to get out, open it, drive through and get out again to close it. "
allanwater brewhouse bridge of allan,negative,"Car park currently restricted because of building work in adjacent building. Local road parking can be difficult during day times. Bridge of Allan has good links by road and rail. Railway station about half mile away. Bus stops within 100 yards. Currently the hotel next to the pub is being worked on so there isn't any parking next to it.  We parked in a local car park a couple of minutes walk away.    I'm not sure how good public transport is to Bridge of Allan. Not the best accessible loo, but at least there is one.  It's nice and tall and has handrails (thought they were wobbly), not sure you would fit a large electric wheelchair in it."
allanwater brewhouse bridge of allan,positive,Same care required through microbrewery. Plenty of room and good hand rails inside.
allestree park golf club derby,negative,"Parking is free for all. The carpark is very uneven with no designated parking bays. We went by car but could be accessed by public transport, which would take you to the A6 with a walk up the driveway. The driveway is tarmacked and has speed bumps along the route. No pathway and in places only wide enough for one car to pass. There are accessible facilities in the main building, however on the day I visited, I could not access them as the ramp was blocked with cleaning equipment, and nobody was available to move it."
alligator alley summerdale,positive,Plenty of parking with blue badge spaces close to the ticket office No public transport.  Fine but no emergency string. It seems these are uncommon in USA. 
alloa leisure bowl alloa,positive,"Plenty spaces, but a bit cramped."
alltnacriche carrbridge,positive,"Parking at rear of property right at door, wheelchair accessible  Completely accessible wetroom With large bath shower , shower chair and hoist There's a fully accessible bathroom adjoining the accessible bedroom (there are several rooms, one of which is kitted out as accessible). It has a shower with a custom wheelchair for washing, and a hoist which takes someone directly from sitting in bed over to the jacuzzi bath. The only criticism is that there could be more grab rails."
almond valley livingston,positive,There were plenty of disabled parking spaces right next to the entrance which made parking very easy and straight forward. I noticed there there was a bus stop at the top of the road so not far at all. We used two disabled toilets and they were very spacious and easy to access. Disabled spaces right outside the front door.  Only one on the site plus one in the cafe. Red cords were tied up. One too long. One too short. Unfortunately I didn't have cord cards to attach. Photos below.
almondvale stadium livingston,positive,"ARRIVING AT THE STADIUM From the A899 to the Stadium is well signposted, with a direction sign at every junction.    CAR PARKING Dedicated Car park beside the Stadium.  No charge for Blue Badge TOILETS and REFRESHMENTS Good access"
alnwick castle alnwick,positive,"We arrived by motorhome, following directions from Google Maps. Don't! Google hasn't got a clue where the parking is, though she may have been taking us to the limited accessible parking at the top of the castle in town.  We aimed towards coach drop off and accessible parking and a helpful member of staff showed us where to park. The walk back up towards the castle was lovely, though mostly uphill and cobbled in places.   Signage was distinctly lacking! We got a bit lost and nearly went into the gardens instead of the castle but staff helped redirect us. One of the accessible loos, on the route up to the castle, was out of order. The ones in the courtyard were open and were clean and easy to access.  In the main entrance there is a disbaled toliet and another one located in the cafe shop and courtyard cafe. And additional toliets are available in the Pavilion at the Alnwick Gardens. No problems getting there, disabled spaces close to the entrance and the surface for wheeling ok, though up a gentle slope. No problem, my wheelchair fitted in perfectly and there were suitable grab rails. The staff in the normal car park directed us to a disabled parking car park. Staff in the disabled parking area were very infomative & explained I could swap my manual wheelchair for a electric scooter to get around. My husband was very grateful ! Clean. Accessible."
alnwick youth hostel alnwick,positive,"The hostel doesn't have its own parking, but we had no trouble finding blue badge street parking nearby. It was the best thing about the room!"
alston bar beef glasgow,negative,"Need to go back up in lift to toilet, tight turning space to enter. Big enough for a carer and clean."
alston bar beef glasgow,positive,In glasgow central station so easy access to trains and easy access from NCP car park attached to station
alta alta,positive,We arrived by cruise ship then shuttle bus into town. Lowered pavements and very accessible. All shops in two indoor markets with adjacent multi storey car park.  Toilets in the malls were of generous proportions with all required rails. Loos in Norway tend not to have emergency cords. 
alternative wolf and bear park black forest freudenstadt,negative,"There was an accessible loo by the shop and there appeared to be another block of loos being built at the other end of the park with a disabled toilet.  The one by the shop was ramped but it had a small lip at the top and the bottom of the ramp of a couple of centimetres.  There was a grab bar by the toilet and the toilet roll was on a stand that could be moved.  Unfortunately the toilet was too high to get onto it easily from a wheelchair, the sink was too high to use comfortably and the mirror was also too high.  There was a suitable bin and the room was very clean."
am politician isle of south uist,positive,"Large car park not sure if there was designated disabled parking but wasn’t a problem  Accessible toilet, well signposted, grab rails available. Plenty of room & clean. "
amani house airbnb leeds,negative,Small bathroom and not accessible
amani house airbnb leeds,positive,"There is a space opposite the house, as well as lots of on-street parking. Easy to get here by public transport as just off the main road, so easy bus access and not far from town for taxi rides. "
amazona zoo cromer,positive,Good sized car park with disabled spaces near zoo entrance. Not tarmac so can get a bit muddy with puddles but was no problem for my mobility scooter.  Large ramp to entrance.
amber arts edinburgh,positive,On street parking available nearby. A number of bus stops nearby.
amber restaurant at the scotch whisky experience edinburgh,negative,"Parking isn’t great as it is on the approach to the Castle. That said, there are a couple of accessible parking bays at the top of Johnston Terrace - that around 150metres. There are tour buses of many colours that pass through the nearby Lawn Market and these have great wheelchair access - even space for two chairs which was impressive. It is a little difficult to get parked close to the restaurant as it is on the Royal Mile, but I managed to get parked on Johnston Terrace. There are 2 disabled bays here, which are very handy."
amber restaurant at the scotch whisky experience edinburgh,positive,"There's a good accessible toilet in the lobby area adjacent to the restaurant.  The accessible loo is on the same floor as the restaurant. It may not be the most spacious but was fine for us. Very clean and tidy. Good lighting. There is ample parking in the streets surrounding the Royal Mile, I parked on Chambers Street next to the Museum. If you have difficulty walking, the street would not be ideal, but as I am in my power chair, I was able to zip up the road. The disabled toilet is very practical. It has been made a little small by very large sink but it is still a good space for a wheelchair user. We parked in Chamber Street as we couldn't think of any other blue badge spaces nearby. This is an easy 10 minute walk/roll from the venue. Of the whole experience this was the only part we had any issues with. The sink in the accessible toilet is far too large for the space. It made it difficult for my wife to manoeuvre her chair she needs to be able to face onto the toilet to empty and we struggled with the space for this. I'm not sure how easy it would be to transfer from a chair to the toilet as there didn't appear to be enough space to park the chair up next to it. The loo was very easy for me to find and had all that I needed, with handrails etc. It was very clean and modern inside, and had obviously had some investment. It would be useful if it was a little bigger though."
ambiente tapas york,negative,"I parked 5 minutes away in Monk Bar car park which boasts 40 disabled bays. There is a cobbled surface outside the restaurant. Grab rails, emergency cord, clean and tidy, room to access BUT combined with a baby change - one of my bug-bears!"
ambiente tapas york,positive,"We didn't use the car. Walking / riding there was fine, if a little bumpy! Plenty of space but wish it wasn't also the baby changing area."
american candy store paisley,positive,Parking is available on first level of car park available in main part of shopping centre
american express community stadium brighton,positive,Parking availabile to book right outside the stadium  Very spacious 
amigo24 salou,positive,"They come to you - wherever suits you best, we arranged to meet at the hotel lobby where we were staying."
amore express renfrew,positive,There a disabled toilet helpful if needed
amore ristorante e pizzeria glasgow,negative,"The toilet is small and doesn’t seem to have a red cord anywhere. The door into it is a sliding door, but it’s heavy. It also doubles up as baby changing and (I think) a staff locker area. The toilet corridor is accessible via turning a very sharp corner which I imagine would be almost impossible for a wheelchair user."
amore ristorante e pizzeria glasgow,positive,Easily accessible via numerous nearby bus stops on Argyle Street and it’s a very short walk from High Street station. There’s also a drop off point right outside. 
amrath grand hotel frans hals haarlem,positive,Our ensuite bathroom and loo were spacious. A shower chair is provided and there is a wheelchair accessible wetroom shower. The accompanist enjoyed the man-sized bath tub. The loo is equipped with a grab rail. Side transfer from one side is possible. The washbasin is approachable in a wheelchair.
amrath hotel alkmaar alkmaar,negative,"There’s no accessible loo in the foyer area. Our ensuite bathroom was well-equipped in terms of the loo & its grab rails and an approachable washbasin, but we discovered that there was no seat in the shower. The staff were baffled, very apologetic & very helpful and we were swiftly moved to a different accessible room, where the bathroom did have a shower seat, but there were no grab rails anywhere near it. We coped because we travel with an Etac patient turner. Otherwise it would have been impossible for wheelchair girl to transfer to the shower seat."
amrath hotel alkmaar alkmaar,positive,We didn’t use it but the hotel has spacious courtyard parking with level access straight from the car park to the foyer. There’s a bus stop just outside the main entrance and the train station is about 10 minutes wheel/walk away.
amsterdam museum amsterdam,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. The museum is about 15 minutes' wheel/ walk from Amsterdam Centraal Station (mainline rail, underground and tram hub) and about five minutes' wheel/walk from the Dam - the big square in the centre of the city. There is a team stop quite close to the museum but we did not use it, so can't comment. Not all Amsterdam trams are wheelchair accessible. Cobbles, tram lines, the absence of drop downs, inconsiderately parked bikes and vehicles mean that Amsterdam isn't the most wheelchair-friendly city but we encountered no insupetable obstacles as we wheeled/walked. Situated on the basement and on the top level. We only used the basement one. It was well-equipped with grab rails round the loo (side transfer possible from one side - right as you face the loo - only) a wheelchair-accessible washbasin, reasonable space to manoeuvre and one of those excellent alarm cords which are strung right round the room (apart from the doorway) about 18"" above ground level. It would be within reach wherever in the room someone might fall. Hope they catch on on the UK."
an lanntair stornoway,positive,"Parked in a disabled bay near the venue & it was flat all the way there. Accessible toilet immediately beside the lift as you cam into the cafe area. Plenty of room to manoeuvre, adequate grab rails & emergency pull cord."
ananda restaurant dublin,positive,"Disabled parking in centre, 5 minute walk from Ballaly Luas stop Great accessible bathroom with rails etc. Small issue was there's a ramp up to the door which makes it hard to pull it open at an angle (see picture)"
andiamo glasgow,positive,"Fenwick Road has a great 38 bus route, they are every 5/10 minutes. It's also on the Ayr bus route. There is not a lot of on street parking but Giffnock train station is just around the corner, it has a large car park.  The toilet was very spacious. Clean and tidy. "
andrew carnegie birthplace museum dunfermline,positive,"Arriving at the Birthplace Museum we found the large car park and the accessible parking bays - they could do with some more obvious signage- it was also a short walk down the hill from the Abbey Church and the Carnegie Library. The accessible toilet, and toilets, are located  in a separate part of the building. You go out to the garden area and a short path takes you to the entrance door to the building. A large hallway leads to the accessible loo. With a wide door and lots of space it was very good. Also spotlessly clean and had everything you needed. Parking in carpark next to the museum. Transport, Dunfermline Station. Okay"
anfa royale hotel lipa,negative,"Parking is on the street, and the parking strip is ramped, usually no spaces available on this busy road. Toilets in the rooms are ok, but access is normally via a narrow door, and the door faces a wall which can cause narrowness problems."
anfield stadium liverpool,positive,"Parking for Blue Badge holders is a 3 minute walk from the Stadium Private disabled toiled facilities are large, clean and totally accessable Parking is available at the ground and in the street's around the ground there is also a Taxi rank and a local tour bus that runs from Albert Dock Area to the ground at the gates to the stadium .  A number of local buses also stop at the stadium or near to the stadium its self   There are a number of wheelchair toilets through out the tour route these open with a radar key all had rails on both sides and room for a care giver. The club also have a Changing Places Facility while this is not directly on the route of the tour it is not far away should it be required staff can assist you in finding this should you require it There is a Taxi Rank at the gates and a Taxi fare from the Albert Docks area to the ground is around £7.00. There is some parking available in the Streets around the ground on non match days  However on match days there are restrictions on both the Taxi rank and on street parking so many hours before kick off. The club website gives details on this and is something that changes due to games being rescheduled for television etc. There is also a special bus that runs from the city centre Albert Docks area to the ground and again you will find details on this on the club web site. Did not actually see the bus which is a double decker to know if wheelchairs can access the lower deck. There is one accessible toilet is located near to the lift area and was of reasonable size had good lighting and was also very clean as well"
angel of the north gateshead,negative,At least there was one.
angels hotel   bar and restaurant uddingston,negative,Access from car park to bar or restaurant not easy.
angels torquay,positive,Babbacombe is near Torquay. The nearest railway station is Torquay. There are buses that stop nearby. There is a car park which is about 5 - 8 minutes walk away.
anglesey model village llanfairpwllgwyngyll,positive,There are 3 dedicated disabled bays at the entrance. Accessible toilet is good. Again some gravel around but we managed fine. 
annabelle paphos,positive,There was three disabled parking bays just along from the door with flat access The accessible toilet we fould on the 'lobby area'  was very good.  There was also another on the level of the indoor pool.
annandale water services johnstonebridge,negative,Parked close to the door but the flow of traffic came past the ramp on our disabled access vehicle we had to be really careful getting my wife and her chair in and out of the car. Car park could have a safer design. Only 1 disabled toilet on site which was just big enough to get the chair in to it. The toilet was not the cleanest which as it is the only one is understandable. The worst thing was the previous occupant was a young lady in her twenties who strode out after keeping my wife waiting 5 minutes. A lot of able bodied people think they have this right. I used the gents toilet which must have 20 urinals and cubicals and was much cleaner than the 1 small disabled toilet.
annandale water services johnstonebridge,positive,"The Changing place toilet was near the entrance and spacious , well equipped with grab rails. As previously described this is one of the best disab!we toilets"
anyone can fell foot country park windermere,positive,"Disabled parking bays right near the facilities but if these were full it is quite a trek to the next car park. Having said that, I'm pretty sure the company owners would sort you out somehow. I wouldn't personally attempt this by public transport!  Spacious and excellent. Plenty of room for me and the twins together in the changing places. "
apartment barbarossastrae berlin,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Metrobus M46 (every 10 minutes, 24/7) connects to the nearest wheelchair-accessible U-bahn station (Wittenbergplatz) and Zoologischer Garten train station. Berlin buses have wheelchair spaces and a manual ramp can be deployed by the driver if needed. The bus stop is 4 minutes level walk/wheel away. Wittenbergplatz is 15 minutes level wheel/walk away, and KaDeWe, Berlin's uber-Harrods is there. Excellent. Wheel in wet-room shower with seat and grab rails, toilet with grab rails either side, wash basin at wheelchair height and non-slip tiles on the floor. There is a second, non wheelchair accessible toilet off the bathroom."
apartrooms aberdeen,positive,"Went by car. Just off the main A road from Dundee/ south. Didn’t use the bus but there was a bus stop opposite to go into Aberdeen - about 5 miles away. Toilet within wet room. 2 handrails for toilet,  right transfer. Rails by sink, within shower and at door. Fold down seat within shower area."
apex city of edinburgh hotel edinburgh,negative,"Grassmarket is an awkward place to get to by bus but there is some parking nearby.  No Changing Places nearby. The toilets are to the right of the bar through a slightly heavy door and along a narrow corridor. I had to drive down and reverse as I could not turn in my powerchair. The toilet was spacious enough for myself and one other person to assist but again I could not turn the chair completely. The red cord was to the floor and the facilities were clean which is great. The accessible toilet for public use is located next to the bar and a few steps from the entrance to the restaurant and breakfast area.  It is bright and modern with good lighting. A wide door opens outward to provide good access. The toilet has an access space on the left hand side (as you look at it). Unfortunately, the bins are utilising this space and making practical use limited for wheelchair access.  There is a baby changing unit housed in the same facility."
apex city of edinburgh hotel edinburgh,positive,"As a visually impaired person it was important for me to be able to use public transport. There is a small car park where there is an accessible parking space available.  For me, having the taxi rank outside the front door was a great plus. I noticed that many of the city’s tour buses also pass by the door. They were good as they have audio commentaries and the drivers are very helpful if you don’t know where to get off if you’re unfamiliar with places. The Hotel has a small car parking area for four vehicles. There is a single dedicated accessible parking bay. The bay has clear markings and provision has been made for sufficient space for a wheelchair user to be able to move alongside their vehicle to transfer. The parking space should be booked at the time of making the room reservation.  For those using public transport the street side options, only a few metres from the hotel’s front door, offer buses, tour buses and taxis or slightly further afield the tram network and of course the railway stations at Edinburgh Waverly and Haymarket."
apex city quay hotel spa dundee,positive,"Disabled parking bays closest to the doors at carpark side, space at the front door to be dropped off/picked up There are accessible toilets in the spa/main reception and restaurant Other than the loos in our room, I did not use the others in the hotel. Whilst the one in the room had a drop down rail, I found that it was very close to the wall and sink, which made access difficult.  I could not reach the loo roll holder and just used the spare roll because of this."
apex grassmarket hotel edinburgh,positive,"It was easy to get a taxi to the hotel and there are plenty of taxis in the rank opposite the main entrance. The tour buses also come along the street and these are recognisable by their bright colours. You can get a ticket that lasts all day and you hop on and off as you want. You can get a day ticket for the local Lothian Buses as another means of getting around; these cover the trams as well. The Hotel has the benefit of its own on site car park. There is some on street parking directly outside the hotel but it can be busy during the day.    Public transport is good in this area of the city. There is a taxi rank right outside the front door, a bus service passes through the Grassmarket and many of the tour buses stop opposite. The hotel is a short taxi ride from the railway stations at Waverley and Haymarket"
apex haymarket hotel edinburgh,positive,Great for proximity to the railway station at Haymarket and the tram stop. Well connected for services to Edinburgh Airport.
aph parking birmingham,negative,Valet parking so not a problem. Bus to the airport is supposed to be accessible but wheelchair space has no way of securing the chair. I sat in the seat as I feared being thrown from the chair with the aggressive driving. There is supposed to be a ramp but it was not put out for me.
apollo victoria theatre london,negative,There is a very good regular bus service with buses passing the door frequently and victoria train and tube station are in close proximity. Unsure about parking as we did not take the car. A friend drove to theatre and dropped my mum off outside the theatre door Nearest accessible Tube station was Westminster - about fifteen minutes on foot.  Buses abound and presume could be taken to the venue as it's located in Victoria. Didn't see any Blue Badge parking nearby.
apollo victoria theatre london,positive,Good sized accessible toilet in the foyer area. Were shown disabled loo on arrival. Given key to open it by cloakroom staff. Was spacious and clean and on same level as bar. No steps
apostrophe cafe london,negative,"Several bus routes will drop you off nearby but there are no step-free stations in the vicinity. An excellent accessible toilet, but one thing really spoils it: the red emergency cord has been tied up so that it ends well over a metre above floor level. Anyone who falls out of their wheelchair (not unusual when transferring to a toilet) will be left stranded with no means of summoning assistance. I'm subtracting three stars for this because it's really dreadfully ignorant and dangerous to hang the cord so high."
apple store edinburgh,negative,"There was an accessible loo which was very easy to find, however because of COVID-19 they weren’t allowing customers to use them. After a lot of explaining and persuasion, due to my diabetes insipidus,  I was able to use the loo. It was easy to find - good space - there was 1 grab rail and it was clean   There wasn’t a changing places loo.  Parked beside John Lewis"
apple store edinburgh,positive,"Great spot if you are arriving on public transport. If you are coming by bus, as I did, there are stops within a few metres for most directions. It's also directly opposite the Waverley Steps entrance to the railway station. Had to ask where it was   Spacious   There was a red cord alarm"
apple store glasgow,negative,"The store is in a pedestrianised Street. It is close to several bus stops, Central Station and Queen Street station."
appleby railway station appleby in westmorland,positive,Within 3 yards of the station entrance & easy level access.
apricot restaurant dunfermline,positive,Adjacent to bus station. Car park across the street. 
arbennig restaurant cardiff,negative,No designated spaces but off-road parking provided. Accessible toilet available at lower level but did not visit so cannot comment.
arbroath abbey arbroath,positive,"We walked up from the Harbour which was some distance and gently uphill but manageable. There is one street parking nearby and buses passing nearby. An accessible loo is located in the visitor centre - not the easiest to manoeuvre into to with ninety degree turns but functional, clean and bright."
arbroath cliffs arbroath,positive,Lots of parking available. They aren't painted spaces and there aren't any disabled spaces but plenty of room for any sized car. Also plenty of room to get out of a car. 
arbroath harbour arbroath,positive,Very good accessible parking bays right alongside the harbour. In fact once we were out walking we found another set of accessible bays the opposite end of the harbour - so full marks for that! Plenty of buses ply their way along the main road by the harbour. An accessible loo was adjacent to the harbour side.
arc stockton arts centre stockton on tees,positive,"There is a car park opposite which has disabled parking, there are also parking bays in the street outside the main entrance. The town centre where all local bus routes serve is close by. There are accessible toilets on every floor and are easy to find with the signage. The toilet was  clean and large with enough space to manoeuvre a wheelchair and had rails and a help button. "
arcadian car park birmingham,negative,The carpark had plenty of spaces (over 500) but of all those spaces there were only 2 disabled spaces. There were numerous mother and child and several electric car plug in spaces but only 2 disabled which were on the entry level. 
archaeological museum of chania chania,negative,"The museum is on Halidon, one of the main streets in Chania’s Old Town, only a couple of minutes’ walk from the Old Venetian Harbour. The street is on a slight slope. There are buses in the area and stop near by. I'm unsure about parking in the area."
archaeological museum of chania chania,positive,In the garden there is an accessible toilet. It has a single grab rail. I personally found the seat quite low. It was clean.
archangel frome,positive,"Although the venue others no parking, there are disabled parking bays a short distance over the road from the pub. There is one disabled loo which is clean and roomy.  Nothing to worry about here."
archerfield walled garden dirleton,positive,One of the best ever! It is really only if you have a car. No public transport options. Designated Blue Badge parking immediately in front of the venue.  This is on the Archerfield Estate and is not accessible by any other means than by car. There are two large car parks for this popular attraction. One can be seen clearly on approach but the second one is closer to the garden. Neither has tarmac. The blue badge parking is a small area found when you turn right just after the first car park. There is a small number of spaces (maybe 4?) which are paved but are not marked with cross hatching so can make transfer to a wheelchair from the side door difficult. Excellent. Almost a Changing Places toilet. There is a bench which can be lowered although I didn't see an overhead hoist. Grab rails on both sides of the toilet. Plenty of room for a wheelchair user and assistant. Very easy access to the toilet  via a wide vestibule which means there are no awkward turns. The only downside was that the red cords had been tangled around the grab rails.
architects of air nottingham,positive,Disabled parking was set up for the event.  Offered to get us closer.  Extra disabled parking was available as on this occasion it was at Lakeside Arts at Nottingham University.
ardardan estate dumbarton,negative,"It isn't the easiest place to reach by public transport, so going by car would be the option most would take.  It is a sharp turn off the main road, but has its  own car park with several marked disabled bays directly at the front door."
ardardan estate dumbarton,positive,"Standard accessible toilet facilities, but made to look nice, and in-keeping with the decor of the other toilets. Was large enough to fit wheelchair and carer in room at same time.  Unfortunately the emergency cord was tucked up so couldn't be easily reached if required.  But did like that it had a good mirror at a wheelchair-friendly height."
ardhowen theatre enniskillen,negative,The car park only has 2 spaces for blue badge owners so I would advise to go early if you would like to make use of these. However there is a drop off point at the front door to make the venue more accessible. It is asked that you contacted the box office in advance of using this facility. 
ardhowen theatre enniskillen,positive,There is an accessible toilet along the walkway between the auditorium and restaurant. It was clean and tidy and had enough for a carer or to maneuver walking aids or wheelchairs. There is also an emergency alarm button beside the toilet. 
ardrossan beach ardrossan,negative,Loo easy to find and has ramp to access. Had a RADAR key lock. Didn't need to use so didn't check it out.
arena birmingham birmingham,positive,"There are accessible toilets by every entrance to the seating blocks. There was a helper standing nearby if you didn't have a radar key, I did, but when I returned later to use the toilet I wasn't sure whether it was occupied as the red flap seemed to show that it was. The helper came over without me having to ask, knocked on the door and when there was no response opened it. That has happened to me before in other toilets that have a radar lock. The toilet had plenty of space for a wheelchair."
arenal beach platja de larenal,positive,"Many of the disabled spaces are actually free even in high season. People are great and do not park in them.  This year due to covid19, there are not so many accessible public toilets in Javea. However at the El Arenal beach  most restaurants have access to a disabled access toilet."
argos derby,positive,There is no dedicated parking for Argos but there is parking at Intu with large accessible bays (not free) and limited street parking (free if have a blue badge).  There is a bus stop but it depends where you are coming from.   Nearest bus station is Derby Bus Station which is about 8 minutes away. Nearest railway station is around 12 minutes away. 
argos edinburgh,positive,Great to be able to park outside the door! Buses also stop nearby if coming by public transport. Great if travelling as I did on the accessible buses. Stops on a short distance from the door. Not so great if coming by car as no parking outside.
argos falkirk,positive,"There are plenty of accessible parking bays immediately outside of the shop and level, smooth paving into the building. The nearest public transport is about a ten or fifteen minute walk out of the central retail park which is primarily for cars and pedestrians."
argyll arcade glasgow,negative,Close by to some public transport; particularly buses. Not too far from Central Station.
argylls lodging stirling,negative,"Available in Stirling Castle car park, but very difficult to get to Argyll's Lodgings from there"
aria resort and casino las vegas,positive,"We were in room/suite 36109 on our last trip this time we were in 35109 both rooms are identical. They only have one grab rail at the toilet so you need a ceiling hoist if you need two drop-down bars at the toilet, it didn't matter to me because I need hoisting.  NB: I made a point of visiting toilets this time just to see the setup for others and it seams standard just to have one hand rail and not two. We didn't use the car park but did use the transport to and from the hotel which was first class both ways. We were in room/suite 36109 because it had full access to the toilet via a ceiling hoist the lack of drop-down bars at the toilet didn't matter to me. N.B. any disabled toilet I went into in and around Las Vegas only had one wall hand rail and didn't have a drop down bar."
ariel krakow,positive,"The road parallel to the restaurant is a main road which has trams running along. I didn't use the tram while I was there so unable to comment, apart from I noticed that the new trams had wheelchair signs by one of the doors."
ariundle centre anaheilt,positive,"Parking just outside, can't recall if specific disabled spaces"
arkleston newmains community centre renfrew,negative,There is no designated car park or disabled spaces for parking.   Limited on street parking. There are bus stops outside the venue Newmains Road Renfrew. There is no train station in Renfrew.  
arkleston newmains community centre renfrew,positive,Clean and roomy disabled toilet with grab rails.  Room for carer.   
arlington national cemetery arlington,positive,"Whilst staying in Washington DC we hired an adapted vehicle that was wheelchair accessible and drove over the Potomac river to Arlington Cemetery. The journey to the cemetery was not easy. Driving on the right side of the road and a lot of one way systems made it challenging but the main problem was the lack of signage to the cemetery. We must have crossed the Potomac several in our attempt to get to the cemetery. We did finally get there. On arrival we inquired about disabled parking. There were plenty of disabled spaces.  There are other ways to travel to Arlington Cemetery including .... The metro. The Arlington National Cemetery Station is located on the Metropolitan Washington D.C. Area Metrorail's Blue Line.  There is also a Metrobus stop on Memorial Avenue. Information on the hours of operation, schedules and fares for the Metrorail and Metrobus are available on the WMATA website.   Both are just a short walk from Arlington gates. "
armadillo glasgow,negative,Haven't used them but am sure they are adequate
armagh city hotel armagh,negative,The disabled toilet on the ground floor could be a little larger but it wasn't too bad. In the room the disabled bathroom was great - the one we were in had a bath but ones with wet rooms were available.
armagh city hotel armagh,positive,We travelled by bus - the station is 3/4 mile away and the exit has a ramp and after that to the hotel is on the flat. Taxis are very cheap but there is no taxi rank outside the station so look up a number on the internet beforehand. Historic  Armagh sits on top of hills so you could get a taxi to take you up - after that it's flat. I wouldn't recommend the Roman Catholic cathedral - there is a path but it is quite steep going.
armitt museum library ambleside,positive,There is a car park and also access is the same as anywhere else in Ambleside. If coming from the village centre you may need to go in the road witha  powerchair due to poor pavements.
arndale centre manchester,positive,"The shopping centre has its own multi-storey car park with 28 disabled available which is located on high street.  Shudehill interchange is the nearest metro link and bus stop to the centre and the nearest train station is Manchester Victoria both a five minute walk or less to the centre. There are number of disabled toilets located throughout the shopping centre which are clearly signposted and easy to access. Lovely Changing Places Loo.  You have to ring security on the Intercom to be let in, but they are nice enough Parking is free if you are using the shopmobility scheme and get your parking validated.  Excellent public transport links if you're not driving. Changing places toilet is spotless and fully equipped, A++  Other toilets are a lot more busy and a bit more hit and miss but are regularly cleaned. All disabled toilets have RADAR locks. There were 3 accessible toilets in a row all accessed with a radar key. The toilet I went in did not have contrasting grab rails and toilet seat. There were white rails on door, around toilet & around sink. The mirror was also lowered. There was a large bin in the transfer space for some reason.  The tap was a lever and the flush handle was larger. Although you'd have to lean over toilet to reach it.   There was a changing place toilet downstairs near Shopmobility. It was in use so I didn't use it.  I couldn't tell you where the toilets actually are as I find with Arndale you just stumble up on things as I find it quite confusing to get around even though I spent 5 years in the city and accessed Arndale several times a week. "
arran apartments lamlash,positive,"There is a gently sloped ramp with flat parking area at the top.  For our rather long car, the flat area was a little bit short but was very manageable.  Travel to Arran was by Caledonian MacBrain ferry and they were most helpful providing parking on board close to the lift.  Wheelchairs are available for passengers to use and disabled toilet was adequate. A raised over toilet seat was provided with rails on either side.  An over bath shower was accessed with a bath stool.  This might be difficult if unable to self transfer.  A grab rail over the bath was provided.   All spotlessly clean."
arrow ford pontllanfraith,positive,Small car park with limited space. Difficult to improve because of space issues but assistance available if you need it Fully accessible facilities available
art of beauty dundee,negative,Parking is on hospital grounds so you have to pay for parking and sometimes busy depending on when you visit beautician as hospital has clinics and ward visiting times. Also minimum parking time is 4 hours so ticket is wasted if not in for very long.  Various bus stop located right outside the front door of the hospital.
art of beauty dundee,positive,"Changing place toilet on main foyer of the hospital. Hoist suitable, however bench is too hard to lie on due to my curved spine.   Felt air freshener wasn't working as toilet didn't smell very good. Tried to work adjustable sink, however it wouldn't work.  I first noticed the mirror above the sink and thought that's very high, but then I noticed a longer mirror beside which was good."
artisan cafe crianlarich,positive,"Café is on it’s own private access road off the main road to Fort William and Oban. Plenty of space to park near the café, no dedicated accessible parking.  Café is in a pretty remote location, so best access would be by car"
arts leeds,positive,"In town so very easy access to the cafe, and near to the Corn Exchange car park for those who need parking. Unsure but may be street parking with blue badge."
arts picturehouse cambridge,negative,"There is no specific parking for the venue. We used the nearby Grand Arcade's parking, which gives 3hours free when you scan your Blue Badge.  Cambridge is renowned for its parking being very limited and expensive. There's a lot of bus stops relatively nearby, although accessibility varies. I found it impossible to access the toilet without assistance from an able bodied person.   There are two doors - one into the toilet 'corridor' opens in. The accessible loo door opens out. When they're both open, they prevent anyone getting in or out of the toilet corridor! I needed my husband to open the toilet door (I knocked to show I was done) as otherwise I could have hit someone with it.  Its not possible to wash and dry your hands while sat on the toilet as the drying facilities are out of reach."
arundel castle gardens arundel,positive,Loos were great. All accessible loos had grab rails and plenty of space.
as watersports exeter,negative,"You can use the loo at the climb centre or at one of the friendly cafes opposite, but no loo available in shop I'm afraid."
as watersports exeter,positive,Disabled parking spots really close to shop. Ramp to get into shop.
asda barnstaple superstore barnstaple,positive,"Disabled parking spaces right outside main entrance The disabled toilet is a bonus. It is radar key controlled, but don't worry if you forget yours as customer services will lend one. The toilet is well equipped and large (more than enough room to swing a donkey let alone a cat). It has the following: pull down changing gurney, electric hoist that covers most of the room, disposable paper roll to cover gurney and tissue to clean up, shower, adjustable wash basin and what appears to be a non-slip floor. I only used the loo but was impressed with the layout. Clean and tidy"
asda coatbridge,negative,There are a number of Blue badge spaces located in the car park under the store. These are on the left hand side as you drive in to the car par.   There is good lighting in this area and normal plenty of people around during the day time.  As with all the parking in the store car park it is meant to be for Customers only and there is a time limit set as well if you are over the time you will be fined. This is operated by a private company for Asda. There is one accessible toilet located next to the rest of the customer toilets in the store these are behind the checkouts.  There is a good amount of room in this toilet with the sink and hand dryers at a level to suit people in wheelchairs.
asda derby supercentre derby,positive,Disabled parking bays outside of the shop.  The i4 and indigo trent barton buses run to the road outside of ASDA. These buses go to/from Derby or to/from Nottingham. The stops are a couple minutes walk away.  Accessing toilet is using radar key. White grab rails around toilet and sink. Toilet is right side transfer. There is a lowered mirror and lowered coat hook. Enough floor space for a powerchair. There are 3 bins in the loo for some reason and a baby changing table even though this ASDA has separate baby changing facilities.
asda edinburgh,negative,accessible but turning circle into toilet quite tight and the toilet is small
asda edinburgh,positive,"Close by bus stops available and lots of blue badge car parking spaces in the car park at the rear. parking spaces close to entrance. lots of disabled spaces I arrived on the number 10 bus which is wheelchair accessible. It's a short distance from the bus stop to the shop. There is a car park at the back with dedicated Blue Badge parking. Great accessible loo, plenty of space to accommodate my powerchair, and spotlessly clean. Parking is good and level access. Buses travel along the nearby main road and Lothian Buses No. 35 stops near the store. Slateford railway station is about 300m from the store. The accessible toilet was near the checkouts and had a wide easy to manage door, grab rails, and plenty of space. It was clean and tidy. Dropped a point as the door was obstructed by abandoned shopping trolleys."
asda elgin superstore elgin,negative,"There was not enough space to manoeuvre, but had to leave my mobility scooter outside in the corridor.  "
asda elgin superstore elgin,positive,Plenty of disabled car parking spaces quite near the supermarket. 
asda new pentland,positive,Dedicated bays near to the front door. Buses stop nearby as well.
asda newmains,positive,"If you aren't driving to the store, there is a large walkway down the car park that leads you down to the main street where there are very easily accessible bus stops, the walkway is very wide and flat making it very friendly towards people who need the space and need adaptable technologies eg wheelchairs or walking aids. in addition to this there are multiple disabled parking spaces close the the shop entrance. Toilets were large and perfect for their purpose, they were spacious and very clean, however they weren't at the front of the shop so maybe weren't so obvious to where they were Accessible parking has not been covered up for queues. I was able to park right next to the door."
asda newport superstore newport,negative,"There is disabled parking, but there could be more."
asda poole,positive,"20+ specific wide bays for the disabled - but these are not always monitored. The bays are well marked out and there are a good number here, however it can get very busy and you can end up missing out."
asda portlethen,positive,"Drove there, disabled spaces but few available - ones that were available had vehicles parked without disability badge. Accessible, plenty of space for carer too, close to entrance/exit, easily found, private, clean, hand rails."
asda radcliffe superstore radcliffe,negative,Easy to find No room to menouvor 
asda stenhousemuir,positive,Loads of accessible parking spaces and wide smooth pathways and pedestrian crossings. The parking is for the whole shopping area so there are plenty spaces all within close reach of the supermarket.
asda swindon,positive,"Many buses serve this store so it's easy to get here, there are very large car parks too so it won't be a problem getting a space here."
asda swinton,negative,The car park isn't great. High vehicles are blocked from using the lower levels of the car park and the speed bumps are very high and problematic.
ashford international hotel ashford,negative,"The accessible loo in the lobby was brilliant but the bathroom in our room had various problems, described above."
ashford international hotel ashford,positive,Easy enough to find from the motorway.
ashford international railway station ashford,negative,There is a accessible loo but I didn't use it.
ashmolean museum oxford,negative,"The Ashmolean Museum does not have a dedicated car park. Instead there are three disabled parking bays on the road outside the main entrance with further disabled parking bays dotted about on various roads nearby. This means that finding parking is a bit of a pot luck affair. I was very lucky in find a free disabled parking bay outside the museum when I visited.  From the museums website: There are 3 spaces directly outside the Museum, 3 more opposite the Museum close to the Randolph Hotel, 2 spaces on St Giles and 1 space on St John's Street. The toilets were fairly clean but unfortunately not very big. They proved a very tight squeeze for myself and my carer to get into and use successfully. We ended up feeling like sardines by the end of the day."
ashmolean museum oxford,positive,"Disabled bays on the road outside and on St Giles. You can use residents only bays if you have a blue badge. I did a day trip to Oxford from London. I went by train from Paddington and the journey was about 50 minutes on a fast train service. When I arrived at Oxford train station it took me about 15 - 20 minutes to walk to the museum. The route was an easy, level walk, apart from a bridge over the canal, which was on a slight slope. I turned left onto Botley Street/ Park End Road on exiting the station complex. I kept on the left hand side of the road passing the Said Business School. I followed the road and it was almost a straight road until I got to Debenhams where I turned left into Magdalen Street. Then the museum was in the next block. I didn't notice any seating on the way and on a Saturday afternoon the city centre was busy. The accessible toilets are not on all floors. I used the accessible toilet on the lower ground floor. There is step free access to it by lift and it was close to the café.   I also used the accessible toilet on the 4th floor where the restaurant is.  Both toilets were clean and spacious. There were grab rails and the emergency cord reached towards the floor. The 4th floor accessible toilet also had their own red cord card, see photo. It was lying on shelf when I arrived and I re-attached it to the cord."
ashtead park garden centre ashtead,positive,Four wide disabled parking spaces adjacent to the entrance. Unfortunately it is so popular these are normally full at busy times of the day. One large accessible toilet which has a light weight door. You can easily turnaround inside the toilet and the sink and hand dryer is at the correct height. I have taken off one star and it is not always as clean as I would like.
ask italian edinburgh,positive,There is parking in the city centre and the restaurant has good links to buses and the tram.
ask italian glasgow,negative,"Not a lot of parking nearby  It is adjacent to    Buchanan Street bus station, there is  also  an  NCP carpark within  yards of the restaurant.  I'm not hundred percent sure about the availability  of   Disabled car parking facilities on the street,   As I don't drive   And have always  arrived at the  restaurant  via my electric  wheelchair. Accessible   Toilet is reasonable with grab rails and  a  low sink,  however there is a lack  of  turning space depending on the size of your wheelchair?  It is sometimes difficult for me to close the toilet door  probably due to the size of my wheelchair.  The accessible toilet can be accessed by the use of a radar key. (If   You don't have one? The restaurant has one on hand   I forgot to say earlier that  there is another door to negotiate your way through before you reach the   Accessible toilet, the degree of the  difficulty for me is minimal but may vary for other wheelchair users? But again the staff are more than happy to help   Opening doors   Etc The disabled bathroom, despite being easy to access. It was just big enough to get my chair in, though my chair is not the smallest. Good placement of handrails and clean. This might be because you will need a radar key to open it. I had my own."
ask italian glasgow,positive,Good transport links. Just down the hill from Buchannan Bus Station. I'm unsure about parking as I used public transport. 
ask italian lincoln,negative,"Good ground floor council run car park on ground floor near/next to restaurent- however not accessible to large vans. Toilets in themselves are good, with right transfer, decent size. However if at other end of restaurent difficult to get to through all the tables. Tip- if toilet is essential ask for a table close to."
ask italian oxford,negative,City centre restaurant but on-street parking nearby. Accessible loo but at back of restaurant so access route difficult but staff helpful moving tables.  Small toilet area so no space to turn or for side transfer.
ask italian salisbury,positive,"Parking in Salisbury is rather confusing and that doesn't help the visitor. The bays need remarking and there are no signs pointing you to the disabled bays. This restaurant does have disabled bays outside it (on street parking), not to be confused with the loading bays though."
askham bog nature reserve york,positive,Plenty of parking  - can't remember if it was in bays. The carpark and first part of the path are rough gravel but manageable. 
aspire leisure centre stanmore,positive,The carpark has amply disabled parking The toilet had space to move wheelchair around in.  It had grab rails and was clean.
assai records edinburgh,negative,"Decent selection of buses from Lothian Rd, about a 3 minute walk from the Usher Hall."
assembly festival at assembly george square gardens edinburgh,negative,"Limited parking around George Square. I would recommend taking a taxi. None directly attached to the venue. Accessible loo available in George Square gardens during festival. Parking was the most difficult but there were a couple of disabled bays around by the University Library. Taxis will come in to the Square and drop you off. Unfortunately there aren't any toilets inside the pop-up Palais du Variete as they are situated in the gardens themselves. They aren't far away, but they also aren't the easiest to find if you're unfamiliar with the set-up. They are portacabin style loos and there is accessible loo provision."
assembly festival at assembly george square gardens edinburgh,positive,"Cannot comment on parking and bus stops as I don't really know Edinburgh that well. I travelled by train and got off at Waverly station, at first we needed to use Google map to find out how to get to where we were going. Once we figured it out though we found it much easier to get from the train station, to George Square Gardens and back again. There was not a disabled toilet or any toilet in the venue, however there is a portaloo just across the garden from the venue. There is also the PAMIS Mobiloo nearby, I saw signs for it however didn't have time to go see exactly where it was. Did not visit the disabled toilet in George Square Gardens either so cannot provide photos. The toilets for the gardens were of the port cabin style. An large accessible loo is approached via a ramp. Once inside it is large and spacious."
assembly festival at assembly george square theatre edinburgh,positive,Parking is ok - as long as you know where to find it! Understandably Edinburgh generally and the George Square area in particular is very very busy at this time of year. We managed to park on one of the surrounding streets.  Wowzers - we found the mobiloo!! I'd heard that there was a portable Changing Places in the area again this year - brilliant to see it... we didn't need to use it this time but it's so fantastic having it there... it means that it's accessible to so many visitors to all types of different venues nearby too... brilliant idea...
assembly festival at assembly gordon aikman theatre edinburgh,negative,"As the immediate surrounding area is pedestrianised for festival There is not much parking in the surrounding area but there is a taxi rank directly outside. There is a bus service a few minutes away. We took the bus. Nearest stops on Nicolson Street, 10 minute walk away.   Taxi would be able to drop you off behind George Square.  No car park but on street parking at Buccleuch Place, 2 minute walk to venue - however unsure of disability access. No accessible toilet. Need to get lift down to bathrooms."
assembly festival at assembly hall edinburgh,negative,"Very difficult to park anywhere near, best to get dropped off or number 42 bus stops outside. There is no parking. Disabled access is in Lawnmarket. You have to walk up a steep hill. However we went by taxi and although staff at Johnstone Terrace were not helpful the staff at Ramsay Gdns allowed the taxi through the barrier and after some discussion allowed us to the top and we walked down the Royal Mile to the disableddoor. Ok. First loo we were shown to  had steep steps! We did not use the toilets but noticed there was a bathroom with disabled access (upstairs) Parking is difficult at the best of times, best to get picked up, or head for a bus."
assembly festival at assembly hall edinburgh,positive,"Easy to find and spacious You can get near Assembly Hall using several different buses. You can go to South Bridge on the 7 (with a 9 minute walk to the venue), or to Princes Street (Scots Mon.) on the 3 (with a 6 minute walk to the venue), or to Mound Place on the 42, which drops you right outside. I would recommend getting the 42, as the walks to the venue if you get the 7 or the 3 are over cobbled/ uneven streets and uphill respectively.   There is no parking nearby, so you are best getting the bus. The accessible loo was less than a minute from the room the show was held in. The venue had gently sloped floors. I exited the venue to the left, and roughly 30 seconds down a wide corridoor there was an accessible loo. The loo was very large, with room for a carer. There were access rails throughout.   It was generally clean, although it was a little mucky- there were a few paper towels on the floor."
assembly festival at assembly roxy edinburgh,negative,"The was some on street parking close by but I would advise if possible not to take a car as I think getting a space would be difficult. There is a good bus service with the nearest stop approx 5 min walk away. The accessible loo was quite awkward to get into as there is a 90 degree turn to negotiate to get in. The toilet itself is adequate but once a powered wheelchair is in, there's not much space."
assembly festival at the box edinburgh,negative,"There are disabled spaces surrounding George Square but these are for permit holders at the University of Edinburgh. There is a risk of a ticket if you do not have a permit as well as a blue badge. There are many bus routes around the area, 7, 14, 35, 300, 31, 23. These have lowered buses and ramps for wheelchair users. For those who self propel or have difficulties walking it is a fair distance from most bus stops to the venue over uneven ground and cobbles. The nearest train station is Waverley. There was no accessible toilet at the venue. The nearest toilet was George Square Theatre but a wheelchair user would have had to go around the square to access the ramp to be able to reach this level. There was a Mobiloo which was a changing places toilet next to Appleton Tower which was just off of George Square. "
assembly hall edinburgh,positive,Disabled parking close by if going by bus thee is a short walking distance involved. Plenty room  Disabled toiled sign  Very clean  Staff helpful
assembly rooms edinburgh,negative,There is disabled on street parking but can be tricky to find at busy times.   Lots of bus routes stop nearby. Limited parking on George Street.   One-way system can make drop off in taxi tricky.
assembly rooms edinburgh,positive,"There are several accessible loos in the building. The first I tried was adjacent to  the ladies loos and was Ok although the presence of bins did make it tricky to manoeuvre.  Another, found later was through a door and on a landing overlooking the stairs. This was a much better and bigger loo. A wide easy to open door gives access, space to turn and manoeuvre. The venue is right in the city centre on George Street so you have options of buses, trams and trains. From the direction of Princes Street, your main hurdle is getting up the hill, definitely not one of Edinburgh's steepest but may want to keep in mind if self propelling.  We saw 2 accessible toilets - one in the ladies, which was quite small, and a separate much more spacious unisex one.  The only niggle was that you negotiate another door to get to it. There is some on street parking outside the venue, although, being in the city centre, parking is a premium. There are numerous buses, as well as the Princes Street tram stop within a 5 minute walk of the venue. The accessible toilets were very good. There are spaces reserved for disabled visitors just in front of the venue which is great. Lots of public transport too. Very good Accessible loo available on the same floor as Music Hall. Currently george st is closed, so unsure how close someone with limited mobility can park. Buses however are close by, many on princes st. Excellent - we got parked outside.Loads of public transport nearby. Great. disabled parking very close on George Street Very good disabled toilet facilities. Assembly Rooms are located on George Street right in the centre of Edinburgh so easy to find and good number of bus stops nearby. There is parking on George Street but it can be busy. Good sized accessible loo with an emergency cord hanging all the way to the floor!"
assembly underground leeds,negative,Didn't use so don't know!
at bristol bristol,positive,"Multi story car park across square from @Bristol. Plenty of disabled spaces on ground floor. Lift to street level. Flat walkway with no roads to venue Toilet I used was a good size. It may have been a sliding door to the toilet which I find much better, but I can't remember."
atherfield green farm atherfield green,negative,One of the reasons I chose this place was the wet room.  The loo has a drop down grab rail and a small wall mounted vertical bar - all good.  However the shower seat's prominent metal bar really dug into my legs. It had no side handles or back - not a problem for me but others might need more support. There was a large vertical grab rail on the wall to one side and a small one to the other. The biggest concern for me was the tiled floor - it could be slippery.   I would have worried about using crutches or stick to walk to the loo (my walker was fine). Shower floor needed care after showering.
atherfield green farm atherfield green,positive,"We could park right outside the cottage. Not sure how close the bus comes to this site, but there's a long drive from the road to the cottage in any case. The parking area is level and smooth. There is parking at the farm, in front of the cottage, but the area is not frequented by public transport. It's quite rural, so you really need your own car to get around."
atik edinburgh,positive,I came by public transport was easy to get from bus stop to atik. 
atlantico shopping centre antigua,positive,"From where we were it was only around two hundred yards walk, ether on the main side, or the seafront walk.  There was parking at the side as well as underground.  A large lift (as well as escalators)  went between the two levels I found the toilet spacious enough for my wheelchair, the drop down rail and pepermant one made transfer easy, as was the raised seat.  As one would hope in a disabled toilet, whether it be in the UK or Fuerteventura. "
atrium hotel rimini,negative,"No more than 350 m from the Railway Station. Not as advertised, repairs and maintenance was ongoing."
attenborough nature reserve attenborough,positive,"The car park by the Nature Centre has accessible spaces. Cost is £3 for parking all day.  If you were getting the bus you would have to walk for about 10 minutes from the nearest bus stop (by Chilwell Retail Park on Nottingham Road/A6005) to the nature centre.  If you wish to get the train to Attenborough its a 15 minute walk from the train station to the Nature Centre (walking along Attenborough Lane, Church Lane and through nature reserve)."
attic southend on sea,positive,"Paid parking to the front of the Cafe ( on street ). Bus stop not far away, and a big off road car park near to the bus stop. I have parked my car in front of the Cafe. To the back of the Cafe. Very clean and tidy ( spotless ). Space to transfer from chair to loo. Space for carer as well."
attingham park shrewsbury,positive,It has its own big car park that has disabled spaces very close to the entrance.
au six juin tracy sur mer,positive,"Easy to find, very clean, one of the best in Normandy as toilets there generally are not so good."
auchentoshan distillery and visitor centre clydebank,positive,"loads of parking right at the front door, slope access to the entrance Very roomy and great condition toilets for a public space. There would be room for a hoist and they are spotlessly clean too. A hoist is not provided but they are very accommodating so I cant imagine that being a problem if it was required. Nice light doors too."
auchingarrich wildlife centre comrie,positive,"On getting to the car park my wife went in first as I was a bit dubious of her having to push me around what look like  hilly terrain.  However she came back  with a map in hand  and assured me all was well.  I was surprised when she informed me that she was admitted free as my ‘carer/wheelchair pusher. The entrance road is rather rough, but disabled parking is near the entrance with good access A good accessible loo in the cafe entrance area"
audio lounge glasgow,positive,Free parking right outside the door. Can be busy at times but I've never failed to find a spot. Toilets are easily accessible *I've only checked female toilet. The cubicle is large and there is room to side transfer to the right of the toilet for left side transferring from chair. However there are no grab rails so if you require them you might struggle. Toilet is all painted white with a light colour floor so colour contrast is not brilliant but it's a (usually) clean usable facility.
audleys wood hotel basingstoke,positive,"There is 1 disabled parking space near the front door. It is intended for loading/unloading, but we were told we could leave our car there beacuse it was a quiet day. I parked in the car park located in the old walled garden. This is near the main entrance & all fairly level so we took the wheelchair back down from the hotel. I think there are more disabled parking bays in the main car park, but I didn't go there. The loo is near reception, large, clean."
audubon bird sanctuary dauphin island,positive,Disabled car parking at the start of the paths. No public transport. 
austria classic hotel holle salzburg,negative,Loo was accessable in a spacious bathroom but low and no rails.
austria classic hotel holle salzburg,positive,Free parking in quiet side road at front of hotel. Main road and bus route behind hotel.. didnt check out the public transport.
avenue london,negative,"Arrived by taxi. No specific disabled parking avaiable, although on street parking is available nearby."
avenue london,positive,Accessible toilet available on ground floor with good facilities. 
aviva stadium dublin,positive,"I always travel to the stadium by DART or just wheel there if I'm staying in close proximity to the stadium. Disabled Parking is available but must be arranged with the event organisers (this will vary depending on the event I know for Rugby games its the IRFU but other events like concerts, and Football it will change ) beforehand as only those with parking passes will be able to access the parking.  There are 51 accessible toilets located next to the Wheelchair spaces throughout the Stadium, they are easy to find and very spacious inside."
aztec adventure bromsgrove,negative,"Just over 3 miles from Droitwich, the Aztec adventure park was quite easy to find using sat NAV."
azzurro london,positive,"There's no parking but it's just a few minutes walk/wheel from Waterloo station and buses abound. Good loo, centrally located and clearly labelled. Clean but sadly no alarm cord. Good size with room to turn a chair and get alongside the WC."
azzurro woking,negative,There are blue badge bays on the side of the multi-storey nearest the restaurant (level 1 by the theatre) but it's still some way to the restaurant/theatre (inside the Peacock Centre) and you have to pay (the pay station is quite complicated and it's expensive).
b p international hotel kowloon,negative,"We asked for a disabled room, but was advised it did not have a view of the harbour and only a tub no shower. Other rooms with a view are not easy for wheelchairs as they are narrower doors, access to toilet was not very easy, the showers were cubicle, therefore I had sit on toilet and washed from the sink. I did ask for plastic chair for the shower, but none available."
b p service station shotts,positive,Good size and clean!
baba budan edinburgh,positive,Close to Waverley station. Get dropped off by taxi or park outside on Market Street (if you're lucky enough to get a space).
baba edinburgh,positive,"Parked with blue badge on George Street.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars, not 5 is that it isn’t the venue’s own parking."
babalu forres,positive,Ample off street parking with plenty of disabled bays. 
babbacombe cliff railway torquay,positive,Babbacombe is near Torquay. The nearest railway station is Torquay.  There are buses that stop nearby. There is a car park which is about 5 - 8 minutes walk away. There is on street parking or there is a car park around a 10 minute walk from the railway where you can park. On street parking was very busy but the car park was pretty empty - although I imagine in the summer it will fill up quickly.
bacaro liverpool,negative,"Some street parking, but we didn't drive."
bacaro liverpool,positive,Good size accessible toilet but chairs were stored in the area leading to it.
badaguish outdoor centre aviemore,positive,"I don’t know and public transport options, but going by car, parking etc is easy Lots of parking bays. You can drive right up to the respite lodge. All loos are accessible. There are also separate wet rooms with loos so plenty available."
baddesley clinton solihull,positive,"Parking was close to the house on compacted pea shingle. There were plenty of disabled spaces.  Nicely kept, clean loo, with grab rails and alarm. There is a changing table for babies that is substantial enough for slightly older children but would not work for an adult."
baie des lumieres nice,positive,Parc Phoenix has its own tram stop which is also called Parc Phoenix. It's on tram line 2 and stops about a 3 - 5 minute walk from the entrance. There are also a number of buses which stop close by. Parc Phoenix is very near to Nice Airport.
baillieston railway station glasgow,positive,Bus is great from the station only thing is on street parking on a hill 
bala lake railway bala,positive,"We got a return trip from Llanuwchllyn which is just outside Bala Town. Plenty free parking at the station. Although I didn’t notice specific marked disabled bays, we parked easily."
balans soho society london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby, though Tottenham Court Road station may be step-free some time in late 2016. Several bus routes will drop you nearby in Shaftesbury Avenue or Charing Cross Road."
balgedie lodge kinross,positive,Car parking next to the lodge Very well equipped wet room with everything you could need.
balgove larder st andrews,negative,There were standard loos but no disabled loos.
balgove larder st andrews,positive,"There are 4 blue badge holder spaces just outside. I had been concerned about the gravel but at the back and sides of your car in these spaces there is a pavement leading to the front door which solved that problem! Otherwise it would have been quite difficult, gravel is the enemy of wheelchairs!  There was a big sign indicating where the toilets were. There was a ramp going up to them, the accessible toilet had a wide doorway and bar on the back of the door. It is a big room with plenty space for a carer too. I thought I got a photo but unfortunately I cant seem to find it! The toilet is spacious and clean, it had grab rails and lots of room to manoeuvre. There was a red cord hanging near the toilet which I added a red cord card to!  Very clean. spacious room, plenty of space for carer and wheelchair user. Easy to access from the shop. We drove to Balgrove Larder. There are sign for Balgrove Larder on the roads. The car park is a large gravelled area so it was easy to park but the gravel did make it hard to push a wheelchair. See photos)"
ballare cambridge,positive,There is a very spacious disabled toilet accessible via a radar key. The key is kept with the cloakroom.
ballinluig motorgrill pitlochry,negative,There wasn't any disabled car parking spaces. There wasn't a disabled toilet.
balloch castle country park alexandria,positive,"There are a few entrances to the park. If coming by car, it has its own car park, as you drive towards that there is a (quite small) sign which points you in the direction of separate disabled parking spaces. These spaces are right across from the castle, and you can go along the flattest section of the park from there.  All the parking is free.   It is not very easy to recognise the disabled parking spaces though,as nearly all of the paint has come off them! Only on one, is there the remains of about half of a 'wheelchair' symbol. A WEE bit overdue a new coat of paint?  Balloch itself can be reached by train or bus, there are also several car parking areas. From the main street there is another entrance to Balloch Park, this isn't far at all from the public transport, but does involve going up a hill if entering the park this way. "
balmedie beach wheelchairs aberdeen,negative,"Just a disabled loo, but a change table and screen in the buggy bunker. The volunteers are trying to get a full changing places asap"
balmedie beach wheelchairs aberdeen,positive,"There are several disabled spaces, but plenty of other parking too"
balmedie country park balmedie,negative,Plenty of parking. 
balmedie country park balmedie,positive,Great - good sized car park which is tarmacked. Just be careful driving into the carpark as they've made it a really tight squeeze with some bollards. 
balmoral hotel edinburgh,negative,"The Hotel is at No1 Princes Street, so parking is limited but available right outside the main entrance - disabled access is via a gradual ramp to the left of the Hotel entrance, the wide doors are opened by a door man who is covid compliant.  We as always travelled by bus, Lothian Buses service has ample services on  routes from all parts of the City, this includes services operated by Lothian Country and East Coast, Airlink. A taxi rank is also outside the entrance. Being a former railway Hotel, Waverley Station is underneath. Bus Stops from the South and East are adjacent to the Waverley Steps 50 meters from the entrance, North and West services across the street from the Hotel next to accessibility crossing point. For services further afield k First Bus, Border Buses and McGills are also available. The Bus Station is also in St Andrew Square 450 meters from Waverley Station, Access to and from Waverley  is by lift, the Tram is 350 meters for either direction in St Andrews Square."

baltic centre for contemporary art gateshead,negative,Travelled to city centre railway station. Taxi to hotel nearby. Short walk (10 mins from Hilton Hotel but very steep hills)
baltic centre for contemporary art gateshead,positive,"Fine with blue badge park outside on road rather than car park Large spacious loo Did not use Changing places, toilets Walked here, large car park at the front. Accessible toilets where spacious and clean, I spotted on with a hoist which was pretty special (though it was out of order!)"
baltic market liverpool,positive,There's a pay and display car park right beside the market as well as on-street parking. We found a space no bother. I'm not familiar with Liverpool's public transport.
bamboo south queensferry,positive,"Large supermarket car park adjacent.  Could only see 1 disabled space directly opposite restaurant door.  Not sure about public transport in the area. Normal disabled loo facilities (not changing places) which would take a wheelchair. Grab rails, clean, tidy. "
bamburgh beach bamburgh,negative,"There is a bus service which goes to all the local towns/villages.  You can drive to Bamburgh and it has a large car-park in front of the castle, however it is a bit of a walk from there to the beach.   You could also access it from Seahouses (the beach connects the two places) "
bamburgh castle bamburgh,negative,"The disabled toilet was combined with baby changing, hence a queue, although not modern there were grab rails ang the wheelchair did fit inside.  Apparently used to be the stables."
bamburgh castle bamburgh,positive,"No problems, road up to parking vert narrow and scary.  But worth it to park so close to the entrance. As far as I am aware there are no other transport facilities."
bamburgh castle bamburgh castle,positive,"I was sent to park at the top of the steep hill, right by the castle entrance. Ground floor toilets available but not used for the general public. Spoke to the staff at the bottom car park and they arranged for us to park outside the castle which is up a steep hill. Enough space and had rails."
banchory lodge hotel banchory,negative,"You need to arrive here in a car, or walk from the village - I believe there is a train station but it isn't operational. In the lodge, the accessible loo is right at the bottom of the ramp described above with a sharp right turn. Some funky manouevring is required (reversing into the opposite room) to get the right angle to get through the (heavy) doors, but once in, the room and the dedicated accessible cubicle has plenty of room and its own basin.  The en suite in the large room at Cobbleheugh House has plenty of room. There is a large roll-in shower, but there is no shower chair. I don't remember any grab rails, but I might be wrong about that."
band on the wall manchester,negative,"Dedending on night of visit it can be challenging to find decent car parking close to the venue. The area lighting can become a bit of an issue the further from the venue you get. I'm not aware of any bespoke parking. There are parking spaces down side streets, having a blue badge means you don't pay, i would suggest going on google street view before going. I did not use them on this occasion."
band on the wall manchester,positive,"Found it easy to get to via public transport. Access to disabled toilet was brilliant, staff extremely helpful. Good access."
banham zoo norwich,positive,Lots of car parking but if the disabled bays are full you can be far enough away from the entrance for it to be quite a walk. The car parks nearest the zoo are paved but there is grass overflow parking.  I didn’t use them but there are several toilets around the zoo with disabled toilets available but no changing places toilets.  The toilets were clean and tidy with sanitising stations around the zoo
bank of england museum london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby except for the DLR part of Bank Station, which allows step-free access from train to street level. Many buses serve the Bank area, and I wouldn't dream of parking in this area. If you are VERY patient you could wait until Bank Underground Station becomes fully accessible in 2021."
bank of england museum london,positive,There is a very well laid-out accessible toilet in a corridor off the circular display at the far end of the museum. Full marks for this.
bank of scotland edinburgh,negative,Accessible parking in carpark centre but not very close. A good bus service runs to the shopping precinct.
bank of scotland glasgow,positive,is on a pedestrianised street no parking outside but is close to numerous bus stops and also few minutes from Buchanan Street underground.
bank of scotland oban,negative,There is no parking outside the bank and the nearest parking is next to the North pier area this is a few minutes away.   The main bus satiation is across the road and has a service of local buses.  There is also a Taxi rank
bannatyne spa hotel battle,positive,"There are two disabled parking bays, however there is also plenty of parking close to the entrance. The hotel is not near either a railway station or bus route. There is an accessible toilet adjacent to the restaurant."
banqueting house london,negative,"Parking is difficult especially during the day. There are several bus routes up and down Whitehall.  The nearest accessible tube station is Westminster, some 1 km away. See the overall description in the Getting around chapter in Access in London www.accessinlondon.org. After the +1 step to the ticket desk and small shop, an area called the undercroft is -3 from the entrance, but there is a ramped bypass behind the door to the left of the steps.  There's a wheelchair toilet (D80 ST80+) at the bottom of the ramp, which could be accessed even if you are not visiting the Hall upstairs."
bar 44 penarth,negative,"It is a small accessible toilet which is not helped by the fact that bins are located in the transfer area. On the plus side, the red cord hangs all the way to the ground."
bar home glasgow,negative,No parking of its own but lots of nearby street parking and town car park at too of the road however I wouldn't recommend using that as the ground is very uneven.
bar home glasgow,positive,Radar key system (they only have one key) good bathroom with expected bars etc. on the time of visit no cleaning equipment was using the toilet as a store cupboard.
bar mleczny pod temida krakow,positive,"I walked there from my accomodation, however there are trams that stop near by."
bar unico lincoln,negative,"Very tight, only one for the small cafe. Did get my large power chair in but no room to move."
bar varia renfrew,positive,There are plenty of disabled spaces  available if you are travelling by your own transport.
barack es szilva etterem budapest,negative,"We walked, but there are lots of public transport options on the surrounding main streets. Pavements are quite good in this part of town."
barbican centre london,positive,"The Barbican Centre is located in the City of London so is very central. The nearest step free tube is Farringdon. There are several buses that stop close by. There is disabled parking. The Barbican Centre is a large complex with several levels. Their website provides good information about how to get to the centre and there are excellent pictorial maps which show you step free routes from the nearest tube stations. Unfortunately the tube stations featured don't have step free access. It would be good if they updated their maps to include a step free route from Farringdon which is accessible. There is a Changing Places toilet with hoist, movable bench and shower, see photos, within their Beech Street Cinema complex. In the main Barbican building there are spacious, accessible toilets with grab rails and emergency cords. I believe it has disabled parking, however I have not used it. Transport connections from Farringdon Tube station (about 15 min push) and bus routes is very good. plenty of accessible toilets available The nearest tube is Barbican but it is not step free. The nearest step free tube station is Farringdon. There are several buses that stop close by. There was an accessible toilet in Bonfire restaurant next to the entrance. The toilet was spacious and clean. It had grab rails and an emergency cord that reached to the ground with a Euan's Guide red cord card.  When we went to Cinema Screen 3 in their Beech Street Cinema complex, I didn't use the toilet this time. However there were both accessible and Changing Places toilet. The Barbican Centre is located in the City of London so is very central. The nearest step free tube is Farringdon. There are several buses that stop close by. There is disabled parking. The Barbican Centre is a large complex with several levels. Their website provides good information about how to get to the centre and there are excellent pictorial maps which show you step free routes from the nearest tube stations. Unfortunately the tube stations featured don't have step free access. It would be good if they updated their maps to include a step free route from Farringdon which is accessible. There was an accessible toilet in the cinema foyer. There 2 doors both operated by push buttons. The accessible toilet had a swipe button to lock and open it.  The toilet was spacious and clean. There were grab rails and an emergency button on the wall at sitting height. There is a nearby Changing Places toilet located within their Beech Street Cinema complex with a height adjustable bench, tracking hoist system, a centrally placed toilet, a height adjustable basin and a shower."
barburrito glasgow,positive,"On the other side of George Square from Queen Street train station, local buses are nearby."
barburrito leeds,negative,"I've not used the disabled toilet here, but I imagine it is small and lacking full changing facilities."
barburrito leeds,positive,"Did not drive, but as it is in the centre of town very good public transport links. Unsure where would park if you drove, as would have to find an accessible parking space in town.  There is an easy to find accessible toilet, was in good condition.  This is in the city centre so there is a number of parking options close. "
barcelo aran mantegna rome,negative,"No parking as such but plenty of space for loading (as with us, and our minibus) and drop off zones (for taxis)."
barcelo aran mantegna rome,positive,Dotted around the hotel - a bit cramped though.
barcelona city history museum barcelona,positive,"We stayed in a city centre hotel and I was able to reach the museum just using the scooter I had rented, but I want to say that I found public transport in Barcelona generally to be very good, with accessible buses and mostly accessible metro. Also, the street layout in the old town was OK compared to some other ancient places I've been with a scooter, with a reasonable amount of dropped kerbs and not too heavy on the cobbles. A staff member showed me the way to the accessible loo because the old building can be a bit of a rabbit warren. It was modern, big and clean, with good rails and even some natural light from a high window."
barcelona el prat airport el prat de llobregat,positive,"Lots of options! On arriving at Barcelona, we used the Aerobus, but on the way back we used the Metro which was far simpler and the airport line is modern and generally more accessible than some other lines. There are also lots of taxis, train and regular busses to choose from. It's not too expensive to get to the city centre, no matter which way you travel. Generally great, although varied throughout the airport. A few I came across were built within the male or female toilets which could be inconvenient if you are accompanied by someone. No parking needed as we arrived on a flight.  On our first visit to Barcelona a friend who is Spanish booked a WAV taxi for us. Because I’m tall and I have a big wheelchair the taxi was very snug. Don’t let that put you off because the service was very good. On our return back to the airport we took the Aerobus, one tip try to get it from a stand and not a bus stop as you are guaranteed a place and you are not rushed, but they do run about every 10 minutes. The metro is at the airport but we have not used it there as the Aerobus is so easy. The one toilet I used was easy to find really big inside and very clean with a fresh smell. It had all the equipment a disabled person would need the only down side it had no mobile hoist or a ceiling hoist for a person like me who can’t transfer. "
barceloneta beach barcelona,negative,"The toilets on the beach are few and far in between, and have extremely narrow entrances. However, the cubicles are built in mind of wheel chair users, as they are very large and spacious."
barceloneta beach barcelona,positive,Disabled parking available.
barclays bank bristol,positive,Right in the centre of Bristol so easy to get here by bus or taxi.
barclays bank edinburgh,positive,"Bus stops are located right outside the door as is the entrance to Waverly Railway Station. A friend told me that there are also Blue Badge parking spaces available nearby but we didn't use them. Getting to the bank was easy on all counts. A disabled parking bay is located in the adjacent street, bus stops are outside and it's opposite Waverley Station. Not too far from the tram stop in St Andrew Square. Although not obvious the bank does have an accessible toilet should a customer require to use one. Speak to staff who will assist. The toilet was spacious and very well appointed with lots of grab rails. You can park in the disabled bays in the nearby West register Street. There are bus stops outside the door and it's a short distance from Waverley Station (rail)."
barclays bank hq london,negative,I arrived from the nearby tube station. It was a fair distance but easy to roll along the pavements in what was a fairly modern environment.
barclays bank hq london,positive,The accessible loo that I used was well laid out and modern. It lost points as the signage to find it was not that great. My observations have been noted by the bank and signage will be reviewed.
barclays bank leeds,negative,The bank is in a pedestrianised street so close proximity parking might be challenging. There are plenty of bus services passing nearby but they are a wee bit distant.
barclays bank london,positive,"Lots of parking in the adjacent car parks as well as good access to the DLR and Tube. That said, Westfield is enormous so you do have some distance between the bank and stations. The Westfield Centre has loads of accessible loos; including a changing places toilet."
barclays bank yeovil,negative,Bus
barclays bank yeovil,positive,Yes. AOK Bus
barnard castle barnard castle,negative,"We parked in the nearest public car park which was about ten minutes push away. On the way back we passed a bay in the Main Street just opposite the castle - however the markings were so faded, they were hard to make out when right next to them let alone in a car! Didn't see any closer blue badge parking or any parking dedicated to castle visits.    Buses must pass through  Barnard Castle but not sure where they stop."
barnett hill country hotel guildford,negative,Disabled bays are needed by the main entrance. The main car park is rough and uneven.
barnett hill country hotel guildford,positive,"Clearly signed just past reception. Push button sliding door was a nice touch. Plenty of room for me but no room for lateral transfer from wheelchair.  Well positioned grab rails.  If I have a criticism, it's that the mechanism to lock the door from the inside could do with a light or something to show its locked. I was nervous I hadn't done it properly and someone might come in - great in principle though! "
barnitts york,negative,As Barnitts is in the city centre there is limited parking. However there are several car parks close to the centre which are easily accessible. 
barnluasgan ex scottish beaver trial near crinan,positive,"There are disabled parking spaces at the Loch Barnluasgan car park. You do need a car to get there, heading from the Crinan canal(Cairnbaan),passing the Dunardry bridge turn left towards Tayvallich (signs for the Tayvallich coffee shop & The Tayvallich Inn). The Barnluasgan car park is on the left of the war memorial/ the turn off towards Achnamara.  There is a level pathway right around Loch Barnluasgan, and you can see plenty of signs that the Knapdale beavers are there, although I haven't been lucky enough to spot one yet.  There are disabled toilets in the lodge at the carpark but the lodge isn't always open(so this doesn't just apply to disabled users). I haven't used the toilets there yet so can't comment on how the facilities are. But if you wanted to pop to The Tayvallich Inn, about 5-10 minutes away for food or a drink they do have a disabled toilet. I only mention the Tayvallich Inn because I have been there and used their disabled toilet.  From the top of Barnluasgan Loch, in my powered wheelchair, I could get to the Bellanoch view point, it is quite bit bumpy in places(fairly sized gravel/rocks in places) so I could imagine a push or manual wheelchair user may struggle,but depends on how strong the person is in their manual chair or on the person pushing. There is a picnic bench at the top and the views from Bellanoch point are beautiful! You look right over the Crinan Canal and to the Loch and on a clear day you can see Jura.  There is also the Heart of Argyll Wildlife Organisation(HAWO) centre at Barrandaimh (the turn off,on the left, is just before you get to the Barnluasgan car park), which you can park your car at, although not as many car park spaces as Barnluasgan car park. Parking at the wildlife centre at Barrandaimh would be that you would cut out the really tricky parts(for a manual wheelchair) of the path up towards Bellanoch view point. Can't comment on the actual wildlife centre as I haven't used  it myself. The wildlife centre is open(according to the HAWO 's web page):  Centre Opening Hours:- 10am - 5pm  July: Every Wed, Thurs & Fri plus  Sun 15th 22nd & 29th Mon 16th 23rd & 30th  Tues 17th 24th & 31st  August: Every Wed, Thurs & Fri plus Mon 6th & 22nd Tues 7th & 28th Sun 26th  September: Every Wed plus Sun 2nd October: Wed 3rd Mon 8th to Fri 12th.  And if you check the Heart of Argyll Wildlife Centre's web page you can see what events they have on.  Hope this review helps!"
barolo grill glasgow,positive,"Fully accessible, equipped and spacious for a chair and carer well serviced and clean. There is on street parking outside. There is a large NCP car park across the road. Because it's in the center of Glasgow transport links are good. Fantastic large clean toilet."
barrhead railway station glasgow,positive,"The Station has a car park what is big and it has buses what goes to it, also has trains a lot run by Scotrail The Toilet is a decent size compared to most of them, it has grab rails and a pull cord"
barrowland ballroom glasgow,negative,"There is plenty of on street parking in the vicinity, free with a blue badge, but no dedicated car park. There is an accessible loo, a larger cubicle in the ladies'. Assuming there's on in the gents' too?! It is functional but basic. The main downside is that it's on a different floor to the main concert area, so the stair climber needs to be used. Again, the staff could not have been more helpful."
barrs newsagents edinburgh,negative,On street parking but normally very busy. Good bus service.
barry mill carnoustie,positive,Parking is in the car park at the top of the valley. A short pathway takes you down to the mill from the car park. If you can't manage the incline you can park by the bridge over the burn alongside the mill if you get in touch before arrival. A bus stops in the nearby village but it would involve a walk to the mill. There are toilets on site and these include an accessible toilet.
barter books alnwick,negative,Tight parking spaces Although there is some parking available close to the venue there are not many spaces for the amount of visitors it sees in the busy summer months. This may cause issues for disabled visitors as Barter Books is built on a hill so there are some slopes to negotiate. However there is a disabled parking space located just outside the building.
barter books alnwick,positive,An easy to find accessible toilet. A great size with a number of grab rails. Clean and well looked after. There is one toilet accessible for wheelchair users which is easy to locate and there is plenty of room to manoeuvre. Grab rails and aids are effectively placed and the toilet is kept clean. There are Blue Badge spaces right outside the front door. Be aware it gets busy though! We went on a Sunday around lunchtime and the place was packed & were lucky to get a space.
bartley lodge hotel cadnam,positive,"You need a car to get here. There's only one disabled parking space (not sure how many accessible rooms they've got?).  The car park surface is shingle so a bit hard to wheel on, though it's not a great distance to front door. Gentle ramp to front door. Loo in our room was great - nice wide door, nonslip floor, grab rails, alarm etc.  there was also a loo near lounge but it was off through a door and down a corridor. This wasn't signposted - we discovered it when we went to the pool. Whilst well equipped this was some way from the dining area and through a heavy door."
barton broad boardwalk at barton broad neatishead,positive,"A free car park just for blue badge holders which leads right to the Boardwalk.  It is a but tricky to find, but is in Neatishead Norfolk, NR12 8XP. The accessible toilets are a short distance in a different car park, there are no changing places facilities, but there are grab rails and it is fairly large in size. It isn't in the accessible car park, but it is by closely to drive to."
barton grange garden centre preston,positive,"Designated disabled parking near to the entrance, wide bays and aisles Normal sized regular disabled toilets"
barts pathology museum london,positive,"The Pathology Museum is inside St Bartholomew's Hospital (Barts). The nearest tube and train station is Farringdon, which is step free and the route from the station to the museum is flat. Nearby is City Thameslink station which had step free access via Ludgate entrance only, which will involve a bit of a hill, so you might prefer Farringdon as the stations are adjacent on the same train line. The buses 56 and 46 both stop directly outside the hospital. There is an accessible toilet on the 3rd floor, on the same level as the lift. It has a manual door but automatic lights. It is spacious, with grab rails but no emergency cord."
base sous marine bordeaux,negative,"There is free on-site parking available, however, the ground in the surrounding streets is quite old , cobbly, and full of potholes as they are doing up the whole area (Bacalan) which used to be  docks.  It's a bit of a wheel from the tram stop B over this ground and it takes quite a while to negotiate as you have to go slowly over the cobbles to avoid bone-shaking.  There is another tram stop which might be nearer and a bus too. It's not too well signposted  until you're very close, we encountered a few wandering tourists on the way! Although there is no sign for a disabled toilet at reception, there is one with the other toilets just off reception.  The toilets were cleaner than they appear in the photo; there was room to manoeuvre, a grab rail but no red cord."
basebowl saltcoats,positive,Key code and clean inside 
basel paper mill basel,negative,"Car parking very close by, within 20 meters of entrance Accessible looks available"
basement browns leamington spa,negative,Toilets downstairs in basement
basement browns leamington spa,positive,Limited disabled street parking outside. Large car park in next street that is free for blue badge holders.
basil indian restaurant dunfermline,positive,There is parking (three or four disabled) all along the street that the restaurant is on and it is situated a five-minute walk from the bus station and the train station is about ten minutes away. 
basildon district crematorium bowers gifford,negative,The disabled toilet was clean and spacious BUT had 2 folded wheelchairs inside so my Dad and Nan could not get in till these were taken out.  There is only 1 way to get to it which was slow going.  There was no key needed.  I also have a brother- in-law who uses a wheelchair and cannot walk though he drives.  If he attended here alone he would have struggled with moving the folded wheelchairs.  There were no staff about to assist.  The disabled toilet is mentioned on the site but not the spare wheelchairs in it!
basildon park reading,positive,"Disabled parking spaces & buggy that will take 1 wheelchair to & from house. Loo in old stables near car park & on ground level at house. Plenty of space, grab rails, generally good."
basildon sporting village basildon,negative,The car park is always very busy and unfortunately at the first hint of rain the disabled bays are flooded to quite a depth. (See photo). A bus goes to the retail park across the other side of the dual carriageway but it is still quite a walk to go through the subway. The 'dry' sports disabled toilet is very narrow and whilst it has plenty of grab handles is not accessible to wheelchair users. There are however toilets in the swimming pool changing rooms and also showers. There is also a moveable changing table with hoist in one changing room.
basilica di san pietro citta del vaticano,positive,We used the bus and no issues at all. Staff always helpful and usually waited until we had sat down to move on.
batchwood golf course sports centre st albans,positive,"You will have to drive to get to the centre as not any near transport links, but plenty of disabled parking.  Accessible toilet and shower "
bath town centre bath,negative,There are quite a lot of disabled parking spaces around the city centre outside the Indoor Market there are 4 spaces and just round the corner.   ( facing Bath Abbey ) there are three good spaces .....Public transport is mostly wheelchair friendly. Also some taxis have ramps ... Bath Railway Station has two spaces for disabled badge holders.... The station has good access
batsford arboretum and garden centre batsford,positive,"On site parking, free to visitors Yes, and it was clean. Grab rails, room for carer We drove to the site. There is a disabled drop off right by the entrance but we just parked in a disabled space in the main parking. From there, there's a wooden ramp I went down on my scooter and flat access to the site.  Decent sized accessible loo with all the other toilets in the main building. Someday I'll get into the habit of always taking photos of the toilet! Coach trip, good drop off point near entrance. Plenty of disabled parking space and good access paths for wheelchairs or scooters."
battlefield rest glasgow,negative,"Parking is not great in the battlefield area. There is a car park for the Victoria infirmary across the road, I'm not sure if this costs. The number five, six, and 44 have a bus stop just outside or across the road. Number 34 and 90 bus stops are close by. They had to remove seats for me to get into accessible toilet, but on the plus side they do have one, and it wasn't a problem for them. I took a photo but have just realised I didn't one of the actual toilet so I'm not sure there is grab rails beside the toilet. The hand dryer is very high on the wall. So if you have hydraulics under your chair, you will be able to use. For all the issues with the toilet. I am just pleased they have one in such an old building."
battlesteads hotel and restaurant creywell,positive,Parking by entrance in marked bays.
baumwipfelpfad schwarzwald calw,positive,"There was a disabled toilet at the bottom of the tower, but there wasn't one that I could see at the start of the walk.  The loo was fairly standard, with grab rails near the toilet and a basin at a good level. There was also a bin and the room was very clean."
bawdswell garden centre dereham,positive,"I could only see 4 disabled parking spaces and they were all taken! Very clean with good supports, paper towels close to sink and a mirror!"
bay burlington hotel eastbourne,positive,"The accessible loo is on the ground floor.  One has to negotiate a door from the lobby to reach the toilet and a wheelchair user may need to ask for help.  It is one of these toilets that are for everyone and not just disabled guests, but it is suitable for most disabled persons.  There are grab rails and there is ample space to accommodate a wheelchair as well as a carer."
bay dilkhusa grand hotel ilfracombe,positive,There was an accessible toilet by the other toilets. Fairly large but not big enough to transfer from the right hand side.
bay view garden centre carnforth,positive,Parking was good as there was easy access but it would be best if it was tar-maced as there were pot holes filled with water.  The toilets had room for a wheelchair and have handles but there was no hoist or bed.  The toilets were clean and modern. 
bayview cottage thurso,positive,"Off road parking is on loose chippings, beside the house, which is very close to the road. Access to garden is via the kerb and back through  a secure gate. Care  would need to be taken as you move from the car to the garden. Once through the gate , there is a substantial accessible non-slip wooden ramp up to the door. large fully equipped wetroom with comfort height toilet and all necessary grab rails. Host supplied a shower chair. Second cloakroom in cottage. "
bayview hotel apartments tas sliema,positive,In room
bb edinburgh edinburgh,negative,Parking is on street. Not that near to public transport unless you use a taxi.
bbc at george heriots school edinburgh,negative,There are apparently 2 disabled spaces in the  School car park but these were taken. Staff did not know how to get access to this car park anyway. There are yellow light nes on Lauriston Place and normally you can park there with a disabled badge. However no parking bollards are all along length of street on both side des. There are some spaces at the bottom and also my If new road opposite ( new meadow place?) but it is a difficult walk back up a steep incline . There is a bus stop reasonably nearby coming from south of city. No sign of a bus stop coming from lothian road end
bbc at george heriots school edinburgh,positive,One disabled loo with s ramp when ch actually had a shower!  Lots of space. Toilet lid collapsed when I pulled the old fashioned change n which might not be best option when you’re disabled 
bbc scotland glasgow,positive,"Had disabled parking, there is a bus that goes straight from town to the back of the building. Clean, loads of space, one on every floor. I don't know Glasgow bus travel very well however if you have access to a car, there is ample parking. Roomy toilets"
bbs coffee muffins perth,positive,There is a good disabled toilet
be love victoria,negative,"Be Love is located downtown, so public transport (bus) is very close by. My friend and I drove and found pay parking close by, but convenient parking could be tricky.  The loo was very small and inaccessible."
beach leisure centre aberdeen,negative,Parked within 50 yards of entrance to building at street level. Max 4 disabled spaces available so a bit of luck involved in getting one!
beach leisure centre aberdeen,positive,"There are 4-5 disabled parking spaces right outside the centre so there should be no real issues in terms of that. There are two accessible toilets. One on the top and one on the bottom floor. Both pretty easy to find. The toilet on the top floor is located beside the cafe and the one on the bottom is located in the changing area, outside of the sports hall. There are signs informing you of this. Both toilets are very spacious with grab rails and reachable emergency cords. Easy to find. Mobility aids available within toilets.  There are three accessible parking bays at the main entrance of the building. However, as I was visiting the centre as part of a wheelchair sports group, these spaces were all taken by the time I arrived. I went down to the car park at the 'event entrance' , and I called for a staff member to come down to open the door for me. Not ideal, but at least they have looked for an answer to the problem."
beach wheelchairs north berwick,negative,A few spaces to park down at the harbour.
beach wheelchairs north berwick,positive,"Limited beach disabled parking as in any other town country wide, But the 600 yard walk round to the beach hut in the harbour.  The Seabird centre is about a 400 yard walk to get to the disabled toilet and although not the biggest were clean enough and easily accessible. there were grab rails and enough space for your carer should they be required. due to the local knowledge and directions we drove straight to the nearest possible disabled parking spot without a hitch. I imagine this would be more of a challenge on a busy day We were lucky as a space near the beach hut was vacated just upon our arrival but we did then notice two disabled spaces near the hut that were also free after we had parked. We drove from Edinburgh so quite easy for us to get there. At North Berwick Harbour, then Yellowcraigs beach"
beacon fell country park preston,positive,"We drove to the venue, we did pass parking places on the road but we kept going until we found the main visitor center car park. As you pull in there are 5 or 6 disable spaces on the left, and as you park the ranger comes to see if you need help and to check on your scooter to make sure it is suitable for the environment. If he deems it not suitable he will get you one of the centers own Trampers which they keep charged and ready for use. The toilet block is separate from the visitor center and accessed via shallow ramps.  There are fully disabled toilet facilities provided by Lancashire County Council, and space to move around on a chair or scooter."
beacon hill country park leicester,negative,Couldn’t find it. 
beacon hill country park leicester,positive,There is a good size car park. no disables  spaces 
beacon leisure centre burntisland,negative,"Easy to find with space to manouvre/include a carer, but not super clean."
beacon leisure centre burntisland,positive,"There is a large car park, with disabled spaces near the entrance, and good bus routes.  However - Burntisland is not accessible by train to wheelchair users, as one side of the platform is only accessed via steps. (That's not really the pool's fault, hence the 4 star rating because otherwise it's great.) "
beam orthodontics dundee,positive,"I travelled by car and could park right outside, and just a few meters away there is a corner with dropped curbs for getting on the pavement, and you can park on the little street. There is a car park across from road. It is near the centre of town so easily accessible by bus and train. "
beamish park hotel newcastle upon tyne,positive,"Disabled parking with direct ramped access at the main hotel entrance, while the 3 ground floor bedrooms can gain via patio doors to their own dedicated parking spaces. Public transport I would suggest is non-existent and a car would be essential for getting around the area. Standard but really high standard disabled loo with plenty of room for wheelchair access.  Not a ""changing places"" loo but there are very few of these anywhere in the country."
beamish the living museum of the north stanley,negative,It was a bit of a walk to the main desk clean disabled toilets in almost every area. they had hand rails and it was easy to unlock the doors with staffs help if needed. Not many toilets around the place. Toilets are not disabled friendly
beamish the living museum of the north stanley,positive,"There is plenty of accessible parking on site with spaces nearer to the entrance for those who prefer. There is also a regular GoNorthEast bus service between Newcastle and Chester-le-Street which drops visitors off at the museum and has a ramp for wheelchairs. The site has a limited number of wheelchairs/scooters for hire available from the Reception. There are also period buses and tramps which operate in a loop, stopping at every area of the museum. Whilst steps onto trams/buses are steep there is a period accessible bus with a tail lift and capacity to secure 4 wheelchairs/powerchairs. There is at least one accessible toilet at each area of the museum with grip rails and plenty of space for a wheelchair. The most equipped toilets are located in the entrance building. Easy route in by car, from the A1. Well signposted. Plenty of parking, including accessible parking area, close to the entrance. The car park is quite potholed and not particularly even but this time, we brought my mountain trike and it was the right chair for our visit. There are toilets all over the place, including accessible ones. Parking was in a dedicated accessible parking area adjacent to the main entrance. There are plenty of toilets located throughout the site. The accessible toilets were fine, spacious and easy to access. A larger toilet with changing bench is located in the entrance complex next to the main cafe. We came by motorhome and on arrival were told we could park in either the accessible car park or the coach park. We opted for the coach park, which had a path running down to the main entrance. It was a fair distance but that wasn't an issue for me. It was more difficult when coaches parked too far back and blocked the path. Toilets in all areas and a small changing places at the main entrance. Toilets were clean and easy to access. there is good parking and is close to the main reception, there are also frequent buses that bring you next to the reception building. although the stairs are quite steep there is a ramp available to get into reception. Excellently signposted people in car parking showing where to park. Entrance to museum is down a steep hill"
beamsley project bolton abbey near skipton,positive,"All five washrooms on the ground floor, although slightly outdated in terms of aesthetic design, boast grab rails, bins, mirrors, alarm cords, shower chairs in the shower rooms, and a ceiling hoist and wash and dry toilet in the bathroom.  There is also a low bath in this room with a shower and adjustable changing table. Currently, the taps are all of the swing lever variety, whilst the locking mechanisms are small and circular, requiring a strong, clockwise hand motion to operate them. Upstairs in the Beamsley Project, there is one further toilet with the same facilities as those downstairs.  There are also two bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms."
bear derby derby,positive,Walkable distance in city centre. Space for taxi outside Large and well-designed
beaufort hotel inverness,positive,Car park round the back
beaulieu national motor museum,positive,"Dedicated car park for disabled drivers, nice and close to the main entrance! Beware there's a mighty slope to get to the main entrance, especially if you are in a self propelled wheelchair. Dedicated disabled  parking available close to the entrance with an another overflow disabled car park across from it.  The toilets were adequately fitted with all the necessary handles and pull cord but the hand drier is one that you had to bend your hands down and put them into the drier and was difficult to use if you have trouble bending your wrists and hands.  Also the doors into the toilets were difficult to use by yourself as they are big glass ones and they are not automatic.  I have no idea if the bus goes here - we drove.  There's plenty of Blue Badge parking quite near - though not right outside - the entrance. There were disabled loos at various places across the site. The one I used inside the restaurant was clean, well equipped and spacious: that one was radar key operated (though the staff unlocked it on request)."
beaumaris pier beaumaris,positive,Disabled spaces available outside the Pier with no payment otherwise you can park in the town car park which is an accessible stroll of 5-10 minutes. There is an accessible toilet in the alley way just up from the Pier House Cafe and Bistro (opposite the Pier). You need a radar key. 
beaverhall studios edinburgh,positive,"There is plenty parking or excellent bus services, the studios are on a direct bus route  Clean and very roomy "
beechenhurst coleford,negative,"As you enter the area, stick to the drive to the left, and follow it all the way round on right hand bends, which will take you behind the long building and round to the disabled parking area in front of cafe and toilets. It’s a downhill ride now to arrive at cafe, harder when you come back uphill later on.   Not a lot to say, it was there if you are urgent."
beecroft art gallery southend on sea,positive,The website clearly explains how to find the disabled parking. You do need to look at this before you go as it is tucked away but makes for easy access. There are only two disabled spaces.
beefeater deer park livingston,positive,"Plenty parking at adjoining Premier Inn Carpark. Dedicated disabled parking clearly marked, would think they'll fill up quickly as shared with the Premier Inn, we arrived about 6pm and got one of the last 2 disabled spaces Accessible loo at far end of restaurant, quite a long walk for those with walking problems. Very steep slope to access toilets, felt my wheelchair was 'running away' even with assistance. Reasonable sized toilet, tight for turning. Higher height toilet, plenty grabrails, and cord for assistance. Grabrail only at one side of toilet, I need 2 as I need to push up on them to stand There are a number of disabled parking spaces at various places in the car park as there is a premier inn  also next to the restaurant. We parked near the restaurant entrance which has a slop up to restaurant and premier inn entrance."
beefeater dundee,positive,"There is 4 disabled parking spaces directly outside the restaurant.  I asked the staff and they were more then happy to tell me where the disabled toilet was and the staff even offered to open the toilet door in order for  me to get in easier. The toilet was massive and spacious. Neat and tidy. About 200 yards from main railway. Good pavements. Car parking at the door. The council spaces (3) are free to blue badge users. Premier Inn and Beefeater have 10 spaces paid at £3 for 24 hours.  Good circulation space, all necessary rails "
beefeater loch ness house inverness,positive,There was a lot of disabled parking spaces but we decided to go around the back of the beefeater and park beside the premier inn hotel and enter via the premier inn and enter via the back of the beefeater. Excellent car parking.  There was an accessible toilet and it was pretty small but had everything that I needed.
beefeater packet steamer bootle,negative,Did not have the need to use but I did see the door
beefeater packet steamer bootle,positive,Four bays right outside the door
beefeater stirling,positive,"There is a car park with lots of disabled bays directly across the street from the restaurant. I've always managed to get a disabled bay easily despite the car park being used for the cinema and a few other restaurants that surround the beefeater. There was an accessible toilet which was a pretty good size. It had grab bars/rails, space for my wheelchair and an emergency pull cord. We had to untie the cord, but in a way I can see why it was tied up as it was very close to the fold-down rail and could easily be pulled by mistake. We untied the cord and added a Euan's Guide card to it. "
beijing banquet danderhall,negative,"The restaurant is pretty far from town so transport may be an issue. There is only one, rather small car park out front (no disabled spaces)."
beijing banquet danderhall,positive,"There is a bus stop about 3 minutes walk away, both the 33 and 49 go straight there from town.  There is a car park, plenty of space for taxis to drop people off and pick people up. Our members used it without any problem, it was clean."
beinn eighe and loch maree islands national nature reserve achnasheen,negative,Car essential but loads of laybyes en route and free parking at Ben Eighe and torridon visitor centres. Accessible toilet at Ben Eighe visitor centre but not at Torridon.
bekonscot model village railway beaconsfield,negative,"The car park is across the road. There are disabled spaces, but I'd estimate it's maybe 200m away from the entrance. If distance isn't an issue this is fine, but if you want to park closer you can't. "
belfast international airport belfast,negative,"What lets down the airport in my opinion is the car hire companies. Big names at the airport,  Avis, Budget, Enterprise/National/Alamo, Europcar and Hertz and not one offer WAV hire for wheelchair users.  We got picked up and dropped off so didn't see what other transport options were like. I asked about a Changing Places Toilet and was told that the signage wasn't put up yet that was the reason it wasn't registered with CPs. I managed to find the toilet, a lovely size toilet and had everything you expect to see in a CP toilet. The only down side was it was in departures so no access to visitors to the airport and passengers arriving into BFS could not access the toilet. "
belfast lough sailability carrickfergus,positive,"Parking is very good, plenty of space and close to cabin and marina. The site is just off the main Belfast to Carrick road next to a large supermarket and a hotel. The toilets are in the Sailing Club clubhouse, 15 metres from the cabin. The clubhouse was rebuilt a few years ago and so the toilets are modern and fully accessible, spacious with room for a carer. They are very clean. If needed a volunteer can lead you to the toilets. Some parking inside the Sailing club and just outside the gates. Disabled Toilet at the entrance of Marina building which doubles as a tourist information."
bella italia glasgow,negative,"There isn't parking outside the restaurant as it's located on the high street surrounded by shops and restaurants. We often park as close as possible in the surrounding streets or in the multi-storey carpark on Port Dundas Road, which is across from Cineworld and roughly less than 5 minutes walk from the restaurant. "
bella italia north berwick,positive,"Car park nearby with designated disabled parking , bus stop fairly close , train station a bit further away. Reasonably sized disabled loo"
bella italia windsor,negative,This area is always likely to be busy. To be assured of a parking space you need to know the town. Either that or luck is on your side. I'd advise public transport - just aim for the castle.
bella italia york,negative,"The inside of the toilet was very clean (a new venue!) and completely satisfactory to my lack of mobility needs (it even had a mirror!).  However, the access to the loo was blocked by a pushchair......"
bella italia york,positive,There are disabled parking bays right outside the restaurant.
bella venezia hotel corfu,positive,"I stayed at the hotel for 7 nights, and at the time of booking the hotel offered free taxi transfers from/ to airport for stays of 7 nights or more. The hotel contacted me by email to confirm the taxis details with me a few days before arrival. At the arrival hall at Corfu Airport I was met by the taxi driver. He had been very patient as I had been the last person to get through the airport as there had been a problem with my special assistance, and he was proactive in suggesting I stayed on the pavement and he would bring the taxi to me. The airport is on the outskirts of Corfu Town and the drive is about 5 - 10 minutes to the hotel. This makes it a very easy transfer. The toilet in my room didn’t have grab rails. There were also toilets in the basement, accessible via lift, which have no grab rail but are small so I could transfer using the door handle."
bella vita glasgow,negative,In an awkward place at a junction parking not great as always busy / occupied
bella vita glasgow,positive,"Lots of parking spaces at the rear of the restaurant. I believe there is also an accessible entrance at the rear, but I used the traditional entrance at the front of the building. Fantastic and modern accessible loo in an extended part of the restaurant. A lot of care and attention has gone in to the accessible loo, showing it is not just an after thought. Very impressed!"
bellahouston park glasgow,negative,Parking is avaialble in two main car parks at the House for an Art Lover off Dumbreck Road and at Bellahouston Sports Centre off Bellahouston Drive. Given the size of the park these are not close to all attractions. Accessible toilets are in the main attractions including the House of an Art Lover and the Leisure Centre.
belle epoque patisserie london,negative,"The nearest step-free station is Highbury and Islington, London Overground only. The tube part of this station (Victoria Line) is not step-free. There are no other step-free stations nearby. Many bus routes go past this café. I would not try to park in this area."
bellfield brewery edinburgh,negative,I came by bus (Lothian 44) and then had to roll through the residential area to get to the pub. Taxis can drop off right outside. The toilet is to the left of the bar and round a corner. It is awkward to get to if the place is busy as there is a large sofa along the corridor wall. The toilet inside has a great amount of room and is clean. The handrail was not securely screwed to the wall however which could have been extremely dangerous.
bells diner edinburgh,negative,On street parking. Not many drop curbs. Stockbridge is pretty central and close to bus stops but some streets are cobbled.
belmond le manoir aux quatsaisons great milton,positive,"Valet parking at front available for disabled people. To arrive and unload passengers, we were able to drive up to the front door.  The car was then valet parked.  It was raining, and a staff member held an umbrella over my husband as he assembled the wheelchair, and then umbrellas over each of us as we moved inside.  At the end of our stay, the car was brought back - no wait.  please see my review, this will soon be a five star toilet.  The owner will be installing a new grabrail Able to park right by the reception.  Staff will valet park if required (if all disabled spots taken), and offer to carry all bags / equipment to the room. Grab rails by the toilet.  Very clean, with lots of room to turn around.  Last time I was there, there were wheelchairs and other items in the toilet, but these have now all been cleared out.  Staff are always on hand if you need any help getting into the toilet such as opening the door."
ben gurion airport tel aviv,positive,"Can’t fault anything here at all a large spacious airport, not cramped and with clean and regularly serviced facilities. Our transfers there and back were faultless. There appeared to be excellent car hire and parking facilities for those who could drive non and mobility adaptive vehicles. Bus and train service connected to the airport all within short distance, there was mobility assistance available given the ramping throughout the airport.. All the loos equipped the same and uniform size for wheelchairs and Carers, "
bendrigg trust kendal,positive,We travelled by minibus. There was plenty of parking. The venue is in the countryside to transport links are difficult but there is a train station nearby. Toilets and bathrooms come with adapted equipment. 
bengal brasserie leeds,negative,I believe the toilets were at the back of the restaurant but didn't use them myself so cannot provide further comment.
bengal brasserie leeds,positive,The toilet is  well light and spacious with grab rails on either side of the toilet. 
bennetts cafe and bistro york,negative,"Toilet accessibility  is poor as toilets are situated up two flights of stairs, a hand rail is provided. There is no lift access available. Also there are no disabled specific toilets."
bentley priory museum stanmore,positive,"Lots of free parking, though there is a disabled allocated space.  Residential road means a concierge may open gate.   Didn't use public transport. Grab rails in toilet which is clean and spacious."
bentoya edinburgh,negative,Taxi could drop us off right outside. I think the nearest bus stop is possibly Lothian Road.
berges de seine paris,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Don't try to get there by Metro - the nearby stations are not wheelchair accessible. Paris buses all have ramp access. We used a 69 bus to get to the Champ de Mars, from where it is a short wheel or walk to the western end of the promenade. The 63 bus route runs parallel to the walk. Be careful to check on-line whether the bus stop you intend to use is wheelchair accessible. A few are not, including the 69 stop at the Musée d'Orsay.  We found one accessible loo in the course of the route. The approach is up a metal ramp with a totally unnecessary lip at the top, which is a small obstacle. The loo is spacious, equipped with grab rails and side transfer is feasible. There is an accessible wash basin but no alarm system."
berlin schonefeld airport dahme spreewald,negative,"I do not know anything about parking. I do know that it was impossible for us to arrange an accessible taxi from the airport. Ours was a short notice need due to a delay and we'd missed the train, so pre-booked cabs might be possible, but there's no way to turn up at the airport and just get a taxi on demand. Standard saloon car taxis are easily available. The S-Bahn station at the airport is about 1km away on a gentle (almost imperceptible) downward slope on a paved covered walkway. Inside the station is accessible on paper as they have ramps to the platforms, but these ramps are around 100m long and of a very significant gradient. I could not have attempted it unassisted, and even with assistance we were both in pain afterwards The auto flush is incredibly sensitive and you cannot get near the loo without it flushing on you. It put me right off my transfer. Door is very heavy, seat is very low even for me, and I like a standard height loo. "
berlin tegel airport berlin,negative,"I visited the same accessible toilet a couple of times and so I am not able to comment on others - there were only a couple! The one I visited was in terminal A/B opposite the information desk. It was very spacious with sufficient grab rails, very clean and with a low sink and mirror. The main problem was accessing the toilet - the door is pretty heavy and is situated squashed in next to a check-in desk."
berlin tegel airport berlin,positive,My plane flew in to this airport from Birmingham and I left for the hotel via public transport - a couple of buses. The public transport - buses or U/S Bahns - is a very efficient way of travelling around and near to Berlin - buses and trains are plentiful and very punctual.
berliner philharmonie berlin,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. The nearest S-bahn & U-bahn stations are at Potsdam Platz, & are accessible. They are about 10 minutes' wheel/walk away with busy roads to cross. Buses 200 and M41 stop outside the Philharmonie but are very crowded on concert nights. Buses M29 and M48 stop at Potsdamer Brücke which is about five minutes level wheel/walk from the Philharmonie. There is one accessible loo on the landing immediately adjacent to the wheelchair seating area. It is L-shaped but adequate in size, with grab rails round the loo, a wheelchair accessible washbasin and alarm buttons at a sensible level both by the loo and the washbasin. Be aware that when the queue for the ladies' loo next door builds up some able-bodied people succumb to temptation & use the disabled loo. If you need the loo in the concert interval, don't delay!"
bernies cafe deli bridge of weir,positive,"There is a large carpark to the rear of the cafe, which can be busy at times,  Bathroom with plenty of rails, an emergency pull cord, which is freshly decorated and clean"
berrington hall berrington,positive,"Disabled parking is available next to Berrington Hall or in the main car park, in well marked bays. There is a free golf cart lift service from the main car park up the hill to the Hall.  There are accessible toilets next to the main car park and the tea-room, both of which are easy to find.  They have grab rails on the walls and door. and drop down toilet rails. They both have room for an attendant, and are clean and tidy. "
berties proper fish chips edinburgh,negative,On Victoria Street which is not ideal for parking! Best bet is getting a bus to George IV bridge.
berties proper fish chips edinburgh,positive,"Spacious, modern accessible loo, but emergency cord was tied up when I visited. Also not a huge amount of contrast between floor and walls."
bertrams warkworth,negative,No car park. I suspect you could park outside.  There's a public parking area just round the corner. Not equipped as accessible but ground floor and central (by way out to garden).
best western champlain france angleterre la rochelle,positive,"I got a taxi from the airport which cost about 20 euros. The hotel is one road behind Place de Verdun, which has a small bus station. The train station is further away, but as I didn't use it I'm sorry but unable to comment."
best western dryfesdale country house hotel lockerbie,positive,Great - there were 2 Blue Badge parking spaces right outside the front door.  Decent sized accessible loo. The baby change is in the same loo but was safely stowed away.
best western kings manor hotel edinburgh,positive,"There is good and easy disabled parking in the front of the hotel.  We travelled by bus and the bus stops are very near, with a pedestrian crossing conveniently placed to get at the bus stop across the road. Good accessible toilet in the Bistro."
best western park hall hotel preston,positive,"There are always lots of spaces available and 2 blue badge spaces available right outside the reception entrance. More parking is available round the back. The hotel itself is a 10-min taxi ride away from Chorley Station, which is served regularly by Preston. "
best western plus alpenrose gemeinde kufstein,positive,Parking is near the door but I don't think they had reserved places for disabled drivers.
best western plus angel hotel chippenham,positive,"plenty of accessable parking in the grounds with n problem getting in and out of the building very clean, no hoist but plenty of room to manouver, we took a stand aid and there was plenty of room to use it"
best western plus cedar court hotel bradford,positive,"We parked in the car park and as mentioned before there are many disabled parking spots. In general it is a very large sized parking area.  Wheelchair friendly toilets. Disabled parking bays out front. A fair few were being used by non badge holders, told reception who sorted it immediately.  Only negative is the confusing parking system. Had my reg no. taken for a assessment/blue badge parking not sure if this covered me??? Very good. If in main toilets."
best western plus grims dyke hotel london,negative,No specific disabled parking and one suitable space was reserved so not available.
best western roker hotel sunderland,negative,"There was one disabled parking space, which was, of course, already taken."
best western woodlands hotel dundee,negative,Two spaces reserved for disabled parking in carpark but they are the same size as all others. There is no bus route close to the hotel.  Large accessible toilets in ladies and gents.  Two doors to enter which require help if both are closed.  Very clean.
best western woodlands hotel dundee,positive,Parking was excellent with plenty of bays situated to the front of the hotel amidst the woodland glade. Two accessible bays are marked out near the front door and there's plenty of other space. Buses run on the nearby main road so it is easy to catch a bus into town if required. The accessible Wetrooms were some of the best we have ever stayed in! Disabled parking directly in front  of  entrance 
beth chatto gardens colchester,negative,There is a big disabled bay but this could maybe be a bit larger and not on shingle
beth chatto gardens colchester,positive,Lovely clean loo with the others as well We drove to Beth Chatto Gardens which is situated about 4 miles from Colchester. A brown tourist sign is easy to spot on the A133 near Elmstead Market. The disabled toilets are near the entrance and are very spacious.
bettys harrogate,positive,"Disabled parking 300 yards from entrance. Very large with easy access. Grab handles. Room for carer. Same nice toiletries as the ordinary lavatories. I drove and found disabled parking bays right next to the entrance, which is large and easy to access. Parking is free. I believe there is also a bus you can catch from Harrogate the X6A and if going into the gardens your bus ticket offers a discount on entrance. Nearest station is Harrogate which is 1 1/2 miles away. I would recommend driving. There was an accessible toilet which was easy to find and very close to the café and with a large corridor and smooth surface."
bewl water lamberhurst,negative,There was an accessible loo hidden away. No signs to it. Medium size. Cannot recall details.
bewl water lamberhurst,positive,The entrance fee is £2. There are 4 or so disabled parking bays near the cafe but were impossible to find as the wheelchair sign was on a small post about 1 ft from the floor and very small. Only accessible by car as not near a station.
bfi imax london,positive,"Access is great... If you know where you're going!! We somehow got caught going round and round in circles trying to work out how to get in and navigate the underpass - but once you know where to go it's ace! It's really near Waterloo so was very convenient for us transport wise. Spacious and clean The nearest tube is Waterloo, which is not step free. Several buses stop nearby on Waterloo Bridge but there is a set of stairs to walk down. However the RV1 bus stops nearer to the entrance and exiting here avoids the stairs.  There was an accessible toilet in the ground floor foyer. It was located in between the regular toilets. The accessible toilet required a radar key. I personally don't like the accessible toilet being kept locked inside a public building, especially as there was plenty of staff in the foyer, checking tickets, at the box office, security staff and people serving at the refreshment counter, there could be regular checks to keep an eye on the toilet. There was also an accessible toilet on the 4th floor near the auditorium, this did not require a radar key and given the isolation of the toilet I would feel this one was more likely to be abused than the one in the foyer. Both toilets were spacious, clean, with grab rails and the emergency cord reached to the floor."
bianco ristorante thirsk thirsk,negative,"Parking and disabled parking on cobbles in town parking serving the other stores and shops around, restaurant located on a busy main road in and out of the town so be careful.  might be a bit small for some to get around the loo and the red cord see photo were hung and tied out not to the floor."
bibis cantina glasgow,negative,on Street parking adjacent front door of restaurant but can be busy up a slight slope through narrow area with double doors to disabled toilet so think would be difficult without help to access if in a wheelchair. Toilet itself  not huge.
bibliotheek kennemerwaard alkmaar,positive,Good space and grab rails round the loo. Not sure whether side transfer is feasible - we couldn't work out whether/how the baby changing bench (which is close to the loo) folds up. The washbasin is approachable and there's the usual Ditch round the room at skirting board level alarm cord.
biblos edinburgh,positive,The accessible loo is just by the bar - easy to find and use.
bic   bournemouth international centre bournemouth,positive,As we parked in the service road as our van (WAV) is 2.2m high we did't need to go into the car-park. I only used one loo and that was impressive even having a ceiling hoist.
bicester hotel golf and spa bicester,positive,"Parking is easy, you have four disabled bays very close to the hotel entrance, a short ride from car to entry, but it’s a delightful ride past honey coloured Cotswold stone buildings and a lovely courtyard. A lovely Oxfordshire drive and close to M40; junction 9, brings you to this lovely hotel with four disabled bays close to the delightful entrance crossing paved areas and past honey coloured Cotswold buildings. It’s all very level for you and the front door is easy to open."
bicester village bicester,positive,"Hundreds of parking spaces, disabled bays all near the front for shops, staff readily willing to support you. Outstandingly clean and easy to get to, room for all chairs and will be able to spin around in there. Grab rails and pull cord. Changing place as well."
big burns supper   spiegeltent village dumfries,negative,"Large public carpark near venue, 2 accessible spaces were some distance away, and had no drop downs to access pavement. Limited street parking available Public Bus Stance 5 minutes away"
big bus tours new york new york,positive,"Many stops around the city, operating both a upper and lower tour."
big waters nature reserve newcastle upon tyne,positive,"We did not notice any disabled parking spots on this visit, but will look next time and update here.   The number 45 bus from Newcastle Haymarket bus station comes closest."
bikash folkestone,negative,Used as a storage facility 
bilbao fine arts museum bilbao,negative,"There is an ""accessible"" toilet. Once you get inside it is fine (plenty of space) however the automatic door is very narrow - I struggled to get through in my manual chair and the automatic door was trying to close on me while I was still struggling to get through! Very very narrow doorway, I have no idea how those with powered chairs would manage as they are usually much wider. "
billingshurst leisure centre billingshurst,positive,Excellent parking for WAV Excellent
bills restaurant london,positive,Wide and accesible. A sign on the door would be helpful and save having to ask the staff.
billy bobs ice cream parlour bolton abbey,positive,"Not many disabled parking bays but there are a couple. The whole car park is quite flat though so its not really a problem. There are two accessible toilets. One in the main diner and one accessed from the ramp for outside diners. I've never used the outside one but the inside one is lovely and clean, big enough to turn around in and easily accessible."
billy frank jr nisqually national wildlife refuge dupont,positive,Big parking lot near visitors center with plenty of parking spaces. Nice and clean and good room for wheelchair access. Sink access was a bit crowded but still could wash hands fairly easily.
birch services eastbound middleton,positive,There is no public transport for obvious reasons. There are a number of disabled spaces by the entrance. Confusingly they are mixed up with the parent and child spaces. They need repainting so you can tell which is which. Has fully accessible disabled toilets.
birchwood food emporium dundee,negative,"There is one unisex toilet which I wouldn’t say is very wheelchair accessible. It is a long narrow toilet and you are not able to get to the further side of the toilet due to the narrowness. I think there might be enough room for a wheelchair user and someone to assist them but, I’m not 100% sure as I just got my helper to take a photo. There are grab rails beside the toilet but no emergency red cord.  The closest Changing Place toilet is at the V&A which is open till at least 5pm everyday of the week. There is an accessible toilet but it's a little tricky to get in (see pics). There are two parts to it, both doors were open, you go through one doorway then turn left into the bathroom. There is not enough space for my wheelchair to turn into the toilet but a manual chair should be able to. I left my chair in the first area as its just a few steps to the toilet and there are grab rails. There was no red cord though. It was clean and tidy. "
birchwood food emporium dundee,positive,"With this café being directly in the city centre of Dundee there are lots of parking spaces available. There are a few of council car parks nearby where blue badge holders can park free, and there are some onstreet parking spaces also available.  The train station is roughly a 10 minute walk away and there are bus stops nearby that go around the Dundee and Angus area. This cafe is in the centre of town near to car parks, the train station, bus station and bus stops. There is some on street parking with the blue badge. "
bird and bear dundee,negative,"There is a toilet you can get to in a wheelchair but no space for the wheelchair in the room, its the size of a small cupboard!"
bird and bear dundee,positive,"When I visited here I got a parking space right outside by the street. This was because the 2 council car parks that are at either side of this restaurant were full, one is right across the road and the other is a 5 minute walk away. Basically due to the restaurant being in the city centre there are plenty of parking spaces nearby and taxi ranks around the town.  There are also lots of bus stops on mainly every street where buses visit regularly from all over Dundee and Angus. The train station is also just roughly a 10 minute walk away, on the other side of Slessor Gardens."
birdworld farnham,negative,We used the accessible toilet opposite the garden centre by the wildlife garden area. The space was large - lacking in coat pegs and emergency cord. No baby change present. No continence pad bin. The site has a number of toilets but no changing places. The sink was not standard and can’t be reached from the toilet.  See pictures below.
birdworld farnham,positive,"We drove and used the blue badge spaces which were very easily located and in good supply despite our slightly late arrival.  Birdworld was also well sign posted Great, there was an accessible toilet at each set of toilets with no exception which is far better than a lot of places I've been to!!! Lots of disabled parking spaces. Most of the carpark is tarmac but the overflow parking is on grass There was an accessible toilet by the entrance and then several more around the park We drove and there were many blue badge bays on a hard flat surface near the entrance. "
birkenhead priory birkenhead,negative,Regular disabled toilet
birkhill inn birkhill,negative,Well signed.  Door opens inwards which is a bit awkward.  There is room for a wheelchair and carer but space is rather tight.  A drop-down grab rail at one side of toilet only.  Clean.
birkhill inn birkhill,positive,Disabled parking outside entrance.  On bus route.
birks cinema aberfeldy,negative,The parking is good as you can park in the spaces if there's any left near the spa post office.  The parking is good as you can park along the street by the thrift shop and near the spa post office. 
birks cinema aberfeldy,positive,"Lots of on street parking.  Well equipped with sturdy features. Side transfer space from left of loo seat. Shares space with baby changing. The red cord was too short and strangely it wa located just as inside the door, as far away from pan as possibles. On the day of my visit the lighting was not working but Manager was seeking a solution. "
birmingham botanical gardens and glasshouses birmingham,negative,A disabled toilet is situated at the right hand end of the Main Reception as you enter. There are several Disabled toilets situated throughout the gardens however there is no accessibility in the Tearooms. 
birmingham botanical gardens and glasshouses birmingham,positive,Disabled parking bays are located on first row of car park by welcome sign and clearly marked out in blue. Blue badge must be displayed. Some areas of the car park are sloped and do become slippery when icy. 
birmingham hippodrome birmingham,positive,There were two on the floor we used. They were clean and roomy
birmingham international railway station marston green,positive,Good station access. The accessible toilet is in the main concourse area and is clearly signposted. It has a RADAR lock. There's plenty of space to turn a powerchair.
birmingham museum art gallery birmingham,negative,Visit the Birmingham Museums website for directions on how to get there. It is located in central Birmingham but don't let that put you off as it's fairly easy to find. I parked in the four dedicated disabled parking places alongside the museum on Margaret Street. It could have been awkward as I need room at the back of my vehicle to unload and load my powerchair and only the outer two spaces had room to do this. Luckily I managed to get one! The wheelchair accessible lift entrance to the museum is on Edmund Street which is pedestrianised. The best disabled loo is on the top floor to the left of the lift exit. There was just enough room for my carer and me and my powerchair. It was clean and tidy the first time I used it but the second time I used it the toilet needed a good clean before it was usable. The disabled loo in the main entrance to the museum is too small for a powerchair. I mistakenly went in and found that I was completely trapped until I gingerly reversed back out!
birmingham new street railway station birmingham,negative,"Few disabled bays with shocking prices. There are disable parking bays in car parks reasonably close to Birmingham New street station, but expensive. Most Birmingham buses have bus stops near to station entrance, but that’s hard work, so we prefer to travel in to station by train, leaving our car at home, or in free disabled space at nearest station to home. So far, we have not experienced any theft or problems by so doing.  Then this cuts out a lot of trouble during our journey into station. We did not find any disabled toilets, all seem to be either sharing male and female, or if separated, very busy, and not always as clean as we would like."
birmingham new street railway station birmingham,positive,"There are only disabled loos beyond the ticket barriers.  Seems to have good access, but as I don't drive I can't comment on the parking, there do seem to be multi storey carparks very close to this station. Did not use the toilets. Will review next time. Last time I went to toilet at this station it was a nightmare as there are ""zones"" and trying to access a different ""zone"" when the toilet in your ""zone"" was out of order, was a nightmare.   According to Google this station has a changing place facility on the eastern concourse...they could provide better directions because as an outsider I'd have no clue where that was. "
birmingham repertory theatre birmingham,negative,"It was easy to find and there were two in the theatre, both of which were in use while we were there. Fortunately, the REP is attached to Birmingham Central Library, which has multiple accessible toilets.  We have since visited this location again, and discovered that although there are 2 accessible toilets, theatre policy is for some reason to lock one of them after the performance has finished. Although this does cause problems, the downstairs toilet remains open (RADAR key only).  It is also worth mentioning that Birmingham Central Library closes in the evening, meaning that their toilets are only accessible during and after a matinee performance."
birnam arts centre birnam,negative,No designated accessible parking...although on street parking with variable dropped kerbs were available close to the accessible ramped entrance There is a bus stop nearby and also parking spaces especially for disabled parking which is near to the entrance of the building.
birnam arts centre birnam,positive,Easy to use nice big space
birnie loch cupar,negative,"Only one marked disabled parking bay in the car park which only holds about 20 cars. Probably not an issue during the week but it can get busy at weekends. Disabled bay numbers currently being reviewed by Fife countryside trust who manage the facility. Nearest large town is Cupar for facilities about 5 miles away. Between Cupar and Auchtermuchty , look for signs to Charlottetown. Entrance to car park not well signposted so be alert just after the junction."
bistrot pierre birmingham,positive,There are several designated disabled parking spaces on Gas Street - occupied by builders vans on our visit! Fortunately there are Pay and Display spaces. We used on of those and with a blue badge it is free.   We manage to park pretty much right  outside the restaurant. Disabled toilet was excellent. A good size. Spotlessly clean. The wasn't heavy  either. The door did have a RADAR lock fitted but I didn't need my key when we visited 
bistrot pierre cardiff,negative,Reasonable sized accessible loo (see pic - no room for side transfer) but corridor to loos narrowed by stack of high chairs.
bites n pieces paisley,negative,Travelled by car. Parked in a side street - but no car park
bites n pieces paisley,positive,Toilet accessible. clean
black bull edinburgh,negative,Not specifically an accessible toilet but the toilets are all on one level and spacious. 
black bull edinburgh,positive,The Black Bull is on Leith Street so within short walking distance of Waverley Station and local bus routes. 
black bull inn moffat,negative,Parking is on street but there is plenty nearby.  
black bull inn moffat,positive,Ample both in Room 16 and in pub/restaurant 
black country living museum dudley,positive,"Good, monitored accessible car park.  They divert disabled drivers to additional proximal parking when the lot fills.  There is now an accessible bus that goes around the site. Signage is a bit odd due to nature of facility, but staff were helpful - there is access to a changing places toilet, too.  There is plenty of free disabled parking. I came on the train. The local station is Tipton and is fully accessible but unstaffed. The pavements to the museum however are horrendous due to tree roots and I kept having to cross the road or roll in the road.  No changing places facilties but there was a reasonable sized clean accessible loo available near the cafe. However there were several bins in there. Grab rails & toilet seat weren't of a contrasting colour."
black forest open air museum ortenaukreis,positive,"You can get to the museum by bus and car, and it also has a small train station. We got there by car. The museum is situated by a main road so it is easy to get there and there are several disabled parking spaces. There were two disabled toilets on the site, however one was inaccessible due to a lift not working. The other toilet was situated in the visitor centre. It was a reasonable size and had grab rails and a suitable bin, but the changing table got in the way a bit as it didn't appear to fold. The room was quite clean."
black isle bar rooms inverness,positive,Didn’t go inside but it was instantly easy to find with a big door and a vast amount of space in front of it - they didn’t try to cram in more tables which is excellent.  There are several disabled spaces nearby. it's quite close to the bus & rail stations There is a lovely big disabled toilet & t's nice & clean.
black isle christmas trees inverness,positive,"You would need a car to access the farm and take a tree home but there was plenty of parking available on the farm.  There was no specific disabled parking as such as it is a farm rather than a commercial car park but the road surface was smooth and I don't think there would be any problem getting a space.  If there was a problem at busier times, I'm sure the staff would be happy to help."
black ivy edinburgh,negative,"I came by wheelchair but I saw single yellow line parking outside. Lothian buses 11, 15, 16, 23 and 36 stop nearby,"
black ivy edinburgh,positive,We drove to the black ivy. We were lucky it was really quiet and managed to park on the street just beside the entrance.It may not be as easy to park at weekends and other times of the year. Great disabled toilet (see photo). It’s  spacious and has an emergency red Cord. There is a sink and a mirror which are both at a suitable height for wheelchair users. There is also a baby changing unit. There are some good public transport links nearby as Black Ivy is just off Bruntsfield Place where there are many bus stops. Parking can be quite busy depending on the time of day and not sure if there are any dedicated blue badge spaces nearby. Very smart accessible loo! If the bar is busy it is a little trickier to get to with how some of the seating is arranged but this is just a small thing. Accessible loo is through a door at the back and on right hand side. Inside there is a level mirror and space for chair and carer. The baby change tray has braille. Red cord is to left of the toilet and reaches the floor.
black pig oyster edinburgh,positive,"Taxi could park outside on Commercial St, dead easy. There are disabled parking spaces on the other side of the building (Commercial Quay) but that's the wrong side for the accessible entrance. Plenty of room to manouevre. Very clean."
black sheep brewery ripon,positive,"Two disabled spaces, near loft. One toilet with no access problem but not large.."
blackbird bakery london,positive,Balham Station is very nearby. It's step-free for National Rail services but NOT step-free for the underground.  Zillions of buses whizz past nearby. 
blackbird rathmines rathmines,positive,"Parking available across the road There is plenty of on street parking across the road on Military Road. They have a wheelchair bathroom! Huzzah! And it is big! However, the mirror is up way too high so if you're in a wheelchair, you'll just have to assume that you look great. Which you always do, you ride."
blackbrooks garden centre saint leonards on sea,positive,"There is plenty of parking, with labelled disabled spaces, although they appear no wider than the other spaces. I would recommend parking in the overflow car park if you are able to manage being slighter further from the entrance.  There is a nearby bus stop on Bexhill Road, serviced by the low floor 98 and 99 buses.  There is a single disabled toilet located next to the tearoom, no radar key necessary.  The toilet is spacious and has plenty of grab handles, although they are white against white walls.  There is plenty of room for the wheelchair user and a carer, but no adult changing space. I had no problem turning my powerchair and positioning next to the toilet.  Transfer is to the left of your wheelchair when parked next to the toilet.  It’s worth noting that the door is difficult to open for those with weaker arms and hands. The “door handle” is the small finger hook design used on many Radar systems, and there is an automatic closing mechanism on the door.  There is no mirror available within the room. "
blacketyside farm shop leven,negative,"I presume buses stop at entrance, infact I think i recall a bus stop across the road.  We always drive..car park chipped surface but disabled spaces at door. I cannot recall the loo but know they are nearby and not a trek. Will update this section next time i visit Large carpark but not many blue badge spaces near entrance. Car park surface rough so diff to push a chair or to walk with sticks. There is a disabled to toilet but you have to negotiate the tea rooms to get to it."
blacketyside farm shop leven,positive,Several disabled parking spaces. Bus stop close to entrance. Regular service. Car park surface is pebbles - not easy for wheelchair users.
blackfriars priory gloucester,positive,There is disabled parking right outside in the Council run car park whick is free for 3 hours.
blackness castle linlithgow,negative,"The Castle is a bit of the way, I am really glad my friend drove out, it is about a hours drive from Edinburgh City and 15 minutes from Linlithgow. I had planned on using a  mixture trains and buses but knew I had to be very time reliant on buses etc.  There is a car park in the castle grounds, spaces are not marked out and there was no designated disabled space.   No disabled toilet. Non disabled gents and ladies loos in visitor centre - you need to get up the three larger steps to reach them. There were toilets but not sure if accessible Acceptable"
blackness castle linlithgow,positive,Parking virtually next to the castle
blackpool grand theatre blackpool,negative,"There is no Disabled Parking at the Grand Theatre, the theatre does have any!  The only Disabled parking near by and metres away too, is either on-street disabled parking bays, check with Blackpool Council, or off-road disabled parking in public car parks again metres away too. If you have a large class 1, or 2 wheelchair, you and any carer or family member, will have issues with this disabled toilet, if you use a Bariatric Wheelchair forget it, there is no Changing Place facility.   There seems only to be one disabled toilet for a theatre which can seat over a thousand people.  The disabled toilet, fails to provide for Sensory Disabled People, yes some grab rails are blue, but not all of them.  Then the fitting of these grab rails is questionable too, the wrong screws or bolts used, the walls maybe be not fully load bearing for heavily disabled people too. The fold down Grab rail by the side of the toilet especially, it has no drop-down support leg to help support your weight it seems too.  There is no audio information and navigation speaker, to direct a visually impaired or blind disabled person around the disabled toilet.  No Audio Visual alarm system for hearing and visually impaired too, but these do not seem provided elsewhere either!"
blackpool grand theatre blackpool,positive,The theatre is in the town centre with no on street parking. There are several car parks within close proximity with blue bags free of charge. Drop off & pick up outside the theatre is possible. Several.buses stop opposite the theatre. There's also a taxi rank just outside too. On a bit of a slope which is carpeted which my powerchair wasn't too happy about! 
blackpool illuminations blackpool,positive,Grab an accessible tram and take a ride or simply drive yourself along the length of the prom to enjoy the lights.
blackpool model village gardens blackpool,negative,"Ladies toilet had a steep but short ramp to get in and labelled up as the disabled toilet. Gents toilet not accessible, no alternative toilets available, no companion toilets available. The parking area is about 60 meters to the left of the gate into the venue however there are no parking spaces marked out and the car park contains a lot of lose stones an gravel that are not ideal for wheelchair users. There is a charge for the park car on top of your ticket price  A good but basic accessible toilet it was very clean and had grip rails available but not Red cord available the toilet is next to the ladies toilet right next to the ticket point shop café  You access the toilet via a ramp the first door was open  once through this the door was a head of you and opened out the way.  The sink for the ladies toilet is in the area you pass through and so care is required when you open the door in case children are standing waiting on mum   "
blackpool model village gardens blackpool,positive,"Venue had a level car park (fee still payable by blue badge holders), although venue was on road with double yellow line allowing three hour free parking with blue badge, and this ended up being closer to venue than payable car park. "
blackpool north railway station blackpool,negative,We took a Taxi to the station and there is a Taxi rank outside the main building if you arrive at this station and need a Taxi.  We did not see any Blue badge parking in the area next to the station however there are car parks near station if the signage was anything to go by There are ladies and gents toilets available there was a notice next to the ladies that said a wheelchair toilet was available to ask staff?. An accessible loo was clearly signposted. Not having the need to use it we didn't take a look so can't really comment further.
blackpool north railway station blackpool,positive,From a public transport perspective and as a wheelchair user travelling with a visually impaired person transport was good. Assistance on and off trains was seamless with help on hand at arrival and departure. An accessible bus service stopped in the station's car park and the service offered a circular route around the town. There were loads of black cab style taxis and many had wheelchair access. Drop of points and short term parking were available in the car park.
blackpool transport service 1516 blackpool,positive,The buses were wheelchair accessible for me as a powerchair user. The driver operated the ramp and in some places this was not required as the kerbs had been raised to be level with the bus entrance. We used a ticket purchased in advance that allowed 7 days (you can get 3 days) unlimited travel on the buses and trams. More information is on the Blackpool Transport website.
blackpool zoo blackpool,negative,"The accessible toilets were functional but not great. The lock was faulty on the one I used in the main building and there weren't obvious signs to tell me about the accessible cubicles in the other toilets. We did not use it, but there is a bus stop at the zoo. There are a few disabled parking spaces near the entrance, but these filled up quickly. My advice is get to the zoo early if parking in a disabled space is important to you. Be warned, everyone pays for parking. When we went everyone had to pay £2.50 to park. There is just the one price for parking & it is for all day. There is a pay machine at the end of the row of disabled parking spaces but it wasn't obvious. I am in two minds about paying for parking. We have got very used to parking for free with the Blue Badge, but signs in the car park say the money is used to care for the animals. I gave 3 out of 5 possible stars because of the parking charge & I didn't feel there were enough disabled parking spaces. Although there was over 400 parking spaces for the zoo, only 12 were accessible parking spaces (3%). These parking spaces needed payment which had to be done at a parking meter that was not suitable for wheelchair users. On speaking to upper management about the lack of provision, the response was that they did not follow government guidelines unless it was legislated. There was an accessible toilet at the entrance and near the cafe, although they didn't have an emergency cord. There was a sign suggesting ""personal care facilities including a hoist"" was available at reception. "
blackpool zoo blackpool,positive,"Parking was excellent with clear signs to find our way and plenty of accessible parking bays. We even visited briefly the day before but didn't have time to go in as we'd come in by bus en route to the model village. The bus stop was around 100m from the entrance and buses were wheelchair accessible. We used the disabled/baby change room at the back of the main cafe. It was roomy, clean & had grab handles. Blue badge users have to pay for parking, although it is only £2 for the day. The spaces were dry roomy and the car park was easy to get around. We parked in the zoos car park. Disabled do have to pay for parking but that was ok as the money helps to support the animals. "
blackwell the arts crafts house windermere,positive,There is free parking on-site and 2 clearly marked Blue Badge parking spaces. The onsite car park surface is tarmac and there are paved areas around the house. There is also a drop-off point by the main entrance. Within the main building there is one accessible toilet and if you are in the tearoom the closet accessible toilet is outside but only 4 meters from the tearoom entrance. Toilets are a decent size also.
blaina wharf public house newport,positive,More than ample parking Didn't use them but were also easily accessed
blair athol distillery pitlochry,positive,"It's within electric wheelchair range of the fully accessible Pitlochry station, albeit there's a couple of difficult narrow bits of pavement  Two fully accessible toilets, one in the bar one in the shop Both Part M"
blair castle caravan park pitlochry,positive,"We walked about 10mins from Blair Atholl Train Station to the site, but you can take your car pretty much everywhere on site. Great, clean and plenty of accessible toilets. "
blair drummond safari park stirling,negative,There was a lot of disabled parking which was very helpful. There was a lot which was handy.
blair drummond safari park stirling,positive,"There was a lot of disabled parking which was very helpful. There was a lot which was handy. We arrived by car as the Safari Park is set a few miles outside of Stirling. We followed the signs, paused at the ticket booth and the headed for the accessible parking area. Plenty of bays and all of them well marked out with ample room to deploy wheelchairs on either side of the vehicle. We thought the location of the accessible parking was also well thought out as it was close to most things and adjacent to the toilets. This is an easy 5 stars as Blair Drummond has a wonderful Changing Places Toilet; as well as accessible toilets. Cannot fault the parking as I wanted to park up near the the Changing Places toilet as my first port of call. Lots of clearly marked accessible parking bays right adjacent to the loos and only a short distance from the cafe and the start of the animal adventures.  What can I say other than 5 stars !!! A fantastic Changing Places Toilet and an additional accessible toilets.  Blair Drummond is near Stirling & easily accessible by car. A lot of the sightseeing  takes place in the car & there is disabled parking spots in the various car parks. There are loo blocks located all around the park - at these there is an accessible toilet. The one we saw was well signposted, spacious & clean."
blair drummond smiddy farm shop stirling,positive,A couple of disabled spaces. Rough ground so bit bumpy in a wheelchair.  Good disabled toilet Parking is good but no oublic transport. Plenty of space in fornt of wide entrance porch. Spacious and clean. I hung a red cord card and left the cord reaching the ground. You would need your own transport.  Large gravel carpark with disabled spaces at the entrance.  The gravel is quite compact so it's quite easy to push a wheelchair over Excellent disabled toilet with plenty of grab rails and a red cord
blakeney quay blakeney,positive,Definitely recommend getting to Blakeney by car - I'm not even sure if there is any public transport nearby. There is a blue badge parking space right on the Quay but parking generally can be tricky if it's busy.
blankenberge blankenberge,positive,"The railway station from Blankenberg takes you all over Belgium and further afield.  Our shuttle was provided by Albion Tours. Modern well equipped buses and a great driver, skilled and patient.  I used the toilet at the pier there is one at the entrance to the pier and one in the Terrace Bar. Adequate for my scooter but not ultra modern. "
blashford lakes nature reserve ellingham,positive,"Parking for disabled is usually left clear by non disabled people outside the education Centre building but I saw no signs saying this was solely for disabled, but I could have parked in up to 5 places along the front of the centre and still leave the doorway clear, I didn't have to use this facility but it looked clean and spacious, there were facilities for all and the rangers were extremely helpful. I could also have accessed the opposite side of Ellingham Drove, for the Ibsley Water lake with Tern Hide and Lapwing hide which requires a Radar key or from the education centre you can ask for the key to open the entrance to the other hides."
blend coffee lounge dundee,negative,"The toilet is huge! Plenty of space to turn and for a carer. However, there is only one toilet for the whole cafe. There isn’t a grab rail at the side of the toilet and there is no red cord or alarm. The floor is always wet because the sink is tiny. About 2 months ago I spoke to the staff about the lack of red cord or replacement grab rails (as there is evidence that there used to be some), they were a bit dismissive but said they ‘d pass it on. I was disappointed on my recent visit that this hadn’t been changed. "
blend coffee lounge dundee,positive,The cafe is in the centre of town near the train station and bus stops. There are car parks nearby but we can usually get parked right outside using the blue badge
blend coffee lounge paisley,positive,"Easy access by bus or train.  Easy to find, grab rails available. Enough room to manoeuvre and for a carer. Clean and tidy. No changing places toilet."
blend coffee lounge perth,positive,"Right outside a bus stop, next to thimblerow car park, disabled parking spots right outside! Fab!"
blenheim palace woodstock,negative,"2 toilets available but not that easy to get to and one was not signposted. Quite small. No mirrors or hooks for coat or handbag. Parking is difficult at Woodstock, but you get the best photos of Blenheim Palace along Park street. Just ask permission at the gate to be allowed to step inside to take a photo. Then drive round to Blenheim Palace main entrance for parking to visit the palace itself. Bladon, and burial place of sir Winston Churchill is a most  difficult place to park, just a few spaces on roadside if fortunate. But most visitors to the church are in and out quiet quickly, so you may be ok."
blenheim palace woodstock,positive,"Went by coach which unloaded right outside but would have needed to drive to access family gardens and butterfly house as cannot be accessed from inside and normal access is by train that I couldn't use. Driving from Midlands, Sat nav is helpful to spot the left turn off the Woodstock Road to the entrance, we might have missed it without that… We had pre booked and QR code was scanned on way into car park, short delay for this, but late morning on a busy Sunday, not surprising - was only a minute or two. There were marshals to help us go the right way, and the route to disabled parking area was very clearly marked, which is quite unusual in our experience! It was a short, flat walk on tarmac surface to the main entrance. You access the toilets from East Courtyard through the shop, they are on the left at the very end, this wasn’t immediately obvious, and it was a little awkward threading through the displays to reach them, though there was actually ample room for Martins rollator… Accessible toilet was roomy, clean, easy to operate lock. Main ladies and gents toilets up a couple of steps, there was a good hand rail though."
bletchley park bletchley,positive,"Plenty of disabled parking spaces near the entrance Plenty of blue badge spaces available near entrance to site Accessible toilets in visitor centre, plenty of other accessible toilets easy to find around the site. All that I used have grab rails and are large enough for a carer and wheelchair if necessary."
blickling estate blickling,positive,"The main car park was spacious and well laid out. There are, however, plenty of disabled spaces at the rear of the main building. They are accessed through an alternative entrance and signs from the main road should be followed. The spaces themselves are near to the main facilities. There were plenty of public toilets available and all of them had a separate disabled cubicles. They were clean, well equipped with grab rails and alarms etc. and we're big enough for wheelchairs to turn (albeit a little cramped.  Hot water freely available."
blists hill victorian town telford,positive,"No problem getting a blue badge space in the large car park on a moderately busy day, but it doesn't look like somewhere that would be good by public transport. Top marks for the loo by the Forest Glen cafe, which had a Euan's Guide card on the emergency cord! I was surprised to see it, because I hadn't found a previous review of Blists Hill on Euan's Guide, but it was great that someone had put it there. Both this loo and another one I visited near the entrance were big enough to get my scooter in, had decent rails and were clean. Plenty of disabled parking right in front of the entrance Disabled toilets are clearly marked on the map"
bloomfield road stadium blackpool,negative,There is a Car park next to the ground with Blue badge spaces available not as there was not a large crowd at this match the car park was almost empty.  The Blackpool Tram system on the prom is about 10mins walk away as is the local bus service  Blackpool South Train Station is also about 10mins walk away There was one wheelchair accessible toilet in the section we were in that while it was basic was useable with normal standard grip rails available.  There was a slight smell from the toilet and the floor was wet but this can some times happen in public toilets
bloomfield road stadium blackpool,positive,The parking at the Blackpool FC stadium was really accessible. The Disabled toilets at Blackpool FC are really big to get into and the room was very spacious.
blue badge parking glasgow,negative,A few facilities in the different parts of town but always in use 
blue beach nice,positive,Directly on the beach. There are a number of accesible buses that stop very close by.
blue fox cafe victoria,negative,"The Blue Fox Café is located on busy Fort Street with parallel pay parking that is not easy to secure. Fortunately buses are passing by frequently and there a stop close by,  "
blue fox cafe victoria,positive,"The bathroom is a little bit tight to get to,  but once inside is of adequate size  for a person using a scooter or small wheelchair with an attendant.  It was also clean and tidy."
blue planet aquarium cheshire oaks,negative,"Small but adequate disabled toilet, difficult to fit 2carers and child in wheelchair in without setting the hand drier off! No changing place."
blue planet aquarium cheshire oaks,positive,"Toilets were easy to find as there are signs, there are 3 altogether. The disabled toilets have plenty of turning space in them with grab rails and room for a carer. Plenty of close disabled parking spots"
blue sakura leeds,negative,"I believe they are located towards the back of the restaurant, but I did t use it so can't say for certain."
bluebell cottage chipping sodbury,positive,Parking a very short distance from accommodation. 
bluebell croft luxury self catering anaheilt,positive,"You can park your car right next to the cottage.  There is shingle which can cause a problem with the wheelchair, but with a bit of manoeuvring you can park right next to the flagstone pathway.  Bluebell Croft is about a mile from the village of Strontian with no transport facilities to the Croft.  Although the drive is steep, it is doable with the electric wheelchair and you can walk/wheel into the village. There was plenty of space to turn in the shower room to use the toilet, although you would have to close the door to the bedroom. (There is another door through to the kitchen).  The slightly sunken roll-in shower may hinder  manoeuvrability, but once you have got used to the slight dip it presented no problem.  There is a drop down handle and a wall bar. The parking is in front of the property on the gravel forecourt.  The owners were happy to clear a path for us which made access much easier.  The ensuite loo is great.  A true wetroom with enough space for a mobile hoist.  Excellent.  Although the drive is gravel, there is a hard standing area to park the wheelchair accessible vehicle next to which leads to the cottage door. Excellent Huge wet floor shower area with grab rails and seat riser on loo. There is a bathroom in the downstairs area which is good for disabled individuals."
bluebell railway uckfield,positive,They always make sure there are blue badge spaces but the better stations for this are Sheffield park and east grinstead  (although I've never parked at east grinstead). Horstead Keynes always allow for disabled passengers but these are just an area for disabled only parking not marked bays. There are a couple of carriages with a lift from platform to train and kitted out with space for wheelchairs and fold up chairs for your family to sit with you and enjoy the views. It is worth phoning ahead to make sure you can catch these trains to make the most of your visit.  I have only used the loo at Sheffield Park in the Bessemer arms but that was fine. Parked approx ten metres from the entrance in an accessible bay. Hashtag lines to the side and rear for safe vehicle entrance/exit. (East Grinstead). At East Grinstead (by the diner static coach) is an accessible toilet that meets building regulations. An additional accessible toilet with high seat is the only toilet on the platform that also serves everyone else. Toilets also signposted in the pub on the Sheffield Park platform.
bluewater dartford,negative,"There are plenty of accessible toilets. However, I've yet to find one that I would describe as excellent. The toilet I used on this occasion was combined with a baby-change table. I couldn't reverse past the folded table into the wheelchair space as it was in the space, sticking out 8"" from the wall. Most other toilets have a sanitary bin blocking the space.  I haven't tried the ""High Dependency Unit"" (assuming this to be a ""Changing Places"" toilet) as you have to phone up centre management or go to the upper level concierge desk to request access. The HDU is on the lower level."
bluewater dartford,positive,"If on approach to Bluewater you follow the signs to the Mobility Parking area you will find a large flat parking zone with very easy access into Bluewater .  In fact you enter by the Mobility shop where there are scooters and wheelchairs available.   You are now on the ground floor of the triangular shaped mall with plenty of lifts available to take you to the 1st floor . I used my local bus and, of course, all buses now need to be fully accessible so no fault there. Passing a car park on my way in, I noticed a section dedicated to Blue Badge holders, clearly marked with plenty of room to open doors, having wide cross-hatching at alternate sides of the bays."
boardwalk falkirk,positive,"Large car park, with three spaces reserved for disabled customers. Very accessible restaurant."
boath doocot nairn,negative,You can park at the foot of the hill. A signpost takes you from the village's Main Street and along a track. The grass either side and the rough surface leaves you wondering if this is the right way to be going. Getting to the end of the track you turn in to a spacious rough gravelled car park where a reassuring sign announces the story of Boath Doocot.
bod bournemouth bournemouth,positive,"Private off road parking right at the front door, with no step or lip into the sun room or hallway. Buses are a level walk to Southbourne Grove which is about 5 or 10 minutes away The en-suite wet room to the front bedroom is huge, loads of space. We have used the rear bedroom which has a smaller en-suite wet room but is very useable for the disabled person and a carer"
bodeans london,negative,"Balham Railway Station is nearby and has a lift - very accessible for wheelchair users. Balham Tube Station is nearby and is totally INaccessible for wheelchair users. The accessible toilet would have got five stars, but the red emergency cord is set in a corner of the ceiling, out of reach of anyone who might need it, and what's more it had been tucked behind a bin. Very thoughtless."
bodega edinburgh,negative,Parking on Leith Walk and side streets. Taxi can park right outside. Loads of buses to Albert Place.
bodega edinburgh,positive,Accessible loo with grab rails and loads of room.  Curious placement of the hand dryer on the opposite wall from the sink - your hands will have dripped on everything by the time you get there. Not really very practical.
bodenham arboretum kidderminster,positive,"At all points of this trip, parking was easy enough, free in the woods, and as we did not stop to visit the Arboretum, that to was free for us, normally the price of parking would be included with your entrance fee, as it will be if you visit the Safari park."
bodlon cardiff,negative,No parking and on road parking is a nightmare. Very close to a bus stop.
bodlon cardiff,positive,Large enough for a carer. Rails but no adult sized changing place. Once inside the loo is fine. No adult sized changing facilities but very few places have these.
bodmin jail attraction bodmin,positive,"There is a carpark 300 years away, This is pay and display (even for blue badge holders) but it is flat, no gravel, and there are plenty of accessible spaces.   There is a hill to negotiate between the attraction and the carpark. You can be dropped off at the gates of the jail, and a pre-bookable shuttle is available between the carpark and the attraction.  Large with vertical and horizontal grab rails. "
bodmin town museum bodmin,positive,Adjacent public carpark
bodnant garden colwyn bay,negative,"When you enter the car park the disabled spaces are on the left However you have to park side on to a steep hill, so it's very difficult to open and hold the door not least because the spaces are small"
bologna centrale railway station bologna,positive,"From Bologna Marconi Airport we took the 15 min bus journey €4 direct to the Centrali Train Station, this bus was wheelchair accessible, single deck every 15 mins. The access points were all on the same level, as with arrival. There was very clear signage, direction markers, cobbled guidance and staff available for info and support. The bus stops at the Airport, Bus and Rail Stations we’re fully dedicated stops. 10 meters from the entrances. Did not use, but there was very clear and visible signage and directions to what they described as accessible toilets. One of Group said they were fully equipped and well serviced. Again, all British Railways take note."
bolster moor farmshop huddersfield,negative,"Disable parking spots provided near the café and if front of the shop, large car park with plenty of spots available and tarmacked so that the car park provided easier accessibility, however car park is slightly sloped which may present some problems as it is quite steep. "
bolster moor farmshop huddersfield,positive,"Best accessed by car but there is a bus route. Disabled parking is outside farm shop and could do with some outside cafe, but very short distance between the two. Next to main toilets in cafe. Plenty of space to manouvere , grab rails and pull card. Always very clean. Accessible loo available in café, clear sign posting provided and a spacious clean tidy bathroom with handrails and room for a carer. "
bolton abbey skipton,negative,I presume there was an accessible loo but I didn't see one.
bolton abbey skipton,positive,"The bathroom was spacious and accessed using a radar key, but lacks a full changing station. When my family and I go to Bolton Abbey, we tend to drive every time, so my knowledge of public transport around this area is limited. However, when we do drive, we are able to park very near to the information/welcome area in one of the blue badge parking spaces. The accessible toilets were superb! Plenty of room to manouvere the wheelchair and a well positioned handrail next to the toilet. If necessary, a carer could go into the toilet with you, but I didn't have a carer with me. The facilities were always clean and there has always been toilet roll when I've used the toilet. We could park directly next to it - not on the official car parks."
bolton town centre bolton,negative,"Not very much disabled parking available in the town centre, there are some multi-storeys but not all of these are suitable for wheelchair vans.  Bus station at the moment has very bad pavementing, dropped kerbs are not lowered enough in some places and steep slopes. Hopefully this won't be a problem when they build the new one! There are not really very many of these considering the size of the town centre.  These are the ones I know of: There is one in M&S (not locked), there is one in the Health Centre on Ashburner street (not locked), two in the Market place shopping centre one of which has a RADAR lock.  There is a changing places facility at Bolton One which is a bit of a trek from the shops if you're desperate."
bolton town centre bolton,positive,"There is a lot of disabled parking in and around the town centre. In front of the library, outside the theatre and in the pay car park. The service on our local buses is the best as I have never had any problems getting on or off. We also have a free bus that does a circuit route around town."
bonds lifestyle stratford upon avon,positive,"It’s just 3.5 miles out of Stratford apon Avon, and we parked to the right of entering property, with just two parking bays, but other bays available as well.  The disabled toilet was spotlessly clean, roomy and may be easy enough to spin around in. The passage to reach it may be tight for powerchair though, so you will need to pick your route carefully. There are grab rails and pull cord."
boness waterfront boness,positive,Parking in the car park alongside the railway line and opposite the bus station. This is a short distance from the Railway carpark. Access to the fully tarmac path is across the gated railway line and is easy enough. There are at the time of writing two disabled spaces. 
bonkers st andrews,negative,There is limited on street parking near by
bonmarche paisley,positive,Parking on level one of car park
bonzo lounge keynsham,positive,The restaurant is situated in the new civic centre and the disabled parking is under cover and a straight through walk to the restaurant Very clean and tidy. It was also used as a baby changing station
book cycle orrell,negative,"The nearest bus stops are very close, and drivers will probably put down a disabled ramp for you. Parking is either on the street to the side or a very unkempt car park to the side with deep potholes and generally uneven ground which would be terrible for a wheelchair or walker. Disabled loos impossible to access using most wheelchairs or walkers or similar - due to shelving and boxes lining the corridor on the way. Not signposted. The disabled loo is also the ladies. Generally clean, but very little loo roll and no sanitary waste disposal services. Cord was tied up, and I'm not certain it is still in operation."
booths ripon,negative,"I reached Booths on my scooter and therefore did not need to park. From what I could see - there are 5 disabled bays either side of the main entrance - they are part of the pay-and-display car park directly outside the main entrance. The fee is low (60p for the 1st hour, I think) and begins after 30 minutes."
booths ripon,positive,"The disabled toilet was spacious, very clean and easy to find.  There was a sufficient number of grab rails, a low sink and a mirror! A Euan's Guide card now adorns the red emergency cord."
boots bristol,negative,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately 200m away on Station Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
boots derby,negative,Parking bay is worn.  There is now a wheelchair accessible bridge accessible  from Chaddesden. Nearest bus for I have to go via town. 
boots edinburgh,negative,Accessible parking in the centre but a distance away.
boots edinburgh,positive,"Disabled space right beside front door Basic but fine This is a main route southbound out of the City so is well provided by Lothian Buses, parking is ample with limited standing time available, be aware between 15.45 and 18.00 there parking restrictions on this road."
boots forres,positive,"Free parking with disabled bays very close - behind the High Street, so very accessible.  Some on street parking also. "
boots horsham,positive,"The parking doesn't belong to the store, but the disabled parking for the shopping centre is excellent, with numerous dedicated spaces out the front (close to the store), and also a large number of dedicated spaces in the attached multi-story car park"
boots london,negative,"The nearest step-free station is Earls Court, which is a long way off. The 49 bus stops just outside this branch of Boots, and the 74 bus is not very far away. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area."
boots opticians bristol,negative,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest to Boots Opticians is the Council owned parking approximately 200m away on Mizzymead Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
boots york,negative,Didn't see any signs around identifying the disabled toilet. Staff member advised me that there was one at the back of the store and that a key from a member of staff was required to access this. Staff member wasn't sure whether or not there was an alarm cord. Didn't view the actual toilet so unable to comment on the spacing etc.
born in the borders jedburgh,positive,"The toilet was clean and with a clear transfer space. I’ve taken a mark off as the red cord did not reach the floor, this could also be easily fixed."
borough briggs elgin,positive,"I didn't use a car park on this occasion, I used my scooter to get to the stadium, but I have drove to the stadium before and I know that there is a car park opposite Borough Briggs with disabled parking spaces. You can also park in a car park behind Borough Briggs and there is also a large Tesco car park 5 minutes from the stadium. Elgin train station is about a mile from Borough Briggs and should take about 15 minutes to walk. As you leave the train station turn left and continue to walk up a steep hill. Keep going straight on this road crossing two roundabouts and at the third roundabout turn left. Go up this road for about 500 yards and then you should see the ground on your left hand side. "
borough market london,negative,"They have a good, big toilet with grab rails but filthy and smelly. The market is close to London Bridge station, which has one step-free entrance on Tooley Street. If you're going with able-bodied people, it takes you a long way out of your way. The safest option from there is to cross Tooley Street and go under London Bridge and by road to the market. The pavements don't have enough dropped kerbs to make them easily navigable, but the roads are quiet enough to wheel down. The roads to the market have cobbles and potholes, but there is level access all the way to the market. Going up and over London Bridge is a long push uphill."
borough market london,positive,"There are disabled parking spaces in jubilee street and park street just outside the market. We found one without any problem. I haven't tried london buses or the tube in my wheelchair but both stop nearby. Arriving by tube from London Bridge I found it fairly easy to get to with short walk from the station into Borough High Street and then into the Market. There's a covered passage way on the far side of the street that takes you from the High Street into the market area. It does have a bit of a slope downward so you can avoid that by going a few metres further down the High Street where you go in via the Market Hall - a glass looking building with loads of seats, plants and an accessible loo. There is a accessible toilet in the Market Hall that's next door to the conventional loos. It's tucked away so it's best to go into the middle of the hall and look back toward the market and you will see it on the right. It's a long and narrow layout so for some wheelchair users it may well mean wheeling in and reversing out. It's well provisioned and modern and clean."
borrowash post office derby,positive,Indigo & i4 stops right outside.   There is a car park but I've never used it.
boschetto garden corfu,positive,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced.
boston tea party cheltenham,negative,"No parking attached to Boston Tea Party, but is in Cheltenham town centre so there are a number of parking options close by. It is situated on the same road as the central town bus stops."
boston tea party cheltenham,positive,The disabled access toilet was easy to find and clearly signed. It large enough for a wheelchair user and a carer. It was clean and there were grab rails. 
bosworth water park nuneaton,negative,"There was 3 disabled parking spaces, not very wide like normal disabled spaces, just normal spaces marked out with the wheelchair logo. They weren't close to anything We couldn't find the accessible loo. Needing the toilet for me means I have to go right away and it not being signposted I had to go into the womens toilets, I had to get my daughter to stand at the door because once you are in the cubicle there is no room to shut the door"
botanic garden durham,negative,"If driving there are 7 disabled parking spaces, car park area is graveled, then this leads on to a paved path leading to entrance. If using public transport you need to access the Bishop Auckland bus from Durham City and ask (for ""Colleges"" or ""Hollingside Lane""), then there is a 5 minute walk from the bus stop,this is all up hill with no paths. Toilets at main entrance however these are the only toilets in the grounds . Toilets were clean had grab rails with emergency pull cord. Sink was low but coat hook was high on the door. The disabled toilets were shared with baby changing unit and changing bins, so this made it quite compact and 2 people may struggle  once inside."
botanical garden puerto de la cruz,negative,"There are 2 ""accesssible toilets"" one in the men's and the other in the ladies toilets. To be honest they are not fit to be called accessible toilets.  I noticed a metal gate with a wheelchair user sign. The gate had to be unbolted and it was heavy. I went threw thinking it would be obvious where the accessible toilet was. When I followed this step free path it appeared to lead to a private admin block and it was not clear where to go. I think in hindsight I should have turned right at the end of the path to get to the toilets, but as it wasnt sign posted I retraced my steps.   I then followed the sign to the toilets. There was a single step to negosiate and then a short flight of stairs with a handrail on one side.  I used the accessible toilet in the ladies. The door to the ladies was open and the accessible toilet immediately in front with a wheelchair user logo on the door. the toilet itself was clean and spacious but there were NO grab rails. I nearly found myself stuck on the toilet and I found this distressing. This was unacceptable."
botanical garden puerto de la cruz,positive,"The Botanical gardens are located in the La Paz area of Puerto de la Cruz, a suburb. Buses stop near by. Taxis are relatively inexpensive and you can be dropped off at the entrance."
botanischer garten und botanisches museum berlin berlin,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Bus M48 from Alexanderplatz drops you right by the eastern gate and runs every 10 minutes. The western (Dahlem) gate is also on a bus route. There is an S-bahn station (Line 1) called Botanischer Garten which is wheelchair accessible, but is probably 15 minutes wheel/walk from the garden. There are three, of which we experienced two, one of which was in the restaurant (see separate review). The attendant at the ticket desk in the museum was very helpful and fetched the key for us from the porter's office. The loo was spacious & clean with sensible grab rails and alarm button which could be reached from the floor."
bothwell services glasgow metropolitan area,negative,There are two Blue badge spaces these are right next to the main services building about 15 to 20 meters this might be a small number but not bad for the size of the station its self  You need to pick up the key from the cash desk in the shop if you want to use this toilet it is not a radar key. The key is on a very large metal key ring that is made not to fit in your pocket . It is good basic wheelchair toilet located next to the other toilets and was well sign posted as you entered main door there is also a very quick right hand turn to get to the door. The light comes on automatically as you enter the toilet  
boundary park oldham,negative,"Boundary park has disabled parking spaces outside the home stand and the club website says there are 40 blue badge parking spaces for home and away supporters that do not need to be pre-booked. However the car park is on slightly uneven ground for a the tail lift so we went to the B&Q a couple of minutes walk from the ground and they kindly let us park there for the duration of the match. The only positive about the toilets is that there is a disabled toilet. It is a nightmare to get to in the Zen Office Stand. It is at the other side of the concourse from where the disabled seats are and can only be accessed by moving through all other supporters. You have to push your way into the gender specific toilet meaning your carer must be the same gender. In the men’s toilet there is one tiny, dirty accessible toilet in the far corner, which is nearly impossible to get to and when I got there I found a drunken man asleep in the toilet. It was awful..."
bournemouth pavillion bournemouth,negative,"A disabled toilet is located in the main foyer There is also a similar facility located on the the Mezzanine level, the level below the Ballroom. This toilet is accessible via the lift and located near to the Lucullus Room but we've never actually used these toilets."
bow lane dublin,positive,"A ten minute walk from the luas, not much nearby parking."
bowlplex renfrew,positive,"Was pleased to see that, despite accidentally falling foul of parking rules, braehead have monitored car parking. Improper use of disabled bays carries a fine. Parking is fine. Toilets to the left as you enter the venue Plenty if accessible parking bays all around the front of the building. Plenty of space and conveniently placed handrails. *note the toilets are accessed using a radar key*"
bq arbroath,positive,"This B&Q store is situated in a retail park with other stores so there is plenty of parking spaces and we counted around 15 disabled parking spaces, not including 2 that were sectioned off so that people can queue outside.  I'm not sure about the public transport in this area but I'd say the center or Arbroath is about a 15-minute walk away where there are probably bus stops than connect to other towns in Angus and Dundee."
bq dudley,positive,Plenty of disabled parking spaces close to the entrance.
bq exeter,positive,A good number of accessible spaces near the front of the store.
bq poole,positive,"Car parking for disabled persons is excellent. It is also monitored, so if you see an offender parking without a Blue Badge just let the chap who greets all shoppers know and he'll get the security guard to have a quiet word. Clean and easy to use. You will occasionally find members of staff use this toilet (remember not all disabilities are visible)."
bradgate park trust leicester,negative,There is two car parks Newtown Linford and Hallgate both have disabled spaces close to the park entrance. The car park charge is £4.00 for the whole day.
bradgate park trust leicester,positive,"There is a disabled toilet at the Newtown Linford car park that has a radar key, to access this there is a short 2 minute walk to the conservatory tea room that the staff will give you the key. This toilet has a hoist, bed and hand rails that cater for all needs and can easily manover a wheelchair in and out of the toilet, all accessible by a ramp."
brading roman villa sandown,positive,"Very difficult to access by public transport involving a walk uphill on narrow roads from the bus stop on the main road. Own transport thoroughly recommended. Large car park with 3 dedicated disabled parking spaces near the entrance, although there are no markings on any spaces so parking is easy  One Accessible toilet Plenty of handrails Space to turn a wheelchair Alarm call bell Doubles up as baby change area "
brae hotel shetland,positive,The toilet was easy to find. The toilet was large with enough room for my wheelchair to manoeuvre easily. There was also plenty of room for a carer if needed. There was ample grab rails but no emergency cord. Toilet was clean & tidy.
braehead arena glasgow,negative,"Have only ever travelled by car to Braehead. There are large (free) car parks, though these can still get quite busy, particularly at weekends.  There are many marked disabled bays, and their own security/parking team do inspect that these are used by blue-badge holders only.  There are buses to Braehead, but getting there by public transport could take a bit of planning. No trains go there.  I have only rated the toilets at 1 because i  know their is  one in the foyer but i haven't used it."
braehead arena glasgow,positive,"We didn't use them but there are accessible toilets. Braehead shopping centre does also have a changing places toilet.. Which is why I've given it a high score The disabled parking is good at Braehead. You use their car park with plenty on the upper level, the lower level aswell as in the multi-storey"
braintree garden centre braintree,negative,"Has it’s own car park with a few disabled bays. The car park is only small however I have visited many a times and never struggled to access a disabled bay.   I don’t know if you can access from public transport but it is near Braintree Designer Village which is near a train station and bus stop. It is very close to a busy road and round about and would not think it is safe to walk from these public transport locations  The toilet is ok, enough room for a manual chair but I think it could be potentially awkward with something large. There were grab rails.   Not sure if there was a Changing Places Toilet "
bramall lane sheffield,negative,Regulars can buy a space. Otherwise there is very limited double yellow line parking.
bramall lane sheffield,positive,"Good toilets, plenty of space, not always clean and tidy!"
brambles inveraray,negative,"There is no no designated parking for Brambles itself. However, nearby, there are a number of Blue Badge designated spaces, which are adjacent to the main thoroughfare. For non Blue Badge holders free (off season) parking (paid Mar-Nov) are available on Main Street or The Avenue. Holiday weekends and the summer season can be especially busy with cars, touring buses and bikers.  The nearest railway station is 17 miles away at Dalmally. For bus info and contact details see http://www.westcoastmotors.co.uk/"
brambles inveraray,positive,"The loo's are on first sight, hidden away, but are in an alcove corner at the opposite end of the restaurant area from the main entrance. Signage is limited but passage to the toilet area is accessible and staff point you in the right direction. In a manual wheelchair, I found the facilities to be accessible, well equipped, and clean. Check with a member of staff on arrival for advice specific to your own requirements. "
bramwood holiday home ltd swansea,negative,Not enough room for me!
bramwood holiday home ltd swansea,positive,"The property itself is on a hill, but the garage is totally flat and transferring from a car parked in it was not a problem. Again, set up specifically for another individual, but a very high standard and quite adaptable. large parking area for 2-3 cars, bit of a slope. There are buses from Swansea occasionally! Hoist system in accessible bedroom. electric flushing toilet Steep drive but plenty of space. "
branksome chine poole,negative,"This beach is easy to drive to, and there are plenty of blue badge parking spaces. The parking area is set on concrete, so if you are in a wheelchair and you can't get one of these blue badge spaces, it is a clear, easy route to the beach."
brantano poole,positive,Fantastic. Not monitored but spaces right outside the door.
brasserie blanc cheltenham,positive,Room to move in the accessible toilet with good grab rails.
brasserie zedel london,positive,"Green Park tube station is about half a mile away and is fully step-free, served by Victoria, Jubilee and Piccadilly Lines. A very agreeable accessible toilet in the basement, with everything just as it should be. The paper towels are exceptionally strong and butch. I travelled by Tube (Jubilee Line) from London Bridge to Green Park. About 10/15 minutes wheel from Green Park Station to Brasserie Zedel. Green Park Station is wheelchair accessible but it requires 3 lifts from the platform to street level so you should always contact London TFL to confirm the lifts are in a working order prior to making the trip.  Clean accessible toilet but red cord not to the ground - see photos"
brawn london,positive,There is a disabled toilet. However the corridor to the toilet is quite narrow and the disabled toilet is typically used to store many other items that may need to be removed so that you can get in!
braywick leisure centre maidenhead,positive,"There are lots of slots available for disabled people in the car park. I went inside some of them once, and I noticed how big they were, they had everything you'd need."
bread meats bread edinburgh,negative,"Did not use, hence mid range"
breakout games aberdeen aberdeen,positive,We parked in the nearby shopping centre carpark. Great disabled toilet in the reception area
brechin castle garden centre brechin,positive,"Due to not not being from Brechin I don’t know anything about the public transport nerby however,there are plenty of disabled blue badge parking spaces available beside the entrance of Brechin Castle Garden Centre. I’d say about 7 or 8 parking spaces in total. I’m not sure how many accessible toilets there are but I saw one just across from the food court area. It was beside the the male and female toilets.  The accessible toilet was a decent size and a wheelchair user and someone to assist them would be able to fit in however, if you need to transfer from the left side of the toilet you would struggle as the toilet is closer to the wall at that side. See photo below. Also I didn’t see an emergency red cord hanging down and there was a big black bin in the accessible toilet taking up a lot of space, a smaller bin would make it easier for customers to move around and transfer from the right side of the toilet if they needed to."
breckland lodge attleborough,positive,"There is a large car park as there is a hotel on site, a bistro , a cafe and a bar and restaurant. There are very limited disabled spaces though . The whole car park is tarmac."
breezy knees gardens york,negative,"There is an accessible loo, although this was a little tight for the scooter I was using which is 50cm wide - just managed to manoeuvre in.  I don't think public transport would have been an option.  There was a lot of parking but I didn't see any allocated disabled spaces"
breezy knees gardens york,positive,"Plenty of parking, with spaces reserved for blue Badge holders - perhaps not the widest of spaces, we were a little cramped on returning to the car. Surface is loose gravel. A wheelchair user could be dropped off where the tarmac path starts if the gravel is problematic."
bressingham steam and gardens bressingham,positive,"There are disabled spaces but they do fill up quite quickly so an early start is recommended. It’s not tarmac , more stone but the scooter coped well.  There is a disabled toilet. The toilets were clean and accessible.  There is a raised toilet and grab bars. "
brew 74 glasgow,positive,Easy to access and large enough.clean and all hand rails.
brewdog dundee,positive,Don’t know about parking Asia’s in my wheelchair & others were walking.
brewdog edinburgh,negative,There didn’t appear to be any dedicated parking for this venue nearby. The closest parking would be Castle Terrace NCP car park or street parking on Cambridge Street by the Usherhall/Traverse Theatre. 
brewdog edinburgh,positive,The accessible loo is on the left hand side of the downstairs area of the bar. It is a decent size with a cord down to the floor and a fold out baby changing table. It appeared pretty clean and there would be room for a carer. 
brewdog sheffield,negative,In the City Centre so accessible via bus or tram. Some on street parking but limited and in a very busy area.
brewdog sheffield,positive,Disabled toilet in wide corridor with sliding door. Large toilet with the usual commercial set up.
brewers fayre bankhead gate glenrothes,positive,"Disabled parking bay is directly in front of entrance. If there is a rarity that it is full you are able to park next to Brewer's Fayre, into the Premier Inn disabled parking bay. Accessible. Easy to find although can ask a member of staff as they are always happy to help. Clean. Rails."
brewers fayre norwich,negative,There are a couple of disabled spaces how ever not many. These are located at the front of the restaurant. There is a bus stop a road away from this restaurant however it does have a steep incline from the bus stop up to the restaurant. 
brewers fayre norwich,positive,There's a disabled toilet located at the front near the entrance of the restaurant. 
brewhemia edinburgh,positive,"Across the road from Edinburgh Waverley Train Station and nearby  on street parking. The accessible toilet is hug! It is a large room with few bins, I could do circles with my chair and not bump into anything! Right opposite the Market Street entrance to Waverley station, Parking available on Market Street. Taxi can drop off in layby beside entrance.  Just across from where the lift lets you out on the lower level. Code needed for door, Members of staff happy to assist. Plenty of room inside."
brgr edinburgh,positive,"Got the buses, Lothian buses I know off that go by, 7, 8, 14, 49. Separate accessible loo."
brickhouse cottages hambleton,positive,"The Main Bedroom with en-suite wet-room (probably the best I can recall, always hot water, surfaces to accommodate toiletries etc. (a major fault I find in holiday wet rooms) Parking is close to the cottages , just outside or at the end of the row depending on which one you are staying in. It feels very safe. The road is compacted gravel. Tarmac would be better , and I believe that is planned in future. Huge accessible shower room.  The Brickhouse Farm Cottages are accessible by car and there is ample parking on the site and in particular within close proximity to each cottage.  Fully accessible loo. Good size with hoist etc.  Flat, level access tarmac car park where you can park right outside your cottage. Lots of room and is private with no public access. Bedrooms downstairs with en-suite wet room with commode and shower chair readily provided.  Mobile hoist readily available to hire for  £50 for the five days. Electric beds readily provided and en-suites in all bedrooms. Two allocated parking spaces, perfect  Plenty of space for parking on hard standing outside the cottages. All the cottages have accessible toilets. in the cottage in which we stayed there were two accessible ground floor toilets in the en suite wet room or shower room attached to the two bedrooms; one was raised, and both had rails and space for side transfer. A nice big wetroom with bags of space."
bricks restaurant cranleigh,negative,"Parking area as you enter the site - don't go into the car park on the left, look to the right by first retail units where there's a small sign saying 'no parking, deliveries or blue badge only'.  There's only room for two cars here, badly marked, no spaces if there's a lorry already there. No dropped kerb.  So not great! "
bricks restaurant cranleigh,positive,"Lovely radar key operated loo about twenty metres away.  Is for whole site and obviously you need to exit cafe to visit it, hence point deducted."
bridge coffee bolton,positive,There is a clean toilet which is wheelchair friendly. It has grab rails and an alarm cord accessible. 
bridge of cally hotel blairgowrie,negative,We drove here parking was in a car park  across the road from the hotel.this is rural area so not too much traffic but some cars were a bit fast so be careful crossing the road. I went to the disabled public toilet which was adequate.
bridge of orchy hotel argyll,positive,There is car parking next door to the hotel - didn't see any specific blue badge spaces. You can drop off right outside the door of the hotel - you can also drop off right outside the accessible cottage. Great! Spacious and clean
bridge theatre london,positive,Toilet was ok but but tricky if on your own.  The door is right next to the ladies toilet and my opening the door nearly caused an accident. But they do offer a free carer ticket so usually I would not be on my own and a carer would be there to avoid a crash!
bridgemere nursery garden world nantwich,positive,"The first thing that was really noticeable was the size of the carpark, huge, and there were plenty of disabled spaces.  Some of the spaces were near to the entrance/exit.  The ground was my first easy to wheel on surface of the day.    There is a large car park just for disabled people near the main entrance, I'd guess 20 spaces additionally there are more spaces in the main car park which number 20 also A bit tight to get into."
brigg garden centre brigg,negative,Not many blue badge parking spaces and when we got there all the spaces where taken so it made it problematic for getting me and my wheelchair in and out of the car. We did mention this to customer services and suggested having more accessible parking spaces especially as the car park is very big. If you don't have a blue parking badge there is some nearer spaces to the entrance but these are usually taken up first so there may be a bit of a walk to the entrance.
brigg garden centre brigg,positive,"There are two toilets, one close to the exit and the other in the restaurant. Plenty of room to get to them and inside of the toilets. For such a big place they could do with more toilets dotted around. The accessible toilets were clean and spacious and had enough room to fit my care and my wheelchair in and there was enough grab rails. Enough room to manoeuvre my wheelchair around in."
brighton centre brighton,negative,"I could not access the  up stairs disabled toilet due to the non use of radar key and the member of staff on that floor not having a key, and was told to go down to the ground floor lost property point.  the ground floor disabled toilet if you can find it (signs where not easy to understand/ poorly positioned, this toilet was a well equipped room for all Disabilities, very clean and spacious. We arrived by minibus and although there was no allocated disabled parking nearby we were able to pull in and drop our group off at the back entrance of the venue. The toilet facilities were fine for our group."
brighton centre brighton,positive,"With a blue badge you are able to park in front of the venue.   BUT although there is adequate parking at the nearby carparks they are very expensive Large enough for a powerchair As mentioned we parked on double yellow lines with the blue badge on West Street, but if we had entered West Street from Kings Road then we could have driven into The Mall car park without a problem.  By driving to the lowest level to park one would only have to cross the road into The Centre. Please see in my review"
brighton dome and brighton festival brighton,positive,"Parking outside or up the road in a car park  We went by wheelchair taxi, which parked directly outside"
bristol airport bristol,positive,"Fairly easy to find.  Grab rails, clean and tidy.  However, the one upstairs in the secure area, adjacent to the Assistance Office was out of order. (nearby toilets if you could walk) They have a easy drop off point for those who have mobility issues with a covered walkway. The meet and greet parking was excellent. We stayed at the on site hotel and booked an accessible room with only one nights notice. A steep incline to get to the terminal though is the only issue. Good and clean. two in baggage reclaim. One right by the access waiting area in departures. Large enough for carer as well."
bristol old vic bristol,positive,"I travelled by public transport. From Bristol Meads train station I got a bus (70 or 73) outside the station which took me to The Centre"" an area with a number of bus stops, and from there it was about a 3 minute walk to theatre. The accessible toilet was on a different floor from the bar and dress circle when I visited. I was able to use the lift to reach it. The accessible toilet was huge and had a step free accessible shower. There were emergency cords at the toilet and shower area. It was clean and tidy. "
britannia spice ocean drive,negative,"Although I did not use it, there is an accessible toilet in the restaurant."
britannia view restaurant edinburgh,negative,There are toilets but no accessible ones within the restaurant. Visitors can use the shopping centres accessible toilets but they are some distance away.
britannia view restaurant edinburgh,positive,You can park in the disabled bays in the nearby multi story car park. A short walk from the bays takes you to the dual lifts where you can travel to all floors of the shopping centre. A dedicated bus stop outside the centre's main entrance provides regular accessible buses into the city centre.
britannia walk edinburgh,negative,Accessible toilets are available in the adjacent Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre.
britannia walk edinburgh,positive,Parking is right next door if you can get a space. There are some dedicated Blue Badge bays.
british airways i360 brighton,negative,"For such a modern attraction I was disappointed to find such a tiny accessible toilet once you are through security. It is very narrow and the same size as the other toilets. The sink was also tiny and the flushes are located behind the toilet which could be quite hard to reach. It is also worth mentioning that there aren't any toilets once you are in the viewing pod. The toilet near the entrance is bigger and I'd recommend going here before you go through security, although the design of this toilet is still not great. The flush is on the wrong side, the red emergency cord is tied up out of reach and there were bins in the transfer area. No parking at the venue, although there is street parking nearby, but can be busy during the season. There are car parks in the area, but can't comment on how accessible they are. "
british airways i360 brighton,positive,We walked here but there are bus stops nearby. The Brighton and Hove buses have lots of accessible features which make them a good option for getting around the area. Disabled loo easily accessible with grab rails & emergency pull cord. 
british heart foundation furniture shop edinburgh,negative,Shopping centre has car park with disabled spaces but is some distance away. Bus stops close by.
british motor museum gaydon,positive,"All parking is outdoors with level access to the entrance, however when we went the signposting was not very clear and we couldn't really tell where we were supposed to go for the blue badge/accessible spaces or for ""museum"" vs ""conference centre"". Many disabled slots all on the fkat Good size well laid out On the flat, outside (so no height restrictions) of the main entrance to the Museum and around the side for Conference facilities. Disabled toilet is on restaurant level - accessible via Museum by the lifts. Dedicated disabled parking with direct flat access."
british museum london,negative,"There are bus stops & taxi ranks nearby, but accessible tube stations are further away. There are only two disabled toilets for the whole building (plus one in the learning centre). These are both on the ground floor and we'll sign posted. Both toilets are large with non touch flush and automatic tap. Dryer and hand towel available. Not too clean so only 3 stars. No disabled toilets by main restaurant or gallery cafe. The disabled toilets I used were adequate for space and facilities - grab handles etc. Unfortunately I didn't see a disabled toilet with hoist or showering facilities. The toilets I used on the day were quite grubby and would have benefited from a good clean. The nearest step-free stations are King's Cross and Green Park, both very far away. A few bus routes will drop you nearby in New Oxford St, just a block away. There are not enough accessible toilets. They are ridiculously over-subscribed, and they are often disgustingly messy, with wet floor and bits of wet bogroll scattered around. Ugh. The red emergency cords do not all have the usual triangular plastic attachment, so they are very hard to grab hold of in an emergency, and they're often tied up out of reach. See my attached pics. The cleaners' activity/inspection logs on the toilet walls are often left unsigned/uninitialled for a whole week."
british museum london,positive,"Accessible toilets can be found on all floors. They are clean, spacious, and provide excellent grab rails. I am not aware if any have full changing facilities or not. A very busy part of London so parking may be challenging.  You can contact the museum to make parking arrangements if you are a disabled visitor. Good facilities, modern, clean and spacious. All well signposted and easy to find. Drove from Wiltshire straight to the main entrance of the museum and was immediately shown to the disabled parking area right in front of the museum.  Nothing could have been easier! Honestly the parking was amazing! We parked right on the forecourt with the British Museum building next to us. They opened these gates that I have been through lots of times but have never seen opened before. We parked right outside.  You do need to organise parking in advance but this is easily done on the museum’s website.  NB The museum is having some temporary work (it wasn't when I visited) but I have been assured parking has been thought about and it is only temporary - see their website for further details. I won't go into a lot of detail - it's a toilet.   I worry a lot about going to places in case the disabled toilets are awful. Luckily this one wasn’t. It had the grab rails you would expect and it is quite spacious. There is disabled parking free inside the boundaries of the British Museum. Clean tidy and accessible. No changing bed or hoist but for those who can use the toilet it was fine.  On this occasion we did not drive but there are several disabled parking spaces within 20 metres of the main entrance. Phone min of 24 hours in advance to book with car details. Today I travelled by train to Waterloo and onward taxi fare was £10. Taxis cannot get to the level access entrance to drop you off but the main entrance has two lifts (one each side of the steps). Flat step free disabled parking. Ring the British Museum before hand on the number on their website for access to disabled parking right by the museum main entrance via Great Russell Street. There is a 500kg open platform hydraulic lift from the parking level up to the main entrance. There were two of these lifts - one either side of the main entrance - but only one was working on the day."
british music experience liverpool,negative,There is some Blue badge parking available in the area a number of the local buses and the city tour buses all pick up and drop of in front of the building the nearest train station is the St James St Interchange about 15mins away 
british music experience liverpool,positive,"There are two accessible toilets one in the exhibition area the other in the Star Café area, we looked at the one in the exabition area it was a good size door opened outwards rails on both sides and room for a care giver if required "
british summer time festival at hyde park london,negative,"Difficulty in finding a good place to drop off and pick up, we couldn't use the accessibility vehicle as my pal's wheelchair is too long for it. But we did see lots of other wheelchair users speeding by on it and it looks a great set up!!"
british summer time festival at hyde park london,positive,Condsidering we were at a festival - a definite 5*! They were located just at the entrance to the accessible platform and 'fenced off' so that they were available exclusively for people who need an accessible loo. There were lots of them and some of them were bigger than standard which was a bonus!
brittany ferries plymouth,positive,"Provided that you advise upon booking, parking is adjacent to a lift and plenty of space is left around car for wheelchair access and handling."
brittany ferries portsmouth,positive,There is accessible parking very close to the lift on the car deck and we were directed to this.  They also ensured that enough space was left at the rear for my ramp and for me to unload and an assistant was waiting to offer us help to get to the lift and cabin if required. The en-suite was also spacious and fairly clean ( nooks and crannies which would be difficult to get really clean).  There was an accessible shower and clean towels and soap were provided. There were also grab rails and an emergency cord both in the en-suite and in the cabin.
brixworth country park brixworth,positive,There are disabled parking spaces close to the cafe - although there aren’t many. I haven’t had an issue when visiting on any given day. 
broad st mall reading,positive,Good parking and bus stops right outside
broadbridge heath leisure centre broadbridge heath,positive,"There are 6 disabled bays immediately in front of the leisure centre. Additional bays are located in Tesco car park opposite and adjacent to the centre in a hall car park. The disabled changing room is often locked (not radar key) but staff are very helpful and open immediately on request. The room is large and has an adult size adjustable changing bed, hoist, and shower. Ideal facility for wheelchair users.  Whenever we have been in however there has been no soap and no toilet roll holder. There is plenty of room for manouvering and a carer. There is a separate wooden bench to sit on and hooks for hanging. There is also a nappy disposal bin. No clear signage. The other standard disabled bathroom is always unlocked, very small but has hand rails and nappy disposal bin."
broadway cinema letchworth garden city,positive,There is a car park adjacent to cinema but you need to go early to get a space.  Ditto for the on road parking in town. All toilets are accessible but screen 1 is up a short flight of stairs which requires wheelchair assistance.  Staff are happy to give this but does draw attention to yourselves. There is on street parking at the sides of the cinema and a sizeable car park across the road so it is easy to get to by car Downstairs toilets are accessible.
broadwood farm cumbernauld,negative,"The toilets are in the enteranceway to the restaurant with the disabled toilet on the left, it can be difficult to access if busy. On a previous visit the toilet was locked from outside and you had to ask staff for access, no radar key system is in use. This time though toilet was unlocked.  The toilet does have enough space go get in but would pose a challenge for a carer to assist.   They do have a red cord but this was trapped behind the grab rail hinge, and was unable to free it."
broadwood farm cumbernauld,positive,"Broadwood Farm offers a large car park for customers with 3 disabled bays to the left of the entrance, however there are other parking bays that would offer easy access "
brockhole on windermere windermere,negative,"Disabled parking at the visitor centre very limited.  But there are spaces in the main car park.  Charges payable for disabled visitor. ( Number plate recognition)  Uphill paths in places.  2 mobility scooters to borrow free of charge.  Golf buggy available to pick up from jetty (windermere lakes cruises)  Clean loo, a bit tight on space, big wheelchairs would struggle. Tucked away in a corner."
brockholes nature reserve preston,positive,"There was plenty parking that has to be paid for at the machine as you leave. This includes blue badge holders, although it is not expensive. The car park is approx 100 yards from the floating village. For those with passengers unable to walk that distance there is a drop off point at the floating village. The accessible loo was a very good size with plenty space for turning etc."
brockwell park london,positive,"The park is a short distance from Herne Hill Station, which offers step-free access to the platforms, and access to trains via manual boarding ramps (if you're lucky enough to find any staff to assist with ramps). The park is also about a 15-minute walk from Brixton tube station, which is fully step-free from street to train. Numerous buses serve the areas around the park. I wouldn't try parking near the park."
brodick ferry terminal brodick,negative,The disabled toilet is massive huge inside as it would be used as a triage room. However not RADAR keys you ask for it at desk. It’s lower rating because of this. 
brodick ferry terminal brodick,positive,Plenty of disabled spaces and ramps to doors 
brodie castle forres,negative,"Easy to use, standard size and adaptations. Clean  Brodie Castle is on its own estate and you really need to come on an arranged tour or by your own vehicle. We arrived by car and swept into the car park but were confused by the absence of any marked accessible parking bays. We simply chose a spot where we wouldn't get blocked in and could access both sides of the car by wheelchair. It was incredibly disappointing to then struggle through the woodland path and then along the drive to get to the castle only to find there were a couple of marked accessible parking bays very close to the entrance. A small, antiquated, semi accessible toilet was available in a toilet block adjacent to the car park. Not recommended! But when you've got to go you've got to go and improvisation takes over ..."
brodie countryfare by forres,positive,"12 Disabled bays by the entrance. Bus stop 400mtrs away with busy road to cross Large room with handrails, help cord, room for a carer, clean."
brodsworth hall and gardens doncaster,positive,There are 2 accessible toilets 50 yards from the hall. Both were clean and had room for my mobility scooter Disabled loo on a tarmac path about fifty yards from cafe building.
brompton cemetery london,positive,"Earl's Court Station is the nearest fully step-free station. West Brompton Station is partly step-free: wheelchair users can roll straight onto the train on the eastbound District Line, but the westbound District Line is, perversely, totally NOT step-free. West Brompton Station is step-free for Overground services and you will need ramp assistance from staff (who are generally friendly at this station). Be sure to check with TfL before you travel, TfL's station lifts are VERY unreliable and can ruin your day. "
brooklands hotel weybridge,positive,"Interesting drive to get to hotel, and once there we found a large car park with disabled bays close to hotels entrance It was handy and easy to find, plenty of room inside and we could spin the chair in there. Disabled parking is very close to main entrance for the hotel. The toilets are clean and well maintained, large enough for your needs, although you may have to leave wheelchair by door. It has grab rails and pull cord."
brooklands ilkeston,negative,There is a disabled parking pay outside but nearest bus stop for me was 10 minute walk away. The roads were main roads but there are traffic lights with tactile pavement and a bridge. 
brooklands ilkeston,positive,Toilet was large with non-contrasting rails around the toilet. Instead of a pull cord there were switches next to toilet and on floor. There was a tiny mirror which was too high up to see from a seated position. The toilet flush handle was higher than average and was small handle. The door had no bar to assist with closing and the handle had quite a stiff lock. There is no changing facilities. 
brooklands museum weybridge,negative,Easy to find but key required from staff and a slope up to access 
brooklands museum weybridge,positive,"Specific access for users through a security gate (see their website) for parking on a hard surface right next to the main building. Mixture of accessible toilets around the site with an assortment of rails, different spaces and arrangement of fixtures.  The bus museum has a new toilet built to requirements - although the transfer space might have failed as it had a none removable wall element protruding. Disabled parking opposite entrance "
brooklands pleasure park sompting,positive,Lots of room for wheelchair Accessible Vehicles (WAV) but Hi-top vehicles need to phone ahead to get the barrier lifter to get into carpark FULL CHANGING PLACES TOILET WITH HOIST AND BENCH
brooks hotel edinburgh,positive,"Brooks is a ten-minute walk from Haymarket Railway Station, the bus interchange and the tram stop. Lothian Buses’ 35 service passes within 50m of the front door and serves the airport, the Royal Mile, Parliament, Easter Road, and The Royal Yacht Britannia.  If arriving by car or taxi you can be dropped off right outside the door. There are a limited number of private parking spaces in a nearby car park that can be booked in advance by arrangement.  The pavements in the area are fairly good for wheelchair users and have dropped kerbs with plenty of crossings. It's a short distance from the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, Lothian Road, and into the heart of the city. There are toilets in the public area but I didn’t use these. Given the proximity of the accessible bedroom it’s just as easy to use these if you are using that room. The streets in the area are busy and there’s limited on street parking. The hotel does have limited parking in a nearby facility.   Coming by public transport, I don’t drive as I’m visually impaired, it was easy to catch a bus as they stop at the top of the street where the hotel is located. It’s not too far from the railway station either. There were toilets in the public area on the ground floor; including an accessible toilet."
broomhill art hotel barnstaple,negative,Only accessible by car. Limited parking by hotel (unmarked). If you can’t park by the hotel forget it as the main car park is on the valley floor and you’ll never get up the steep road - even with a mobility scooter.
bross bagels edinburgh,positive,I scooted up the Leith Walk pavement - loads of buses up and down Leith Walk - and soon there'll be a tram too! A taxi could drop off right outside.
broth3rs restaurant perth,positive,"There is a car park area to the back of the premises and disabled on street parking located at the front of the building.  The Venue is on a local bus route. The accessible toilet is in a good position and a decent size. There is an accessible toilet, which is a good size. However the door swings inwards, so some manoeuvring is required "
broughton hub salford,positive,"I don't used a disabled parking and transport facilities as I have my own car. I do know at the busiest time most disable people cannot get on the disabled car park due to those without the disability parking badges parking there. there should be means of stooping people doing this as there is no LAW against this, there is little one can do anything about it."
broughty ferry harbour dundee,positive,"Parking was very easy with accessible parking bays on the harbour side. Further bays were just around the corner of the headland at Broughty Ferry Beach; a five minute walk away. Five stars. because nearby, five minutes, Broughty Ferry Beach has a Changing Places Toilet."
brown green brunch kitchen london,positive,"Several bus routes will drop you off nearby, and the magnificent, recently restored Victorian station is fully step free, served by both suburban railways and by the London Overground system."
brown rigg lodges bellingham,positive,"Transport not applicable; parking directly outside lodge, firm ground for wheelchair. Just on edge of Bellingham. See above"
brownie points bakery derby,positive,"There is disabled parking in the Intu centre, it isn't free. There are 161 spaces over  4 car parks. There is also various spots around the city that have free on street parking for badge holders but these spaces are limited.    Intu is located near Derby Bus Station.  The cafe itself is located in the intu centre on the ground floor so you have access to several difference accessible loos. Intu has a changing places toilet located near Debenhams on level 1."
browns bar and brasserie glasgow,positive,"On street parking around George square which is directly opposite the venue. All on street parking is free with the blue badge. Walking distance from Queen Street station too which is handy. Plenty of on street parking available and free for blue badge holders. However, none available when I visited so I parked in Buchanan Galleries which is a 5 minute walk away.   With it being right in the city centre lots of public transport available. Queens Street railway station is across the other side of George Square.  Across the square from Queens Street Train Station with plenty of on street parking. Spacious and clean "
browns bar brasserie london,negative,There are a small number of disabled parking spaces on Upper Street. You could also either get a taxi or bus to this venue and then travel the rest of the way in your wheelchair.
browns bar brasserie london,positive,"There is a large, spacious accessible toilet which is almost always open (without the need of a key). If not, staff are on-hand to assist."
browns hotel london,positive,"The nearest tube station to Brown's is Green Park, which has step free access. If you exit the station via the lift, you will come out on the Green Park side, so you will then need to cross the road to the other side of Piccadilly. Alternatively there are several bus routes stop on Piccadilly. Brown's entrance is on Albemarle Street, which is a quiet road directly off Piccadilly. The road is between Green Park and the Royal Academy, so either bus stop would do. Albemarle Street is a flat road with drop kerbs. When you turn into the road from Piccadilly the hotel is on the left hand side.  The accessible toilet is round the corner from the Drawing Room, next to the lift. It's really convenient and there is level access to it. The toilet itself was slightly raised which made the transfer easier. There were grab rails both side of the toilet. There was no grab rail by the sink, sorry my photo cut off some of the sink area. The emergency cord had been cut and was in the corner. I spoke to a member of staff about this and they said they would get it fixed. The accessible toilet was engaged when I arrived to use it, as the cleaner was inside, and it was spotless when I went in."
browns leeds,positive,"It's in town so good public transport links, but unsure where would park if using a car.  Easy to find, very large, and clean. "

bruach dundee,positive,"A council car park with disabled spaces is a few buildings down, as well as other car parks/on street parking close by and taxi rank is also nearby. There are also plenty of buses that pass through Broughty Ferry on regular basis. A train station is also situated in Broughty Ferry although I don’t know anything about how often they stop, I know it’s not that much though."
bruce accessible boats marlborough,positive,on site parking but a little uneven under foot

brunstane burn path edinburgh,positive,We did the path from Joppa towards Portobello. This begins opposite the Booker Cash & Carry and ends up at Brunstane Rail station.
brunswick arms dawlish,positive,"The pub is a level 5 minute walk from Dawlish Railway Station. The station has step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station. There are local, step free buses that stop nearby."

bt murrayfield stadium edinburgh,negative,"All the disabled parking bays are in front of The West Stand and can be accesssed with a blue badge.  If arriving by foot, there are various forms of public transport which can be used. Plenty of these around the stadium - both upstairs and down.  Large enough, but they are filthy and the locks never work. (A word of advice though - if you're pitchside, go before the match, you'll never get out if you wait till half-time!) during a non match day you can park no bother at the Disabled bays. amongst the Edinburgh Rugby teams cars, so can see some nice cars and meet players no bother. on match day its different  over the years you can see they are trying. the Parking is free with a parking pass from Scottish rugby when you request it. however they moved us this year on a match day to the ice rink which doesnt have disabled bays and caused issues when the staff security tried to make cars park super close with no door room to transfer.  i raised this with the health and safety team who will look into it. Because there were a group of us from Longstone Centre, we used Social Work transport - and were therefore allowed to use the 'drop off zone' in front of the West Stand.  However,I guess every visitor will have access to parking facilities. Accessible toilets are dotted throughout the venue.  Small but  functional - with grab rails."
bt murrayfield stadium edinburgh,positive,"We drove and parked on site in reserved disabled parking spaces. There were no problems in getting parked, it was straight off the public road & a two minute drive on site. Although I did not use them, there were 2 accessible toilets close by. They were clean & spacious with handlebars & an emergency cord. It appeared that the stewards were controlling access to these toilets. The accessible toilets near the terrace are very accessible. There are four dedicated disabled loos (2 toilets per section) which are good. Tram stop right next to stadium with a lift down to main road and plenty of disabled parking spaces. Very spacious disabled toilet and also a changing places space. Parking was easy to find and right next to the entrance to the stadium. There were plenty of places and there were no issues for the Powerchair. The parking was really good and close but a bit too busy to get out of the stadium. It was big and spacious but a wee bit messy! Brilliant... Drove straight into Murrayfield & into car park... Only thing that was slightly amiss was that there were no more disabled parking spaces so we had to get dropped off first - although this was easily enough to do. Accessible, clean & spacious disabled loos are just behind the terrace. The transport arrangements were great as there was dedicated parking close to the main door. I and a friend arrived by tram which was great for us as powerchair users. I short journey from the tram stop to the main gate. Top marks go to Murrayfield. There was more than one accessible loo and those I used were fine with ample space, spotlessly clean and everything I needed. Since my visit, and on a subsequent visit, I found Murrayfield had installed a Changing Places Toilet - in a word excellent! it can be hard to get to when crowded but if you ask staff to help you through they will stop the flow and make sure you get through ok when on match day. You are offered a parking space with your ticket or you can take the tram or the bus. Plenty accessible toilet facilities  We had been allocated a free disabled parking space in the ice rink carpark.  Plenty of stewards to show us where to go.  Excellent disabled toilets in the stadium . Manned by staff Transport is fairly easy - there is a tram stop that is conveniently located near to the main entrance. Depending on where you're going to within Murrayfield there might be a bit of a walk. Pretty good! For this visit we were in hospitality so they were a lot warmer than usual! When I used the toilet the stewards guided me through hundreds of people to the toilet. The toilet was a standard disabled toilet but it was quite wide so I had loads of room to manoeuvre. "
buchanan bus station glasgow,negative,"There is no parking next to the bus station this is due to the area being very busy in the city centre. There is a large multi story car park across the road but we did not check this out   There is a local Taxi Rank next to the bus station this is sign posted from with in the main building this can also be used if you have phoned a taxi from outside the Glasgow area. 900 service to and from Glasgow, brilliant - no more trains for me, every 15 minutes between each Cityi, I travelled to the ace Station by bus, did not notice if there was nearby parking. Ample buses stop at or nearby Killermont Road where the Station is located. The bus station does not have a car park of its own due to the close proximity to the city centre. However, there is a car park in Buchanan galleries which is very close to the bus station. There is also a taxi rank located at the rear of the bus station.  Toilets are accessible,clean and easy to find in the bus station. There is not a specific car park for the bus station, there is Buchanan galleries car park nearby which would be the most convenient parking to use if bringing a car.  There is a taxi rank beside the station so may be advised to get a taxi to save paying for parking."
buchanan centre coatbridge,positive,There are a number of Blue badge spaces in the basement area to access them you enter via South Circular Road and then Exchange Place and then a small slip road between the centre and the Asda store. You gain entry you press the button that then lets staff at the reception know you are there. Once in the car par area there are lifts to all floors. The parking in this area only for use when you are using the centre The Accessible toilet is on the Ground floor but was out of order on the day of my visit. However having seen it before it is a good accessible toilet.
buchanan galleries glasgow,positive,"There is access to disabled toilets on the ground floor, first floor and second floor of Buchanan Galleries. These toilets are fitted with hand rails and emergency aids. The doors to the toilet are wide, allowing access for wheelchairs and other necessities. For access to the disabled toilet, you must visit the information desk which is located on the first floor. The building had a car park which was located in John Lewis store however it cost £25 floor 24 hours which could be extensive if you are living of benefits. It is located a 5 minute walk away from Buchanan bus station which offers easy access of and on the buses. This shopping centre has an accessible multi-storey car park. There are both disabled and wider car parking spaces. Buchanan Galleries is a ten minute walk away from Glasgow Central Station and five minutes away from Buchanan Bus Station so again it is very easily accessed.  Nearby the bus station and close to Queens Street train station. Well thought through  There is a large multi story car park attached to the centre you can access the centre directly from the car park. The access point to the car park is on North Hanover St.  Buchanan St Bus station is a good 10 minutes walk a way as is Queen St Train Station. There are 3 wheelchair accessible toilets two of these are accessible by using a Radar key if you have one however security staff in the centre also have keys.  The 3 toilet is on the top floor area this is the food court this toilet is next to the rest of the toilets for the centre. The wheelchair access toilet is also the baby changing facility in the centre . The Galleries have their own car park. Accessible toilets are available on the ground floor as well as the first and second floors. Access to these is via a RADAR key or by asking at the information desk. The accessible toilet on the ground floor (we used this one) was spacious, bright and clean with all the expected features."
buckland abbey yelverton,positive,"Blue badge parking 150 yards from the house, there is a parking attendant directing cars to appropriate spaces when you show your Blue badge. There were plenty of spaces but it was October and so not busy."
budock vean hotel falmouth,positive,"This is a 4 star hotel just outside Mawnan Smith, not far from Port Navas.  Website with pictures - www.budockvean.co.uk                  We arrived by car - can't comment on public transport. Large car park, smooth surface. You can park by the entrance to allow disabled passengers ease of entrance and then move the car to the car park a short distance away. Disabled loo was accessible - near the reception not far from the bar area. Very clean - nice soap! Slight sill on doorway.  Room wasn't huge but big enough to cope with wheelchair and carer. All the usual griprails. Red cord available."
bullring birmingham,negative,"There were lots (at least 3) disabled toilets out of order, no explanation to why or for how long. Also all publicly accessible and not RADAR key restricted. The Changing Places facility was however immaculate and also a fan of the fact the door is ""push"" to get in meaning closing it behind you isn't awkwardly difficult."
bullring birmingham,positive,"Disabled toilets available, well labelled, ample space for wheel chair users with support bars. There is tactile and pictorial signage on or near the toilet doors Awesome public transport links all around "
bulls head sheffield,negative,There is some parking on the road outside the pub. The pavements are uneven but you can park close to the entrance. Bus stops are close by but there are no tram stops.
bulls head sheffield,positive,Disabled toilets are available but check with staff that the toilet is not obstructed by furniture.
bundits of leith edinburgh,positive,This is to the right of the bar in a sliding door. The red cord is low to the ground and there is enough space to turn. There is also great space outside the toilet which I like before you go back to the restaurant area.
burger edinburgh,negative,Works well if you take the bus or tram - could involve expensive parking and a bumpy ride if you are driving a private car to a nearby parking spot. But that's Edinburgh all over...
burger king glasgow,negative,"nearest parking is available at john lewis or buchanan galleries. the nearest bus station is the buchanan bus station it was on the second floor, need to climb the stairs to access, lack of physical aids. We parked a 10/15 min walk away near St. Andrew’s Cathedral. Also, there are some disabled bays for blue badge holders around the city if you’re early and lucky to nab one."
burger king glasgow,positive,"Accessible loos are right next door. Usual city centre parking. Renfield St if you are lucky or Concert Hall multi storey  Door opens out into restaurant but no closure spring so easy to open. Wide door then sharp left turn to loo. Contrasting rails to sink and loo. Nappy bin well placed away from pan so right to left transfer space is clear. A pity a star is lost for the call help being a button three feet up the wall. No help if one falls on the floor.  To the left of the Burger King there is a door with a pushpad on the left of the door. Pressing this takes you to the outside of two wheelchair accessible toilets! Both hand handrails on both sides, red cords hanging low and sinks that you can roll under. I used this with my powerchair and you could fit someone else in although this may be a squeeze in larger wheelchairs. Upon leaving the toilet the outer door opens automatically which is brilliant!"
burger king poole,negative,Toilets for the disabled are very poor. Small and smelly! No idea what the sliding door is all about either!
burger king poole,positive,Dolphin Centre  Car Park has accessible spaces and shopmobility
burghead fort and visitor centre elgin,positive,"Parking is very good as you can drive to the site entrance and then use the trackway to get close to the visitor centre. The site is a natural headland so it is a little lumpy and bumpy in places with so areas where you need to be able to to climb the steps or scrabble up the bank. That said, a slabbed pathway leads from the parking area up to the visitor centre."
burghead to hopeman coastal walk burghead,positive,You can park at the start of the walk beside the Diageo Distillery or there's parking in Burghead itself.  The ground is a bit rough where you park though as I'm not sure that it's actually an official car-park or just a piece of ground that people park on.  We were told to park there by residents and have never had any problems.
burnby hall gardens museum york,positive,"Some Blue Badge parking places near the entrance, but these were full on the day we went which was very busy but there is plenty of room to be dropped off if the wheelchair user is the passenger. Didn't actually use it but you can see what it is like in the photo.  We could park near the entrance in blue badge spaces although there weren't many  There is free accessible parking on site, right next to the visitor centre. From here, you enter via the shop. The doors are all automatic, which makes things easier. There is a small changing places toilet here. The entry is a bit narrow but otherwise it is good. At the moment, toilets are still signposted via the old Covid one way system. This takes you through the outdoor cafe area, which is quite tight with posts and tables. It is better to go round the other way to the toilets."
burrito n shake edinburgh,negative,No space to get in and close the door. 1 hand rail badly placed. Sink tucked away in the corner and difficult to get near in a chair (impossible in a scooter)
burrito n shake edinburgh,positive,"City centre right next to the main bus route, disabled parking spaces available in Chambers street (10 mins walk away)"
burro restaurant york,negative,"Accessible, but rather small, not sure what you would do if you were in a bit electric wheelchair maybe if wheelchair users can transfer to a smaller chair."
burton town hall burton on trent,positive,"Bus stop was outside Burton Train Station, about 10 minutes walk away. There were disabled bays outside but they were only basic, no markings to make sure people don't park too close. "
burts hotel melrose,positive,You can park in marked bays just outside hotel........you can take the train from Edinburgh to Tweedbank and get a bus into Melrose (infrequent service )
busby primary school clarkston,positive,"The gate in the older playground can open up providing easy, close parking so that you do not have to go far to get to the door It was easy to find and very big and spacious"
bush hall london,positive,"We went by car and parked at the Westfield centre. It was a 10-15 minute walk away but was fine for me in my chair.  Accessible loo was lovely. Well decorated, plenty of space for me, wheelchair and PA. All very clean and well looked after. "
bushel strike ashwell,positive,Large car-park at rear - always spaces. No/very rare public transport nearby. Easy to find as round corner from entrance. Has grab rails and is large enough for carer as well but could be even larger so not 5.
busy bee garden centre ryde,positive,Southern Vectis buses to Ryde and Sandown/Shanklin stop outside. Large car park. The far car park is tarmacked and has a number of disabled spaces. Disabled toilet on the entrance floor. Has grab bars in all the right places. Also on the lower floor with the general toilets is another disabled toilet.
bute park and arboretum cardiff,positive,Recommend parking in North Road car parks(east) or Sophia Gardens(west) or Pontcanna car park(north). Free parking with blue badge. Accessible loo available at education centre cafe but not visited.
butlins butlins somerwest world,negative,"No specific parking bays by the West Lake Chalets for disabled drivers and passengers, which is disappointing. Wider bays are essential! Only let down are the toilets, I'm not aware of any changing places toilets and the toilets are on the small side, but plentiful.  Silver chalets aren't far away from main campus to return to."
butlins butlins somerwest world,positive,"Clean, easy to use and plenty of them dotted about the site. Disabled parking is nearer to ordinary silver chalets.(don't know about specific disability chalets I would assume they are very close) large trolleys are easily available to put luggage on and staff would be happy to push those for you if needed."
buttermere valley cockermouth,positive,Accessible parking on National Park Car Park (charges apply). Accessible by bus from Keswick. Acessible toilets both in the Croft House Cafe & Car Park.
button factory dublin,negative,"In Temple Bar where paths are narrow and usually taken up by bins, the road is cobblestones"
button factory dublin,positive,There is a wheelchair parking spot on Wellington Quay and two wheelchair parking spots up beside Dublin Castle on Cork Hill. There is a lot of space and plenty of bars to hold onto in their wheelchair bathroom. It also has a sliding door so your chair won't get caught coming in or going to. They have also added more ladies and gents toilets on the ground floor so you don't have to traipse down into the basement. Downstairs accessible bathroom but lock is sometimes broken
buxton opera house pavilion arts centre buxton,negative,Parked on the street nearby with a blue badge. Drove to the venue but couldn’t locate any nearby disabled parking spaces. I was fortunate to find roadside parking adjacent to the theatre on Water Street - £2.50 for 4 hours. 
buxton opera house pavilion arts centre buxton,positive,No problem whatsoever accessible toilets are quite large and we negotiated with the frame with no problems.
bwlch nant yr arian visitor centre ponterwyd,positive,"Very good disabled parking that was free. Enough room for us to get my wheelchair out. Toilet was clean, accessible and also had a shower facility."
bygones torquay,positive,"Bygones is located in Babbacombe, which is just outside of Torquay. The nearest train station is Torquay. At time of writing (October 2018) the number 22 and 32 buses stop very nearby and have step free access. There is a car park about 2 minutes walk away, sorry I didn't use it so I don't know the details, but I did notice an accessible toilet at the car park."
byron edinburgh,positive,"While not ideal for those driving to the restaurant, the area is well served by Lothian Buses crossing busy North Bridge, and there are two taxi ranks on either side of the building. The roads are cobbled in places, but the pavements are all smooth with dropped kerbs in the immediate area. Lovely, large accessible loo in a corridor leading off of the main restaurant. It was very clean and modern, and there was a clear pathway leading up to it."
byron oxford,positive,"A good accessible toilet, well-appointed and with an emergency cord hanging free as it should. Top marks."
c r cafe restaurant london,positive,The nearest step-free tube stations are Tottenham Court Road and Green Park. Both have notoriously unreliable lifts - check before you travel.  Loads of buses run up and down nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.
c tran public transport vancouver,negative,No accessible toilets available except at Fishers Landing station in Vancouver. That one is very clean.
ca va brasserie glasgow,negative,"On streets car parking is very limited, but there is a large car park at Giffnock train station just around the corner. As well as the train there are bus stops going North and South close by. "
caalm camp shaftesbury,negative,We did not need this facility as we used mobile hoist to change in the yurt. The bathroom/ wetroom can be used with a shower chair.
caalm camp shaftesbury,positive,"You would need to drive as quite a remote area, no direct public transport."
caballo lounge epsom,positive,"Plenty of car parks near by but need to pay. As it’s on the main high street, difficult to drop off outside.  Accessible loo is great and enough space. Downside is they have an odd toilet roll dispenser which is very difficult to get paper from. "
cabana london,negative,"As the the restaurant is on the edge of Westfield Shopping centre, there's no parking other than that for the centre.  Buses don't stop right outside but obviously stop at Westfield."
cabana london,positive,"Disabled loo was clean and well equipped. There was plenty if space to get a wheelchair alongside the loo but the nappy disposal bin was positioned there.  If this was relocated, it would be fine.  This door opened inwards and wasn't heavy."
cabarfeidh hotel stornoway,negative,"Big accessible car park, but no disabled spaces that we could see."
cabarfeidh hotel stornoway,positive,Very good.
caboose blyth,negative,Disabled toilet signage however despite toilet being reasonably sized no grab rails in place at all and limited space for manoeuvring. Please see attached photos. 
caboose blyth,positive,Parking available directly outside. 
cadbury world birmingham,positive,"There are a good number of disabled parking spaces. There is one standard disabled toilet and a larger disabled toilet with changing facilities. There is separate baby changing but parents still use the disabled toilet. The larger disabled toilet you need a Radar Key for  but the standard one you do not. Halfway through the tour there is also a disabled toilet. There is also a disabled toilet in the outside bit. Plenty disabled parking spaces right by the main entrance. Fantastic disabled toilet facilities, including a toilet at the main entrance with hoist, changing table and a toilet which includes facilities for washing and drying the user. Other disabled toilets are available throughout the attraction. Plenty of disabled parking spaces, and ease of access to the complex There are loos in the main entrance building (needs radar key) and then others in the factory and down by the 4d cinema area  The one in the entrance building has a changing table with hoist, toilet with wash facility, and height adjustable sink. There was lots of disabled parking. The best disabled toilets we have ever seen everything for the disabled person would need we changed my grandson with no problems at all. Parking was good.  We used our own WAV Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle.  There were several disabled parking spaces and it was easy to get from the car park to main entrance. Good for our son's sensory experience especially smells, sounds and tastes (if allowed!) Good cafe and shop. Excellent and vital to have a Changing Places Toilet for those children and adults with PMLD, severe disabilities or more complex needs or just needing more space.  It takes a bit longer to use, especially if you are in a queue of several severely disabled people, but it really means we can get out of the house and visit an attraction just like anyone else!"
cae mor hotel llandudno,positive,"We drove there and used one of the two blue badge holder parking spaces.  The wet room was spacious enough to accommodate a carer , the washbasin was wheelchair user height, a shower chair was available on request."
cafe 1505 edinburgh,negative,"There are a lot of buses that go up South Bridge. Get off at the stop just before Nicholson Square. We needed to park & got a space in Nicholson Square and crossed the road. Its pretty busy so not brilliant, but doable. "
cafe 1505 edinburgh,positive,"I arrived by bus which stops about 50 ft from the door, and left by taxi which was able to park right outside. This is not allowed for cars, which would need to park on the street or in the square on the other side of the road. Being a main route there's lots of buses going past which are all accessible, these are the red Lothian Buses.  It's through a heavy door, which is a fire door so there's a reason! The door swung out which helps when getting in and out but is always tricky to then close to use the toilet. Other than that it was well sized, clean and stocked.  A very busy and congested part of the City, there are disabled spaces, pay bays and a car park that belongs to the Edinburgh Central Mosque in Hunter Square 50m across South Bridge Street. This is also a main bus route which links with buses to Midlothian and the Borders. There are 16 bus routes that pass this way. Excellent accessible loo at the back of the cafe. Just be aware there's quite a tight turn into it. "
cafe 164 leeds,negative,"The entrance to the toilet is step free. However, the corridor inside the toilet is extremely narrow and a wheelchair will not fit. Moreover, there are no hand rails inside the washroom.  Please Note: The toilet is not inside the café. "
cafe alice cupar,positive,There is on street parking on the High Street right at the entrance to the cafe. However if you are travelling to Newburgh via public transport the links are not the best with buses running between Newburgh and Perth once hourly.  There is one toilet which is accessible towards the back of the cafe. 
cafe andaluz edinburgh,negative,A few disabled bays available on George Street.   Central location means it will be connected to local bus and tram route.
cafe andaluz edinburgh,positive,"Yes. large, clean and beautifully decorated like the rest of the place."
cafe broma edinburgh,positive,The Broma café has its own large car park with disabled parking spaces and for those using public transport the bus stops are just outside the venue. The disabled toilet was signposted and easy to find and very spacious. It was very clean and was well stocked with hand towels and toilet paper. I thought the hand bowl could have been larger though.
cafe camino edinburgh,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Plenty of buses stop nearby in Leith Street and York Place, and the cafe is near the York Place tram terminus. Kept locked - the key is available on the counter, attached to a purple whisk, so you can't miss it. There's an alarm cord and a grab rail beside the lavatory. Misses out on five stars only because there is no grab rail by the wash hand basin and the room is quite small so manoeuvering might present problems. There's a good accessible loo. It may be a little tight for some powerchair users. It is kept locked but the key is available from the staff."
cafe central perth,negative,"City Centre location, on street parking fairly close.  Didn't use transport on this occasion."
cafe central perth,positive,"Cafe central is in the St Johns Shopping Centre in Perth Cty Centre, it is easily accessible via public transport with city centre bus stops on South Street right outside the shopping centre.  Fit for a Queen, really big.  Lift to get up to the toilets, had no problems."
cafe circa abernyte,negative,It’s a place you need a car for there is spaces
cafe continental kirkcaldy,negative,"car park up the back but the Café has no car parking of its own, its quite steep getting to and from the car park to the Cafe"
cafe continental kirkcaldy,positive,good clean toilets with lots of space
cafe de paris puerto de la cruz,positive,The restaurant is on a padestrianised part of the sea front. A taxi can take you to MacDonalds and from there it is a couple of minutes level walk.
cafe du soleil canterbury,positive,"as previously Visited them this time, well arranged and designed. Separate baby changing loo so no nappy smells. Large public car park alongside venue"
cafe fame glasgow,positive,"We parked on St Vincent Street which was only a 2 min walk to the cafe. We were able to park for free with our blue badge. I didn't use the toilet, but I was told by the owner that there is one. The next time I visit this cafe I'll try check out the toilet. I'll give this 4 stars just because I haven't actually seen the toilet yet. Easy to park in Bothwell street (I believe it's free for blue badge holders) and walk round the corner to the café on Hope Street.  Disabled toilet."
cafe florentin edinburgh,positive,"I arrived by bus. The 27 bus stops nearby on Granville Terrace. There is also ample on street parking in the surrounding streets.  There is an accessible loo to the rear of the cafe. The only slight drawback was that the door was slightly blocked by some high chairs. Loo was clean, a decent size and had a red cord and a baby change bench. "
cafe gandolfi glasgow,negative,I can't comment on the disabled parking but there is on-street parking and it would be easy to come here by taxi. The buses are not far away.
cafe h2o malvern,positive,There are two spaces reserved for blue badge holders. The cafe is only accessible by car
cafe in the crypt london,positive,"2disabled toilets, one for females, one for males The nearest tube stations are Leicester Square and Charing Cross, neither of which are step free. Nearest step free  tube stations are Green Park or Westminster. There are several bus routes that stop close by.  There are two accessible toilets, one male and one female. The toilet is spacious, clean and with grab rails. There is an emergency red cord alarm with a sign saying it needed to hang freely but the cord had been cut short.  There are some Blue Badge bays in the nearby street. London buses also pass nearby. Charing Cross station is a short distance away. There are two accessible toilets that are spacious and modern with the grab rails and features you would expect."
cafe marlayne edinburgh,negative,"Best to arrive to this venue on foot or by bus, as the cafe is on a main road but a good a good bus route. The turn leading into the toilet is very tight,although the toilet itself is large enough.  (There is baby changing in the way which staff will move if asked.)"
cafe montmartre dundee,negative,"Parking is on the street, there are disabled places but may be full."
cafe murano covent garden london,negative,"Public transport, cab, parking limited Unknown, sorry!"
cafe piccolo weymouth,negative,"Toilet was adapted to the best of their ability. Low sink, grab bars & emergency cord (however this was not close to the ground). No room for a larger wheelchair to get in & manoeuvre or transfer if a full-time user. Much smaller active chair users might be okay depending on turning circle & ability - just over 1 meter squared space from what I can remember. Very clean & tidy."
cafe renard largs,negative,the toilets were small and only had one bar. I did speak to the owner who said that they are being refurbished shortly and that another bar will be installed. This would only really be suitable for a manual wheelchair though
cafe renroc edinburgh,negative,"A bit away from the bus stops at elm row and shrub hill but residents parking is all around, can get a bit busy when Hibs are playing at home. Done spiral staircase, toilet is small and dim lighted "
cafe restaurant spreeblick berlin,negative,cobbled area no easy access by car
cafe restaurant spreeblick berlin,positive,"good facilities Can't comment on parking. Public transport in Berlin is highly accessible and the restaurant is close to Alexanderplatz Bahnhof (main line train, S-Bahn and U-bahn) all fully accessible. Spacious and very well-equipped, with a wide door. Easy to get to from the dining areas."
cafe rouge london,negative,Handy for London Bridge but no immediate parking in the area if coming by car. It apparently has an accessible toilet but this was not tested.
cafe rouge london,positive,"DLR Station Cutty Sark is step-free (so is the entire DLR network) and several bus routes serve Greenwich. Cutty Sark Station is just a few hundred yards from Café Rouge. The accessible toilet is in the adjoining Ibis Hotel, which you reached through the linking double doors. The Ibis reception staff are extremely welcoming. Regular readers of my other reviews will know that I often get annoyed about red emergency cords being tied up out of reach. Imagine my delight when, in this toilet, I found not one but TWO red emergency cords, both hanging freely to the floor! See the video link above! Half a star lost because the toilet is a bit cramped."
cafe rouge pinner,positive,"Pinner Tube station is fully step-free from street to train, many buses serve the area near the restaurant. I don't know about parking in this area."
cafe rouge sheffield st pauls sheffield,positive,Blue badge holders can park on the street adjacent to the restaurant. There are bus stop 2 minutes away and a tram stop 5 minutes away. The toilet is a reasonable size and well maintained. It is on the ground floor.
cafe roux cape town,positive,Parking Bay available right next to the pathway that leads to the restaurant.
cafe st honore edinburgh,positive,Parked really near on George Street with blue badge.  2 minutes to the restaurant.  But cobbles and Hill make it a bit awkwa.
cafe sylva leeds,positive,"Although we didn't arrive by car, we could see there was good parking nearby.  We arrived by bus and taxi. I couldn't see any obstacles that would prevent a wheelchair user accessing the building from the car park."
cafe tartine edinburgh,negative,"Not amazing parking To gain entry to the accessible toilets may be the only (small negative) to this place. You have to go through two sets of doors to get to the toilets. Once through the first door, the accessible toilet is immediately on the left as you go in, and you have to try and turn and open the door at same time. Once in, the toilet is adequate."
cafe tartine edinburgh,positive,"Funky sign on the door to indicate the accessible loo. It's also the baby changing loo. Fairly spacious, clean and tidy. One accessible WC available"
caffe co co perth,positive,Close to local bus services and on street parking. There was one there but I didn't use it.
caffe concerto london,positive,"Lots of buses go up and down Piccadilly, and Green Park Station is very nearby and is fully step-free (when the lifts are working - check before you travel!)."
caffe corretto gloucester,negative,"There is a car park about 400 yards away, which is free to blue badge holders for 3 hours.  There is quite a steep slope exiting the car park and two more slight slopes into Gloucester Dock/Quay area.  The path is paved and is in good condition."
caffe nero bristol,positive,"Buses stop close to here and there are a lot of carparks next to this, the closest multi storey carpark seems to be the one for the Galleries shopping centre."
caffe nero canterbury,positive,"City Centre café has no parking of its own, but there is some disabled parking nearby. There are two unisex toilets, one larger than the other and marked for disabled use. It is well appointed and spacious."
caffe nero edinburgh,negative,"I walk here, there is a bit of a climb up a gradient up to Lauriston Place where theres a few Lothian Buses - 23, 27, 45 and 35.  Not easily accessed by car as parking in the area is limited Limited parking options given its in the centre of town on Princes street (theres a small amount of on street parking in charlotte square). Lots of buses and trams stop near though. There is one advertised as being on the 5th floor but you can only get to the lift if you've accessed the store from the side entrance. There is no disabled parking but there are spaces near by. Bus stop right outside It could be a good accessible toilet but grab rails were in the wrong places! and they were seriously unclean!"
caffe nero edinburgh,positive,"There is plenty of parking at The Fort and bus links. Spacious and clean Decent accessible toilet not far from the counter. Only issue was its quite a tight fit past the pillar but ok. Accessible toilet was great - but maybe a little narrow. Good size but as mentioned previously large bucket under the hand dryer which makes it awkward to access easily Lots of buses stop at the bus stop outside the Usher Hall, about 150m away.  There is a disabled parking bay on Cambridge street (Traverse side of the Usher Hall). Tricky to park on Lothian Road if you needed to be nearer to the venue than that."
caffe nero falkirk,positive,There was an accessible toilet.
caffe nero glasgow,positive,The store is pedestrianised section near the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. There is parking in the nearby Buchanan Galleries.  Also not far from Queen street train station (c5 mins walk). Not sure about local buses. Good large loo at back of cafe.  A few things (highchairs etc) a bit in the way outside of it but pretty good apart from that.
caffe nero inverness,negative,"There is no on-site parking as it's located on a pedestrianised precinct but it's only a few minutes walk from parking in the Eastgate Centre nearby; it's also a few minutes walk from the train and bus stations. On-street parking is a bit further away and it can difficult to get a disabled space, especially at the time of day when I visited."
caffe nero inverness,positive,"We actually parked in the Eastgate centre and walked over to Caffè Nero. It was a 5 minute walk. The toilet was large and well kept, the door stayed open so it was easy to move in and out.."
caffe nero leamington spa,positive,Drove myself and parked up. Good selection of spaces adjacent to venue
caffe nero london,negative,"The disabled toilet is not very big and a power chair cannot really be turned around inside it which means you have to reverse out and there is not much space to get out the door because there is quite a narrow corridor outside the door. In the narrow corridor there are often high chairs stacked up which mean that the door cannot open fully or, as in this visit, hardly at all! Please see photos"
caffe nero london,positive,"Great! We came over bridge from Stratford International and popped in before heading into Westfield itself. Stratford Jubilee line station also nearby. Accessible loo clean & tidy. It's one loo for everyone. There is on street parking behind the venue This branch of Caffè Nero is just yards from the Shepherd's Bush Overground station, which is step-free and has wheelchair ramps. The tube station is not step-free, despite being very new, which is a puzzle. Zillions of buses come and go, as you would expect, at this bus station. So overall this location is well served by accessible transport. On street parking and good bus thanks Plenty of space in the disabled toilet."
caffe nero newcastle upon tyne,positive,"Great public transport as it's in the Eldon Shopping Centre and lots of buses stop close by. There is also a car park attached to the shopping centre, although I didn't park there so I'm unsure on how many accessible parking bays there are."
caffe nero norwich,negative,"If you can get to it, the refurbished toilet is too small for a wheelchair to turn around in it, and the emergency cord dangles about 4 foot off the ground. This is not tied up, it has been designed that short!"
caffe nero paphos,negative,The shopping Mall did have lots of underground parking but we did not se it.
caffe nero paphos,positive,The Shopping Mall had good accessible toilets as one would expect in a modern building.
caffe nero stirling,positive,"Parking not very close but within walking distance snf not too far from bus and train station, especially as I was on my mobility scooter.  Excellent with a free red cord.  There is a dedicated accessible loo with a radar key. "
caffe nero truro,negative,Town centre parking so depends on how busy it is!  However there are disabled spaces outside.
caffe nero truro,positive,Ground floor disabled toilet. There is no parking outside the cafe as it is in a pedestrianised shopping area but there are multiple disabled parking areas around Truro's main shopping area. There is also the multi-storey behind M & S so you have to come through the store and out onto Lemon Quay and Caffe Nero is just opposite.  The Bus Station is just a few steps away as well.  The cord was hooked up and had also been snapped near the top so some helpful person had turned it round and tied it up by the bottom handle. There was also bins in the transfer area.  I spoke to the duty manager and she could see exactly what the problems were and promised to sort the bins straight away and said she’d get the cord sorted.  The toilet wasn’t the cleanest but not filthy either. The flush was on the transfer side ( though only transfer from one side.) I carded the cord and explained the thoughts behind it. I’ll pop in again in a week or so and see if things have been sorted.  I POPPED IN AGAIN AND ALL PROBLEMS HAD BEEN SORTED. THERE IS NOW A SHINY NEW CORD FITTED AND THERE WERE NO BINS IN THE TRANSFER AREA. A GREAT BIG THANK YOU TO NERO'S FOR THERE PROMPT ACTION.
caffe nero york,negative,There is no parking directly outside the coffee shop but there is disabled parking at one of the car parks about 5 minutes walk away.
caffe tropea london,positive,"The nearest tube Russell Square is not accessible as it has lift and stairs. The nearest accessible tube is King's Cross. King's Cross and Euston train stations are nearby and from there you can then change onto a bus. There are a number of buses that stop very close by. At time of writing June 2018, the bus numbers are 10, 59, 68, 91, 98, 168 and 188. I'm sorry I can't comment on parking. There is a ground floor accessible toilet. It's spacious, clean with grab rails but no emergency cord. The first time I went I was standing for a while to get into the accessible toilet and when I went to ask staff to check if someone was in it, they came with me and opened it, telling me it sometimes locks itself."
caffi cwtch wrexham,negative,One disabled toilet but this was the only customer toilet for the cafe. 
caffi cwtch wrexham,positive,"We drove, there was ample parking on the day with a number of disabled spaces. I think it could get busy as the parking is shared with hospice visitors. A table can be booked at the cafe if needed. "
caffir ceunant abergynolwyn,positive,small car parking area
caird hall dundee,positive,"There is plenty of parking facilities around town. It was somewhat easy to find the loo but there isn’t a lot of room in the cubicles. Its right in the centre of town so l'd imagine lots of buses stop nearby, and its near the train station.  We drove - theres a car park underneath which we were allowed to park in with a blue badge which was really helpful. Good sized. One pretty near the entrance to the main hall."
cairngorm mountain cairngorm,negative,There was a lot of disabled parking. There were plenty of disabled parking spaces .  They were very easy to find.
cairngorm mountain cairngorm,positive,"Parking about 2 minutes from booking office then lift to information gallery and railway.Special carriage at the bottom for wheelchairs so absolutely fabulous views down the mountain . Easy access to viewing terrace and cafe which had lovely home baking and reasonably priced. Disabled loo clearly marked and staff showed where lifts and loo were when getting off the carriage, I say getting off but it was totally level access for the disabled seats. Very clean,roomy,with good rails. Plenty of car parking, but make sure you park towards the right hand side of the building to access through the disability Scotland Ski centre entrance to avoid the steep incline to the main entrance. Toilets clean tidy,  grab rails and plenty of space to manoeuvre with carer and wheel chair."
cake cafe north berwick,positive,Just outside the cafe there is offstreet parking for Blue badge holders.  There is also a bus stop nearby.  There is also a train station in North Berwick.  There is a disabled toilet .
cake stories hoults yard newcastle upon tyne,negative,Accessible toilet down corridor- slightly impeded by a table that obstructed the corridor. If using wheelchair this would need to be moved. Toilet accessed via double door. Appropriate grab rails available in the toilet with call bell also. Toilet clean and tidy with appropriate room to manoeuvre wheelchair around or for a carer to assist. 
cake stories hoults yard newcastle upon tyne,positive,Parking opposite shop available
cakes and ale cafe and bar swindon,negative,"The toilet *is* accessible, but only just.  A larger wheelchair would be difficult to manoeuvre, but they have obviously tried very hard to make it as accessible as possible."
cala de sant francesc blanes,positive,"We drove there. Don't know about public transport. As you drive down towards the beach, you reach a small roundabout with blue badge parking on your right. I suggest you ignore that and carry on down the hill (2nd exit) to a level car park, much easier.  There were public loos next to the cafe with a ramp up to them and an accessible loo. It was locked but an attendant appeared with a key before I'd even registered this. All clean inside. "
cala galdana resort cala galdana,negative,I didn't use any disabled toilets but I did see a sign for them by the Red Cross building.
calamansac sail loft falmouth,positive,"Parking is excellent - you get close to the front door, plenty of space for 2/3 cars. The path you arrive on through the beautuful wood is absolutely fine for a car. If you have a converted WAV with very low clearance above the ground, you need to take it very slowly. You need a car to go anywhere, as you are above Port Navas village.  The narrow high hedged Cornish roads to get there and in the general area can be single track with passing places. See other sections too -  each WC is at a slightly different height - so you have a choice. The master bedroom and the utility room WCs have all the usual griprails. No wash/dry function on the loos. Normal flushing system buttons (not the ""lean back to flush"" style). Emergency buttons (not red cord). Good space around, plenty for carer. Every thing is very clean, new, stylish."
calanais visitor centre callanish,negative,"There is step free access from the main car park to the centre (up a slope).  However, there are no dedicated disabled spaces, while there are four coach spaces with easy access to the centre.  One of these could be made a disabled space?"
calanais visitor centre callanish,positive,"Great toilet - spacious, well-equipped and clean.  It is also accessed through a single door from outside.  However, the small step from the outside needs addressed so that those without help can get in easily."
calderglen country park glasgow,positive,Disabled toilet is at the entrance to the conservatory. Red cord does not reach the floor 
calderhead high school shotts,positive,"School buses have ramps if needed and disabled parking spaces directly outside the main entrance along with a drop off point. The nearest public bus stop is out the gates and down the hill, so not ideal. Disabled toilet a little bit down a corridor from the entrance."
caledonian sleeper   glasgow   london glasgow,negative,"The accessible toilet is adequate, but I'm extremely disappointed that it isn't en suite with a shower as advertised in rooms for non-disabled guests. The turning space in the toilet would be enough for a small powerchair or a manual wheelchair user, but there certainly isn't enough room for a large powerchair and a PA. The toilet does speak to you(!) which is useful for VI guests, but can become annoying at night! "
caledonian sleeper   glasgow   london glasgow,positive,Access to Central Station is easy by public transport.
caledonian sleeper inverness,positive,"Toilet immediately next to the berth, large turning and transfer space, good rails, powered door marked in large print and Braille"
caledonian stadium inverness,negative,"The toilets can be hard to access as even though it clearly says ""disabled toilets"" on the door, everyone else uses the toilet. I needed the toilet but there was a LONG queue of about 20 people and not one of them was physically disabled and it took me 20 minutes to get to the front of the queue.  "
caleta de fuste beach castillo caleta de fuste,negative,"I really need to start using the toilets but alas I didn't use them.  Access from the walkway was terrible - see the photo below  Although if one was actually on the beach, it would be okay."
calf hey reservoir haslingden,positive,very easy if you drive
calgary zoo calgary,positive,"Plenty of parking, can use British blue badge in Canada.  Train station at zoo. Plenty of accessible toilets, they appeared clean, rooms big enough to allow carer as well. "
callander meadows callander,negative,"The toilets are in the other carpark on the opposite side of the main road. If you have a car with you, best to drive there as there's a very steep hill to go up to get into the carpark and up to the loos. The disabled loo is ok (you need a radar key) but not always that clean."
callander meadows callander,positive,"Not many blue badge spaces, but it's a very big car park and usually plenty of room and blue badge parking is free anywhere not just in the marked bays."
callendar house falkirk,negative,uneven grounds and muddy entrances
callendar house falkirk,positive,"Located inside Calendar Park, the house is a bit of a drive from the main road. There is a very bumpy, slightly confusing guest car park a few minutes walk from the main entrance, but there are accessible parking spaces, wide and spacious, right at the front door.  The disabled car park is very close to the door too. The toilets had plenty of handrails and automated doors."
callendar square falkirk,negative,"Not always the nicest or tidiest, but they are available. There are more accessible toilets along the High Street in the Howgate Centre, and these are usually a bit nicer. "
callendar square falkirk,positive,"Good car park, always spaces available. There are numerous accessible car parking spaces on different levels, but the best is on level four which leads into the shopping centre, via Shopmobility and automatic doors."
callendar wood falkirk,positive,Drove- disabled parking right outside Callendar House
calouste gulbenkian museum lisbon,positive,"There is disabled parking at the door to the museum. Easiest way is to take a cab. For the sake of our Euan's we did it on public transport, in this case the Metro (underground) see the sacrifices we make! If you go by Metro you alight at San Sebastao. Do not take ""El Corte Ingles"" access if you can't do steps. Once out of the underground head for the crossing at the El Corte department store. Cross downhill onto Rua Marques de Fronteira. Behind the tall new building you will see a gate to a fortress. Forwa d of the take a left down a narrow street Rua Doutor Nicolau Bettencourt. Follow the red asphalt path to the bottom of the hill, round to the right and enter the museum park via the driveway for cars. Follow it round to the left to the main door to the museum. Ignore the path marked with the wheelchair symbol that just takes you into the park.  Toilet has good features but you need to get attendant to your unlock it. She is usually hovering in the ladies. No way to lock from the inside so sing!  No red cord. I presume attendant stands with her hairnet jammed up against the door to answer your cry. "
calthorpe community garden london,positive,"Public transport to the gardens is very accessible. King's Cross is the nearest tube and train station and both are step free. From the tube/ train station it's an easy, step free short walk straight down Gray's Inn Road. The gardens are on your left and directly opposite is Westminster Kingsway College. It should take about 5 - 10 minutes depending on your speed.  From King's Cross you can also take the bus number 46 from outside of King's Cross Station. Alternatively there is bus number 17 which stops in Caledonian Road. Both buses stop directly outside the gardens and the stop is called Heathcote Street. If you are travelling from King's Cross, due to the one way system, buses are unable to go directly down Gray's Inn Road, so the bus takes a longer way round and the stop is the second or third after King's Cross Station.  On a bus back to King's Cross, the number 17 stops in York Way, next to King's Cross Train Station, whereas the number 46 stops in Pancras Road, the road in between King's Cross and St Pancras Stations.  Travelling north on the number 17 or 46, from the City of London or Holborn, exit at Eastman Dental Hospital bus stop and then continue north in the direction of the bus and the gardens are on your right hand side. There is an accessible toilet in the main building, which has step free access. I visited during covid precautions, so I was accompanied into the building where the accessible toilet is. It was is clean and the grab rails are very sturdy, my transfers aren't very good at the moment and I felt very safe, no wobbly rails. The room is quite spacious, but the location of the sanitary bin and fold up table might need moving to enable a wheelchair user to manoeuvre in the space. There is no emergency red cord.  Please note the gardens are about 5 - 10 minutes away from King's Cross Train Station which has a changing places toilet."
calton heritage learning centre glasgow,negative,Didn't see a car park Doors not easy to open. Very heavy with a chair or walking aids Only used sink I don't believe there is a parking area but cars are allowed to park in the side street. There are bus stops nearby.
calton heritage learning centre glasgow,positive,"Their is no parking as such but on street and its easy to find within the east end of Glasgow Came by taxi to GDA, dropped off outside. Small - no turning space, door was not automatic. Red cord in corner behind handrail close to the toilet. There are disabled and normal toilet access for people using the centre or attending meetings."
calvert trust exmoor wistlandpound,positive,"We arrived on a coach which was a bit of a squeeze but we managed it. Decent size carpark with flat or ramped access to all buildings. Cleaned daily shower ensuites and larger accessible bathrooms all with access to mobile hoists. Also plenty of extra toilets around the building. There is a large car park at the centre and drop of points too, the car parking is free and is right next to the centre. There is a station at Barnstable and if requested the minibus will come and pick you up from the station. There are a whole variety of accessible toilets, from grab rails to changing places areas, high needs wash areas plenty of room for our van"
calvert trust kielder low craneclough,negative,We used a transport service as the place is in the middle of Kielder forrest. 
calvert trust kielder low craneclough,positive,"I travelled by train to Hexham then used the Centres minibus service to the centre. The  minibus is first class and the driver was safe and considerate of her passengers zlong the narrow country lanes.  My bedroom had z wetroom with a disabled toilet within it. My powerchair could manoeuvre within the wetroom...just. Due to understandable hygiene restrictions I did not use the disabled toilet in the lounge znd common room area.  There is plenty of parking.  We stayed at a lodge within the park, there was a car parking space right outside which made it easy to access the lodge.  We drove, parking is good - plenty of space for all.  Our wheelchair user son got a train to Hexham, where he was met by Calvert Trust's minibus.  He always travels that way. Public transport to the centre is very limited - a couple of times a day on some days only - but is accessible and friendly. The site is very, very remote! Ample disabled parking. They offer accessible minibus from the nearest train station (an hour's drive) The public toilets: two I think don't quite meet Part M as they are slightly too narrow. The third (slightly hidden) one does. The en suite toilets are fully accessible. Though there's no Changing Places toilet, I'd argue the pool toilet approaches these levels, and I know they're also working on extending that one. Lodge has a wet room with grab rails at loo. Access is via carpeted bedroom. We managed transfers with a sara stedy despite the carpet. "
camber lawn tennis club london,positive,"Plenty of parking and room to manoeuver a large vehicle such as a WAV. There are currently no blue badge spaces marked out, but there is plenty of parking close to the clubhouse, and I have been told that these spaces will be marked out in the near future. A large and very well maintained accessible loo with plenty of room for a wheelchair and a carer if necessary."
cambo country house and estate st andrews,negative,Accessible parking is available 
cambridge american cemetery and memorial coton,positive,We drove there - it’s well signposted from the road and there is a decent sized car park. The Cambridge city sightseeing bus also stops there.
cambridge arts theatre cambridge,negative,"The accessible toilet on the ground floor where the stalls are is adjacent to where the queue is for the ladies toilets, so there is not much space. the toilet has a sign saying ""Special Needs Use Only"", as a disabled person I feel that the signage should not use euphemisms,  and there is a wheelchair symbol. The door to the toilet folds up and there are grab rails and an emergency cord.   The toilet was blocked when I first visited and would not flush. I reported it to the box office staff and it was fixed by the interval."
cambridge arts theatre cambridge,positive,"The theatre is about a 30 minute walk from Cambridge train station and is in the city centre, near the Market Square. There are buses that stop nearby. Parking is available nearby, either on street or in the Grand Arcade car park. There are 4 blue badge parking spaces immediately outside the theatre entrance on Peas Hill, 2 in Wheeler Street and 7 on King's Parade, all close to the theatre. Accessible buses are available into the city centre. There are accessible toilets on each level. The ground-floor accessible toilet has a folding door, drop-down rails, emergency cord  and space for side transfer. It is situated next to the ladies' toilet, which can lead to access problems when there are queues. It is not RADAR-key protected. Blue bade bays outside and in nearby streets. Large multi story car park near by with plenty of blue badge spaces Plenty of accessible toilets. One on every floor. There is a lift but it isn't huge."
cambridge folk festival cambridge,negative,"There are accessible toilets situated at a number of places around the festival site. These are variable in size and design - we have generally found the best and most spacious one is by the front of Stage 2. In 2018, for the first time, there was a Changing Places toilet on site, provided by Mobiloo. This was situated just off the tarmac path near Cherry Hinton Hall, to the right of the entrance to the main arena area."
cambridge folk festival cambridge,positive,"No parking is available on site, but parking for ticket holders is available at local schools within a short distance of the festival site. Drop-off facilities are available for blue badge holders who are camping, and an accessible bus service stops at the site throughout the festival. There is also an accessible shuttle minibus service to and from the car park and the other campsite at Coldhams Common. Parking in neighbouring streets is highly discouraged."
cambridge junction cambridge,positive,"Cambridge Junction is situated south of the city centre, on the piazza of Cambridge Leisure Park, not far from the railway station and on bus routes. There are a number of blue badge parking spaces immediately in front of the venue, and a multi-storey car park close behind it, with more blue badge spaces at ground level. Car parking is controlled by NCP, and there are no concessionary rates. Large accessible toilet on ground floor, with wide door. Fixed rail on right and drop-down rail on left. Plenty of space for side transfer. There is a second accessible toilet on the top-floor balcony level, accessed via a lift. Not as large as the ground-floor toilet, but still fully accessible, this time with fixed rail on left and drop-down rail on right."
cambridge university botanic garden cambridge,negative,"On-street parking is available near the entrance in Bateman Street and in adjacent Trumpington Street, with some pay-and-display bays but no dedicated Blue Badge parking. Bus routes pass along Hills Road and Trumpington Street nearby, and most of the bus services have wheelchair access. From the Station Road Gate entrance it is a short walk (or push!) to the railway station. We parked on Bateman street but found finding an appropriate space to facilitate our van and ramp difficult.  The pavement leading to the entrance from Bateman street was uneven and an uncomfortable ride for wheelchair users."
cambridge university botanic garden cambridge,positive,"There are three accessible toilets: one at the entrance, one at the cafe and one behind the glasshouses. The latter two also include baby-changing facilities, which can cause queues. The three vary in design. The outside loo is spacious and easy to use but I found the inside loo is a bit tight for a powerchair to access. The toilets were clean and easy access. However there were no paper towels and some learners were unsure of the electric dryers."
cambushinnie croft cromlix,positive,"I drive so use my own adapted vehicle. Parking on tarmac is flat with ramped easy access to premises. Roll in shower off ground bedroom. Plenty of rails around toilet. Very easy. Excellent. Good on-site parking, big enough to park and turn a minibus. The downstairs bedroom has an on suite toilet which has a wet floor shower with grab rails and a portable shower chair. There is also rails around the toilet. plenty parking at the croft one wet room ample room for a self propelled shower chair also two family bath rooms. parking at the door. nothing to add. Flat tarmac driveway,slope up to the doors. Very good"
camden court hotel dublin,negative,"Bedroom lovely but very tight, tricky to get wheelchair around bed, also lining it up to get through bathroom door had to be precise, not much of a turning circle to get through door or turn once inside bathroom. Toilet had good grabrails, bath had a few grabrails and was low but not really wheelchair friendly, there was no 'bit' at end of bath, like in say travelodge or premier inn rooms, that you can transfer onto before lowering into bath. had to just wash at sink for safety reasons."
camden court hotel dublin,positive,"Got taxi in and out from Airport, so access to hotel was no problem"
camelford town camelford,positive,Good public toilet outside the public park.
cameo cinema edinburgh,negative,The cinema being situated at a busy street has only few limited parking spaces right outside the front entrance (available after 6 pm)  Altho there is a brilliant bus link (Lothian busses) bus stop situated right outside the entrance so very easy and almost effortless connection if getting the right bus service.
cameo cinema edinburgh,positive,"Disabled toilet located outside screen 1. Big and spacious, easy to get in and out and to use.  Generous size , well equipped , rather unusual light switch is a string hanging of the celling at the right hand side by the door (not the red emergency one )"
camera obscura and world of illusions edinburgh,negative,"Bus and taxi, and disabled parking at the castle."
cameron house alexandria,negative,"Only two measly disabled spaces no lines define the space. One very good toilet in sports and leisure area, however shared with the only disabled shower room. unsure how good facilities are in hotel area."
cameron toll shopping centre edinburgh,negative,Came on the bus. Buses quite frequent and all low floor. Ramp from bus stop down to shopping centre door. Did see disabled parking spaces for cars. A large car park with plenty of disabled bays (I would say the only problem is drivers using these without a badge).  The centre is on a main bus route too. A bit on the small side but otherwise very good.
cameron toll shopping centre edinburgh,positive,"There is ample parking with blue badge designated parking spaces near both entrances. There is a bus stop just outside the centre which is covered by quite a few different bus routes. There is also a taxi rank just outside.  A fairly spacious accessible toilet.  The car park is substantially larger than most, no multi story, all on one level, has Disabled identified spaces near every entrance point, with wide and spacious lanes. The Center is concierge staffed with an information point, Disabled shopping trolleys are available at all trolley depots within and without the location. Surrounding the Cameron Toll Center, there are 35 different City services and Out of Town provided, this includes Airport 300 link bus. There are 2 taxi collection and drop off points. Dedicated fully accessible and equipped toilets, RADAR facility also available, serviced regularly. No access issues. Buses stop outside the centre. Plenty of parking and designated disabled bays. Accessible toilet off the main concourse. An accessible toilet is off the main shopping aisle.  Large enough for power chair."
camp courageous whitehouse,positive,"free parking and lots of it clean spacious, provided wipes and gloves "
camp nou barcelona,positive,"We caught a metro and then walked the rest of the way.  Public transport is exceptional for wheelchair users across Barcelona with most metro stations accessible. Every bus in the city is also accessible, with a handy electric ramp that lowers itself.    Easy to find with plenty of space. "
campanile hotel glasgow,positive,"Several disabled spaces in front of hotel entrance Loo on ground floor opposite entrance to bar , very good. Accessible bathroom in room was huge. Had grab rails etc but as usual loo roll was perched on cistern. Excellent shower. Room had an upright chair useful if extra support needed getting in/out of bed."
camperdown wildlife centre dundee,positive,"No designated disabled spaces that I could see. I did park further away from the play park area though as I took my dog on a long walk however, there is a car park right next to the play area and there might be disabled spaces there. There is a bus stop just outside the park, but I would recommend going by car as you would have to walk up a road to get to the park and it's quite a distance.  This is something I was really happy about. It's the first public place I have seen in Dundee to have a changing place toilet, it is very spacious for a wheelchair and 2 helpers if needed. There is a tracking hoist going from bed to toilet and also a privacy curtain.   The sign says that you can pick a radar key up from the kiosk or wildlife cafe, however the kiosk isn't always open so I had to go to the wildlife centre with is a little bit far to go. The kiosk is only open when it's really sunny and busier. Probably more in the school holidays.   The only thing that made me take off half a star is because the bed is quite hard to lie on and with me having a curved spine I have to lie on something softer.  There is ample free parking opposite the main entrance to Camperdown Wildlife Centre."
campervan brewery tap room edinburgh,positive,Buses going down Leith Walk Fully accessible and spacious 
camping de lile dor amboise,positive,"Flat access to all pitches  Basic but good. Could do with a few more handrails but huge washrooms and decent enough toilet and shower space - not cluttered with bins etc and not shared baby change! Plenty of accessible sanitary facilities across the site, spotlessly clean. "
campo defiori roma,negative,Cars do drive past here but it's really more of a pedestrianised area. There are busses on the main road just a short walk from the square.
campus coffee newcastle upon tyne,negative,"It is easy to find the disabled toilet, but if you are unsure staff are willing to help. However due to the size of the premises it is quite small and not the easiest to manoeuvre in."
canary wharf dlr station london,positive,As a means of public transport the DLR (Dockland Light Railway) is great as you can roll straight on and off the trains with a wheelchair. Once on the train there's a dedicated wheelchair space.
canary wharf underground station london,negative,Canary Wharf is well placed for the business district. It's not too far from the DLR stations for connections. Canary Wharf station does have accessible toilet facilities. These we're closed during my visit due to some building works.
cancer research uk edinburgh,negative,Accessible parking in centre carpark although not too close. Good bus service close by.
candlelight bar dublin,positive,"Lots of accessible parking, a 5 min walk from Dundrum Luas stop Fully accessible loo"
cannon hill park birmingham,positive,The parking is good but the park gets busy. Edgebaston cricket ground is just over the road so avoid match das as parking gets full. I find these toilets to be very good. Doors are easy to open and for me there are plenty of handles to hang off. On most of my visits these toilets are very clean.
canoe fresh foods market washago,negative,Parking to the side of the building. No designated wheelchair space.
canoe fresh foods market washago,positive,"Easy to find, lots of space."
canterbury cathedral canterbury,positive,"We contacted the Cathedral prior to the visit and booked a place to park by giving our registration plate next to the Cathedral. The toilets are separate from the cathedral and are in a new block near to where you park within the grounds. Enough room to manoeuvre. We arrived by motorhome and headed for the coach and motorhome parking next door to Sainsbury's. We were worried that it might be full, being a bank holiday weekend, but there was just one coach plus us. Parking was £15 for up to 12 hours for motorhomes. However, if you park a car in any pay and display car park, with blue badge, it's free. Shame they don't do the same for motorhomes with blue badge!  Having parked, it was about a 15 minute walk to the cathedral. It is well signposted. The only difficulty is that many parts of the city are cobbled. It was manageable but hard work. There are also several places that lack dropped kerbs but most of the roads are either pedestrianised or very quiet, so I just wheeled down the middle of the road."
capability scotland dundee,positive,"There are six disabled parking spaces next to capability and the pavement is flat. There is plenty of room and easy automatic doors and there are hoists. There are 3 disabled spaces right outside of this building and 3 space outside the buildings at either side, all in all there are plenty of disabled and non-disabled parking spaces close by the Capability Scotland building. If you are blue badge holder you can park free of charge, otherwise you have to pay for parking.  The train station is roughly a 12 minute walk away, although take into account there are some traffic light crossings. Pavements are flat however and all crossings have appropriate dipped kerbs. Building is also close to city centre so plenty of bus stations within a 10 minute walk an Dundee bus station is roughly a 7 minute walk.  There are two great changing place toilets within the Capability Scotland building, these are fully equipped with a hoist, bench and privacy curtain. Toilet is placed in the center of the wall which means that if you are able to transfer yourself.  The only problems I had were that I couldn't reach the lock and open button for the door with the toilet because the radiator was in the way, but I would have someone with me to help, not sure if others in wheelchairs would manage. Also I struggled to reach the sink. But I am delighted there are more changing place toilets available, it is open 9am until 5pm Monday till Friday. Six disabled parking spaces. Flat ground and traffic lights from train station Toilets very accessible. waste bin set in unsuitable location though, blocking access to toilet from one side. Changing facilities. User friendly shower. Red cord card-ised"
capilla tapas restaurant thurso,negative,Unfortunately the loo though clean and tidy is reached through the main restaurant which is accessed up two or three steps to get into it. There is a rail to hang on to though. 
cappielow park greenock,negative,"CAR PARKING There is a Car park on the hill, east of the Stadium, accessed via Sinclair Street. LEAVING THE CARPARK Dispersal controlled by Police at the end of Sinclair Street. TOILETS and REFRESHMENTS Poor access, approached round the end of the Main Stand"

captains cabin tea rooms bucklers hard,positive,There were disabled bays in the car park Accessible loo round the side of the tearooms
carberry tower mansion house and estate musselburgh,negative,Token disabled parking space. No extra room at the sides for access. Plenty of space when we were there though.
carberry tower mansion house and estate musselburgh,positive,"Generally very good, but no shelves for anything, so living out of a toilet bag. You have to come by car. There is no bus. There are local options but you would have to walk a significant distance.   We parked in a normal parking space in front of the building.   There is a single ""wheelchair/accessible"" parking space just in front of the main building. However is just a normal space with a blue sign of a wheelchair on it. There is no extra space around it for if you have a wheelchair ramp etc. "
card factory bristol,negative,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately away near Waitrose on Link Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
card factory greenock,positive,There are toilets available throughout the shopping centre. They are not located within individual shops.
cardiff central library cardiff,positive,roomy toilet via lift access
cardiff civic centre cardiff,positive,"Free blue badge parking (on-street meters).  If visiting museum, free parking in CP, go to gift shop for exit tokens. Disabled bay in front of museum."
cardiff indoor flea market cardiff,positive,A couple of dedicated off-road disabled parking available near entrance. Plenty of other parking nearby.
carding mill valley and the long mynd church stretton,negative,"Not much we can say, the journey is along country lanes, no toilets in sight. The Inn at Bridges has toilets of course, but we had no use for them, and the only other place you may need them would be at Church Stretton, and these are only basic public toilets."
cardosis espresso bar paisley,positive,Separate disabled toilets with grab rail but no emergency assistance cord. Clean and tidy with room for a carer.  Due to the positioning of a table near the door to toilet it may be awkward to manoeuvre to access.
cardosis paisley,negative,On a very steep road. Are spaces outside if you can get them 
carfin grotto motherwell,positive,Adjacent to rail station and on a bus route. Ample parking at the chapel.  Toilets are in the main chapel. Roomy with good circulation and transfer space but I have taken off a star as although there is the usual wide door one has to go through a standard width door to get to it. Sink has been boxed in thus limiting access for a chair user. 
carfraemill hotel lauder,positive,We drove. There is ample parking to the side of the hotel.   The disabled toilet is on the ground floor  and wheelchair  accessible. See photo 
carhartt london,positive,"Tottenham Court Road tube station is step-free street to train (Northern Line), street to platform (Central Line) and is just a few blocks away. Green Park station is fully step-free and is a short bus-ride away, in Piccadilly.  Several bus routes will drop you off at Cambridge Circus, which is quite near."
carlton george hotel glasgow,negative,"As it`s in centre of Glasgow, parking can be limited so think taxis might be better & there is good drop off point in front of hotel but there are many car parking facilities through out and close by"
carlton george hotel glasgow,positive,"Great, plenty of room and thought out wll"
carlucci restaurant dunfermline,positive,Usual city parking. On street parking for blue badge outside hours of 12-3 Smart and modern with all required rails. Good contrast between white suite and grey slate walls. Right to left transfer space. 
carluccio london,negative,"There is a wheelchair-accessible toilet, but the red emergency cord has been tucked away behind a bin, inaccessible if you need to summon help after falling over, and there was a big bin in the wheelchair transfer area. Tall stacks of baby chairs often obstruct the way to the toilet. All this is thoughtless and annoying. See my photos.   The red cord must hang freely all the way to the floor - not hidden or tucked away! - so that it can be pulled by anyone who has fallen over during the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back.   The wheelchair transfer area, next to the toilet, is emphatically NOT spare space in which to keep bins or other paraphernalia. It is where a wheelchair user parks.   "
carluccio london,positive,"Tottenham Court Road station is fully step-free street-to-train (Northern Line) and street-to-platform (Central Line - for this line wheelchair users should make sure you inform staff before you travel, as they will need to deploy manual boarding ramps).   Always check the lift status at Tottenham Court Road Station before you travel - the lifts there, although brand new, are notoriously unreliable. This station is referred to by TfL as one of its group of twenty stations with 'rogue lifts', as if somehow it's the lifts that are at fault, not TfL for keeping them in a shoddy state of maintenance.   Absurd to even dream about parking in Covent Garden.   Plenty of bus routes will drop you off a few blocks away in Charing Cross Road or Strand."
carluccios cambridge,positive,"Carluccio's is situated between Cambridge's Grand Arcade shopping centre and Fisher Square. There is accessible parking for blue badge holders in the Grand Arcade multi-storey car park, and limited on-street disabled parking bays nearby in the city centre. Most buses into Cambridge city centre are accessible; the nearest bus stops are situated at the other end of the Grand Arcade, on St Andrew's Street. There is one accessible toilet within the restaurant, with a wide door. The toilet is of a good height, with a fixed rail on the right-hand side and a drop-down rail on the left, with space for side transfer. The toilet is fairly small, and access might be difficult at times when the restaurant was busy, as there is a table positioned close to the toilet door, though this was not in use when we visited."
carluccios london,negative,"Inside the restaurant there were signs for the ladies and gents toilets. When we visited there was a sign on the gents saying it was out of order. I went into the ladies cubicle and it was not accessible, see photo. I then spoke to the staff to see if there was an accessible toilet. The member of staff escorted me to a door next to the counter which said ""staff only private"". There was also a small wheelchair user symbol, see photo. The signage was poor. Going into the corridor it wasn't inviting or customer friendly as there were boxes and a trolley in the corridor. This also may be a safety hazard for some disabled people.  The accessible toilet felt quite cramp as the baby changing table was folded down. There were grab rails and an emergency cord that reached towards the ground. However, the toilet felt a bit grubby and I wanted to get out as soon as possible. "
carluccios london,positive,"Not a huge accessible toilet and some emergency equipment is stored in there which makes it a little bit awkward but reasonable and the entryway is straight into the restaurant but not too close to a table. The restaurant is right inside St Pancras Station, on the level about the shopping concourse. You take a lift from the shopping concourse to the restaurant level. There are two lifts (one of them is towards the other end of the shopping concourse), so if one is broken you have a chance with the other one. Kings Cross and St Pancras Stations have excellent step-free access throughout. At the front of the restaurant is the accessible toilet, which is spacious, clean, well laid-out, and the red emergency cord reaches all the way to the floor and hadn't been tampered with. The restaurant is on the upper floor of St Pancras International Station, so there's is a step free tube station at King's Cross next door and several buses that serve the area. Alternatively you could visit by Eurostar."
carluccios newcastle upon tyne,negative,"There is a wheelchair-accessible toilet, reachable from the back part of the restaurant, and it is fine except for two large bins blocking the wheelchair transfer area. This is very silly and thoughtless. The wheelchair transfer area is NOT free space, it's the place where a wheelchair user parks to allow a smooth sideways transfer to the toilet. See my photo below."
carluccios newcastle upon tyne,positive,"The restaurant is near to Monument Metro station, which - like the whole of the Tyne and Wear Metro network - is fully step-free."
carluccios norwich,positive,There was no accessible toilet.
carluccios oxford,positive,"Many bus routes serve the centre of Oxford, and the railway station is fully step free and less than a mile away.  It is a rare pleasure to be able to award an accessible toilet five stars. This one is absolutely perfect, and very spacious, with nothing blocking the wheelchair transfer area, proper bogroll dispensers, and a red emergency cord which is long enough to reach if you should fall to the floor in the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back.   It is, however, galling to find such a perfect toilet in a restaurant which has such a dreadful barrier for wheelchair users at its front door. "
carluccios sheffield,negative,"Carluccio's, is on a busy road but there is a certain amount of inexpensive on-street parking, especiall at weekends and in the evenings."
carluccios sheffield,positive,"Parking is available on the road right outside the door in a part-time bus lane, which is in operation during rush hour. During these times you can park on side streets. Very clean and good-sized toilet. Car parks all round the centre.  To go to the restaurant choose the cinema/Oasis car park.  Trains, buses and trams stop at the nearby Interchange. Large, clean, grab rails and room for carer. Bit of a sharp turn if you are in a chair. Accessible toilet, larger than average . Grab rails. Alarm cord. Lever taps. Room for carer/assistant."
carnoustie golf club clubhouse restaurant carnoustie,positive,We were allowed to drive up to the door and park alongside the rear of the building. Just opened so maybe designated parking is planned there were 2 disabled toilets on the upper level. reasonable size but the placement of toilet roll holder and hand dryer was better in the ladies one. 
carnoustie golf links carnoustie,negative,I only located 1 accessible loo which was just after I entered the course the only other toilets that I located were at the far end of the course and they were not accessible toilets which was very disappointing.
carphone warehouse exmouth,negative,The store is in Exmouth high street and council parking was used.
carradale bay campbeltown,positive," Very easy to drive there, open a few gates and access to the car park was very easy. Slightly bumpy underfoot but traversible with wheelchair. Access to beach would be ok for a manual wheelchair but our powered one got a bit stuck. "
carraw bed and breakfast hexham,positive,"Reserved space adjacent with hard path leading to entrance  Wetroom with good facilities, toilet raider available  Access by road essential, as fairly remote location. Paved parking area for 3/4 cars Built with disabled in mind, with all necessary space and facilities at required heights etc. a Gravel drive from the road to the 'Lodge', with hard and level paving to designated disabled parking bay Compliant to part M of the building regulations with drop down handrails"
carsington water ashbourne,positive,Toilets in the main building and courtyard.
cart horses winchester,positive,"Several wide disabled spaces right by the accessible door. Really good, clean, lots of space, grab rails, red pull cord that touched the floor."
cart lodge   boundary farm cottages framlingham,positive,"We parked the car outside the door for ease to get my wife in and out, then I just parked the car for the night on the designated parking area. No hardship there for a non disabled car driver. A car is a necessity as the cottage is about 2 miles from Framlingham.     No problem with the facilities grab rails etc. We were offered other stuff but they were not required. It was a wet room which was what we required (and reason we chose this property).   Parking is on grass (not hard standing) across the drive way immediately in front of the cottages.    Spaces are not reserved for each cottage, so where you can park may depend to some extent on other guests but I am sure if you needed to park as close as possible this could be arranged. I have ""a drive chair"" from car and I just had to be a bit careful that my ramp was coming down on the drive rather than the uneven grass.      I would say you need a car to stay at this property as it is very rural and a car drive to shops, eating places etc. Loo in the ensuite is quite low.  Left side transfer.   Grab rails both sides.    I was offered a raiser seat.    There is a second loo in the utility room off the living area which is higher but does not have grab rails.    "
cartwright hall bradford,positive,There is disabled parking at the front of the venue. There is an accessible toilet. There are grab rails on both sides of the toilet and there is lateral transfer space. 
casa cava matera,negative,Matera is a World Heritage Site and is under going a lot of development as it will be the European Capital of Culture in 2019 so a lot of development work is being done so things are likely to change a lot over the coming years. At the moment there are several disabled parking bays (marked with yellow lines) about five minutes walk from the venue (outside of the Sasso). The city is made up of cobbled roads however effort has got into make as much as the city as possible accessible  so it is easy enough (although slightly bumpy) to get from the parking to the Casa Cava and other parts of the city too. It is fairly steep going down the hill from outside of the Sassi.  
casa de colon las palmas de gran canaria,positive,The museum is in a pedestrianised area in the middle of Vegueta (the Old Town). I walked from my hotel so unable to comment about public transport.
casa lago holiday villa foz do arelho,positive,We hired a van from handimanic and were met at the airport. Parking at villa is ideal A car is needed as there is no local transport  There were 2 wet room ensuites. One was larger to accommodate wheelchair user with a choice of shower chairs. There are large parking space inside the property and both floor are directly accessibe from the driveway. Adapted taxis are available locally In the ground floor there is one accessible bathroom. The toilet has handrails.
casa mia dumfries,positive,"Plenty of parking spaces , some adjacent to restaurant. No dedicated disabled parking spaces. Tarmac surface"
casa milagro mojacar,negative,"There was no marked disabled parking as the property only had roadside parking outside of the villa. Although there a 5 toilets wit in the property none of them include handrails and of the two that are on the ground floor, only one would have enough room from a wheelchair to manoeuvre freely."
casa parlante museum corfu,negative,"The museum has installed 2 toilets, I did not use them but I don’t think they were accessible."
casa parlante museum corfu,positive,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced.
cask and barrel southside edinburgh,positive,"Big, clean accessible toilet."
cass sculpture foundation chichester,negative,No disabled parking spaces in the rough surfaced car park (but the staff brought the mobility scooter we borrowed down to the car). Good. But sited in the main building which has a step up on entry.
castle drogo castle drogo,positive,Car park at venue
castle fraser inverurie,negative,There was a sign for one but I don’t think there was a proper disabled toilet and you had to battle through thick gravel to get to the toilets.
castle fraser inverurie,positive,Parking is grand - not sure if any public transportation would go there. 
castle howard castle howard,positive,"Plenty of spaces for parking and lots of disabled spaces. We drove there by car.  parking was near the entrance as you'd expect There was plenty of disabled parking available.  The car park is a long way from the main house, however on-site transport is available once you are in the grounds. There was more than one disable toilet on the site with good access to them all. There is plenty of accessible parking, very close to the entrance area. The markings around bays are so faded they are barely visible but provided everyone parks sensibly, it's fine. The car park is a little potholed so care is needed when wheeling across it. There are toilets in the courtyard but is quite narrow getting in and out and not much room inside. The toilets behind the giftshop were more spacious. In summer, they also had some portacabins dotted around. They could with RADAR locking them though, to help keep them clean."
castle isle bar restaurant helensburgh,positive,"There is a large, flat tarmac area outside the restaurant, although this is not marked for parking so I'm not sure if you are meant to park there. There are several marked parking spaces outside the shop which is close by. The one blue badge space is near the shop entrance, rather than closer to the restaurant. However, it is very little distance from there to the restaurant for those able to walk and easy to push a chair because of the tarmac. There was plenty of space for a wheelchair and assistant. A drop down grab rail and one attached to the wall are very helpful. "
castle semple visitor centre country park lochwinnoch,positive,"There are disabled toilets both inside and outside the centre, both toilets are quite small but both have handrails and staff are always happy to help to show you the way. The toilets do get quite busy in the summer time. Plenty of accessible parking in front of the visitor's centre. Accessible toilets are available inside and outside the visitors centre. Toilets are spacious with hand rails  toilets can sometimes difficult to get access to if the centre is busy. Excellent parking for buses and cars right up to the waters edge. Same as above Large car parking area with disabled spaces. Lochwinnoch has a train station which is 1 mile from visitors centre. There is a disabled toilet. It has grab rails, room for carer and is clean.  The emergency alert cord is not attached although system is fitt Plenty of accessible parking spaces Toilets in main building and another block of outside facilities provided Plenty of disabled bays directly outside the visitor centre, watersports area and cycle route. I used the accessible toilet at the start of the cycle route (which I believe is available April til October) and it was perfect. There is also a disabled toilet in the visitor centre but I didn't see that. Car - Close train station (15 min walk) with 5 accessible parking bays next to the centre it is ideal public transport is not the best but staff are vey helpful  the toilets are easy to find and has all grab rails fitted also their is space for a carer to assist  I drove and parked in one of the disabled spaces adjacent the admin block. Generous amount of disabled and normal parking spaces. Loo was clean spacious and well appointed 5 accessible parking bays close to the main building 2 accessible toilets  available Good parking at the centre Train station is a bit of a walk but not unmanageable Large accessible toilet good for large power chairs"
castle stalker view portnacroish,positive,Disabled Parking at door.    Good toilet 
castleton primary school glasgow,negative,Most of the time access is blocked to the disabled parking bay.
cat cafe manchester,negative,Please see main review 
cat cafe manchester,positive,5 minute walk from Exchange Square. Several accessible bays in street outside. 
cathays central youth community project cardiff,negative,One disabled space nearby on street.  Parking in nearby Lidl if you make a purchase in store. no where to park properly in order to get wheelchair out not safe to move around as its near main road by cars going past.
cattle grid windsor,negative,For the disabled this restaurant is not ideally situated with the only parking space  in nearby municipal car parks about a ten minute walk. 
caulders erskine bishopton,positive,"Modern, spotlessly clean separate disabled toilet with assistance rails and emergency cord.  Toilets in shopping area. there are a number of accessible spaces close to front door The accessible toilet is on right of building as you enter it is accessible but partially hidden by shop.   The space in the corridor is limited  so may require some maneuvering if  multiple mobility devices queue.   "
caulders glasgow,positive,3 disabled parking spaces at the door. You would need a car to get there Great disabled toilet. Has a baby changing fold down table in it but it isn't a problem.  Plenty of grab rails and red cord. The toilets are in the cafe
caulkheads sandown,positive,There is a car park directly by an accessible entrance. The car park seemed level and flat. There did not appear to be a disabled space and it was fairly small car park.  The pub is on the main road into Sandown and there are bus stops nearby. There is a regular bus service to Ryde and back into Sandown and onto Shanklin and beyond. There is a disabled toilet with shared baby changing. The door opens outward. Did not appear to be any alarm and the lock was a simple bolt. There are grab handles but it was still a struggle to get round the toilet. There was plenty of space. To get to the toilet there is a door which makes it a bit tight but I think you can also access it from the childs play area.
cavallini ristorante italiano paphos,negative,"There was street parking outside but no disableb bays Sorry, I did not use them and therreforfe not sure if there was disabled ones"
caversham heights methodist church reading,positive,"2 spaces to rear, one near ramp we didn't find it first time around as off the foyer, not with other toilets, which were signed from the hall"
cawfields picnic area car park cawfields,negative,There was an accessible loo. Basic but had plenty of handrails. Grubby. Broken soap dispenser and broken hand dryer.
cbd plaza hotel caloocan,negative,"No special disabled rooms are available, if required a plastic chair is available to use in shower."
cbd plaza hotel caloocan,positive,"Parking is outside front door. The main bus depot is across the main road, with buses going North to Manila and south to Legazpi and Mayon volcano.  Taxis, tricycles are available by request at reception. New renewed rail station with trains to Manila as is located near to hotel"
cc blooms edinburgh,negative,"Pretty central, there's the omni centre really close by which I think has parking but public transport is the way to go - buses from North Bridge, Princes Street or York Place.  There isn't one so it inevitably cuts your time there short! "
cca centre for contemporary arts saramago cafe bar glasgow,negative,Had to park several blocks away. There's nowhere to park near there and it's a long walk from train stations or underground. I think there are buses that stop nearby but not good for getting there unless you walk or cycle. 
cca centre for contemporary arts saramago cafe bar glasgow,positive,"Good public transport routes on Sauchiehall Street, Charring Cross Station is about a 5 minute walk away. Clean, wide and plenty of space in the accessible loo. There is some on street parking and buses pass along the street as well. There is one on each floor. Best on is the one at the back of the cafe (on the left, second loo). On street parking, but didn't see any designated disabled parking close by Good accessible loo at the back of the cafe. There are others on other floors of the CCA too."
celinos partick glasgow,negative,"Parking is very difficult in Glasgows west end but my father has a blue badge and found a accessible parking spot just around the corner. I traveled by bus from the city center, Dumbarton Road is very well servred bus route. Nice clean accessible toilet"
celinos partick glasgow,positive,We were dropped off just outside the restaurant. There were no dedicated disabled parking bays close by but there is a quiet street just to the side which we used to unload/load into our WAV.  There are a number of bus stops close by.  Partick train station is a 5/10 minute walk away with links to the centre of Glasgow via train or by underground (NB underground not disabled friendly!).   Accessible loo on the lower level of the restaurant.  We didn't use it on this visit but I know from visiting before that it's not too small and will allow access for an electric wheelchair but probably not enough room to turn around in.  
celtic manor resort newport,positive,"I can’t comment on buses, we drove. We couldn’t see any disabled spaces in the car park we were directed to, and our vehicle was too high to access the lower level so we drove round the front and a nice man took our car away and parked it for us, and brought it back when we needed it. Fine in public areas"
celtic park stadium glasgow,positive,Pre arranged disabled parking provides an easy entry to the stadium Toilets for disabled persons only. High level of cleanliness and hygiene
center parcs brandon,positive,Excellent - disabled parking outside your Accessible lodge Inside your Accessible Lodge is an Accessible Bathroom - NO HOIST or CHANGING BENCH
center parcs grange over sands,positive,"There is no driving on site except on Mondays and Fridays to unload and load up cars arrival and leaving. All cars except WAV are parked outside the main forest area. We were allowed to keep but not use our vehicle outside the cottage. A bus service is available for all disabled guests and will pick up and drop off as required, pre-book this in advance as it can get busy!! The accessible toilets are again to a high standard the one in the main shopping mall is a little small and could be doing with a make over but that is a small issue."
center parcs newark,negative,"Only hoist we found was in pool.  Other toilets are the standard ones, nice and clean - but still a case of lying on the floor for us :( many toilets didn't have red cords in them."
center parcs newark,positive,"Great for the Accessible villas - you are allowed to leave your car outside in a flat bay that is just for you.    Main car park is fairly flat and has a few accessible bays.  We struggled dropping off outside our villa as nowhere flat to park and get ramp dismissed. When an accessible lodge is booked, our wheelchair accessible vehicle can be parked very close to the lodge, and left there for the duration. Movement around the site is easy, but wobbly adult & junior bike riders mean that vigilance is needed at all times. Mobility scooters are available to hire. In our 3 bedroom lodge 485 the wet room is very good. Wide doorway, plenty of room to rotate, right hand transfer to toilet with a raised seat. Fixed shower seat with arms or a mobile shower chair. Unfortunately no lodge on site, with a ceiling hoist and/ or a wash dry toilet. Smallest accessible lodge is 3 bedroom, with only one accessible bedroom."
center parcs penrith,positive,"Accessible vehicle available to book for assistance in getting around  Good loos available in accommodation and we used the disabled loo in the bowling bar which was spacious and easily accessed.  We drove to the park and as we booked accessible accommodation had parking at the lodge but not allowed to use vehicles in the park.  A mobility bus can be booked if required also mobility scooters  can be hired as can manual wheelchair  In the lodge great  Didn’t use any on the park but saw signs for them including changing room There is a Blue Badge parking space available outside the Accessible Lodge, however there is no Blue Badge parking near the Village Centre. You can book a FREE Accessible Bus that will pick you up from outside your lodge and drop you off outside the village centre entrance   All toilets were clean & tidy and there were 3 Changing places toilets (Village Centre, Swimming Pool Changing Room & Indoor Sports Centre Complex"
center parcs warminster,negative,"No disabled parking so I had to park in the car park which is about 20M away, they could do with having some dedicated disabled parking for the spa No marked parking bays so no extra space to get wheelchair in/out"
center parcs warminster,positive,Excellent you can park outside your Lodge Staff were helpful and took us to the disabled wet room/ toilet which was clean and spacious. I could have a proper shower after using the spa Parking outside lodge Accessible loos are great 
centraal museum utrecht,positive,"Accessible parking is available at the museum.  If traveling by taxi, the company Accessible Travel Netherlands can make arrangements for you.  The museum is a 25 minute walk from the Central station. Both the main museum and the Nijntje museum have accessible toilets."
central park bar and restaurant middlesbrough,negative,There are a couple of disabled bays across the road near to the Museum / Park but I noticed these were full of cars without Disabled Badges (shame on you !)
central park cowdenbeath,negative,"The toilets are Porto toilet. Even though they have the disabled sign on them, I can't see how a disabled person can use a Porto toilet"
central pier blackpool,negative,Good if you want to arrive by the modern Blackpool Tram. Otherwise it's some distance from the nearest parking or other transport. We walked and wheeled along the promenade to get here. We left using the Tram which was great as they're very accessible. There is an accessible toilet part way along the pier adjacent to the standard loos. Look out for the cartoon characters on the doors! Once inside the accessible loo is very spacious and has the requisite grab rails; albeit there slightly rusting state as another reviewer also noticed. There is very limited parking around this area and restrictions are in place at certain times of the year. The nearest car park is about 10mins away however the trams do stop at the end of the pier There is a Radar Key Toilet on the Right hand side of the pier this is the side nearest the Tower. It was clean and useable however the grip rails on both sides of the toilet its self were rusty and would advice care if using.
centre pompidou paris,positive,"Very central. Buses 29, 38, 47 and 75 will get you there. The website (see above) has details of where reserved parking spaces for wheelchair users can be found.  Clealrly signposted, clean and spacious. Room to side transfer and a good grab rail. There was no alarm that we could see."
chaddesden dental practice derby,negative,There is a car park but no designated disabled bays. There is a bus stop that stops outside (i4 and indigo Trent Barton Buses) stop here. The bus stop on the other side is a 5 or so minute walk away.
chaddesley corbett kidderminster,negative,"Along the wooded lanes to take you to the nature reserve, the only parking spots are along the lane itself, so can be rather full in main season. In Chaddesley itself, It’s a bit difficult to park, as there are many double yellow lines in the village, but if using the Swan inn, a big enough car park is available. Toilets are basic, you may have to get out of your chair to use, but other facilities will be available on other parts of your day trip."
chads cars derby,positive,Door to door service.
chai latte cafe manchester,negative,"There was only one toilet in the cafe which was confusing to find. The toilet area was quite dark, small and cramped. There was a high step before going into the toilet."
chai latte cafe manchester,positive,"There was no parking near as this was in the town centre. However there was numerous bus stops outside the cafe in Stephenson square, Manchester."
chalice well glastonbury,negative,You really need a car to get here as it is on the outskirts of Glastonbury. That said only 3 small parking spaces.
champor champor london,negative,"The staff directed me to a loo with a wide door. They had to move several tables to be able to get my chair to the door. Inside, I found no grab rails at all, not enough space to turn around, the toilet was at standard height i.e. lower than my chair, making transfer difficult, and the basin was at standing height with a cupboard underneath so I couldn't reach the taps. It may have been a large stall but it definitely wasn't accessible."
chance counters birmingham,negative,"One room of nongendered toilets including one disabled cubicle. Main door to this area not large - potentially a challenge to open it. Red cord too short. Cubicle a bit small to manoeuvre in.  The accessible loo has grab rails and door opens outwards but it is very small, not much wider and no longer than the non accessible stalls. Not big enough for most wheelchairs to fit inside, maybe doable with a small manual chair but not much room to maneuvre.  If you are an ambulant wheelchair user, there's space by the sinks where you could leave your wheelchair outside the stall. Total walk from your chair to the toilet would be 2-3 metres.  Sinks are all in a communal hand washing area. The accessible stall also doubles up as baby changing. No alarm cord."
changing places toilet cumnor,positive,"It is next to the VIne Inn carpark As there was only a single length of tracking which needed to go over the toilet, this meant that the changing table needed to be moved into the centre of the room to be underneath the tracking.  But the room is huge so there was still plenty of room for manouevring and handling.   Equipment instructions were provided and also a sheet to fill in so that the parish council know how much use it is getting."
changing places toilet hereford,negative,"There is plenty of disabled parking spaces within a few metres of the toilet, however it is not free or discounted parking for disabled blue badge holders. The only way to get the parking fee reimbursed is to buy stuff in Waitrose."
changing places toilet hereford,positive,Excellent toiletting facilities. Changing bed and sink both height adjustable. Plenty of room for manoeuvring. Hoist facilities and even a wash and dry toilet. Very clean.
chania chania,negative,"Chania has its own airport. I had a very positive experience with special assistance arriving but on the way back they only took me as far as the gate in a wheelchair. When I asked where my support was they said that I had told them I could so stairs and they had taken me via wheelchair to the gate and only offered me the regular shuttle bus. I then had to walk down the stairs and join the speedy boarders on the shuttle and disembark. It was only after one of the other passengers complained that someone came to help me up the airplane steps.  From the airport there are buses. However I took a taxi which took about 20 minutes and cost 25 euros, each way (March 2018). The taxi took me directly to my hotel and from there I was able to walk round the harbour and town centre. On Zampeliou, the street running parallel to the harbour I  found a free public step free, accessible toilet with a single grab rail. If you exit the harbour at El Venizelou Square and turn into the side street next to Star Bucks, and then at the first left side turn you will find the public toilets on the corner. The toilets were clean. Since returning I saw on tripadvisor that someone had posted a photo of the front of another block of public toilets which are near to the Giali Tzamissi mosque and they have an accessible ramp and accessible toilet sign, however I didn't use these during my visit. There is also an accessible toilet in the Arachnology Museum (see separate review) but there is an admission charge. I didn't notice any in the restaurants I visited.  "
channel view leisure centre cardiff,positive,"Disabled Bays up to Reception The accessible toilet was on the ground floor, near Reception.  Can't remember about signage but I asked helpful, pleasant Reception staff "
chanonry point fortrose,positive,"We went by car, we followed the brown tourist information road signs, after arriving in Fortrose, but you really need to keep your eyes peeled for them. Small car park with no dedicated accessible spaces"
chaophraya edinburgh,positive,"Designated wheelchair accessible toilet which is well signposted - only draw back is a heavy door between restaurant and the toilets in general. You'll need to ask the staff for a key to get in. Considering its city centre location, there are accessible parking bays almost directly outside the restaurant. There is an excellent bus service nearby and the tram stop on Princes Street is approx 10  minute walk away. We went on the bus which stops not far from the venue.  The street that the restaurant is on is pedestrianised.  When I went to the loo, one of the staff was immediately ahead of me to open all doors and ensure I was able to get into the disabled toilet with no problem.  The toilet was spacious with a good turning circle, plenty of bars and rails to hold on to and a raised seat.  As soon as I unlocked the door, another member of staff was there to open the doors and ensure I got back to my table with no trouble.  This included asking someone to pull their chair in a bit etc.  So considerate and aware."
chapter cardiff,negative,On busy nights patrons forget the disabled toilet needs to be accessible and move tables and chairs in front of it. One large accessible toilet off cafe area.
chapter cardiff,positive,Several blue badge parking bays in the carpark Accessible toilet is easy to find - its by the other toilets. It is clean and spacious. Room to manouevre and room for a carer There are loads of disabled parking spaces on the road outside.
chard reservoir chard,negative,An eco friendly loo is on sight but we didn't  visit it so unable to comment.
chard reservoir chard,positive,Plenty of free parking in a compacted area next to the start of the walking track.
charlecote park warwick,positive,"The parking is a long walk from the actual house but there is golf cart shuttle service to get you there and you can ask and if available there is disabled parking only closer to the house.   The car park is shingle and where it is compacted it’s easy to navigate. Some areas have deeper , less compacted shingle which is a little trickier.  There are 2 sets of toilets. One by the house and one at the Orangery Cafe.  I only used the ones at the cafe and there was not a designated disabled toilet only 2 normal ones with no grabs bars etc. "
charlestown harbour saint austell,negative,The main car park was very busy and we didn't find a space.  Had to park on the street some half a mile up the hill.
charlie miller edinburgh,positive,"I came by bus and it is level access from the bus stop to the store. Parking situation unknown as it is quite a busy street with a small Tesco next door. The toilet is to the left of the sink area. It does not have a wheelchair symbol on the door but I found it to be very accessible. There is a pulldown handrail on one side and a horizontal grab rail on the wall. There is a red cord on the left hand side of the toilet as you're sitting, however it does not completely touch the floor. There is space under the sink to roll under and two vertical handrails on either side of the mirror."
charlottes ice cream parlour dewsbury,negative,"only a few disabled parking spaces, could potentially be none left on a busy day."
charlottes ice cream parlour dewsbury,positive,There were disabled toilets that were easily located on the site. The toilets were clean and tidy with a scheduled cleaning rota. They also had hand rails and enough room to easily maneuver around the bathroom
charwood edinburgh,positive,"ample disabled parking huge, clean wheelchair toilet"
chase farm shop cafe sutton coldfield,negative,"No accessible toilet, no toilet at all in shop, just men’s and ladies in cafe. It was small in there so difficult for large chairs to turn. It had grab rails and pull cord, and it was very clean and tidy in there."
chase farm shop cafe sutton coldfield,positive,"A one way system round the shop area, with at least 4 disabled bays. But only one disabled bay when you finally get round to cafe."
chateau dapigne le rheu,positive,Disabled parking bay Wetroom bathroom with plenty of space for carer. For those that travel a shower chair - ours did not fit over the toilet.
chatham street resource centre halifax,negative,"The accessible bathroom/changing place is good and has an ok layout. However, it would be nice if there was more than one. There is another disabled toilet but it can be a squeeze to fit in a wheelchair and a carer."
chatsworth house bakewell,negative,"Free blue badge parking is the closest parking to the entrance however it's still a short way. We asked where the largest disabled toilet was and found it rather small. I think I tourist attraction of this size and with the price of entry there should be a changing space. Disabled parking  a long distance away from the main building and was with the normal parking. There were no proper disabled bays marked out which meant that cars had parked close together so you could not get in and out of your car as a wheelchair user. it was also on stones and uneven surface with a slight slope.  They have a huge flat area nearer to the house which they could even use barriers to make a wheelchair parking area if they put some thought into it. They have one disabled toilet- not well signposted as it is not where the other toilets were when i came out of the house. The disabled toilet is large and clean, it also had a grab rail, unfortunately a large bin had been placed at the side of the toilet next to the arm rail so a disabled person in a wheelchair would be unable to transfer from a wheelchair  to the toilet as  you couldn't get to the toilet and due to the size I was unable to move the bin. Suitable for the wheelchair to entre.  Adequate grab rails, easy access to sink and dryer.  Includes baby change fascility.  However the toilet seat moved and was not secure. There are spaces  but you have to ask for directions to them, the parking is on grass Terrible not easy to find nearest loos to entrance for ladies are up stone steps no ramp no rails"
chatsworth house bakewell,positive,"Disabled parking closer to location They won 'Loo of the Year' in the past so you cannot fault their toilets. Clean, accessible. However this next comment is for All Attractions, a Changing Places toilet would be THE best facility ever as it opens up a world of opportunities to 250,000 people who cannot stand and use a standard accessible toilet . They need hoisting so without a CP outings are SEVERELY limited. Special schools,nursing homes day care, groups etc always have to choose somewhere with changing and hoist facility The parking seemed further away than I'd been led to believe, not sure but maybe blue badge holders could part nearer.  Also was uphill!"
chelsea bridge london,negative,"Disabled toilets in Battersea Park nearby, signed well."
cheltenham a wyevale garden centre cheltenham,positive,5 disabled parking spaces near the entrance. Disabled and baby changing toilet. There are grab rails with a sink and mirror at wheelchair height.
cheltenham racecourse prestbury,positive,Went by car there is a lots of spaces as it is a very very big carpark. The disabled toilets are good. They have two on the ground floor and one upstairs. The space is decent as there is one handrail on one side and you are able to get a hoist in there too
chepstow garden centre chepstow,positive,We went by car so cant comment on public transport.  Plenty of disabled spaces near the front door
chesford grange kenilworth,negative,"We only found public ladies and gents, with small cubicles, no sign for disabled.   Public toilets are ok We did not find disabled toilets, just public, and these were beside lounge by the bar. They were just plain basic cubicle tiled toilets, no grab rails or pull cord. You will not get chair into cubicles though."
chesford grange kenilworth,positive,"You arrive by driving through the barriers and then To use the disabled  car park for the Spa, drive to the right of the hotel entrance and down the slope, and a large car park can be found, but no disabled bay, with entrance to Spa through a double pull handle doorway, it’s on the level at this point. Or you can choose to get to Spa through the main hotel reception area, as photos show you, with the need to use lift to go to lower floor level. Remember to get the pass number from staff for barrier to lift up, to get out of hotel parking spots.  The Spa and health club have facilities that include a swimming pool, heated loungers, and a steam room.  The Gym has a number of latest equipment for you, and has either received or is supposed to be getting an upgrade as part of a multi-million investment across 18 health clubs. As the group has so far done very little to improve the hotel since they took it over, we will have to wait and see what they may do for the Spa. They like so many Spa’s today seem to be concentrating their efforts on the Elemis skin and care treatments, which include Well being massage, hot stone massage, Frangipani body wraps, then they have their facial treatments to help improve your facial looks, which includes a relaxing face and scalp massage, which may help to take away tensions and leave you with a radiant skin look. Ladies, you may have your manicure treatment here, file and polish nails, on hand or foot, and of course your eyebrows. Go for it gal ! Following a drive through countryside around Warwick, you arrive at the Grange, and entering via a barrier you find the disabled bays in front of you by the hotels entrance. When going to exit hotel, pick up the pass number required to lift barriers from reception desk. It’s free for those who use their facilities."
cheshire cheese inn vancouver,negative,A marked space around the corner at the end of the street Not at all unless you can walk
chesil vista holiday park weymouth,positive,"Park next to accommodation.  Loo accessible (unisex Radar key) good space for carer to assist. Clean, grab rails and easy to find. Monitored by security so only used by those meant to use it!"
chessington world of adventures chessington,positive,There is disabled parking right near the entrance and if you are staying at one of their onsite hotels then you can park at the hotel but it’s a bit father to get to the park entrance. You do have to pay for parking which in my view is outrageous they do provide express parking but it’s more expensive.  Fantastic toilets facilities they have a changing places toilet with hoists and changing beds.  They were a good size with grab rails Excellent - Changing Places Toilet with bench and hoist http://www.chessington.com/explore/theme-park/facility/84/disabled-changing-places.aspx
chester town hall chester,positive,"Parking was on public streets in Chester, directly outside. The streets are semi pedestrianised with some cobbles but plenty of drop downs. Chester Bus Station is in the next street for public transport links.  Disabled loo on the ground floor, clearly signed on the door, but I had to ask to find it on the first attempt. It has plenty of space, grab rails and a lower level washbasin. Good hot water and paper towels. It is always beautifully clean and sweet smelling."
chester zoo upton,positive,"Plenty of disabled parking. Show your badge to the parking stewards as you enter the zoo and they will direct you to the disabled parking bays close to the zoo entrance.  There are accessible toilets which are clean and tidy and have grab rails. There are 100 disabled parking spaces in the zoo car park that are only a short distance away from the main entrance, allowing easy access into the zoo. To easily locate the accessible toilets and changing facilities, you can find them on the map that is given to you at the main entrance of the zoo. There is a changing place facility inside the jubilee toilets. This provides a height adjustable sink and easy access hand rails and hoist for easy use. Drove straight in and parked by the entrance in one of several rows of accessible bays. Free to park. Firm Tarmac surface.  The monorail is accessible to power chair users but not scooter users. There was only a very small lip and gap to board (level) which I hardly noticed. Carers ride free. The boat ride I didn't do but a wheelchair user was on board the flat deck of an accessible boat in the Islands. There is one changing places toilet in a modern toilet block, clearly signposted. It's near the Jubilee monorail station and main food hall. It doesn't have a privacy curtain but does include all the usual features and ceiling hoist. A shower is included. There are modern standard wheelchair accessible toilets on the Islands - they should really have had a second CP toilet too as this section could take you 2-3 hours alone if you do the boat as well. I tried two other toilets (Jaguar house (small) and at the end of the Komodo dragons (old/tiny). Chester Zoo has 100 disabled parking bays at the front of the car park closest to the main entrance to allow easy access to and from the zoo. This car park is tarmac and therefore suitable for wheelchair users or those with visual impairments.  Buses are available to/from Chester city and train station, these operate on a regular basis and have disabled access. However there is a longer walk to this stop from the main enterance All toilets have disabled access however there is only one toilet in the zoo which includes a changing place facility (Jubilee toilets). In here there is a height adjustable sink with a soap dispenser, automatic paper hand towel dispenser, and a warm air hand dryer.  There is also easy-access hand rails and a hoist.  All accessible toilet facilities are shown on the map (free on arrival) 100 spots, however all were taken so arrive early! (Blue badge only). Brilliant and one with bed, shower, raising sink, hoist and so on. Disabled parking space filled up early on a very busy day but we still managed to get close to the main entrance once we showed our blue badge. Lots of well equipped disabled toilets."
chesterfield town centre chesterfield,positive,Plenty of disabled parking bays in most places. Bus stop at both the upper and lower halves of the town allow access. The train station is not easy to get to if you have difficulty walking.
chesters by the river ambleside,positive,There is free parking next to Chesters but it can get VERY busy at times.  Good toilet with grab rails and space for a wheelchair and a carer.
chesters roman fort and museum   hadrians wall hexham,positive,"We arrived by motorhome and parked easily in the coach parking area. There was plenty of parking available, including blue badge spaces. Parking is free for members but you have to display your membership sticker in the window. There is one accessible toilet in the shop. It is right in the corner and some Roman shields had to be moved to let me in. The doorway was too narrow for my trike but was fine for my normal chair. It was clean. It had a RADAR lock but mostly was left open and staff used it (e.g. cafe staff). "
cheynes edinburgh,negative,Bus stop right outside but not good for car parking as on a main road out of Edinburgh City centre. I can't comment on the toilet because I haven't used it. I know there is one on the same level but it isn't accessible in a wheelchair or scooter.
chianti restaurant polmont,positive,Blue badge spaces immediately in front of the entrance.  Everything on the level. plenty of parking 
chicken shopdirty burger london,negative,It is street parking near the shop
chicken shopdirty burger london,positive,Very good access to the disabled loo

chimes forres,positive,Nearby free parking with disabled bays. 
chimichanga restaurant lincoln,negative,"Parking at Lucy tower council run car park with a number of bays. A short 200m flat roll away. Good size toilets, left transfer for wheelchair users- bit naughty as store children's chairs and boxes in there!!!"
china buffet king renfrew,negative,The disabled parking at Xscape is good with plenty of spaces available.
china exchange london,positive,"Nearest tube stations are Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus neither which are step free. Nearest step free tube is Green Park and then bus no 14, 19 or 38 to Shaftsbury Avenue. China Exchange is on Gerrard Street, the main street in London's Chinatown. It is pedestrianised from 12noon to 6am, with the nearest drop off point is Macclesfield Street. They have accessible toilets on each floor. The toilets are spacious and clean, with grab rails. Sorry I can't remember of they have an emergency cord. "
china red edinburgh,negative,"No parking outside venue - only a drop off point.  Public transport is available but a walk will be incurred. Good, clean, well appointed toilet but difficult for chair users because of that narrow turn."
china town buffet elgin,negative,Parking on the high street however the disabled car parking is quite far away.
chippenham surgery monmouth,negative,A few bays nearby which are on uneven ground with a lot of pot holes. Nearby Waitrose store only has a few wheelchair bays. Either way access is via a cobbled 'cut through' unless approaching from main road Door does not close with a standard wheelchair inside. Door stiff and stuck so unable to open. Only one rail one side of toilet and no room to transfer from wheelchair
chips 2 go porthcawl,positive,Only upside to the place is that it's easily accessible from all directions with parking close by and walking paths from all beach sites
chiquito ashton under lyne,positive,"There is a tram stop nearby behind the cineworld but I have not tried to use this so can't comment on accessibility. I don't believe a bus stop is particularly close but again I've not tried to get the bus here.  Parking was easy and was able to park nearby, there are lots of disabled parking bays. Not sure how busy this gets."
chiquito harlow,positive,"The place is accessible by car. The railway station is about 1/4 of a mile away and there are always taxis. There are disabled spaces right outside the door of the restaurant. As said before, the toilet was clean and accessible, but no ""Changing Places"""
chloes chinese restaurant paphos,negative,To be honest I did not look to see if there was an accessible toilet or not.  O know the 'normal' ones were upstairs
chocolate theatre cafe bar windsor,negative,You can easily access this cafe from the riverside car park or Eton station ordown the hill from the Windsor station.
christiansborg palace copenhagen,positive,"The palace is in the city centre. There are a number of buses that stop nearby. The metro and buses in Copenhagen have designated spaces for wheelchair users. Their website says that ""Disabled parking space is available at the Bertel Thorvaldsen Plads (by the entrance to the Thorvaldsen Museum)."" There is an accessible toilet on  the 1st floor of the Royal Reception Rooms, by the Queen Stairs. It was spacious, clean and had grab rails. It didn't require a special key and there was no emergency cord.  The website says that there is also an accessible toilet in by the ticket office and entrance of the Ruins. However, I didn't use this.  There is no accessible toilet in the stables."
christies chemist fochabers,positive,You can park on the high street so very convenient plus there is a bus stop 100 metres away so very convenient!  
christies garden centre fochabers,negative,There is a disabled toilet but it is on a slope so it may be difficult if you have a manual wheelchair and the toilets are really tight.
christies garden centre fochabers,positive,"Plenty of blue badge spaces at the entrance. The recent addition of a Changing Places toilet is good. However it's locked and a radar key doesn't work. You have to go through the shop to the till to borrow a key, the leave out the exit, return through the entrance to get back to the toilet. The lock is very stiff so I then had to find someone to unlock and relock it. Once inside it was great. It should either not be locked, be radar key compatible or have a doorbell to alert staff to bring the key. The garden centre has its own car park with several disabled car parking spaces available. "
christmas market at east princess street gardens edinburgh,positive,"Ample access opportunities whether it be from Railway Station, bus or taxi all less than 5 mins from the Market area. Ample parking in Market, Bank and Cockburn Street. All significant bus routes travel past the Market and stops are available throughout the area of the Gardens, the nearest Tram stop is at the Mound, the trams and bus stops also link directly with the Princes Mall, St Andrew Square and George Street Market area which are part of the same Market theme, but over 4 locations.  Just across the street from Edinburgh Waverley station, excellent bus and tram links. There are accessible toilets on at least two levels of the market and there are toilets within the nearby art gallery too. Many buses and close to Waverley train station. Huge and spacious with necessary rails and red cord. I traveled from Fairlie to Edinburgh by train and the market itself is a five minute walk from the station. I booked assistance in advance for help with the ramps on the train. This help was provided but I didn’t get the luggage assistance which I also booked until we got back to Glasgow. This made the journey more challenging. Accessible toilet is located within a portacabin to the side of the market. It had plenty of space inside however the emergency cord was tied up "
christmas market at st andrew square edinburgh,positive,"There is no parking in St. Andrews Square during the event but plenty parking in the adjacent Streets, especially after 18.30 when the pay parking restrictions end, the Tram stop is on the East side of the Square plus 4 bus stops with a wide range of services, for buses from further afield, the Bus Station is near the Tram stop. Waverley  Station is 5 minutes away below Princes mall."
christmas market at waverley mall edinburgh,positive,"You are literally on top of Waverley Station, there are 2 bus stops on either side of Princes Street and there are 20 services available both within the City and from other parts of Lothian, Borders and Central Scotland. Parking is available on all the adjacent streets and the Tram stop in St Andrew Square 5 mins away. There are pay to park restrictions up until 18.30, there are also ample taxi ranks in the area."
christmas market at west george street edinburgh,negative,I travelled by taxi but there was still quite a walk from the closest taxi drop off area to the attractions. 
christmas market at west george street edinburgh,positive,"Edinburgh’s first rate Tram and bus services are within 3 minutes, there is ample parking in adjacent Streets, the pay to park scene ends at 18.30 and is not in force on Xmas or New Years Day."
church dundee,negative,No disabled toilet
church dundee,positive,The venue is in the centre of town so great for buses. We were able to park right outside!
church farm barns   norfolk disabled friendly cottages bircham newton,positive,"Each property has their own parking spaces for at least 2 vehicles outside the front door, which is paved so easy to walk on or wheel yourself in your chair to the cottages. At least one of the toilets, if not both, in each property we have stayed in have grab handles to allow easy and independent transfer from chair to toilet Good parking but would need own transport. Loos accessible through bedrooms  - the property we stayed in is very small but space used well. The yard around the cottages is gravel but there are flagged paths so you can get around. You can park outside each cottage. No bathroom could be perfect for everyone but this one was a proper wetroom, really spacious and with plenty of grabrails, a free-standing showerseat or a commode shower wheelchair if you prefer.   I think most of the cottages had paved parking right outside. The toilets and bathrooms were very good. In my cottage there was a wet room and bathroom, both with accessible toilets. Both had plenty of room to move about in. I think you can hire shower chairs and other equipment for your stay. Flat with hard standing but some newly laid soft gravel was a bit tricky in places Plenty turning space in main bathroom and small toilet is manageable if needed A cut about the rest. Basic and good to go, all aids available. Plenty of space to park, and able to load , unload onto paved area. beyond that the  Surroundings are gravel."
church farm shop ltd norwich,negative,There doesn't seem to be designated disabled parking slots but there is a fair sized parking lot. Its not tarmac and has a slope and is a little uneven in places. My scooter coped quite well though . There is an accessible disabled toilet in the car park accessed by a ramp and it looked like it needed a Radar key. I didn't use it because half the ramp was covered in a pile of fallen rotting leaves that in wet or frosty weather might have been a real trip hazard. A good sweep would solve this issue easily. 
church hill theatre edinburgh,negative,A number of buses stop right in front of the theatre (going into town) or close by (out of town).  Parking  is slightly more challenging
church hill theatre edinburgh,positive,"Accessible parking just outside FIne once we found it! Again the public transport is excellent to and from the City, ample parking on Churchill and surrounding streets,  I saw or saw signs to an accessible toilet but didn’t use it."
church of our lady of the rock of france puerto de la cruz,negative,"Although the church itself is on a level, padestrianised square, the surrounding streets slope. A taxi should be able to park on the level, close by."
churchill square shopping centre brighton,negative,Only one and was locked. Couldn't find anyone to open it for me.
churchill square shopping centre brighton,positive,There are bus stops right outside
churchill war rooms london,positive,There's loads of public transport options to get close by. I went by bus and scooter.  Good unless you need to transfer due to bins.  We were staying in Southbank so it was a walk/wheel to Westminster and then the Churchill War Rooms are just round the corner. Westminster is an accessible tube station with the Jubilee line. There is plenty of public transport nearby. There are also plenty of tourists so sometimes you can't get about as quickly as you would wish!
ciampino rome,negative,"We took a taxi to and from the airport, but there are shuttle busses that will take you to the city centre for around four euros. Everything is very clearly signposted to show you where to queue for different modes of transport. There can be a significant wait for the shuttle busses if several planes have arrived within the same hour."
ciao bristol,negative,parking spaces available outside in denmark street - if you have blue badge there are often spaces on yellow lines
ciao bristol,positive,disabled loo just behind bar/kitchen area
ciao italia dunfermline,negative,"Two disabled parking spaces to right hand side of restaurant. Additional parking at rear. Spacious, but used as a storage cupboard."
ciao roma edinburgh,negative,"It is possible to park on one of the side streets nearby, but not outside the front door."
ciao roma edinburgh,positive,Good size toilet. I had no problem with my wheelchair. Limited space at the side of the toilet which may be difficult for some
cinema city norwich,positive,There are 2 disabled parking places opposite the cinema and an area opposite where you can park using a Blue badge as well as a multi-storey car park within about 500 metres.
cineworld ashton under lyne,positive,"Parking was easy and there seemed to be plenty however we only visited on weekday afternoons when it is quiet so I can't comment on parking at busier times.  There is a tram stop behind the building but I've not attempted to access this so I can't comment on accessibility.  There is plenty of disabled parking areas allocated around the building, this being on the front and around the back. however there is no back entrance to the cinema and this could be difficult for some individuals to travel all the way around the cinema to gain access. There is a metro-link station near to the leisure park, however no bus services that stop on the park. The disability toilets are situated in various areas around the cinema and are all very accessible with large amounts of room to manoeuvre inside in a wheelchair or a mobility scooter."
cineworld bolton,negative,"There was an accessible toilet which was easier for the two of us to use. However, in a power chair, it would probably be a lot tighter for space and harder to manoeuvre "
cineworld cambridge,positive,"There is Blue Badge parking on the ground floor of the multi-storey car park on the Leisure Complex site, and also a few spaces outside Cambridge Junction, across the piazza from the cinema entrance. These are all operated by NCP, and there are no concessions for Blue Badge users. Accessible buses from the city centre and railway station stop near the cinema. There are two accessible toilets: one in the cinema foyer on the first floor, and one in the corridor leading to the screens. Each has drop-down rails and space for side transfer. The doors are quite heavy, and are not RADAR-key protected, so we have at times found the toilet in the foyer being abused."
cineworld castleford,positive,"At the complex of where the cineworld is, there were lots of car parking spaces. There are plenty of disabled parking spaces very close to the entrance of the venue, making it easily accessible. We found that it was very well signposted on the motorway when getting closer and then signposted from the junction to the complex. The paths from the car to the entrance were all flat. There were lots of disabled toilets located on the same floor as the cinema and close to the screens to allow access. Within the toilets there were a red pull chord which was labelled in the case of an emergency and there was also grab rails in the correct places around the toilet. There was enough space in the toilet to move the wheelchair around and also for a friend/carer to stay in the toilet if needed. The toilets were reasonably clean and tidy."
cineworld cinema wakefield,positive,There are allocated disabled parking spaces at the entrance to the cinema.  Disabled toilets clearly sign posted. Grab rails on the wall and very spacious. 
cineworld cinema weymouth,positive,They don’t have their own car park as such but there is a disabled parking area opposite the Harbour and there is multi-story parking behind the cinema whereas after a certain time of day Cineworld customers can park for free at the moment wether it’ll still be the same in the future I’m not sure and they have disabled spaces in the multi-story car park.  They have 2 disabled toilets available which are beautifully clean. 
cineworld cinemas edinburgh,negative,"Decent bus service, the Lothian 22 or the 1 is handy, but coming back into the town at night, the 22 bus stop feels a bit isolated. The pay-as-you-go parking garage below is more or less a must for drivers in terms of accessing the cinema with convenience, but I didn't feel safe there. I had one incident with some intoxicated youths in the parking garage. I had another unprovoked incident with a very aggressive driver. As far as the cinema goes, the washrooms smelled of methane or ammonia during all of my visits. The food was relatively poor quality and parts of the business (e.g. bar area) are worn and ugly by current standards. Generally fine but again a bit too small for people with power chairs"
cineworld cinemas edinburgh,positive,"Good having an accessible toilet in the mens. Lots of large disabled parking spaces on each level of the car park. Big enough for a large electric wheelchair at a diagonal angle. Plenty of disabled parking and access into main complex is via push button operated doors and then lift up to cinema floor. Toilets are a good size and always clean. We normally don't take the car as we live close by, but when we have there are plenty of disabled parking bays in the car park. With automatic doors to enter Fountain Park and lifts that go up to the cinema level. Lots of room and have always been nice and clean. We parked underneath the cinema and it was close but more space is needed behind the car. Good but more space is needed to be a five star! Again BUMPS !!! Far too many of them around !!! Very unpleasant and causing unwanted discomfort for some !!! There is plentiful parking in the multi-storey attached to Fountain Park and there are fantastic bus links. There is a disabled toilet in the main hallway and if this one is occupied out of order staff are happy to accompany a female into the male toilets to use the additional disabled toilet there."
cineworld crawley,negative,"Appalling. There are 3 disabled toilets- all incredibly small and totally unsuitable for anyone who cannot walk/needs to be assisted in changing. You cannot fit a wheelchair/buggy and a carer in the room. As a carer I have had to leave a wheelchair outside the door and lift a child in order to change them on the floor which is unacceptable. Several visits the toilets have been blocked and the bathroom unclean. It is also a babychanging facility so often used by families. There is a nappy disposal bin and grab hand rails. No hoist or changing bed (no room!). They have about 3 disabled toilets which are also (as per usual) baby changes.  They often have water all over the floor and the sanitary bins often stop the bar from working safely.  There is nothing to stop able bodied people from using them and I often find them engaged only to find someone who didn't want to queue for the other toilets coming out of them.  I know there are hidden disabilities but the guilty face and ""the queue was really long"" comments give them away as not needing the disabled loos!!!"
cineworld crawley,positive,Blue badge parking available. There are disabled toilets on each floor. You have to be able to transfer to the toilet. There are no hoists or changing tables.
cineworld dundee,positive,"There are plenty of accessible parking spaces at the side of the Cineworld building which isn’t too far from the entrance. There are also a few accessibility parking spaces in front of the Cineworld building too, as well as many standard parking spaces.  I don’ know much about the public transport in this area of Dundee. However, there is a bus stop about a 5-minute walk away which goes from Blairgowrie to Dundee bus station. Then Dundee bus station is a 10-minute walk to Dundee train station.  There are two identical accessible toilets in Cineworld at either side of the building. Each of them are a standard accessible toilet however, there isn’t that much space though if a wheelchair user needs assistance from someone else. The toilet is more to the right-hand side of the space which means that people would struggle if they had to transfer at that side, and there is a big bin at the other side of the toilet which would probably need to be moved. The emergency red cord was successfully hanging free when I visited, I hung a red cord card on it to still spread awareness.  There is no Changing Place toilet at Cineworld however, there is one in the play park at Camperdown Country Park across the road at the back. I’d say a 10-minute walk away or a few minutes driving in the car. As I mentioned in my previous review there are lots of parking spaces outside the entrance to Cineworld, including plenty of disabled parking spaces. There is also a bus stop which is about a 5 minute walk away from Cineworld and I think it comes from the town city center of Dundee."
cineworld edinburgh,positive,Lots of blue badge spaces on level 1 and 2 of the car park and the lift is usually pretty quick as there are escalators for everyone else.
cineworld falkirk,positive,"Lots of disabled parking in front of the venue as well as in front of all the other shops on the retail site.  The door was quite heavy, but all rails and a red cord were present. Functional Loads of room and easily found. Hand rails, clean , tidy and if you need it there was space for carer."
cineworld glasgow,negative,"Plenty of parking in silverburn shopping centre car park, you do have to walk right through the centre. Hubby is in a wheelchair and finds it claustrophobic when the centre is busy to get through the crowds. OK when quieter though.  We drove, not sure about public transport. I believe there are accessible toilets on each level. The accessible toilet on our level was quite small. Once inside the loo and the door was closed, it was a struggle for my companion to lift me safely due to the lack of space between my wheelchair and the toilet. There wasn't any space for turning either. There was an emergency cord and it was hanging all the way to the floor. It would be nice to see a changing places toilet in this cinemas especially as it's such a large cinema.  No disabled parking near by There is not a lot of space for a transfer from wheelchair onto the toilet. The general space to have your career in was not good. It was clean and smelt ok. Parking is hit and miss but if your lucky you can temporarily park at the front ...ideal for offloading the wheelchair Cineworld has no official parking, however this venue is situated in the middle of town. It is right opposite the bus station and surrounding shopping centres have disabled parking available which are not far from entrance. Cineworld doesn't have a private car park however there are public car parks nearby."
cineworld glasgow,positive,"Buses are frequent and go into Glasgow and surrounding areas. Parking for disabled is abundant in the multistory car park and outside  Disabled toilets in the cinema and outside in the shopping mall all disabled toilets are of a good size  and clean  Loos in foyer and also outside screens We parked in the nearby multistorey carpark which was only a few minutes walk away. As the cinema is located in the busy city centre, it may be difficult to find a parking space on the street nearby, but you may be lucky and find one. There is also Buchanan Bus Station across from the cinema and the shopping centre (Buchanan Galleries) has parking too. Don't have large changing facilities It had space for taxi drivers to drop us off. Toilets are usually clean unless your unlucky enough to be in one directly after someone with poor hygiene... happened to us a few times  Easy to find, and very clean. Toilets are on every floor and are checked regularly. Disabled toilets are available.  Large carpark as part of the Silverburn shopping centre so there are lots of disabled bays. There are plenty of accessible parking at this Cineworld with it being located in a shopping centre and they are fairly close to the entrance.  I'm not from Glasgow so cannot comment on the public transport but, I did see bus stops nearby which looked like they came from all over Glasgow. The accessible toilet is fairly spacious however, I feel there isn't much space to transfer at either side of the toilet. It is close to the wall at one side and there was a bin at the other side, although this can be moved. See image below.  As far as I know there isn't a Changing Place toilet nearby."
cineworld hull,positive,There were disabled parking bays at either side of the entrance with a ramp. Disabled toilets down both corridors were both easy to find due to lit signage. Large inside with emergency pull cord and grab rails.
cineworld nottingham,negative,"No parking at the venue but plenty available in the surrounding streets, also various forms of public transport (including trams!) However arrival is best on foot."
cineworld nottingham,positive,Toilets are numerous and easy to access.  Large and clean - the only drawback being that they are somewhat tricky to get into.
cineworld sheffield,positive,The cinema is situated in a entertainment complex so has a big car park with multiple disabled parking spots but there is 18 disabled parking spaces in front of the cinema to make accessibility easier.  The foot paths are also flat and wide to allow easy wheelchair use. There were many disabled toilets located within the cinema on all floors and near all the screens to allow easy access. Within the toilets there were identifiable pull chords in the case of an emergency and there was also a variety of grab rails in the correct places around the toilet. There was also space for a carer in the toilets if needed.
cineworld wakefield,negative,"Disabled toilet located at each side of the cinema. They are on the lower level of the two, meaning you could potentially need to use the ramp, this is something to bare in mind if you need assistance. 'In case of emergency' red cord within reach from the disabled toilet, grab rails placed correctly within the area around the toilet for stability. Enough room to move wheelchair around, as well as enough room for carer as well (if needed). Toilets reasonably clean and tidy. "
cineworld wakefield,positive,"There are numerous disabled parking spaces, close to the entrance creating easy access for customers. The paths to the venue and around the carpark are very flat which is easy for wheelchair users and visually impairment customers.   "
circle nottingham nhs treatment centre nottingham,negative,Red cords in all toilets ties/cut at shoulder height when standing. Red cor cards left.
circle nottingham nhs treatment centre nottingham,positive,"Accessible by car,tram and bus. Very well accessible."
citizenm hotel glasgow,negative,"There is on street parking available, but it can be difficult to find a space at times. There is a bus stop directly across the road, which is handy. The road surfaces around the hotel can be quite uneven in places, so take care."
citizenm hotel glasgow,positive,"The loos are spacious enough, with the grab rails and space that I needed. There is an accessible loo on the ground and first floor areas which house the hot-desking and the cafe area. "
city art centre edinburgh,negative,"Next door to the station. Some on street parking but very busy. Getting along the pavement from the end of Waverley Bridge a bit chaotic, but once at the door, great. On the positive side it was modern and clean.  However by the time me and a carer and chair were in there, it was very cramped.  Made it a really unpleasant experience and got very hot I. There."
city art centre edinburgh,positive,"Clean, modern and space to turn Fully appointed toilet which also has Radar key access and changing places status, clean with servicing record which was up to timescale. Conveniently located right next to the back entrance of the station. Might be a bit tricky to get parked nearby though. Generall found the toilets to be a bit grubby Parking near the City Art Centre is limited. There is some on street parking and Blue Badge holders may find space on yellow lines. The Art Centre is immediately outside the Market Street entrance of Waverley Station, so is good for trains. Buses don't stop nearby and you would probably have to walk from Princes Streetwhich is about 500 m. An accessible toilet is available on the ground floor adjacent to the shop and cafe. It has a wide door, grab rails, and lowered fittings."
city chambers edinburgh,positive,"Great! We were at the City Chambers for an event and were able to reserve a parking space right outside. However, for general visits I'm not sure if you can do this. There are a couple of bus stops nearby though. Great - clean & spacious."
city cruises london,negative,No car parking at all! Some of the more modern cruisers have disabled like but by no means all.
city hall salisbury,positive,Local shopmobility parking is close enough. There are also a few disabled bays on site. Easy access to a single small loo
city hallsold fruitmarket glasgow,negative,"I traveled in a taxi to this event, you can be dropped off immediately outside Queen Street, High Street and Argyle Street train stations are within walking distance.  There are regular buses on the Trongate and Glassford Street which are nearby the venue. There is an NCP car park on Ingram Street and Albion Street.  The accessible toilet is close to the balcony area. The toilet doesn't have a RADAR lock which would be good because as I went to use it I saw five girls all go into the accessible toilet at the same time because there was a small queue for the ladies toilets. I ended up having to leave without using the toilet because they were taking too long.  "
city hallsold fruitmarket glasgow,positive,"Easy to get to. Very clean. We found nearby on-street parking and used our disabled blue badge. The location is quite handy if arriving by train with Glasgow Queen Street station only a 10 minute walk away and Central Station around 10 – 15-minute walk. There is an NCP on Ingram Street which is right at the venue. The car park has an amazing street art mural so it definitely stands out. I would normally travel up to Glasgow by train however as there was disruption on the railway I drove up by car with the help of my Mum. We parked in the St Enoch Centre car park which was ideal as it is open air and so no height restriction. Only thing is you have to have the right change availabile for the car park meter. Alternatively you can call Ring Go from your mobile and pay over the phone. Telephone number on parking meter. There are also also accessible and changing places toilets available within the St Enoch centre. It's near Glasgow Queen Street station so convenient to get to. Not sure where the nearest blue badge parking is nearby. Clean, tidy and spacious."
city of arrecife arrecife,negative,If you find one it should be adequate but basic. Most I have visited have had good circulation and side transfer space. Rails either side of loo but they don't do red cords. If you can travel over rough cobbles there is the loo with the best view in Europe by the castle by the sea. 
city of arrecife arrecife,positive,"If arriving by cruise ship there are shuttles and taxis into town. Shuttle buses drop you half a mile out of town. Taxis get you closer. Walkable or wheel able if you can manage one and a half miles. Smooth path all the way but to get through dock gates you will need to go in the road, no dropped kerb (kribbie if you are from Dundee. )"
city of bath bath,negative,Driving around Bath is generally difficult.  We were lucky on our visit to find disabled parking spaces near places we wanted to visit.  There are a number of larger car parks with disabled spaces
city of bath bath,positive,I used accessible loos at various places in the town - all were adequate
city of malaga malaga,negative,"They were not so easy to find, a wheelchair guide really needs to be provided. Starbucks and museums had facilities as did a few beach locations."
city of malaga malaga,positive,"Buses are accessible and wheelchair accessible taxis are available, just speak to the hotel concierge. From Marina access was great. Did not drive or use local transport.  Used loo at City Hall and Marina. Access good, Spain tends not to have red cords. "
city of schagen schagen,positive,"This city can be accessed by train and by transit buses.  There are also taxi companies who can accommodate all needs.  There are also various accessible parking options within the city.  On Market days, it can get a bit crowded, so be sure to arrive before 10.  The company Accessible Travel Netherlands can assist with transportation and lodging arrangements. Accessible toilets are available at locations around the city center, and there is a collection of restaurants that are easily accessible with a wheelchair.  Some of these locations include the Bibliotheek, the Slothotel Igesz, Mikados shopping center, Rumours bar and cuisine, Linke Loete restaurant, and McDonalds (located a short distance from the train station)"
city of vienna vienna,negative,Parking rules are complex. If you go at the weekend park in zone 1... its free with blue badge in street bays. Different zones have different rules. Do your research about where you wsnt to visit... most stuff is zone 1. We didnt see many disabled loos.  Best head for a public building or restraunt. We used the one in the parliament builbing and it was great.
city of wells mendip district,positive,Parking in Wells is limited - we used large public car park near the town centre - all disabled spaces were taken at the time of our visit but this was not a problem There is an excellent disabled loo in the cathedral cloisters
city screen york picturehouse york,positive,"There are two disabled toilets in situ outside the main toilets; plus disabled toilets inside the main toilets.  All with good lighting, good space for manoeuvring, and equipment in place that's appropriate, i.e.. wash basin is lower."
city sightseeing glasgow glasgow,positive,Pretty easy to go from Queen Street station and find the bus in George Square. On street parking or usual city centre parks. If you have a car start your tour at the Museum of Transport where there is ample free parking. 
city toiletten berlin,positive,"Not applicable The CityToiletten are on street level. The cost is Euros 0.50 but if you have a Eurokey (the universal key for accessible loos in Germany, Austria & Switzerland) admission is free and you can (once inside) occupy the loo for up to 40 minutes. They are equipped with grab rails and alarm buttons. Flushing is automatic and happens after you leave."
civic centre pay and display car parks poole,negative,"When we arrived in the car park, we were shocked to find they charge all disabled people unless they have registered their car a month before visiting, this has made disabled pay when they never used to!"
clacton factory outlet clacton on sea,positive,Very large car park which has wheelchair friendly lift access Dedicated disabled toilets accessed using Radar key - spotlessly clean
clapham junction railway station london,negative,"There is only one accessible toilet, on the raised concourse above platform 17. It's often grubby. The red emergency cord hangs in a remote corner and dangles behind a rubbish bin: it is, therefore, absolutely useless, completely inaccessible to anyone who falls to the floor. This is a mind-bogglingly silly piece of design. See my picture below. There is only one accessible toilet, in fact I think it is the only public toilet on the station.  It was just about usable with a large powerchair with a user able to manouevre himself into position.  It was clean but in one of those old cubicles that somehow never feel completely clean.  Better than nothing but really such a busy station should have much better facilities for all - the toilet is often used by parents with children who have nowhere else to go."
clapham junction railway station london,positive,"Absurd to try and park nearby. But the area is rammed with buses all the time, and zillions of trains pass through the station every day. Used the bus to access from Charing Cross hospital.  Certainly easier and quicker to get to than Waterloo from there and buses less crowded too.  Usual problems with London bus disabled access but no specific problems."
clare lodge holiday centre newcastle,positive,"There is limited disabled parking, but the staff will reserve you a space if you ask There are ensuite wetrooms in every bedroom and the accessible loo on the first floor is just in front of the reception. "
clarks leeds,positive,Within the White Rose there is many spaces reserved for disabled parking near entrances to the centre.
clarkston library clarkston,negative,"If you drove you could easily reach the library however if you took the train or bus, there would be a few raised platforms in the path, but there is mostly just ramps or flat ground once you get off the footpath and onto the direct path to the library. Was clean and accessible, not specifically able to fit carer."
clava cairns inverness,negative,Clava Cairns is set away from the main Inverness to Elgin road and requires visitors to negotiate a labyrinth of country lanes; becoming single track as you get closer to the monument. It’s a place where public transport doesn’t call so you do need your own means to get there.   The car park is small and created with an impacted pinky orange gravel. Not without a few puddles it’s good enough to be able to wheel around fairly easily. The parking is random with no clearly defined bays. Choose your spot carefully if you need side access to get you wheelchair into the car. 
cleopatras wrexham,negative,"Disabled toilet available, though due to it being an old building the route to the toilet is quite narrow and toilet quite small. Larger mobility scooters and chairs might struggle. Euans Guide red cord card left with them to attach. No change facilities. "
cleopatras wrexham,positive,There is no specific parking but there is plenty of roadside parking close to the venue in the village. Parts of the pavement are accessible though alighting a kerb might be required. 
cliffs pavilion southend on sea,negative,"Car park was full, so couldn't use disabled parking."
cliffs pavilion southend on sea,positive,Disabled parking right outside the door Big enough loos for wheel chair access and well maintained
cliftonhill stadium coatbridge,negative,There is some parking in the streets around the ground and there is a car park with in the ground its self. There is a charge for this but it is free to Blue Badge holders. The car park can be accessed via East Stewart St.  It should be noted that the car park area is not that large but it is ideal for the size of the club. There is an accessible toilet next to the disabled access area it can be found by going past the club food outlet area. The toilet is basic but again for the size of the club is ideal
climbzone paisley,positive,"Coming by car is easy, Soar/Braehead is just off the M8. They both have their own large car-parks, with many marked disabled bays.  The car-park is immediately outside Soar.  Coming by public transport might be more difficult. There are buses to it, but I haven't used these. There are accessible toilets within Soar (where Skypark is). The main Braehead centre, which is next door has accessible toilets plus a changing places toilet. We did not use any of these on our visit."
clintons glasgow,negative,Parking is reasonable at Braehead with a number of disabled parking on the upper and lower level.
clober farm glasgow,positive,"There are 2 parking spaces right outside Clober Farm at the front door, this means that it is easier for wheelchair users to get access to the house. Especially if the weather is bad.  Due to not knowing about this area of Glasgow I can’t really comment on the public transport, however there was a train 10 minutes away from Clober Farm.  I visited the SEC Glasgow whilst staying and it was roughly a 30-minute drive from Clober Farm to here. It is also roughly the same amount of time to the city centre of Glasgow. There are two toilets in Clober Farm, a bathroom and an en-suite shower room that is connected to the bedroom with the ceiling tracking hoist. Both are very spacious for wheelchair users, there is an adjustable sink and an emergency red cord freely hanging beside the toilet in both.  In the shower room en-suite there were 2 shower/toilet chairs for visitors to use, they are for adult sizes which is too big for my height, but with a bit of improvisation I managed to use one of them.  Unfortunately, the ceiling tracking hoist did not go through from the bedroom to the en-suite, which means the wet shower chair had to be moved into the bedroom. This was not a huge problem, however it would have been easier if it did go through."
clober farm milngavie,positive,"There are 2 spaces at the front door. We did not use public transport so cannot comment. Spacious wet room with height adjustable wash hand basin. Good turning space. Choice of 2 shower chairs. Grab rails at shower, sink and toilet."
clockwork bar and restaurant glasgow,negative,Car park was being used for more outdoor tables so had to park in the street in a busy area with lots of tenement flats.
clothing4 schools burton on trent,negative,"There was no disabled parking, it was what looked like an abandoned yard, full of hideous pot holes,.. Made the whole trip a frightening experience, being unsteady on feet, with all the issues that a stroke has,   "
cloverley hall christian conference centre cloverley hall,negative,"One of the toilets has an open plan, so is easily accessible. However, the cubicles are small. There is one disabled toilet which is usable for someone in a wheelchair. However, for a child with a complex disability, there is no space for a carer or two to toilet or wash the child."
cloverley hall christian conference centre cloverley hall,positive,"There are no specific spaces designated for disabled parking, however, there is a large car park, and spaces are generally bigger than standard. There is also the option to park outside of a specific parking space if it was needed."
club moativation solihull,positive,"Car park very handy for spa and gym, just remember to REGISTER YOUR CARE"
clumber park worksop,negative,There weren't a huge number of disable parking spaces - we had to go to the more remote end of the car park to find a non-disabled space. 
clumber park worksop,positive,"We always drive to Clumber Park. There is car parking, including blue badge spaces, though these tend to fill up quite quickly. We often bring our motorhome, and park it in the coach bays, usually along with several others. It is a short walk from the car park to the visitor centre. There are several accessible toilets in the park. The toilets on the other side of the lake (our halfway stop) aren't accessible. I usually have to go anyway, and struggle in with a bit of help from hubby. At the moment, the main accessible toilet is closed but there is one in the discovery centre, which is probably better anyway. My only real complaint is that the nappy bin can only be opened by foot and isn't close enough to the toilet, so changing big adult pads is a bit tricky. Oh, and they have that toilet paper that is so thin that it tears off as soon as you touch it, so getting enough out is a struggle. I didn't use it but there was one so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt!"
clyde community hall glasgow,negative,Very hard to find subway near by but not accessible 
clyde community hall glasgow,positive,Plenty of Buses come from various locations along Paisley Road West and also Govan Road. There is also a Subway Station around about 10mins walk away.   There is an accessible Loo at this centre and it has plenty of room to move around in and a low sink to use. 
clyde shopmobility clydebank,positive,They are guaranteed parking for disabled people in front of the shop and the bus stop and the bus train is' three minutes by walking There is an accessible bathroom for people with mobility problems
clyde walkway and millennium bridge glasgow,negative,We used taxis to take us to the  Tall Ship and then walked along the riverside path on our exploring. It's probably easier to join the path at the SECC or BBC plaza.
clydebank town hall clydebank,positive,"I parked in front of the entrance for people with disabilities and I immediately found the room, easily accessible thanks to a wide corridor. Toilets were accessible and close to the room, easily to find and very clean."
clynfyw farm boncath,negative,"We parked outside a door. Could not see parking facilities but also no reception or staff around. lots of parking spaces but not much local transport. All the loos and bathrooms are accessible as far a I can remember. If you have particular needs, explain them to Jim and he'll be happy to place you somewhere suitable if he can."
co op food derby,negative,The parking was limited. There was a car park around side too. The accessible bays appear wider but aren't very well marked.  Disabled parking is limited. I4 & Indigo trent barton stop near by.
co op food derby,positive,Disabled parking bays outside both entrances of the store. I4 & Indigo (Trent Barton) stops a few minutes walk away. 
co op food fochabers,negative,No disabled parking near the shop and Fochabers is usually pretty busy so you may have to park far away.
co op food shetland,positive,"Fantastic parking directly outside the store with lots of spaces available. The accessible loo had everything I needed, but there were some issues with the red cord being tied up. It was tied up pretty tightly and after about 10 mins I had to give up. There was also a strange sign on the wall next to the red cord which was obviously intended for drivers, which read ""should you require assistance, please sound horn""."
coal grill bar exeter,negative,"The loo was fine, once I'd asked 3 people to move as the restaurant had two tables in front of the disabled loo!?!?"
coal grill bar exeter,positive,Plenty of parking spaces as this is the city centre.
coast coffee anstruther,negative,"Some parking bays outside though on a busy weekend I'm sure they will be constantly full.  There are two public car parks just along the road, both have a good number of disabled bays. Really tiny.  They had added a handrail by the door, but there was hardly any room to move."
coast port glasgow,negative,"Limited Disabled spaces, infrequent public transport"
coast port glasgow,positive,Roomy with good facilities 
coast rosslare strand rosslare,positive,Arrived by car from Rosslare ferry terminal. Disabled parking bay directly outside main entrance of hotel 
coast to coast norwich,positive,Plenty of parking in a nearby multi storey. Excellent.
cobbs aviemore,negative,"Aviemore on a busy Saturday is not an easy place to park. There are a few disabled parking bays but they were all taken. We were lucky as a parking place right outside the venue became available, but had this not happened the walk from the car park would have taken me about five minutes."
cockenzie house gardens cockenzie,negative,I travelled on the 26 bus which stops close by.  There is some on-street parking beside the walled garden but no accessible parking marked. I visited at 11am before it was too busy on this sunny morning. 
cockenzie house gardens cockenzie,positive,Parking is at the rear and on street. There are toilets on most floors. I saw two on ground level which were large enough for wheelchair access and had bars.
coco gelato cardiff,negative,No parking and difficult to park on the road.
coco gelato cardiff,positive,"The loo is very easy to find. The door to where the toilets are located is heavy and does not open electronically. Once inside the accessible toilet is left unlocked so no problem if you don't have a radar key and users are spared the indignity of having to ask. The toilet was very clean. There is a baby changing shelf but not one suitable for an adult. The red cord was in place and reached to the floor. I can't comment on parking as I don't drive but there is a bus stop close by and buses on this road are very frequent. I didn't use the accessible toilet but it was easy to find and unlocked. There was no handle on the outside so the gentleman who wanted to use it couldn't open it himself so I spoke to manager Dave about this. He said that, within a week of opening, someone had ripped off the handle.  The cafe has only been open for a few weeks and he is planning to install a bar with which people can open the door themselves. Last time I was here I spoke to the manager. I said the loo was great but there was no handle on the outside of the door. That has been remedied. I only give 4.5 because there is a door which needs to be pulled open before entering the are where the loos are. I was pleased that, although there is a Radar lock on the door, the door was unlocked so anyone who doesn't have a key doesn't have to ask for one."
codebase edinburgh edinburgh,positive,"CodeBase is just behind Usher Hall which has great bus links, also close to Princes Street with bus and tram links. There is also a car park across one road which charges. Some roads and crossings are a bit bumpy for wheelchair users so not the smoothest journey if you’re unsure where to go. The accessible toilet is the first one on the right. It has enough room for myself in a powerchair and another person to help. The red cord is to the floor and is hanging nearer the door than the toilet itself. Handrails are on both sides of toilet and mirror. Good turning space for wheelchairs and the door opens outwards."
coffee affair inverness,positive,"I parked in the eastgate centre and then walked to the coffee shop (About a 2-minute walk!)  This venue is in the centre of town and there is on-street parking very close by which was free at the time I visited, however, it was a shockingly wet day and it might not be available in better weather being right in the town centre.  There are also a few car parks fairly nearby at Eastgate Centre and  The Bus station for example.  Again, being in the town centre, it's a few minutes away from the train station and the bus station so it's quite easy to get to. This toilet was clean, accessible and spacious.  It had a red cord within easy reach and grab bars.  The door was wide and manageable and there was plenty of space to manoeuvre inside; I know that sometimes when the accessible toilet is shared with the changing area it can be pretty messy with overflowing bins of nappies etc. but this was not the case here and it was really good."
coffee angel edinburgh,positive,"Decent size, doubles as baby change. No red cord."
coffee co dundee,positive,There are various disabled parking areas and car parks in the city centre so parking is as much the same in any city. No problem with access. Absolutely spotless.
coffee republic bracknell,positive,"This is a town centre location,  & has no parking. However there are near by car parks only a short distance from the venue.  There is a disabled toilet, which is to locate & with good access"
coffee1 bath bath,positive,The cafe has parking (including disabled parking) right outside the front entrance. It is about a 20 minute walk from both Oldfield Park and Bath Spa railway stations. It is right next to the cycle path. It is 5 minutes from a number of bus stops. These are situated to the back of the cafe.
coffee1 cardiff,negative,There is no disabled parking. There is no car park. It is very difficult to find a parking space in this area. There are bus stops nearby if you can use the bus or you can be dropped off by taxi. No problem with the loo itself but it is reached via a step. No ramp. Plenty of room inside.
coffee1 cardigan,positive,"The parking is in a public car park or on street parking. The disabled bays are spacious and Ceredigion Council offers free parking to tax exempt vehicles. The unfortunate thing is there is a steep hill to climb to the main high street where the coffee shop is situated. There used to be a lift, but the shop in which it is situated at the back of, is currently closed and up for let. "
coffee1 lichfield,negative,To cramped and also a baby changing room. No room to turn chair round 
coffee1 lichfield,positive,Car park next door 
cohens chemist bristol,negative,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest to Cohens Chemists is the Council owned parking approximately 200m away on Mizzymead Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
colchester zoo colchester,negative,"We visited two toilets. The first one was inside an exhibit, but for some reason had a ridiculously steep slope leading up to it. I doubt anyone in a wheelchair could make it alone, and with no handrail my husband needed my assistance to get to them safely. The actual toilet was dark and cramped."
colchester zoo colchester,positive,"Several disabled parking spaces very close to the main entrance. There were plenty of disabled parking spaces near the entrance on a reasonably good surface. I understand another reviewer wasn't keen on the accessible loos, but the one I went to near the lorrikeet house was clean and spacious, with enough grab handles."
coldingham bay eyemouth,positive,Impressed with the parking set up. You come first to the main car park where there are 3 blue badge spots. If you carry on down the steeper tarmac path it is signposted for emergency and blue badge traffic only. There are two spots at the bottom here right next to wooden platform. Even if these are full it’s still worth checking as you can use the area to drop off disabled passengers.  There’s a dedicated accessible loo with a radar lock - but we didn’t check it out and presumed it was closed due to Covid.
coleton fishacre kingswear,positive,"On the same level as the entrance, plenty of space for wheelchair and carer. Usual facilities."
colfin creamery stranraer,positive,"We travelled by car, it is quite remote ( an old farm/ creamery as the name suggests). Plenty of parking right at the door, and more up the side of the building. The parking up the side is on a slope which had slight implications for the wheelchair, I would have struggled to self propel my chair  Accessible loo easy to find, clean and fresh, lovely decor Plenty of room to manoeuvre  wheelchair and turn full circle Plenty of room for a carer One drop down rail to left of toilet, I found this difficult as I need to push up with both hands to get off toilet, perhaps repositioning the adjustable rail to the right hand side of the toilet and a grab rail on the left hand wall, would provide more assistance for wheelchair users I had to move a bin & toilet brush to get to sink, but that was a minor issue. However I had to use my wet hands to turn my chair to dry my hands on the towel which was hanging on the door behind me, the towel hook could do with being a couple of inches lower for wheelchair users to use."
coll bunkhouse isle of coll,negative,The CalMac ferry over from Oban seems to be a bit disorganised we arrived at 6 am after a long drive and there were no toilets open until 7:15 at the check-in. The ferry company has done it's best to make the ferry covid-19 safe. The return ferry from the island had a very steep access ramp and I was lucky I had a strong person to push although help was available from the ferry company The parking at the bunkhouse was completely flat and wheelchair accessible
coll bunkhouse isle of coll,positive,There is parking right outside the Bunkhouse. There is no public transport on the island. The loo is fully accessible with grab rails. It is in the shower room specifically for wheelchair users The wet room and disabled toilet was well equipped lots of grab rails and and a shower chair to sit on lots of space
collective edinburgh,negative,"I walked up from the entrance beside Greenside Parish Church off Royal Terrance, this is a steep slope and took me just under 5 minutes to get up. At regular intervals drainage is across the path, this could be tricky for some people.  Latest bus stops are on London Road, or regent road."
collective edinburgh,positive,"It's actually very good once you know how. Walking up the hill by most of the paths requires negotiating steps. If you are looking for level access then it is a trek up the access road. The gates are directly opposite St Andrews House in Waterloo Place and you can be taken up by a taxi and dropped off. Blue Badge holders can drive up the access road and park outside the Collective at the top of the hill. Take care driving up the road as it can be busy with pedestrians who may not be expecting vehicles to be using the road. If like me, you are a wheelchair user, you can wheel up and down the road but it is a fairly steep gradient going up - I required the assistance of a willing helper to push me; but it was achievable. Just reward the accompanist with coffee and cake when you get to the top! The Collective has three accessible toilets. All modern, reasonably spacious and well appointed. The first is in the main observatory just by the entrance, the second in the restaurant and the third in the main gallery. Conventional toilets are available under the restaurant and are signposted from the main pathway. If you are a Changing Places Toilet user your nearest options are the ""Booking Office"" Wetherspoons pub on Waverley Bridge or the Scottish Parliament. There are toilets below the restaurant called The Lookout, however there is a step up to them.  However in the restaurant I noticed there was an accessible toilet. I did not use the restaurant or that toilet. Parking is available for blue badge holders and I believe you could also get a taxi to take you up the hill. For those not bringing a car, it is a steep climb with steps or via the road. Once at the bottom of Carlton Hill there are lots of nearby bus stops and a short walk to Waverley Train Station. The accessible toilets were clean and tidy and everything looked new and in good working order."
collosseo restaurant doncaster,positive,"A large car park to the side of the building with plenty of parking and disabled bays are marked.It is about 30 minutes from Doncaster train station by foot,it is also on a bus route but not to sure which one."
colosseo metro station rome,negative,"I passed a large accessible loo on the landing of the stairs. However due to its location, it is not particularly accessible as wheelchair users would need to use the stair lift to access it, and it wasn't the largest of stair lifts."
colston hall bristol,negative,"No designated parking but we can always find a spot on the double yellow lines on Colston Street just up from the hall, with the blue badge.  There is a multi storey car park over the road (I think blue badge holders have to pay) which is a short way down a steep road (Trenchard Street). The roads in Bristol are a complete and utter mess at the moment, so I'm not sure how easy it would be to get parking near this venue. I walked from the centre of Bristol, and even that was stressful due to the poor consideration for disabled people during these works. Many pavements are uneven and so difficult for cane and wheelchair users to navigate."
colston hall bristol,positive,"Toilets excellent but if in the Lantern you'd have to take the two lifts mentioned above, and go through a corridor (with a bit of a thick carpet) and past the bar which is a bit of a long way.  If in the main hall downstairs there's a disabled toilet off the opposite side to the entrance which is not signed at all (and it's up a sloping corridor but still the quickest option). No parking at the venue. But plenty of on street parking and car parks close by. We weren't sure about something and saw a parking warden. He was extremely helpful. Very accessible. A bit scruffy."
columba 1400 cafe isle of skye,positive,"We drove. It was well signposted. Two blue badge spaces in a level car park Toilet had rails and was big enough to get a wheelchair in, just."
columbia coffee lounge scunthorpe,positive,"2 hours free parking is available in all of the council car parks around town. There are four situated around the town centre. There is also parking on the side streets, which is usually free for 1 hour."
colwyn bay railway station station square,positive,Just outside station doors
comfort foods inverness,positive,Situated on a pedestrian street. There are some disabled spaces further along this street 
comicrazy paisley,negative,Current plans in place to make more accessible for wheelchair users
commemoration hall huntingdon,negative,I parked in Princes Street car park which is very close by and level. Blue badge parking is available.
commemoration hall huntingdon,positive,"There was one disabled toilet next to the cafe. The only negative is the door is heavy and on a tightly sprung hinge, so it takes a few goes to get in. The toilet is newly refurbished and the decor is lovely. There is a red emergency pull cord that reaches the floor. There are rails and plenty of space. A small sink isn't ideal but does allow for better use of the space. There are paper towels for drying your hands. You don't need a radar key for this and the lock is actually disabled friendly as it has a long handle and not stiff. "
commune of ars en re ars en re,negative,I only used the toilet in the restaurant. It had one grab rail and no emergency alarm. I have given the rating of 3 only because I'm unsure if there are any other accessible toilets in the town.
commune of ars en re ars en re,positive,"I travelled to Ars en Re by bus. The no 3 bus travels from one end of Ile de Re to the other. The stop for Ars en Re is on a by pass, s 5 minute walk to the central square. The buses are coach style, with 2 doors, the front door by the driver has a sign for people with walking sticks, it's doable but has quite deep coach stairs. The middle door has a wheelchair sign. "
commune of les portes en re les portes en re,positive,"The no 3 bus's final stop is Les Ports en Re, it's a small village. The bus is a coach style with wheelchair accessibility. When you get off the bus it is a 5 minute walk into the main part of the village. There is an accessible toilet in toilet in the car park next to the bus stop and tourist information office. the toilet had 1 grab rail, no emergency alarm and the toilet seat was missing. However it was clean."
commune of loix loix,negative,La Route du Sel  had a toilet but it there was a step to get to it and there were no grab rails in the toilet. I'm unable to comment about other toilets in the village.
commune of loix loix,positive,To travel to Loix requires 2 buses. The main no 3 bus doesn't go to Loix so you have to change from a coach style bus to a smaller bus which takes you to the outskirts of the village. Both buses are wheelchair accessible. From the bus stop it is a 5 minute walk to the village square.
commune of saint martin de re saint martin de re,negative,"Musee Ernest Cognacq had a disabled accessible toilet, with one grab rail and no emergency cord. Likewise the restaurant Le Marco Polo. The one grab rail, often raised toilet and no emergency alarm seemed to be typing of accessible toilets during my holiday."
commune of saint martin de re saint martin de re,positive,"I used Béatrice Taxis from La Rochelle and on the way there I was in a people carrier, on the return trip I used the same taxi company and they had got me a people carrier with a pull out step, which made it easier to get in and out. The driver was extremely helpful and took my luggage into the hotel. Alternatively there is buses which run throughout the day connecting Ile de Re to La Rochelle. The nearest bus stop is Saint Martin de Re Le Port and it is a 1 minute level walk to the Port. In the Spring - Autumn if you are driving to access the port area requires a code, which your hotel should give you and there is a charge for the car parks. There are direct flights in the summer season from Gatwick to La Rochelle with an actual flying time of 1 hour 10 minutes."
community cafe forres,positive,"Their is one parking place for blue badge holders outside the building and a generous car park at the back. There is a bus stop within 100 metres There is a spacious,  accessible loo in the Community Centre adjacent to the cafe. Easy to find and well signed"
como lounge witney,positive,Nice & clean. A little difficult to open door to get out.
compton verney art gallery park stratford upon avon,negative,"The doors are manual, very heavy and difficult to operate from a chair. It’s clear they haven’t been tested by wheelchair users. "
compton verney art gallery park stratford upon avon,positive,"There is a shuttle bus running from carpark to house which is a 5 min walk. Disability parking at the house Disabled loo easy to find, rails to use ams plenty room Bus stop outside but hard surface needed by stop.  Large car park but blue badge users also  allowed to park at the House. Transport from the Welcome Centre to the House instead of walking is not fitted out for wheelchair users which isn’t  mentioned. Ground floor loo  to Part M standard including Euan’s card on the red cord!  Baby change inside toilet on the ground floor but plenty of room. Accessible toilets now on other floors but not visited. Once you have purchased your tickets at the booth in the car park, automatic gates allow access up the drive right to the front of the house for disabled parking. Main disabled toilets are off cafe on ground floor but there are also facilities available on the Mezzanine level. Car park changes made and provision of a Shuttle Bus on demand for wheelchairs, mobility scooters and a tail lift that someone can stand on for access to the bus too if unable to use the steps.  I was dropped off by taxi which then waited for me in the car park.  I returned to it using the Shuttle Bus but the House staff would have radioed the Welcome Centre to send the taxi back to me too if I had asked.  There is a bus stop outside, Johnson's No. 6 that runs between Stratford upon Avon and Banbury. Previously commented and Euan's card installed, no changes needed. Parking available in the main car park or next to the gallery if that is preferable. The driveway between the car park and the gallery is wheelchair accessible and it is a pleasant and scenic 10 minute walk in fine weather Large well designed loos with grab rails and plenty of space. We have always found them to be clean and well maintained with clear signage"
comptons of soho london,positive,"The nearest step-free station is Tottenham Court Road, which is just a few blocks away, and several bus routes will drop you near Cambridge Circus, which is a few hundred metres away. Beware: Tottenham Court Road Station is fully step-free to train only for the Northern Line. For the Central Line, it's step-free to the platform but not to the train - shame on TfL for this omission."
comrie croft crieff,positive,I drove and there is an accessible parking bay close to the entrance of the reception and cafe. There is an accessible loo at the Kata which was ideal for me. It has been raised slightly to make it easier to get on and off the loo.
comrie to st fillans walk crieff,negative,There is a small amount of parking available at the start of the walk just off the main A85 in an area called Dalhonzie.  The ground is as nature intended and there are no marked bays or particular disabled parking.
comur a conserveira de portugal faro,positive,"We walked, and the shop is about a ten minute stroll from the bus station. Frequent pedestrian crossings."
confiserie ballanger nice,positive,Ballanger is located on the main shopping street with Tram Line Number 1 running past it. The tram is the easiest way to get there as it is step free and the Massena tram stop is the nearest although Jean Medecin tram stop is also nearby. 
congo rapids jurassic adventure golf norwich,positive,"Large car park, disabled spots near the entrance although they don’t have the blue badge sign , they are marked by wall signage. Part of the car park is well packed stones and part tarmac. Toilets are accessible and there is a disabled toilet but I can’t say what’s available as I didn’t use it."
conifox stables bistro edinburgh,positive,"Well signed, designated blue badge parking separate parking area, with plenty of additional blue badge spaces in main car park as well.  Good sized disabled toilet, contained changing table for babies which considering this venue is super popular with families might lead to a queue"
conisbrough castle conisbrough,negative,"Private, charged car park is unexpected and unwelcome. Buses from Doncaster and Rotherham stop in the village. Upon arrival my colleague and I had difficulty finding the general car park due to the sign being unclear, however the car park for disabled users was much easier to find as it was near to the visitors centre. The visitors centre/ gift shop was very easily accessed, it was spacious, plenty of light and very well laid out."
conisbrough castle conisbrough,positive,There was a new accessible toilet that was easy to reach but no changing places facilities.
conishead priory ulverston,positive,"There are 2 disabled spaces adjacent to the priory near the cafe. A ramp leads into the priory itself. The disabled toilet is elsewhere in a courtyard leading to the Buddhist Temple. Ample room to ride my scooter in, plenty of grab rails "
connaught gardens sidmouth,positive,"Sidmouth doesn't have a railway station. The 9 or 9A bus from Exeter takes about 35 - 45 minutes and stops at the Sidmouth Triangle. There are other local bus services that go to Sidmouth. In the summer season the Sidmouth Hopper Bus stops at various points of interest in the town, it is step free and has a space for a wheelchair user. From the Sidmouth Triangle, where most of the buses stop, it only takes a couple of minutes to the step free entrance of Connaught Gardens. It's from the same point that you can pick the Sidmouth Hopper to take you back down the hill. There is an accessible toilet which requires a radar key. It is spacious and has grab rails."
connaught theatre worthing,negative,We were dropped off outside the theatre because there wasn't any parking close enough for me to navigate with my sight loss and mobility scooter.
connaught theatre worthing,positive,Large car park next to venue ( pay & display)
contini george street edinburgh,negative,Someone disabled parking available on George Street and surrounding streets. But it is a busy area.
contini george street edinburgh,positive,"I scootered there & got a taxi back. There is parking in George St, which is the location of the restaurant, and plenty of buses nearby so overall easy to get to.  Accessible toilet is on small side. It is quite narrow & there is not room to turn a mobility scooter. There is a drop down rail on one side only.  The other side has a low ledge next to the wall.   There  is an  accessible disabled toilet on the ground floor which has an emergency red current cord. See photo"
conwy castle conwy,negative,"public car parking, not close to castle disabled toilet outside visitor entrance accessible to all"
coopers bar restaurant alloa,positive,There is a car park but no designated spaces. It was quiet on a wet Tuesday evening so could park close to the entrance. Spacious with suitable rails and a red cord that reached the floor. Bin may need to be pushed aside for transfer but there’s space for that.
copacabana beach dubrovnik,negative,"Although we did not drive ourselves, we were able to see that the carpark, although small, was on a level ground that would accommodate wheelchair users to smoothly get from the parking space to the concrete pier on the beach, from there they are able to access the pebble path that leads to the restaurant, WC and water-sports activities. However from what I could gather, there was no obvious spaces allocated to disabled parking, Making it uncertain whether there would defiantly be a space upon arrival.  I was unable to see a disabled toilet at Copacabana. Although the regular toilets were fairly easy to access (ie. no step) once in the building there was little space, I would imagine a wheelchair user would struggle with the lack of space and also the quality of these toilets was poor. For one of the busiest beaches in Dubrovnik I would also believe that only having 2 female toilets is not enough. "
copenhagen copenhagen,negative,Museums and places of interest tended to have accessible toilets. However the only public toilet I noticed when I was outside was at the King's Gardens (see separate review). The accessible toilets tended let to have grab rails with legs and no emergency cord.
copenhagen copenhagen,positive,Flight time from London to Copenhagen was about 1.5 hours. From the airport there is great accessible public transport. There are trains to take you travel across Denmark or directly to Sweden. There is also the metro and within 15 minutes you can be in Copenhagen's city centre. 
coppa club henley henley on thames,negative,"Being in the centre of town, there is no dedicated parking but parking is available in a public car park just 5 minutes away. "
coppa club henley henley on thames,positive,There is no Changing Places toilet. The wheelchair accessible toilet is a good size for entry and turning around in a wheelchair with sufficient grab rails and is very clean. 
copthorne hotel cardiff,positive,"There are 2 designated places, which are always in use. I tend to drive up to the main entrance then park ensuring I'm not blocking the entrance of course. Put my blue badge on."
copthorne tara hotel kensingotn,negative,There is some disabled parking but it seems time-limited. We didn't have a car so I am not sure of this. Accessible loo on ground floor but it could be situated closer to the restaurant. 
cora london,negative,There are not enough reserved parking spots so you have to park on the far side of the lot. The lot is shared with other stores so it is very busy and may be intimidating if you are on your own because it is hard to see over the cars.  There is only one toilet per gender and if someone is in there with children you will wait for quite a while. This is a very popular restaurant so plan your bathroom visit well.
cora physical therapy coral springs,positive,Handicapped parking is right in front of Cora.
coral island blackpool,negative,The Tower tram and bus stops are only a few minutes away on the prom there is no parking in this area as it is a very busy area. There is a car park across the road from the venue on the south side behind a open air market. We did not look at the Car park on this visit however it is run by the local council show should have Blue badge spaces available There is only 1 accessible toilet in this large venue and it is located in one corner in the in house café. The toilet is located near to the service counter.  It is a standard basic toilet and very disappointing that there is only one toilet in a venue of this size . There was a sign pointing to the accessible toilet but it did not give a clear location.
corfu airport corfu,negative,"The new accessible toilets, see photo, were clean and spacious, with grab rails. There was no emergency cord, no soap, no hand dryer and no mirror. I did go next door to the ladies, just to see if all the new toilets were incomplete. In the ladies there were a row of sinks with soap and hand dryers. I felt as a disabled person I was a second class citizen as basic toileting facilities were missing."
corfu airport corfu,positive,There are flights from UK airports direct to Corfu
corfu old town kerkira,positive,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced.
corfu taxi private tours corfu,positive,This was a private taxi tour so I was collected and returned to my hotel.
corfu walking tours corfu,positive,"I booked a private tour and was offered the option of Arina, my guide, picking me up from my city centre hotel. "
corinium museum cirencester,negative,"Wheeled in my chair.  The Museum recommends parking at the Old Station Car Park.  Outside of the Museum is a drop off point. Public transport will be  in Cirencester itself, about a 5 minute walk away, though it is flat and pedestrianised."
corinium museum cirencester,positive,"Large accessible toilets, clean, large enough for a carer and easy to manoeuvre."

coro the chocolate cafe edinburgh,negative,"As its on Frederick Street, there's not really disabled parking but it's well serviced by the buses on Princes Street "
corrie golf club tearoom sannox,negative,No accessible loo on site. Staff will provide a key to the church across the road which has an accessible loo there. 
corrie golf club tearoom sannox,positive,Excellent. There are 2 accessible parking spaces right in front of the tearoom.
corrie hotel corrie,negative,No disabled loos and main Ladies floors slippy and getting up off the toilet is difficult. Small cubicles. No room for wheelchair 
corrie hotel corrie,positive,There are no disabled bays but ample to the side. If you need space for ramp you won’t get it. 
corstorphine railway path edinburgh,positive,"Can't comment on parking. The path starts from Balgreen Tram stop, which is also served by Lothian's bus #38. Once through the Paddockholm estate a short walk up Station Road brings you to St John's Road, Corstorphine, from where there are frequent buses back to the city city or westwards (Lothian 12, 26 & 31)"
cosaig self catering innerleithen,positive,"We had no problems with disabled parking at all , The local buses are an excellent service and they are Wheelchair friendly. No Problems at all Parking right outside cottage for one car Faultless for access in the loo and wet shower room.  Parking right outside front door of cottage. Great wet room and toilet. Shower chair and hand rails provided. Easy to find. Very good instructions supplied. Extremely good."
cosawes barton truro,positive,"There is adequate parking to the front of the property with a compacted stone/gravel drive way which is suitable for a wheelchair to move across. There is ample space for turning / reversing a large vehicle i.e. Volkswagen Caravels. The main bathroom has a wet room / shower which was used by the wheelchair user with a Leckey bath / shower trolley. There are no hand rails in the main bathroom / wet room.  We used a MO lift portable hoist when transferring from wheelchair to shower trolley, this was undertaken in the adjoining double bedroom and then moving the trolley with wheelchair user the short distance along the corridor into the wet room."
cosmeston lakes country park penarth,positive,The car park is tarmac with limited disabled parking spaces. On a busy day such as the bank holiday we visited the disabled spaces were full but was plenty of paces on the tarmac  the overflow car park is a feild
cosmo world buffet restaurant aberdeen,negative,There wasn't any place for disable parking but it's near a bus station
cosmo world buffet restaurant aberdeen,positive,The restaurant is part of the Union Square shopping centre so we parked at the shopping centers car park.
costa coffee ayr,positive,"There is plenty of disabled parking as this costa Is part of a big industrial estate  The accessibile toilet are at the back of the store. The space in  the toilet itself is quite small, however there are plenty of handrails and plenty of space to manoeuvre into the toilet from the corridor."
costa coffee bristol,negative,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately away near Waitrose on Link Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
costa coffee bristol,positive,Costa Coffee Shop has a disabled access toilet with grab rails etc
costa coffee cleethorpes,negative,"Difficult to get parked down St. Peter's Avenue where Costa Coffee is.  There is a car park but there is listed blue badge spaces and they're often all taken up so we had to park in a normal bay which made it difficult to get me and my wheelchair in and out of the car. Free car parking here for blue badge holders. There is parallel parking spaces sometimes, but again difficult to find a space here and not suitable if you have a wheelchair in the boot. There are side streets to park in, some with double yellow lines which you can park on with a blue badge, but again just generally parking is a bit of a nightmare hence why I've scored very low. I've found the parking wardens helpful."
costa coffee cleethorpes,positive,Accessible emergency red cord. Plenty of room to manoeuvre around and room to fit my carer in. Plenty of grab rails Clean and tidy. Keypad to get into the toilet which I couldn't use due to difficulty with my hands - it would be better for there to be a radar key on the accessible loo.
costa coffee coatbridge,negative,There is a large  car  park as part of the retail park there are Blue badge space next to this venue however these do fill up quickly. The nearest bus stops are located out side the retail park on the South Circular Road. The toilets are located to the back of the Costa Coffee and access is via two doors and a turn to the left.  There are two toilets these are for both male and female and one of the toilets is accessible. Very happy to note that the Red Cord was down all the way to the floor.
costa coffee cromer,positive,There is blue badge holders parking in West Street leading down to Church Street where Costa Coffee is. There is also disabled parking directly opposite outside Boots.  Other places are in Bond Street by the Post office or in Tucker Street behind the  Church. The main car park  in Meadow Road also has some spaces and a disabled toilet in the Tourist Information Centre.  I have not visited this yet but there is a Changing Place space in Louden Road.  The toilet has a large wall mirror hooks at high and low level for bags and coats. There is a drop down hand rail to the left of the toilet and a fixed one to the right. It also has two upright  rails either side of the basin.  A red pull cord is also provided.
costa coffee derby,negative,There is a disabled toilet located in the cafe which is combined with baby changing facilities. Toilet transfer was to the left but there were two bins in the way. There were grab rails around toilet and sink. Hand dryer was lowered and there was a lowered coat hook. I did manage to do full 360 in my chair. Wouldn't be space for 2 people.  The nearest changing places toilet is in Intu Derby. 
costa coffee derby,positive,There are two reasonably sized accessible bays outside. You can also use the drive through. The dropped kerb & pavement was very smooth.   The Park & Ride bus stops near by. 
costa coffee drive thru edinburgh,positive,"Right next to a tram stop and a train station; buses (2 and 36) stop there; and there's a massive car park. Knocked a star off because the car park was flooded due to heavy rain and the Costa is a drive thru with a store to sit-in too, so the shop is actually in the middle of the car park with few safe paths to actually get there. There are disabled parking bays just next to the store, however, if you're coming by public transport it's difficult to get there I reckon."
costa coffee dundee,positive,"Costa Coffee does not have a car park but, there is on street parking and a couple of council car parks that allow free parking for customers with a disabled blue badge.  There are buses that go all over the Dundee and Angus and a train station beside the main street but, I’m not sure how often the train stops in Broughty Ferry. I arrived in Dundee via the train, and the Costa Coffee in Tesco is only a couple of minutes away from the station. They do have parking available, like most supermarkets, but I didn't look out for accessible bays. The toilets had everything I need, so can't complain. I would struggle to give it a 5 star though as it isn't a changing places loo.  It is a very big car park at this Costa Coffee on the Kingsway because it is located within a retail park. There are plenty of accessible parking beside the pathways of the retail, with parent and child parking also available. Lots of standard parking spaces are also available however, it would be difficult to cross over due to no pathways being near these spaces. Beside the accessible parking spaces there aren’t always a dipped kerb, so you might need to drive on the road to get to one.  You can get a bus from the city centre to the Kingsway retail park and there is plenty of room to be dropped off by taxi. I’m not 100% sure about the public transport though because I always drive my car here. To get to the accessible toilet you need to go past all the tables, which as I’ve said it may be a little difficult to get to in a wheelchair if all the tables are busy. The accessible toilet is spacious at Costa Coffee and I imagine there would be plenty of space for a wheelchair user and someone to assist them. I would say the only thing is that the toilet is nearer the left-hand side of the toilet and there isn’t enough room between the wall and the toilet for someone to transfer at that side, therefore you are only able to transfer at the right-hand side.   In this toilet they had a sign beside the red cord to tell customers to be careful when pulling it because staff will enter immediately. I’ve never seen this for a red cord before, but I think its really good make sure customers don’t pull it if they don’t know what it’s for. Although the writing is a bit small for customers to read.  There is no Changing Places toilet near this Costa Coffee."
costa coffee edinburgh,negative,Non that we could find we just drove around until someone moved. Not good very narrow passage way and if you have a chair you have no room to turn other than backing into the kitchen door which people come and go with hot food and drink above your head. As before when baby chairs are stacked up against the opposite wall nothing can turn to get into the toilet.  The cord in the toilet was tied up which makes it very hard to pull it as even I could not untangle it. Very hard to use as it’s a cluttered hallway and dangerous. On the street very few spaces you just have to park where a blue badge allows traffic wardens move you on even on yellow lines which is allowed so not great. Very tight no way a scooter could get in the door opens onto the staff washing up area so a very busy small hall to get through. The sink was not working as we found out. The dryer was not working but paper towels were provided.
costa coffee edinburgh,positive,"Nearby on street parking plus plenty of buses . Spacious, doubles as baby change, red cord properly deployed. Spacious and clean. Red cord was tied up and so knotted to the grip bar I couldn't untie it without risking setting off the alarm! Excellent loo. Just a bit tight to get into the corridor to get there. Patking only you find a spot in the road and you park with your blue badge. There is some on street parking available but not a great deal. No dedicated spaces that we could find. It is well served by buses though - there are several that go up Lothian road. Toilets were good and large. Door opens out the way which is good.  It says on the door you need to ask Staff at the till for a key but thankfully this wasn't the case when we visited. Hopefully it's always open.   You might need to ask people to move a bit to get to the toilet though. Parking was available in Blue Badge spaces not far from the entrance and there's a bus stop, albeit up a ramp, outside the north entrance. The accessible toilet was next to the main toilets toward the rear of the shop. There was a clear pathway to the accessible loo with no need to do any acrobatics to get around people or tables. The loo had a sliding style door, was spacious enough, had grab rails, an alarm, and was spotlessly clean. Okay parked without any bother Right at door of shopping centre  Good size toilet access could be better but right across from Costa in shopping centire is an excellent rader key toilet good size good access very pleased. There are many bus stops nearby on Princes Street as well street parking within the central reservation along George Street.  The accessible loo is behind the main cafe serving area. It is clean and spacious with baby changing facilities there as well. The day I visited the loo was out of order but the staff were kind enough to let me in anyway.  Decent size, clean, well equipped. Red cord properly deployed. There are 2 disabled parking bays about 150m away outside New Look. There are others elsewhere in the retail park and the pavement is level around most of it.  The now 38 and 42 buses also stop at the Sainsburys although that's 5 mins walk away. Large, clean and with high contrast grab rails. We were impressed! Spacious enough. Red cord was tied up when visited."
costa coffee falkirk,positive,"There are parking spaces directly outside, and also behind the shop in the Central Retail park. There are also bus stops on the street in front, and just across the road is Falkirk Grahamston train station. There is ramped access from the train station and the main street down to the coffee shop. No bother at all."
costa coffee glasgow,positive,It's Sauchiehall Street so you can't expect to park at the door.  Usual on street parking with disabled bays on Cambridge St. Sauchiehall Street is pedestrianised .. All the right features and the cord was ok. Again limited by including baby change. Nappy and sanitary bins in side transfer space. 
costa coffee ilkeston,positive,There are two pay and display car parks to the town centre. Albion centre car park is closest with free parking for badge holders in designated bays. I find these bays are often full. The second car park (Pimlico Street) is usually emptier but further to walk.   If you need to access mobility equipment shopmobility is located  close to Erewash Museum and there is a car park for members. It is only open Thursday and Saturday (9am to 2:30pm). There is a form to complete to become a member.  Bus stops are either up or down a hill. 
costa coffee inverness,negative,"The loo is accessed via a fire door which presented the same challenges as the entrance/exit doors. There was no assistance button at this door. This could be potentially dangerous if there was an emergency especially if you were in the toilet side of the door.  There was lots of room in the corridor leading to the toilet and the toilet itself was clean, spacious and well laid out with grab rails and a red cord but the sliding door could present similar problems to the entrance/exit/fire doors."
costa coffee inverness,positive,"There are disabled spaces right at the door and throughout the retail park. I've never had any problems getting parked in a disabled space but not always in front of the venue. It depends how busy it is within the retail park. There is a frequent bus service to the retail park from Inverness and the east coast (such as Culloden, Nairn etc.). The cafe is about a four or five minute walk from the bus stop. The coffee shop itself hasn't got a toilet but there is one outside the coffee shop."
costa coffee kirkcaldy,negative,"The toilet itself is good - large and clean. The difficulties were getting past the high chairs and banners etc that were in the corridor to get to the toilet. There's also a lock on the door, which makes it very difficult for anyone with impaired dexterity in their hands to get out of the bathroom (theres a lever on it to get out as well as in). I think you're quite likely to need a bit of help if you're a wheelchair user - which was ok for us, but not ideal for a lot of people."
costa coffee kirkcaldy,positive,"Multi story car parks adjacent to the High Stree, blue badge parking on the High St until 12 noon and all day Tuesday. Shopmobility in Mercator Centre.  The cord was tied up and a bin in the transfer space but Vicki, one of the baristas took my feedback on board and immediately rectified the cord. Revisited two weeks later and cord was fixed. If toilet is locked ask staff to open for you. "
costa coffee largs,positive,"We arrived by train. Costa Coffee is about 10 minutes walk away. The pavements don't all have dropped kerbs, your best option is to cross the road when you leave the train station and then cross back over when you are at the Costa. There is a bus stop nearby for those travelling by bus. It is right next to the Largs Ferry Terminal so very handy for anyone arriving on the ferry or could be used as a rest stop before a journey on the ferry. The nearest car park is Seafront Carpark which is a short distance away. This could be accessed by the promenade, which is a nice seafront walkway which is flat and wide. As I mentioned there is a code to get in the accessible toilet. The toilet itself is quite a good size although there was a bin in the transfer area when we visited."
costa coffee lichfield,negative,I saw or saw signs to an accessible toilet but didn’t use it. We know that there was no hoist. Cramped with items not very clean and not always working
costa coffee loanhead,negative,The toilet is through two doors and impossible for me to get into and out of without help.
costa coffee loanhead,positive,Plenty of parking and buses
costa coffee london,negative,"Parking would be difficult nearby. Lots of buses (if you'd like to brave them). We arrived on foot. There is an ""accessible"" toilet, which has been essentially well-designed. But then the staff have undermined the good design by (i) blocking the transfer area by putting a large rubbish bin in it (ii) tying up the red emergency cord in a complex difficult-to-undo knot on one of the grabrails. This is very thoughtless, silly and dangerous. The red emergency cord must hang freely all the way down to the floor, so that it can be reached by anyone who has fallen over, for example during the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back. We came on foot so not sure. I think there might be parking in the Tesco next door."
costa coffee london,positive,"Good sized loo This branch of Costa is yards from London Bridge Station, which *theoretically* has step-free access to both Northern Line and Jubilee Line. In practice one or both of the lifts required to get to these tube lines are out of order or undergoing 'scheduled maintenance' of some sort. Several buses pass through the area, and it's possible to get assistance for National Rail and local suburban trains at London Bridge mainline station. This is a very large accessible toilet with all of these standards grab rails."
costa coffee newcastle upon tyne,positive,"As the venue is inside the Intu Eldon Square shopping centre - parking and transport are great.  There are two large Bus Stations (Haymarket and Eldon Square) with regular accessible bus links around the North East. Both stations have accessible routes to the venue.  Smaller more local bus stops for local bus services are also nearby and are again accessible and near easy access points to the shopping centre. Parking is available throughout the City Centre with disabled bays being prominently displayed. The closest parking would be in Eldon Gardens which has 15+ Disabled Parking Bays and is also home to ShopMobility. The Accessible Toilet is unfortunately not a Changing Places toilet or a Radar key. It is usually well kept, clean, bright, a red cord is available and goes to the floor, and there are a lot of grab rails for support and stability. As seen in the photo the toilet handle is not a paddle handle and may cause issues for some people. There is space for a manual chair - but powerchairs may struggle to move around especially with a carer present."
costa coffee oakham,negative,There are 4 parking spaces outside Costa but you can't always guarantee there'll be any free and it means going on the road to get onto the pavement. There is a public car park 3 mins away and is free for badge holders.
costa coffee oldham,positive,"there was plenty of space to manoeuvre grab rails, it was clean and tidy very accomadating."
costa coffee perth,negative,There is an accessible toilet but it is the only toilet so is used by all
costa coffee perth,positive,"On street parking.  No parking for the venue itself.  Close to bus stops. On pedestrian area. Disabled parking available in large carpark outside venue plus blue badge spaces.  Close to town centre and local bus routes, not far from train station. There is an accessible toilet but I didn't use it. So yeah they do have an Accessible toilet but it's a tight squeeze between tables/chairs to get to it. But once you're there it's all good. It doesn't require a radar key. It's relatively spacious (I can spin round in it without bashing things so it's pretty big when I'm absolutely useless at turning in my chair). Has rails and emergency cord. Space for another person I'd say. It was clean and. Tidy when I was in. The door did feel a bit heavier than most doors so it did take a good yank to open to get in. We walked but there is on street parking right outside the venue and car parking available withing 200 metres at the nearby multi storey private car park.  The cafe is located on the High Street on the Pedestrianised area with access to the zone for blue badge holders before 11am and after 4pm. For use by all customers. "
costa coffee poole,positive,"Dolphin Shopping Centre has excellent parking including Shopmobility. Excellent,  clean toilets."
costa coffee saint andrews,positive,Disabled toilet easy to navigate too through wide corridor.
costa coffee saint catherines walk,positive,Adequate local disabled parking. Costs £1.70 for 2 hours and £4 for 4 hours. So quite costly. It is on the same level as Costa though. Would be better if children did not use the disabled toilets as I had to wait both times I used the toilet due to others using it.
costa coffee saltcoats,positive,there  are Parking spaces available within the town itself. You need to park and then walk to Costa Coffee.
costa coffee scarborough,negative,shop is in the middle of a pedestrian precinct but local parking is often difficult
costa coffee scarborough,positive,"the toilets are excellent, built from scratch as a wheelchair toilet when the shop was made into a coffee shop, so wide door, lovely wide room and good sturdy handles"
costa coffee st andrews,negative,We parked on the street where madras college is no real bother at all Emergency cord tied up out of the way Not good  Disabled one out of order other one had a I’ll fittin seat and bags and rubbish on a taped skirting board
costa coffee stirling,positive,"Bus, train and car park all close by.  Red cord to the floor. All hand rails. "
costa coffee york,negative,"Costa is located at the centre of York where all parking is restricted, even disabled parking. There are no parking facilities owned by Costa however disabled parking card holders are able to park behind costa where sign posts allow."
costa coffee york,positive,"Spacious, hand rails fitted and alarm cord reachable."
costa martianez puerto de la cruz,positive,"Costa Martianez is directly on sea front. The area immediately surrounding it is padestrianised and level and there are a handful of hotels and restaurants opposite it. When I visited I got a taxi to McDonald's and it was a level, couple of minutes walk from there. The toilets and changing room area are located on the inland side and are accessible by ramp or stairs. The accessible toilet was a little tricky to find as it wasn't signposted, but it is next to a restauarant (which I think was called Los Alisios, but I've taken a photo of the entrance). The accessible toilet is spacious and clean with grab rails on both sides of the toilet.  I didnt go swimming when I was there so I'm unable to comment about the changing rooms."
costco edinburgh warehouse loanhead,negative,"One of the main reasons that I went into Costco was to go to the loo, but as I didn’t get passed the door I can’t comment on this "
costco edinburgh warehouse loanhead,positive,Very good parking area. The spaces are very large so easy to open the door wide. 
cosy club leeds,positive,Toilet was spacious with handbars in the correct place with good spacing 
cote brasserie cardiff,negative,No dedicated parking but Blue badge parking available in multi-storeys and on-street nearby.
cote brasserie cardiff,positive,Good sized accessible toilet Good sized accessible toilet.
cote brasserie chelmsford,negative,In the centre of town with a car park 5 minutes away. The car park has 4 disabled spaces and allows free parking for 3 hours if you have a blue badge Disabled loo on ground floor. Access to the loo on occasions is difficult because of high chairs being left in the way. Staff always apologetic and move them ou5 the way.
cote brasserie edinburgh,positive,Dissabled toilet is accessed via a lift to the basement  Big accessible loo which is now on the ground floor.
cote brasserie exeter,negative,Parked in CAthedral car park disabled spaces are on 3rd floor Accessible buses run through city centre only 20 yards from restaurant All easy to get about 
cote brasserie london,negative,"The nearest tube station is Sloane Square, which is not step-free, but does have escalators from the westbound (but NOT the eastbound) platform to street level, so if you can get out of your wheelchair and take it up an escalator, this station may be an option. Loads of buses go along the King's Road. I wouldn't attempt to park nearby. There is an accessible toilet available, it belongs to the adjoining hotel.   To reach it you must pass through many heavy doors, accompanied by a member of restaurant staff, who must bring a key to operate the lift, because the accessible toilet is in the grotty basement, where customers are not normally allowed to go. A few more twists and turns round some shabby and unattractive basement corridors, and you reach the toilet, which has not been laid out correctly.   The red cord is MUCH too short - anyone who fell over in the precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back would not be able to summon assistance - this could be really dangerous in the case of serious injury.   There is no lowerable horizontal bar on the open side of the toilet and there is a bin in the wheelchair transfer area.  See my photos below.  Altogether this is a very poor excuse for an ""accessible"" toilet. Several bus routes will drop you off in Shaftesbury Avenue or Oxford Street, there are no step-free stations nearby. Beware of missing kerb-drops at the junction of Old Compton St and Wardour St, this astonishing omission by Westminster Council makes great difficulties for wheelchair users. The accessible toilet is essentially OK but has a few issues: (1) the coat hook by the toilet door- see above (2) the red emergency cord had been tied up so that it stopped well over a metre above the floor, it should reach all the way to the floor so that it can be pulled if someone falls over and needs help  (3) the toilet room is so small that it's impossible to turn your wheelchair, there's hardly room to wash a hamster. Several bus routes will drop you off practically outside the restaurant. Highbury and Islington Overground station is nearby, and step-free, but Highbury and Islington tube station is *not* step-free. There is no other step-free station nearby. The nearest step-free tube station is King's Cross, which is well over a mile away. The accessible toilet is well-de Not far from London Bridge where I arrived on the Jubilee Line."
cote brasserie london,positive,You can use public transport and there is off street parking for blue badge holders nearby.
cote brasserie salisbury,positive,"We parked in a multi-storey city-centre car park in the Old George Mall.  It had disabled spaces accessed from the shopmobility office at the entrance which issues a day pass.  Disabled parking is all on ground floor and separated from the main car parking, making it a bit safer disembark etc.  The restaurant itself is located in a pedestrianised area so you can't park there, but it's not far from the car park and there are other car parks too. This is the only down side to this restaurant; there is a disabled toilet but it is on the higher level so staff need to take a ramp out for access to it but as already mentioned, staff were only too willing to help in any way they could."
cotswold farm park kineton,positive,There are disabled spaces at the top of the car park very near the entrance. Our big vehicle and tail lift were fine. It is though although firm a bit muddy/gravelly (like you may expect from a farm I guess)
cotswold outdoor london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby. Several bus routes will drop you off in the Strand, which is just a block away."
cotswold outdoor london,positive,Green Park Station is fully step-free and is only a few minutes walk/roll away. Many bus routes will drop you off very near the shop.
cotswold wildlife park and gardens burford,positive,"Plently of disable parking spaces close to the entrance and all the attractions  Great toilets not only disabled toilets but a changing place with hoist and changing table You pay in the car on the way in and then lots of disabled wide bays right by entrance. They have wheelchairs available and I think power ones (check!) but I believe you need to reserve in advance. Plenty of tarmac disabled parking Plenty of accessible loos around the park, had enough space to take a mobility scooter in and turn to get out"
cottage in the dales leyburn,positive,"You can park right by the front door for loading and unloading and then park up a few metres away. All within a private gated courtyard. We travelled by car. Good height and although grab rails in place you can have more if you need them. Loads of room to manoeuvre. Plenty of space for a Carer to assist.Although I didn’t need it the shower chair could also be used as a commode. There is a drop of space in front of the cottage and a parking place in front. Hand rail which goes back next to the toilet and portable suction extra hand rails can be provided. There is a large easy opening  gate across opening to courtyard of the hosts cottage  and the two rental cottages, this had been opened before we arrived. The courtyard is flat and there is an area right next to The Dairy for putting car for easy access and unloading luggage.  A parking space is a few yards away. We didn’t use any other transportation besides our car.  Very large, luxurious bathroom with toilet included. Grab rails both sides of toilet, with one lifting up when required. High toilet. There is plenty of room for a cater to assist. Other aids are made available if required. Absolutely spotless. On site parking next to the property on a flat even surface . No problems with toilet .  Designated parking, yards from door. Car essential This Cottage is not easily accessible by public transport as it is situated within the Dales National Park, but driving there by car is no problem. Parking is on the level adjacent to the Cottage. The loo in he cottage is fully accessible with plenty of turning space for wheelchair and low level wash basins etc."
coughton court alcester,negative,"There is an accessible loo outside. Its clean, relatively spacious and has grab bars and an alarm.  The drawback is that when you enter the loo the first room is for baby changing and breastfeeding mums and they can lock the door so in that instance you would not be able to access the disabled loo at all ."
coul house hotel contin,positive,"Beautiful spacious toilet with many grab handles and the first disabled toilet I have encountered that did not have a foot operated pedal bin. We were able to park right outside the door to the restaurant part of the building. The car park was of a good size. On the flat, plenty of manoeuvring room. Lovely toiletries!"
coulee verte rene dumont paris,positive,"The Place de la Bastille is well served by buses, which are wheelchair accessible. The eastern end of the trail is close to the stop called Montempoivre on tram line 3a, which starts at Porte de Vincennes. Paris trams are fully wheelchair accessible. The Metro, with the exception of Line 14 v is not. We encountered one accessible toilet. It was spacious and well-equipped with grab rails and accessible wash basin. There was room for side transfer, but the toilet had no alarm system. "
counter vauxhall bar brasserie london,positive,"Right outside Vauxhall train station, underground and bus station. Decent accessible toilet."
county hall london,positive,"County Hall is on London's Southbank next to the London Eye. The entrance of Witness for the Prosecution is located on Belvedere Road. The nearest tube or train station is Waterloo. Waterloo tube has some step free access but it depends which line and entrance you use. The Jubilee Line at Waterloo via Waterloo Hall entrance is step free with lift access between street and platform. And the Bakerloo Line via York Road entrance also. For all  other options please check with TFL (Transport for London) website.  Westminster tube station is also close by and has step free access on Circle and District Lines. Both Westminster and Waterloo Bridges are wheelchair accessible, as are the Golden Jubilee Bridges, connecting the South Bank with Victoria Embankment on the north side. There are a few buses routes that stop a couple of minutes walk from County Hall. There is a disabled accessible toilet with grab rails located within the main toilets. It is clean and very spacious. The doors to the toilets and the individual toilet cubicle are standard, manual doors.  There is some on street parking nearby, good bus links and two accessible tube stations Plenty of large accessible toilets."
court hotel city center utrecht utrecht,negative,"No parking nearby.  No public parking in the old town at all, and I doubt there are many (if any) buses.  Everyone uses bicycles The toilet in the bathroom has one shaky grab rail, but it was not possible for me to get in/out of the bathroom without assistance - no space to manoeuvre , and steep narrow ramps to get to the bathroom  public toilet in  the basement accessed by lift.  Plenty of space, grab rails etc."
courtside cottage falkland,positive,"Parking is right next the to accommodation entrance with ample space either side of the car and a gentle ramp up to the garden and front door thru a gated entrance. Therr were grab rails and low level units, mirrors, hooks etc in the spacious wet room, making it fully accessible for all users. The heated flooring ensured the room was kept at a pleasant temperature. Disabled parking was next to the cottage The planning of the accessible bathroom was very good with plenty of grab rails, and a shower seat. The room was large enough to negotiate in a wheelchair. It was well equiped and even had a bidet."
cove harbour cockburnspath,positive,Good car park and bus service.
cowells garden centre woolsington,positive,A few disabled bays close to the door.
cowley manor cheltenham,positive,"A lovely scenic drive took us through the estate to the manor, and a fair sized car park. Only two bays for disabled, but all spots are close enough to the house anyway"
coylumbridge hotel aviemore,negative,big enough but access within ladies toilets no soap to wash hands no paper towels either during covid times.
coyote ugly saloon liverpool,negative,"Liverpool Central Station 5 mins walk away, Taxis/Buses 2-3 mins away Not the biggest and dated however it was clean and tidy. Access is via a key from the bar and the staff assisted with the double doors leading to the toilet.  "
crabshakk glasgow,negative,Almost impossible to navigate from Restaurant to disabled toilet
crabshakk glasgow,positive,Street parking outside restuarant
craft burger cromer cromer,positive,"Parking is always difficult to find in Cromer, but there are a few disabled spaces near the church which we use regularly. The large car park near the centre always has spaces as well. Very spacious, well laid out and accessible. Good grab rails in all the right places."
crafty scholar lancaster,negative,I went in my own transport with Disabled parking up the street but quite a small space so usually taken.
cragside rothbury,positive,"Car is best, not sure about public transport, I think you would struggle There are Blue Badge spaces at the top of the formal garden plus at the visitor centre. Can't comment on public transport though shouldn't think this is on a main bus route being some way out of Rothbury. Located in the visitor centre complex - it was well equipped and clean. Though a bit snug, there was enough room to manoeuvre a wheelchair with a few turns. No radar key needed."
craigatin house and courtyard pitlochry,positive,Wet room was en suite with the usual grab bars
craigellachie national nature reserve aviemore,negative,The start of our woodland adventures was by the Youth Hostel in Aviemore. A pretty handy spot as it’s still in the village and not far from the railway station. Visitors to the Reserve are allowed to park in the Youth Hostel’s car park and the trail into the Reserve started from here. A typical woodland path with compacted surface but challenged by the odd tree root and drainage channel.
craigielaw golf club longniddry,positive,"We drove to Craigielaw Golf Club. There is no designated disabled parking but the carpark is large and there is space for parking just outside the entrance. We had no problem parking. There is a disabled toilet which is spacious but has no emergency red cord.  See photo  Venue not accessible by public transport. No blue badge spaces but can park beside front door. Clean, plenty of room, but not enough to turn the wheelchair round. "
craigies farm deli and cafe south queensferry,negative,You would need to arrive here by road as this venue is a bit remote.  However there is a nice big car park immediately outside the farm. A bit 'rustic' but perfectly serviceable.
craigies farm deli and cafe south queensferry,positive,"There are 4 disabled bays within 20 metres of the entrance with plenty parking beyond. One accessible toilet with grab rails. Space for carer. Disabled spaces are right outside the door into the cafe & deli & the car park is tarmac. Accessed through a swing door from the deli, there's plenty of space in the toilet with plenty of room for a carer. There are grab rails & it's well set up."
craigleith retail park to davidsons mains railway line pathway edinburgh,positive,"Shopper's Parking at Craigleith Retail Park. Can't comment on the parking in Davidson's Mains. Craigleith Retail Park is served by Lothian Bus 38 from the Royal Infirmary via the south side and Balgreen (not at weekends, when you need to alight at the Holiday Inn - see below) . Lothian Buses 41, 42 & 43 connect the city centre with Queensferry Road - get off at the Holiday Inn and you'll be close to the start of the walk, which is just down South Groathill Avenue. From Davidson's Mains Lothian Buses 41 & 42 go back to the city centre. There are good accessible toilets in some of the shops at Craigleith Retail Park. Can't comment on Davidson's Mains."
craigmillar castle edinburgh,negative,"One disabled parking space, against the wall of the visitor centre - no hatched space to the right, so a mobility impaired driver would have to reverse into the space to be able to get out with ease."
craigmillar castle edinburgh,positive,"Good space, a heavy wheel chair might get stuck in the grass on approach to the toilets. At the visitor centre we received the 4 digit code for the toilets on our receipt. The toilets where clean and the disabled toilet was a good size and not cluttered."
craigmillar castle park edinburgh,negative,"The park is a bit of a hidden gem. We accessed the park via the entrance behind Bridgend Farmhouse. There is no parking in the immediate area but the 24, 33, 38 and 49 buses all stop nearby and it is half a mile from Cameron Toll Shopping Centre where you can park for free. Alternatively, you could access the park from Craigmillar. There are also a few parking spaces at Craigmillar Castle but this would mean navigating a fairly steep path."
craigmillar library edinburgh,negative,"Spacious accessible loo with grab rails and good fittings. Let down by the positioning the door lock too high for many wheelchair users. The rotary nature of the door lock mechanism is exceedingly difficult to turn. We were dropped off so didn't have to park, the car park does not have a lot of spaces. It is on a public transport route."
craigmillar library edinburgh,positive,Close to the bus stop with regular buses into Edinburgh city centre. There looked to be a couple of parking spaces nearby but we didn't have a car with us so didn't take too much notice. The toilet was clean with hand rails and plenty of room to move around. It would benefit from a changing places toilet.
craigtoun country park st andrews,positive,"Realistically , you will need a car to get there although there is an infrequent bus service, but there are an adequate number of disabled bays right at the entrance.  Located beside the café and picnic area but there are also loos in a block in the middle of the park."
crail community hall crail,positive,"There is parking at the back of the venue on the right hand side. To get there take the lane just before the Hall.   Public transport is pretty tricky, I think there are low level buses that travel through Crail  but I'm not sure how frequent they are. Pretty great once we'd moved the bin to the other side of the loo.  Ever so slightly tight for Euan's chair but its pretty long relative to other powerchairs (its c180cm)."
cramond kirk hall edinburgh,positive,The nearest bus stop is about a ten minute walk away. It is down a slightly narrow pavement and the acces to the centre involves walking for a short way along the access road which is very smooth The accessible loo is well equipped and is pretty good. It is large enough to manoeuvre and has grab rails. It is just of the main foyer area right next the the ladies loos and is easy to locate. There is enough room for a carer.
crathes castle banchory,positive,Crathes is on the main Royal Deeside road from Aberdeen. We arrived by car and after approaching along the tree lined drive we swept in to a large car park. Looking for accessible parking bays for our WAV (wheelchair accessible vehicle) we spotted the sign for disabled parking. We drove past the Castle and on around to the dedicated parking at the back of the gift shop.  A spacious accessible toilet was located in the cafe building.
crathie opportunity holidays ballater,positive,"Plenty of parking and you can take your car to the door to load and unload. Brilliant. Closemat toilet and rise 'n fall wash basin. We were able to disembark in front of the cottage, unload and move the car to the carpark on-sight. Easy access to the cottage- all on the flat. As we use a stand aid it was a bit tight for space, but we managed OK. There is an overhead rail available for hoisting. Parking is in a small car park part of the complex. You can drive up to your cottage to unload but must return car to the car park The bathroom had anti slip flooring. Shower had grab rails and a pull down seat. The toilet had grab rails. The wash basin was adjustable using an electric hand control."
crathie opportunity holidays crathie,positive,"Parking is at the front of the cottages which also have security gates. We have stayed at Clunie and Girnock cottages there are 2 toilets with a fully functional disabled access toilet with Cols o Mat and wheelchair access showers. Parked right next to cottages and 100 yard from cottage we stayed in. All flat and transfer easy in and out of car There was loads of room for manoeuvre in the toilet/showeroom. The fact that there was a wash hand basin which came down with the press of a button for my dad to b able to shave himself and see in the mirror independently was great. Private, secure car park, with plenty of rooms for cars.. Toilets, are wet rooms, with closomat toilets, and adjustable sinks, very spacious and shower chairs available on request. Disabled parking within a few metres of the cottages but you can take the car up to the cottage to load and unload Lots of space, grab rails at the toilet and the shower, a clos-o-mat toilet and a height adjustable sink Very easy, just of the main Aberdeen - Braemar road, with its own secure car park, with plenty of space, with the ability to take you car right to the door of your cottage, for easy unloading. Wet room, with Closetmatic toilet, height adjustable sink, ceiling track rail and enough room to use stand aids and shower chairs. You can drive up to your cottage to load/unload then your car stays in the carpark a very short distance just round the corner. This keeps the courtyard area that the cottages open on to safer and quieter. Closomat toilet with tracking hoist if required. We drove. I could park the car a few yards from the cottage and get close up to unload. The roadway and paved areas were in very good condition so no bumps to avoid.  Grab rails provided but was a little high, possibly as a result of being Closomat variety. Not impossible to cope with but I'd advise checking out the access statement to check height."
creake abbey cafe and food hall north creake,negative,"Level parking  for two.  Transport unknown. Signage, with baby change."
creams cafe windsor,negative,"Unfortunately the venue is in a traffic free area  with no adjacent car parking, however there are car parks a short distance away.  Not too far from both bus routes & stations."
creams cafe windsor,positive,The disabled loo is accessed directly from the cafe - unfortunately it was out of order on my visit.
creative exchange edinburgh,negative,"In the garage, the lighting isn't very good and so it is quite hard to see where you are going in the garage.  In addition, the side door isn't very accesible as it is very hard to open."
creative exchange edinburgh,positive,"On street parking is available a short distance from the main door. There is also a car park in the building which can be used by arrangement. The accessible loo was a surprise as it was quite spacious and had a good wide door for access. There are grab rails and it was spotlessly clean and tidy. Didn't see any emergency alarm cord. In the desabled loo it is very well lit.  However, the cord keeps getting wrapped around things and so this could be a problem to someone. There is a private car park for use and on street parking. There are good bus links to the city centre close by. On street parking. Parking may be available by arrangement in the garage if you have access requirements. Buses pass along nearby Bernard Street and along the Shore. An accessible toilet is provided on ground floor level. It has a wide opening door, plenty of room for me as a powerchair user, grab rails and space for a left hand transfer. It has an alarm cord."
creta maris beach resort iraklio,positive,"We used transport arranged by our disabled travel company so it was hassle free, it was a van with a tail lift ( we are a family of 5) . I’ve only given it 4 because I know it was expensive because we rebooked it to go into town and it was almost double as much as a regular taxi... now it did take 6 instead of 4 , but still...however, nice to actually have wheelchair transport so perhaps I shouldn’t complain! Disabled toilets everywhere,  mostly a little small for turning  but nice and clean"
crieff hydro crieff,negative,"We got a taxi from Perth train station because of line problems coming to Dunblane. So it's not easy or cheap to get here by public transport. It is uphill from the village so you do need a door-to-door arrangement. We can recommend Crieff Premier Taxis for a confident, safe and friendly service. Only accessed in room, described as above  I didn’t use the loo in the main hotel, my partner looked at it and  said it was ‘OK’."
crieff hydro crieff,positive,"Nice bathroom. No roll in shower.  Disabled parking at front of reception and paved road up to the hut to get kitted out with harnesses. All good really Disabled parking at the front of the hotel and drop off parking too. Push button automatic door to the reception. The staff will come with a trolley and pick up your luggage from your car at the front of the hotel. If you arrive too early for check-in at 2pm and your room is not ready, your luggage will be stored to be delivered to your room later. The public disabled loos are big and have drop down bars in each one. Room for carers and sinks at a good height. One on the ground floor along from reception, one opposite the cinema and Brasserie, a huge one in the Victorian Spa(recently renovated, another down at the Hub cafe, where the children's activity building is and the sports hall. this one has a walk in shower as well. We drove and the accessible parking is just before you approach the main entrance. Great accessible loo that we used near the cafe. (Just untie the red cord please!) lots of spaces good room, smooth paths to hotel entrance based on toilet in room Plenty of parking space at the a.ccessible cottage and a reasonable number of spaces at the main hotel."
cringletie house hotel cringletie,positive,"Designates parking bays near entrance There is an accessible loo on the ground floor. En-suite bathroom was spacious with a roll-in shower, grabrails etc."
crockers folly london,positive,The restaurant is in St John's Wood and located between several tube stations. The nearest tube is St John's Wood which has escalator access between street and platform.  It's then a short bus ride and then a 5 - 10 minute walk. We picked up a taxi from Marylebone Station which took about 5 minutes and cost about £7. Alternatively as the disabled access is better at Paddington Station I would suggest getting  taxi from there but it is a busier station. We got a taxi back to Marylebone when we finished and the restaurant kindly phoned for a taxi for us.  There was a spacious disabled accessible toilet on the ground floor which was clean. There were grab rails and emergency cord. The emergency cord didn't touch the floor and I informed the staff who said they would fix it.
crocodiles of the world carterton,negative,"As far as I could see, there were just 2 blue badge parking spaces.  The rest of the car park was gravelled which could be challenging for a wheelchair/scooter. I don't think there is any public transport.  I saw a sign for accessible loo but didn't use it"
croft bungalow birchover,positive,"Parked our wheelchair Accessible vehicle out side the front door of the bungalow. The loo is fully accessible, lots of space, with grab rails and space for a carer. Very clean and a hoist is available to use for changing. They had a drive and had clear instructions of what is best to do with regards to driving in forward or reversing depending on how you load/unload  Toilet is fine it’s in a wet room so there is space to get a wheelchair in (although we don’t need to use accessible toilet) "
crofton hall coffee shop carlisle,positive,"Very rural location, would need a car to visit, even then quite difficult to find. The main car park is a distance from the coffee shop, but there is a disabled drop of point at the door. Signage to locate coffee shop is poor, and SAT nav takes you further up the road to a farm Lacking signage, but clean , tidy, and plenty of space. Lots of tables and chairs to negotiate to access the main access to toilets"
crollas gelateria edinburgh,negative,There was an accessible toilet but could had more grip bars etc.
crollas italian kitchen musselburgh,negative,"There are lots of parking spaces nearby in the car park off Station Road in Musselburgh, however, I don't believe there are any blue badge holder spaces particularly close to the restaurant. I have always visited at the weekend and as the rest of the surrounding buildings are mainly offices there are always plenty of spaces available. There are some bus stops near the Tesco."
crollas italian kitchen musselburgh,positive,"Car Park 100 yards away was easy to park in. Good size, sliding door very clean"
croma edinburgh,positive,The restaurant is located very close to Lothian Road which is well served by many different buses. There is some street parking nearby and there is a car park on the adjacent Semple Street.  
crombie country park angus,positive,"As you drive through the entrance to Crombie Country Park there are a few car parks at the right-hand side that have plenty of parking spaces, including accessible parking. However, if you are wanting to shorten your walk or aren’t able to carry picnic very far, you are able to park at the accessible parking spaces within the park close behind the information house. There is plenty of signage directing you to this accessible parking but, inorder to get in to the park by car you need to be able to get out of the car open a gate, drive through, get out to close the gate again and then drive up to the parking spaces.  Crombie is located in a rural area of Angus and I’m unsure of what the public transport services would be like for visiting. There are 3 toilet areas in Crombie park, one at the main car park area and two spaced out beside the picnic areas. I don’t know if all of them have a disabled toilet in the huts but, there is one beside the information house. I wouldn’t say it is a very big toilet but, I think there would be enough space for someone in a wheelchair and if they need assistance from someone else. You can find an image of the toilet below.  Full marks for the parking arrangements. Large clear signs directed us to the accessible parking area just beyond the Visitor Information Point in the 'Rangers House' and parking with plenty of space to deploy the vehicle ramp and get out. "
cromer pier cromer,positive,"There are several blue badge spaces on the promenade, and here's a tip on how to find them from my Norfolk-based uncle Les. When you drive into the town, find the Morrison's petrol station. Look across the road from there and you'll see a fish and chip restaurant with a sloping driveway next to it leading down from the town level to the promenade. There are 'access only' signs on this to stop traffic going down - but ignore those, because this access is for you and your blue badge! Drive along the promenade a few metres when you get to the bottom of the slope and you'll see the blue badge car park.  The only drawback is that it gets quite full - we were lucky to take the last available space. Very pleased to find a clean, reasonably spacious accessible loo on Cromer Pier, and someone before me had even put a Euan's Guide card on the emergency cord!"
cromford mills cromford,negative,"Not many parking spaces - however was bank holiday The parking bays are very small and poorly marked, no extra space for wheelchair access, some of the larger cars were well over their allotted spaces."
cromford mills cromford,positive,Changing place at the canal was great.
cromlix hotel kinbuck,positive,"Set in the country so you would need to have your own transport. Separate disabled access but this is all gravel so a bit difficult to push a wheelchair over. Beautiful disabled toilet with plenty of room. There is accessible parking at the near end of the building, as you make your way up the driveway you will see a sign directing you up to the right hand side as the road forks. The surface is small pebble stones, which may be an issue for some, but was fine for us. Although there was no changing places loo, the toilets in the Cromlix were quite spacious and extremely clean. "
croome croome court,positive,All accessible though a bit stoney. There is a wheelchair friendly shuttle between reception and the house. Accessible loo at reception. Not at the house but big enough to manage with help.
cross keys guisborough,negative,Could be marked better and nearer to the Main door
cross keys peebles,negative,There is no parking other than restricted parking on the street. The restriction only allows 45min parking between 8.30am and 6pm. There are no dedicated disabled spaces. There are several car parks nearby but then involve a distance back to the hotel There is on street parking but it may be difficult to get parked as it is close to the town centre.
cross keys peebles,positive,Good size disabled toilet in the restaurant. The only negative point is that there are two doors. The second has a normal lock which may make summoning help difficult Good accessible toilets with plenty of grab rails.
cross roads hotel weedon bec,negative,"Large car park but only two disabled spaces. Although they where the closest ones to the entrance. Proper large accessible toilet, let down by normal domestic size and height pan and loose toilet seat. (reported to staff 13.05.15)."
crossbasket castle glasgow,positive,We drove to the castle. The sign was not all that clear. There was plenty of parking at the castle and we were able to drop me off right outside the main entrance. The ground floor has a wheelchair accessible toilet.
crosshill railway station glasgow,negative,"You are able to park your car on the sidestreets that are near the train station. However, this may involve having to cross a busy road. There are traffic lights but they are located a wee bit down the hill from the entrance to the station. "
crosstown eatery drinkery edinburgh,positive,"Fantastic bus routes nearby as close to Fountain Park, and close to Haymarket train station."
crouch end picturehouse london,negative,Parking in crouch end can be busy but there are bays right outside.
crowhurst park battle,negative,"Parking is right by the lodge, but isn't flat so we kept having to use the flat parking areas to do wheelchair transfers and hoisting. Doesn't leave a lot of space by the car to get onto the ramp Fold up grab rails each side, sturdy seat and lid, but VERY high for me at 5 feet 5 tall"
crowne plaza birmingham city birmingham,negative,N/a
crowne plaza birmingham city birmingham,positive,"Available Just outside the hotel on request , lowered kerbs make things easy"
crowne plaza birmingham nec birmingham,negative,"There were grab rails but that was the only thing that made this a disabled bathroom, as previously described. Toilet was nice and clean. In the foyer there was also a disabled toilet which was suitable. "
crowne plaza glasgow,negative,"I didn't use any of the public toilets in the hotel so I cannot comment on them.  I didn’t see the bathrooms in the new ‘accessible’ rooms in person but, it was included in the video I saw. Like me if you are unable to get into a bath then the bathroom in the new ‘accessible’ room is not accessible for you. Both of the ‘accessible’ rooms that we saw at The Crowne Plaza had baths in them. The rest of the bathroom looks fairly accessible with a grab rail beside the toilet, 2 red cords hanging freely and space under the sink to get underneath. Although I do think it would be quite tight if you had to use a hoist in the bathroom, especially if you had to turn through the doorway from the bedroom area."
crowne plaza glasgow,positive,"Great transport to the town as taxis are easy to get, their is a bus stop about a 5 or 10 mins walk away and the train station is nearby what is manned by Scotrail Nearest train station is Glasgow Central Nearest subway station is Exhibition  Accessible bathroom with roll-in shower and emergency pull cords. Handheld Shower with Hose Built-in Shower Transfer Seats Handrails Roll-in Showers Safety Bar in Shower Bathroom Doors Open Outwards (in Accessible Rooms) Accessible Bathroom Controls There are over 5 disabled parking spaces round the back of the hotel in the hotel car park as well as many more non-disabled spaces in close proximity. You pay £6 for the car park per day of you staying at the hotel. The taxi rank for the hotel is right at the front door with plenty of space to have room to unload luggage.   An 8 minute walk from the hotel is the Exhibition Centre railway station where you can get a train to Glasgow Central Station, or it is a 14 minute drive from the hotel to Glasgow Central Station if you want to get a taxi.  I’m not sure about bus connections to the hotel, I didn’t see any bus stops or bus stations nearby.  I didn’t have a look at the public toilet within the hotel, so I cannot comment on it.   The toilet in the accessible room was quite narrow however, I was very surprised there was a tracking hoist in it. Although you have to dismount the hoist machine from the tracking in the bedroom and connect it to the tracking in the bathroom. The tracking hoist goes right over the toilet and provides easy transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back. There was just enough space for myself and my helper along with my wheelchair but if someone had a bigger wheel I feel they may struggle. Photo below to roughly see the size of the bathroom.  The sink in the bathroom is not height adjustable and too small to reach into however, the main problem is transferring into the shower. If you do not need the use of the hoist to transfer on to the shower chair then there shouldn’t be a problem because there is plenty of space, but the hoist doesn’t reach into the shower to transfer. The tracking hoist goes diagonally across the bathroom which means it is nowhere near the shower as the tracking hoist goes to the left of the bathroom and the shower is at the right. See photo below for a better idea. There are plenty of accessible parking spaces within the car park of The Crowne Plaza at the back entrance however, it is a long walk from the car park to the reception through a corridor. It's £7 each night to park here, don't forget to say to reception when you check in or you could get a parking ticket. I've always parked in the car park but, I would say there is space at the main entrance where you could get dropped off and unload your luggage. This is also where the taxi rank is.  It is an 8 minute walk from the hotel to the Exhibition Centre railway station where you can get a train to Glasgow Central Station, or it is a 14 minute drive from the hotel to Glasgow Central Station if you want to get a taxi.  I’m not sure about bus connections to the hotel, I didn’t see any bus stops or bus stations nearby. There is a large car park at the back but when you arrive and depart you can park at the front doors to make life simpler for access for the guest and unloading all equipment. Conceierge are very good at coming out to help take everything to your room.  The accesible  toilet is near main reception, spacious for wheel chair and carer. Clean and tidy.  Disabled parking is right outside the side door of the hotel in designated slots. Taxis can pull up outside the front door. The metro train from Glasgow Central is a short walk which may be too far for a wheelchair user with luggage. "
crowne plaza hotel marlow marlow,negative,"Public toilets did not have a disabled toilet, but mens and ladies where reasonably big enough to get a wheelchair in with effort, but just ordinary cubicle facilities."
crowne plaza london kings cross london,positive,King Cross Station The loo did not have a rail on both sides.
crowne plaza solihull solihull,negative,"It’s hard work getting from reception and into toilets, there are far to many doors to push your way to get from one door to the next, you will need to take your carer with you to help open these doors, and then it’s only a basic toilet. Disappointing for such a large hotel.  "
crowne plaza solihull solihull,positive,"It’s only a shortish drive through the centre of Solihull, and easy to get to car park area for the hotel."
crowwood house hotel chryston,negative,"The bathroom was very disappointing and clearly a token effort.  I knew before we arrived there was going to be a bath instead of a shower.  Not great but I was only staying 1 night.  The toilet was extremely low (even my dad commented how low it was), thankfully I had asked for the height when booking and brought my own seat riser (they don’t supply such a thing), even with that it was hard work.  The hand rails were badly located, the drop down one even when down was too far back to be of use.  The sink was lower down, but as it was boxed in there was no room for knees underneath.  They had also opted for two taps instead of a mixer one. Such a scolding issue.  Unfortunately they had decided not to put a carpet bar on, so the join between the bathroom tiles and room carpet had a raw edge that I got my foot caught in each time.  The floor files also got very slippy when wet, I couldn’t get off the toilet when we first arrived as my feet kept sliding.   There was no disabled toilet upstairs at the function suite as no access.  However there was one in the foyer of the hotel, but I never used it."
croy railway station croy,positive,There are disabled parking bays adjacent to the booking office and the Glasgow bound platform. There's a bus stop immediately outside the station building with local bus links to Cumbernauld and the surrounding areas. There is an accessible toilet in the booking office area.
cruickshank botanic garden aberdeen,positive,We did see a couple of wheelchair user parking spaces - the vehicle entrance is in St Machar Drive. Bus no. 20 from the city centre  gets you quite close - see review of St Machar's Cathedral for detail.
cruise ships southampton,positive,"Cruise ship parking my be at the dock or valet parking off site. Whatever is on offer if you let the line know you are disabled they will meet you at your car and take luggage from you. We sometimes leave the car with friends and use Transmobility, a specialist company with a fleet of vehicles that can accommodate most chairs, scooters and their travel companions.  There are accessible toilets on all decks of the big ships, they are spacious and have rails. You are always advised to use the loo in your cabin for convenience and hygiene.  Wet rooms in accessible cabins are well appointed with shower seats and rails. Ask for a rubber bath mat for extra security. You can request toilet risers and bath seats in standard cabins.  A friend we cruise with has poor balance and she prefers the standard cabin with less room around the bed and a pod-type shower as she says she does not have so far to fall. "
cruz 101 manchester,negative,"It's possible to park just outside the village, with bays and double yellows available for those with blue badges. There are also black cabs (wheelchair accessible) at one end of the village and halfway down to take you home after!"
cucina alexandria,negative,"There is an accessible toilet and 2 male and 2 female toilets.  On the door from the restaurant to the toilets it only shows a male/female sign, I was a little unsure if the accessible toilet was in the same place, so an additional sign here might be useful.  There is a door from the restaurant to where the toilets are, the corridor here is fairly narrow if in a bigger wheelchair/scooter, but is ok.  The accessible toilet has a sliding door. It is also the baby change area. Toilet is big enough to have a carer with you if required.   Toilet had a lowering support handle to right side (when on toilet) and fixed wall support on left.  Did have an emergency cord, and although going straight down it didn't  reach the floor - so this could also be changed. "
cucina alexandria,positive,"Balloch train station is nearby - a couple minutes walk along the street. This is a small train station and not always staffed - so only basic facilities there.  There are local buses in the area.   La Cucina has its own small car park behind the restaurant (I'm unsure how many disabled parking places as we didn't use it). You can usually also get parked on the street to the side of the restaurant, which is free.   The road immediately outside the restaurant is the main street, so I would avoid parking there if you can. "
cucina minucci at the junction lochwinnoch,negative,Parking can be difficult on the Main Street as it is quite narrow. However it is possible to park at the castle Semple outdoor activity centre and walk to to cafe from there 
cuckoos bakery edinburgh,negative,"I scootered there, but there is a bus stop nearby. Parking is less easy but should be possible, especially with a blue badge. There is only one toilet and it isn't an accessible toilet. It isn't big enough for a wheelchair or scooter and even a walker would be a squeeze.  I parked my scooter outside and managed using the wall for balance, but it isn't any good for anyone who can't stand and take a few steps unaided. "
cullen bay hotel cullen,positive,"We drove and there was plenty of parking space. There were no designated spaces but it was easy to park around the back were the disabled entrance was. Not aware of any public transport. Plenty of space to turn, transfer and faultless once I’d hung a red cord card."
culloden battlefield visitor centre culloden,positive,Parking was quite easy for me as the normal parking space was big enough for our WAV. The modern visitor centre had toilets located adjacent to the cafe area. Passing though the lobby door there were male and female toilets and once inside each had an accessible toilet.  Large spacious and well appointed. Be careful when opening the door to leave as you emerge right alongside the hand driers where people are often standing or queueing. We used car and disabled parking was great. It had accessible toilets but wasn't spotless but extremely busy so keeping on top of it could be difficult. We travelled by car so can't comment on public transport.  20 disabled parking spaces in front of the visitor centre. Free parking for members of National Trust for Scotland  Good disabled toilet beside reception. Only negative is the disabled toilets are inside the ordinary toilets so I found that awkward as my husband usually pushes me to the toilet.
culloden battlefield visitor centre culloden moor,negative,The toilets weren’t perhaps the easiest to find and the signage for the accessible toilets a bit confusing. Only by going in to the main toilets did you work out the accessible loos were actually inside the main loos. Plenty parking spaces and accessible parking very close to museum door. There is no public transport routes nearby as the venue is in the countryside.
culloden battlefield visitor centre culloden moor,positive,"Ample amount of space with everything needed to hand. We parked in a normal parking space, but disabled parking was widely available"
culloden moor inn inverness,negative,"There was a disabled toilet/ baby change which seemed clean and fairly easy to get round in.  It had  grab rails but it was also storing sun umbrellas in the corner next to one of the grab rail, which might have been a problem for some people."
culloden moor inn inverness,positive,It was fairly quiet when we went so parking was easy and on-site.  
culmore country park londonderry,positive,Plenty of space in the car park for any type of vehicle. Lots of room to unload me and my wheelchair. 
culross palace dunfermline,negative,None at the palace but some a few moments away
culross palace dunfermline,positive,Car parks quite a way from the village centre but fine with a mobility scooter. Would not be so good without . Perhaps invest in a golf buggy to transfer disabled customers.
cultivo lounge letchworth garden city,positive,Plenty of parking in town and also a car park  at rear.   5 minute walk from Letchworth station. Has always been clean and very large.  Enough room for wheelchair and a career if needed.
culzean castle and country park maybole,negative,No specialised disabled/blue badge holder parking at swan pond There are toilets at all the main buildings. They are basic but well maintained and clean. There are alarm call cords for emergency use 
culzean castle and country park maybole,positive,We drove but there is a local regular bus service. Also the train runs from Glasgow central to Maybole where you can then get a taxi or bus 
cumbrae ferry terminal cumbrae,positive,Ace - you just stay in the car and don't have to do anything else! There is a bus that goes around Cumbrae which we spotted but we didn't need to use it and don't know whether it's wheelchair accessible.
cunninghame house irvine,negative,There is an accessible loo on every floor and they are immaculate at all times. Sometimes they are open but most of the time you have to get the key from the front reception on the ground floor so it causes a bit of hassle trying to get into.
cunninghame house irvine,positive,"There are a large number of disabled parking spaces located around the front and back of the building, however there are a large number of non-badge holders who park here on a daily basis as they can't find other parking and find this acceptable"
curiouser curiouser edinburgh,negative,The number 8 bus goes down Broughton Street 
curl up dye littlestone,negative,Easy asccess
curl up dye littlestone,positive,"Bus stop just at the door. Parking free in side streets and outside, Blue Badge etc"
currys pc world falkirk,positive,"The large retail capark has many disabled bays and I was able to park directly opposite the shop.  There are numerous accessible parking bays outside of the store, and level smooth paving into the shop. The nearest public transport is around a ten or fifteen minute walk just outside of the central retail park."
currys pc world poole,negative,"Randomly placed near the front of the shop but far enough away from the entrance/exit depending where you do choose to park, to make it sufficiently difficult should you be carrying tech and sticks, or wheeling yourself. Spaces are NOT monitored."
cutlery works sheffield,negative,We used the super tram and walked 10 minutes slow walk from Infirmary Road tram stop.
cutlery works sheffield,positive,David found it very accessible and there was plenty of space and dining area was very spacious.
cutty sark london,negative,"There is very little parking near the venue, any parking that does exist is at the top of the park which is a good distance away. DLR station (Cutty Sark for Maritime Greenwich) isn't far away, if you use the lift come out and turn right, if you use the escalator come out and turn left. The boat service is close by too, now sponsored by Uber but back when I went it was sponsored by MBNA. "
cutty sark london,positive,"The accessible toilets are located under the vessel, there are signs and again the staff were helpful. Not masses of space within the toilet, I think powerchair users might struggle.  There is on street parking in the area for Blue Badge holders. There's also a DLR station that is accessible. Low floor buses also serve the area. There are accessible toilets and I visited the one situated adjacent to the cafe and gallery space under the vessel. It was modern, it even had an automated door, was spotlessly clean and had grab rails and all that you might expect. I travelled to the Cutty Sark by boat and from Greenwich Pier there was a step free route to the ship. The nearest station is Cutty Sark on the Docklands Light Railway 9DLR) which has step free access. There were 2 accessible toilets, one on the top deck and one by the cafe on the ground floor. The toilets were spacious with grab rails and emergency cord."
cwrt bleddyn hotel usk,negative,"2 disabled spaces with concrete ramp leading to cobblestone area and reception. Steps into reception and spa. Loo in room too small to transfer, no grab rails anywhere. Couldn't find accessible loo in main building, too many steps."
cyril hart arboretum coleford,positive,"Parking areas were available at both places, but must buy a parking ticket for two pounds (2021) Various spots to park by the bridge for lower pond."
dai pai edinburgh,negative,"Not really an accessible toilet. But it has potential, see pictures. "
daisy tasker dundee,positive,"There are accessible and standard parking space available outside the entrance to Daisy Taskers and Hotel Indigo, as far as I can remember there were about 3 accessible parking spaces at each entrance.  Daisy Tasker is located roughly a 15-minute walk from Dundee train station and a 10-minute walk from Dundee bus station. I would also say there are plenty of taxi ranks around Dundee to get a taxi from the train and bus station. The toilet for Daisy Taskers is located within the lobby of Hotel Indigo. I would say that the accessible toilet is fairly spacious but, you would have to move the bin at the left-hand side of the toilet for an easier transfer as there is a sink at the other side that blocks transfer access.  Within the toilet there would be enough room for a wheelchair user to have assistance from someone. There are enough grab rails around the toilet and you can see an image of accessible toilet below.  The closest Changing Place toilet is at the V&A which is open until at least 5pm. "
daisys tea room dawlish,positive,"Daisy's Tea Rooms are located a 5 minute level walk from Dawlish train station. There is step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station.  There are step free, local buses that stop close by."
dakota edinburgh queensferry,positive,Five star. See above. Car park outside main entrance to hotel. Large accessible toilet but heavy door and stiff lock.  Clean.
dakota glasgow glasgow,negative,Being in the heart of Glasgow on street parking can be quite limited. There is an NCP car park on Holland Street which is a few hundred yards away. Due to its proximity to Sauchiehall St. it has a good bus service from most parts of the city. Charing Cross train station is not too far.
dalbeattie forest town wood dalbeattie,negative,No disabled parking I could see but there were several free places to park. It's a loose gravel parking place with a few potholes.
dalby the great yorkshire forest low dalby,positive,Disabled parking spaces available but not clearly signed  Would be 5 but one was out of order at one point 
dales country interiors petworth,negative,Public conveniences in main car park next to disabled parking spaces. Steps to negotiate
dales country interiors petworth,positive,"Car parking spaces available in Market Square, Petworth, outside the shop. Disabled parking bays in main car park which which is 5 minutes from Market Square with 2 small pavements to negotiate."
dalhousie castle hotel bonnyrigg,negative,"My carer drove me and we parked in the car park  We drove and had no problems finding Dalhousie.  Sadly though once we arrived, we realised that it was not accessible ( in a safe way) Was told there was a disabled toilet on first floor but no lift and no means to access"
dalkeith country park dalkeith,negative,"There is accessible parking close to the restaurant/shop area. However, this is not signed at all from the main vehicle entrance so unless you know about it you will end up parking in one of the other, very poorly accessible car parks. Ask for the ""laundry room carpark"" One single accessible toilet near restaurants, not signed. NO disabled loo at the Fort Douglas playpark area despite there being other loos there. No Changing Place."
dalmahoy hotel country club edinburgh,negative,"Disabled parking (2 spaces) but not close. One accessible loo next to reception, loo in room not particularly."
dalriada edinburgh,negative,The bus goes from the high street nearby. I think you can park on streets nearby.
dalwhinnie distillery visitor centre dalwhinnie,positive,"Walking distance from the station.  Bits of the pavement are narrow, sloped and gravelly. Could do with a dropped kerb at the distillery gates.  There are two good- looking disabled parking spaces It's pretty clear and pretty spacious,  room for a carer, clean and tidy. There is an alarm.  Door sticks.  No Changing Places toilet"
dalziel park hotel motherwell,positive,"there are ample disabled parking spaces and the kerb height is low in the entrance area, however there is no public transport to this building"
dance base edinburgh,negative,"Parking is a bit of a nightmare in Grassmarket! There are two blue badge parking spaces nearby though and if they're free then they are about 100m from the entrance. Transport to dancebase was probably its weakest point. There was a bus service running along the Grassmarket and some taxis were in evidence. You do have to walk, or wheel in my case, some distance from any parking space or bus stops. It was worth the effort so worth a try if you can ..."
dance base edinburgh,positive,"A large accessible loo was adjacent to the reception area. The door was wide and easy to use. The lighting was good and the layout worked well for me. There was space for me to manoeuvre my powerchair. All in all a good experience; not always the case in some 'accessible' loos. I've only ever used the accessible toilet at reception because it's closest to my classes. Haven't explored further. Clean, spacious loo with the red cord all the way to the floor. We arrived on public transport. Parking may be tricky in Festival time when its busy but there are parking bays nearby. 2 large sized accessible loos. One on the left as you approach the reception and one up in the changing room area."
dance base scotlands national centre for dance edinburgh,positive,"I have always arrived via public transport. Taxi's can stop right outside the building and there is a bus stop just a minute away from the building. There are accessible toilets on all levels. These are labelled clearly. The toilet seats are yellow which I thought was an unusual colour but when I mentioned this is passing to the reception staff they told me that they run a project for people with parkinsons and that yellow is a good, bright colour that works well for people with parkinsons and dementia. In fact thats why all the furniture in the building is brightly coloured so that it is easily identifiable. I originally just thought it was really cheery!"
danubius hotel london,negative,No disabled parking. Bus passes near hotel
dare valley country park aberdare,positive,Disabled parking close to cafe. Accessible loo in visitor centre
dark horse espresso bar solihull,negative,"Very few parking spaces outside, had to get dropped off and driver parked a few minutes walk away in the park car park."
dark horse espresso bar solihull,positive,"Fairly easy to find, at the back of the cafe. Okay space wise with grab rails however bins in the corner may have posed a problem to some. Very clean and well stocked. Red cord was tied up however I did leave a note about it so will hopefully be rectified."
darlington railway station darlington,negative, There is a bus stop outside the station but the route from that stop to the station entrance involves another incline. There is a good drop off point near the station taxi point which has level access and there are also 3 or 4 parking places for Wheelchair users but those spaces are constantly abused by able bodied people and parking time is limited anyway!  So I always use a taxi which drops me to catch my train and also collects me on return.
darlington railway station darlington,positive,The venues for disabled parking is just adjucent to the main short corridor to the train station and is very accessible. Public transport appears to support more of those who use taxis becuase the drop off point is also near to the corridor. The bus stop is not to far away as well. There is a clear sign and easily accessible.
darwin brasserie london,positive,The Sky Garden is about a 15 minute (max) push from London Bridge Station which is completely wheelchair accessible. There is no disabled parking in the location. There were two spacious accessible and clean toilets. 
darwin shopping centre shrewsbury,positive,"The one disabled toilet is a bit small but there is a large changing station room with full facilities, shower, hoist etc "
dataran merdeka kuala lumpur,positive,We walked there from where we were staying nearby. There is the Masjid Jamek LRT Station nearby. It would be easy enough to get dropped off by taxi there too.
david bann edinburgh,negative,Not good we parked and walked to the venue
david lloyd glasgow west end glasgow,positive,I drove and parked straight outside the main door in the disabled bays 
davys at canary wharf london,positive,Step free from the promenade by the dock although two doors to navigate. Loo is to the left of the main bar. Large room. Red cord was tied to the grabrail when visited.
dawlish dawlish,positive,"Dawlish Railway Station has step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station. There are also local, step free buses serve the town. There are 2 public accessible toilets, which require radar keys. One is nextdoor to the tourist information office and the other is at the bottom of Barton Hill, and this one if locked in the evening.  Both toilets are spacious, clean tidy and have grab rails. The accessible toilet next to the tourist information office also has an emergency cord."
dawlish museum dawlish,positive,"The nearest train station is Dawlish, which is a 10 minute walk away. There is step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station. The museum is located on a hill. There is an adjacent car park to the museum. Local buses stop nearby. There is a large, clean, accessible toilet with grab rails on the ground floor."
dawlish sea wall walk   dawlish to coryton cove dawlish,positive,"Dawlish Railway Station runs parallel to the sea wall walk and next to the station there is a step free access to the sea wall. The station has step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station.

There are also step free buses from Dawlish Warren. There are accessible, public toilets both at Dawlish and Coryton Cove. I used the ones at Dawlish and they were very clean, spacious, with grab rails. I didn't use the toilets at Coryton Cove."

dawno temu na kazimierzu krakow,positive,"The road parallel to the restaurant is a main road which has trams running along. I didn't use the tram while I was there so unable to comment, apart from I noticed that the new trams had wheelchair signs by one of the doors."
day lewis pharmacy warley,positive,2 disabled parking spaces right outside. Normally plenty of parking available in the rest of the car park which is shared with the doctor's surgery and SNAP. Bus stop on Warley Hill accessible but not great as quite a long walk or push to the stop on medium gradiant.
days inn liverpool city centre liverpool,positive,James St is a Metro link as a result as well as the station there are a number of local buses that stop outside or near to the hotel. There is also a Taxi rank at the door and all of the Taxi we used could take a wheelchair so no need to book one as there was normal 3 in the rank. There is no on street parking due to the number of buses etc in the area The toilet in the room was large and had the standard grip rails around the toilets and shower you expect in a hotel  There is a fold down seat in the shower that is set at a standard level they  normal are  when you switch the bedroom lights off at night a Green safety light comes on in the toilet that allows you to see with out putting lights on during the night  The only problem was the Red cord was around 2 feet short of the floor I did leave a Red Cord Card in place
days inn wetherby,positive,"Lots of disabled parking outside lodge but it is shared with the service area so can get busy at certain times of day.  There is an accessible loo in the reception area but we've never used it so can't comment on how good it is, but the rooms all have great wetrooms with level entry and doors that open fully."
de bokkesprong groet,positive,"If arriving by public transportation, Groet is accessible by bus from the Alkmaar train station. If you have special needs, be sure to call in advance to ensure the bus is suitable for your needs.  If arriving by taxi, the company Accessible Travel Netherlands can make arrangements for you.  If traveling by car, accessible parking is available near the restaurant.  The restaurant can also be accessed from many of the bicycle trails in the area. A wheelchair accessible toilet is located inside the restaurant."
de rechtbank utrecht,negative,"There is no parking in the old town.  We had booked to stay at the attached Court House Hotel (parking for the hotel was about 20 minutes (able bodied) walk away, but we were able to park briefly outside to unload - and then the next day to pack up and leave).  My advice would be to get a taxi - or go by mobility scooter.  I also doubt any buses go down these narrow streets."
dean heritage centre forest of dean,positive,"Beautiful forest scenery takes you to the starting point, sometimes along busy roads, but it’s also quiet on some, and you cannot miss the sign to say you have arrived. There are three disabled bays available just yards after arriving, but if full, the main free car park is just a few more yards away."
dean park hotel kirkcaldy,positive,Special parking bays right next to the doors Three loos for weelchairs If you don't have a car it is quite tricky to get to by bus. There is disabled parking at the hotel. There is a disabled loo in the restaurant. There is one disabled access hotel room out of 33 rooms in total.
deanes at queens belfast,negative,Street parking only and at busy times during the week it can be hard to find a parking space. 
deanes at queens belfast,positive,"Large disabled toilet just of the large entrance hall, with plenty of room for a wheelchair . Grab rails at the basin. However, doubles as a baby changing area."
deans cafe bistro huntly,positive,"Big car park right outside with accessible spaces. The ground is a little bumpy and the path a bit narrow up to the front door, but it's a very quiet street."
deans community high school livingston,positive,There is a whole area for disabled to park There are toilets all over the high school for disabled people
debenhams dunfermline,positive,"Parking in The Kingsgate multi story. Prices have been slashed so don't be afraid to use it. Shopmobility on lower ground. Phone ahead and they will meet you with a scooter 01383 661455 Roomy toilet, well signposted. Usual fittings. The red cord was 90cm of floor but supervisor said she would see to it. "
debenhams edinburgh,negative,One decent accessible loo available. Plenty handrails. Decent amount of room to transfer.
debenhams edinburgh,positive,"Parking is available in dedicated blue badge bays in the adjacent car park. Leaving the car park you can be in the store in just a few metres. Accessible buses serve the shopping centre. Clean, spacious accessible loo within the store. Doubles as baby change, but still reasonably spacious."
debenhams exeter,positive,could have been bigger - no changing bench of any type and was difficult to do a 360 degree turn.
debenhams newport,positive,"There are lots of parking underneath the store, although it does get busy on the weekend.  They have accessible toilets, which are accessible on the 2nd floor next to the cafe."
debenhams perth,negative,Easy to find but too small and short red cord. Rails ok. Bins obstruct any transferring Main Street was full disabled spaces near centre had parking that did not display a blue badge so it was hard for us to park  Not Good . The cafe was good with this although it faces onto the cafe making it off putting for customers and disabled in access as you again have to pass tables and chairs to go round to toilet and it faces outward to cafe. I took my mobility car and found no parking near the store. Also some of the car parks are small with only two or three disabled spaces meaning I had to park further away. This is not great when the weather is bad.
debenhams perth,positive,"See my last answer The toliets is very nice, they were clean and tidy with lots of room for my electric wheelchiar which made moving around easy. Good disbaled toliet."
debenhams salisbury,negative,Plenty of space but no grab rails.
debenhams salisbury,positive,"We used the Britford park and ride. It has disabled parking spaces and the single decker buses are wheelchair friendly, and the drivers are very helpful. The only negative is that if you’re pushing a wheelchair the path from the bus back to the disabled parking is very steep. Salisbury city centre is all on the level and , apart from a few wonky pavements, there’s no problem pushing the wheelchair round."
debenhams york,negative,"The shop is easily accessible by bus with bus stops spread around the city centre. Taxis can also drive all the way up to the outside of the shop if needed. The pavement and road surface around the shop and in York city centre isn't very wheelchair user friendly, due to uneven pavements and cobbles."
decathlon renfrew,negative,"It is relatively easy to get there.  If you to get the bus, there is only a 5 minute walk from the shop.  There is about half a dozen disabled parking available. There are dropped kerbs for crossing the road."
decathlon sports shop glasgow,positive,Plenty of disabled parking bays but (as with a number of venues) the lowered kerbs could be improved.
deep sea world north queensferry,negative,"The accessibility at Deep Sea World was great but unfortunately the toilets let it down. I had to ask twice where to find them as they weren't well signposted. It did not have a radar key lock and was quite unclean. There was no red cord. I barely fit in in my powerchair, there was a bin infront of me and no space to manoeuvre (see pics). The lock was a bit dodgy and I was a bit worried it wouldn't hold if someone tried to get in. There were grab rails at each side but no space to transfer at the side of the toilet. The door was quite heavy and slammed shut making getting out (backwards!) a difficulty. In the two halls next to each other where the toilets were, there were at least rooms for toilets, the centre would certainly benefit from a more accessible toilet for people with disabilities. A larger accessible toilet, with less clutter, a radar key entry and a red cord would certainly make a vast improvement.  Loo could have been a lot better. Tight for a manual chair with limited room for a carer etc. Grab rails in place (the wall mounted ones which swing up and down). Took a little manoevering to get back out again, backwards and I caught my handles on the door frame as I did so.  The parking is near the slope down to the venue but there are quite big kerbs in the car park and only one ramp that I saw. The disabled parking could be nearer to the entrance. Not needed"
deep sea world north queensferry,positive,"We travelled by car and parked in the disabled bays. There's a ramp to get up to the pavement then a long ramp round the corner to get down to the entrance. The car park has a row of disabled spaces and all access is level right into the venue. The car park is free for all. The train stops at North Queensferry and it's downhill all the way to Deep Sea World, on the return there's ramp access to the station beyond the stairs. If travelling by bus from either direction there's a lot of stairs (over 50) so it's better to go to park and ride in Inverkeithing and take a taxi from there We got a bit lost due to roadworks but it wasn't too difficult to find otherwise! It took us an hour coming from Glasgow. It was roomy, very clean, with grab rails and an emergency cord in place. No hoisting equipment or changing facilities."
deichmann shoes blackpool,positive,There is a multi store car park attached to the shopping centre it has Blue badge spaces available. Access from the car park to the centre is via a lift. The nearest Tram Stop will be the Tower this is a few minutes walk away . There are no toilets available in the store however there are two wheelchair access toilets available at the food court area on the upper floor two lifts service this area.
del amo fashion center torrance,negative,"All toilets at the mall have at least one disabled toilet. However, the disabled toilets have no items/equipment. The only difference is, it has a larger stall. "
del amo fashion center torrance,positive,"Del amo fashion mall is located on Hawthorne Blvd. It has numerous car parks with ample amount of disabled parking at each car park. Most people drive to the mall, hence the 12,000 parking spaces, however several busses also stop at the mall.  The car parks are large allowing easy parking access for those who travel in large size vehicles. "
deli x london,negative,"There is a single stall, gender neutral, wheelchair accessible loo. However, because it's also used as a baby change it's sometimes dirty."
deli x london,positive,Very close to Deptford Train Station which is wheelchair accessible and has a lift.
delibo les bains plage restaurant villefranche sur mer,negative,We arrived by ships tender. There is a car park close by. The railway station is just above the Marina but Villefranche is very hilly with lots of steps. 
dell farquharson community leisure centre dunfermline,negative,"clean , large enough for wheelchairs. Locking for toilets not a D handle and a bit fiddly to lock/unlock.  "
dell farquharson community leisure centre dunfermline,positive,good rail and bus links. train station five minutes away and bus stop right outside the building. Clear parking bays with disabled parking 
delphinus at xel ha tulum,positive,"We were picked up at the front door of our hotel from a booked minibus for a very reasonable price. However, it's also possible to get there via public colectivo. The busses were easy to spot and the drivers were very helpful.  The accessible toilets were at the start of the park. They were clean and well kept, as well as spacious. Other, non-accessible toilets were situated frequently and well sign posted throughout the park and I was able to use these frequently. "
delta hotels by marriott warwick warwick,negative,"Easy to find disabled toilets as close to reception desk, but mens or ladies do have push doors to worry about, I personally had to get off my wheelchair to get inside and to then get into disabled toilet, so disappointing there. The toilet was clean and tidy, with grab rails and pull cord, and you can spin your chairs inside, if you managed to have a Carer with you to help get into the toilet."
delta hotels by marriott warwick warwick,positive,"Big carpark area, with 11 disabled bays available, reasonably near to entrance, ok if a dry day, it is very close to the M40 motorway, so ideal if passing through, or you need a break somewhere for a drink. You cannot hear the motorway by the way."
denbies wine estate dorking,positive,"The ground floor accessible toilet has a light door.  It is spacious and has a mirror, sink and hand dryer at be correct height. The only negative is the height of the flush handle which is impossible to reach from a wheelchair. Plenty of disabled parking spaces right outside the venue plus space to drop people off at the entrance if necessary.  There is a Land Rover tour of the vineyard (to the top of the hill with views) for those who have limited mobility. All on ground level - have not looked for/used any disabled toilet so cannot comment on this."
dens park dundee,negative,"Unfortunately there is no parking provided at the football ground, and so fans who wish to arrive by car must find on-street parking nearby. There is, however, an accessible bus that runs from Dundee City Centre up to the ground - perfect for any disabled fans looking to head in via public transportation. "
dens park dundee,positive,"The disabled toilets were fairly standard, and much like what you'll find at most other sports venues around the country (see pic)."
derbion derby,positive,"Intu shopping centre has a large car park with several different entrances depending upon which way you approach the city. The car park has several levels and each has a number of disabled spaces situated close to the entrance and the lifts down to the shopping levels of the centre.  The bus station is not far from the centre if walking (approximately 5 minutes) with access available directly onto the ground floor. There are large disabled toilets available on both levels of the shopping centre, and at two different locations per level. Toilets are regularly cleaned and provide a grab rail. We drove to the Intu Centre, the car park was large with various disabled spaces on the different levels all near the entrance to the shopping centre, lifts are also close to the disabled spaces.  The location of the bus station is walking distance to the Intu Shopping Centre (approx. 5/10 mins, depending on which entrance). The bus station is all one level with two easily accessible entrances and exits. The toilets in the Intu Centre are regularly checked and cleaned to ensure high standard of hygiene. The disabled toilets are wide in order to complete manovers and a carer would be able to fit in them if necessary. Grab rails and an emegerncy cord is provided to ensure maximum safety to prevent risk of injury and harm. There is parking at Into Derby and the levels are easily accessible by the lift.  Intu has 161 accessible bays over 4 different car parks but there is a charge. There is on street parking that is free to blue badge holders but it is often full.   The bus station is located near by and there are many seating areas for resting as you walk towards the centre.   Shop Mobility is located opposite bus station if you need to hire a scooter or powered wheelchair (there is a fee) to access Derby as the centre is large.  There is 1 changing places toilet with plenty of room for carers. The changing place toilet requires a radar key to access. It is located between Debenhams and Marks & Spencer. The main corridor does not sign post towards it.   Another accessible loo is on level 1 near entrance to eagle market.   On level 2 there are 2 disabled loos between food court and TGI Fridays one has radar key access. There are also two more loos next to Mark & Spencer's on level 2 one of which is also radar key access.   Next to the changing place toilet is a small accessible loo.   In total there are 5 disabled loos that I know of. They aren't all the same size. The ones I've been in difficult to turn in with limited transfer space."
derby arena derby,positive,"There is free parking, disabled bays and wheelchair accessible buses to and from the arena, outside the main entrance.  There are no parking bays close to main doors. There is a lowered car park payment machine too.   In entrance hall there is a disabled changing room which is accessed by radar key. There is also a shower. Toilet has grab rails and is a right hand transfer. There is a shower seat attached to the wall. There is an emergency alarm cord. There is no locker or place to put your clothes during shower. There was enough space for a carer and it was clean.   The changing places toilet is accessed by going through the cafeteria. The doors are electronic with a touch button to open. There are several disabled  changing areas in this section however only one changing places. To access changing places toilet you need to turn right and you need a radar key. There is a hoist and changing table as well as a toilet and shower which can be accessed via the hoist. There is no shower wheelchair. They also have a toilet next to changing places toilet with electronically opening doors. I had to ask where the changing places toilet was as the corridor seemed to to on forever.  Most of the toilets/changing rooms in this area were not locked. I didn't check them all out as there was a lot of them. One of them had a counter if you needed the support to brush hair etc. "
derby bus station derby,negative,There is an accessible loo accessed via a radar key.   The toilet is right hand transfer (or left when in wheelchair). Grab rails are white and around sink & toilet. There is enough space to turn a large powerchair around. There is no bag hook.   Since complaining the radar lock has been repaired and the loo was clean.    The nearest changing places toilet is Derby Intu and the council house. 
derby bus station derby,positive,"Both coaches and buses go from this station. The majority are wheelchair accessible, however Trent Barton Spondon Flyer and Arriva 5a I think it is, are tiny and not easy to access in a larger power chair. Buses go all over Derby and connect to Nottingham also. The coaches go all over the UK and you can also get a bus to East Midlands Airport 24/7. There is also an accessible bus run by High Peak buses that can take you to Matlock & Buxton.   Other than the Red Arrow you can use your concessionary bus pass on the buses.  Some buses have visual stop display and/or audio stop. Sadly this isn't that common.   National Express which runs from the station are wheelchair accessible however the coach companies such as Skills are not.   There are taxis outside, however the ramps are unmaintained and like cliffs. They are also too small for larger powerchairs and you do take your life into your own hands if you want to access them in a larger powerchair especially.   Derby Train Station is a 15 minute walk at a moderate pace. There are buses that go from Derby Bus Station to outside the train station. "
derby city council derby,negative,I do not drive so unsure about the parking - although parking in Derby centre isn't easy.  The Council offices are well served by buses. 
derby city council derby,positive,"The signage isn't great; a member of staff directed me to the toilet.  Accessed by radar key, this is a fully furnished 'changing places' loo, with a hoist, padded bed and shower - and instructions on how to use the equipment are included.  There is ample space for a wheelchair and for more than one person.  My only gripe was that the absence of a toilet roll holder meant toilet paper had been placed on the cistern and was difficult to reach."
derby city council headquarters derby,positive,"Nearest bus station is 5 minute walk away. Derby Train Station is about 20 minutes walk away or you can get wheelchair accessible buses. There is a car park with is accessed via a barrier. The parking is not free for badge holders.  On ground floor there is one small wheelchair accessible loo. Just enough space to turn around in a power chair. There is grab rails around toilet and sink with lowered hand dryer, mirror and hook. Accessed using a radar key. Toilet is left hand transfer but there is a large bin in the way.  Male and female toilets have braille labels.   There is also a changing places toilet. "
derby market hall derby,negative,Toilet was through heavy fire door. Toilet was access with a radar key but I didn't enter as it was creepy. White grab rails around toilet and sink. Toilet was left side transfer but two bin were next to it. There was also a baby changing table. Nearest changing places toilet is in council house or Intu Derby. 
derby market hall derby,positive,There is disabled parking outside the market which is free. Derby Bus Station is a few minutes walk away.
derby midland railway station derby,negative,The toilet is located through the barriers and on platform 1. As you come through the electric doors it is on the right. Toilet is locked with a radar key. This toilet was tiny. There was a large bin in the transfer space and there was no space to turn around in my large power chair. There were grab rails around the sink. There was no mirror or hook. Toilet flush handle was small.  There are other loos on other platforms.
derby midland railway station derby,positive,The station has two entrances both of which have disabled parking bays. There are buses that run to the station from Derby Bus Station. 
derby museum art gallery derby,positive,There is on street parking available which is free to badge holders. Derby bus station is about 10 minutes walk away and train station about 30 minutes walk away. There are bus stops a few minutes walk away to some areas.  Toilet on level 1 has an electric opening door. Not much turning space or room for a second person. Silver grab rails around toilet and sink. Toilet is left side transfer. Toilet and sink have sensors to use. Nearest changing places toilet is Derby Council House or Intu Derby.
derbyshire royal infirmary resource centre derby,positive,Disabled parking bays outside building. Bus stop (The Royal One) stops inside the hospital grounds. This bus is small but my powerchair fits on. 
derwent rural counselling service derby,negative,There is on street parking outside but no wide disabled bays. The nearest bus station is about 10 minutes walk away.  There was a small loo in the building of which my powered wheelchair could not fit. There were rails around toilet but it wasn't wheelchair accessible unless you have a really small chair. Nearest changing places toilet is located in council house or Intu Derby.
derwentwater keswick,negative,"Theatre on the Lake and adjoining restaurant have disabled toilets but I have found them to be rather small, particularly in the Theatre. Signs are also small."
derwentwater keswick,positive,Dedicated parking but easily walkable if staying in Keswick. Loads of blue badge spaces near the start at the lakeside car park. Follow signs from main road. There is a cafe at the start that is accessible and new so I’m hoping they’d be ok.
design museum london,negative,There is no accessible London Underground station but there are regular buses.
design museum london,positive,"Excellent, modern, spacious and with automatic doors. The Design Museum is located on Kensington High Street and is next to Holland Park.    The nearest tube is High Street Kensington, which is not step free, as it involves a flight of stairs with handrails to exit/ enter all its platforms. If you do use High Street Kensington tube exit the station, walk through the small shopping centre immediately in front of you and on exiting onto the street turn left. It's about a 5 - 8 minute walk and the museum is on the opposite side of street to the tube station. It is a level road with drop kerbs, but remember this is a busy shopping street.  There are a number of buses that stop very close by. Very impressive accessible toilet on the ground floor. It had push button doors, although you had to manually lock the toilet door. It was spacious, clean, with grab rails and emergency cord. It would have been nice if this brand new museum had installed a Changing Places toilet and then it would have enabled more disabled people to enjoy the museum."
deutsches historisches museum berlin,positive,"By 2019 there will be an U-bahn station very close to the building. The nearest at present is at Alexanderplatz, about 10 minutes level wheel/walk away. Bus 100 stops close to the museum on Unter den Linde. The bus route links many of the major tourist sites in Berlin (e.g. Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag building & zoo) and buses can get very crowded, making life tricky for wheelchair users. We used the accessible loos in the Arsenal and in the the new building. Both were clean, reasonably spacious, equipped with grab rails both side of the loo and wheelchair accessible washbasin. Both had single alarm cords at the side of the loo stretching to within 18"" of the floor. In both loos it would be possible to side transfer onto the loo from either side. Someone had turned off the light in the loo in the Arsenal and I had to use my phone as a torch to find the switch. It's on the left, just inside the door."
devilla alloa,positive,"There is a Forestry Commission car park with several disabled parking bays. Cars park on gravel/stones, but as a powerchair user, I exit my car from the back via a ramp so I don't find the stones an issue because I exit onto the tarmac. However, wheelchair users who exit the car via the side doors into a manual wheelchair may find the stones an issue. Once off the parking bay, you are on a  tarmac path.  There are 3 disabled car parking spaces, with plenty of additional parking. Well signposted. However, there is large gravel to the sides of the car, so you couldn't easily wheel a scooter or wheelchair on this surface (not a problem if you access your device from the boot)."
dewsbury sports centre dewsbury,positive,There is disabled parking spaces available outside the sports centre.  There are disabled toilets in the reception of the sports centre and in the swimming pool area. 
di maggios glasgow,positive,Parking is available across the street in the multi-storey car park. As I didn't travel by car I can't comment further. Fine - all on the level and very close to the restaurant seating area.
dig   an archaeological adventure york,negative,"Radar key from reception. Accessed through one push door into small foyer area and then folding door into 'accessible' toilet.  There is a drop down hand rail to one side of toilet and horizontal hand rail on wall.  There are no hoisting facilities. Depending on the size of the wheel chair, there is little turning space . For us there was not enough space to close the door while carer and wheel chair user was in there-luckily we were only washing hands!"
dig   an archaeological adventure york,positive,"Located in York city centre, The Dig is conveniently accessible whether travelling by public transport or driving and parking.  Stone bow and Piccadilly bus stops, just a few minutes walk. There are numerous car parks close by with disabled parking bays (Shamblers multi-storey car park less than a 5 minute walk)."
digby chick stornoway,positive,We parked in a disabled bay off the Main Street then it was all flat & pedestrianised to get to the restaurant.  Accessible toilet was easy to negotiate & was nice & clean. Suitable grab rails & emergency cord in place. Plenty of room to move around in a wheelchair & to transfer.
diggerland rochester,positive,Decent blue badge spaces near the ramp up to the entrance. Might get a bit full on busy days.
dimora glasgow,negative,"Small car park with one disabled space. If you're lucky enough to get that place, then access good. Otherwise a bit of a struggle as limited street parking. Bus stop nearby."
dimora glasgow,positive,"Providing you are on ground floor all is level, chairs widely spaced in the front part of the restaurant but more crowded in the rear conservatory"
dingwall leisure centre dingwall,positive,Car park to the side of the Centre with 4 disabled spaces. There is a disabled toilet by the lift through a push door. it's quite small but usually quite clean. if you want a shower you can use the wetside changing downstairs.
disability snowsport uk dsuk glasgow renfrew,negative,The accessibile toilet in this venue is not great for wheelchair users. The toilet itself has a good turning circle to move around. However a lot of the main hadrails have been removed. This makes transferring very difficult. This really is an issue that needs to be addressed. As an alternative there are more accessible toilets and changing places toilets in Breahead shopping centre next door 
disability snowsport uk dsuk glasgow renfrew,positive,Soar at Breahead is very accessible by car with lots of disabled parking spaces available. 
disability snowsport uk glenmore,positive,Large car park with parking right outside Disability Snowsports office.    We used a taxi from our hotel in Aviemore where we stayed following our 9 hour train journey to Aviemore - worth it as train journey alone was an adventure with wonderful scenery through Scotland.  
discovery museum newcastle upon tyne,negative,"There is disabled parking bays directly outside of the museum entrance, however these are public parking spaces also used by  members of the public who do not use the museum, this increases the risk there not being a disabled bay available on arrival. There are not loads of parking spaces"
discovery museum newcastle upon tyne,positive,"Based in the City Centre of Newcastle - there are a lot of Transport options available to you.  Metro - the local underground style train service is cheap, accessible and mostly(!) reliable with the nearest Station being Central Station. This is a 10-15 minute accessible walk or roll to the Discovery Museum.  Bus - local Bus Stations include Haymarket and Eldon Square with quite a long walk to the Museum from either station. I’d recommend this route if you wanted to see the sights of Newcastle or stop for lunch on the way to the Venue.   There are some closer stops available via local route services and all Public Transport in and around the North East should be Accessible and includes spaces for at least one chair.  Parking - There are a limited number of Disabled parking bays available here - definitely something that could be improved. But the few that are here are close to the entrance, have ample space around them and don’t have any obstructions to the entrance.  There is a Changing Places toilet available here making it the only Museum in the City which currently has one.   This can’t be praised enough!  There are also plenty of Accessible Toilets available on every other floor - and within the Male and Female toilets. As seen in the photos the male Accessible Toilet has several grab rails, a slightly raised toilet and a handrail. There is also enough room to move around in a chair - but you may struggle to turn quickly.  There is a car park directly outside the museum with accessible parking bays, although in busy times this will probably fill up quite quickly. It is also walking distance from Newcastle Central Station (between 5 and 10 minute walk) and there are public bus links nearby. There is a changing places toilet on the ground floor, plus accessible toilets in the female (and I assume also the male) toilet(s). The doors into the toilets are automatic, the accessible toilet itself is a manual door and opens inwards, it's fairly spacious once inside (it's a long space) - see photograph below. Only gripe is it could have done with being cleaned as there were paper towels all over the floor. There are disabled toilets available on most of the floors which have suitable hand rails fitted to allow safe transfers by disabled people There are a limited number of disabled bays outside the museum but plenty of public car parks with disabled bays close by. There are plenty of spacious and well-equipped accessible toilets throughout the museum. The accessible toilet on the first floor has a bed and a hoist."
discovery point dundee,positive,"There is a car park beside the coffee shop with plenty disabled car parking spaces. Personally, I travelled via the train and Dundee train station is directly opposite the coffee shop.  I git the train through from Glasgow, and despite major works going on in and around the station, the journey was perfect.   The station is directly across the street from the entrance of discovery point. The accessible loo was well equipped, clean and spacious enough for me. Would still be better if they had a changing places loo though.   Special mention as they had an EG red cord card in the loos. Council car park right beside Discovery Point, 3 disabled spaces and if you have a blue badge there's no charge to park here. Only downfall there was is that there isn't a safe walkway to get on to the pavement so small risk with cars driving in car park.   Right across the road is the train station so no distance at all to get to here if you were traveling by train. Actually the reason I went here because was meeting Ryan MacDonald from Euan's Guide and he traveled by train.   Also right in the city centre so bus stops and taxi ranks nearby.  Disabiled toilet was right at entrance of museum. I didn't use it myself and lots half a star because it's not a changing place toilet.  Good amount of parking close by.  The train station is a 5 minute walk (maximum) across the road.  Unsure about the bus service as I didn’t use it."
discovery quay dundee,positive,Not only is it right opposite the station but it also has a car park right outside it with Blue Badge parking. Accessible loo in the foyer area. Single door to enter with plenty of turning space. Grabrails and low level fixtures & fittings. Clean & tidy.
dishoom edinburgh,positive,"Dishoom is located in the centre of  the city. We parked in a Disabled space outside the restaurant.  There are plenty of bus stops nearby .The tram is close. The Waverley train station is close. The disabled toilet is  on the lower floor of the building .  It can be accessed  by wheelchair users by using the lift.  There is an emergency red record .  See photos for more details . The restaurant is close to accessible public transport links, including a nearby Edinburgh Tram stop and various Lothian busses which pass by on Princes Street or near the Square. There is a car park around the other side of the Square.  Drove in car, parked with blue badge in George Street. I came by car, parked each time with blue badge on George Street."
disley community centre disley,positive,There is more than sufficient disabled parking.
disneyland paris chessy,negative,We used a shuttlebus - great in terms of door to door but not wheelchair accessible.  My son has learning disabilty - we were invited to sit at the front and he enjoyed the view. All seats had seat belts and the bus had a loo.
disneyland paris chessy,positive,"Available throught site, clearly matked and all well maintained. Some invluded changing area."
disneyland park anaheim,negative,Parking is very dispersed although there is parking bays near the shuttle bus to the main gate. It would be more effort than other places  A taxi might be a better option as this can get you closer in straight away.
disneyland park anaheim,positive,Accessible toilets available throughout the park
disneys animal kingdom kissimmee,positive,"Disney's Animal Kingdom is recognised world-wide, therefore becomes extremely busy during peak holiday times. Although Disney's Animal Kingdom provides disabled parking spaces for guests who choose to drive, I would recommend using the resort's bus transportation. Every bus included is adapted to fully accommodate wheelchair users and prioritises guests, which require these services to the front of the queue. Unfortunately this is only available for a limited amount of spaces per journey. Every driver I had met was extremely friendly and patient and no task was too much trouble. As well as visual indication, the driver would announce every stop for each hotel and theme park, which would be beneficial for guests with visual and hearing disabilities. All stops were opposite the main entrances.  The accessible toilets were easy to locate and clearly marked."
disneys newport bay club hotel chessy,negative,"The Disney hotels bus service definitely isn't super easy to use due to the fact the staff are not very accommodating. All the buses are now equipped with a ramp and a on board wheelchair space, but actually getting into that space can be difficult if there is a large crowd."
disneys newport bay club hotel chessy,positive,"Very spacious, well equipped and very clean!"
disneys port orleans resort   riverside orlando,positive,"Riverside offer reliable bus transportation. The buses, equipped with electronic ramps, are spacious, air conditioned and have a priority area for guests using wheelchairs and mobility scooters. The bus drivers are happy to give priority boarding to disabled guests and allow disabled guests to board with their party, ensuring they do not feel isolated.   Riverside offer disabled parking close to the resort; the parking spaces are wide offering extra room for easier maneuvering. "
disneys typhoon lagoon water park orlando,positive,At least they got this right
distinto leeds,positive,"In town, so good public transport links, but unsure for parking due to lack of parking places in town. "
divertimenti london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby, I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area, and several bus routes run very close by. (It is baffling - and scandalous - that the nearest station, South Kensington, is *still* not step-free.)"
divino enoteca edinburgh,negative,We got the bus so I'm not sure about parking. The bus drops off on Chambers Street and it's a pretty steep hill down from there and then cobbled road outside the restaurant. Taxis can drop off easily outside.
divino enoteca edinburgh,positive,Very spacious toilets and very clean.
djanogly cafe london,positive,There are 2 large accessible toilets in the gallery on the ground floor.
dnisi glasgow,positive,Bus stop next to shop and nice flat and safe pavements for accessing with wheelchair. 
doagh famine village lagacurry,positive,Big car park outside the museum with plenty of spaces. Bit tatty but big and clean with enough rails for me.
dobbies garden centre broxburn,positive,"Plenty of blue badge car spaces, but it gets very busy and these fill up quickly (often with mum's and kids who don't have badges but want a space near the entrance)."
dobbies garden centre dalgety bay,negative,Limited parking area so only 2 spaces for blue badges but they are right next to the door. There is an accessible loo and it's easy to get to.
dobbies garden centre dundee,positive,"Lots of disabled spaces but can be very busy. Large disabled toilet downstairs.  Not well signed.  I think there is also a disabled toilet by the upstairs restaurant but the sign has been removed. Good sized car park and near a bus stop. There is a bus stop just outside the car park. I always go by car, there are about ten disabled parking bays surrounding the entrance with lines at the side but not the back.  The toilet is difficult to find, not well signposted. It is huge! Plenty of space to move around. There are grab rails, it’s always clean and tidy. "
dobbies garden centre perth,positive,"There is disabled parking close to the doors, there is a lift up to the clothes department and everywhere is flat with minimal bumps. There is a bus to Dobbies from Perth. Large car park with disabled parking near the door, nearby bus stop Toilet is large, easy to get in and out, room to turn. It has grab rails and a red cord. It was clean and tidy"
dobbies garden centre restaurant edinburgh,negative,"These are dotted all round the centre and are good, decent size and easy to access - watch out for the outer door though!"
dobbies garden centre restaurant edinburgh,positive,"Superb - although a bit out of the way', the venue is on a major bus route and there is a good, large car park with dedicated disabled spaces (but you my have to drive around to find a space). Bus stops nearby. Car parking good."
dobbies garden centre stirling,positive,"Plenty disabled bays right outside the door. Well set out, though a very wet floor around the toilet which made me nervous of sliding.  Also the baby changing area was a whole bench top which took up a lot of floor space as it wasn't folding. Plenty of disabled spaces but these are always very busy 2 disabled toilets.  Loads of disabled parking spaces. As they should be and already fitted with a red cord card."
dobbies garden world barlborough,positive,Plenty of free disabled parking spaces. Modern building with modern toilets
dobbies garden world renfrew,negative,"Unfortunately, at the time we visited my husband didn't use the disabled toilet.  The location of it was fine, there were grab rails and there would be plenty of room for a carer, if required, however there was toilet paper on the floor and the toilet itself was unusable in that the toilet seat was wet.   We did speak to a member of staff who was very apologetic, apologising to both myself and my husband, and immediately went to rectify the situation.  (We must add that this is a common problem with disabled toilets and that it wouldn't stop us visiting the store again.)"
dobbies garden world renfrew,positive,Parking is sometimes a problem and more disabled bays would definitely be beneficial. Absolutely perfect at the restaurant part but a lot of people don't know there is another one at the opposite side of the store - it could maybe be signposted somewhere the front entrance or at checkouts. There are plenty of disabled spaces close to the entrance but for those without disabled badges there are plenty of car spaces available. We travelled by car so cannot comment on public transport.  There are plenty of disabled spaces available.  It's easily located just off the M8 motorway.
dobbies ponteland,positive,Plenty of disabled parking close to the entrance/exit.  There is a disabled toilet clearly signed at the front of the shop. The toilet has numerous grab rails and room to manoeuvre. The toilets were clean and tidy on my visit.
doc ferrys bar dundee,positive,"There are council car parks/on street parking close by and taxi rank is also nearby. There are also plenty of buses that pass through Broughty Ferry on regular basis. A train station is also situated in Broughty Ferry although I don’t know anything about how often they stop, I know it’s not that much though."
dock park dumfries,positive,Large carpark with several dedicated accessible spaces. There is a public bus stop nearby.
docklands canal boat trust london,positive,"Free cark parking at the home mooring for the duration of your trip A little tight and must be able to transfer. Support rails and shower stool. Toilet flush on pedal. Remember, this is a boat, carrying it's own water supply so ""ship shower"" so you don't run out!"
doctor who   time fracture london,positive,The disabled toilet was fine for me in a mobility scooter.
doctors edinburgh,negative,Really good bus links - not sure about parking.
dohany street synagogue budapest,positive,"Can't say much about parking, but public transport is good. The synagogue is in a very central location with lots of buses passing by. "
dolphin shopping centre poole,negative,There are numerous disabled parking spaces in the multi-storey car-park attached to the centre but you still have to pay unless you have a motability vehicle. There are streets very nearby where you can park for free (if there are any spaces).
dolphin shopping centre poole,positive,"To use you need an Access key (around £1.50 on web) or go to the visitors room 2 or 3 doors away to get a returnable key.  Large, but not massive, loo has grab rails and a pull-down toilet support rail. It is usually kept clean (never seen it dirty and have used it numerous times).  "
dolphin spirit inverness inverness,positive,"We traveled to the dolphin spirt via a car. There maybe was a disabled car parking space but we couldn't see as most car parking spaces were full.  Large open ground car parking close to marina office  Parking was really good with lots of spaces, however, there is no accessible bus service to the venue.  They do have a minibus service for people who can use it."
dominion cinema edinburgh,negative,There is only off street parking and it is usually hard to find a space. There are many bus stops near the venue. The parking is probably fine.  But that doesn’t change the accessibility. On street parking and regular busses to Morningside. Not a very well-lit street outside the cinema.
don arancini london,positive,We arrived by train and there was step-free access to the shopping centre. No toilets in the Deli but there are plenty of accessible toilets in the shopping centre.
doncaster 8 8 health centre doncaster,positive,"There is a specific undercover disabled parking area which gives easy access to disabled users through an automatic door. There are a number of toilets on all 3 floors in this building, both disabled accessible and ordinary toilets. On the ground floor there is an excellent changing toilet area with fully function ceiling hoist and shower facilities"
donna nook nature reserve louth,positive,"We parked in the main car park which is now accessible for wheelchairs.  If that is full however, the overflow car park is in a field so would not be so easy."
dorking halls dorking,negative,"There is a good accessible toilet; spacious, with enough time to get around . I cannot remember whether there is a hoist or not. There is only one accessible toilet so it can frustrating when it is busy."
dorking halls dorking,positive,There is a spacious car park at the back of the leisure centre next door. I've never had any issues parking there.
dorking museum heritage centre dorking,positive,"There is a disabled space for 1 car beside museum. Behind the museum is North St car park and also West St car park, both of which are easy to access from museum. Clean and tidy, fully accessible, roomy loo. Easy to find not far from entrance."
dorney court kitchen garden dorney,negative,Parking 15 feet from entrance and 50 feet from exit approx. No public transport. Disabled loo available and accessible but I have never had cause to use them so cannot vomment further.
dorney court kitchen garden dorney,positive,Fairly accessible and clean
dornoch castle hotel dornoch,negative,"There is parking in the street, fairly close to the hotel entrance. There is a car park at the back, which was full and was very very muddy One at the front door, near the bar. Quite far away from restaurant "
double gate farm bed breakfast wells,positive,"Set on the edge of the Somerset Levels, vehicle access is probably a necessity, although excellent hand cycling countryside, so could be a option too. Yes, accessible public facilities for visitors to coffee shop. There is not a Changing Places toilet, although all the Riverside Rooms accommodation  has large roll in showers and toilet facilities, catering for up-to five people staying Disabled parking available adjacent to the accessible rooms and with space to load and unload right outside the door."
doubletree by hilton aberdeen city centre aberdeen,negative,limited disabled parking  - only access one side of the car in some places - despite a large carpark
doubletree by hilton aberdeen city centre aberdeen,positive,"Disabled parking spaces at front of the hotel. Not sure about public transport so can't comment Parking was good. Plenty of spaces, right in front of hotel. There was a wet room in our room and it was pretty good. Had to move furniture to get wheelchair into it. There was only a small shower chair so would not be suitable for anyone was is unable to sit up and balance themselves. "
doubletree by hilton amsterdam centraal station amsterdam,positive,"Can't comment on the parking - we arrived by train. The hotel is a very short wheel/walk from Centraal Station. Care needed when crossing tram lines and cycle paths, which are used by mopeds and scooters as well as bicycles. Our en-suite bathroom had a wide door, a wheelchair accessible washbasin, a loo with fold-down grab rails either side (side transfer from one side would be possible) and a wet-room shower with grab rail and fold-down seat and controls at an appropriate level. An alarm cord extended right round the room (apart from the doorway) about  18"" above floor level, so anyone who fell would be able to reach it, wherever they ended up. In addition, there was a bathtub which the accompanist enjoyed using, and that had a single grab rail."
doubletree by hilton dunblane hydro dunblane,negative,"Disabled parking is at the back of the hotel.  Oddly there are only three disabled bays and the hotel has five accessible rooms.  On occasion, my wife had to abandon me at the door and park were she could."
doubletree by hilton dunblane hydro dunblane,positive,Disabled parking at the rear was great and yards from the disabled entrance. The hotel sits on top of a hill though so walking/pushing to it from public transport could be troublesome!! Perfect for me. Integrated within the general male/female toilets so definitely not an afterthought. (Well done!). I did think that the toilet was positioned a bit close to the sink which I feel would be awkward for anyone transferring from a wheelchair
doubletree by hilton edinburgh city centre edinburgh,negative,"The approach to the hotel on foot from Lothian Road, as a powerchair user, required me to cross on to the raised pavement outside of the hotel. I approached on the castle side of the street as the other side had inaccessible kerbs.   There is a high kerb between the hotel pavement and the road surface with two steps in places so you have to cross using the traffic islands in front of the hotel. Unfortunately, some of the islands are not level access with a 10 cm drop or thereabouts. Just enough to make negotiating my powerchair across a little trickier.  Once I had got up on to the raised pavement outside the hotel it was  level and easy to wheel across.    The hotel entrance is set in a glass frontage and it has wide automated doors. It was well signed and easy for me to find although my visually impaired companion struggled a bit to tell the difference between the doors and the glass frontage.  There is limited on-street parking around the hotel. Parking in a nearby car park is available as well as discounts on the charges. For me arrival was straightforward as a taxi can take you to the main entrance. Beware the odd pavements as it’s up two steps in places and is not all that obvious; certainly not to me as a visually impaired person.  I understand there are buses running along nearby Lothian Road (approximately 100 metres) that go to all parts of the city.  If coming by car there are car parks nearby and the hotel has discount arrangements.   The railway stations at Haymarket and Waverley are only a ten-minute taxi journey. I think there was yellow lines on the dipped kerb but but I might be wrong "
doubletree by hilton edinburgh city centre edinburgh,positive,"‘This was clean with plenty of space, all on the level off the lobby.   A member of staff was on hand and opened the door without being asked. Very clean  Spacious clean and well equipped toilet  Clean bright spacious. Grab rails at that and sink Easy access soap dispenser and hand towels..Red pull cord. All you need and spacious.  Accessible Toilets (Public Areas)  An accessible toilet is located toward the far side of the reception and adjacent to the lift. The door clearance for the accessible toilet is 86 cm.  There were other accessible toilets in the dining room area as well. There were accessible toilets off the dining area and off the reception. These were bright, light and spacious. I arrived into Edinburgh by train and this hotel is a short walk straight down the street from Haymarket.  There is an accessible loo off reception I find it difficult to open doors but staff always seem to be on hand to help without being asked.   There is space for a carer and it was clean.   "
doubletree by hilton edinburgh queensferry crossing north queensferry,positive,Plenty of parking thankfully well placed in a hilly carpark.
doubletree by hilton glasgow central glasgow,negative,This time I was dropped off by taxi at the front door. Buses from the north and west of the city travel along Renfrew Street which is to the side of the hotel. There is an NCP car park close by. We had specialised transport but there is no drop-off or pick-up parking outside
doubletree by hilton glasgow central glasgow,positive,There is an underground carpark if you go round the back of the hotel that has disabled parking in it. It costs £6 per night and there are lifts that take you straight into the hotel. The Bathroom in the room suited our needs really well There were 2 shower heads - a fixed one for those that can stand under it and a handheld one (which lacked a bit of pressure) for those using the shower chair.
doubletree by hilton hotel coventry coventry,negative,"Did not use the foyer/reception toilets.  In the room, loo was far too close to the sink (actually right arm against the top of the basin)  Ill thought out design iff any."
doubletree by hilton hotel coventry coventry,positive,"We arrived by Taxi, no car.  Staff did not offer any info on local busses, although I spotted a bus stop a short distance from the hotel. The venue is somewhat isolated if you do not have a car.  So cannot answer re disabled parking. There is an adequate sized car park , and drop off point near the main entrance of the hotel"
doubletree by hilton hotel london westminster london,negative,No assigned disabled parking space outside the hotel but possible to arrange and reserve by an appointment. Rooms available with bathrooms adjusted to disabled peoples needs but very small !!!
doubletree by hilton hotel newcastle international airport newcastle upon tyne,positive,Roll in shower with grab rails etc.
doubletree by hilton sheffield park sheffield,positive,"We arrived by car and parked in one of the disabled parking bays in the hotel’s car park. Parking was complimentary. Disabled bays were located near the hotel’s reception entrance. Our hotel bathroom was huge and provided lots of space for my wheelchair. I didn't have any problems turning and could easily do full turns without knocking into anything.   The toilet was positioned in the corner with space for left-hand transfers. There was grab bars on each side of the toilet as well as the wash basin beside the toilet.  The roll-in shower was very good with a good sizes shower seat, grab bars and shower controls within reaching distance.  The main sink was large with lots of counter surface space. I was able to roll underneath the sink without banging my knees. The mixer tap was positioned at the side of the sink for easier reach rather than the back. "
doubletree by hilton stoke on trent stoke on trent,negative,"The hotel lies in a nicely built up small business area, lots of grassy areas, leading to hotel itself, with lots of parking, and 4 disabled bays, which are right next to main hotel entrance. (4*).  The disabled toilet was close enough to reception area, easy to arrive at, but then found it smallish, and untidy. Grab rails are there for you."
doune castle doune,negative,"Doune is a small village north of Stirling and getting there may be a bit challenging by public transport but not impossible. The Castle sits along a narrow lane at the edge of the village. A lot of work has been done recently to create a small car park . There is one marked accessible parking bay but be warned that it is not wide so not possible to wheel easily, if at all, alongside your vehicle. I had great difficulty in parking my WAV (wheelchair accessible vehicle) but a friendly steward came along and said it would be fine to park further along in one of the two coach spaces so problem solved."
doune castle doune,positive,A good and spacious accessible toilet is to be found in the small cottage directly opposite to the Castle.
doune ponds doune,negative,No loos at all anywhere near. :(
doune ponds doune,positive,"Very small carpark with only one official disabled spot. Bit of a slope and a big gate to enter the Ponds, so a lone wheelchair user would need assistance.  Car park was close by with blue badge spaces. It was full when we arrived but it’s quiet enough to park on roadside. There must be busses to Doune from Stirling."
dove stone reservoir greenfield,positive,You'll need a car to get here. The car park has plenty of spaces and many disabled spaces. The whole car park is on a slope and there are a couple of drainage channels to be negotiated.  Radar key operation. 
dovecot edinburgh,positive,"The only reason this review is not five stars is simply because of the small, slightly sloping street that Dovecot is tucked away on. There are plenty of buses running along the main road off of this quiet street, and there are parking spaces available on nearby Chamber Street however. Nice large accessible toilet on the viewing balcony."
dover castle dover,negative,The disabled toilets in the tunnel area were good. The one by the medieval tower was not so good due to the main door being stiff to open.
dover castle dover,positive,The car park is right at the top.  The site has a visitor bus as it is big and the ramp was ready in 2 seconds and no fuss  The ticket office at the main entrance will give concessions for disabled and carer and there is a flat disabled car park near the top of the castle site.    
dover museum and bronze age boat gallery dover,positive,Dover has a number of designated blue badge parking areas on the roads
dover transport museum whitfield,negative,There is no toilet on site that is suitable for adult chair users who need transfer space to the side. The toilet has support rails. 
dover transport museum whitfield,positive,"We went by car. Parking was near the entrance on grass.  You can drop of in front on a hard, flat surface."
downpatrick county down railway downpatrick,positive,"Huge car park with many spaces including disabled parking. Museum is in the centre of town and is well served by the local buses. There's just the one unisex toilet on the on a little station just a few dozen metres away from the museum building itself. It's large, with a wide, lightweight door; there's a small grab rail next to the toilet; there are easy-turn taps at the basin."
dr brews coffee blues windermere,positive,"There is on-street parking outside the cafe but this is Bowness so very busy especially in the tourist season.  There is a public car park about 20 metres away. I thought the loo was excellent although I am not a powerchair user.  there is good space as can be seen in the pictures and the toilets are fresh and clean.  It's worth visiting just for the music that is piped in.  There is also a baby changing table available.  For a new coffee shop, it was great to see this much thought put into the accessibility of the toilet.  Kudos."
dr neils garden edinburgh,negative,"Got the bus to Duddingston Mills from London road, Lothian Buses 4, 44. Then about a 15 minutes walk to Doctor Neil's - which is semi difficult to find if you don't really know where you are going. It's not really signposted well."
dr neils garden edinburgh,positive,"An accessible loo - excellent, wide and plenty of space.  There is parking nearby in the Holyrood Park car park, and also at Duddingston Kirk. There was no nearby public transport."
dragonfly cocktail bar edinburgh,negative,There is one available on the ground level. It is very old school. Very low toilet. Very few grab rails in useful places.
draughts board game cafe london,negative,"I gave it 1.5 points for being large enough to theoretically get a wheelchair into. Theoretically, because I couldn't actually get my wheelchair into the loo because of the stack of large containers making the narrow passage totally impassable for wheelchairs.  Also no support handles, frame, or emergency pull cord. "
draycote water kites hardwick,negative,Easy to get into and plenty of space and handles. I give a 3 because the visitors center has the only toilets i have found. It would be a bonus to have some half way around the 5.1 miles.
draycote water kites hardwick,positive,"Plenty of parking. A little uphill to get to the visitors center, but manageble. Again for most this place may be better with some."
drayton manor theme park tamworth,negative,"the loos are terrible, only two on the whole site were big enough to turn around in, and also to transfer,  the others were either dirty, no emergency cord, loo roll half way up the wall, flush on wrong side, narrow door way, slippery floor, dripping taps, air dryers great for drying  hair not good for hands,  emergency pull in corners not accessible, the list goes on, "
drayton manor theme park tamworth,positive,"If you are early enough there are many disabled places for parking , not the biggest spaces but not bad, public transport is out of my remit I am afraid "
dreams coffee lounge northampton,negative,on street parking
drift north berwick,positive,"Plenty of parking space immediately in front of the cafe.  unfortunately we arrived on a rather wet morning.  The car park was a mass of puddles joined by an uneven surface.  We reversed directly up to the ramp at the entrance to unload.   The wheelchair accessible toilet is well decorated, clean and functional."
droitwich spa droitwich,negative,"Bit complicated trying to find the car park on sat NAV, as not sure if this was public car park, or supermarket car park, but pleased to see its free parking for 3 hours for disabled. However, it’s quite a slope you have to get down for shopping centre, then that hard push up when you return. We found them, but could not get in to use them. It looked small from outside anyway, so quess it’s just a basic toilet."
dronfield sports centre dronfield,positive,"The venue has 7 disabled bays across 2 x car parks. These are larger bays which will aid with transfers and unloading of equipment. There is a bus stop directly outside the leisure centre at the bottom of the ramped access into the building.  The toilets and shower facilities were easy to locate and very accessible due to level access. The toilet, shower and changing facilities were combined in one cubical which makes self-care and dressing easier if having used the swimming facilities. The shower had a drop down seat directly under the shower and one adjacent to it. There is a grab rail and emergency cord in the shower. The shower has level access and a riser rail bar to adjust the height of the shower. The toilet has a drop down rail on the left and a vertical, static grab rail. To the right their is a horizontal grab rail. The toilet is equipped with an emergency cord and a lumbar padded back rest and the toilet paper is within easy reach. The sink has a vertical hand rail on either side and has no pedestal and is not boxed in. This helps with manoeuvring around and positioning at the sink . There is a lever tap with thermostatic control. "
drumbrae leisure centre edinburgh,negative,"These are dotted about  and are good. The centre itself is a bit off the beaten track, so a walk if arriving by foot.  However there is a large car park with plenty of disabled bays available. There are three of these - one each in the gym/pool disabled changing rooms, and one outside behind reception.  All are easy to access."
drumbrae leisure centre edinburgh,positive,"Lots of accessible bays immediately in front of the centre. Around 6 in total, with some additional parent and child spaces. The accessible changing/toilet in the dry area was fantastic, with a ceiling hoist etc. The l Changing area in the swim area had everything I would need, but didn’t have a hoist and was smaller than the dry side changing space. Good sized disabled toilet. With changing bed and tracking hoist."
drumlanrig castle thornhill,negative,"We walked here, but there is a long drive up to the castle up a grand driveway - I think there's accessible parking spaces."
drygate brewing company glasgow,negative,They do have car park with disabled spaces but to enter venue is down hill from car park so assistance is possibly required.
drygate brewing company glasgow,positive,"Grab rails, alarm, lots of room to manoeuvre chair. Bright, clean, motion sensitive light. On site and close to entrance"
dubai exhibition centre dubai,positive,"I believe that a Metro train went there to the site which is quite a few kilometres from Dubai central,  if you didn't have your own transport and there are always plenty of taxis There are huge car park surrounding with free buses to the venue. Dubai is quite geared up to disabilities and the toilets were fine but I don't think there was a changing room toilet. The loo I visited was clean and there was  sufficient space with  grab rails. Paper toilets and soap dispensers provided "
dublin bus dublin,negative,The Termini is on O'Connel Street in central Dublin. I could find no disabled parking. I chose to use the Luas (tram) into town
dublin zoo dublin,positive,"We took a taxi as the zoo is in the middle of a large park. There is a car park right next to the zoo for people who are driving but unfortunately out of staggering range of the entrance. It alleges to be a 15 minute walk from Heuston station but it seemed further than that. Accessible toilets, normal style, are dotted throughout the zoo at the same points as the regular loos. You do need to ask for the code to access them when you go in as they are locked to keep others out - great idea as long as you have the code! I did find the doors very heavy and required help to get in and out of the toilets."
duchess theatre london,negative,"We used public transport to get there.  There is a bus stop fairly nearby which goes to the place where we were staying. When we left, the staff told us which direction to go and which bus to catch. London buses, as usual, were fully accessible. I do not know of any tube stations nearby, and I would not advocate driving there."
duchess theatre london,positive,"It was easy to find. It was fairly long, but also quite thin so impossible to turn around in."
duck bay hotel restaurant alexandria,positive,"There are four blue badge spaces. These cannot be accessed from the main car park, so if coming from the South you should drive past the entrance to the main car park to the next opening on the right.There are  a few steps up from the main car park, although a wheelchair user could take the slightly longer way round from it by going back out on to the pavement. There is more parking across the road which is also available to the general public, so can get very busy. The toilet is on the same level as the entrance. The door is in a small rectangular area which also has the entrances to the ladies and gents. The toilet has grab rails on both sides and the red cord goes to the floor, though it was a bit tucked away. The room is rather tight for a wheelchair user and assistant - in fact as I moved between the back of the chair and the front to assist my relative it was impossible to avoid setting off the hand drier all the time. Parking is available by the hotel with some accessible spaces. There is a larger car park across the road specifically for Duck Bay customers. "
duff house banff,negative,I travelled via car and the first thing that I noticed was that the signs to the car park are not very clear. There is a disabled car parking space (Only one) right beside the house but I never noticed. Could be much clearer.
duffus castle elgin,positive,The Castle sits amidst the rural farmland north of Elgin. The only practical means of getting here is realistically using your own transport. A small car park sits at the foot of the Castle mound and is well surfaced. There are no designated accessible parking bays but it is not that busy so these aren't really necessary. 
dulwich park london,negative,"The nearest train stations are Sydenham Hill (1.2 miles away, NO step-free access), North Dulwich (0.5 miles away, NO step-free access) and Herne Hill (1 mile away, fully step-free).   Bus routes P4, P13, 176, 185, 197 will drop you off somewhere near the park, not always close enough for convenience.  The park has numerous wheelchair-badged parking spaces near the entrance gates. But - very thoughtlessly - the wide gates permitting vehicular access into the park are kept locked. So the parking spaces are academic and tokenistic."
dulwich picture gallery london,positive,"There is parking available on the adjoining streets but also space on the gallery's land for disabled vehicles. The disabled toilet is not really large enough for carer and wheelchair. it was not as easy as in some to assist  with the transfer, but it is clean and modern."
dumbarton football stadium dumbarton,negative,"Accessible toilet which was easy to find. Had fold-down rail to left of toilet (when on toilet) and fixed rail on wall on right. Flush for the toilet seemed fairly high up if trying to reach it from sitting in a wheelchair.   Toilet clean and functional, but whole area just made of concrete blocks so wasn't the most attractive. A mirror would also be good to have. "
dumbarton football stadium dumbarton,positive,"CAR PARKING Dedicated Car park in Stadium grounds.  No charge for Blue Badge.  Buses drop supporter off beside turnstiles DISPERSAL Very efficient.  Coaches can pick up supporters directly  outside the exits  LEAVING THE CARPARK There can be a hold-up on Castle Road because of cars attempting to turn right into Glasgow Road. Suggestion…take the first left onto Leven Street, and left again where Leven Street meets Glasgow Road (going westwards away from Glasgow).   At the next roundabout circle round and return eastwards on Glasgow Road. TOILETS and REFRESHMENTS Good access Car parking in the grounds includes about 20 marked disabled bays. Attendants were at the entrance and they pointed us in the right direction.  We arrived early and got in without difficulty, but the car park did fill up, and others parked in surrounding streets (free parking).  The nearest train station is Dumbarton East, however this station is not accessible if you use a wheelchair/have mobility problems as can only be accessed via a steep flight of stairs.  The nearest accessible train station is Dumbarton central. "
dumfries and galloway royal infirmary dumfries,positive,"34 dedicated disabled parking spaces close to entrance,  wheelchairs available for both children and adults with mobility difficulties just inside ED entrance Completely flat access 3 drop off points at ED entrance Public transport bus 111 from town to hospital's main entrance, unsure if bus is fully accessible 2 accessible loos in reception area, both signposted, one at either end of reception, one being close to entrance Fully wheelchair accessible, plenty of turning room Plenty of grabrails in situ , in appropriate areas Higher height toilet Pull cord for assistance ( not tied up!) Various height clothing hooks Public bus stop a short walking distance from the main entrance, with plenty of adjacent seating to rest Large carpark with plenty of accessible parking spaces , but a bit of a walk for those with mobility restrictions  Car park has 80 electric charging points, but did not notice if any of these were situated in the accessible parking areas Drop off points nearer the main entrance for those with restricted mobility  Plenty of accessible loos on the ground floor and outpatients department, well signposted Information board at entrance advises where accessible loos are located throughout the building, although the board fails to mention that a Changing Places Toilet is available on the ground floor in the main atrium. Loos are roomy & clean , with plenty of grab rails, red cords  hanging to the floor"
dumfries house cumnock,positive,we parked right outside the door avoiding the steps
dumfries ice bowl dumfries,positive,4 spaces next to the front door
dumplings legend london,negative,"Several bus routes will drop you off reasonably nearby in Shaftesbury Avenue. The nearest step-free station is Green Park, which is a short bus-ride away. There is an 'accessible' toilet. Access to it was blocked by a huge stack of chairs which it took two men quite a while to shift out of the way. The toilet is too small, there is no room to park your wheelchair for a sideways transfer to the toilet (if you need this, stay away), there is no emergency cord. So it's a kind of half-hearted stab at the idea of an accessible toilet. Could be better."
dunalastair hotel suites pitlochry,positive,"Lots of parking in the square outside, however no wheelchair marked bays.  Also they had marked out the bays by using slightly raised square cobbles.  They were just the right height to catch a toe or crutch.  I had to concentrate on where they were so as not to fall as the blend well with the rest of the road."
dunbar camping and caravanning club site dunbar,negative,"You really need to drive to get here, but the signage is good leading to the campsite and there is a nicely laid out carpark beside the reception. "
dunbar camping and caravanning club site dunbar,positive,Very clean and spacious. Well signposted and and accessed via a smooth pavement.
dunbar community bakery dunbar,positive,"There is parking all the way along the High Street in Dunbar, the bus stops are within 1 min of the Bakery. The Railway Station 5 mins. Good bus links right along the Dunbar high street and lots of parking in the vicinity. Good pedestrian crossings on approach to the bakery too."
dunblane museum dunblane,positive,Disabled parking bay on street and in nearby surface car park at Cathedral. Very large accessible toilet on ground floor.........very spacious for maneuvering wheelchair and space for carer too.
dundee carers centre dundee,positive,"There are two easy-to-find accessible toilets. Both have a turning circle, chairs, low sinks, and grab rails. They are always clean and tidy and there is space for a carer. There are red emergency cords that hang to the floor inbetween the toilet and the chair and have Euans guide signs on them"
dundee contemporary arts dundee,negative,"Not quite right - toilet pan central in reasonably wide room, but not enough room on either side for easy transfers! No radar key lock and also doubles as baby changing which can mean it's engaged for long periods of time. The only reason I marked this down is because I am a hoist transfer so I can only use a changing place toilet. I didn't notice a sign for a disabled toilet on the level we were on, but I'm not really used to looking for them because I know it won't be suitable for me. "
dundee contemporary arts dundee,positive,"There is disabled parking behind the DCA, there is a lift that takes you up to the bar and cinema floor which is smallish but no smaller than a lift you might find in a hotel or sports place. At the moment you are only meant to have the person in the lift so didn’t feel that cramped for me. Big car park to rear of the centre, close to the train station and city centre. "
dundee museum of transport dundee,negative,There was three bays but appeared to have non blue badge vehicles when we visited Did not see one but feel that there would be
dundee railway station dundee,negative,"There is a parking space at the train station, although there used to be one (see picture below). When the temporary train station first opened there was one parking space right at the top, after you pass the taxi rank.   This was however taken away maybe last year to make the pathway bigger for pedestrians. Now I'm all for safety, but I feel they could of done this without taking away the only available disabled parking space. There isn't any non-disabled parking spaces either, but I feel there is more of a need for disabled parking spaces.   My advice would be to take away a small part of the taxi rank and create a disabled parking space here. I parked in taxi rank once just for 20 minutes whilst I booked tickets for another trip and got shouted at by a taxi driver who said he reported me. Think he was telling fibs though because I didn't receive anything from anyone saying I did wrong.   The reason I've given 1 star is because there are two council car parks 5 minute walk away, depending on traffic lights. Luckily it was sunny this time I visited but we live in Scotland, it's not sunny for long. On a miserable wet day it wouldn't be good at all.   Taxi rank right outside, but hardly any dipped kerbs to get on to pavement. Not many taxis there late at night so have to walk a fair distance to get to another in the main city centre. Also bus stops nearby as right in city centre.  Taxi rank outside station, bus stop a bit far from entrance (city centre). No close proximity parking. Taxi rank immediately outside served by several accessible taxis."
dundee railway station dundee,positive,"I got the train into the station then left on foot to travel around Dundee. Great service from Glasgow Queen Street. I didn't see any accessible bays outside the station, but there is a taxi rank immediately outside the door.  Great accessible loo, which had everything I needed and is quite spacious. Don't know Dundee particularly well, but there was a taxi rank immediately outside the station which was great.  Two disabled toilets one has a radar lock and both fit a wheelchair in easily."
dundee rep theatre dundee,positive,Spacious and clean
dundee science centre dundee,positive,"Transport & Parking There is a council car park right outside of Dundee Science Centre which is free for blue badge holders but other visitors  have to do pay and display, I could see about 3 or 4 disabled parking spaces. Across the road there is also Greenmarket car park which is also a council car park but is indoors and I think there are lots of parking spaces.  Dundee Science Centre is located in the city centre of Dundee so there is lots of public transport nearby. The train station is a 5 minute walk away, maybe not even that long, and there is a taxi rank here. The bus station is about a 10 minute walk away and there are also bus stops nearby which go all over the Dundee and Angus area. There is an accessible toilet however, I do not feel it is very big and I think if someone needs assistance from someone else you could struggle. There is also not an emergency red cord in this accessible toilet but I reported this to staff and they are going to look into it.  Luckily there is an amazing Changing Places toilet been installed during the new refurbishments. I was amazed at the size of this room and I think because it has high ceilings as well it makes it feel so much bigger. There is a H shaped ceiling tracking hoist that covers the whole room and there is a bed folded up against one of the walls. You can see from the photo below that there is plenty of space to transfer to the toilet even if you don’t need to use the hoist. The bins were beside the toilet but we said how this can cause problem for people transfer and they moved the bins and said they will put tape on the floor so staff and cleaners know where they need to be placed. There are grab rails at each side of the toilet and the sink is height adjustable. This Changing Place toilet can be accessed by a RADAR key and if you don’t have one you can get it from the front desk. There are designated parking spaces close to the building, which has a level entrance.  Adapted toilets are available to visitors which it wide enough for most wheelchairs or mobility scooter. Only 2. Free In the multi storey nearby with blue badge "
dunelm falkirk,positive,"Parking for the retail park is good,and some near each shop"
dunelm kirkcaldy,positive,The Toilets are very easy too use  There is Emergency pull cord that goes all the way to the floor so it would be easy to use in case of emergency  The toilet is big and wide enough to fit a wheelchair in with no stress at all in my option   
dunelm loanhead,positive,"With a car, there is substantial parking and disabled spaces, each car park services each area but it is not sectioned unless you want to visit the Sainsbury’s and it’s petrol and LPG outlet at the southern end. Buses to city and out of town services are plentiful, there are 3 bus stops that service each area of the retail park, the park and ride is 50 m from the Straiton bus stop next to the pedestrian crossing on the main A701. There are no parking charges. "
dunelm newport,positive,large tarmac car park with several good sized parking bays for blue badge holders nearest to the door Good sized accessible toilet with grab rails and enough room for a wheelchair to turn Sign posted on the directory outside and inside the lift (toilet is on 1st floor) Clean and tidy 
dunelm saint helens,negative,Not enough really
dunelm truro,negative,They have refurbished the toilets but failed to include a Changing Places toilet. Massive fail.
dunelm truro,positive,Adequate Blue Badge parking on a flat surface. 
dunfermline abbey and palace dunfermline,positive,"We couldn’t fault the parking as we were able to park alongside the Abbey Church and adjacent to the Abbey and Palace using our Blue Badge. There were also some on street parking bays. It’s not too far to walk from there to see the Carnegie Birthplace Museum as well as the new Carnigie Libarary and Galleries. There are no toilets on the site but the adjacent, 100m, new library and museum building had excellent toilets including a Changing Places Toilet."
dunfermline business centre dunfermline,positive,disabled bays near the entrance well signposted  lowered kerbs easy to get in out of clean tidy did report a crack in the pan emergency chord easy to get to turn handle on toilet door could be an issue
dunfermline carnegie library galleries dunfermline,negative,"Toilets were very clean. No space to turn a wheelchair or move about in the loo. They have done the bare minimum to make them accessible. And they certainly aren't accessible to all. There is a changing spaces toilet area. I was told a radar key is required. We urgently needed to change my daughters nappy when we first arrived and I really struggled in the small space. My daughter can weight bare but if she couldn't the toilets would have been even more of a nightmare! Actually really disappointed in the toilets. I've seen better disabled toilets in wee old cafe's and this building has won awards for it's good design. Don't get me wrong, the tiling is gorgeous but it's a bit of form over function. "
dunfermline carnegie library galleries dunfermline,positive,Can’t fault the parking as we had the options of several accessible parking bays and it was fairly easy to find a space that work with my wheelchair accessible vehicle and rear ramp. Spaces to the font and rear of the building. Friends walked from the town centre and it was easy to find and get to. Lots of buses passing nearby as well. Simple great ... loved the idea that each of the access or loos was a slightly different layout to accommodate different requirements but the icing on the cake has to be the Changing Places Toilet - much needed and so welcome to see. Usual city parking but ample on street parking close by.  Accessible loos on every floor. Clean and fully functional. Disabled parking directly outside. The road is cobbled. Typical old town style. You have to parallel park so if you require a chair to come out the back of the vehicle then this could be problematic. 
dunluce castle bushmills,negative,"We came via tour bus and was dropped off at the entrance. There is limited blue badge bay parking available. Unaware of any public transport options.  Available at the visitor centre at the beginning. Down a short winding path which has enough space for my wide power chair. Doors were light, handrails on both sides of bathroom and enough room to get a chair in."
dunmore trail faskally,negative,Basic but was perfectly adequate.
dunnet bay distillery dunnet,negative,Decent sized loo but if they removed large wicker display baskets it would be 4*. Look pretty but make it too tight for wheelchair.  (Nothing gets 5* without a Changing Place!)
dunnet bay distillery dunnet,positive,"Sizeable carpark but gravel so might be difficult for some. Very sporadic public transport so must have car. There is path from nearby DunnetBay caravan park, though slightly uphill to get there!"
dunollie hotel isle of skye,negative,We had to park on the pavement outside the hotel until I got out & into my wheelchair.
dunorlan park royal tunbridge wells,negative,On a sunny Sunday afternoon the car park we used was full. There is a hard surface car park for around 45 cars but only a few reserved blue badge spaces with no safety markings to exit the vehicle. There is another car park entrance with a few spaces on the opposite side to the park (cafe side).
dunorlan park royal tunbridge wells,positive,"I didn't use the toilet in the cafe because you had to get past the queue through the single door, navigate between fairly close tables to the back of the room. It also looked like a tight turn and seemed to double up as the ladies toilet. Just before the cafe there is a toilet block with a good clean toilet, full support rails but no wash basin rails. This one uses the RADAR key.  See photos. "
dunsley hall country house hotel whitby,negative,If you are only visiting the restaurant the unisex disabled loo is within the ladies powder room. It is excellent for ambulant wheelchair users or manual wheelchair users. Unfortunately the entrance is too narrow for power chair users.
dunsley hall country house hotel whitby,positive,If your lucky there is a disabled car parking space adjacent to the start of the ramp to the entrance. Otherwise stop and unload the car at the ramp and park in the main carpark. There is no public transport except taxis from Whitby centre.
duquesa playa santa eularia des riu,negative,Plenty of disabled parking places and wheelchair accessible taxis. Did not use buses so cannot comment. Passenger ferry to other resorts is not fully accessible.
duquesa playa santa eularia des riu,positive,Toilet was clean just enough room to turn in the chair with good solid grab rails. Could easily slide under sink to it had good access.
durham cathedral durham,negative,"If you drive to the cathedral, you have to enter the Charging Zone. This is £2 per day and must be paid by 6pm. You can apply for exemption if you are a blue badge holder but we didn't know that in advance.  We parked at Prince Bishop car park. Accessible parking is on level 1 and there are lifts to the street level (S). The lifts weren't huge and my trike is bigger than a normal chair so it was pretty tight. The route up through town was mostly easy, except for the last stretch which was steep and cobbled.  There are buses that go up too but we didn't try that. Didn't use coz it was being used by a child so struggled in to ladies which was fine. "
durham cathedral durham,positive,"It was a bit of a trek to get to the toilets and it wasn't big enough for my trike. Fortunately, I can manage a few steps so left my trike outside. Grab rails and layout were fine. If I'd used my normal chair it would have been easy."
durham cathedral the banks,negative,"Twice an hour bus in the week until 6pm. No disabled parking on palace Green .Accessible parking in the College limited and well hidden The original disabled loo is not adequate ,the new one is. Getting to the cathedral for a wheelchair user could be tricky, there are narrow paths and a cobbled street. There is a longer route to the cathedral which is slightly easier and is via the cloisters. There is disabled parking available on Palace Green and there is also a shuttle bus that has wheelchair access (although this was tested on the day)."
durham cathedral the banks,positive,"Spacious, has all of the correct hand rails etc. However slightly dated.   It's quite a way to go to (there are several sets of automatic doors that you need to go through to access the toilet)."
durham durham,negative,"Open air parking limited for wheelchair users. 2 disabled spaces in the car park we parked in. The majority of parking in Durham is in multi stories with restricted hight which is lower than I've usually experienced. If you use a WAV like a Ford torneo, a mid size WAV, you will have to find a space in an open air car park. Blue badge holders pay for parking with extra hours charged at a lower rate after 2 hours. All parking free after 2pm. 1 radar key toilet by the Cathedral. Large enough but poorly lit and with minimal aids and not very clean."
durham grange caravan club site durham,positive,"I don't think you could get any closer to the A1(M) without actually being on it. You come off at J62 and the site is right there. It was so easy, I didn't even bother with SatNav.  Good accessible toilet and shower. Loads of grab rails. Warm, clean, lovely! It is RADAR locked, so bring your key."
dvsa theory test centre dumbarton,negative,"Virtually no parking immediately outside as it is on the high street. Some street parking is available, but I didn't see any disabled parking on the street. There are a few public car parks nearby with excellent disabled spaces.  It was clean and tidy, with enough space for me to manoeuvre very comfortably. However, I have a fairly compact manual chair, so I think someone in a larger or powerchair might find it a bit tight. The door is very light, the doorway large, and all usual grab rails were present, as was a red cord dangling freely to the floor. "
dyffryn gardens cardiff,positive,Disabled spaces right outstrip door but not many. No public transport Excellent but no Changing places
dynamic earth edinburgh,negative,Not sure about parking as we used Lothian buses to the canongate then walked round. There is parking underground though. 
eagle lifter horley,positive,Changing places toilets available airside in arrivals. To access these on an outbound journey please ask staff for assistance
earl of camden london,negative,Camden is on a number of accessible bus routes and London Overground. The Underground station is not step free.
earlston high school earlston,negative,The loos had a lot of space and there was at least one on every floor. I was impressed by the amount of disabled loos as there was one in almost every corridor and subject department.
earlston high school earlston,positive,There was a good amount of disabled spaces next to the school with a ramp the the front door
earnley butterfly farm earnley,negative,"3 disabled parking bays, but the car park was loose gravel (although not as deep as in other areas) I gave them one star for actually having a disabled toilet, however I didn't really fancy going in it as it was covered in used toilet roll and paper towels."
east avenue bakehouse liverpool,negative,"We walked here so it's difficult to say - Bold Street was incredibly busy so parking didn't look easy, but there was on-street parking directly in front of the bakehosue. Unfortunately I don't know the area too well to offer alternatives, but given it's in the city centre I'd imagine there is more parking nearby. It is close to a main road with bus stops, and we managed to get a taxi from there. Didn't use this but there is an accessible toilet on the ground floor (same level as bakehouse), and the others are in the basement down a narrow set of stairs. There was quite a lot of clutter outside the door of the toilet (mainly high chairs), and these would likely need to be moved out of the way first. This is where East Avenue Bakehouse lose most their stars in this review unfortunately! "
east cottage cupar,positive,We parked just in the driveway of East Cottage. It's very tight and you need to reverse into the parking space but it is possible. We have a Passat estate and managed.
east end park dunfermline,positive,Parking is right outside the disabled gate at the same level nice and wide Again easy to get in and out rooms with all necessary equipment
east kilbride district dementia carers group east kilbride,positive,I parked right outside it and the bust stop is a 2 minute walk It had grab rails and was right beside living room everyone was in
east lancashire railway manchester,positive,There is a car park right next to the station within 20 metres Very clean
east links family park dunbar,positive,"They worked well for us. Spacious parking without bays, so we were able to choose a big area where we could get in and out with ease. We didn't see any designated disabled parking, but also, we didn't look for it, so it probably is there. The accessible loo was easy to find, very spacious and well-facilitated and clean. Need to go by car but there is plenty of parking Great toilet but no red cord We travelled by car and there are definitely enough disabled parking spaces which are nearer the park entrance for easier access. The nearest bus stop is a small distance away but there will be a small walk from the bus stop to the park. There was many accessible toilets although some are quite small. They are in good condition and kept fairly clean."
east of arcadia leeds,positive,"This venue does not have an allocated car park, but there is limited parking nearby. There is a bus stop approx 50m from the entrance, giving easy access into Leeds city centre. The toilets are well-signposted. The disabled loo is of a good size, with plenty of room to manoeuvre a wheelchair. They are clean and clutter-free and have grab rails in-situ."
east princes street gardens edinburgh,positive,"The Gardens, at the East end, are really handy for public transport with the Tram stopping nearby, bus stops right outside the gates and Waverley Station a short distance away. The Galleries have an accessible loo. There are others not too far away at St. Andrew Square, Waverley Station and at the Waverley Shopping Centre."
east riding leisure haltemprice anlaby,positive,"There are disabled parking bays available close to the Centre allowing easy access, there is also a bus stop outside of the Leisure Centre. The toilet had a lot of space and some of the changing areas were equipped with hoists to support individuals. The car park is close to the entrance, with 6 disabled parking bays. In addition there is a disabled entrance that allows easy access via a call button.  Plenty of disabled toilets. "
eastbourne eastbourne,positive,"Eastbourne railway station is step free and in the middle of the town centre and about half a mile from the sea front. There are lots of local accessible buses that serve the area. Adjacent to the train station is a taxi rank. There were accessible and a Changing Places toilet in The Beacon shopping centre and also on the sea front, near the Bandstand and Pier.  "
eastbourne pier eastbourne,positive,"The Pier is about half a mile from Eastbourne railway station. There are local buses that stop outside. I didn't see any signs for toilets on the pier, but there may have been some in the amusement areas or in the cafes/ pub, which I didn't go into.   I did find an accessible toilet plus non accessible toilets near the entrance to the pier. This involved turning right on exiting the pier, following the slope until it met the path that goes under the pier. Then going towards this path to  the pier the accessible toilet is on the right hand side before their pier, see photos. The accessible toilet is not easy to find when you are walking towards the pier as the yellow sign, see photo, is on the back of the cubicle. There was also another sign saying radar key could be obtained from the attendant in the ladies. However when I went into the ladies, there were pay gates and I didn't see an attendant and when I called out I got no reply. The toilet was spacious and had grab rails. Sorry I don't seem to have a photo of this toilet and I can't honestly remember if there was a red emergency cord."
easter road stadium edinburgh,negative,"CAR PARKING Car parking (blue badge) is possible on Sinclair Street (opposite the North Stand).   However this fills up rapidly, so early arrival is recommended.  High density housing in the area means that street parking is very restricted (even with a blue badge)  LEAVING THE CARPARK This is a busy part of Leith and there can be unavoidable traffic congestion Would be easier if there was more space. Easter Road. Recommended blue badge parking on St Clair Street was full and on a very steep hill. No knowledge of public transport options."
easter road stadium edinburgh,positive,"I arrived under my own steam, or should I say power, using my powerchair. There is Blue Badge parking in St. Clair Street and a separate area for HDSA members as well as away fans. You can get more information on the HDSA website at www.hdsa.org.uk Immediately off the wheelchair viewing area is a doorway leading to a lobby and off that a good size accessible toilet. It was large enough to be able to turn my powerchair full circle. TOILETS and REFRESHMENTS Good access Parking available on St. Claire street but spaces go quick, so difficult to get parked on match days. Probably need to be there an hour before kick-off. Arrangements can be made for parking for disabled supporters and more information is available from the Hibernian Disabled Supporters' Association - www.hdsa.org.uk Each stand has accessible toilets in close proximity to the accessible seating areas. Accessible toilet was adequate and clean. Access is level but slightly awkward and difficult to see since faces away from the pitch on the middle of the access ramp. It may be smaller than comfortable for carer assistance but I would defer to carers for comment. There is designated parking close by that has a number of blue badge parking spots. Also there are a number of buses that head down Easter Road. There is a disabled toilet in the hospitality suite which was clean and a good size."
easterbrook bistro bar spa dumfries,positive,"We drove, plenty of designated accessible parking space outside the building, which are shared with Easterbrook Hall of which the Bistro and Spa are now part of . Very large carpark close by The Crichton Estate where the Bistro is located is served by local buses. Accessible toilet easy to find , the door is a bit difficult to manage on your own in the chair, but toilet large , clean, plenty of rails etc"
easterbrook hall dumfries,positive,"I travelled by wheelchair taxi. Huge  car park near the venue and several designated accessible spaces outside the building. A public bus service serves the Crichton estate from the town. Clean and fresh ,  large toilets ,plenty of room to manoeuvre. Plenty of grab rails in place, and assistance cord, I left  a couple of Euan’s guide red cord cards. Toilets are at each far end of the venue, quite a distance if you’re walking from the main hall"
eastgate shopping centre inverness,positive,"There is wheelchairs to borrow and there is room to move. There is 4 disabled toilets and they are very clean and spacious. If you plan on traveling to the shopping centre by public transport then you have a number of options -  If you're travelling by air then Inverness Airport is located 9 miles east of the city of Inverness and fifteen minutes’ drive from the city centre on the A96.  If you're travelling by bus then buses run regularly to the centre’s Falcon Square entrance and to the Inverness Bus Station and Union Street. Also Inverness Bus Station is situated at Farraline Park and is a short walking distance to Eastgate Shopping Centre, it would be a good idea to phone stagecoach at least 48 hours before you plan to depart to say that you plan on taking a wheelchair on the bus. If you plan by taxi then there are several taxi ranks in Inverness city centre, including outside the bus station, train station and at Eastgate Shopping Centre alongside Falcon Square. Also, Inverness Train Station is on Academy Street and right next door to the shopping centre. There are two car parks to choose from, the Eastgate Car Park and the Falcon Gallery Car Park. The Eastgate Car Park is right beside Millburn road. The Falcon Gallery Car Park  can be accessed from Millburn Road, each car park has loads of disabled car parking spaces and  are located close to Shopmobility and near lifts within the car parks. There are two sets of public toilets within Eastgate Shopping Centre. These are in the upper mall in the Centre (above Ernest Jones) and the lower mall next to the food court. Both sets of public toilets include accessible toilets for people with disabilities. In addition, the link bridge to Morrison’s supermarket provides further accessible toilets for people with disabilities. There is an intercom outside which will connect to the security department for any disabled person to use. "
eastwood health and care centre glasgow,positive,Large number of disabled parking spaces by the automatic doors although the rest of the car park can be very busy. Several bus stops nearby and train station also but this is fairly inaccessible. Although not actually at the cafe only a short distance passed reception desk is a fully accessible and large uncluttered disabled toilet
easyjet luton,negative,As a WCHC I got to prepare myself for a flight as I need hoisting for the toilet. If my urine bag gets full my wife discreetly empty's it.
eat glasgow,negative,"Limited parking, would be very busy in the day. All parking with meter machines. Centre of glasgow so frequent buses around but might be a bit confusing."
eat glasgow,positive,Disabled ground floor toilet. Although it is not obvious to find (back left). Good amount of room to manoeuvre. Has grab rails. Clean and tidy. Space for carer but might be quite tight. Has a changing place aswell. Upstairs toilets were shut at the time so cannot comment.
eat london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby. Some buses pass nearby in both Cheapside and New Change. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area. There is an essentially very good accessible toilet, but two stars lost because the red emergency cord had been idiotically tied up out of reach around a grabrail. This means that if anyone were to fall over during the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet, they would be unable to summon assistance. The red cord should hang freely all the way to the floor at all times. See my pictures below. The nearest tube station is Sloane Square, which is not step-free, but does have escalators from the westbound (but NOT the eastbound) platform to street level, so if you can get out of your wheelchair and take it up an escalator, this station may be an option. Loads of buses go along the King's Road. I wouldn't attempt to park nearby. This branch is in the heart of the City of London, right next to Leadenhall Market, with no step-free stations nearby. Bus routes run in the area, and I wouldn't dream of trying to park anywhere nearby."
eat london,positive,"Green Park station is nearby and is fully step-free, BUT check before you travel, as the lifts at this station are notoriously and disgracefully unreliable.   Several bus routes run up and down Piccadilly and will drop you off nearby. It is a rare pleasure to be able to award an accessible toilet five stars! This one is absolutely perfect, and very spacious too. See my picture below."
eataly roma rome,negative,"Toilets were the only thing not well signposted, but I did spot them. Didn't use them as they were being cleaned when I was there, so can't comment much."
eataly roma rome,positive,"There is a Metro station immediately beside this superstore, and a large car park for customers. It's on a quiet road, so traffic isn't too busy and there are no major roads to cross."
eaton farm nottingham,negative,Toilet is accessed using a radar key and is combined with baby changing facilities. There is limited turning space. The cord was tied up so I had to untie it. There were bars around the toilet but not around sink or on door. The flush handle wasn't adapted. Toilet is left sided transfer but you'd have to remove the bin. 
eaton farm nottingham,positive,The indigo (Trent Barton) stops near the pub. There are disabled parking pays near entrance to pub.
eats and treats the snug fochabers,negative,You can park on Fochabers high street right beside eats and treats.
ebano cafe puerto de la cruz,positive,The cafe is in a padestrianised road next to Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Peña de Francia. Cafe is on level ground but  surrounding streets have slopes. Taxis would be able to make a level stop nearby. 
ebony champagne cocktail bar durham,positive,"There is one disabled toilet located at the back of the bar. Access to the toilet is clear with no obstructions. There are two grab rails positioned around the toilet. Both attached to the back wall on the right hand side (when facing the toilet). There is a cord hanging from the ceiling on the left hand side of the toilet (again, when facing it) for use as an alarm. The sink is low enough for easy access and it a reasonable sized toilet with a sufficient amount of space."

eclipse cinema lifford strabane lifford,negative,"Disabled toilet and very easy to find as is located beside male and female toilets. Plenty of space to manoeuvre and for an extra person if needed. Grab rails included, along with an alarm cord."
eden camp modern history theme museum malton,negative,"Very tight and not too clean, was disappointed"
eden camp modern history theme museum malton,positive,"We drove and parked at the venue itself, not many Disabled spaces but lots of parking"
eden court theatre and cinema inverness,positive,"We drove there and there are eight disabled parking spaces available onsite; we had no problem parking, the road surface is tarmac and easy to negotiate.  When the theatre is busy, it can be difficult to find a disabled parking space but I've always managed to park somewhere on site nonetheless.  The theatre is about a 15-20 minute wheel/walk from both bus and train stations in the centre of Inverness. There is an accessible toilet available inside the theatre on the ground floor.  When entering the theatre, there is a one-way system in place with hand sanitising stations and Covid Safe instructions.  The toilet was very clean with room to manoeuvre, grab rails and a red cord.  Disabled bays are located at the side and back of theatre with level access  3 Disabled toilets all with grab rails, call cords, large rooms for a carer, one of these is on second floor"
eden garden centre kilmarnock,negative,"The car park has a couple of disabled spaces which are paved but I have been many times and they are always full. The rest of the car park is on a slight hill and is gravelled so quite difficult to navigate in a wheelchair.  Very small toilet. It is through two doors, both of which are fairly light. To get to the toilet you have to navigate through the bookstands and the high chairs which are stored behind the outer toilet door, making it so you cannot open the door fully. I have a very narrow manual chair but I still struggled.    In the small area between the doors, it is used as a storage area for a folded wheelchair and various cleaning supplies. This is also where the baby changing table is located. This narrows the space, making it hard/impossible to turn your chair around if necessary.   The mirror is too high to see yourself if are at a seated height and the taps are push taps which are fairly stiff so would not be accessible to those with weakened arm/hand strength.   No emergency red cord at all.  "
eden mill st andrews guardbridge,positive,"There is parking spaces available on the grounds of Eden Mill, right outside the dome where you take part in the experiences. Lines aren’t painted on the ground to show designated accessible parking spaces but, there is plenty of space for at least 5 cars to be evenly spaced out though.  I am not sure about the local transport in St Andrews as I am not from here however, it is at least a 10-minute drive outwith the city centre so I don’t think a lot of buses go past and you would have to get a taxi if you came into St Andrews by train. There are two on-site accessible toilets available for all visitors to use that are accessed by a platformed ramp. The toilets are like porta-cabins but, very spacious. Any sized wheelchair would fit and you would be able to have numerous people assisting you. Although even though it's very spacious, the toilet is tightly located in the left-hand side of the room so wheelchair users would only be able to transfer at the right-hand side.  Unfortunately, there isn’t a Changing Places toilet on-site and I’m not sure where the nearest one is. parking good with disabled bays and good bus and train links. Leaflets and website gives good directions good clean toilets, large enough and had a D handle so locking and unlocking the door was easy. Emergency chord easy to get to"
eden project bodelva,negative,"For those who have urgency or bladder incontinence it can be tricky finding the toilets as they are not well sign posted and can be a distance away.   Accessible facilities are open in the Visitor Centre and ground floor of the Link building (in between the Biomes).  A Changing Places toilet is also available in the Visitor Centre. The Changing Places accessible toilet in the Visitor Centre includes a height adjustable changing bench, a hoist system, shower and space for one person with a disability and up to two personal assistants.   We also have ADI toilets on site for the blind or visually impaired: one in the Link and one in the Visitor Centre."
eden project bodelva,positive,"There are three access designated car parks in Apple 1, Apple 2 and Banana. These are not solely limited to those who are in possession of a Blue Badge and can also be utilised by those who have mobility issues, require a wheelchair or have organised access assistance.   There are manual wheelchairs available in Apple 1 car park. To get to the Visitor Centre from Apple 1 car park you need to go down a tarmac path. The path is 32 metres long. The gradient is 1:18 with a short steeper section at 1:10.  If you park in a standard car park it can be a distance to walk to arrive at the eden project front entrance.  By car there are a large number of Disabled spaces just show blue badge to parking attendant There are busses and collection by car if bus is not possible numerous toilets all spacious and good in number Sinage is good Lots of parking for Blue Badge holders. We were directed to the car park nearest the attraction which was on fairly level ground and felt safe when using the wheelchair lift on the car as it was a quiet car park. They have regular toilets and accessible toilets throughout the Eden Project and also have a Changing Places toilet with a hoist and bench. Plenty of room for carers. The space enabled me to easily use the hoist to transfer my son from his large powered wheelchair, to the bench, then toilet and back again.  Plenty of disabled spaces near to the entrance. Superb with a hoist and bed and shower,best toilets i've seen anywhere. Blue badge holders use the car parks nearest the entrance. A signboard gives a phone number to use if you need staff assistance to get from the car to the entrance. The slopes to the car parks are very, very steep. Changing Places toilet at the main entrance building. Standard accessible toilets are at every location where there are also Ladies' and Gents' toilets, including both floors of the Link and the Core. Space not filled with bins/etc. There are many different disabled bays for car parking as well as a fully accessible park and ride bus that runs throughout the day from the car parks to the main visitor’s centre and vis versa.  There are toilets located in the visitor’s centre and the Link in between the biomes, they have room for wheelchair access plus assistance if needed. They also have hoists that can be used, an adjustable changing bench and a shower. The toilets are also fitted with a description service for those who are visually impaired describing the room making it easier for them to use the room.  There is disabled parking close to the entrance but the closest was full by mid morn."
edenmill farm shop blanefield,positive,"Disabled bays in the car park , some areas of gravel.  Quite a big disabled toilet with grab rails. "
edinburgh abc edinburgh,negative,"There is a disabled toilet with hand rails and a good size to manoeuvre a standard sized wheelchair however there is no ""changing places"" toilet."
edinburgh abc edinburgh,positive,"The car park is available throughout the day for parking, we had 2 minibuses. Once parked the car park is safe to use for cycling once cones are out. Flat surface and easy to walk on."
edinburgh airport edinburgh,negative,"The toilets were used for both disabled & baby change, This meant that the bins were overflowing with nappy sacks as no one had cleaned them. It was a drop of point. None at the holding area "
edinburgh airport edinburgh,positive,"Edinburgh Airport parking has a great new facility called FastPark which you can book online and is near the main terminal.  All you do is park your car in one of the ferry lanes unload your luggage and drop off yours and get a receipt all done automatically.  They will park your car for you and make sure it is there for you when you return,   The cars are all scanned on arrival so any disputes over damage can be resolved easily. Unfortunately this is the end of the good experience. I parked at a parking service near the airport which was excellent. Good toilet access My getting to the airport was a top class experience. I bought a ticket for the tram in the centre of Edinburgh, at St Andrew Square and lined my powerchair up with the wheelchair logo on the platform in anticipation. The long, snake like tube of the tram appeared from around the distant corner and gently glided alongside the level access platform. A great start not having to do battle with temperamental ramps and acrobatic manoeuvres. Two large clearly marked wheelchair spaces beckoned me in - you can choose which one and each faces the opposite direction. Handy, if like me you have a preference to see where you are heading; different to the backward seating position on buses.   Arriving at the airport it was easy to wheel off and follow the signs into the airport building. An enormous set of giant letters spelt out the word 'Edinburgh"" just before you went in - a great sport for the compulsory selfie that we are all so used to seeing. Not for me today, as it was pretty bleak weather with snow and rain belting around my ears and my fingers beginning to long for the gloves I forgot to pick up on my early morning dash out the door! As is often the way, when you first arrive somewhere you're not that interested in the shops, the visit, the things on offer until you have found the accessible toilet! I'm sure many folk share this experience. The airport did well in that it's accessible toilets are well signposted and I loved the notice by the lifts telling you about the availability of accessible toilets on each floor.  The loo I used was modern, well appointed and spotless. I chose to award four stars for toilets and whilst what they have is very good they don't yet have a Changing Places Toilet but I am told this will be rectified in the summer when they open a new Changing Places Toilet. So, well done ... Transport system to the Airport by private care, taxi, bus or tram excellent, no issues, minimal distance to the terminal."
edinburgh airport ingliston,negative,"Doors to toilets are far too heavy for me, but once inside it's a very standard loo Disabled taxi drop off  means quite a walk to the terminal. The taxi drop off is too far from the assistance  office. The taxi people were very kind and helpful as I could hardly stand after the nightmare from the plane door. If my husband had got too tired I would still be sitting in an empty aircraft corridor until the morning security people came on duty."
edinburgh airport ingliston,positive,"Very smart and spacious really useful. Only negative is the car park staff are often using the toilet which irritated me Driving to the airport was simple, well sign posted.  We opted for surface car parking, again well signposted to the disabled bay which there was a good amount of and well spaced out. Good effort with the toilets, could be a little cleaner. The transport is now much closer to the front door, though drop off disabled parking is further than the 50m standard for a blue badge. You have 20 minutes of free parking with a blue badge in the drop off area which is not adequately communicated on signage. Just press the assistance button on exit and put the badge in your window. Local tip: have your collection driver wait in the free park and ride car park 5 minutes from the airport until your flight has landed and you are ready to proceed to the collection area, then you can be sure not to go over the 20 minutes permitted. Lothian buses come close to the door but car park transfer buses can be a few hundred metres away. All the parking transfer buses I have ever used or seen have been accessible. Trams are a few hundred metres away, accessible and the trip from terminal to trams is flat with a good paved surface.  Door was a bit heavy but otherwise ok. The accessible toilet I used was large and certainly spacious enough to accommodate a career or PA if required. It was well equipped with grab rails and lowel level sink and hand dryer. The approach to the loo was clearly signposted and the signposting to the door had Braille as well as a visual sign. Toilets are usually clean and clearly marked. I did not use any toilets but they were all very well signposted. The buses drop off right outside the terminal and taxis have a specific drop off area which isn't too far from the entrance, however if you were traveling by yourself and had a lot of luggage it could be difficult. The car parking also has dedicated blue badge parking spaces at the closest point to the airport. Large toilet with everything you need and nice and clean. Only draw back was the door is a bit heavy!"
edinburgh bus station edinburgh,positive,"Access to the Staion is by lift at the west end and ramp at the east entrances, at the moment the whole area of the St. James Centre area is being redeveloped so the James Craig walk is closed. Well serviced by tram and bus services. Fully equipped and well serviced."
edinburgh butterfly insect world edinburgh,positive,Plenty of disabled Parking just outside the front entrance  Perfect There is a large carpark for this attraction especially as Dobbies Garden Centre is right across from it. We managed to park in the bays closest to the entrance.
edinburgh castle edinburgh,negative,"We walked up from the tram stop on Princes Street, but found the pavements and lack of dropped kerbs very challenging.  On the way back, I asked the mobility car driver where I could pick a taxi up from and she advised that the staff at the gate could ring one for me. The staff at the gate said that they couldn't ring a taxi for me but that there was a taxi rank just down the Royal Mile a bit. Unfortunately the taxi rank was inaccessible for me to get to due to steps, and I was unable to propel myself back up to the castle to ask for help, so I ended up with no option but to free-wheel back down to Princes Street in the slippery rain and having to deal with pavements and cross roads which weren't very wheelchair friendly."
edinburgh castle edinburgh,positive,"Parking near the castle can be a problem but you can park on the Esplanade by arrangement; just call the Castle dedicated line for parking - information is on their website.  Taxis can drop you off on the esplanade if required. Accessible toilets are available at various points throughout the castle. One is located at the main entrance and was spotlessly clean, tidy and modern. Another is in the Education block just off the castle square and others are available. Staff are happy to show you where the toilets are and even took me to them, helped with the doors, and suggested the best routes to get around. Visited the cafe and the disabled toilet there. Easily accessible on my scooter. Buses go very close but if you are in a manual wheelchair, you may want to take a cab up the steep hill. You can drive the car onto the esplanade and park for the duration of your visit. An accessible taxi then takes you to the top of the castle as being a fortress the roads are rough and steep.  A bit hard to find at the top of the castle, through the side door to the cafe. At the visitor point they are easily accessed beside the red phone boxes. Well appointed inside.  Got the bus to Princes Street Toilets near entrance, in the main square and in the cafe. All very clean and spacious. The accessible toilets in the museum and the main entrance were fine. Easy to find and with all the requisite facilities. You are able to drive right onto the large forecourt which is situation directly below the castle courtyard. This forecourt is where the Edinburgh Tattoo is staged - and parking here meant that you were only a short walk away from being inside the Castle grounds. It really is impossible to park any closer!  I'm pleased to say, despite the castles age, their disabled toilets aren't still stuck in the dark ages! I spotted ample toilet facilities on my way around the grounds, although I must profess, I never actually used the toilet myself, so cannot give an in-depth evaluation. Disabled toilets are present though.  The accessible toilet was fine in terms of access and space but it was very unclean. The nearest bus stop was about a five minute walk to the venue It's was amazingly easy to find"
edinburgh central youth hostel edinburgh,positive,"Almost in front of the hostel on Elm Row, there are local bus stops (the Lothian buses sounded like accessible). There was also a bus stop for the hop on hop off bus (Majestic Tour, accessible).   The hostel staff kindly called a taxi for us when we needed it, and it was able to park by the curb close to the main door, or on the opposite side of the Annandale Street when we came back to the hostel.  I don't know about parking options for passenger cars.   My friend pushed my wheelchair quite a lot. The tiles of the pavement around the hostel are reasonably flat and it was quite smooth for us to travel that way. For example, the crossroads from the hostel to the bus stop were quite easy to get over, there was some waiting area for pedestrians between the lines, and there are traffic lights, so you will get your turn to get over the streets even though there can be lots of traffic.  We travelled by public transport to Edinburgh and the location of the hostel is quite good. The hostel is a bit downhill (and not very far) from the York place tram station, which is the final stop of the airport tram. The Edinburgh bus station is reasonably close to York place too (but just by the bus station, there is a short but quite steep hill).   When we came back from the Old town/Princes Street direction, we followed Leith Street downhill to Omni Centre/Edinburgh Playhouse/York Place, and then continued slightly downhill towards the hostel. That was very handy! When we wanted to get to the other direction, my friend pushed the wheelchair quite easily to York Place, but if we wanted to get to Old town we used public transport to avoid steeper hills. Good for buses, but I'm not sure how much disabled parking there is in this area. My single room had a separate toilet and shower with a sink in the room. Close to reception they have a disabled toilet."
edinburgh city post office edinburgh,negative,never had a look to see what they were like but if its anything like the office its self I would be more than imprest.
edinburgh city post office edinburgh,positive,"Being Edinburgh City Centre, there is a lack of car parking spaces close by. However, there is an excellent public transport service with a number of buses stopping almost directly at the door and the nearest tram stops being a few minutes walk away, either on Princes Street (at the Mound) or St Andrews Square, with a couple minutes walk down the hill to Princes Mall."
edinburgh corn exchange edinburgh,negative,Inadequate parking for size of venue (significantly below government minimum number).  Disabled bays that were there were partly fenced off.    Served by the 35 bus right outside.    Main entrance has steps.  Alternative entrance not well signposted or always manned. 
edinburgh corn exchange edinburgh,positive,"Parking right outside, including disabled spaces. Bus 35 goes right past the door. Easy to find. The time we visited there were three marked places which appear not to be used for disabled parking, one had a trailer parked in it and another was blocked by a car parked randomly. However, there is a coned and marked area as well with approx. 5 parking spaces so there was ample places to park. Unfortunately ourselves and another party who used the disabled parking spaces (lady with a walking stick) were all gestured away from the access door next to the parking and told to go to the front of the building to gain access. This would have been just about ok for a wheelchair (depending on the wheel type/size) but was a nightmare for the rollator due to the size and layout of the cobbles.  The lady with the walking stick looked to be struggling too. Then at the front the difference in heights and gaps in the cobbles was difficult to negotiate. Thankfully when we got inside the attitude of the security team was excellent.  There is parking in the immediate area but dependent upon the event, it can be very busy.  The Lothian Buses No.35 service stops immediately outside of the Corn Exchange. Bus stops are on either side of the service road and there are dropped kerbs to facilitate crossing for wheelchair users. Unfortunately, cars felt they had a greater priority so two of the dropped kerbs were obstructed. You may have to travel 100 metres to find the next drop kerb if this happens during your visit. There is an accessible toilet in the main foyer area. It has a wide easy to use door, grab rails and plenty of space. It was clean and tidy.  Staff will show you where the toilet is situated if you ask as it's not immediately obvious.  There's a cloakroom service if you want to leave your coat and bags while you enjoy the event. No. 35 bus to the door; Slateford train station near. There's parking on the street near the Corn Exchange  - and there's also a big Asda nearby where you could park if you need to. There are several bus routes that stop at the Corn Exchange - we took 44. Plus Slateford Station is nearby although I'm not sure how accessible that is."
edinburgh farmers market edinburgh,negative,There are no accessible toilets on site but there are accessible toilets on the lower levels of the adjacent car park. It can be a bit of a climb down and back up the ramps.
edinburgh farmers market edinburgh,positive,The market is adjacent to the Multi story car park. It can be a pit of a climb if you aren't on the very top deck. It may be possible to park on street with a Blue Badge.
edinburgh festival fringe at george square edinburgh,negative,Parking near to the Square is difficult as there aren't many spaces.
edinburgh festival fringe at george square edinburgh,positive,Great to see an accessible loo has been included in the toilet provision.  Just follow the signs for the toilets and the accessible loo is tucked around the corner.
edinburgh festival fringe at george street edinburgh,negative,Limited on street parking due to one lane of the road being closed in places. Conventional toilets have been built by the pop-up bar but no accessible loos.
edinburgh festival fringe at parliament square edinburgh,negative,Parking or any vehicular access to this part of town during the Festival is very much a non-starter. The nearest low floor accessible buses pass along George IV Bridge which is 500 metres or so from the Square. Much of the road is closed for the Festival period.
edinburgh festival fringe at the mound edinburgh,positive,"A great spot for getting to, as I do, by public transport. The tram stopped a couple of hundred metres away. A great roll-on roll-off service if you're a wheelchair user.  There are loads of bus stops nearby and all the buses are low floor wheelchair accessible including the AirLink bus to the airport, the many tourist buses, and the local services.  Taxis are able to drop off at the Mound if that's your chosen transport. There are several accessible toilets in the adjacent Galleries."
edinburgh festival fringe at west end fair edinburgh,negative,Buses stop outside the church in Lothian Road.
edinburgh house hotel edinburgh,negative,"There is no disabled parking.  The number 11 bus to and from the city centre drops off / picks up close to the hotel and served me just fine. There is no accessible loo.  The toilet was low and for me this proved the most problematic of the facilities, as there were no grab rails."
edinburgh international book festival edinburgh,negative,"Parking is a challenge in this part of Edinburgh, particularly during Festival time.  Some guidance was given on their website and wheelchair dropping off was available at the front entrance.  How-ever we contacted them to ask if it was possible for parking to be arranged for the Day Service’s bus and reserved parking provision was made for us in Charlotte Square.   I’m not familiar enough with central Edinburgh to comment on buses and trams, but for our group of people public transport is usually too much of a challenge anyway.  They are more likely to use cars or minibuses. Parking is probably the most tricky aspect as it is a central city square with very limited scope for vehicle access. That said it was a short distance from Princes Street with its many buses and trams.   I enjoyed wheeling along George Street from St Andrew Square and its handy tram stop. The Book Festival is a split site with the main focus on Charlotte Square and other activities at the far end (West end) of George Street. Parking and transport is a bit tricky as it is a city centre garden square. You can be dropped near the entrance if required. The Square is very close to the West End of Princes Street where there are loads if transport connections. Parking is probably one of the weak spots as it is not easy to park in the area. That said, it is true of so many places in the city during the festivals. Bus travel was easier with Princes Street only a short five minute walk away.  Sadly parking around Charlotte Square is not great and the height of some kerbs made getting around as a powerchair user tricky. That said, public transport was close to hand with teams and buses a short distance away on Princes Street. The buses and trams were accessible with dedicate wheelchair space."
edinburgh international book festival edinburgh,positive,"Loving the new drop off ramp! Makes such a difference! If you’re not being dropped off then definitely use the George Street crossing to get across to Charlotte Square as the pavements are pretty vicious elsewhere! There’s a great accessible loo - and even better there’s a fab Changing Places toilet!!  For the first time the EIBF provided a fully accessible Changing Place toilet in a specially adapted portacabin.  This ensured that people from my daughter’s day service and other visitors who required a hoist and changing bed were able to come to the EIBF this year. Other accessible toilets were also provided.  The toilets are situated immediately to the left inside the venue so are readily accessible to people on arrival. Amazingly good. In a word or two - the provision of the Changing Places Toilet is a deal breaker for so many people! If you're not too sure what this is .... It's a toilet which has more space than an average accessible loo so there's room for carers and personal assistants. It has an adult changing bench, a hoist, a loo, a sink, a privacy screen, and a welcome feeling!  Along side the Changing Places unit there is an accessible loo with powered door which is handy. On the George Street site you will find another accessible loo.  If you are looking for baby changing facilties; the site has these as well tucked in the far corner. Please don't use the Changing Places Toilet for baby changing unless you have access requirements. That was my only concern as I had to wait to use the C P Loo as it was occupied with by a mother changing a baby. Note to Festival Organisers - perhaps a sign on the C P door explaining what it is and also directing parents looking for baby changing facilties to those facilties. Top marks for having an accessible toilet that was easy to find, easy to wheel into, large enough for a book reading in its own right, and spotlessly clean and tidy. There are several buses that stop nearby and the tram is a 5 - 10 minute walk away. I didn't use them but there are accessible and a Changing Places toilet. Easy for us as we came on the 124 bus which stops on Lothian Road - then it is a 10 min walk / wheel to Lauriston Place. Edinburgh being Edinburgh there are some hills to navigate! There are other buses though that do stop on Lauriston Place itself which would be even more convenient! Top marks for the toilets! The main accessible loo in the Square even had an automatic door - a great plus for me and many others who are powerchair users. Equally notable was the accessible loo in the George Street complex - full marks to the designers who built a ramp that allowed enough space to turn to get in and out of the door - a feature missing in all the other pop up loos I've visited during the festivals. Once inside the loos were very spacious and allowed for a carer to easily move around.  Near to Waverley and Haymarket train stations, plus trams and good bus links. The accessible loo - for me was one of the highlight .... I've never in many years of visiting pop up venues as a powerchair user seen a loo with such a good ramp access and an automated door. No more acrobatics to try and balance on a ramp and open a door ! Once inside there was space to 'have a party' .... Beautifully clean, spacious and well appointed.  Bus, tram and on street parking. Took 34 bus from home near Slateford Road to Princes Street opposite Castle then trundled up Castle Street to cruise George Street to Charlotte Square... Bus driver very helpful... Far better than an 'accessible loo' was the Changing Place provision. Generous spaces for access to usual facilities plus adult size changing 'shelf'. The Book festival is never going to be perfect for getting there as it is a pop up venue in a town square. With traffic on all four sides it was a problem but this year the northern side of the square has an accessible drop off point, with access ramp and no sense of being hurried. The buses all run along nearby Princes Street or you can opt to take a tram. May be get off at St Andrew Square and enjoy a meander along George Street taking in the shows, the open air bars and cafes on the way. Once you arrive in the main entrance there is a handy ""Accessibility"" stand where folk can tell you all about the accessibility or offer help and advice.  Top marks for having a Changing Places toilet on site. Adjacent was an accessible toilet and alongside toilets for everyone."
edinburgh international climbing arena ratho,positive,Very good car park and plenty of disabled spaces. Car park very close to the entrance. Toilet was very spacious.
edinburgh international conference centre edinburgh,negative,"Did not drive, and nearest bus stops on Lothian road which does not make it that easy to access. There may be a car park, however as I did not use this, I am unsure. Buses either to Morrison street, just a couple of mins walk, or to Lothian road, again a short walk.  I am unsure about the nearest bus stop to EICC. I was dropped off by a family member in a car (Blue badge holders can park on single yellow lines, drop off where it is accessible.) From the drop off point it was around 10 metres roll to the main entrance. Signage to the centre and entrance was quite poor. I was expecting signs around the streets that told me this is where the vaccination centre was but you could only see NHS banners on the front entrances. On a busy city centre road there isn't much scope for parking. There is a drop off area which is handy. That said, I arrived by tram and from the West End it was a ten minute walk."
edinburgh international conference centre edinburgh,positive,"I used my scooter to get from the town centre. There are nearby carparks, busses and taxis and a huge amount of useful information about getting there on their won website. All adequate and good that there were disabled toilets on every level. The one I used I added a red cord card. All the expected grab rails and clean. Plenty of bus choices and nearby to Haymarket train station. Spacious toilets, not overcrowded with bins  Disabled toilet near entry. Plenty of toilets on all floors and easy to find. I didn’t need to use the toilet this time but again I can confirm from previous visits as a comedy venue that the accessible toilets are there and large enough for a powerchair user plus a carer. Nearby buses and close to Haymarket train station and tram stop Several accessible toilets - and clearly sign posted. Not far to go to find one from any location in the building as they are on all floors. Spacious, clean and bright. I got a taxi both times and was dropped off outside the centre.  Yes, Although I did not personally use them. Checked the accessible loo in the lobby, it was clean and spacious. "
edinburgh international festival at festival square edinburgh,negative,"Bus stops, with accessible buses, are nearby so it's only a short walk away. Parking on the other hand is a bit of non-starter in this part of town."
edinburgh playhouse edinburgh,negative,"The Omni Centre car park is really the only decent place to park nearby - especially when there’s roadworks. But it’s expensive.  not nearly enough disabled parking access, have to constantly vie for space with taxis and coaches The accessible loo is in the bar, which is fine when it is quiet, but difficult to get to when it's busy, and other members of the public are using it! As accessible looks go it is roomy, but I've seen cleaner loos!"
edinburgh playhouse edinburgh,positive,"Clean, although not particularly spacious.  Taxi rank immediately outside.   Limited parking available (on double yellow lines with a blue badge) at Picardy Place car park. Accessible loo available inside the circle bar. Spacious with lots of grab rails. I don't know bout actual parking spaces for disabled drivers as would use a taxi as described above. It's maybe not the best to take a car to anyway as very busy. Taking a taxi gets round that problem. Next door at the omni centre.. Didn't park this time as we stayed over but have used before "
edinburgh printmakers edinburgh,negative,You can park on street next to building if you have blue badge.  Single yellow line.
edinburgh printmakers edinburgh,positive,"This venue is located in the Fountainbridge area of Edinburgh on Dundee Street. There is a car park at the rear of the building. I took an Uber to this venue from Waverley station and was able to be dropped off right outside the door.  There are accessible toilets on site.  Very spacious toilet with grab rails  There's one accessible loo on the cafe level, which we used, and the signage indicated that there is another in the basement and also an accessible shower. The loo on the cafe level is well-equipped with grab rails, and approachable washbasin and Dyson hand-dryer. The alarm cord was looped round one of the grab rails by the toilet, so not quite reaching the ground, so we remedied that. Our only comments would be that a wheelchair user wanting to side transfer would first have to move a large litter bin, and that Wheelchair Girl found the loo roll dispenser hard to reach. Otherwise excellent. Accessible clean and spacious toilets On the 35 bus route, parking along the side i think which you can then gaon access via the courtyard. We walked though so don't have that direct experience  Didn't use them but if they are in the same league as everywhere else, they'll be good. This is a newly renovated community space. "
edinburgh rugby edinburgh,negative,Despite  Edinburgh Rugby saying there would be ample disabled parking - there is not.  We have to use the cricket club's car park which is too small and very poorly lit.  Plus it is a fair treck to the ground - across a busy road too!  It is on a bus route though.
edinburgh trams edinburgh,positive,"It is easy to park at Edinburgh Airport but you have to get a bus to get to York Place. The tram stops are in handy locations around the city, close to other transport links such as bus stops. The stop at the airport is really good, and there always seems to be someone on hand to help you find your way or purchase tickets."
edinburgh underbelly edinburgh,negative,"It was clean and tidy and easy to find. BUT it's a tight squeeze in a manual chair and took some effort to get out successfully. I'd be worried about the turning circle in a power chair but could not find an alternative.  We visited by car. Disabled parking is not well sign posted  nor particularly near, especially as lots of No Parking restrictions on single yellow lines throughout the Festival. Nearest bus stops would be in Forrest Road or Lauriston Place. There was an accessible loo signposted besides the ladies and gents but I spotted another one on our way in. It had a hand rail, was clean and stocked with loo rolls, hand towels and soap. On the negative side it was quite small to negotiate opening/closing the door and we just had a manual wheelchair."
edinburgh underbelly edinburgh,positive,"Like most of the city parking is not straightforward, George Square is closed for the Festival so the best option is to park opposite Central Mosque and walk through as it's pedestrianised from there. Buses are frequent and accessible, this is the option we use anywhere in the city.  There is nearby on street parking and good bus links. There wasn’t a disabled toilet in the building so they built one. The toilet that was there was smaller so they have expanded it by adding a wooden wall which is incredibly tasteful for the venue and actually looks like it’s been there the whole time! Bus took us to basically just outside the venue. As it's in the city centre there are lots of buses that connect to it. I used the Skylink 300 which as long as you're not going to the airport only costs £1.70 and is about a 2 minute walk from the venue.  Didn't use the restroom but it was clearly labelled and visible. "
edinburgh waverley railway station edinburgh,negative,"The toilets are operated by Radar key which can I find quite frustrating at the best of time but having to wait for a staff member to open/close the entrance gate adds to that frustration. If arriving by Taxi not all of them can take you  onto the concourse. And there are new arrangements in place for Blue Badge holders for drop off and pick up. For up to date information refer to the station website. Accessible parking is available in the main car park. This does require you to use two lifts to get to the ticket office and main area. There is no longer vehicle access to the main station area for cars or taxis.   A new accessible drop off point, and presumably pick up has been created off Carlton Road. You pull into a turning circle area to drop off. A lift takes you to the bridge and a second down on to platform level. When booking assisted travel staff can meet you at the accessible drop off point. We did not arrive by car, as we knew in advance that parking would be a problem for disabled, so arrived by train. General buses all seem to arrive and depart along Princess street, so no problems there for us, as our hotel stood right opposite Waverley station on Princess street. Very dirty and unhygienic I always walk, taxi or bus to this station - but there is a large carpark available. The buses stop right outside on Princes Street, and you can take a lift down into the station. Alternatively there are escalators (often out of order) or steps. The best taxi rank is at what I would call 'the back' of the station just off Calton Road. It is a drop-off area with a lift up to a footbridge and another lift down into the centre of the station where there is often a market on Fridays. "
edinburgh waverley railway station edinburgh,positive,"Excellent. You approach the turnstiles but the main accessible loo is just before this. The attendants will often come out and open the door for you and help you through the crowd queuing for the standard toilets. There is an accessible toilet just before the barriers to the main toilet area. It is opened by a staff member or can be opened with a RADAR key. It's clean and fairly spacious although it does require a tight ninety degree turn to access the door. Only a drop of area but lits of buses and taxis close by. Obviously lots of trains! I tend to walk or get the bus to the station. Plenty of busses stop nearby on Princes Street or North Bridge. The airport bus leaves just outside the station on Waverley Bridge. Their are usually Taxis parked on Waverley Bridge or just off Carlton Road, which is also where you'll find the accessible drop off point. The nearest tram stop is at St Andrew Square. There is a car park but I have never used it. There are many buses that stop outside Waverley Steps and also a taxi rank. Unsure about parking situation. I used the accessible toilet on the main platform level. It was signposted clearly and open when I went to use it. Usually I think its locked with a RADAR key. There was enough room for myself in a powerchair to go in and turn etc. There is a Changing Places toilet at the Wetherspoons next door however I’m not sure what their opening hours are like / if the toilets are open to non-customers. Accessible toilet on main concourse. Helpful staff who will get the door for you."
edinburgh zoo edinburgh,negative,There were plenty of transport facilities.  There was a lot of disabled parking and plenty of transport facilities. 
edinburgh zoo edinburgh,positive,"The car park is near to the main entrance. There are a row of accessible parking bays which made it easy.  The accessible toilets are open. The other public toilets have been reconfigured in places and there is new signage to show people which way to enter. The one beside the entrance was huge. Unfortunately so was the queue! My evening at the Zoo started by arriving on the bus. Lothian buses are accessible and the Airlink bus stopped just across the road from the entrance. The bus stop to make my way home was right outside the entrance. Couldn't get much closer if you tried. There are several accessible toilets throughout the Zoo. The one I used was good. There was plenty of space and room for a carer. It had grab rails and the sink and dryer were all within easy reach. On top of that it was really clean and tidy. I find it really easy to get the bus here - the stop is right outside the main entrance to the zoo. There is also a large car park on a steep hill.  There are a few disabled car parking spaces at the main car park into the zoo. There are many accessible toilets throughout the Zoo. There is a good amount of space available in the toilet. I got the bus the whole way, the 12 from Leith walk, there is a stop in front of the zoo on both sides of the road. I used one toilet that was accessible. It was huge with plenty of space, but at 8 p.m. it wasn’t the cleanliness.  We took a taxi to just before the entrance. There was a big car park with several disabled car parking spaces. Parking was not used but there is a bus that brings you straight to the park from the center of Edinburgh which was incredibly useful, as we passed through it to get to the zoo many places to park were visible.  Guided to disability parking by staff, and given directions into the zoo from the car park.  We didn't use the transport within the zoo but it was offered to us and if we hadn't been short for time we would have definitely used it. accessible but no changing facilities/hoisting equipment. Blue badges get free parking. The parking was a bit hit and miss as the car park was covered in frost. The normal disabled facilities all seemed to be open.  The zoo is on a hill, taking a carer, who gets in free, would be advised as it is a bit steep at times.  The zoo transport to the top is not avaliable.  Never used the facilities.  Though there is not currently a changing places toilet this is something they are adding in early course, the accessible loo near the reception was nice and big and clean and as it was quiet the day I went there was no queue."
edinburghs christmas at virgin money street of light edinburgh,positive,It's easy to get to the Royal Mile either by bus or taxi. Not sure where the nearest Blue Badge parking is. If you're getting there under your own steam then remember it's at the top of a hill!
edith cavell building norwich,positive,"Two disabled bays directly outside of building with dropped kerb at one end. Unfortunately the delivery drivers frequently use and partially block them. There is a disabled loo on each floor. These are large with grab rails, alarm cords and mirrors. "
edradour distillery pitlochry,negative,"Two accessible spots marked in the carpark, car park slopes so they'd but them in the flattest part... But was further to walk."
edradour distillery pitlochry,positive,"The loos in the bar area are lovely, not changing places but plenty large enough for large wheelchair, user and carer. Space for transfer made a nice change. Spotlessly clean!   The only thing is that the accessible loos are in the main toilet area... I didn't look but assume another accessible cubicle in the gents.  Would make mixed sex user/client a bit of an issue for some."
eds easy diner edinburgh,positive,Ample disabled parking immediately outside
ee airdrie airdrie,negative,There is no parking in this area the nearest parking would be in the Hallgraig St Car park this is the street that runs parallel with Graham St and can be accessed using one the side streets . The nearest is at the side of Boots however this is a one way street and is always busy. The nearest toilet is at the Car park in Hallgraig Street and is near to the traffic lights on this part of the road. The toilet is for use by anyone as there is only one unit it can be opened using a Radar Key. The unit is also one of the automatic self clean types and takes a few minutes to be ready after someone has used it.
ee didcot didcot,negative,there are disabled parking spaces in front of the Sainsbury's store but after that you have to walk up a long slope or steps to reach the store.  My Dad was worn out before we got there from the distance and increased level of the store 
eglise notre  dame  la  grande poitiers,negative,"We drove there and found quite a few disabled spaces dotted around the town centre; we parked opposite the police station and meandered through Poitiers which was about a ten minute wander from there to the church.  Meandering is highly recommended as there are lots of architectural treasures, museums and shops throughout Poitiers. There is a train station but it was at the foot of the city and it would be a steep uphill climb and although there are buses, I'm not sure if they were accessible. "
ego restaurant lichfield,negative,"There is parking about 10 disabled spaces in a big car  park, where disabled park for free about 60 yards from the restaurant. You could pull up outside to be dropped off as they did have a few chairs inside the door No accessible toilet - there was one bigger toilet - not big enough to get a wheelchair in but comfortable enough for a person with walking difficulties. There were no handrails to help you up off the toilet so if this is something you struggle with this could be an issue"
ego sheffield,positive,"Parked in nearby multistorey.  Some on street parking fairly close by. City centre venue so buses and trams quite near. Easy to find and is accessed  'straight on' so no awkward manoeuvres.  Clean, roomy, grab rails."
eightyeight ripon,positive,Accessible WC is on the lower floor but easy to access from either area. Grab rails are in place and there is sufficient room
eildon holiday cottages melrose,positive,"Parking outside front door Spacious wetroom  Car parking space right outside the door. Toilet with trombone arm, grab bars, wet room shower, shower chair, plenty of room. Parking was right next to the front door and level, thus providing easy access to and from the vehicle. There was a good sized wet room in the downstairs bedroom which is easily accessible by wheelchair."
el aderno puerto de la cruz,positive,The local bus stops close by or you can get a taxi which will stop outside.
el cafeto barcelona,negative,"Close to La Rambla where there are lots of buses and Metro stops. Parking isn't great, and the street El Cafeto is on is a narrow pedestrianised street. Two toilets right at the back of the restaurant, access is pretty tight. Inside there is one male and one female toilet and a shared sink - but nobody seems to care about the differentiation, so I believe you can use whichever. The accessible toilet is in the one labelled as the female toilet. It's spacious, but pretty rickety which is the main reason stars were dropped."
el coloso apartments benalmadena,positive,We didn't have a car. There is private parking onsite. I don't know how many disabled spaces there are but there seems to be plenty of space.
el corte ingles lisbon,positive,We came by Metro. Car park under store. It is on the Ho Ho Bus route.  One of the best I have seen. Lots of circulation and transfer space. Adjustable full size sink. Emergency Cord all around wall at 300mm but not colour contrasted. Rails  to toilet have front parts the extend. 
el faro mejilloneria torrevieja,negative,"No parking for the venue, on-street parking nearby. Pavements are high, with lots of dropped kerbs and driveways meaning lots of up and down slopes."
el ferrer de tall vilanova de sau,negative,Don't know about public transport. You'd need a car and be ready to stop and take photos. On street parking. Didnt see any blue badge spaces. 
el ferrer de tall vilanova de sau,positive,Clean. Easy to get to.morror too high as usual.
el patio puerto de la cruz,positive,"The restaurant is located in a pedestrian square. There is a bus station quite close, but I didn't see it. I took a taxi to the nearby Plaza Charco and walked there in a few minutes."
el piano york,negative,The toilets are located towards the rear of the restaurant with and uneven entry to the toilet. The toilet is unisex and not for the sole use of disabled people. There is manoeuvring space enough for a wheelchair and there are transfer rails and support bars present. Also the toilet has an emergency alarm. The tap uses lever and it mixes both hot and cold water and an automatic hand dryer is available.
elba carlota beach convention resort antigua,negative,"The bathroom was also spacious, with a shower glassed off (although the panel moved back and a handrail along the wall)  The shower was powerful and easily adjusted.  The hotel supplied a shower chair which was very useful.  I needed my wife’s assistance to get this over the ‘lip’ around the floor of the shower however. There was ample room for me to use my wheelchair at the sink, which had sufficient space for toiletries, although there was another shelf in the room for these. It was with the ‘loo’ that I struggled however.  I found it very low (I am used to a raised one) and in hindsight I ought to have hired a raiser.  In photographs I had been sent, they showed a grabrail on the left.  Alas this room only had one on the right which I found a problem as I can only use my left arm/hand."
elderburn lodges st andrews,positive,"There is specially allocated concrete driveway at the front of cottage 6 which allows for easy wheelchair access. There is a wide gravel driveway leading into the location. We use our disabled access vehicle to get around. Cottage has full wheelchair accessible wet room with spacious open shower, sink and toilet. Room to manoeuvre with grab rails and space for carer. Very clean and tidy."
elephant coffee neston,positive,"There is no parking directly for the use of customers. On the street there is a layby near to the Elephant Coffee approximately 25m away, which has a limited time for parking and often filled. Around the back of the café is a free public car park approximately 100m away, which consists of disabled parking spaces for permit holders, as well as concreted ramp paths out of the car park. Outside of the Elephant Coffee is a set of traffic lights making it not possible to stop outside. The Elephant coffee has one unisex disabled toilet for customers. The door opens out into the café, making access easier. There is a large space within the toilet with transfer rails which can be moved out of the way, and grab rails. The toilet is taller than the basic, making it easier for transfers, whilst the sink is lower and accessible for someone in a wheelchair. There is an alarm for assistance if required in the toilet cubicle."
elephant hill haumoana,positive,"Parking is close to the entrance. But you need your own transport or get a taxi. Plenty of room inside, located just of dining room with other toilets. Grab rails only beside toilet."
elgin cathedral elgin,positive,"Parking was easy with plenty of on street space if you have a Blue Badge. Being in the heart of Elgin there is plenty of public transport. There's a railway station and bus station offering connections to further afield. Walkable from city center with public transport. Parking close by. Didn't use them but they were there. I got a taxi to Elgin Cathedral so I can't comment too much on the parking. However, I do know that on-street parking is available several metres from the cathedral. Visitors can be dropped off at the entrance. An adapted toilet is inside the shop. However, the toilet is tight but manageable."
elgin library elgin,positive,There are 4 disabled car parking spots right outside the library.
elim church edinburgh,negative,"The disabled toilets are located within the normal visitor toilets, however, due to the layout, you may require assistance with the doors"
ellaberry holiday cottage hilton,negative,"Two loos - one in en suite wet room (so handy for nighttime visits) and one in shared bathroom.  One room is very small, the other very large - neither have grab rails. However I managed using the wall and my walker to hold onto when getting up.  I would suggest portable aids to assist I use of the loos and showers (see below). The wet room shower area has a pebbled floor - which wasn't slippery. As it was a small shower i could use walls to balance. There was a shortage of places to put shampoo etc so used walker. Shower in shared bathroom ironically as a fixed seat but a 12 inch step up in"
ellaberry holiday cottage hilton,positive,"Not sure if buses come nearby but suspect not as it's so remote. We drove. There's plenty of parking right outside this and the next door cottage. I would estimate the parking bays are about twenty meters or so from the front door, across a courtyard."
ellenborough park cheltenham,negative,"We parked in the 11 disabled bays available, as described in part one, ( and it has a lot to say about parking here, so please read part one) Small, simple clean toilet, which a wheelchair could turn around in, but nothing to write home about. This was one reason we did not offer higher marks, because on all our travels we never did get so upset by trying to park our car. It is easy enough to follow Sat NAV directions to the hotel, but we got a bit confused as to where to park. A fork along the driveway suggests that traffic turn left at a fork, but we could see that disabled parking was over to the right at the fork, and we went that way. We found 11 disabled parking bays, great, and we managed to find one right by the ramp to go  Odown to the hotel, (photo 10). Then perhaps our own fault, but we did not read the signs for reception correctly, as arrow pointed us to go down to reception, and everything seemed to then point us towards the wing to the left for reception, and we did indeed follow that line, but got ourselves completely lost in the maze of the hotels buildings. And time after time we followed instructions for reception, until signs finally disappeared and we were lost. Now remember, you have two late 70,s  Disabled people trying to find reception in a maze of corridors and various buildings, so we sadly allowed things to get on top of us, until, gratefully, we met a gentleman returning to his room who showed us the way to go for reception, which was we noted on the other side of the complex of buildings, nwhere near were we where at that moment. Now we know, ( THE DISABLED BAYS ARE FOR PARKING FOR THE USE OF DISABLED ROOMS AND OTHER FACILITIES IN THIS WING ). and nothing to do with finding the reception area, which is in another building completely. So after many miles of walking around passages, my wife struggling  to push this old gentleman along, ( at this point I was just about remaining a gentleman ), dragging our wheelchair up a number of steps, turning corner after corner, we eventually found the reception. Oh my, where we tired and upset by now, so you have been warned, take no notice of disabled bays at this point in time, just follow notice to turn left at junction, and follow that drive round many bends, passing walled areas, until after quite a ride you will arrive at the front of the Hotel itself, and find the reception. Talk about frustration, so we feel this must be sorted by management to make it clear on where to park for reception first, then worry about driving back to disabled bays, and by the way, there was not a single disabled bay by the reception entrance, just about a dozen parking areas, and these were all full anyway. You will get a better understanding of what we have written here if you take a look at our photos, ( from number 9 to 16 ).  So this is one reason why we offer just 4 stars for this hotel. We found disabled toilet behind the Horse Box restaurant, easy enough to get to, clean and tidy, and we managed to turn wheelchair in there, as everything else was crammed up close together on far wall to allow wheelchair to get inside. There were grab rails and pull cord however.  "
elmers cafe cardiff,negative,"The manager/owner offered to help me if I needed assistance to get to the toilet. I told him I write reviews for Euan's Guide and asked if the toilet was fully accessible for anyone who was confined to a wheelchair. He said that there were support rails inside. I wasn't able to see for my self as it was occupied but the door was only as wide as that of a normal, internal door so I doubt whether anyone who needed to place their wheelchair alongside the toilet in order to move from the chair to the toilet seat would be able to do so."
elms farm cottages boston,positive,"Elms Farm has a large car park at the rear of the cottages. All cottages are accessible from the car park via a flat path to the courtyard and cottage front doors. Some of the cottages are accessible via rear doors directly from the car park. Elms Farm is at Hubbert's Bridge outside Boston which is served by public transport including buses and rail. We didn't use public transport so visitors would be advised to check whether it's suitable for your individual access needs. In our cottage, the en-suite accessible toilet and shower were ideal. The cottage does not have a hoist, therefore, if you are a portable hoist user, speak to Carol to check what facilities can be put in place for you or to confirm your own portable hoist will fit in the wet room. For non-hoist users, there are multiple grab rails and bars and a portable shower seat so the toilet and shower facilities should be more than adequate. Please note, each cottage is individual, you should check in advance what facilities are available in your chosen cottage, Carol will be more than happy to advise before booking."
elsie mays electric lounge saint neots,negative,"There is disabled parking on the market square just for disabled people. However, the pavement is partially cobbled and cars were parked up on the pavement making me have to go into the road. The only toilet is not at all accessible."
eltham palace and gardens london,negative,"I don't know the area well, but for wheelchair users it's best to get the Jubilee Line to North Greenwich station (fully step-free) and then from Bus Stop C get the 132 to the stop called 'Eltham Church/Well Hall Road'. From that stop continue in the same direction as the bus was going. Fingers crossed that the bus driver isn't the moron who ignored the blue bell alert, didn't deploy the ramp for me, and drove off with me still on board."
eltham palace and gardens london,positive,"There is a good accessible toilet near the Great Hall. The door is a bit too heavy and cumbersome, and there is no emergency cord, so I've knocked off a star for these two points. The lack of emergency cord is a really serious omission: people do fall over, and need to summon help quickly, especially if bones are broken."
elvaston castle country park derby,positive,The disabled loo next to the shop was inaccessible to me due to building work.   The disabled loo located in the cafe was too small too turn around in (mostly due to two bins). The toilet had white grab rails and so did the sink. Transfer was from the left.   Near the entrance of the park there is a changing places toilet with changing table and hoist. There was enough space for a powered wheelchair and a carer. Toilet and sink had contrasting grab rails in navy. Transfer could be from left or right if didn't nee to use hoist. Radar key is required to access this toilet. 
elvis shakespeare edinburgh,positive,"no parking, but in Leith Walk on the main bus route."
ely railway station ely,negative,Car park and taxis just outside but not used.  Not usable for me due to right hand support rail too far from the toilet. The ramp through to Tesco next door had a step at the end and the Tesco toilet had broken support rail and was grubby. 
emirates air line london,negative,"There are no toilets at the cable-cars themselves. There are toilets, including changing places, at the o2 We started our ride - and hence this review is written from that point of view - from N Greenwich and went over to Emirates Royal Docks.  Due to the location, you need to take public transport. I know that North Greenwich tube is nearby (it's very near the O2).. We arrived by river and it was a leisurely two to three minute stroll/push from North Greenwich pier. Easy level route which was very well signposted. Over the other side of the river, we walked a short distance to Royal Victoria tube, which is on the DLR. It was all quite easy and well signed. No specific parking so we parked in the station by the O2 Arena (free if you don't go in the main car park but follow the coach only and wheelchair signs to a few accessible bays).  A ten minute walk to the cable cars (a small section on the road due to lack of dropped kerb)."
emirates arena and sir chris hoy velodrome glasgow,negative,"Only one disabled toilet out site on the level. Spacious with lots of handrails. Hand rails, toilet sear etc... Were not contrasting colours from standard white furniture. Hand rails, toilet sear etc... Were not contrasting colours from standard white furniture."
emirates arena and sir chris hoy velodrome glasgow,positive,"Plenty of parking, great cafe, good loos and loads of sport thrown in! Really accessible parking Easy to access. Maybe more toilets and better signs? Parking is great at the venue There is lots of toilets Plenty of Disabled Parking if needed near the venue. Nextbike Hire Bike Docking Station at the centre with plenty of space for personal bikes also.  Accessible toilets on the ground floor near the lift.  Great lot's of spaces and a flat curb  There is some but not easy to spot  If travelling by car, large area of carpark with disabled parking bays. Seemed good layout with room around each parking bay.  Although it was busy for the event when we were there, there were staff directing the traffic as it arrived/left. This was well organised, it did take a bit of time for everyone to get out, but seemed to go smoothly.  I don't know about public transport to here. There are lots of accessible toilets in the building, there are many around the arena.  All that I saw were roomy enough to have a wheelchair and carer in, if required. Baby changing facilities were not sharing this space.  I noticed in several of them though, the emergency pull-cords were tucked in behind things, so could be out of reach if someone needed them.  I was very sceptical about the accessible parking from the very start, and although there is no parking at the venue, what a service!! I phoned up the accessible parking hotline and gave them the date, time, venue and event I had tickets for along with the client reference number, they done the rest. Booked me accessible parking, for this venue, it happens to be the Forge Shopping Centre 10 mins away from the venue. A map and parking permit was sent out with allocated time slot for your session. We were slightly early but seemed no problem. 5 min later we were on the next accessible minibus. I used one of the toilets outside the viewing area though still in the arena. Plenty space in them and no problems at all for a powered chair. I would advise one thing, take your ticket with you!!! Schoolboy error, almost didn't get back in without my ticket!! :-D One of the largest dedicated Blue Badge car parks I've seen in a long time. Plenty of space to transfer from the car to the wheelchair.  The parking bays are are about 100m from the main entrance. The signposting from the main road was not as clear as it couldh've been. We drove to the wrong entrance before finding out way to the accessible parking. Not too sure about public transport but there were buses running along the nearby main road. The accessible loos were good once you found them. Although they has the stick out style signs these were not always obvious from a wheelchair height. In the main concourse on the upper level there was one accessible toilet. Others were in the avenue between the upper consource and the viewing areas. These were not so obvious as you passed by. Some signage by the entrance to this avenue area would improve this greatly. Once inside the loos were fine with space to move, good grab rails and what you'd expect to find as a wheelchair user. Plenty of disabled spaces Plentiful and spacious  Really accessible parking. No drop kerb at bus stop. CG2014 venues have no on-site parking however for general use in the future thought car parking signage was insufficient. CG2014 venues have no on-site parking however for general use in the future thought car parking signage was insufficient. There are lots of accessible parking spaces, but as I attended close to the start time there were no accessible spaces left. It wasn't a problem though as the steward advised us to park in the adjacent section which was still pretty close to the entrance. There were several accessible toilets throughout the arena both near the viewing area and in the main foyer. The one I saw looked spacious and clean. Enough space for a wheelchair and a companion. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is due to there being no changing places toilet.  Plenty of disabled spaces, seemed a good, large carpark with room around each parking bay.   I only used the toilets beside the café and they were good but I accidently hit the red cord and staff came running in, ""hey guys?"". Nice and spacious toilets. "
emirates riverside stadium riverside,negative,Shocking!  There were two disabled loos in the whole ground but getting to them was not easy.
emirates riverside stadium riverside,positive,This was the best bit of the whole experience; dedicated car parking with plenty of steward assistance.  Well regimented and organised - a short walk to the ground to be undertaken.
emirates spinnaker tower portsmouth,positive,"Wheelchair got into the bathroom without issue, can't say I looked for grab rails but must of been there for me to use. I didn't notice a cord either.  No problem getting to the sink and hand dryer either. There were a few disabled spaces in the car park nearby and an easily accessible lift to take you up to ground level. Loads of parking in the adjacent Gun Wharf shopping area."
emma bridgewater factory stoke on trent,positive,"Went by car, which is probably the easiest way to get there; plenty of brown signage from the road running through Stoke. Parking on site though no dedicated disabled person's spaces as far as I could tell. Large, dedicated disabled person's toilet. Plenty of space for carer if needed.The toilet is on the left as you face it, one fixed hand rail to the right and one pull down rail to the left. A Euan's Guide label was on the emergency cord and the cord was hanging to the floor, as it should be."
emmerdale village tour leeds,negative,"Parking was easy on site. Had to use my own means of transport. There was a disabled Portaloo there but i never used it,i had a  look inside and it didn't look that good to be honest,no grab rails or raised seat so i would have struggled but others may have managed.Not very big and enough room for my carer and i."
emmerdale village tour leeds,positive,Portaloo available. All toilet facilities were portable. 
empire cinemas clydebank,positive,"The cinema shares car-parks with the rest of the shopping centre. There are marked disabled bays within each. However, the car-park nearest the cinema is often very busy, so you may need to use one of the others to find a space.  There are two train stations nearby - Clydebank and Singer (I'm not sure what access is like at them). There are lots of buses to the Centre or nearby, also a taxi rank just outside Cinema. There is one accessible toilet in the cinema. It is also a baby-changing area.  This has a fixed support to the left side,  and a moving support on the right. There is enough space for a carer to be there. "
empire cinemas poole,negative,"Well lit signage to a single disabled persons toilets. You'll need a radar key to access the toilet. There was a problem here as the photos show; someone had decided that adding a baby changing cot was a good idea. This means any slightly larger than normal wheelchair cannot manoeuvre, so you have to jump out of your chair or an for help! Unacceptable! There are also NO toilets upstatirs!!"
empire cinemas poole,positive,About 20+ unmonitored disabled bays.
enchanted forest at pitlochry pitlochry,positive,"There are 10 disabled parking spaces in the Faskally Wood area where The Enchanted Forest is hosted however, you have to phone the box office to reserve a space when you book your tickets. Due to high demand, availability of a disabled space is sometimes hard to get, once these spaces are gone they are gone.  Unfortunately, there aren’t any other disabled or non-disabled spaces nearby as Faskally Wood is 1.6 miles from Pitlochary. There is however a bus that takes guests to the Enchanted Forest from the Fishers Hotel if you have enough mobility to get on to the bus, this is available to all guests with their Enchanted Forest ticket. There is a voice of The Enchanted Forest story that you listen to whilst on the bus, which isn't available to visitors parking on site. I would maybe suggest finding another way to allow those visitors to listen to it too.  Within Pitlochary there is some on street parking and council parking available in short walking distance from where the bus would pick you up from the Fishers Hotel. If you can’t get on to the bus for the Enchanted Forest and no disabled parking spaces are available then you could possibly get a taxi to Faskally Wood by parking in Pitlochary, but I’m not sure how good the taxi services are. Alternatively, you can get to Pitlochary by bus or train, check your local bus and train station for more information. There is an accessible toilet beside the disabled parking spaces which is very spacious however, it is only a standard accessible toilet. I commented last year that there is no Changing Places toilet on site or anywhere in Pitlochary, and the organisers took that on board. This year they have hired a Mobiloo Changing Place, which is basically a van that a Changing Place toilet in it. This is a great feature to have because it makes everyone feel more included. The only problem I would say though is that it is quite hidden. Even though I was told where it was when I arrived, it maybe would have been good to have a few signposts.   There are portacabin disabled toilets on site, however even though I am unable to use these I tried to fit in and if you could transfer yourself there may be enough room. But if you need someone to help you then there would not be enough room. Like last year and the year before, there is accessible parking on site for visitors with a blue badge however, there are only a few spaces available and it is first come first serve when phoning to book a space.  This year though an accessible bus was introduced to allow more visitor with specific access requirements to visit on the same night. The bus leaves from Blair Athol Whiskey Distillery which has plenty of accessibleand standard parking available. It is a mini bus type transport with about 10 seats and one wheelchair space, although I’m not sure if more seats can be taken out of the bus to accommodate more wheelchairs.  For wheelchair user to enter the accessible bus you use a platform lift at the back. This was a better platform lift than others, and went up and down very smoothly. You can see this process in my YouTube video below. I really enjoyed taking the bus to The Enchanted Forest as it made you feel more involved in the whole event but, I was a little disappointed that they didn’t have the voice over story on the accessible bus that’s usually on the standard bus. I was told this was a technical error though so, hopefully it’s available for the rest of the month.  I’m unsure about the public transport in Pitlochry as I am not from this area but, I know that there are council car parks and onstreet parking within the town centre where you get on the standard bus at the Fisher Hotel. There are accessible portacabin toilets dotted around the trail of The Enchanted Forest beside the standard toilets. As you can imagine these are quite small and if you don’t need assistance it might be manageable but, it would be a struggle if a wheelchair user needed help. Beside the accessible bus drop off and accessible parking there is also a standard accessible toilet that is situated in Faskally Woods all the time and is much more spacious to use.  However, if you’re unable to use a standard toilet the Changing Places Mobiloo is back this year. I didn’t see the Changing Places until I was leaving as it wasn’t located in the same area as the year before, it also didn’t arrive until the end of the press night due to a mix up. I feel it wasn’t very well sign posted though but, I suppose you would see when you got off the accessible bus or parked your car."
energise york,positive,"Plenty of disabled parking near the entrance, and enough room to manoeuvre around the vehicle.  Clean, tidy, spacious and accessible toilets. "
engage edinburgh,positive,"Parking for the venue is superb. There are 8 disabled parking bays directly in front of the front door and there is also an area for drop offs. It is only a couple of minutes drive from the M8, so really easy to get to. There is an accessible loo which has everything you would look for in an accessible loo for an independent person. It might be a little tight for anyone requiring caters, but it worked perfectly for me. Signage was clear and the staff actually highlighted where the loo was on my arrival! I was very impressed by that."
engage renfrewshire paisley,positive,there are 9 accessible bays in the car parks only one accessible toilet
epic the irish emigration museum dublin,positive,I came to the Docklands by the LUAS tram system (Red Line). I am unsure about parking and buses. The city centre is about ten minutes stroll across the Liffey there are loads more transport options. There are accessible toilets throughout the museum (in every 5th room maybe) as well as at the start and end. I went into two and they were the same layout. Enough turning space for a wheelchair and companion. No need for key or swipe card access etc. 
epotx etxea getaria,positive,"Parking is next to the house with tiled surface all the way to the front door. The loo was very high. It had a drop-down rail to one side and a fixed rail on the other. Grab rails in the wet-room shower area and a freestanding but good and solid shower seat. Shower was rather high, even on it's lowest setting."
epsom downs racecourse epsom,negative,"It will be busy on Derby day, expect delays.  It’s a pleasant enough drive to reach the course, with disabled parking available at the clearly marked “gate 20” for blue badge holders, close enough to the stands.  All car parks are on the grass areas of the course., and whichever car park you use, expect a walk to get you into the stands.  There are no accessible public toilets on the racecourse, but they are available in the “Duchess stand” at each end of the main stand. And on the smaller “Queens stand” the disabled toilet are over on the right hand corner.  Don’t expect anything fancy, just use if needed, they will be clean enough, but I would hold back if possible until you reach a hotel or arrive home."
equestrian ingliston country club hotel bishopton,positive,Ample Disabled Parking
er macellaio roma,negative,We were spoiled as we had our own bus but there is limited parking available however be prepared for a walk! There is a large accessible toilet but getting to it and back to your seat is difficult.
erddig wrexham,positive,"There are 10 or so disabled parking spaces about 80 yards walk from main entrance, and one space with electric charging facilities. We've never had trouble finding a disabled space, but most of the other parking is still pretty close and easy. Public transport very limited, think you would probably need to use taxi from Wrexham town centre if not in a car."
eric vokel atocha suites madrid,positive,"The ground floor apartment comes with a private parking space with direct access to the apartment. Local transport - particularly buses - were fully accessible with ramps and two wheelchair spaces per bus.  Fully accessible bathroom with two grab rails, a shower seat and lowered sink. "
ernespie farm castle douglas,positive,"As the name suggests the venue is out in the countryside, we travelled by car, as only 30 minutes away. Plenty of car parking , with large designated disabled spaces near the door. Path to door even and flat Accessible loo, huge, plenty of room, and red cord. Plenty of grab rails, and spotlessly clean. Have marked down 1/2 star because the outside door to access the toilets is very heavy and opens outwards, although a member of staff did offer to assist me. I particularly liked that the baby changing area was separate from the accessible toilet, as it is often the case, that they share the same area ."
escape hunt leeds,positive,"In the centre of town so easy bus routes and there is parking in the Light including disabled spaces, and a lift throughout the building  Great toilet, handrails and enough space "
escaper mk milton keynes,positive,parking is outside the venue. we had no problem parking at 2pm on friday in the easter hols
escapism chester chester,positive,The accessible toilet was easy to find with plenty of room to manoeuvre and space for a carer to assist. It was neat and tidy and with grab rails and sink that was easy for wheelchair users to use.
espresso house oslo,positive,We got around by using the Metro public rail system.  Clean and lots of circulation space
espresso library cambridge,positive,"Located in fairly central Cambridge and near Anglia Ruskin university where there are bus stops.  Accessible toilet is used by all of the cafes customers (there is also one other toilet). To get the toilet you have to go through a fairly heavy door first.   The toilet itself is clean and spacious, there is transfer space to the right of the toilet and grab rails. There is also a red cord. The tiles are all black so might be more difficult for visually impaired people."
etihad stadium manchester,negative,"Plenty of them, clean and meet minimum standards, but useless for us:  little one had to lie on the floor to be changed.    But according to the Disabled Supporters Club, City are planning to install a Changing Places Toilet - which is fantastic news :) :) :)"
etihad stadium manchester,positive,"We used Metrolink.  Plenty of free spaces at the tram stop, and trams really accessible (but busy on a match day)   There are accessible bays at the club, which I think you need to book first and a shuttle bus from car park.  Lots of info on the club website or via the disabled supporters club.   There is a proper Changing Places toilet here :)  Lots of standard accessible toilets here, and (for a football ground) very clean and tidy. Access via radar key - when we got there the stewards checked we had a key, and offered to lend us one if needed.  Plenty of bays right near stadium - no issues at all (though it wasn't a match day!)"
euans guide hq edinburgh,positive,"CodeBase is easy to find at 38 Castle Terrace. If you are getting dropped off there is ample space outside for a car or taxi to pull over.   If you are taking public transport, the nearest train station is Haymarket which is around 20 mins walk away. The nearest Tram stop is Shandwick Place which is around 10 mins away. Lothian Road is just a few minutes walk away and there are multiple buses routes that have stops nearby.  There is on street parking on the streets around CodeBase although no dedicated Blue Badge spaces. The nearest Blue Badge spaces are outside the Lyceum Theatre which is about a 5 minute walk. There is paid parking in the Castle Terrace NCP which is just a couple of minutes away but this is fairly expensive! Spacious and clean!  Needs shelf, two wide doors to access loo. One from foyer, then another, grab rail, no bins, bright Nearby parking at Castle Terrace, good bus links on Lothian Road, and a taxi drop off point outside the building. There are dropped kerbs and wide pavements on the approach to CodeBase. There is an accessible loo in the corridor off of the main reception. There are more throughout the building if you are visiting a particular space, but this one is the best and most convenient! "
eugenes barber shop coatbridge,negative,There are a number of Blue badge space about 50 meters from the shop door however these do fill up quickly most of the time. The next nearest parking is in the Asda Store carpark this is a good 10 min walk away.  There is no customer toilet in store however there is an automatic type toilet across from the shop this has a ramp access and can be opened with a radar key.  
eureka the national childrens museum halifax,positive,"Car park is near the main entrance and it's only 50 metres away. The train station is next to Eureka! Bus station is not far either, it takes 10 minutes by foot. it is easy to find the toilets and you have plenty of room to move around. Lots of parking spaces. Very near the train station and only a 10 min walk to the bus station.  No problems. They have changing facilities with hoist and adjustable bed, enough room for two carers and wheelchair.  Lots of parking. Very close to Halifax train station. Not sure about bus transport. Great More disabled parking could be available nearer the facilities. Right next to a railway station, doesn’t take long from Manchester.  There is a big car park, which is flat and a 2 minute walk from the museum.  Lay-by with 3-4 accessible spaces right by the entrance.   Fantastic Changing Places Facility.  You need to ask for the code to get in, but it’s beautifully clean and well equipped.   I have 2 children under 5 and so the ""all access"" toilets are brilliant."
euskal museo bilbao basque museum bilbao,positive,"We arrived by Metro, the stop is a street away. The Metro in Bilbao is fully accessible with lifts to every station however signage to the stations was not always the best. I did find that the large gap between the metro train and the platform meant that I required a companion to help me on and off the train though so I would not be able to use it independently personally.  Toilets seemed to be available on nearly every floor."
euston station london,positive,"There's a bus station outside Euston station and a London Underground station too. I'm able to use stairs, so I don't know how accessible the platforms are for wheelchair users.  There are two accessible toilets I know of - one near platform 1, and one up near the first class lounge. Both are spacious enough, and both have red cords. There could always be more space, hence the 4-star review. I don't know if there's a changing places toilet on site. "
ev restaurant london,negative,"A perfectly good accessible toilet, one snag was that the red emergency cord had been tied up into a sort of hideous high-level contemporary macramé artwork and would not be reachable by anyone who fell to the floor. Very thoughtless, dangerous and annoying. See my photo below."
evans cycles renfrew,positive,Lots of accessible parking bay's in various car parks  around Braehead Various accessible toilets throughout the centre as well as a Pamis style toilet
evans easyspace kirkcaldy,negative,4 spaces for disabled lowered kerbs to building entrance but no ramps bus stops a good ten minutes away and limited crossings

evelix pods dornoch,positive,These pods are on the North Coast 500 route so a car or vehicle is a must There is a fully accessible wet room.
eventim apollo london,negative,"Hammersmith tube station (Piccadilly and District lines) is a five minute roll, along with local bus routes.  Parking is permit controlled but Blue Badge holders can use spaces.  I did not see any disabled spaces.  There is no car park and the area is quite busy, we've parked two minutes away in Queen Caroline Street both times we visited and found a space but there is no guarantee.  Easy place for taxi drop off or collecting from outside the venue. There is one disabled toilet on the ground floor to the left of the auditorium entrance.  I don't have a radial key, but friendly staff have one and I was escorted by a pleasant gentleman who waited at a discrete distance before escorting me back to my seat.  It was spacious, well equipped and clean enough at the beginning of the evening.  Could do with at least one more on the right of the auditorium where the disabled area is."
eventim apollo london,positive,"The good sized accessible toilet was next to the disabled area, literally fifteen feet away from us. It required a Radar key, preventing it from being abused, and was also being policed by the dedicated staff near to us."
everards meadows leicester,negative,"Toilet wise, we didn’t use one but I think  you’d need to use the ones in the brewery or the cafe."
everards meadows leicester,positive,We drove and parked on site initially we thought all the disabled spots were taken but there was more parking beyond the cafe.
everyman cinema glasgow,positive,"By National Rail  Glasgow Central Station & Glasgow Queen Street Station   By Subway  St Enoch Station & Buchanan Street Station  By Bus 1,1A,1B,1C,100,359,X4 stop @ Buchanan Bus station  There is no parking available on site, but there's public parking nearby.  There was signs directing you to the nearby toilets, there was also enough space to move about in the loo for both the stalls and the disabled toilets,  also grab rails present in the disabled loo, toilets were also well cleaned prior to use. Available space was present for carer in the toilet, changing area was located on the same floor."
everyman cinema leeds,positive,"There are lots of disabled parking spaces in the trinity car park, but the car park can be expensive (as in the middle of town) and you still need to walk across the road to get to the trinity centre. Once there there is a lift up to the second floor where the cinema is.  There is also a bus stop across the road, Next to traffic lights if taking public transport. "
everyman cinema newcastle upon tyne,negative,"Unfortunately, this was not a changing places toilet and alongside the fact that YET AGAIN the door had to be manually opened (again, heavy), it had no signage apart from an extremely small round disabled logo halfway up on the door, it was extremely small - I have a very small manual wheelchair and there is definitely no way anyone else (e.g. carer) could fit inside with me in there - and the toilet flush was at an awkward height and angle. My partner also informs me that there was also loud music playing, which could be very offputting, especially for those who are autistic. However, it was clean and there were plenty of grab bars and a red cord that hung all the way to the floor - so if you can open the door (or get someone to), it is manageable. "
everyman cinema newcastle upon tyne,positive,"I don't drive, so I don't know what the parking is like - but from a quick search, the nearest blue badge spaces are on  Hood Street. There is also good access via the metro; the monument is the nearest stop, less than one minute walk away.   As I have a disabled bus pass, I went with my partner by bus. There is a direct bus that stops very near the cinema. "
everyman cinema stratford upon avon,positive,Accessible toilet to Approved Document M standard with baby change included not separate.
everyone active poole dolphin poole,positive,"Plenty of disabled parking bays, not all are wider bays though. Accessible changing areas are large and include hoists and cot, toilet and extra seat. Plenty of space to get changed alone or with the help of a carer."
exbury gardens southampton,positive,Parking was straight forward but on gravel 
excalibur cafe glastonbury,negative,"There is only on-street parking available on the High St. which can be very busy at times, however, there is a nearby car-park with disabled spaces.  We visited in the evening so availability could vary."
excel london london,negative,The accessible loo was fine and it was well signposted - but why aren't there more?! We were there for the MS Life show and every time we went past the accessible loo there was always a substantial queue.
excel london london,positive," Public transport to get there is great! You can get the DLR (Docklands Light Railway) there - as previously mentioned there are two DLR stations one at either end of ExCel and it is really helpful to know which one to get off at before you get there. The DLR links in with the Jubilee Line - so makes for a fast and fairly easy journey from Central London. Unsure about parking at ExCel. There is a taxi drop off and taxi rank right outside the door. Accessible parking is available on site although arrangements may vary according to the event you are visiting. Customs House and Prince Regent DLR stations serve the centre and each is linked by a short bridge, with lift access, directly into the centre complex. There is a taxi drop off point at the Eastern end of the complex. There were several accessible toilets located throughout the complex. The ones I used were spacious, modern and well appointed. There is also a Changing Places Toilet at the Eastern end of the complex."
exeter community transport association exeter,positive,Free Parking on level 3 of Princeshay car park for Shopmobility.  Toilet in the Shopmobility shop.

fabios restaurant edinburgh,positive,"All good, and because it is by te Drumbrae roundabout, bus links are excellent. perfectly acceptable"
fade street social dublin 2,positive,Only bathroom is on the ground floor meaning you have to use wheelchair lift each time if you're in the bar or beer garden.
fairlie mound path fairlie largs,negative,Near to two bus stops on Fairlie main road and there is also lay-by parking available.
fairlie station largs,positive,The station is quite easy to access by car or on foot. There is plenty of disabled parking available in the station car park.
fairmont easter balrymonth,negative,The hotel staff offer to park your car for you. Manual parking is an option but disabled spaces are located quite a fair bit away from the main entrance. 
fairmont easter balrymonth,positive,"Toilet/Bathroom inside the accessible room was fantastic! It was almost like another room. Roll-in shower with guardrails and handlebars. Emergency cords were accessible. Again, the best I've ever seen. No hassle at all."
fairytale farm chipping norton,positive,"disabled parking right next to entrance, plenty of room Easily accessable disabled toilets We drove but easy to find just past the antiques store! Amble parking Very spacious and clean The car park has lots of spaces and disabled parking is right next to the main entrance.  For disabled people who can walk the disabled loo is brilliant. Unfortunately I need to lie my daughter (12 years old ) on a bed to change her with a hoist to lift her. I believe they are hoping to have a changing places installed which would be great. "
faith mission book shop glasgow,positive,As next to central station easy to get to would not recommend bringing a car as dear parking in the town  Great toilet with changing facility 
fakenham garden centre fakenham,positive,Parking is good. It’s a tarmac surface with a number of disabled / Blue Badge spaces by the entrance. There are toilets but I didn’t use them so can’t comment
falconer museum forres,positive,There is ample off street free parking with disabled bays. 
falkirk grahamston railway station falkirk,positive,"Massive car park right beside the train platform for trains heading in the Edinburgh direction (platform 1). There is another, smaller car park beside the second platform (next to the post office), but it is on a fairly steep slope. There are buses on the main road beside the station with a long ramp leading down to platform 1. The car park isn't free."
falkirk high railway station falkirk,positive,"The main car park for this station is ticketed and has around four accessible parking spaces near the station entrance. This car park is generally only of use if you are using platform one however as the step-free access to platform two is best accessed from a second free car park at a lower level in the hill on Drossie Road. Because it's free the second small car park fills up very quickly with savvy early morning commuters, but there are a few accessible parking bays which may be available. There is a well serviced taxi rank directly outside the station and one bus stop."
falkirk stadium car boot sale at new falkirk stadium falkirk,positive,"Really good parking outside the Falkirk Stadium. Very short walk to the car boo stalls. Public transport isn't as obvious. If you are selling, stewards in high-vis jackets direct you to your car parking space. They control where everyone goes, so if you need a wider parking space you can let them know as you arrive. We were selling and had to get there super early (6-6.30am) to be guaranteed a spot."
falkirk stadium grangemouth,negative,"CAR AND BUS PARKING Dedicated Car and Bus Park beside the Stadium.  No charge for Blue Badge.   However, ground surface in uneven and difficult for a Wheelchair LEAVING THE CAR PARK	 Dispersal can be quite good, especially when the Police control the exit."
falkirk stadium grangemouth,positive,"Good Access There are accessible parking spaces designated for away supporters that are directly beside the entrance to the stand. The only issue that you may encounter is a delay getting out of the carpark due to the volume of traffic on match days. Although very basic, as you would expect for a stadium toilet, they have to be one of the largest accessible toilets I have seen. Plenty of space for a large powered wheelchair and anyone that required assistance. Plenty of grab rails."
falkirk wheel tamfourhill,negative,"Within the visitors centre there is an accessible toilet which I would say is an average size, although there are a few bins in the toilet which might cause transfer problems.  I’m not sure if there is a Changing Place toilet near the Falkirk Wheel. There is a disabled toilet in the visitors centre with handrails. I have to say it is small and cramped with not a lot of room to move."
falkirk wheel tamfourhill,positive,"There are a few different car parks within the grounds of the Falkirk Wheel which are all a different distance from the visitors centre. I think there are disabled parking spaces in each car park however, right beside the the visitors centre there are about 4 disabled parking spaces. Every visitor needs to pay £3.40 to park in the car park, including visitors with a blue badge. This amount is for the whole day and if you are able too, there are also lovely nature walks beside the Falkirk Wheel.  As I’m not from this area I don’t know anything about public transport here but, I did notice there was a bus stop at the Falkirk Wheel. Lots of spaces. Near venue. Good size spaces.  Plenty of parking  Excellent parking right outside  There are plenty of disabled parking spaces available it is also possible to travel there by bus The first time I visited finding the disabled parking was awkward and I parked a distance away from the wheel. The next time there was some one to direct me to the limited parking by the wheel.  A bit tight for the chair inside. The one I used seemed to be just a larger room with hand bars and an emergency cord.  Much the same as many other ""accessible toilets 🚻""  I am not sure if they have a fully accessible toilet elsewhere. "
falkland palace garden cupar,negative,By car. Very little disabled parking close to the palace. None existent
falko haddington,positive,Unbelievable parking.  Blue badge spaces 50 meters from the front door. 
falls of lora hotel ferry,positive,"We travelled by car, and had difficulty finding exactly where the accessible entrance was due to lack of signage. Accessible car parking was located by driving up the side of the hotel, and around the back of the hotel to another car park. Plenty of parking near the public bar door, which is the accessible access to the Bistro and Hotel.No dedicated accessible parking spaces, but plenty of room. There is a main Car park at front and side of hotel, but access to hotel is up several very steep steps. There is a railway station in the village and public buses stop on the main road outside the hotel, but the many steep steps to the hotel would pose problems for those with limited mobility, railings are in situ beside the steps. The hotel is located 10 minutes from Oban Airport"
family farm bicester bp bicester,positive,Ample parking and 6 blue badge spaces.  First class. Modern and clean. Good circulation space and transfer either side. Red cord in order. 
fantasy island weymouth,positive,There is 2 car parks which charge for parking there. But there is on street parking which is free but it’s on a very steep hill so that could pose a problem for some visitors.

farmer palmers farm park poole,positive,"You need a car. 5 disabled parking spaces by the entrance. These have the best surfaces for a wheelchair that you’ll find in the whole of your visit. 2 shared with baby changing with plenty of space, though only one of them had grab rails."
farmfoods edinburgh,positive,Parking to the rear of the store in the public car park. Bus ervices are some distance but go to a wide range of locations.
faros greek restaurant lymington,positive,Very well equipped. Very clean. 
farrers bar and restaurant scarborough,positive,"I'll be honest, I don't know. I usually park at the Sea Life Centre (opposite end of the North Bay) and wheel myself round for a jolly good workout and a walk for my dog. There is parking around the Spa area, but not sure how much it costs. The accessible toilet is out through the back of the restaurant. It is lovely and big but the weirdest layout! Every pair of things that should be together are as far apart as possible. Toilet & sanitary bin nowhere close. Baby changing table and nappy bin nowhere close. Sink and drier on opposite walls. Spotlessly clean but just not well laid out. "
farringtons farm shop play barn farrington gurney,positive,Plenty of parking Accessible toilets
fashion and textile museum london,positive,"The nearest tube/ train station is London Bridge. London Bridge tube has limited step free access. From the tube/ train station take the  St Thomas Street exit, and it's a 5 minute walk. There are several buses that stop nearby. The museum is a distinctive orange building, so it stands out and easy to find. There is a ground floor accessible toilet. It is spacious and has grab rails including one by the sink. There is an emergency red cord but it had been cut and didn't reach to the floor.  Updated November 2019:  Tweet from the Museum ""shortly after @TinaWalksLondon visited us earlier in the year, we resolved the issue regarding the emergency chord in our accessible toilet - thanks again for bringing this to our attention. """
faslane peace camp helensburgh,negative,"There is a bit where you can pull in to park just outside the gate although you probably cant leave your vehicle there for long as it blocks another gate to what appears to be a vacant plot. I didn't go into the toilet but I did see it. The door seemed wide enough for most chairs. No grab rails or anything but possibly just enough space to transfer from a chair. There is a bath, but nothing to assist use. Non weight bearers might struggle to use the facilities."
fatamorgana rome,negative,"We walked to Fatamorgana, but it is on a main road and a short distance from a busier road with bus stops and tram stops."
fauldhouse partnership centre fauldhouse,negative,They had 6 or 7 disabled parking space about 35ft away from the entrance. The loo had lots of space easily enough for 1 wheelchair user and a carer. It had enough grabbing rails but wasn't especially clean.
fawsley hall hotel spa daventry,negative,"The disabled car park is around the back of hotel, some distance away from the entrance and quite a push for the carer. There are only two disabled bays available, but you may find space quite near these bays. It’s all on the level until you reach entrance into hotel, and a small step awaits you. We found a disabled toilet, on the level, but impractical for disabled person, and although spotlessly clean, it was rather difficult to use."
fe mcwilliam gallery and studio banbridge,positive,2 allocated disabled parking bays right beside entrance but plenty of other accessible parking for none wheelchair users.  Bus runs every 30mins from Banbridge town centre to outlet centre & gallery. After bus passes through outlet there is a bus stop outside gallery disembark & board at same stop. At entrance well signed with all normal facilities- grab bars etc/ doubles up for baby change room.

fennel restaurant inverurie,negative,No disabled parking near the restaurant. 
fennel restaurant inverurie,positive,The accessible loo was on ground level so easy access to the toilet and a lot of room in the toilet but it can be very hard to lock the  toilet door.
fenton house london,negative,"Don't try and park in Hampstead! The tube station has a lift, but it also has numerous steps, so it's not at all wheelchair-friendly. Golders Green station is nearby and is step-free to the platform. You could get a bus from Golders Green; or from King's Cross or Hendon Central (both totally step free), which would be a longer but easier journey. Whichever way you arrive, the approach to the house is VERY steep and you will need very strong motors or a very strong wheelchair-pusher!"
ferens art gallery hull,negative,"Due to city centre location limited disabled on-street parking very close by, with nearby off-street car parking facilities within several minutes walk. Again due to location bus and train links within close proximity. "
ferens art gallery hull,positive,"Two disabled toilets both situated on the ground floor, one located via the Studio Foyer which isn't clearly signposted, the other through the cafe which was obvious once in the seated cafe area. Both equipped with sufficient room, grab rails, emergency red cord, lowered sink with easy reach long handled tap."
fernwarme vienna,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Spittelau U-bahn station (fully accessible) is next door. A short rode on U-bahn Line 4 from the centre of Vienna. There's a Euro Key toilet in the main concourse of Spittelau U-bahn station. You need a Euro Key to access is. It is a reasonable size and has grab rails and an alarm. The Euro-Key is the continental equivalent of a Radar Key and works in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. I will post a ""review"" of how to get one later."
fernygrove farm coffee shop hawthorn hill,negative,"Not on a bus route. The car park is not made up & is rather uneven. There is no disabled parking, but it is possible to park close to the concrete approach to both the coffee & farm shops.  No disabled loo, but there are grab rails - at least in the gent's. A poorly positioned table restricts access. "
ferry meadows peterborough,positive,We park at the water sports section of the country park (Nene Park) Use postcode PE25UU. It's flat and there is an accessible cafe. It's the starting point for a walk around 3 interlocking lakes Good. Large and clean
ferry road post office edinburgh,negative,On street Blue Badge Parking. Bus stops within 100 metres.
festival theatre cafe edinburgh,positive,"The venue has one or two disabled parking spaces, there are good bus links and on street parking nearby. The toilets are spacious and clean."
festival theatre edinburgh,negative,Personally I didn't use it - although I do know it isn't the easiest to get to but it is functional and clean if a little small.
festival theatre edinburgh,positive,"Phone ahead to book a disabled parking space at the back.  I use car but should be plenty buses up and down the bridges. Decent size. Limited parking on the street although public transport is available.   However, when booking tickets, places in the side courtyard (which ha twelve or so disabled parking spaces are located) can be reserved. There are several bus stops within 50 metres of the venue. I've also heard from pals that there are a limited number of parking spaces that you can reserve in advance at the venue. Clean, tidy and very spacious. If you phone ahead to the actual theatre, you can book one of their Disabled Parking spaces in their Courtyard.  It is difficult to park outside  because it is a main road but is easier at the end of an evening show.  There is parking in side streets however. The toilets are very roomy so easily usable for both wheelchair and motorised scooter users. Plenty room also if you require a carer to assist you whilst in the toilet.  They are clean and handwashing and drying is easy to do. I arrived at the venue by public transport and that was fine as the accessible bus dropped me nearby. A friend arrived by car and was able to use the theatre's car park to be closer for their powerchair access - contact the theatre before visiting as they very helpful. There was a good sized accessible toilet on the foyer area at the Stalls level of the theatre. I loved the giant sign proclaiming the presence of the accessible toilet - it was high on the wall and easily viewable from wheelchair height, even over the heads of the crowds. The toilet was large enough and clean and tidy. At first glance parking appears difficult but there are actually some dedicated spaces that can give direct and level access straight into the theatre - simply contact the box office ahead of your visit to discuss what is helpful for you. Buses pass along the busy street outside and there a stops nearby that are served by Lothian Buses - all accessible. During my visit I tried out two of the accessible loos. Both were easy to wheel into with plenty of space to manoeuvre. They were spotlessly clean and there were grab rails and all the facilities you'd expect to find. The doors were easy to open and were wide enough to make getting in easy and were light enough so you didn't need to struggle. Plenty of room There are a few disabled spaces, private for theatre patrons only, on the left hand side of the building near the stage door. We parked round the corner in S. College Street with blue badge."
festival wheel edinburgh,positive,Public transport around this area of the city is great. Buses stop right outside the gardens and they're of the low floor wheelchair accessible type. There's a tram stop nearby at the side of the Mound and Waverley station is on a short walk away.
ffestiniog welsh highland railways porthmadog,positive,"There are three disabled spaces outside the front entrance, otherwise there's parking in the council car park nearby with plenty of blue badge spaces. There's a mainline station in Porthmadog with connections to other parts of the UK. There's an accessible toilet at the end of the platform."
fiddlers arms edinburgh,negative,On street parking but being near the city centre it is restricted. There is a good bus service that passes the door. There is an accessible toilet. The only reason I gave it 2.5 stars is because I was never there to use the facility.
fiddlers arms edinburgh,positive,Large accesible loo just beside the bar
fielding cottage norwich,positive,Its down a single track road so I was grateful not to meet anything coming the other way although there are passing spaces. Lots of parking . The car park is covered in pea shingle but quite tightly compacted and I used my mobility scooter on it quite easily.
fife airport glenrothes,negative,"Again easy to use and get to, not so easy to find."
fife airport glenrothes,positive,"Good parking facilities and plenty of space, no stairs and everything is low level access and easy to get into without a hitch."
fife college stenton campus glenrothes,positive,lowered kerbs clearly marked parking bays and they are wide enough parking bays close to entrance good clean accessible toilets
fife ice arena kirkcaldy,negative,I traveled in my car and parked in the Ice Rink car park. However the car park was very uneven and required help from an able bodied person. The loo was accessible but difficult to find.
fife shopmobility dunfermline,positive,"Dedicated Shopmobility spaces reserved in multi story car park at Kingsgate centre. Shopmobility located in shopping centre, ground floor, staff can meet you at bus station or Dial a Ride and Ring and Ride drop off.  Good standard, clean. "
fife shopmobility glenrothes,positive,"Good standard, clean."
fife shopmobility kirkcaldy,positive,"Good standard, clean."
fife voluntary action kirkcaldy,positive,"free parking with disabled spaces at the front and rear of the building. there is , at present, only one disable parking space at the rear of the building but it is less than 20 yards away from the main entrance the disable toilets are fitted with alarms, D locks, baby change units, and supports for people. most of the toilets are easily accessible with plenty room, except for one where the disabled toilet and door are fine but the doorway to access the disabled toilet is too narrow Three spaces in the car park 20 minute parking in street unlimited for blue badge holders. Well places for bus station and railway station.  Two accessible loos. One more easy accessible than the other as one has a standard 26 inch door just before you get to the wide door.  The other has a wide door. Toilet seats are not suitable for side transfer but Fife Voluntary Action Manager immediately agreed to replace them once the issue was pointed out. "
fig tree bistro edinburgh,negative,Probably best to reach via by foot. There is an accessible toilet but it is cluttered with baby chairs and it would be difficult for a good sized chair to manoeuvre around in.
filling station edinburgh,negative,It is in a pedestrianised thoroughfare however there are some but not many disabled parking bays within 50 - 100metres. The pavement is easier to move on than the cobbled street although during the festival it is difficult anywhere her on the street because of the criwds The door opens inwards so you can't close the door if you enter in a wheechair.
filling station glasgow,positive,"Disabled parking is good with plenty of spaces on the upper level,  lower level and in the multi storey."
filmhouse edinburgh,negative,"Blue badge parking available in Cambridge street by the traverse. We got in with the power chair but only just! Door frame is quite narrow. Would help a lot if door opened out. Unfortunately the Filmhouse doesn't have a parking area but public transport is regular and close to the venue. You can park outside on Lothian Road with a blue badge between 9:30 – 4:30 Mon – Fri and 8:30 to 6:30 on Sat. Parking restrictions on Lothian Road end at 6:30pm. The nearest car park is Castle Street car park, although a better option for blue badge holders would be to park beside the Usher Hall/Lyceum Theatre and then cross Lothian Road at the crossing beside Nandos. Disabled Car parking for 4 cars outside just before bus stop, but often full. However there are 3 or 4 parking spaces beside the Traverse Theatre. There are numerous buses that either stop outside or by The Caledonian Hotel or St John's Church (200m away uphill)."
filmhouse edinburgh,positive,"Very spacious. many older buildings tend to use their largest toilet and they turn to be cramped and/or inadequate but this isn't the case with Filmhouse and the toilets are very clean and well stocked with all the things you need: soap, toilet roll and hand towels. There is a big disabled toilet on the same level as the ticket booth (down the corridor to the left as you face the ticket booth) and there is a further, slightly smaller, disabled toilet on the lower level where cinema 2 and 3 are.   Loses a point as they are functional but not pretty. Spacious toilet doubling as baby change. Red cord doesn't reach the ground. The toilet may be locked and you may have to ask for staff to open it for you. One accessible, clean loo big enough for a PA to help and manoeuvring. Drop down rail by loo and grab rails round sink but not the drier. Large bins to dispose of pads etc. Buzzer cord reaches the floor. Great buses to and from Lothian Road, bus numbers 11, 12, 16, 10, are a few I can think off.  There is an accessible toilet which is good, but I forgot to take a photograph. Very good toilet but unfortunately often occupied by non disabled users who find the short walk to the ''normal'' toilets a bit onerous! Good level of Access  Recently the accessible toilet has been fixed with a code button system and you can get the code from the front desk upon arrival or later. The door is light once unlocked. I have to be careful when leaving as you come out into the small corridor that leads to the screen and if people are rushing past they will walk right into you. The signs for the toilet are clear. There are grab rails on each side, space under the sink for a wheelchair and there is a red cord that reaches the ground."
findhorn hinterland trust forres,negative,"There are disabled parking spaces available in the Findhorn Foundation Car park but it is quite a trek from there to where this event was held up forestry tracks.  Findhorn Bay Arts did get permission for us to take our car nearer to the location but there was still a fairly bumpy forestry track to negotiate slowly.  There are buses and trains to Forres from Inverness and a local bus goes  past Findhorn Foundation. The accessible toilet wasn't near the performance but there was one available in another area of the park although this is back in the centre of the Foundation park at Universal Hall.  There was a one-way system to the toilet, hand sanitisers were available  and it was clean and basic inside with grab rails, a red cord and a ramp outside.   "
fine nammet shanklin,negative,"The disabled toilet is a good size, but there are highs chairs outside which need to be all moved out if you are to get past"
finglas leisure centre dublin,positive,In front of centre. Toilet in changing room raised toilet seat with handle rail.
fingringhoe wick visitor centre colchester,negative,There is a small patch of rather rough ground next to the visitor centre which is labelled for disabled parking.
fingringhoe wick visitor centre colchester,positive,"Fairly standard accessible toilets, clean and well-maintained if a little small."
finns place glasgow,negative,There is on street parking but because it's a residential area with lots of tenements it's fairly busy. Battlefield road which is well served by a number of different buses is a couple of hundred yards away. There is an entrance to Mount Florida train station on battlefield road but this is inaccessible for wheelchairs. There is an accessible entrance to the train station but that one is quite a distance.
finns place glasgow,positive,A very large clean toilet.
fino lounge cardiff,positive, Good access in dedicated loo but no changing places .
fino wakefield,negative,"The toilets are upstairs which I didn't know before booking. There are fairly steep stairs, about one flight, but there are chairs near the top by the toilets if you can manage with difficulty but need a rest. I managed with help. The toilet I used was very small and didn't have rails but did have furniture to lean on. You wold struggle to get a carer in this one with you, but the second one was bigger.   The waiter did give me the option of using their sister restaurant Robatary's disabled toilet, which is about 5 doors down. Not ideal but an option if you wish to eat here."
firing line museum cardiff,negative,No disabled parking but City Centre location so parking available in City Car Parks and public transport nearby.
firing line museum cardiff,positive,Good provision of toilets but tend to get used by all as main public toilets tucked away.
first coast edinburgh,positive,"The restaurant has only one toilet, but that is fully accessible. Lots of close by bus links, and close to the train station. You could also park in the co-op car park for up to two hours. Blue badge holders are also able to park just outside the chest and heart charity shop which is almost directly opposite the restaurant. They have one toilet for everyone which has all the rails, lowered sink etc. Only issue is that the corridor it's on isn't the largest, Paul used it no bother not sure if a powerchair user might struggle though."
first direct arena leeds,negative,Car parking is on street but some bays are very near venue and free for blue badge holders.
first direct arena leeds,positive,"not to bad if you know Leeds great but you will need your radar key Lots of disabled loos. Unisex with radar key accessand very roomy. We walked to the venue as I live nearby, going through the Merrion Centre onto Arena way. The bus can drop you outside the Merrion centre to walk through, although it can be quite busy, and could be considered quite a distance for some. It's about 5 minutes from the Merrion centre to the entrance of the arena. (if people are staying over, there's a premier inn directly facing it) Fine for me- grab rails, red cord, lighting not too bright after coming out of a dark arena space. Might struggle if you have a PA with you, as the toilets weren't huge. It would be doable, but a bit of a squeeze."
fish company reykjavik,negative,Disabled parking spaces available on nearby streets. Plenty room to manoeuvre once inside but no grab rails. Very dark.
fisher donaldson dundee,negative,"The toilet was very small and not suitable for wheelchairs or guide dogs, and there is no red emergency cord. "
fisher donaldson dundee,positive,"On street parking right outside, a 5-10 minute walk from the train station, and city centre buses just a short walk away."
fishermans bay whitley bay,negative,"Nice and clean and fairly spacious, with grab rails. However whilst the door was nice and wide, because it swung into the bathroom (which was an unusual shape) it made it difficult to negotiate easily in a wheelchair."
fishermans bay whitley bay,positive,No parking on site but parking close by at Spanish City with free parking for disabled.
fishermanstavern hotel dundee,positive,"There are council car parks/on street parking close by and taxi rank is also nearby. There are also plenty of buses that pass through Broughty Ferry on regular basis. A train station is also situated in Broughty Ferry although I don’t know anything about how often they stop, I know it’s not that much though."
fishers farm park wisborough green,positive,"Very limited disabled parking bays.  Rest of the car park is on a mixture of surfaces (tarmac, grass, hardcore).  No changing places but disabled toilet located at most toilet blocks around the park. "
fishers hotel pitlochry,positive,"Arrived by car for a mini break . They do have a car park but we could park on the street outside the main entrance to the hotel that is marked for hotels guests only. Reception took a note of our car registration and said that was the best place for us to leave the car. We found one disabled loo not far from our hotel room which had enough room for my wheelchair and my carer to assist me. We were able to park right outside the main entrance to the hotel . In a pull in set aside for hotel guests,  reception took a note of our registration and said it was ok to leave the car there access from here was down a slope to main entrance. There was an accessible toilet down the corridor  from our room ,with plenty of room for the wheelchair  and my carer . The toilet in here is a raised one and had grab rails "
fishers in the city edinburgh,negative,Limited on-street parking available on Thistle Street. Very cobbly. High and bumpy pavements.
fishers in the city edinburgh,positive,Accessible toilets available on both ground floor and level 2.
fishionados torquay,positive,Torquay Train Station is a 10 minutes walk away and buses stop close by along the sea front.
fitz park keswick,negative,Public car park.
fitz park keswick,positive,"Parking is available at the far end of Fitz Park, just off Crosthwaite Road, in one of 2 car parks there.  Alternatively there is limited on-street parking available on Station Road near to the museum.  Alternative parking is available in one of the town centre car parks, but these are more expensive - free for blue badge holders.  The nearest train station is in Penrith. There is only one accessible loo which is clean and well maintained with grab rails.  It has enough room for me to manoeuvre my wheelchair and for a carer, but can get busy at times."
fitzrovia chapel london,positive,"The chapel is tucked away in Pearson Square, a pedestrianised area with no vehicle access. The chapel is surrounded by tall modern buildings, so you could easily miss it unless you knew it was there. There are a number of pedestrianised paths leading into the square from surrounding streets.  It is very close to Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road. The nearest accessible tube is Tottenham Court Road. Also nearby is Goodge Street, Warren Street and Oxford Circus tube station, which are not step free. There are several buses that go along Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, that stop nearby.  I found the easiest way to find it was to get a bus to Goodge Street tube station, which is on Tottenham Court Road, and then walk along Goodge Street itself. It's a level 5 minute walk to the chapel from here. Walk on the north side of the street and after you cross Cleveland Street, you will find on your right hand side, a pedestrianised path which is the entrance to Pearson Square. Sorry I forgot to take a photo of this. The chapel is in the middle of the square."
five guys edinburgh,positive,Six disabled spaces directly outside restaurant. Completely level access from car parking space to restaurant.
five guys leeds,positive,"This is in the city centre, there are a number of parking choices around. "
five guys london,negative,"The accessible toilet (you'll need your RADAR key, or staff will come and unlock it if you don't have one) is well-designed but the bin obstructs the wheelchair transfer area (see my picture below). Two stars lost for this obstruction."
five sisters zoo polbeth,negative,"It wasn't too difficult to find by car (with sat nav!) - but there didn't seem to be any public transport options. The car park was quite odd. I was expecting a row of disabled bays next to the entrance (like the other reviewers had said)... but they seemed to have covered them all in masses of plants! Thankfully we visited on a weekday, but at busy times this would have been an issue. Couldn't see a single disabled bay. "
five sisters zoo polbeth,positive,"There are disabled bays at the front of the entrance, although there are many of them, I've never struggled to get one. That may not be the case in the high season, but I've never visited then. There is also an overflow car park. There is an accessible toilet inside the zoo once you have paid. The toilet looks like a shed from the outside, but it's actually pretty spacious and clean inside. There aren't any grab rails around the toilet, which may be a problem for some people. The sink has a pedestal, which may prevent some wheelchair users from getting close enough. There is also a baby changing table in this toilet.  Plenty of parking on the day we visited close to the entrance but it might be a problem in high season."
fjaderholmarna stockholm,positive,"From Gamla Stan, old town, in the summer there are boats every hour, which depart on the hour, until quite late into the evening (check timetable). The return boats from Fjaderholmarna leave on the half hour. At both ends of the journey there is a fixed ramp down to the boat. If you look at my photo of the boat docked you will see there is no ramp between the boat and the landing stage. As the boat is in the water it bobs up and down and when I went there was some water on the floor. There are grab rails either side which helped me exit the boat, I'm not sure how easy it would be for wheelchair users. Inside there is a lot of seating and to go inside there is a door with a lip which you need to step over. There is small outdoor space on the boat and there is no seating. I managed to stand leaning on the railing while I took some photos and as the sea was calm I felt safe doing that.  The boat ride takes 25 minutes and then the boat turns around and returns to Stockholm. I saw two accessible toilets on the island. One was near Systrarna Degens and the other was further along in the block by the Forge and glass gift shops. Both toilets had ramp access. i only used the one by Systrarna Degens, see photo. It was spacious, clean and had grab rails. No emergency cord."
fjara coffee shetland,positive,This cafe bar has its own tarmac car park with 2 designated disabled parking spaces. These are near to the ramp going into the building.  The accessible toilet is in a room beside the other toilets it is well signposted it is large enough for a wheelchair & a carer if needed. There are plenty of grab rails in appropriate places. It was very clean & tidy. Hi o
fjeillheisen tromsdalen,negative,Basic. 
fjeillheisen tromsdalen,positive,"We took the service bus from Tromso. A one way ticket is 60 krone,  100 return but you can get an all day for 100. So make enquiries before buying. The bus had good wheelchair access. The is a large car park at the lift if you arrive by car b"
flamingo land malton,positive,"There are several toilet facilities. All the toilets are spacious and all have disabled facilities. However they are mainly populated around the food areas of the park. There are none, that I can recollect, around the zoo area."
flamingos coffee house leeds,negative,"I believe there was a disabled toilet at the back of the shop, but didn't need to use it so cannot provide further details. Accessible toilets including full changing places are definitely available in nearby shopping centres if necessary."
flamingos coffee house leeds,positive,"The coffee house is very close to both the train & bus station, several bus stops, taxi ranks, & numerous disabled car parking spaces. The mall is flat, smooth, & wide, so it's pretty easy to get to."
flanders moss stirling,positive,good car park - gravel but wheelchair proof netting so not a problem. Don't think public transport is an option. Great parking on a flat carpark with blue badge spaces. No public transport. A short section of path (crushed stone surface) connects the car park to the start of a circular route across the bog on a boardwalk (900 metres).
flat rock bistro cardigan,negative,The car park is small with no dedicated parking bays. On this occasion I ended up parking on the road and using my powered wheelchair. Which isn’t ideal.
flat rock bistro cardigan,positive,Reasonable toilets if a bit tight with a powered wheelchair.
flat spaces hampshire ropley,positive,"Nice paved parking, with plenty of extra parking space.  Easy to find due to very good directions. Big open space with well thought out positions of the sinks, showers and bathtub as well as the two toilets. One of witch is directly under a discrete lift-rail so that even people of extreme mobility limitations can relive themselves comfortably.  Best shower Parking for several vehicles just outside entrance to Bungalow . Clos-o-mat toilet, rise and fall sink. Very easy by car but no where near train station or bus stop. Excellent!  Grab rails, electric toilet, lots of room to manoeuvre, overhead hoist and very clean"
flatford mill colchester,positive,"You have to use a car to get there and plan well. Once you get to the end of a narrow country lane, there are two options; a lane to a discrete car park that has a number of disabled parking spaces or the top of that lane that lead to another car park space which has no disabled parking. My carer and I chose the latter option because we wanted to meet up with able bodied friends and have a picnic under the shade of the trees in that car park. Ample spaces to permit this and not charged for parking in this car park. P.s. I did not take up an additional parking space. "
flatts wood walk barnard castle,negative,"Had to park in a car park in Barnard Castle.  There were blue badge spaces almost opposite the castle but we didn't notice them til later as they were so poorly marked. There were two or three spaces there. It took us about three minutes to get from the public car park to the castle on foot - it's through the town on mostly good pavements, dropped kerbs etc. . It's downhill ever so slightly."
fleet air arm museum ilchester,positive,"Flat tarmac parking with a good amount of disabled parking bays. The museum is also accessible by public transport. This is from their website: The Museum is accesible via rail and public transport: - Visitors are advised to access mainline routes to Yeovil Pen Mill, Yeovil Junction or Castle Cary stations. A round trip from Yeovil Pen Mill station by taxi should cost around £35 - £40. We recommend that you book your return taxi in advance on the day of your visit, as the lead time for local taxis in the afternoon can vary greatly and could contribute to a lengthy delay. There are plenty of disabled access toilets through the whole museum all with good acccess. "
fleetwood beach wheelchairs fleetwood,positive,"Large car park right next to it, with accessible bays.  We used the postcode for the New Boston Hotel opposite and found it easily.  "
floibanen funicular bergen,positive,Once at the top there is very good sized accessible toilets that have push button automatic doors. 
florence nightingale museum london,negative,We walked from Waterloo Station. Leave through exit 3 and follow the signs a few blocks. No museum parking.
florence nightingale museum london,positive,"Modern, very clean (well it would be terrible if it wasn't based on the theme of the museum!!). In fact the cleaning cupboard was in the accessible toilet but there was still a decent amount of room. The emergency cord is now the proud owner of a Euan's Cord Card as it took a lot of work to untie. Four toilet roles to choose from!"
florida spa fuengirola,negative,On street parking but there is access via ramp Disabled toilets are very good
flowerfield arts centre portstewart,positive,"There is a big car park which is exclusive to the Flowerfield Arts Centre and park - it is not difficult to get parked, even on a busy day."
flughafen wien schwechat,positive,"We had arranged specialist transport - a fully wheelchair accessible vehicle - with a local firm, Haller-Mobil -  http://haller-mobil.at/ - whom we would highly recommend. On the outward journey the driver was able to park very close to the entrance to the arrivals hall and deploy the ramp easily.  Dropping off on departure was more complex - it seemed a much busier part of the airport and finding a parking space was more difficult for our excellent driver. There are several, they are well-signed, reasonably spacious and equipped with grab rails and alarms. Importantly, on departure there are accessible toilets beyond security."
flydsa arena sheffield,positive,"I purchased a disabled parking bay in advance which was posted out to me prior to my visit,the cost was £12.50 including postage which i thought was a bit on the expensive side but it was well worth i thought when i got there as the parking was only a 30 second walk to the entrance.I cannot really comment on public transport as i didn't use it but the venue is well served by public transport,but is quite along way from the train station. The toilets were Radar key operated which i always think is good as it stops able bodied people using them.The toilet itself wasn't that big and i would have struggled to turn around in it but it was equipped with the usual handles and was big enough for my wife to assist me.It was easy to find as well. We booked disabled parking for £10 along with our gig ticket. This got us into the red car park which is right at the front of the arena. It is a very short walk from the disabled parking bays to the entrance - around 30 seconds. There was quite a lot of parking bays and they weren't all taken. Very handy and extremely easy so for £10 it is worth it. "
fochabers fish bar fochabers,positive,You can park on the high street next to the fish bar.
fochabers ice cream parlour fochabers,positive,You can park on the high street right beside the Ice Cream Parlour.
fochabers library fochabers,positive,There are 3 disabled car parking spaces right outside the gym.  There is a disabled toilet which is nice and spacious.
fochabers public institute fochabers,positive,The Fochabers Institute has its own car park with a few disabled spaces.  There is a large disabled toilet available for the public to use. The toilet is quite tight but good enough.
folkestone sports centre folkestone,negative,There are only a few disabled parking spaces but free on road parking is available and there are plenty of drop kerbs for wheelchairs.
folkestone sports centre folkestone,positive,"Accessible toilet is Ok, not particularly large and entry is around a couple of corners."
folly farm kilgetty,negative,"Whilst there was ample parking for disabled badge holders, there was no lines on the car park, which meant there was no guarantee of space being kept for the wheelchair on return. Whilst there were examples of cars parked rather close to other cars, fortunately for me my space was near the edge of the car park, however had I been further into the parking, I could envisage some major problems getting back into the car.  It was a long walk from the disabled parking to the main entrance as the full length of the parking had a physical barrier, therefore you'd have to leave the disabled parking, and then double back and walk the equivalent of the full length of the car park in the opposite direction to reach the entrance gates. So whilst a car can be parked as little as 40 metres from the entrance, you would have to walk 180 metres to get from there to the entrance.  The surface of the car park is compacted gravel, whilst the wheelchair went over this okay, it isn't the easiest of surfaces for wheelchairs. The toilet was very small - so small it was impossible to get the wheelchair in and close the door. There was suggestions that the venue had a changing room toilet, but there wasn't a single sign I noticed that directed me to the toilet, the venue didn't provide any maps, and the online app was generating a 404 error for the main page and an Internal Server Error on the map page. "
folly farm kilgetty,positive,"I was newly registered disabled and hadn’t yet received my blue badge. The staff were understanding and told me to park in the disabled area anyway.   HOWEVER there is then a walk from the parking to the gates. Fine for those in a chair/scoot but with a walking aid some may find it too much.  Disable parking was as close to the main entrance as possible Multiple disabled toilets, one with a hoist and changing bench - Almost a changing places toilet. We arrived by car, the Blue Badge parking area was clearly marked and there was ample room even for the largest of vehicles. The pathways from the carpark to the reception are very good, the reception itself is also accessible and they even have their own onsite wheelchairs for any ambulant guests that might feel its too much of a walk. I only used one of the accessible toilets while there and found it perfectly ample..  "
fopp edinburgh,negative,"Two minute walk from a few bus stops from St Andrew Square, plus the tram stop. Also a few minute walk from Princess  Street and Queen Street."
fopp glasgow,negative,Not specific parking 
fopp glasgow,positive,Great public transport and Hillhend subway is only a few doors down.
fopp london,positive,"Nearby Tottenham Court Road tube station is step-free (Northern Line: street to train; Central Line; street to platform, and manual boarding ramps available), and bus routes 14, 19 and 38 will drop you outside the shop."
forage at coppice tamworth,positive,"Large car park, Four disabled bays near to entrance, with an easy push across paved pathways. Everything is on the level. Wide door to let you in, easy clean floor area, all chairs will cope well here. It had grab rails and pull cord. Thank you very much to management for thinking about disabled people. Easy parking, 4 disabled bays very close to main entrance, automatic wide sliding doors, and all on the level. Very wide door, lots of space inside toilet area, very clean, easy to spin all kinds of chairs, grab rails and pull cord. The property cares about helping disabled, and for their support we offer it 5 stars. Thank you, and well done."
forest arts centre new milton,positive,"On site and on road parking. Blue Badge space. Restaurants and take-aways close by. Station less than a mile away -  I guess. There is an accessible alarmed loo. Fine, everything I need, and clean."
forest holidays blackwood forest winchester,positive,We drove and I'm not sure how accessible public transport would be. Parking is right outside each cabin and location wise was great but the parking was on a very uneven surface which made getting out the wheelchair vehicle a bit tricky.
forest holidays thorpe forest thetford,positive,There is ample parking at The Retreat and each cabin has their own 2 car parking space. Bear in mind nothing is paved so it can get muddy in winter.
forgans st andrews,negative,As I was staying close by we just walked [wheeled] to the place. Market Street is very busy and parking is limited. There are bus stops close by. 
forres post office forres,positive,Limited parking behind the building and nearby 
forres town hall forres,positive,Plenty of off street parking with disabled bays. 
forse of nature latheron,positive,"Car is the best option, as the nearest station is at least 30 minutes away and buses are few and far between up here.  Accessible parking is just outside the entrance door."
fort augustus canal walk fort augustus,negative,"There is only a bus service to the village so you'd have to drive or get the bus.  There is a car park in the centre of the village with two disabled spaces in it.  As the car park was busy with tourists, neither were available to use but I still managed to park there after a short wait.  The car park surface was flat and even."
fort george inverness,negative,Getting to Fort George is one of those adventures where you really need your own transport. You could get a bus to the nearby village but you’d be faced with a thirty minute walk along the narrow road to get to the Fort. 
fort george inverness,positive,"Visiting with a friend I arrived by car and we were able to find a slot in the car park close enough to the entrance pathway. Not too sure how you'd get here by public transport; if you can. It was a bit off the beaten track as we seemed to pass along lots of narrow roads of the main road. Parking was fine in a large gravelled area. Toilets were in the central area of the barracks and weren't easy to find as there were loads of doors painted in the same colour - I had thought I'd end up opening the wrong one at times! The large concrete ramp with railings was a great clue that I was in the right place. Accessible toilets - a choice of two after going into the building. Toilets were to be found in several locations with the main ones in the core of the buildings. A ramp up to the door, a large lobby area and great accessible loos with plenty of space.  The Fort does have accessible toilets and these can be found in the centre of the main mass of barrack like buildings. They are on the main seaward side, northern side, of the building so it’s easy to walk along past the build row that they are in. If you do glance along the building line they are easier to spot as you will see the large concrete ramp leading up to the entrance to the accessible loos. They are sandwiched between the conventional male and female facilities which both have their own separate entrances. Opening the door at the top of the ramp you go in to a spacious lobby. Great spot to shelter from the driving rain by the way! Off the lobby are two accessible loos and a baby changing room. The loos themselves were spacious, light and well equipped."
fort kinnaird edinburgh,negative,Good disabled parking spaces available. Lots of ramps for wheelchairs. The toilets had grab rails and had good space. 
fort nelson fareham,negative,"Disabled toilets are available in multiple location and are easy to fine, with enough room to move around. They are checked on a regular basis and kept clean and tidy. They have grab rails and room for a carer.  "
forth valley sensory centre camelon,negative,Great loo but no hoist and changing table.
forth valley sensory centre camelon,positive,"Train station is a couple of minutes walk across.  a car park I drove and parked in car park, there are plenty of disabled bays to park in but I am fortunate enough to be mobile and don't need one. Train station and bus stops nearby too. There are disabled parking spaces at the entrance to the FVSC. We arrived via train at Camelon which is right across the street, less than a 2 minute walk. "
fortnum mason london,negative,Nearest tube station is Piccadilly Circus but this is not wheelchair accessible. There are plenty of buses on Piccadilly.  Nearest carpark is in Leicester Square. We parked for free in the Royal Academy opposite as we were visiting an exhibition - there are 2 BlueBadge parking spaces which you can book in advance.
fortnum mason london,positive,"Easily accessed via bus, no parking as it is central London Easy to find and plenty of space to get the scooter in and use the toilet, door is well placed too Clean and spacious with everything with reach."
forum algarve faro,positive,The disabled parking is underground on level 0. There is a row of parking spaces for the disabled which are located right next to the front entrance to the shopping centre. There is a local mini bus or a regular bus which departs from the roundabout opposite the forum Algarve.  The disabled toilet was clean and spacious ensuring that there is enough room for a wheelchair. It was sign posted well and highlighted. 
founders arms london,positive,Lots of stations / buses / piers nearby - we actually walked from our accommodation nearby...
foundry 39 edinburgh,negative,Not really sure but on a small road. 
foundry 39 edinburgh,positive,"We walked but there were buses stopping close by. When I visited the accessible toilet I noticed the emergency cord was untied and had a Euan's Guide red cord card, which I found out one of the Ambassadors had just placed. The toilet had grab rails and was clean. Had to untie red cord and add a cord card. Not space for transferring unless you could move the bin. All appropriate rails. "
fountain court apartments edinburgh,negative,The apartments are spread across several sites. Some have on site parking.
fountain court apartments edinburgh,positive,"For me, access to public transport is important and the apartments I visited were close to bus routes and easy to get a taxi.  If coming by car there are several options for parking on site."
fountain park entertainment center edinburgh,negative,1.8 meter height restriction into under ground car park free for four hours. lots of disabled  parking spaces on the lower level  lots of drop off spaces on the surface but no droped kerb
fountain park entertainment center edinburgh,positive,toilets are to small in pizza hut but reasonable in tenpin bowling
fountains abbey and studley royal   national trust ripon,negative,"There are accessible toilets at West Gate, Lakeside and the Visitor Centre. West Gate is hard to access due to the very steep slope to get to the building. Lakeside toilet access good, but you may have to queue as there is only one and it's used by visitors to the deer park too. Visitor Centre toilet good access but can be in need of a clean - again there is only one which for the number of visitors they have seems a bit sparse. "
fountains abbey and studley royal   national trust ripon,positive,"There are loos at the Visitor Centre, Lakeside cafe and near West Gate. I believe there are disabled facilities at all three however I can only vouch for Lakeside cafe as that's the one I used.  It was basic but well equipped.  It was outside the park entrance by the cafe so is also, helpfully, accessible to visitors to the deer park and cafe without needing to go into the abbey grounds. It wasn't radar key operated. Go the west gate not main entrance"
fountains learning centre york,negative,There is not an automatic door for the toilets thus there is a toilet for people with disabilities. I believe there are rails to grab on and it definitely has more space.
fountains learning centre york,positive,"the university has a small car park - car parking facilities across the road disabled toilets on every floor with lifts available Going there by a car, there are parking spots for wheelchair users and I believe the nearest bus stop is no more than 10 minutes walk."
four seasons basildon,positive,Plenty of parking and two poorly marked disabled bays near the entrance. (I parked elsewhere as the yellow paint was so faded I didn't spot them) The tarmac is quite rough and cracked. The toilet is excellent and one of the biggest I have seen.
four winds castlereagh,positive,Plenty of parking available.  On a busy bus route too. Accessible toilet was roomy enough.  Is also had a baby changing facility in it.  Clean & tidy.
fourteen locks canal centre newport,positive,Large free car park with disabled parking spaces close to the door. Side door and spacious room.
fox pelican hindhead,negative,"Small car park, making absence of disabled parking space even more important. Needs addressing! Ok grab rails. Through two very heavy doors, hard on carers back.  A bit grubby. Carer and wheelchair just fitted. Powerchair might be a tight fit."
foyles bookshop london,negative,"Several northbound bus routes will drop you off at a bus stop right outside the shop entrance. Tottenham Court Road is very nearby indeed and is step-free to train (Northern Line) and step-free to platform only, with manual boarding ramps (Central Line). "
francis crick institute london,positive,"The Crick is located next to the British Library in King's Cross. There's great public transport links. King's Cross tube station is step free and King's Cross , St Pancras and Euston Train Stations are close by. The Midland Road exit of St Pancras Station is directly opposite The Crick. The Crick is located on Midland Road, which is a one way street, with a bus stop which has south bound buses route numbers 45, 46, 63 and 214, almost directly opposite the building. The public toilets are not clearly signposted. I asked at reception and was directed to a mezzanine floor which was accessible by stairs or platform lift (this is also the route for accessing the back of the auditorium. There was a sign pointing to the toilets but it wasn't clear from the sign that the accessible toilet was also located there, so I asked a member of staff. There are double doors off a corridor, not clearly labelled, to the accessible toilet. The double doors and accessible toilet doors are manual, which is disappointing given that this is a brand new building. The accessible toilet don't require a radar key, it is spacious, there's plenty of grab rails and an emergency cord which reached to the floor."
franco manca london,negative,The disabled toilet was out of order and this was not mentioned until I needed to use the facilities.
franco manca london,positive,Located about a hundred yards from King's Cross station and King's Cross accessible tube stop.
frankfurt airport frankfurt,positive,"When I arrived at the connecting departure gate I was taken into the Lufthansa lounge to wait for boarding. It was here I visited the accessible toilet which was huge and had all the essentials.  As this was a connecting flight cannot comment on the transport, staff supportby the Airport staff was excellent. There were fully serviced and accessible areas throughout, wide spacious aisles. Wide, spacious, spotless and well serviced, can’t be faulted."
frankie bennys banbury,positive,Blue badge spaces right outside the door. Lots of other parking  Spacious and clean 
frankie bennys bury saint edmunds,negative,"There is a clear walkway to the toilet, however, this is not very wide and can make it difficult during busy periods. There are only two toilets available and these sometimes are not as clean as they could be."
frankie bennys bury saint edmunds,positive,The parking facilities available are very good considering how many venues it accommodates. Not only are there various restaurants but there is also a large cinema. The multi storey car park available alongside a designated car park is very useful but I feel that disabled parking bays could be better signposted.
frankie bennys coatbridge glasgow,positive,"as this is like a retail park, the parking is great as lots of it and lots of disabled spaces They have got a disabiled toilet its operated by a Rador Key "
frankie bennys derby,negative,Toilet had a sliding door which was of a medium weight. There were 3 bins in this toilet and a baby changing table.  Grab rails around toilet and sink. Enough floor space to turn but a large bin in transfer space (which was to the left --->). Lowered mirror and bag hook. Would struggle to fit two people and a wheelchair in. 
frankie bennys edinburgh,positive,"The layout of the restaurant and atmosphere made it a pleasant venue for a meal although I did not use it, there is an accessible toilet in the restaurant."
frankie bennys kirkcaldy,positive,"It's okay. There is disabled parking at the front of the restaurant. It's big and clear and there is dropped curbs. The disabled toilet is clean, tidy and spacious. Its a bit bright, but they have an emergency cord. "
frankie bennys poole,negative,"Adequate parking facilities. Three designated spaces, but chevrons only to one side of each bay, and the markings are badly faded. Due to the location the car park is not flat and some may struggle to push across the car park to get to the building."
frankie bennys royal leamington spa,positive,"2 Disabled spaces opposite entrance, cross access road to reach door. Wide door, large room fully equipped. Room to maneuver and transfer from a wheelchair. Fixed and fold down rails."
frankie bennys sixfields,positive,"2 Disabled spaces directly outside. Very large full equipped disabled toilet with fixed and fold down rails, room for wheelchair and to transfer. Wide door."
frankie bennys stirling,negative,There is park outside the cinema around the corner with lots of disabled spaces. Ok if you're on a scooter or wheelchair but a long walk if you're using sticks.
frankie bennys stirling,positive,Toilet was great with all rails and free red cord but I couldn't get the sliding door to fully close or lock. I mentioned it to staff and they went off to check it while we were leaving.
frankie bennys york,negative,"I just assumed there was an accessible toilet with the other toilets - there was probably a sign too, but I didn’t see it. Difficult to manoeuvre from the restaurant to the toilet due to tight corners and two doors to open. Not a huge room but adequate for my compact mobility scooter. Grab rails present, clean and tidy. (I had a ‘red cord’ card ready but there was already one there!). I like the Italian grammar lessons on tape in the toilet! "
frankie bennys york,positive,"Situated within a large car park which is shared with a cinema and other restaurants. There is plenty of free parking and disabled parking outside the front of the building close to the entrance. 3 disabled parking spaced directly in front of restaurant with plenty of space Female, Male and Disabled toilet facilities are available. Disabled toilets have a slide door while the male/female toilets have a push/pull door. All facilities are spacious and easily accessed. At this time of day, there was no problem parking in the huge carpark right outside the entrance. Just outside the entrance was a dropped curb with a bit of a lip ie not completely flush with the ground. There was a door to tackle/open - but it was not heavy. Once inside, it is obvious that you need to find a table where your ‘wheels’ wouldn’t be in the way! "
franks cafe at bold tendencies london,negative,"I rolled there as its only 15 minutes from my house. There were quite a few kerbs without kerb-drops and lots of uneven round when coming in through the back via the carpark near Morrisons. I believe their might be blue-badge parking there though if you did have a car. Closest bus stop is right around the corner.  There is an accessible toilet on the roof top but it is not signed and if coming to it from the lower level of the rooftop, the ramp is almost impossible without someone pushing hard. There was a railing to stop other people entering the accessible toilet which also prevented me from getting in without a friend to open it. Once along the flat wooden corridor you need to use a knife to open the toilet door, because they lock it like that from the outside.    The stall itself was very large with space for a carer but only one grab rail. They had a read cord that was properly installed however. No sink in the stall so you have to roll back down the very steep ramp to wash your hands. All the toilets are compost toilets so it has a very DIY feel to it."
frans hals museum haarlem,positive,"Excellent. Spacious, well-equipped with grab rails. Side transfer from either side of the loo is possible and the toilet roll holder is within easy reach. There’s an "
freemans quay leisure centre durham,positive,"There is disabled parking 30 meters from the entrance of the building. There is also additional parking 50 meters in front of the building, this car park also has disabled parking bays. There is a multi story Car park about 30 meters to the left of the building with lifts taking you to the city centre and a range of restaurants above. There is a bus stop above the car park in the city centre which is easy to access with no stairs or steps to climb.  There is two disabled toilets on the ground floor and two located in the gym changing area with an additional two toliets in the swimming pool changing area. Two of the toilets by reception were equipped with a changing bed, a shower area and every disabled toilet had a range of grab rails. There was plenty of room to manoeuvre around the toilet area, it was clean and fit for purpose. "
freemantle and shirley community centre southampton,positive,"with it's own car park and dedicated disabled bays parking is fairly easy, on top of this, it is only a very short distance from public transport if a certain lager company made toilets .......... it would be the best toilet in the world"
freeport fleetwood fleetwood,positive,The parking is divided up in to areas however each are has number of Blue Badge Spaces available these are nearest to the main gates in to the shopping area.  We used the tram from Blackpool to travel through the tram lets you off at Fisherman's Walk this is a good ten minutes away from Freeport.  The number 1 Bus runs from the gate of Freeport to St Anne's and goes along the sea front on Blackpool we used this to return to Blackpool all buses on this service were low floor access Two toilets one at each end of the site the first one is as you enter the site is on the right hand side the second is at the far end of the site both were clean and grip rails available.
french quarter new orleans,negative,I only used a toilet in a restaurant and didn't notice public toilets. 
french quarter new orleans,positive,I parked outside the city centre and got a trolley bus to the waterside. The trolley bus has a lift and very friendly and helpful drivers. 
freshwater bay freshwater,positive,"Car park just opposite, free for blue badge holders for up to 8 hours. You do have to cross the road, which might have felt slightly hairy if I wasn't in a group. Now, I must admit that I didn't use the loo, however there were signs to an accessible loo near the beach...."
friargate quaker meeting house york,negative,"There is no parking available directly outside the building.   It is possible to drive up Friargate to drop a person off outside the entrance, then turn left up Castlegate , go left down Clifford Street and up Tower Street to Castle Car Park. This charges £2.50/hour.  Someone can then drive up Castlegate from the car park and go down Friargate to pick someone up outside the entrance.

The doorways are a little narrow. There are two doors to go through. One was open when I saw it, but if it was closed it would require opening. The second door is a sliding door. Neither are wide. The room itself was a little small, so it may be difficult is using a wheelchair or if carer support is required. There was a raised toilet seat and two folding support rails beside the toilet. A wall-mounted handrail next to the sink had a towel hanging on it. There was an alarm cord. The room was clean and tidy enough, but could have been better. "
friars walk newport,positive,"Accessible parking on ground level. Can get busy on the weekend. There are toilets by the car park by Debenhams, in Debenhams there are ample disabled loos. Or the cafes have toilets. "
fringe box office and shop edinburgh,negative,Not a great score but that to do with the area being pedestrianised for the festival so limited vehicle and bus access. 
fringe box office and shop edinburgh,positive,"Not really relevant for the booking process itself, however when planning for our trip was pleased to see there will be 5 Changing Places toilets in central Edinburgh during the Fringe.  A map of where these will be is shown in the Fringe book and online. The fringe shop does not have any toilets but we give it four stars because for the duration of the fringe there will be a mobile changing places toilets available. The programme was also good at highlighting what venues have accessible toilets as well as the locations of changing places toilets."
frisky edinburgh,negative,Not good for parking as it's at a busy junction.
frites 33 derby,negative,Nearest bus station is Derby Bus Station. There is no parking out front. 
frizzante proseccheria edinburgh,positive,"It's round the corner from Euan's Guide HQ, very near a bus stop and about a 10 minute walk from the tram (so I have been told)."
fruitmarket gallery edinburgh,positive,Very large toilet with room for two carers. Door is touch button operated. Red cord had been cut or snapped half way down the wall so would be unreachable. A fairly spacious accessible loo is adjacent to the lift area. It has space to manoeuvre and is clean and tidy.
fuckoffee london,positive,"The nearest train and tube station is London Bridge, which has limited step free access. From London Bridge tube or train station exit at St Thomas Street and café is about 5 minutes walk away. There are several buses that stop close by."
fullers mill garden bury saint edmunds,positive,"Level access, designated spaces right next to the entrance."
funky scottish anstruther,negative,There is limited disabled parking accross the road from the cafe.
fusciardi ice cream parlour eastbourne,positive," Fusciardi's is on the sea front, a short walk from the Pier. There are local buses that stop nearby."
fusion organic cafe sheffield,negative,Accessible Loo :) but not changing places :(
fusion organic cafe sheffield,positive,"Bus and Tram  Near to the city centre, the Academy of Makers is close to city centre bus and tram stops and the Arundel Gate Bus Interchange.  Rail  From Sheffield train station the Academy of Makers can be is located off Howard Street which is a pedestrian street opposite. Arundel Street is a left turn off Howard Street.  Parking  The Academy of Makers is near to the NCP car park on Arundel Gate. There is limited on street parking available on Arundel Street. "
future inn cardiff hotel cardiff,positive,"There are plenty of parking spaces with about 4 directly outside of the hotel. Parking is free. There are buses into the centre of Cardiff at Cardiff Bay, including the sightseeing hop on\off bus,  at Cardiff bay, which have wheelchair access. There are also boat trips and a water taxi some of which have wheelchair access. Didn't use the loo downstairs"
fyvie castle turriff,positive,"There is plenty of parking, the sign for disabled parking sends your right outside the castle, but those spaces are on thick gravel so not easy to wheel through. We stick to the main car park, plenty of spaces. Public transport isn’t great in this area! Disabled toilet in walled garden - large toilet but not a changing place just regular toilet. "
g live guildford,positive,"4 parking bays in the surface car park  - and several spaces in the multi-story next to the venue.  All easy access for the venue. 4 accessible toilets - 2 upstairs, 2 downstairs - one extra large one on each floor.  Slight negative is that these also have baby-changing units in and we feel for various reasons that it would be better to separate facilities for babies and the disabled where possible. Toilets are also sadly often abused by the able-bodied too lazy to wait or walk a few yards.  A Radar key system would have stopped this. Loos plentiful and on all levels. Clean , spacious, well equipped."
gainsborough old hall gainsborough,positive,Ususally plenty of street parking outside Hall but there are several car parks nearby as well. If you arrive by bus or train it is a short trek to the Hall near the riverfront.
gala bingo glasgow,positive,"Buses to door, taxi rank, lots of parking and blue badge bays.  Radar key access. Good circulation space   Transfer from right. Red cord to standard. "
galashiels railway station galashiels,positive,"Obviously as a railway station there are train services. For people travelling using other modes of transport there are several options. The adjacent 'Interchange' is a transport hub and buses arrive and depart from here to numerous locations. There is also a large car park with plenty of accessible parking spaces. Toiets were very good. Accessible toilet with RADAR lock adjacent to the Interchange's seating area. The icing on the cake was the Changing Places toilet a short distance from the standard accessible toilet. All toilets were spotlessly clean, modern, well equipped,  right and spacious."
galgorm resort spa ballymena,positive,"The hotel is not accessible through public transport. The parking for the wedding venues is a walking distance from the closest disabled parking space. The main hotel has disability parking beside the main entrance, however these are often busy. The hotel offers a valet service if a guest requires to be left at the main entrance. Toilets are accessible in all areas of the hotel, however a number of the doors are very heavy and a number of people could struggle with this when trying to gain access."
gallery 48 dundee,negative,"I was there for a birthday celebration so a big table was booked and it was in the lower level. We told the restaurant a wheelchair user was part of the party and they were ready for this, however the accessible toilet was on the other level. We managed to get into the bathroom but it was very tiny and I wouldn’t have got in in my powerchair. The cubicles were too small to close the door so my friend had to block the door to the toilets so no one walked in.   I visited the restaurant about a year ago and was at the other level and used the ‘accessible’ toilet which was full of chairs and stock which staff had to clear so I could get in. However I can’t say how it is now."
gallery 48 dundee,positive,The restaurant is in town so a central location for buses and trains. There is a council car park a few mins away and on street parking nearby 
gallery of modern art goma glasgow,negative,Not very big at all (see pics). In fine condition and no RADAR key required. There were red cords in both hanging low and already had Euan’s Guide cards on :)
gallery of modern art goma glasgow,positive,An accessible toilet was available on the lower floor. Not the easiest to find. There was an accessible toilet which included a baby changing table. It was spacious enough to manoeuvre or for a carer to be in there and there was hand rails. Could have been slightly cleaner was the only criticism. Being in the centre of Glasgow there were plenty of buses to choose from. Taxis were in abundance and it was a short walk to both Glasgow Queen Street and Glasgow Central railway stations.
galloway lodge gatehouse of fleet,positive,Clearly marked Blue Badge parking with step free access into the Galloway Lodge
galvin brasserie de luxe edinburgh,positive,EASY BY TAXI. SINGLE YELLOW LINES ALLOW PARKING WITH BLUE BADGE

galway cathedral galway,positive,There were multiple disabled car parking spaces located nearest to the several entrances. 
gamla stan stockholm,positive,"Gamla Stan has it's own metro stop, which is step free with lifts. There are several buses, trams and even ferry boats that stop close by.  Opposite the cafe at 45 Osterlanggaton, was a public accessible toilet. As i walked by I saw the door was open and the toilet had grab rails."
gannet guga edinburgh,negative,Taxi can stop right outside. Parking available right along Market Street (if you can get a space). Close to Waverley Station - not sure where the nearest bus stop would be though.
garden of the people corfu,positive,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced.
garden wise plant and garden centre dumfries,positive,"The disabled parking is quite good, however, they don't have that many spaces for disabled access They have one disabled toilet I went by wheelchair taxi, but ample parking and several  dedicated accessible parking spaces near the door The centre is on the main bus route to Dumfries Infirmary  13 spaces right next to the doors"
gare du sud nice,positive,"The building is opposite the Liberation tram stop on Line 1, which provides step free public transport to Gare Du Sud. There are also buses that stop nearby. There was an accessible toilet cubicle in the ladies toilets. It was spacious and clean. There was a single grab rail and a small sink. The men's toilets I think also have an accessible toilet inside.   It was wonderful having an accessible toilet where I ate. It meant I didn't have to rush back to my hotel in case I needed the toilet, instead I could take my time and relax."
garrison house isle of cumbrae,negative,Plenty of parking along the sea front.  Bus from ferry terminal to the town of Millport
garrison house isle of cumbrae,positive,Excellent disabled toilet

garwnant visitor centre llwyn on,positive,Plenty of disabled parking spaces close to cafe. Largest disabled loo ever encountered!  Changing places toilet with large changing table and accessible baby change table. Ceiling hoist over table and toilet.  Adjustable height sink.  Toilet with integrated washing and drying.
gastro london,negative,"There are no step-free stations in the area, and parking is difficult. Quite a lot of buses serve the area immediately around the restaurant."
gate church international dundee,negative,"There is an accessible toilet just as you come in. I was told they are working to get this up to code (it does not have a red cord/ alarm and is quite small) and are in talks to knock it in and build a bigger toilet at the other end of the hall. You’d need to move the nappy bin under the sink to transfer, there were some grab rails and the sink was at a good height. There is not really space for a wheelchair and a carer and no turning space. I look forward to seeing this updated.  In the coffee bar which is currently not ideal for wheelchair access they have a new disabled toilet. "
gatwick airport horley,negative,"Everything at Gatwick is far. Very, very far! Buses to transfer to parking or to hotels are a long, long way, we passed signs saying ""8 more minutes from here"" when getting to the transfer bus areas. It was lightly uphill on a tarmac surface, just a very, very long way! The transfer shuttle to the South Terminal was accessible, though, so if parking at the other terminal is easier, the transfer over to the North terminal is quick and easy. "
gatwick airport horley,positive,"Lots of large wheelchair friendly disabled toilets including two Changing Places toilets one in each terminal.  All disabilities are covered at the airport it even has Changing Places toilets. Bring your own sling if using Changing Places toilet. There is a park and ride system that was excellent, the bus was accessible and the driver did everything he could to help.  Clean, accessible and obvious signposted, there was enough toilet paper and hand wipes. "
gatwick airport london,positive,"I arrived by train from London St Pancras. My train had been cancelled but I only had a short wait until the next one. The train goes into the South terminal. Adjecent to the Special Assistant lounges there are spacious accessible toilets, with grab rails and low level, long bar to press for assistance, see photo . The accessible toilet by the SA lounge just after airport security is huge, see photos, but sadly has not been turned into a Changing Places toilet.  I mentioned this to staff and they said that there is a Changing Places toilet but it is in Arrivals. They don't have one in Departures. Therefore if someone needs to use the Changing Places toilet they have to be escorted by staff through to the Arrivals area. I used Thames link then the shuttle. It could not be easier.  As a ramp is required at St Pancras only I do book assistance. Good. Attended toilets at the stations. Plenty of clean disabled loos at Gatwick. There is a train station but it stops by the South Terminal and those who want to travel to the North Terminal take a short ride on the shuttle which connects the two terminals.  I know they have them but I didn't use them on this occasion. I travelled to the airport by taxi as I had luggage. There is a train station but it stops by the South Terminal and those who want to travel to the North Terminal take a short ride on the shuttle which connects the two terminals. On the way back (15 March) I went home using public transport. Special assistance offered to arrange for transport to take me to the rail station but I said I would use the shuttle. The shuttle was quite busy, there is only a few seats and I had to stand. It was then a short walk to the train station. The train journey was fine and took me back into central London quickly. There were plenty of disabled accessible toilets.  They were spacious, with grab rails and emergency alarm.  UPDATED FROM DECEMBER 2018:  On my recent visit the new accessible toilet immediately adjacent to the special assistance seating area is open. The room is spacious, with grab rails and emergency alarm, which didn't reach to the floor. It is a disappointing that when Gatwick Airport put in these excellent new facilities, they didn't create a Changing Places toilet."
gaucho edinburgh,positive,Due to the Hogmanay celebrations in Edinburgh the streets surrounding the restaurant were closed off. This meant that we had to park quite a distance away from the restaurant. Normally you can park just outside the restaurant if you have a disabled blue badge. There are plenty of bus stops in close proximity to the restaurant and Waverley train station is also nearby. Another option is of course the Edinburgh tram which is also very close. 
gays creamery dawlish,positive,"Gay's is a couple of minutes, level walk from Dawlish train station. The nearest station is Dawlish train station. There is step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station. There are step free, local buses that stop close by."
geek retreat leeds,negative,"The accessible toilet is upstairs along with all the other toilets, and is accessible by the lift. I have never used it (hence the 2.5 rating), but I imagine it doesn’t have full changing facilities."
geist copenhagen,negative,"On a main road with no obvious parking and heavy traffic: travelled there on foot with wheelchair. No knowledge of public transport but certainly a number of buses going passed. Unlike many other Copenhagen restaurants this restaurant has a disabled toilet. It is pretty cramped, and hidden away behind the bar. You need to ask for access as it's clearly the staff toilet but does have some grab rails"
gemeentemuseum the hague,positive,"Can't comment on the disabled parking. Bus number 24 got us there from the city centre. Buses are wheelchair accessible. You need to buy a chipkaart in advance, and tap it on a machine both after boarding the bus and before leaving.  We were helped on by enthusiastic fellow passengers, and helped off in the same way - so quickly that the Accompanist almost forgot to tap the chipkaarts out. You enter the bus by the middle doors. There appeared to be a ramp, but the driver evidently saw that we were being helped and decided not to deploy.  Tram number 16 also runs from the city centre to the museum, but don't be fooled by the caption on Google Maps which says that the tram stop at the museum is wheelchair accessible. The tram stop may be, but the trams using this route are not! For the record, trams numbered 1, 6, 12 and 16 are NOT wheelchair accessible, though the good news is that the route taken by tram number 1 is being modernised so that, at some point in the future, wheelchair accessible trams will run on it. This route can take you from the city centre to the seaside resort of Scheveningen (Holland's answer to Blackpool) or, in the opposite direction to the neighbouring city of Delft. The wheelchair loo (not a changing places loo) is in the basement and is well-signed, though you have to go through a relatively narrow archway to get to the lift, and the people queueing up for the ladies loo were slow to move aside and let us through.  The wheelchair loo has an automatic door operated with large, easy to use touchplates on the outside and on the inside. There are grab rails on both sides of the loo, and room for side transfer. There is an approachable sink, and the usual excellent Dutch round the room at skirting board level alarm cord. "
geneva international airport le grand saconnex,positive,Very good
genting arena birmingham,positive,Have to get a key from member of staff but toilets are huge.
geographic bar xabia,positive,"Not accessible parking right outside but several spaces are within reach behind all of the restaurants on El Arenal. There are also parking and either end of the promenade. The disabled toilet at Geographic is located at the rear of the restaurant, through the left of the two doors and labelled ladies I’m afraid. It is spacious, however."
george and falcon warnford,positive,Large flat car park with two wheelchair bays by front door
george iv bar edinburgh,negative,Taxi can drop off right outside. Buses on George IV Bridge.
george iv bar edinburgh,positive,"The loos are through a quite heavy door, but generally a member of staff appears in a flash, seemingly from out of nowhere, to open it for you. There's gents, a ladies and a separate accessible loo. The door to the accessible loo is slightly awkward to open if you're on your own (because it's so big - you have to reverse for miles!), but there's generally someone around to help. Loads of room inside. It's always been clean when I've been there."
george square christmas market glasgow,negative,"Temporary single cubicle, limited provision."
george square christmas market glasgow,positive,"Being in the central area of Glasgow  serviced by bus various, taxis at Queen Street and Central Railway Stations and there is parking provion with disabled bays. Queen Street Railway  is Station is 3 mins from the Square 30m and the underground, Central Station 10 mins and 550m."
george square glasgow,negative,There are bus stops to various places on either side of the square and it's not a great distance from Queen Street station.
georges tradition nottingham,negative,I walked as it is only a minute away from West Park Leisure Centre.   There was no disabled parking in the car park. 
gerichtslaube berlin,negative,"in the cobbled area around St Nicholas and accessibility pretty limited via cobbled streets; parking difficult I would think, but taxi can get you close by didn't get directed to, nor could I find, a disabled toilet. Ordinary toilets not huge and with heavy doors to access, plus across the other side of the ground floor of the restaurant from outside seating area"
get cycling york,positive,"We drove, though there are nearby bustops. Blue badge parking was in the carpark outside the shop."
getting better together ltd shotts,positive,They can provide community transport with busses with a tail lift.  There is a ramp to get into the building and suitable toilets.   Easy disabled parking is available. 
ghyll head outdoor centre windermere,positive,Parking is right next to the bungalow entrance. Full wet room and accessible toilet with rails.
ghyll manor hotel restaurant horsham,negative,"We drove. No accessible parking. If you can park by reception, it's reasonably level.  Other parking is a lot further from reception, though there's plenty of it. Clean. Loo very low. Well positioned grab rails.  However, easily 90 metres away, via outside bumpy path for most part.  Is locked usually as is in their boardroom suite. Not huge though got my wheelchair in it. No space for lateral transfer."
giants causeway visitor centre bushmills,negative,"When we recently visited the Giant's Causeway, an alarm in the visitors' centre accessible toilet had been activated. A member of staff carefully knocked on the door, then let himself in. The room was vacant, so he deactivated the alarm, and then tied the emergency cord neatly out of the way so it wouldn't be accidentally pulled again.  The facilities appear to be excellent, but they can't be used properly if staff don't know how to maintain them.  The room wasn't particularly large, so I don't think it would be much use to anyone in a motorised chair, and might be a struggle for someone using smaller mobility aids.  I didn't see a Changing Places style accessible bathroom, but my party didn't need one so I wasn't particularly looking."
giants causeway visitor centre bushmills,positive,"There were several blue badge parking spaces available and the National Trust car park seemed quite big overall, but do book ahead, unlike us! Maybe NT places will ease up on the advance booking when the pandemic is over, but it's really worth checking. Clean, big, modern, good rails, didn't have to wait. There is a great accessible toilet in the visitor centre. Lots of turning space, roll under sink and handrails where needed so I could use the space independently.  Easily accessible car park with many disabled parking bays. Car park all on ground level and easy access to the visitor centre."
gielgud theatre london,positive,I got a taxi from Waterloo. A little pricey but they drop you right outside. There is a large accessible toilet which is kept locked and only available for disabled patrons. The toilet is in the foyer which is quite difficult to get to through the crowds but our dedicated access attendant (Elizabeth) ensured people moved out of the way and unlocked the toilet before the show and during the interval. She also waited and guided us back to our seating area.
gilded balloon teviot edinburgh,negative,We had to park quite a distance away which meant walk through busy crowds which I found difficult due to sensory issues. The toilet was a distance from the show and required going through very busy crowds which was difficult for me.
gilded balloon teviot edinburgh,positive,I got a bus from Glasgow Buchanan street into Edinburgh city centre and walked to my venues.
gillian lynne theatre london,negative,"The venue is in the middle of London's West End, so driving and parking would be difficult.  There are various public transport options; buses, taxis, underground (the nearest is Covent Garden) but it would depend upon your individual needs which would be most suitable. As it's in the West End, driving is a bit of a non starter. Nearest stepfree tube is quite a way. We walked/wheeled from Waterloo which was a good 25 minutes."
gillian lynne theatre london,positive,Loo was great. Locked to prevent misuse but staff always nearby. Well equipped. Only issue is very tight to get to door as located in narrow passage by ladies loo. Access host ensured queue for ladies let me pass.
giraffe london,positive,Close to Westminster tube station and buses at Waterloo  This venue is right on London's Southbank - so very close to Waterloo station.
giraffe norwich,positive,"We used the nearby Chapelfield car park which has very good access. The doors are a little heavy still, but a decent sized toilet."
girvans inverness,positive,"you can park in thetnearby Eastgate shopping centre or Morrison's car park. there is no on-street parking nearby, although it is near-ish the bus & train stations. Disabled toilet is in the lower area and was clean and pleasant."
gite pech de durand villeneuve sur lot,positive,Plenty of parking available. With board walk from gravel driveway to the house. Open plan bedroom and shower room. 
gladstones library hawarden,positive,"I travelled by public transport to Gladstone's and it was easy, cheap and accessible. I travelled by train to Chester. Opposite Chester's train station there is a bus stop S4, next to the Town Crier public house, and from there the 4 and x4 buses to Mold depart and take you to Hawarden.  Buses have one entrance/ exit with a ramp and wheelchair spaces. Buses are about every 30 minutes during the day. I didn't find the service 100% reliable, as the 2pm didn't turn up when I was travelling there and I ended up getting the next bus about 20-30 minutes later. There is a shelter and seating at the bus stop so it was ok. The journey took about 30-40 minutes and the bus driver was helpful and told me when I reached my stop, which is the Glynne Arms. From there it's a five minutes level walk to the Library. On the way back I left earlier to ensure if a bus was cancelled I would catch my train. Again a bus came 20 minutes after I had expected one, and waiting at the bus stop directly outside the Glynne Arms was difficult as there is no seating or shelter. The pub has a low wall, but I would not have been able to get up again. Public transport is a good option but just allow yourself plenty of time to travel in case buses don't turn up as planned.  There is a car park for guests. There are 2 bedrooms with accessible bathrooms. In the ground floor communal space there are 2 accessible toilets. Both have the emergency red cord and grab rails. When I visited one of the emergency cords were not working and there was a sign on the door, advising people to go to the other accessible toilet if required. This cord also didn't reach to the ground. I informed staff and they were going to arrange to replace the cord."
glam nail bar edinburgh,negative,Not accessible and teeny weeny! But it's on the flat.
glam nail bar edinburgh,positive,Parking available on Albert Place and surrounding streets - if you're lucky. Plenty of buses on Leith Walk (city-bound stop right outside) and a taxi can drop off outside.
glamis castle forfar,positive,"I went by car to Glamis Castle and staff were on hand to direct us on where to go as we approached the castle, although we didn’t park exactly where the disabled parking was as no one was close to it to direct us to it and we just parked where we thought it was. The car park spaces aren’t outlined though so I feel parking at the disabled spaces wouldn’t be much different, you’d just be closer to the entrance. The ground surface of the car park is graveled and I actually feel the stone surface was thicker at the disabled parking area and harder to drive over.  I’m not from this area so I cannot comment on the public transport near Glamis Castle. There is a separate car park for visitors with a blue badge which is located behind the movie screen. When we arrived staff directed us to where the blue badge parking but said my parents where able to help me out of the car beside the cinema screen so I didn't have to drive my wheelchair so far to our space on the grass. The ground of the car park area is covered in small stones but is manageable to drive in a wheelchair."
glampotel dundas castle south queensferry,negative,"The en-suite bathroom was directly off from the bedroom area. Again I was very surprised by how spacious it was. I imagined it would be very small considering it is outside, but it was a nice surprise to see it had a hot water shower, sink and eco-friendly toilet. There was also towels and biodegradable toiletries. I felt the toilet was a little too high for me and I struggled to keep my balance due to the height. A pull-down grab rail was positioned next to the toilet, but I think having one on the other side would help give more support. There is a fixed grab bar but it is on the wall behind the toilet so it was out of reach."
glampotel dundas castle south queensferry,positive,There is a parking bay next to the accessible canvas cottage (tent). This provides immediate access to the tent via the wooden ramp. The parking bay area is covered in gravel which was manageable with support in my powerchair but I’d imagine some people may find it difficult.  
glas denbury music and arts festival denbury,positive,Drop off zone available and near by parking available  This space was accessible And clean on the occasion we used it. 
glasgow 2018 european championships at george square glasgow,negative,"There was some parking but it was a good distance from the places where I wanted to go to. So I traveled by public transport , but the nearest place I was to George Square was about half a mile away. "
glasgow airport glasgow,negative,"The transport options are fairly good. There is a phone at the drop off area to the assistance people so you can request assistance immediately from the drop off point if needed. There are also a lot of wheelchair airport taxis out the front too.  It was fantastic to see a changing place toilet near the check in desks. Unfortunately it was quite hard to find and I had to be shown where to go so much signage would be great. When I went in it was pretty dirty and could have done with a clean, which isn’t great during Covid either. The other disabled toilets varied with some being too small for a power chair and no turning space, however if you’re able to travel within the airport then there are some better ones available with a lot more space in the newer refurbished areas. "
glasgow airport glasgow,positive,"We didn't use the parking so can't comment on the parking.  We have used both taxi (wheelchair accessible vehicle ""WAV"") and the 500 bus to get into Glasgow City Center both very power wheelchair friendly. Both available outside the main entrance.  This was the biggest improvement for me to see a new Changing Places Toilet at the airport. The beauty about the new toilet, it's situated just inside the main entrance door so visitors meeting friends or family can use it too. "
glasgow airport paisley,negative,"The toilet we went into just to empty my leg bag before we got on the flight was very small. The toilet was very easy to find but with a power chair like mine the room was very small. The toilet had all the correct items a disabled toilet needs and very clean, but for a person like me who needs hoisting all the time I would not be able to sit on the toilet if needed. I have no idea if the airport has a hoist in any toilet or a Changing Places toilet.  I found this description a joke, as although there were many drop off spaces, you were nowhere near the entrance of the airport. Would have been easier to come in a taxi as it appeared they could get much nearer. All that walking with a stick and a suitcase on wheels (and as usual it was raining ++) We parked at NCP long stay (nearest the airport) and had to get bus etc. The disabled toilets in the departure lounge are accessed through a pub. While there is a walkway through, there are chairs and bags blocking the way. Generally people are helpful but having to go through asking people to move is not good. Disabled parking in main Carpark has been moved further away, to allow Emirate Airlines and taxis to park closer! Making it more difficult for those with mobility restrictions Poorly sign posted how to get to disabled parking.  Member of party had to walk some distance to find a luggage trolley Drop off points  quite a walking distance for those with mobility restrictions Toilets easy to find, but difficult to access. Placed off a narrow corridor and difficult to manoevere wheelchair to access the toilet. Toilets have been updated and accessible toilet smaller than old one.no room to turn chair, had to wheel to side of toilet so my friend could shut door behind me and then repeat the process to reverse chair back out again. Otherwise clean, plenty of grabrails etc"
glasgow airport paisley,positive,"Lots of toilets , disabled or otherwise."
glasgow botanic gardens glasgow,positive,We got the bus and it stopped opposite the side gate on Great Western Road.  Don't remember parking access. Clean and plenty of room.
glasgow caledonian university glasgow,positive,It is next to Buchanan street bus station and has a under pass to go over the main road. It has blue badge parking In the older buildings they have disabled toilets with radar keys but in the newer building the toilets don't use the keys. They don't have a changing place toilet
glasgow central railway station glasgow,negative,"There is no parking at the station, unless you don't mind parking your car on the streets next to it. There is a bus stop directly infront of the stations main entrance. There is also a taxi rank outside main entrance, where you can either get dropped off or if you need a taxi, there is always taxis waiting outside."
glasgow central railway station glasgow,positive,Great transport from this railway station  their is 2 accessible toilets one of them is a changing places toilet  A great transport hub with loads of trains going to all parts and several long distance ones. Buses stopped outside the door and there was a taxi rank.
glasgow club easterhouse pool glasgow,positive,I find this dead easy for transport wise their is a disabled toilet with the pull cord system in this toilet 
glasgow club scotstoun glasgow,positive,"There is a healthy number of accessible parking bays on both sides of the centre, but signage when entering the car park could be better.   There are loos immediately as you enter the building and then again next to the changing area. They are cleaned regularly and had everything I needed to use them safely."
glasgow film theatre gft glasgow,positive,"The loos were easy enough to find, good signage and spacious enough for me.  The accessible toilet I visited near to screens two and three was large spacious well-equipped and spotlessly clean. It had a little more space than you often find. It's approached via a short corridor off of which you perform a 90° turn. There are accessible loos. due to the city centre this is hard for parking unless its after 6pm and you can park in the side streets for free I am not sure on this but I am guessing they would have disabled toilets"
glasgow fort glasgow,negative,"The first row of parking all the way around the complex has additional space blocked out on each side, allowing for car doors to be fully opened.  Transport to this venue is fairly limited unless you would be driving, there are a few buses that do stop, however the bus stop is in the middle of the car park, so to get to the main pathway you would need to cross traffic.   There is only one toilet facility that is not inside a shop or restaurant, and it is located in the middle of the complex, so  wouldn't say it is easily accessible to all.   Marks and Spencer has accessible toilets with both right and left handed transfer rails and changing facilities in both the male and female toilets.  There is only 1 disabled toilet within the park and its at the middle next to Zara, Asda has one inside the store, boots also has got one"
glasgow fort glasgow,positive,"There is lots of car parking spaces here and a lot of buses goes here, Just be warned some none blue badges some times parks in the disabled spaces Car park was very busy.  Can get buses to and from the City Centre. Very accessible lots of room."
glasgow golf centre glasgow,positive,"Good parking but no disabled bays Good clear sign Good Lots of spaces but no accessible bays. Nice and clean easy access Good access, well signed Good parking. Could use an accessible bay Good big toilets. Clear sign. Clean and accessible."
glasgow hm passport office block 2 4,negative,"Parking is good as there is a dedicated carpark and this includes blue badge parking spaces. If you are coming under your own steam such as wheeling from a nearby location as  a wheelchair user forget it! If you can negotiate the 6 inch curb you will manage to get in. There are two, clearly signposted, accessible toilets. Not having use them I can't comment further."
glasgow national hockey centre glasgow,positive,Disabled parking right outside the main entrance. 
glasgow queen street railway station glasgow,negative,There is no parking in the station area however there are a number of buses that pass by the station on the George Square side of the upper level.  These are run by a number of companies including First Bus Glasgow. There is a wheelchair accessible toilet however the signage for this is not very good. The toilet is located to your left as you exit the  ticket barrier on the upper level.  Station staff can point you in the right direction for this toilet
glasgow queen street railway station glasgow,positive,"No parking in the immediate area. Accessible toilet off main concourse. Quite large, RADAR key, usual facilities. Didn't park but the train service excellent Toilets on train at disabled area There are disabled parking spaces from the side entrance to the station. Low-level and high level trains can be accessed via a ramp which can be booked with Scotrail Passenger Assistance.  the transport to this station is good, only down side is no car parking but it is a station based within the town of Glasgow Not sure as we arrived by train. I think there is some disabled parking in the car park. There's a good accessible toilet but its hidden away round by the entrance to the underground station, opposite the small WH Smith. It requires a RADAR key."
glasgow royal concert hall glasgow,negative,"Car park is shared with Buchanan Galleries (Shopping Centre). (2 -3 minute walk outside) Located 5 minutes walk away from Queen Street station. Central station is about 10 - 15 minutes walk away. However, both station would require an uphill journey to the venue.  Buchanan bus station is located across the road with frequent bus routes from all over Scotland.   There are accessible toilets in the building. However, it is located at the back, near the cafe which might not be easily located. Space within the toilet was sufficient for moving around.  The loo I was guided to was across the other side of the theatre and hidden in the corner. I'm glad I didn't use a wheelchair as it would have been a tight squeeze. Disabled toilet is on main floor. Disabled seating in 2 floors up. The lift can only take one wheelchair and maybe 2 slim people at a time. I have been late back to the performance because I couldn’t get an empty lift  There's only street parking or multistory car parking, which can be a problem if you have a large wheelchair accessible vehicle. No parking immediately at the venue itself, but has a multi-storey across the road. This has marked disabled bays on the ground floor.  There is a height restriction to use this.   There can be parking in the nearby streets, depends on your luck, it is a city centre venue.  It is close to Queen Street train station, though Central isn't too far away. Also close to Buchanan Bus Station, and there will be local buses too. There are accessible toilets throughout the building, but we didn't use them We drove and parked at the concert car park across from the venue. Quite difficult to find the disabled spaces within the car park but once we did it was great and handy for the concert hall Really poorly sign posted. We had to ask several people before we found the disabled loos tucked overly discretely behind a screen in the cafe area. The toilet we used was very tight for a wheelchair user and companion. There were grab rails and an alarm. However the door lock and paper towel dispenser were both difficult to use. On the particular day of travel there was disruption on the railway which made my journey more difficult. Always check before you travel. If you are traveling by car there is Concert Square car park, however there is a height restriction for any particularly  tall cars. The height restriction is signposted at the entrance to the car park."
glasgow royal concert hall glasgow,positive,"Parking is available in the Buchanan Galleries car park (fee attached), but we were lucky enough to find on street parking (free with blue badge).   The venue is in the centre of Glasgow, so plenty of transport links. Buchanan bus station is directly opposite the disabled access entrance. The accessible toilets are hidden slightly and were a little difficult to find. This could be because it was such a busy event, so it may well be easier to find when the venue is quieter.   The looks themselves were quite tight and cramped. Far from the spacious changing places loos. Very close to Buchanan Bus Station, also car parking close by, but it closes before some concerts finish! Train stations are a bit far away. Two disabled toilets in main venue, others are available on the premises. Vacant/engaged signs could be clearer. This venue does have accessible toilets, but I didn't use them. Two accessibile  toilets are available. One beside the cafe which tends to be used by everyone. The second one is beside the cloakroom at the bottom of the main foyer. The first entrance to these toilets is unmarked. It is at the end of a long corridor beside other male and female toilets  Right next to the bus station and plenty parking. The accessible toilets are a lift journey away couple with fighting through the crowd of people in the hallway. One toilet is quite petite but the other has more space ."
glasgow science centre glasgow,negative,"Whilst the toilets themselves were nice, clean and spacious, they were hard to find. No clear signage could be seen by us. But there are accessible toilets within easy reach of the lifts and the red cords hang to the floor. "
glasgow science centre glasgow,positive,"There are lots of Disabled parking bays available in the car park. I haven't visited using public transport.  The loo has everything you could ask for, but unfortunately it isn't a changing places loo.  Using both public transport and driving to get to this venue was great with no issues.  They were on every floor but they were a bit untidy. All the parking is a little way from the entrance but there are blue badge spaces and the walk from them to the museum is flat. Public transport is available from Glasgow city centre. There was a disabled toilet on each floor but the downstairs one was hard to get in and to do so you had to block the entrance to the men's toilet which also made it hard to reverse out. The two I used had red cords that weren't quite straight down but did reach the floor. There were plenty of rails. Reasonably easy to access via public transport (either by bus or by train into Exhibition Centre). Finding the door in is a bit of an issue, but once you find it you're fine.  You have to pay for the parking. Details are on their web page."
glasgow tigers speedway glasgow,positive,Lots of disabled parking spaces right outside the stadium.  I arrived from Ashfield Station about 5/10 minute walk away - there is ramp access down to the station. There is a fairly large accessible loo with grab rails.
glastonbury abbey glastonbury,positive,Stewards directed us to disabled parking which was specifically allocated for disabled attendees and this small car park was close to the accessible entrance to the event.  The surface was reasonably smooth in my powerchair and there were a few spaces left when I got there.  
glen doll ranger base kirriemuir,negative,"There is an accessible loo which is located just to the right of the main entrance. It is quite a decent size however, the emergency cord was tied in a knot on the ceiling and also not next to the loo. "
glen doll ranger base kirriemuir,positive,The venue is only really accessible by car and there is a good car park very close to the visitor centre. 
glen nevis self catering park fort william,positive,"The Glen Nevis self-catering park is an easy drive from Fort William, and you can park by your caravan. There are buses too, with stops outside the park, but I didn't test their accessibility."
glendoick garden centre perth,negative,It doesn’t appear there is a bus stop or train station nearby. There are only about 5 disabled bays in this very busy car park. The car park ground is quite bumpy and uneven.
glendoick garden centre perth,positive,We travelled by car so not sure about public transport  Excellent disabled toilet with grab rails and red cord
gleneagles hotel gleneagles,negative,The only disappointment for us was the bathroom in our room. The shower is level and so you can roll in but it was tricky for us as it was tight to be in there with a carer. It was also quite tight getting past the bath to the shower. A wet room would be much easier and make the experience a lot better.
gleneagles hotel gleneagles,positive,"Great. They let us park very close to an entrance which was close to our room.   Public transport wise, the Gleneagles train station has great access since the Ryder Cup refurbishments. From there, the hotel staff will come and pick you up in a minibus."
gleneagles hotel golf resort gleneagles,positive,"I was unable to get into the public accessible toilets but the doors were a good size. The accessible toilets in the sponsors area were very spacious. I had a parking space booked in car park 3A. It was quite difficult to actually find car park 3A as there were very few signs to let us know where car park 3A was. When we arrived at the car park we were told to put our hazard lights on so the other staff knew that we were looking for disabled parking, I thought that this was a good idea that I've never seen in the past. There is also an accessible shuttle from the train station to car park 3A but I never used this so I can't comment.  There were 6 accessible toilets, 2 changing places toilet and 1 gender-neutral toilet. I went to both changing places toilets but I only went to one accessible toilet, in the spectator village. Both changing places toilets were fantastic, plenty of room inside and everything you need. I cannot fault the changing places toilets having said that, none of the toilet doors were automatic which could cause a problem if someone else didn't open the door for you, however, you needed a member of staff to open the toilet door with a key and they keep the door open for you. The accessible toilet hasn't got a key, I couldn't get in the toilet because someone was in it. Then an able-bodied person walked out and it made me think, why did the changing places toilet have a key but not the accessible toilet? We had a Car Park pass for car park 3A. We drove from Edinburgh and picked up the event signs for the Solheim Cup from before Perth, including signs indicating how long was still to go. We followed signs for Car Park 3 and then on entering we were directed to the end of the car park where the accessible parking area was located.  At this end of the car park we were able to get out on to the tracking and then move the car to a parking spot on the grass.   Impressed to see a large sign and temporary building which had mobility scooters that you could hire - plus, not only an accessible loo, but a proper Changing Places loo too!  We saw lots of loos and accessible loos signposted in the car park and the spectators village, they were also clearly marked on the map. Our favourite by far was the brilliant Changing Places toilet at the car park - a brilliant idea to aid with the start and finish of our visit. Most spectators are coming via train. Gleneagles is the nearest station and if you require it there is accessible transport between the station and the event. Gleneagles Station has recently undergone refurbishment and is now more accessible. If coming by car, there is dedicated parking for Blue Badge holders - it is a fair distance away from the event so there are accessible buses to get you there. If you have specific mobility requirements contact the event organisers as there are limited spaces available in Car Park 2 which is much nearer. For an event. the organisers have done a great job with the accessible loos. The are located with the ladies and gents loos and have ramped access. They are well signed and are spacious."
gleneagles railway station gleneagles,positive,"Parking spaces are right outside the station , bus links available Available at the station - really good size There are at least 4 disabled parking spaces very clearly marked."
glenelg and arnisdale community hall kirkton,positive,"Two identified parking spaces at the rear, by the toilets. Plenty of flat parking to the front too. Not marked but easy to find once we were directed. It's just on the other side of the hall."
glenesk hotel edzell,positive,Parking on site.  Best to access by car as rural setting means public transport will be infrequent. There is no accessible toilet at the moment however an accessible bedroom with ensuite wetroom (beautiful) was made available for wheelchair users and a portable frame was installed in the ladies toilet for the use of those who required it.  This would have been rated 5stars if there had been a separate accessible toilet.
glenesk retreat and folk museum glenesk,positive,Dedicated disabled parking area On ground floor adjacent to other loos.   Good condition with usual facilities.
glenkinchie distillery tranent,positive,"We arrived by car and found the accessible parking area to be a great bonus. A signpost pointed us toward the disabled parking bays by the main entrance. Deploying the blue badge and getting my pal's wheelchair out of the car we were ready for action. The parking bays were very good as there were markings on both sides of the space and to the rear to ensure space was available for wheelchair transfer. A short walk of no more than forty of so metres following the garden path and we were at the front door. We used the loos on a couple occasions. I used the standard loos and my pal went off to find the accessible loo. They were spotlessly clean, bright, light and with plenty of space.   My pal reported back on the accessible loos and said they were very good with enough space to manoeuvre, plenty of grab rails and everything within easy reach. He commented that it was good to see that different loos had different transfer spaces too; some left hand and some right hand.  As loos go these were very good."
glenmore forest park   including loch morlich beach aviemore,positive,I think there's a bus from Aviemore. Plenty of space for parking for free or pay and display in the forestry commission car parks. 
glenmoriston townhouse hotel inverness,positive,"There are two disabled spaces available on site.  The hotel is situated on the riverside and is fairly centrally located in Inverness.  The bus and train stations are about a 10 minute wheel away; there are taxis available outside the train station.  There is also on-street parking available outside the hotel.   There is a disabled toilet off the bar and to the hotel's credit, they are going to make the doorway wider for powerchairs as it's a bit tight.  Inside, the toilet is clean and spacious and it has grab rails. "
glenogle swim centre edinburgh,negative,"On street parking at the entrance though not many spaces. Unsure about nearest bus service There is on street parking, but not many available and it is a residential area. "
glenrothes mens shed glenrothes,positive,"Parking, yes"
glenshee ski centre ballater,negative,"Blue badge got us nearer the main part. Functional but only the one Glenshee has a large carpark which is conveniently close to the Centre/slopes - in comparison to other ski centres.  Be aware though, occasionally on busy weekends/holidays this can be totally full by early in the morning, so you need to be there early to be sure you get in (were talking by 8.30am early!). We went on a weekday and it was fine.  The car-park is a large rough area of ground, there didn't appear to be any markings, disabled spaces or otherwise.  I am not aware of any public transport. Some ski-clubs do organise coaches, and sometimes via Facebook etc you can find people wanting to car-share.  I didn't use this, however did notice there was an accessible toilet within the cafe at the base of the slopes (where the main centre is and nearest the car-park) There are two other cafes further up, I'm not sure if they also have accessible toilets or not.  I wasn't aware of a changing-places toilet, and think it would be really useful for them to have. You need to wear lots of clothes for the snow so it's easier to be able to have space to get changed/go to toilet. You also tend to be at the Centre for a full day and/or travelled to get there, so people do need the toilet!!"
globe arena morecambe,negative,"The toilet facilities were very accessible, very spacious for me. As they had grab rails for me to use I thought that the bathroom was very clean and tidy, There was room for my carer to assist me if needed. Although there are no changing beds available to use if at all people require them. "
globe arena morecambe,positive,I got a wheelchair accessible taxi and was able to get dropped off right outside the entrance.  
gloucester quays outlet gloucester,positive,plenty of disabled parking near lifts OK for me when using my crutches
gloucester services quedgeley,negative,"lack of Changing Place Facility, overhead Trackhoist and adult sized changing place, as recommended by British Standards BS 8300:2009"
gloucester services quedgeley,positive,There is masses of disabled parking outside the main entrance.  This is one of the few services locations I have seen where the arriving/departing traffic is not a hazard for those who have to load or unload a wheelchair The accessible loos are huge including all the usual grab rails etc - and also provide showering facilities.  Also well maintained and clean Lots of wide spaces directly outside the main building entrance - no roads to cross... The disabled loo at the new Gloucester Services on the M5 is amazing - sorry no pictures but try it for yourself!  Masses of space and top notch facilities
go live at the green glasgow,positive,"Within the city, Glasgow Green is fairly easy to get to.  There is parking on the streets nearby, also several car parks within a 5-10 minute walk eg near St Enoch's shopping Centre.  The train stations are a bit further away, the closest being Glasgow Central or High Street. There are also buses and underground. There are lots of portaloos, including accessible ones.  There was also a MobiLoo - which I had never seen before. It looks like a small van and on the side it says 'a vehicle for change.' Inside is a full accessible bathroom, complete with changing plinth and hoist. It has ramp access, and a member of staff is there to help if required.  The information in the events brochure lists where there are permanent changing places toilets, nearby in the city."
go mobility now barcelona,positive,"Barcelona has very good accessible buses and metro, and I took my rented scooter on both."
go outdoors coatbridge,negative,There are only two 2 toilets in the store one male one female these are located next to the checkout area on the left hand side as you go in.  Both toilet doors open out the way you can get a wheelchair in however there is a plastic guard on the back of the door that block the area it does move but is a bit of a issue both getting in and out of the toilet. There was also a lot of goods being displayed next to this area in metal baskets that were in the way.
go outdoors coatbridge,positive,There are 6 Blue Badge spaces to the right hand side of the main door. The nearest public transport links is the bus stop  out on Coatbridge Main St along from the Coatdyke Roundabout.
goddard veterinary group london,negative,"Several bus routes pass nearby, but there are no step-free stations in the area.  "
goddards house and garden york,negative,I didn't use the toilet while I was there. There is a toilet on the ground floor and this is not disabled accessible.
goddards house and garden york,positive,"There are local buses that stop nearby and car park area in front of the house. I travelled by taxi from York Station and it cost about £7, each way. "
godinton house and gardens ashford,positive,"At least six accessible parking spaces, not lined, on solid level surface with just a few loose stones. Parking is easy to find and in view of the entrance.  On site the accessible toilet is accessed via a shared entrance hall to the Ladies.  The space is good and well lit with all support rails present. No key needed. The nearest changing places toilet is in Ashford Gateway, several miles away. "
gods own junkyard london,negative," This is in a small industrial estate in Walthamstow. It can be reached by Victoria underground line from central London, but there is a walk from the station, so if mobility is difficult you may want to look at local buses/taxi. There is only one toilet for all customers to use. This isn't an accessible toilet.  This is up a couple of stairs, so wouldn't be suitable for people with mobility difficulties.  I'm not sure if it is possible for them to do anything to change this within the building"
golden bahia de tossa spa caldes de malavella,positive,Disabled access toilets on the ground floor in multiple locations.
golden jubilee bridges london,positive,There's an accessible toilet in Charing Cross Station where the accessible route ends. There are good public transport links on both sides - particularly Waterloo which we used as an accessible hub throughout our London trip. Not really too sure about parking - would imagine it would be fairly busy and expensive to park nearby.
golf del sur oasis del sur,positive,Free parking at the hotel. We got a taxi from the airport which is less than 10 mins away and cost !5 Euros.   The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to Playa Las Americas which is great if you are able to get on and off a bus. Best accessible bathroom I have ever stayed at. Great disabled toilets around the complex
gooderstone water gardens gooderstone,positive,"No public transport nearby (there might be local bus?). Parking plentiful and easy, Companion ticket (two for one) for wheelchair users but make sure you ask. There is an annula season ticket - well worth getting if you live locally. Large accessible toilet near the tearoom, not far from the entrance. Plenty of space for manoeuvring and for a carer. Grab rails."
goodison park liverpool,positive,We drove around side streets and were lucky to find a disabled space near the ground.
goodman city london,negative,Was dropped off by my PA. Parking in that part of London is really difficult to find. Bank Station is nearby and the DLR platforms are accessible. There was an accessible loo but I didn't use / need it so cannot provide any helpful comment on this.
goodwood racecourse chichester,negative,Sadly Goodwood is in a remote location so a car is without doubt your best bet. I'd be surprised if buses don't detour to the course on race days though. Given the amount of staff they'll be no shortage of advise with regard to public transport - I've seen them willingly booked taxis when asked.
gordale scar malham,negative,Parking is informal. Take the road from Malham up towards the Scar (signposted). Parking at roadside and therefore not designated as blue badge. It's popular here so you take a chance on there being space.
gorebridge leisure centre gorebridge,positive,"We drove, there was dedicated disabled parking, next to the building, with space to move around safely.  And a steward who directed us to the dedicated parking"
gorgie city farm edinburgh,negative,"Parking is limited but you are able to drive right into the farm and adjacent to the buildings; albeit on a slope. There are two blue badge spaces within the farm, otherwise parking nearby is difficult."
gothenburg goteborg,positive,We didn't drive hotels were central. The train was excellent.
gouldings garden centre carluke,positive,Carpark out front with several disabled spaces. We drove but think it's on the bus route to Lanark.  Good toilet situated near the cafe. Only reason I marked it down was it didn't have a red cord.
gourdie croft beefeater dundee,positive,"Outside this venue there are a great number of disabled parking bays right at the front door. The venue is situated just off the road and is connected the the Premier Inn Dundee West if you require overnight accomodation. There is an accessible loo situated to the right hand side of the bar area on entering the building away from the main toilets and is always open so no need to have to ask for a key! It is a good size, clean and checked on a regular basis. No shortage of hand rails that's for sure, it is big enough for a chair and a carer if required. There is a pull cord within reach should you need assistance. The tap is also really easy to use if you have weakness in your upper body."
gourmet burger kitchen birmingham,positive,There is lots of disabled parking close by if you use your disabled parking pass. As it is in the middle of town there is lots of buses and trains which go there regularly. The toilet in  is really easy to access and is extremely spacious so you can spread out if you need to and there is plenty of room to get a power chair in
gourmet burger kitchen cardiff,positive,Cardiff is an excellent city for any disabled visitor. Fully accessible toilet facilities on the ground floor. RADAR scheme key but not a problem if you've forgotten yours. Bog standard. LOL! No changing mat. Needs a radar key. I had my own but they probably have one available. It was right at the back and there is space for a carer.
govindas pure vegetarian restaurant london,negative,"I used London buses, getting there from Park Lane (where my coach dropped me), crossing by the Animals in War Monument, and catching the 309 along Oxford Street.  Afterwards I wanted to take a 24 or 29 to Trafalgar Square - but Transport for London stop the buses at the drop of a hat and the 24 and 29 were terminating on Tottenham Court Road.  I was obliged to detour back along Oxford Street to Marble Arch / top of Park lane, from where I was able to catch the number 6."
goytre wharf abergavenny,positive,In the car park. Free for blue badge holders.
grain and hearth bakery whitstable,positive,"A big toilet with grab rails, space for a wheelchair and an alarm. "
grainger market newcastle upon tyne,positive,Right in centre of Newcastle so we just popped in from the street. Not sure about where you would park nearby.
grammar lodge campbeltown,negative,"We flew in on a private aircraft with a group from Aerobility. Taxis from airport was a mini van, unfortunately no whelchair access so had to be transfered."
grammar lodge campbeltown,positive,"Clean and modern bathroom with grab rails. Shower with seat and half height movabe screen, Very clean and modern There's disabled parking right next to the main entrance.  The hotel is right in the centre of Campbeltown.  It is en suite. Lots of space to manoeuvre, excellent grab rails, flawlessly clean and tidy, plenty of space for a carer. No hoist."
grampian property centre forres,positive,There is  ample offstreet parking with plenty of disabled bays.  
gran canaria airport las palmas,negative,The disabled toilets at Gran Canaria airport are big and spacious but the tissues are right beside the help button and I accidently hit the help button when I reached for tissues so I recommend that they move the help button.  
grand central birmingham,negative,"Cannot comment on the disabled parking as did not use, however from previous knowledge know that there is car parks linked throughout the city centre that have a large number of disabled parking that would make it accessible to Grand Central. During our visit, we used the train, and as Grand Central is connected to the train station it is accessible from the train station via lift or escalators. The train station is a level surface meaning that should people require it it is easy for manovourability. "
grand central hotel glasgow,negative,The hotel is situated within Glasgow Central Station. There is a car park 0.8 miles from the hotel. There is one road to cross before reaching the hotel.  
grand central hotel glasgow,positive,Toilets available on all floors. Signposts advising where disabled toilets are available. Disabled toilets were spacious with fixed grab rails.
grand harbour hotel southampton,positive,Good hotel parking facility Good lobby and room toilets
grand hotel du palais royal paris 1er arrondissement,positive,"If you need a wheelchair accessible vehicle, speak to the concierge as one of the taxi firms specialises in this. Spacious bathroom. Wet room with powerful rain shower."
grand hotel torquay,positive,"The Grand is directly opposite Torquay railway station and then a 2 minute walk through the car park. The station has a passenger bridge over to the opposite platform, but no lift, but alternatively customers can follow a step free route over a road bridge. There are several buses that pass close by to the hotel. The hotel has a garage and parking is on a first come first served basis.  The public accessible toilet on the ground floor had grab rails and an emergency alarm cord. It was clean and spacious. "
grand theatre wolverhampton,negative,"There are plenty of car parks within a small area of the Theatre, All Council run car parks, at decent charges"
grand western canal country park tiverton,positive,"Several car parks along the way but if you are unsure, head for Tiverton canal car park.  Accessible loo at Tiverton canal car park."
grange farm ryde,positive,Parking by the door level access to front door  Local busses stop at the end of a short drive from the main road Short drive from either East Cowes or Fishbourne Ferry Terminals
grangemouth sports complex grangemouth,negative,The two  doors to  the men’s disabled toilets were heavy and awkward to get through.   Especially if you are left handed like I am.
grangemouth sports complex grangemouth,positive,"There is a bus stop very close to the Complex's entrance. Ramps instead of stairs, power assisted doors, a chair hoist and the disabled parking is right next to the pavement by the main entrance. Not the easiest to find but room to move. Sink with large mirror and hand dryers."
grant park lossiemouth,positive,We parked about 2 minutes away from the ground. I also noticed there were 2 disabled car parking spaces opposite the ground. The nearest bus stop is about 5 minutes away from the ground at James Square.
grantham meres leisure centre grantham,positive,Good number of disabled parking right outside athletics track entrance. All toilets accessible around all parts of the track.
grantley hall ripon,negative,The disabled WC in the main hotel is about 30 metres from Fletchers and about 5 from Shaun Rankins Restaurant. The grab rails are sufficient and there is enough room to turn around. It has always been clean & tidy
grantley hall ripon,positive,Parking is possible within 5 metres of the front door provided you notify them of this requirement in advance. The doormen are very helpful and I felt safe being wheeled in to the Hotel and then up to our room.
grasmere house hotel salisbury,positive,"The hotel has its own carpark. There is plenty of space, including room directly outside the front door. The surface was slightly loose gravel, but the transfers were manageable independently.  Spotless. The room had a wheel in shower with flip-down shower seat. The toilet had a grab rail that could be put into a horizontal or vertical position. There was room under the sink to wheel under."
grassmarket community project edinburgh,negative,"The toilet was large, with plenty of space for my electric wheelchair. The lights go out automatically after a few minutes (even though I was still moving). There is also no mirror in the accessible toilet, which meant I couldn't check my makeup. Limited on street parking close by as it's on a junction. Possible to park further along the street."
grassmarket community project edinburgh,positive,"There is no parking. The accessible toilets on both floors were spacious, well equipped and spotlessly clean. The public transport in the area is good with regular tour buses running though the Grassmarket as well as local buses. Parking on street (for Blue Badge Holders) is available nearby but it can be very busy at times. A spacious, clean and tidy accessible toilet it clearly signposted off the main hallway. It a very spacious room with plenty of manoeuvring space as well as space for carers. Grassmarket parking available but there is still quite a walk to the entrance. There a some bus stops reasonably close. Superb accessible toilet just of the main cafe area. Good wide door, bright and light, with plenty of space to manoeuvre. Easily room for a carer / PA if required. Grab rails and fittings all at good height and easy to access."
graze belfast,negative,"There is a car park at rear of building but it can get busy and be a bit of a squeeze. There is some on street parking which is handy but road works at the moment meant it wasn’t all available when I visited. Separate Disabled toilet easily accessed at back of restaurant with other toilets. Large room with grab rails, clean with low level basin, mirror etc. But I can only give 2 stars ⭐️ as the emergency cord was plaited so it was about half a meter of the floor. I spoke to a member of staff and pointed out that this needed to be rectified ( I didn’t do it as it would have taken me 1/2 an hour to un tangle) they said that they had no idea it was an issue, thanked me for pointing it out and said they would pass it on . I left Euan’s notice attached. "
great hall of the university of leeds leeds,negative,"For graduation days, a nearby zone is reserved for disabled car parking. Only cars who have booked to use these spots, and show their valid blue badge on the day may use these spaces. There are other small areas dotted around campus that are accessible with a blue badge, but on the whole car parking on campus is not viable. There are several nearby bus stops on prominent bus routes, and also a rank of taxis outside the famous clock-tower on Woodhouse Lane. The pavement is smooth and mostly level, making pedestrian access ideal. There is a disabled toilet available on the corridor between the Clothworkers Yard entrance and lift, but given the narrow corridor this is impractical to get in to. There are several other more accessible toilets available in other buildings, including full changing facilities, if preferred (see Leeds University Union review)."
great missenden parish church   st peter st paul great missenden,negative,"The grave is about a 15 minutes walk from Great Missenden Train Station. There are regular trains from London. Exiting the station from trains from London, there is a choice of a footbridge with no lift or a step free, slightly uphill path, which is signposted Way Out and with a wheelchair symbol, see photo.   I walked from the station. Then there is a slight hill street down to the High Street. The High Street is flat and walk by the Roald Dahl Museum and turn left into Church Street. I would suggest crossing over to the opposite side of Church Street as it easier to cross here than further up. Then turn right into Church Lane. Soon after the turning the road goes uphill slightly, but enough to make me feel out of breath, see photo. There is one part of the pavement when I visited that was overgrown with brambles and I had to walk on the road. (At this point I got chatting to a lady taking her dog for a walk and mentioned this. She said that unless there is a service/event on at the church there is usually very few cars along that road. A little further up there is a bridge to cross and then directly afterwards the Church of St Peter and Paul is on the right and the cemetery on the left.  If you had a car/ taxi you could go to the entrance of the cemetery."
great north museum hancock newcastle upon tyne,positive,"The are plenty of accessible toilets on both the ground and first floor of the museum with powered doors and automatic taps in addition to plenty of space for a wheelchair. I don't drive and thus took public transport. However, there are four accessible parking bays at the front of the museum for use by disabled visitors who hold a Blue Badge.   We went by metro which was about 5-10 minutes roll from Haymarket Metro station and the museum is well signposted from Haymarket.   There is also a Haymarket bus interchange which lots of buses go to and also is clearly signposted.  If you cycle, the museum has lots of bike racks right outside the main entrance. There are accessible toilets on every floor of the museum but they do not use the RADAR key. On the ground floor, the accessible toilet also has an accessible shower and an adult changing table. They are very spacious and definitely would have enough space for a wheelchair and at least one PA/carer. I also liked that not only does the tap of the sink have power assistance, but so does the entrance and locking of the door. However, the red cord does not reach to the floor which could cause issues. "
great orme country park visitor centre llandudno,negative,"We drove the parking is plentyful however there are a limited number of blue badge spaces which you have to use or you have to pay so if a few disabled people go some may have to pay to park. It is up a very steep hill so wheeling up there in a wheelchair is out of the question There were two disabled toilets , one in the cafe which was hidden behind a staff area and was difficult to find, I had to go past produce in packaging to get to it It was a bit of a squash getting past this produce to get to the loo and the loo it's self was quite small but do able. The other was in the museum whilst it was a bit roomier it was a bit of a squeeze to get my chair around."
greater easterhouse supporting hands glasgow metropolitan area,positive,"Their is a car park within the venue, its on a major road just behind the Glasgow Fort There is accessible loo what has recently been done up and they are at the centre of the venue"
greatkingstdental dumfries,positive,"A disabled parking space at door but on a public Street so may not be available,  2 disabled bays further down the street  right next to bus stops where wheelchair accessible buses stop. Pavement uneven, making it difficult for self propelling wheelchair users Sliding doors,  ? toilet well signposted and next to reception area. Roomy and plenty grabrails although dropdown rail at one side seems to be missing"
greek artisan pastries edinburgh,negative,Walked/bus. Not great on street parking but there is a car park round the back in Bride Street. 
green gates indian restaurant renfrew,negative,There is on street parking and accidentally lowered (collapsed) kerbs with a very small parking area at the side. There are buses that go that way too as its not far from the health centre or braehead shopping centre but I can't comment on their reliability as I can't use public transport myself.
green gates indian restaurant renfrew,positive,Very good sized accessible loo but you'll probably have to ask someone to move the baby changing unit before you can use it.
green meadows edinburgh,positive,Near bus stops on Buccleuch Street (number 41 and 42) and South Clerk Street. There is some street parking in surrounding streets which is a mix of permit holders only and pay and display Monday to Saturday. I'm not sure if there are any spaces for blue badge holders. 
green monkey london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby, there is no parking in the area, and buses 155, 219, 355, 249 and 319 pass by very close to the café."
green monkey london,positive,"Disabled access and right next to Tooting Bec station, excellent spot for great tasting healthy food, and so easy to get to. Hop on the northern line "
greenbanks hotel and self catering barn in norfolk great fransham,positive,"Plenty of disabled parking on hardstanding outside rooms.  Brilliant access in rooms. Grab handles and supports very handy.  Came by car. Disabled spaces. Not a changing place toilet but big wetroom. Shower seat too small only criticism. Parking next to disabled accommodation Accommodation has excellent wet room and accessible loo Used private car to travel to Greenbanks. Excellent flat tarmacked space just outside Barn part of hotel with ramp to door of apartment . Full access to large wheel in shower , toilet and sink. Shower chair provided by owners.  Bath also installed with space under for hoist ."
greenlands farm village carnforth,negative,"Gravel car park lots of space and disabled bays. Can be difficult for wheel chairs you will need assistance due to doors open on to each other, however they are wide doors. No hoist in the toilet."
greenwood family park y felinheli,negative,"Designated area, but very hard  to find.  Rough surface.  Not enough room if more than 3 cars turned up.  No Markings at all, so those needing extra space at the side could find a car parked next to them stopping them getting back into their car. Through very, very heavy door form shop to corridor and then the door immediately in front was the accessible toilet - so no chance of holding one door whilst opening another, which also had the heaviest fire closure I have ever encountered.  Toilet small, with no transfer space, alarm cord cut off and the small piece left hooked over a very high window sill.  Could not get out of the toilet and got trapped in there for 15 minutes.  Other accessible toilet in the park was bigger, but still had a door with such a heavy fire closure that I could not get in or out without assistance."
greenwood london,positive,I came by train but unfortunately on the day I chose to travel there were no Victoria trains due to Engineering works so I travelled by South West Trains to Waterloo and then taxi. The benefit of travelling South West Trains is there is currently always a guard on the train so I do not have to worry about ramps to get either on or off the train. Clean and spacious. Staff pointed me in the direction of the toilet which was at the rear of the bar. See photo. Shame the red emergency cord was not floor length.
greggs glasgow,negative,"None of the toilets seemed to be particularly attractive!  There is a door from the cafe area then a fairly narrow short corridor to the toilets.   The accessible toilet is not very large to start with, and the position of the toilet and sink mean it could be quite difficult for some people (especially if require carers).  Unfortunately it had been felt necessary to store a very large bin in the bathroom, meaning the toilet was inaccessible.  There was a red cord, but this did not reach the toilet. It was also made more inaccessible by the bin being there.  The toilet is also the baby change area. "
greggs glasgow,positive,"Ha ha, is within Buchanan Bus Station, so can't really be nearer transport!  Is also right next door to  large multi-storey carpark (Concert Hall Carpark).  Glasgow Queen Street train station is a short walk away. "
greswolde arms hotel solihull,negative,"It is clean, well maintained, but just practical, with grab rails, and you could turn wheelchair in there."
greswolde arms hotel solihull,positive,"It is a nice approach into Knowle, worth seeing the old village, (photo 1)  and has its own carpark, free if using the hotel facilities. (photo 2)  with two disabled bays (3)."
gretna gateway outlet village gretna,positive,All parking is accessible though the disabled bays are generally full if the place is busy Roomy and clean There are ten blue badge spaces in car park nearest to shops.  Take the access road nearest shops and drive to bottom of complex. Eight more spaces and really good toilets at this end. Toilets are in the corner down from Pizza Express. Not very clearly marked but because of this not abused. Very clean. Separate toilets for left and right transfer.  Excellent. Clean and accessible. All amenities.  Best toilets are to right of Pizza Express in corner next to Next Outlet. 
grey cardiff,negative,Bus stops a few hundred yards away. Taxis also. No parking that I know of. Impossible to find. I followed the signs for the toilets through a very cold area and ended up at the top of a flight of stairs. I retraced my steps and saw a sign for an accessible toilet. It led me past a function room and there the signs ended. I had to ask at reception. There are two accessible toilets right next to the main entrance but no indication that there are toilets behind the doors. Appalling!
greyfriars kirk edinburgh,negative,"There isn't any parking nearby and public transport is some distance away. If a car/transport is required to access this venue, prior notice needs to be given to have the gates opened. Public transport is close by which is good but there are some cobbles to negotiate. There is a disabled toilet, with a ramp to it - the only slight extra consideration is there are 2 swing doors to negotiate to access the bathroom - so a wheelchair user on their own would struggle with this"
greyfriars kirk edinburgh,positive,"There are 5 parking spaces available at the front door of the church for those who require close access. This was a great help for us so we didn't have to negotiate the cobbles on the path up from the road. They advise that you phone ahead to reserve a space.    Public transport wise there are numerous buses that stop on George IV bridge,  the only downside being the short hill (and cobbles) to climb up to the front of the church."
grill 48 bar and grill dunfermline,negative,Seat outside for rest or carer to wait. Didn't notice if there were rails but seemed not too small. 
grill 48 bar and grill dunfermline,positive,parking outside venue. There was a bue card bay close by.
grille restaurant bar lincoln,positive,Easy to locate from our seat
grimwith reservoir skipton,positive,"Radar key operated accessible loo, though it wasn't locked when I visited. Very well equipped and clean. Well done, Yorkshire Water."
grindon farm haydon bridge,positive,There's space for a wheelchair accessible vehicle and another car directly outside the property - the car parking area was gravel but this was firm enough to be able to move the wheelchair around easily The large wet room is over 4m2 which enabled us to bring the shower seat that we needed to use - just what we needed.
gro coffee irvine,negative,The only let down to this place is its loos. The door to the corridor where the loos are is very heavy to push open and neigh on impossible to pull open upon leaving. The loo is small not helped by the fact that a baby changing table is also squeezed in making it impossible to get to the sink. I had to reverse out! Try not use the loo or take sanitising wipes for your hands.
gro coffee irvine,positive,"The café is next to a huge car park with ample spaces off Beach Drive. We parked nearer on Harbour Street almost road side using an end bay next to a kerb, parking far enough away to allow me to transfer into my chair. I couldn't see any marked disabled bays outside the café. There is a dropped kerb outside the entrance. The train station is about 1/2 a mile away at the end of Harbour Street.   "
grosvenor cinema glasgow,positive,Accessible toilets are available on the ground floor of The Grosvenor Cinema on the right just after the ticket counter. Adequate cleanliness and basic aids were in place.
grosvenor hotel stratford upon avon,positive,"There are 3 disabled parking bays at the rear of the building and ramped entrance to reception from there. Doors are heavy, however, and assistance may be required to open them. There are accessible toilets close to the bar and restaurant."
grupotel farrutx can picafort,positive,I travelled from the airport to the hotel by taxi which was provided by Tui.  The toilet in the lobby was spacious however there was only one grab rail to use.
guayarmina princess costa adeje,positive,We used wheelchair access taxis and a travel Counsellor to arrange our airport needs. Easy. Bars to assist needed on some
guggenheim museum bilbao bilbao,positive,"We went by tram and got off at Guggenheim Sagrado Corazon. Trams are frequent, easy to use, and have level boarding access. They've got one, that's all I can tell you!  we traveled by bus ....that had a lift to get t."
guide dogs scotland   forfar training school forfar,positive,There is disabled parking bays near the entrance to the building  There is an accessible toilet on the ground floor
guided busway leigh,negative,"There are 3 park and ride car parks at East Bond Street in Leigh, Astley Street Exchange in Leigh and Wardley and an accessible toilet near to the stop at Leigh bus station. All are well used (bar Wardley) and have accessible parking. However, the latter remains inaccessible to many as they are frequently blocked by workmen and taxis and they are on a slight incline at Tyldesley Astley Street Exchange and a steeper incline at Wardley. Many of the remaining spaces are being used by staff at local businesses for all day parking rather than to use the bus services."
guildford train station guildford,positive,"There are blue badge spaces in the station car park opposite the main entrance plus a few at the far end (on the left beyond the taxi ramp).  Sadly Guildford's bus station is some way away. Near main entrance, alongside regular loos, the accessible loo is radar key operated. It's large, well equipped and clean."
guildfords yvonne arnaud theatre guildford,negative,There are just 2 blue badge bays outside and these are often abused. There's a small access road to the theatre which has double yellow lines. Arrive in plenty of time to park. If you're unlucky there's a public car park about five minutes away. I have been to this theatre on many occasions but never managed to park in the 2 disabled spaces. These spaces are also located parallel to the kerb and not very accessible for a WAV. There are a further 3 blue badge spaces located in a public car park 100 metres away. The car park is large and considering the number of blue badge holders I am surprised there are only 3 designated blue badge spaces. 
guildfords yvonne arnaud theatre guildford,positive,Accessible disabled loo with a sliding door. Great location just a few metres from the disabled entry/exit. See photo !
guildhall bury saint edmunds,positive,The accessible toilet is spacious and fully equipped. It was extremely clean!
guildhall londonderry,positive,A carpark with disabled parking is located close to the Guildhall.  The local bus station on Foyle Street is a few minutes walk from the Guildhall.  Local buses also stop very close to the building. I didn't use the accessible toilets but noticed them on all levels I visited very close to the large modern lift.
guinness storehouse dublin,negative,There are only a few disabled parking spaces at the storehouse itself. Public transport brings you close but not right to the door. There is an are where you can be dropped off and collected which may be more convenient. 
guinness storehouse dublin,positive,"I travelled by Public Transport (Luas) from the City Centre Red Zone, bound for Tallaght and got off at  St James Street which was approx an 5-7 minute wheel from the Luas stop.   Accessible toilets available on every floor which were easy to find. There are accessible toilets located on every floor and all are clearly sign posted. "
gulbenkian canterbury,positive,"Plenty of Blue badge parking in large car park on side of building. There are disabled spaces on the University campus, but none directly provided for Gulbenkian users nor are any right next tot he entry doors. There used to be some but they have been built over and no new ones provided to replace them. There is a disabled loo but it is through a heavy door that is the only way to all loos so can be congested and clumsy to manoeuvre through."
gullane bents gullane,positive,Blue badge disabled parking spaces are available. Definitely don't recommend trying to get public transport as its in the middle of nowhere!
gunsgreen house eyemouth,positive,Disabled parking available in the car park near the property
gunwharf quays portsmouth,positive,"it got 4 stars due to having to pay full price.  Bays are well marked and plenty of them, although i visited mid week and parking was busy.  The good thing is once you've paid the barrier rasies without the ticket being inserted. Clearly signed where and how many spaces were available. I was able to use the toilet without my friend having to watch me."
gusto restaurant edinburgh,positive,"Blue badge holders can park in the middle section of George Street with no restrictions. However as it is the very centre of town, it's pot luck if you get a space or not! Dedicated large disabled toilets to the back of the restaurant."
guy christian bay salon cardiff,negative,Disabled toilet limited space but ok.
gv royal mile hotel edinburgh,positive,For me public transport is important. I was able to get to the hotel easily using the local bus service. Lothian Buses are all accessible and the drivers are particularly helpful in letting me know when we have arrived at my destination bus stop.  Taxis drop off outside the door and can pick up from the same spot.  If you were visiting by car the hotel does have an underground car park which can be used by prior arrangement. There was an accessible toilet near the bar area. No disabled parking but easy in a bus or taxi
gwesty seren hotel llan ffestiniog,positive,I had to use public wetroom as couldn't handle our bathroom set up but it was clean and spacious.
gylptoteket copenhagen,positive,"The  Glyptoteket is in the city centre. There are many buses that stop directly outside. The buses and metro in Copenhagen is accessible. The gallery is next door to Tivoli. There are accessible toilets in the basement which I used, and also by the French Paintings. The accessible toilet was spacious, clean and had grab rails but no emergency cord."
h h hair design gateshead,positive,All parking is free with ample room for minibus parking Disabled facilities Free parking including mini bus bays and disabled bays all free . Good publis transport links . The nearest metro station is Gateshead stadium which is wheelchair friendly . A beautiful walkway all level surface with only one minor road leads you all  the way to HH Hair Design . The toilet facilities are accessible for wheelchair users
ha lo prison hanoi,negative,Walked to the venue but appeared to be parking outside  Clean toilets but no disabled access 
haarlem haarlem,negative,"As in most Dutch cities, there are few public loos and even fewer wheelchair-accessible loos. In Haarlem you depend on finding restaurants or museums which have them. The train station has an accessible loo but it’s ten minutes’ wheel from the centre and we didn’t sample it."
habitat london,negative,"The nearest tube station is Sloane Square, which is not step-free, but does have escalators from the westbound (but NOT the eastbound) platform to street level, so if you can get out of your wheelchair and take it up an escalator, this station may be an option. Loads of buses go along the King's Road. I wouldn't attempt to park nearby."
hackness grange hotel scarborough,positive,Park in the disabled bays directly opposite the front door. Either phone for assistance or ask your companion to pop in to reception to request it. The current wheelchair ramp takes you to the less obvious Function room and Courtyard entrance which is ideal for wheelchair users.  
hackney museum london,positive,Excellent
hair at the hub innerleithen,positive,"Parking is on the street in the side road. Depending on the time of day you can park near the entrance, there is also a good bus service from Edinburgh to the town and the bus stops on the high street."
haldon forest park exeter,positive,"Plenty of space Good, nothing amazing but adequate Contactless payment for carpark but brilliant cycle tracks and course - easy walking areas Very clean and well looked after"
haley clifford leeds,negative,"There is a small amount of parking for the row of shops right outside, but during busy periods there may not be spaces. There is not a designated disabled parking space. Street parking may be available down the side streets.   There is a bus stop over the road if using public transport, and it is near to a traffic light to cross the road."
halfords   derby wyvern derby,negative,Two parking bays outside. Bus access is difficult. They're currently building a wheelchair accessible bridge so you can walk to the Wyvern from Chaddesden. 
halfords braehead,positive,Loads of disabled bays  right in front of the store
hall place and gardens dartford,positive,There is good disabled parking outside the entrance.
ham house and garden richmond upon thames,positive,There are no toilets in the house. There is a accessible toilet near the shop in the garden. The toilet is spacious and has grab rails. There is an emergency alarm.
hamburger bahnhof berlin,positive,"Can't comment on parking. The Museum is in Invalidenstraße, which is well-defined by buses and trams, and is a short wheel/walk from Berlin's main railway station, the Hauptbahnhof, which is also served by the U-bahn (underground) and U-bahn (suburban railway) systems. We asked and were shown to an accessible loo by a helpful attendant, who unlocked it. It was spacious & well equipped with grab rails, but had no alarm. However the attendant knew we were in there and was on hand when we left."
hamburger kunsthalle hamburg,negative,"There are several pay car parks nearby, and the Gallery is right opposite the main train station - so plenty of public transport.  We came by mobility scooter (and foot) from the hotel, so cannot say how accessible the parking etc actually is"
hamburger kunsthalle hamburg,positive,"Only one accessible toilet in each building.  The one I visited was step-free, roomy, with grab rails and sign posted from the cafe.  "
hamerton zoo park steeple gidding,negative,Bit gravelly in the car park. Couldn't see any marked disabled spaces but there was space to drop off disabled guests by the entrance.
hamilton bus station spt hamilton,negative,There is parking next to the bus station however we did not visit this area. This is a good few minutes walk for someone with a disability.  There is also a Taxi rank on the far away side of the station we did visit the Taxi rank and it had a number of car able to take wheelchairs. However we did not visit the train station area.
hamilton bus station spt hamilton,positive,There is one accessible wheelchair toilet this is located on the closed in side of the bus station next to the ticket office and shop. The disabled access toilet is next to the main toilets. It can be opened with a Radar key and is off a good size and there was room for a carer if required. What was impressive was the fact that it had two SOS Buttons one at a  good level for someone in a wheelchair and the other at floor level. this looked a much better idea than the red cords that get tied up all the time.
hamilton hall london,negative,"Zillions of buses swarm near and around Liverpool St Station, and you should be able to get ramp assistance when arriving and departing from the station. The tube at this station is almost hopeless for step-free access: the only part of it you can use step-free is the Circle/Met Line Eastbound. "
hamilton hall london,positive,"There is a decent accessible toilet, opened with a RADAR key, and if you don't have one the staff will open it for you. The only problem with this otherwise good toilet is that there's a large bin in the wheelchair transfer area. This is very thoughtless and unhelpful. This area is not free space for storage of large objects like bins. It's the place where wheelchair users park to transfer to the toilet. "
hamilton water palace hamilton,negative,Only two disabled parking spaces which are very small and have no hatchings. They are only slightly bigger than the standard spaces but there is not nearly enough spaces and they are very poor. You end up having to park virtually on the line on one side to be able to get a wheelchair in and out which wouldn’t leave the neighbouring vehicle to do the same. They are often full even when the centre is not too busy.
hampden park stadium glasgow,negative,"Not big enough, was a very tight squeeze , disabled toilets need to be bigger taking into account different sized wheelchairs (some motorised ones much longer than standard ). To small for me and carer, it was a portoloo. Hard if you have large chair Terrible experience at the shields road accessible transport pick up. Getting there was an effort with terrible signage. Eventually seen a sign saying second left, so took it, only to go down it and get sent back as that was the exit. Had to go out onto main road again and in entrance only to find I am parked 10 ft away from where I entered originally, separated by a row of cones which could've been lifted to make life easier. Leaving Hampden was chaos, no one directing you to the shuttle buses for the different accessible parking areas. I felt that the disabled transport system for the games could have been planned better for the disabled visitors . The toilets were to small for wheelchairs"
hampden park stadium glasgow,positive,"Got parked at venue near entrance, traffic terrible on exit At the part of the stadium I was located was porta loos which were kept very clean and were spaciously designed inside. There is blue badge parking at the stadium and there was a very large section held back for blue badge holders. The reporter lives right next to the accessible platform. Couldn't fault it! We were very apprehensive beforehand as hadn't travelled that route on a match day before. We went via Glasgow Central and then Mount Florida. Helpful staff at each point. On way back the mounted police directed us to the accessible entrance to Mount Florida station (which also meant we skipped the queue - hurrah!). From Mount Florida it's only a short distance to Hampden.   Re parking - a pal always travels by car and there is a decent sized blue badge car park at Hampden. Decent accessible loos. Could do with a couple more."
hampton by hilton dundee,positive,We parked in the designated space at the door Easy to find from reception and restaurant
hampton by hilton oxford oxford,positive,"Reasonable drive to get to hotel, then 3 disabled bays available quite close to entrance, and then all areas on the level. Nice big disabled public toilet with enough room to use all chairs and spin around in there, with grab rails and pull cord."
hampton by hilton york,negative,"I had forgotten to check out disabled parking so some of this is my fault, but no-one on reception had any idea where there were any disabled parking bays other than 5+minute walk away from hotel, which, after a long drive - 5.5 hours - was just too far.  There are NO DISABLED parking spaces near the hotel.    I contacted York City council who were BRILLIANT and discovered there's an enormous parking building with unlimited FREE disabled parking less than a minute away.  0/10 for reception. Loo on ground floor was ok, cleaner than our bedroom wet-room. 3/10"
hampton by hilton york,positive,"The hotel has no parking but blue badge holders can park on the street outside around the clock. For non-blue badge holders, there is an NCP car park at the bottom of the hill 100 yards. There is an accessible toilet on the reception floor which we did not use but would expect to match the high standard throughout. Didn't use any other loo except the one in our room."
hampton court castle gardens parkland leominster,negative,"The disabled parking is in the section of the grounds next to the entrance , which is via the gift shop. It is a flat area of grass with some compacted gravel areas."
hampton court castle gardens parkland leominster,positive,"The large disabled toilets are next to the restaurant. It has grab rails on the door and walls, a drop down toilet frame and a detachable raised toilet seat. It has enough room to manoeuvre a wheelchair and for an attendant to go in with you. There are more toilets available between the car park and entrance, but these have 3 steps up to the door and are quite narrow inside.    "
hampton court palace east molesey,negative,"There are a number if disabled toilets. The toilets nearest to the carpark (M and F) are large and have excellent hand dryer in good position. However, the disabled toilet door in the restaurant could not be accessed without assistance. All were clean. The disabled loo in the main men's toilets had obviously been modified and was tiny!  There was no room for a wheelchair and a person to transfer to the toilet and once there the sink was so close to the toilet that my legs were squeezed between the sink and the toilet seat. The only issues we encountered were some unavoidable steps on sections of the underground, a train strike that meant a much reduced service, a packed and crushed train service which ended up only going half way then a bus. This was the same in return. At Hampton Court no Access issues. Normally the train station at Hampton Court is 450m, but the bus a 261 stopped right outside the gate. There were a reasonable number of accessible spaces, 8 or 9 I think and parking for blue badge holders was free. We arrived pretty promptly after opening time and had no problem parking at all, but apparently it was an unusually quiet day. It was a short walk to the ticket office."
hampton court palace east molesey,positive,"There are 8 Bluebadge parking spaces on a first come basis. Parking is free and system must recognise car registration number as barrier automatically lifts as you depart without payment More than adequate size, fully equipped. It was relatively easy to find and was in very good condition and really clean. It was possibly a little narrow for wider chairs, but generally very good."
hamsa krakow,positive,"The road parallel to the restaurant is a main road which has trams running along. I didn't use the tram while I was there so unable to comment, apart from I noticed that the new trams had wheelchair signs by one of the doors."
hamsterley forest bishop auckland,negative,There are several car parks in the forest - our route took in five. All charged apart from the one we used- £4 a day at time of writing. Didn't see anything about blue badge concessions.  Don't think buses come here.  Saw only one disabled parking space and that was by the loo at the visitor centre. However the loo was some way from the cafe/centre.
handmade burger co edinburgh,positive,"Parking in the multi storey car park is easy and not too far away. Arriving by bus drops you off just outside the shopping centre doors and large lifts, there are several, take you up to the second floor. An accessible loo which was fine. Small ramp to get up to the toilet level."
handmade burger co glasgow,positive,Plenty of car parks with numerous disabled spaces. 
hanoi bike shop glasgow,negative,"Walked here from Byres Road, about 2 minutes walk.  Tarmac road, taxi's where going up and done it. Subway was about a 7 minute walk away. "
hanoi bike shop glasgow,positive,It was great to see an accessible loo in such a restaurant. Clean and not cluttered.
harajuku kitchen edinburgh,positive,I went by car and parked with blue badge 20 metres away on Gillespie Crescent  
harbour city burton waters,negative,"3 spaces in car park bout 50m away, then long flat path past the boats ( enjoyable) if the weathers nice"
harbourmaster hotel aberaeron,positive,Everything in it. Its a bit tight but I manage to turn round in it. As mentioned already it is at the end of a downward facing (albeit short) corridor.
harbourmasters house dysart,negative,There is quite a  large car park with stunning sea views over the Forth. There are disabled spaces. The only problem is that  you need to negotiate a very rough cobbled road to get to the Harbourmaster's House from the car park. There is some parking on the hill next to the Harbourmaster's House but you will need to be lucky to get a spot there.
harbourmasters house dysart,positive,"Apparently these toilets one ""Toilets of the Year 2014"" ""Beach Category"". You can see why! Nice modern, clean and spacious accessible toilet on the ground floor near to main door. Plenty of room, very clean and everything within reach."
hard rock cafe edinburgh,negative,"George Street is parallel to Princes Street which is the main shopping street in Edinburgh. Many buses and the tram runs through here. There are some drop off spots on George Street but I am not 100% sure where parking spaces are  Decent accessible toilet but let down by the stacks of highchairs outside the door and the large bin inside. If these were away it would be a 4/5. The toilet is at the back of the restaurant and is a sharp left turn which, when there are obstacles, can be a bit difficult. Inside the sink has appropriate handrails and there is a Red cord, however this was tied up when I visited and took a photo. After taking a picture I untied the cord but did not have a Red Cord Card sadly. There is no Changing Places, the nearest one would probably be at the The Booking Office pub at Waverley. If you have a blue badge....cool. Then park then park in the street! "
hard rock cafe edinburgh,positive,All good. Modern. No issues. Good rails and stuff for balance
hard rock cafe glasgow,negative,Got parked on Queen Street which has a few disabled spaces and its just a short walk to venue
hard rock cafe glasgow,positive,On Buchanan Street so a short walk from both Glasgow Central and Queen Street stations and near local bus routes as well  Accessible toilets on site 
hard rock cafe london,positive,"Smallish accessible loo, as usual I needed help with the door!"
hard rock hotel orlando,positive,Hotel water taxi and overland bus ( to the water park) both Accessible with heavy electric chair
hardwick hall chesterfield,positive,"We drove there and parked in the blue badge area, which is nearer to the entrance. The bays aren't well marked, so it was down to each individual to decide how close to park to the next car. We left plenty of space as the car next to us looked like it had side loading for a wheelchair, but when we came back for lunch, another car had squeezed in, making it tight for us and impossible for our presumed side entering neighbour. The accessible toilet was at the far end of a long corridor. I actually prefer this as it stops people using it just because they see it first. It was clean and well equipped, though too small to turn my trike round inside. The grab rails were sturdy and in the right place for me. I think there was another accessible loo but I didn't use it."
hardwick park stockton on tees,positive,Approximately 6 blue badge spaces in the car park (don't forget Durham County Council charge blue badge users for parking).
harlaw reservoir balerno,negative,"My advice would be, drive to this venue - it has a lovely big car park (plus you can only drive so far up the path). Our group got a Social Work bus to the car park and walked the rest. One in the Centre- abit rustic but large and functional. "
harlem shake new york,positive,"They had one toilet that was for everyone, it's a small place so that was fine. It was a good size, could maybe could of done with a few more grab rails. But other than that it was perfectly adequate."
harold moores records london,negative,There are no step-free stations nearby. Zillions of buses go up and down nearby Oxford Street. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area.
harold pinter theatre london,negative,"There is no, disabled toilet within the theatre itself and you have to go across the road to Pizza Express"
harris hotel tarbert,negative,"There are parking spaces right by the ramp, but these don't appear to be reserved for disabled users. A spacious well-equipped bathroom with helpful bars.  However, to get there you have to make your way through several narrow doors, which a wheelchair user would struggle to use alone."
harris hotel tarbert,positive,"Were lucky enough to park right at the door, although no designated disabled parking. On a slope which required my friends to help with my wheelchair"
harrods london,negative,"Lots of buses go past, Knightsbridge Underground Station is close by (though I don't know if that has lifts or not). I don't know about parking"
harrods london,positive,Easy to find on the store guide and by asking the many staff standing around
harrogate climbing centre harrogate,positive,This venue has its own car park directly in front of the building with plenty of room to park. We had mobility cars and Vans and had no problem at all. Clean and tidy
harrogate convention centre harrogate,positive,"We were staying at the nearby Premier Inn so travelled on foot and by wheelchair from there, although I did note that there were a couple of on-street disabled spaces on the road nearby, and disabled parking was free in the underground car park attached to the convention centre. "
harrogate library harrogate,positive,"The library is on Victoria Avenue, next to the rose garden and just off Station Parade.   Pay and display parking is available (up to two hours) on Victoria Avenue. Disabled parking spaces are available on Victoria Avenue near the library entrance.  The bus station and railway station are both situated only a few minutes walk away. The disabled toilet is situated on the ground floor, easily accessible, grab rails, large size and very clean."
hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport atlanta,negative,I saw or saw signs to an accessible toilet but didn't need it.
hartshead moor services brighouse,negative,"3 disabled parking places outside the main entrance Signed, easy to find and accessible. Basically clean but smelled."
hartys fourways airdrie,positive,Parked in restaurant car pack. No specific disabled space but overflow car pack is just next to ramp access. Did not use public transport. Disabled loo with grab rails provided. Doubles up as baby changer room.
harvester ashton moss ashton under lyne,positive,"There is a car park outside the entrance which was not particularly busy however we visiting during the afternoon, midweek. There is a tram stop behind the cinema however I haven't tried to use this."
harvester cottages kirkbridge,negative,The toilet is inside a large shower room. It is a normal toilet with no grab rails provided. Clean.
harvester cottages kirkbridge,positive,Parking is right outside door of property. Enough space for two cars.
harvester glasgow,positive,"Parking is good, with 5 or 6 disabled accessible bays. The accessible toilet is good, reasonably sized for a disabled person and their PA."
harvester livingston,positive,"As the restaurant is set at the entrance of a large shopping centre, there was lots of spaces. We found a disabled bay easily, which is a short walk to the restaurant. The accessible toilet is upstairs, which I found quite odd to begin with, but there is a platform lift to take you up. The toilet was very clean and had everything I needed. It was a little tight, but I think this was due to the position of the large bin. It was good to see there was an emergency pull cord and that it was tied up. I put a Euan's Guide card on it anyway. The door is RADAR locked, but it was open when we went to use it. "
harvey nichols edinburgh,positive,"Getting to the store by public transport was fairly easy as buses stop in St. Andrew Square. There's also a tram stop right outside the door. The Square also has some on street parking. I didn't use the accessible toilets but had a quick look to see what they're like. The one I saw was on the fourth floor and adjacent to the restaurant. It was spacious, well appointed and spotless. Drove to Omni which is a Q Park, lots of disabled bays. Couldn't tell you of public transport."
harvey nichols edinburgh forth floor restaurant edinburgh,negative,"Top floor toilet tiny and angular, could not use."
harvey nichols edinburgh forth floor restaurant edinburgh,positive,"Harvey Nics is very close to the St Andrews Tram stop. There are also bus stops nearby. My pals parked in a nearby side street - not sure where the nearest Blue Badge parking spots are. Bus routes, train, tram and on street parking nearby."
harwich international port parkstone quay,positive,"If you park your vehicle in the cruise car park, or the short term ferry car park, there are numerous disabled bays. No free parking though. In the terminal itself, the only toilets are in the small café area, which has a ramp for wheelchairs and mobility scooters. The ladies toilet only is marked as a disabled access one, so gents beware!"
hatchards piccadilly london,positive,"Green Park Station is very nearby and is fully step-free, but check before you travel because the lifts at this station are notoriously unreliable.  Many bus routes run up and down Piccadilly.   "
hatchlands park guildford,positive,The loo is in the courtyard before the slope to the cafe and shop. It's clearly marked.  It was well equipped though the shortened alarm cord was positioned to the rear of a disposal bin out of reach of someone on the floor.   The loo was clean. Also shared with baby changing so possibly in demand at peak times - only found this one loo.
hatfield house hatfield,negative,"Toilets are in the Stable Yard, there are no public toilets in the house."
hatfield house hatfield,positive,On the day we visited there was adequate Disabled Parking Spaces.
hatfield railway station hatfield,negative,"The only negative comment I have is the ""drop off / pick up"" area. We were in hurry as were the other folk being dropped off and it's not that easy for several cars to be there together. Parking is nearby though if needed. And there are lots of buses that serve the station."
hatherley manor hotel and spa gloucester,positive,"A few car spaces available alongside the Spa, after driving past and around to the side of the Hotel itself, but then there is nothing here to inspire you to think what a lovely place. Although no actual disabled bays all area is close to hotel entrance, and easy enough to get into reception area.  "
hatton locks cafe warwick,positive,A disabled bay is available next to cafe or there are more spaces in the first public car park you come to. The walk to the café is accessible for wheelchair or scooter. Room in the disabled toilet meant I could turn around easily to lock door and to drive out forwards in my manual wheelchair and use the sink and hand drier.
hatton shopping village warwick,negative,"We did not see any toilets, we suppose they must be by restaurants, so we cannot advise you on these"
haughhead stables innerleithen,positive,There is a small carpark very nearby but I was able to be dropped off on the yard. It’s a road for access and there’s a large concrete area for being on the yard. 
hauxley wildlife discovery centre morpeth,negative,"Parking is good, it is out of the way for public transport though."
hawkhill community centre alloa,positive,My mum & dad drove & parked right outside They're was everything
hawkshead brewery kendal,negative,"Car park was fine on the day, but it can get very busy. Very limited public transport options, fairly typical for a small rural area. The local station is about half a mile away and is definitely not accessible! "
hawkshead brewery kendal,positive,"One disabled loo on thee ground floor, I had no issues getting to it, and there were plenty of handholds and rails."
hawksmoor seven dials london,positive,We took a bus to Covent Gardens earlier In the day and then later walked to Seven Dials Hawksmoor. There is a disabled toilet.  See photo 
hayes garden world ambleside,negative,Large car park with just 2 disabled spaces at south entrance . A few more at the other entrance.  It's a walk from Ambleside centre and it's uphill from Ambleside pier.  Good clean loo but it's a long way from the cafe.  It's the other end of the building downstairs.  Slope down to toilets means a slope back up. You need to be confident if propelling yourself . 
hayes garden world ambleside,positive,"Large loo, handrails plentiful, wheelchair level wanna basin and hand dryer"
hayling billy cycle trail hayling island,negative,We drove. The Hayling Halt car park is loose large gravel that the car boot scooter couldn’t cope with. We had to park blocking a gate to unload the scooter directly onto the path.
haymarket edinburgh,negative,City centre location with paid parking on neighbouring streets. 
haymarket edinburgh,positive,The accessible loo is located at the opposite side of the bar to the access entrance. It is a good size with plenty of room for bigger wheel/power chairs. There is also a baby changing facility and an emergency cord by the loo.  
haymarket hub hotel edinburgh,positive,"There is a small car park located at the back of the hotel which guests are able to use based on a first come first served basis. The hotel is a very close wheel away from the Train Station (Haymarket) Bus & Tram links, there is also a taxi rank nearby should you prefer to take a cab, its one of the reasons I choose to stay there so frequently."
haymarket railway station edinburgh,negative,"Parking here can be an issue, however there is a taxis rank, and the buses and trams both drop off here."
haymarket railway station edinburgh,positive,"Clean and warm. There is a red alarm cord and it was at floor level when we visited. There's room to park a wheelchair at one side of the toilet if a side transfer is called for. There are grab rails by the loo and the wash basin. The only reason we aren't giving this five stars is that the hand-dryer is on the opposite wall to the wash basin, and there are no grab rails anywhere near it. Can't think why they didn't put the hand-dryer next to the wash basin and its grab rails. Large accessible loo on the main concourse. It has a RADAR lock.

hays galleria london,positive,Several of the eateries have accessible loos and there is a good public accessible loo a short distance away near Southwark Court.
head of steam   darlington railway museum darlington,positive,"We parked in the car park, we could have parked just outside the museum but the signage was non existent, we have spoken to a staff member who said she would review the situation. The loo was well signposted, plenty of room for a mobility scooter and carer, there were grab rails and it was clean."
headingley cricket ground leeds,positive,The loos are big enough but like so many - obstructed internally by plastic bins. 
headingley enterprise and arts centre heart leeds,positive,"The car park has multiple disabled parking spaces, and there are several bus stops nearby. The surrounding pavements have steep curb drops and potholes which can make pedestrian access problematic. There are multiple disabled toilets, including at least one on the ground floor that has full changing facilities available."
headrow house leeds,negative,"No dedicated car park, but disabled parking bays are available within a 1 mile radius. There are several nearby bus stops, including the bus station, and the train station is not far too. I didn't use them during my visit, but they almost certainly lack full changing facilities, and probably had to make the most of a small space."
heads of ayr farm park ayr,positive,Quite a tight car park to get around in a fairly big mobility car but the disabled bays were right at the entrance and roomy.
healeys cornish cyder farm truro,negative,We travelled by private car.  There are some disabled spaces but they are not particularly wide.

heart of the shires northampton,positive,"After arriving along a lovely driveway, we reached the designated disabled parking area, with 9 bays available, all very close to the main entrance and from here on it’s all on the level. Although outside along the courtyard by exit, it was Handel placed, but we did not actually use the toilet, but assume that with everything else carefully thought out, we feel it would be very useful."
heartwood forest st albans,negative,"There was abundant parking, in mown fields, being chalk down land the surface was adequate for my mobility scooter."
heath view holiday bungalow ipswich,positive,"Large wetroom shower-room with plenty of space for 2 carers. Plenty of off road parking on the driveway, all even surface and good for wheelchair users/ double bedroom with wet room, shower seat.  Emergency pull cord with alarm outside the bedroom door."
heathergems pitlochry,positive,"Parking for disabled right outside the main entrance to the right of the door,  From the Main road you can drive right up and park right outside entrance.  There are a couple of disabled spaces.  All parking is free."
heatherhall wood cupar,negative,"Although there is one official car park, there are a few other non designated parking areas which offer better access to the main paths which are suitable for wheelchairs and scooters. As this is countryside location the car park surfaces are not tarmacked. "
heathrow airport london,positive,"Did not use, but one of our group said that they were fully accessible, provisioned and well serviced. There were disabled loos that had RADAR key entrance. Excellent and well directed signage."
heathrow airport longford,negative,"The disabled toilet at Heathrow airport is okay as it has two handrails at either side, however it is also a baby changing room so you can get quite small with the other equipment in there."
heathrow airport longford,positive,Accessible toilets are generally excellent I went by car to get to Heathrow it is a 45 to 50 minutes journey to the airport. There is disabled parking at Heathrow airport in the car park with quite a few spaces and you're able to get space very often.
heaton park manchester,positive,The golf course car park is best for wheelchairs There is an accessible toilet at the petting farm but take a key as i forgot mine and they did not have one although the normal toilets were big enough to get my chair in

heeley retail park sheffield,positive,Disabled spaces are available in various places across the car park. There are bus stops just outside the car park but no tram stops are nearby.
helensburgh central railway station helensburgh,negative,"Bus stop just outside the station. Parking can be difficult though if travelling by car Central Station is in the town, so many people reach it on foot or by bike.  There is a bus stop directly outside.  There is also a taxi rank on the street outside.   There is a small car park within the station, which has a couple of marked disabled bays. This car park does tend to fill up quite quickly though.   There is a car-park slightly further along E. Prince's St, on the opposite side of the road.   There is some parking available in the Co-op supermarket car park behind the station (short term parking of a few hours) or for a longer period upstairs in this car-park, but this isn't really accessible.  There is also some parking available on surrounding streets, but most of this is for a limited time period, so make sure you check the signs.    There is an accessible toilet in the station - it is the only toilet in the station, so can be used by anyone, but only at station staffs discretion.  It is not that obvious where the toilet  is - if coming from the East Princes St entrance, it is along the wall at the opposite side of the station. The toilet is locked (not by a radar key) and you must ask a member of staff to let you use it. When I asked, they checked I had a train ticket and that I was travelling, before letting me use it.   You go through one door from the station platforms, there is a small (unused) room, before another door into the toilet. These are standard doors, not automatic or push button, but have a support-type handle on the back. They are quite wide doors, so I think most people in wheelchairs would get through without difficulty.  The toilet is a large space, plenty of room for a carer if you needed one.  The facilities were clean.   There was a red cord but it didn't reach anywhere near the floor.  When you are finished you are to tell the member, so they can lock the door again. "
helensburgh helensburgh,negative,"There is an accessible toilet (and standard toilets) at the top of the pier - just beside the carpark.  The accessible toilet can be opened only with a radar key.  I did not use this, so cannot detail further.  "
helensburgh helensburgh,positive,"Helensburgh Central Train Station is located within the town, next to the shops etc and is only two streets along from Colquhoun Square.  Trains link directly to both Glasgow and Edinburgh.  There are local buses.  The nearest car park is the pier car park - there are marked disabled bays at the top of the car park (near where the swimming pool is).  If you don't have a blue badge, it is worth knowing that you have to pay for standard parking in the top half of the car park...but parking is free if you go to the bottom of the carpark!  There is also street parking, with some marked disabled bays. Most streets have time limits of how long you can be parked there."
helensburgh seafront helensburgh,negative,"There is an accessible toilet, which requires a radar key to use, at the top of the pier. Alongside male and female toilets. At time of writing, these were all closed due to coronavirus procedures.   The cafe at Kids on Park has a toilet located on the outside of its premises, which anyone can use for a charge of 30p. I don't believe this to be an accessible toilet, but was unable to check as this was also closed at time of writing.  "
helensburgh seafront helensburgh,positive,"Helensburgh Central Station takes you into the centre of town, from there you can walk/roll straight down Sinclair Street to the seafront. This train line goes straight to Glasgow and Edinburgh.  There are local buses (which stop outside the train station, or near colquhoun Square).  The Pier has the towns main car park. There are marked disabled bays as long the very top wall. Otherwise, it's useful to know that parking is free for everyone at the bottom part of the carpark (nearest the water) but there is a charge for parking at the top.  There is also street parking, with some disabled bays. Beware though of different streets having different lengths of times which you can park.   Alternatively, at the opposite end of this walk, at the West end of Helensburgh, there is a small car park at Kidson Park. This is an unmarked, free carpark. "
helsey house cottages skegness,positive,"Parking just outside cottage Parking is no more than 12 foot from the front door The toilet can be fitted with a higher seat and there is plenty of room for a wheelchair there is a shower with a ramp for easy access a bath and a sink as well as the toilet The parking is just outside the cottages which is very convenient for loading and unloading. The spacious bathroom has a wide door and wet floor for easy access. The loo and shower  has a hand rail for support. We drove to Helsey House Cottages and parked outside the cottage. There is ample parking spaces outside the cottage.  There are only two cottages on the property and the main house. The bathroom and loo are combined.  There is a raise seat on the loo.  The door into the bathroom is big and can accommodate a wheelchair easily, the bathroom itself is huge; has a walk in shower, no steps to get into it, has hand rails, there is also a bath tub, and a hand rail next to the toilet."

here internet cafe edinburgh,negative,"There is disabled Access parking in the area although this is a very busy area of the city. The bus routes are by 8 different services right in front of the cafe southbound and directly across the road northbound. A large heavy metal door witha step takes you to an outside yard, it’s cold accessible but basic."
herges on the loch galashiels,positive,"Tweedbank Station is close by (an easy and flat walk). I am sure that there is good disabled parking but we didn't use it. Accessible Loo is very easy to find, is large and well-equipped."
heriot watt university student union edinburgh,positive,"The accessible loo is easily found on the Ground Floor opposite Geordies (and next to ""Stone Willy's Pizza""). This is a typical 1990s accessible loo, so features grab rails (poor contrast with wall), a sink reachable from the toilet (no automatic or mixer tap) and paper towels (not accessible from toilet).  It should be noted that there is also baby changing in this loo and sanitary bins. There is no advertised Changing Places or Space to Change facility in the venue, or, within the Campus."
hermiston gait retail park edinburgh,positive,"Accessible parking bays are located adjacent to each of the stores. If you are arriving by public transport you can choose from accessible buses, the railway services, and the tram service. All three are within 50 metres of the corner of the retail park. Accessible toilets are located in both B and Q as well as in the large Tesco store."
hermitage of braid blackford hill edinburgh,positive,"There is limited free parking by the main gates to the pond and more up on both side of Charterhall Road.   The 38 bus joins Cluny Gardens with Morningside and stops outside the gates. The 24 & 41 stop at the post office in Blackford Avenue, from there it is a 5 to 10 minute walk or two stops on a 38 on the far side of Charterhall Road. There are ringing traffic lights with drop down kerbs at both Blackford Avenue and Cluny Gardens.  There isn't a cafe so take a picnic from home or pick something up in Morningside or at the Avenue Store opposite the post office. Remember to take all your leftovers home, to reduce the vermin problem."
heron foods york,negative,"There is disabled parking available at the front of the store, however, there are limited places. There is no easy to find/ accessible loo, but again a staff member would allow use of their toilet when asked."
herongate wood brentwood,negative,"You cannot get here by public transport as it is on a country lane. There is a large car park and one nearer the hall of remembrance for disabled users, but it at least needs raking to smooth out the shingle or preferably a paved path or plastic walkway. The general toilets are easily accessible but the disabled toilet is in the hall of remembrance and you will need one of the helpful members of staff to open the hall for you. There is no red cord in the toilet, or soap come to that."
hest bank hotel lancaster,positive,"The pub has of road parking which is easy accessible and a 2 second walk to the pub, it also has road parking. it is in the centre of the village so a prime location for people to get to. it is situated on the canal so passers by have easy access.  The loo is in walking distance for all seating areas, with no steps or uneven flooring it is suitable for any user. "
het genot van grootschermer grootschermer,positive,"There is a free parking area located across from the restaurant.  The street the restaurant is located on is on a narrow street.  If being dropped off at the entrance, be sure to watch for cars that occasionally pass through. A fully accessible toilet is located inside the entrance of the restaurant"
het touwmuseum oudewater,negative,"The museum is best reached by car or taxi. The company Accessible Travel Netherlands can arrange a taxi for you if needed.  If going by public transportation, Oudewater has no train station, but is reachable by bus from the larger surrounding cities.  Be sure to call ahead to ensure all buses you will be traveling on are accessible."
het touwmuseum oudewater,positive,There is an accessible toilet with handrails installed.
hetland garden centre dumfries,positive," A few minutes of the main A75 Euroroute,we travelled by car, plenty of dedicated accessible parking spaces near the entrance.  Clean fresh accessible toilets. Plenty of room to manoeuvre , plenty of grabrails. Easy to find, well sign posted. Room for a carer, but no help cord in place"
hetland hall hotel carrutherstown,negative,"There is no disabled parking which I seen. So being a wheelchair user, I need room to get out and back into my car and have the confidence that no one will park next to me to obstruct me getting back into my car. I parked down at the main car park and there is no drop curd to get up onto the pavement. They do have a very small movable ramp to get up onto the pavement but caution is advised as someone could easily tip out of their chair when using it. Accessible toilets in the function area, however I’m not sure what a person is to do if they are just having a meal or staying at the hotel how there meant to access the toilet when a function is actually on! Gate crash it 🤦🏻‍♂️"
hetland hall hotel carrutherstown,positive,"No designated disabled parking, main Carpark at front of hotel, plenty parking, wheelchair access at rear of hotel, and further parking available there, but no signage to reflect this. Had to ask where accessible toilet was, this involved a long trail through hotel, and through function room to access. Would have been too far for someone with mobility restrictions. However toilet is newly refurbished, very roomy, plenty of grabrails, toilet a little low though. If I was visiting the bar or restaurant, and there was a function ongoing such as a wedding, I would have felt uncomfortable having to pass through function room. The hotel is undergoing an extensive refurbishment, so perhaps they have plans for an accessible toilet in the public rooms area of hotel. We travelled by car, it’s out in the country, the public bus service passes the road end, but it’s a good half mile uphill up a drive to access. No dedicated accessible parking spaces, we had to park over 2 spaces to leave room for chair  Hotel has had a refurbishment, so pleased to see they now have an accessible loo in public areas, before you had to get a member of staff to take you through the reception room to an accessible loo. Loo was roomy with plenty of grab rails etc."
hever castle hever,positive,"There are no buses to Hever Castle and the nearest station is a mile away, but road access is good and there's ample blue badge parking close to the main buildings (show your badge when you buy your tickets at the entrance and they'll open the gate to let you down the drive). Had to wait a bit for a baby-changing family to come out of the accessible loo at the Moat Restaurant, but it was quite clean and spacious inside. We drove and on arrival told the car park attendant that I needed to use a wheelchair. He directed us into the castle grounds so we could park very close to the entrance which was really helpful. The disabled parking is totally seperate from the main car park. If you alert the attendant on your arrival they allow you to drive up to the Entrance Booth where you can pay the entrance fee, then drive up the walkway to within 30 metres of the shop/cafe where they have designated blue badge parking. For those without a blue badge, they do run a small bus/cart that will take those with difficulty walking up the main driveway - you do need to ask for this service. Accessible toilets in the cafe"
heworth post office york,positive,Public Parking spaces outside but no specifically disabled parking.  Bus stop also just outside
hexham old gaol hexham,negative,"There's no parking,  disabled or otherwise.  We got dropped off at the front door.  There aren't any.  But many in the local town. "
hibernian fc club store edinburgh,positive,It's possible to park right outside on the street. Short distance to the entrance. On street parking right outside the door. Level access into the store.
hibernian learning centre edinburgh,positive,"Parking is available near to the entrance with plenty of space to embark and only a short distance to the entrance. The accessible toilet has a wide door, turning space, grab rails and the features you would expect."
hidelow house bed and breakfast acton beauchamp,positive,"Designated parking outside each of the properties . We stayed at Hidelow house which sleeps 4 . Wet room with grab handles, adjustable shower. shower seat as requested on booking. Toilet which had a raised seat and grab bars."
hifi club leeds,positive,"In the middle of town so it's easy to get to, and there is parking in the Corn Exchange car park which is a couple of minutes walk. "
high barn cottages bridlington,positive,"Lots of parking. You can park near the cottage for loading/unloading. We were in The Spinney - slight problem with the shower being a fixed overhead type which is an issue when using a shower stool - you can't avoid the initial cold water or avoid wetting your hair, but the owners are thinking of adding a non-fixed shower, plus other cottages of theirs have this already. A few more grabrails would have been good in the bathroom. Driving very easy. Parking secure behind electronic gates. Parking on gravel but easy access to flat paved area."
high corner inn ringwood,negative,"Although parking is fine in the sizeable car park, there are no blue badge spaces and the surface is rough (it's a large clearing in the Forest). Its not a problem but just be aware that the ground isn't perfectly smooth, especially on foot. It's off the beaten track so driving is essential. We walked/wheeled from another car park so we got out into the Forest - the Inn is a great watering hole mid way through a walk."
high corner inn ringwood,positive,"Nice and clean, spacious, rails etc. Toilet sign was clear."
high force waterfall forest in teesdale,negative,There is a toilet in the car park. Unfortunately I didn't use it so can't comment on it. There is an accessible toilet in the car park but it is basic and not that clean. I used our own in the motorhome instead.
high force waterfall forest in teesdale,positive,"We arrived by motorhome the night before and stayed over in the car park. If you order a meal, you can stay overnight for free but you have to book in advance and let hotel reception know your registration number. The car park is nice and flat with stunning views in every direction."
high lodge thetford,positive,"There is plenty of parking in the disabled car park adjacent to the venue - follow the signs and the stewards' directions on arrival at the site. This is not limited to Blue Badge holders, but the info states that priority will be given to them. This car park is approx. 250 metres from the arena entrance along a mixture of forest paths and tarmac. There is an accessible toilet at the brick-built toilet block in the visitor centre / box office. There is another within the arena area, adjacent to the viewing platform; this is a fairly basic ""portaloo""-style toilet, a bit cramped for wheelchair users, with just about enough room for side transfer, and rails on the walls. There is a lot of parking but on holidays and school holidays it can get very busy and disabled parking is quite limited. The car parks are spread out amongst the trees connected by paths which are unsaved but are not generally muddy .  The disabled parking is the same but much closer to the central point where you can reach toilets, cafe etc.   You do have to pay for parking. There are automatic plate readers entering the forest and machines to pay before you leave.  Plenty of parking but there is limited Blue Badge spaces. The car parks are not tarmaced but there is some hard standing . The car parks are vast so if you cannot get the Blue Badge space you can be parked some distance away. "
high wycombe shopmobility high wycombe,positive,Blue badge outside parking or park in Eden car park level 2 purple zone Easy access in shop
highclere castle newbury,positive,A huge car park with plenty of space for disabled parking.(Gravel surface)Only a short walk to the house on tarmac road. I don't think it is served by public transport but there were plenty of coach parties there.
highcross leicester,positive,"The shopping centre has its own parking facilities which is the John Lewis car park. There are 107 Blue Badge parking bays available which are clearly marked across the different levels of the car park.   There is a bus stop within 150 metres of the shopping centre. The nearest train station is Leicester, which is a ten-minute walk away from the shopping centre, however there are also frequent buses to and from the station.   There are several disabled toilets throughout the shopping centre, that offer ‘changing places’, this provides additional space and facilities, such as a changing table. The toilets can be easily accessed from the main shopping centre, and the other is on the ground floor.  One main criticism in terms of the toilets is that for them to be accessed you have to have a key, which has to be obtained by the Customer Services Lounge or by a contact number which is on the door. This is not practical and could appear confusing for someone who is blind or cannot read. Additionally, if someone is in desperate need of the toilet this is not appropriate and could result in an accident.  Another drawback is the toilet doors are quite heavy. In addition to this there is a mirror, however it is not placed at a lower level or at an angle of ease to use. "
highland folk museum newtonmore,negative,There was a big car park.  The toilets were clean and tidy. 
highland folk museum newtonmore,positive,"Plenty of spacious disabled parking spaces. Excellent space and access but red cord tied to a handle :( There is adequate parking outside the building for disabled parking, or minibuses. There is also a large car park for the whole Folk Park, so people could be dropped at the door and then vehicles moved to large carpark if necessary. All toilets are a good size and brightly lit. Nobody had any complaints. Directly beside the main road. Disabled parking close to the entry office. Entry is free to everyone. Mainline train station at Kingussie is three miles from the venue. Main line Bus service close by. Fully accessible disabled toilets with long gentle ramps to these disabled toilets"
highland liliums beauly,negative,"We've had to give a low score here as there aren't buses directly to here and it is a fair bit out of the nearest village bus stop, so unless you have a car, it would probably not be viable.  The parking itself however, was fine with plenty of space and in the actual venue."
highland liliums beauly,positive,"The car park is on site and even has a generosity box for fresh eggs if you want them; although there are no specific disabled spaces, it’s so quiet out there that you wouldn’t have any problem accessing a space, and if you did, I’m sure the staff would try to find you a parking space.  As it's in the country, you would have to drive or take a bus to the next village of Kiltarlity but it's a bit too far to walk or wheel if you have mobility difficulties."
highland wildlife park kingussie,positive,"Good sized car park, and a good drop off point if you're not driving yourself. We got a taxi as neither of us had a car, and it was a very simple (if slightly pricey) way to do it, and we weren't the only ones! It meant we didn't drive our own car around the safari, but instead jumped in one of the park's jeeps for a tour. These jeeps are very high to get into, but they provide a step whether you request one or not.  Easy parking but narrow spaces. I parked adjacent to the restaurant, shop and disabled toilets The disabled toilet is visible on entry to the main building. It is well equipped with space for a carer. There is also a disabled toilet outside close to the play area. Disabled car parking is available within a few yards of the visitor centre  There is a disabled toilet at the reception. It is big and spacious. There is also a disabled toilet outside the play area.  "
hightide holiday cottage southwold,positive,"The cottage has parking space for one vehicle by the front entrance, and for another two vehicles at the rear, behind a gate. On the ground floor, accessed from the hall corridor, there is an accessible toilet and wet room, with a ceiling track hoist leading across the corridor to the single bedroom. The toilet has a fixed rail on the left, and a drop-down rail on the right. There is a very small sink, supposedly at wheelchair height, although we found it too small for any practical use. The wet room also contains a drop-down shower table. It does lack a wheeled shower/commode chair, which would have been very useful - there is a small chair that could be placed in the shower, but it is low and has no arm rails. We did encounter some problems with the ceiling track hoist. It tended to stick at various points, and needed some pushing and pulling to get it moving again. There seemed to be a particular issue where the track divided to go either to the shower or the toilet - there are cords that need to be pulled to change the track here, but the hoist always seemed to get stuck at this point when the person was raised in it."
highway garden and leisure norwich,positive,Good car park space. All tarmac . Limited blue badge spaces close to entrance but plenty of parking overall. Good sized toilet with grab bars and space for a wheelchair . No adult changing space but the whole toilet was well kept and clean .
hill lord co edinburgh,positive,"There is ample parking though this is a major route in and out of the City to the CityBypass, there are disabled parking spaces, pay bays and opportunities for blue badge holders. As said previously excellent bus service."
hill of maunderlea lodges huntly,positive,"No public transport but space for 2 cars next to each lodge on level tarmac with easy access to the door or the decking. 5 star if public transport available, though part of the benefits are that you are away from any main roads. Easy access to spacious wet room with toilet with raised seat and hand rails."
hillers farm shop alcester,positive,"Easy drive to find, a good hard laid car park area, with three disabled bays right by entrance."
hillhead bookclub glasgow,negative,Got here from the subway - 4 minute walk. Same distance from Botanics.
hillhead bookclub glasgow,positive,Good sized toilet at the front of the entrance. Well fitted out.
hillsborough castle hillsborough,positive,"Separate male & female toilets at the entrance of the garden. Very well presented with the luxury of  hand moisture in the ladies. Easy wheelchair access, although you have to come out of disabled toilet to dry your hands( but not to wash them)."
hilton at the ageas bowl southampton,negative,"The car park is across from the hotel access is via a keypad code which you get when checking in,it is fairly small so not ideal really.I do not know if the hotel is served by public transport it is situated a bit out of the way."
hilton brighton metropole brighton,positive,"There is a drop off layby at the front of the hotel with double yellow lines so not abused by non-blue badge holders as a general parking bay. There is a drop kerb directly in front of the entrance and ramp access to one side. The hotel has its own car park but the daily charge of £20 is, in my opinion, excessive, even if in keeping with local commercial car parks. Brighton has excellent free 24hr Blue Badge parking and there are bays immediately around the corner at the top of Cannon Place. See http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/parking-and-travel/parking/disabled-parking The accessible toilets for both public use and in guest rooms are of a good size and well fitted. Some, as in our room, are yet to be fully refurbished and consequently showing signs of wear, although perfectly serviceable."
hilton cambridge city centre cambridge,positive,A large multistorey grand arcade carpark is next door. Good accessable toilet with plenty of room .
hilton coylumbridge coylunbridge,negative,Not enough disabled parking - only 4 spaces Our room did not have an accessible bathroom  The toilets are far to small in the entrance area
hilton coylumbridge coylunbridge,positive,Plenty of parking and you can get a bus or taxi straight from Aviemore train station to the hotel. 
hilton edinburgh carlton edinburgh,negative,"As there is very little city centre parking near this hotel, we decided to go by foot (and wheel!) Although a lovely walk through Edinburgh's city centre and may people offered us help and support, the steep hills proved extremely difficult for us to manage! "
hilton edinburgh carlton edinburgh,positive,Gorgeous accessible bathrooms that do not compromise form for function.  And they had mirrors too (a rarity in accessible bathrooms!)
hilton edinburgh grosvenor edinburgh,positive,"The hotel is in a busy street not too far from Haymarket railway station (300 metres). There’s limited parking in the area.  If you are arriving from the airport or on the train, it’s a good spot. The hotel is a short distance from the train station, tram stop and bus interchange.  Taxis can drop at the door and there are plenty of taxis at the nearby rank at the station. There is an accessible toilet to the rear of the reception area. For me, as a visually impaired person, public transport is important. The hotel is a short distance from the railway station at Haymarket; as well as the tram stop and bus interchange.  Taxis can drop off and pick up at the front door. There is an accessible toilet near to the reception area. On street parking is available outside and it is also a short 2 minute walk from Haymarket station Rooms are available with accessible toilets and there is a ground floor accessible toilet in the reception area"
hilton garden inn aberdeen,negative,"Had an issue upon arrival as staff members had parked in accessible parking bay, they did offer to move but i had parked on street which was free for blue badge holders.  There is a private car park below the hotel itself, which can be booked along with your room. It does have accessible spaces too. I was too late booking to get a room, but I later found out that the height limit for cars in the car park is 2 meters, so I wouldn't have fit in anyway with my roof box on. There is the opportunity to park on street around the block, but it can be difficult to find a space in busy periods.  The accessible loo in my room did have everything I needed and was spacious enough, but the red pull cord was tied to the ceiling, which let it down quite a bit. I also had to call reception to ask for a shower chair to be delivered, but the staff were more than happy to help with this."
hilton garden inn aberdeen,positive,Ask to book disabled car parking space when making reservation On lower ground floor but easily accessible via lifts. As a manual wheelchair user it had everything required.
hilton garden inn glasgow,negative,We did drive but the car park is on cobbles. Even using an area to get close to the back of the hotel The wheel chair still had to go over cobbles also to gain access to a taxi we thought would be easier we still had to go over cobbles. The wheelchair was badly da aged and I had to get Glasgow wheelchair services to come out as a private contractor could not fix problem. The hotel also did not have a ramp available for the front steps either. Also the main automated accessible doors were not working I was advised to push them but have limited projection in my chair so could not self propel. Large car park adjacent to the hotel but only one disabled space allocated close to the flat paving stones which run around the hotel many other parking spaces but this means crossing uneven cobbles. There are bus stops not far from the hotel and many taxis passing regulate.
hilton garden inn glasgow,positive,Accessible toilet down small corridor adjacent to reception; large uncluttered clean toilet with appropriate grab rails etc.
hilton glasgow grosvenor glasgow,positive,We parked our car in the car park and there are 2 disabled parking bays There was a large walk in shower and alarm system in the toilet
hilton helsinki airport vantaa,positive,We flew into Helsinki airport and the hotel is approx 200yards from the entrance of arrivals well signposted and up a lift/stairs and the hotel is facing you. I am unsure where parking is etc. The toilets in the accessible rooms were a good size with plenty grab rails and wheel in showers.
hilton hotel burton upon trent,positive,"After coming off the A38, we drove for miles through countryside, getting worried we may have perhaps put in the wrong SAT NAV directions, before finally arriving at the main gates entrance fo St George’s Park (photo 1) and followed a very long but pleasant driveway (photo 2) I have never had a problem parking here. There are 13 accessible car parking spaces and I have always found one.  St George's is very near the main motorway systems. There are 4 accessible toilets which satisfy standard building regulations for accessibility. None of these have a 'changing places' facility but the FA have told me that there are plans to create one in their area which will be open to the public. For your information the FA own the Hilton but it is managed by the Hilton group. Parking is ideal, right outside the hotels entrance, with a number of disabled bays.  Disabled public toilets are in the bar lounge area, on the level, and big enough to help you cope, with grab handles and pull cord"
hilton london gatwick airport horley,negative,Not great.  Toilet was very low down and the floor was highly polished so slidey under foot.  The shower was over the bath and although the bath side was low there was no hand rails to help you in and out.
hilton london gatwick airport horley,positive,"Took the mono rail from Terminal North, easy to use, level access and runs every few minutes.  They even have dedicated wheelchair spots at the front."
hilton london heathrow airport terminal 5 slough,positive,plenty of Blue Badge spaces with smooth access to the hotel.
hilton newcastle gateshead gateshead,positive,"Used public transport, taxi from station to hotel. In the bedroom ensuite. Raised with grab rails alarms etc."
hilton stockholm slussen stockholm,positive,"Accessible toilets in and out of rooms had handrails, help cords and low down sinks and mirrors to accommodate wheelchair users. They were incredibly spacious and easy to move around in. Wet rooms were also available instead of a shower or bath which, for me, was better."
hilton the hague den haag,positive,"The five stars are for the admirable Taxi Munckhof, booked through Accessible Travel Netherlands, so got us here from the ferry terminal at Ijmuiden. They use rear access minibuses with lifts and are highly reliable. Can’t comment on the parking - there is an underground car park right next to the hotel but we didn’t use it. The nearest tram stops and bus stops are a block away, but not all trams in Den Haag are wheelchair accessible, though buses are. There’s a well-equipped and reasonably spacious wheelchair-accessible loo close to Reception. It is well-signed. Grab rails, loo paper in an accessible position, an approachable sink and alarm cord. The en-suite bathroom in our room was splendidly-equipped. Wet room shower with fold-down seat and grab rails either side, controls within reach & also a shelf for toiletries at a sensible level. The loo had grab rails on either side and there was room for side transfer, and the approachable basin had grab holes in it - see picture."
hilton york hotel york,positive,There are parking bays just outside the doorway of the hotel and parking is available for a fee. Concierges are employed to help with bags and car parking. Car park opposite and on-street parking readily available if you have a blue badge.
hindhead commons and the devils punch bowl hindhead,positive,"Parking at Devils Punchbowl excellent, disabled bays but chargeable. Highcombe muddy, unmarked but free. To rear of NT cafe. Clean, well equipped, radar key. It's a good loo (accessed from inside the cafe or from the rear of the building). Recently upgraded, it's radar key operated."
hippodrome cinema boness,negative,Can park in nearby street with blue badge but not always easy to find something close.
hirwaun village hall aberdare,positive,"There are good public transportation links, with a bus stop directly outside.  There is a fairly large sized carparks with flat access for taxi drop offs, there is two accessible parking bays in this car park.  The car park is also well lit in the evening."
his majestys theatre aberdeen,negative,"There is not really any disabled parking I think there is maybe 2 spaces round the back of the theatre but they are usually full. I usually get a taxi or get someone to drop me off if I am going as they can stop right outside the main entrance to drop off. There are also plenty of bus routes that go into the city centre near the theatre. Main mobility impaired access is via drop off at the front, but there is a 'back door' route for 30 minutes before shows start."
his majestys theatre aberdeen,positive,Again as stated before the loo is big although not handrails close enough to the toilet.
historic walls of derry londonderry,positive,There is on street parking close to the section of the walls with wheelchair access.  The bus station is a few minutes walk from the city walls.
hitchin a wyevale garden centre hitchin,positive,Around 8 disabled spaces next to entrance - i've driven there numerous times and there have always been spaces. Easily accessible near cafe. Not massive but certainly large enough for Wheelchair/Scooter.
hm edinburgh,positive,"Public transport is excellent around here. Waverley Train Station is just across the road, as are numerous taxi ranks, bus stops and tram stops."
hms unicorn dundee,positive,"We got the train into Dundee station, and the Unicorn was a 5-10 minute push from there. Easier for the members in the group with powerchairs than for those in manual chairs, but still very manageable as the surfaces were flat. I didn't notice on-street parking nearby, but the Quay is a 2 minute push across the bridge, with parking available there."
hoar cross hall burton on trent,negative,"Basically just normal everyday toilets, but best if you read part one and our details. It’s quite a way from reception along a passage to reach the disabled toilet (photo 16) and you will find its door just slightly wider than normal (photo 17) but inside it is Just a small room, beautifully tiled, with modern facilities, and grab rail. You may not get a chair in there though. "
hoar cross hall burton on trent,positive,"As explained in part one review, it’s handy as near to hotels entrance, but difficult to then get in via the ramp, as told in part one, so please read that as it shows you how to get in. It is a nice drive to get to the hotel, intriguing approach, and you can park up in disabled bays right by the hotels entrance, and it’s ramp that is needed to get you into hotel. (SEE PHOTOS 6 to 9) Disabled still enjoy the lovely driveway that approaches the hotel, but it still remains difficult to get up into hotel itself, but we believe there is another entrance to the Spa, but cannot offer any idea if of use to disabled as we did not know about other entrances."
hodnet market drayton,negative,"Both Wollerton and Hodnet were easy enough to drive to through rather dull uninteresting countryside, but both gardens offer enough parking to allow you the chance to enjoy the gardens as well as seeing Hodnet village."
hoe grange holidays brassington,negative,The toilet lacked a seat cover which was a bit of a pain.
hoe grange holidays brassington,positive,"We drove to the accommodation. The parking space was level although the site is on a hillside.  The wet room was excellent, there was a movable hand basin which allowed easier access to the wc so that our commode/shower chair could go over the toilet bowl. Parking for 2 cars directly outside the cabin on level tarmac with a gentle slope up to the entrance Wet room facilities were excellent, plenty of space, grab rails, access for shower chair over toilet. As with most people who have disabled charges we arrived in our WAV with ample parking Parking is excellent. Right next to your accommodation. Large wet room with high toilet, toilet frame and grab rails. Shower chairs and seats available. Hoe Grange has car parking right next to each cabin with ramps direct into the cabins, all very easy.  Cabin have a full wet room with shower and rails.  Disabled parking outside each home. Fold down rails by toilet and room to manoeuvre hoist and space for a carer. Can get under the sink in a wheelchair and the wet-room floor also helps. Transport was not provided. There were 2parking spaces outside the cabin. We went by car and found it easy to find. Really helpful to have parking right outside the cottage. There are 2 bathrooms in Pinder cottage. Though no hand rails, a portable stand with rails both sides was available at no extra cost. Parking directly outside on level access for two vehicles. We drove up via A1 and went via Ashbourne.   Toilet for me were excellent and has an adjustable sink so that i could both shave and brush teeth wash hands etc. Found us a space not far from the pod so that we did not have to go up the hill. Again great for us but other might require grab rails. Level parking for two cars immediately adjacent to entrance. Large wet room/toilet with shower chair provided that fits over toilet if required.. grab rails where needed, low sink, all towels and toiletries provided for our visit Outside the accomodation. A level walk of a few metres into the cabin. Plenty of parking for wheelchair accessible spaces and multiple cars. Completely accessible shower room with commode shower chair that fits over toilet. Adjustable sink and supports around the toilet. We were able to park our wheelchair accessible vehicle at the side of the log cabin and it was a level walk to the wide doorway.  A shower/commode chair was provided to suit the Closomat toilet.  Disabled parking outside the door worked well for us, even though we need space to make an exit from the passenger door. There is sufficient flat space to park but it is at the top of a steep bank. You need a car to get to Hoe Grange. Fully described with photos on the website Plenty of space to park a large WAV directly outside the property. Fully accessible facilities. The disabled parking was right outside the  cabin and there was plenty of room for two cars. The accessible toilet was ideal with the rails either side.    Good level parking Fully level accessible shower en suite , ample space and appropriately adjustable wash basin. Plenty of grab rails."
hog hedge whiddon down okehampton,positive,"There are a few disabled spaces close to the entrance. The carpark is tarmacked.  The disabled toilet is a reasonable size. It's cleaner than toilets at most British services. It has grab rails, a suitable bin and a changing table (though it's unsuitable for anyone larger than a small child)."
hogarths hotel solihull,positive,"Coming off a main countryside road, a long driveway led to the riding school, before a scenic tree lined avenue took us towards the car park area.  A wheelchair lift takes you down to disabled toilet, which is very clean with all mod cons, and has pull cord and grab handles. You will be able to get in quite easily and spin around in there."
hogarths stone manor hotel kidderminster,positive,"A short driveway takes you to parking bays, at least 4 bays available, and one electric charge point. On level for hotel itself, good size with grab rail and pull cord."
hohensalzburg fortress salzburg,negative,Disabled loo is by the ticket office and staff will provide eurokey for access. No loo up at the fort.
holiday inn basildon basildon,positive,Parking is good and easy although only 5 disabled spaces. Parking is close to the entrance on a tarmac surface. 
holiday inn birmingham   bromsgrove bromsgrove,positive,"The hotel is near enough to the M5 to be used as a break or overnight stop, and easy to get to, well signed near to the approach, the delightful appearance warns you you are there. Pull into the right hand turn inside the grounds to reach 3 disabled bays, by the main entrance into hotel."
holiday inn calais   coquelles coquelles,positive,"Very easy to find the hotel if driving.  Perfect if going to or coming from the Tunnel. Plenty of parking, including dedicated disabled parks, all in open air, so no height restrictions.  Step-free from car park to reception. Did not use the public accessible toilet, but the toilet in the bedroom had a grab rail on the right hand side, and plenty of space.  "
holiday inn city centre theatreland glasgow,negative,"Rails just way out of position to the actual loo, and toilet so very low. "
holiday inn express aberdeen city centre aberdeen,negative,"Wet room is roomy enough and has grab rails. BUT-there’s a big bump up from the bedroom, on my shower chair I eventually had to go in backwards.  The tap in the basin is ridiculous. You can have a cold trickle or a hot Niagara-esque deluge. Impossible to wash your hands in warm water without soaking the room and yourself!"
holiday inn express aberdeen city centre aberdeen,positive,There are two disabled parking spaces which are chained off so they can’t be misused. Just ring on arrival and staff will remove the chain. 
holiday inn express braintree,positive,there are 4 accessible parking spaces close to the entrance as above the accessible loo in our room came with a bath with overhead shower their was plenty of grab rails and enough space for a carer it also had an alarm cord in the loo
holiday inn express castle donington,positive,"Good size Car park  Plenty of space for wheelchair and carer.Spotlessly clean and tidy. No changing place toilet  Drive in and register your vehicle at the reception.  We only used the toilet in the room which was very spacious for my wheelchair. Easy to find, sat NAV sorted it out for us, five disabled bays, and lots of spaces. "
holiday inn express doncaster,positive,there are 5 disabled parking bays at the entrance of the hotel and parking is free. accessible toilets were well labelled with ample space and very clean.
holiday inn express droitwich m5 droitwich spa,positive,Easy parking with plenty of disabled bays Only used room toilet which was fine
holiday inn express dundee,positive,"The Holiday Express Inn Dundee is well situated on Dock Street with the bonus  of a council run multi storey car park  in the adjacent Gellatly Street which has a bridge walkway taking one straight into the reception area.  Blue Badge holders are exempt from the reasonable charges. The wetroom was well laid out with a raised toilet with supporting handrails.  It was nice to have a separated hand basin beside the toilet to avoid having to go over to the main basin.  Of which, there was lots of room around the main basin as well as a glass shelf to put things on.   As I require a seat to use whilst at the hand basin, we requested one from the reception, which was supplied straight away. The shower had a pull down seat and supporting handrails.  Easy to use controls made showering easy, although my wife thought I was daft when I described the water flow as being ‘lumpy’  by this, I meant that the water flow was somewhat variable and seemed to come out in lumps at times."
holiday inn express edinburgh,positive,"The other plus of this hotel is the free parking facility for guests.  There are bus stops right outside the hotel and one can be in the center of Edinburgh within 25 minutes, or just a short walk to the Ocean Terminal complex or restaurants.  We also thought the cost of £192.78 for three nights stay to be good value Did not use hotel one nut if it is as good as room – super. The bathroom was spacious and, like the bedroom, had been recently refurbished. We noticed that the fold down seat for the shower had not been put on as yet, but a quick trip to reception remedied this when we were supplied with a portable shower chair.   I found this chair a bit low whilst using the washbasin, but that is a fairly minor issue."
holiday inn express greenock,positive,"Parking 100%....fairly close to the rail station and main road for public transport but we went by car.  Ferries are readily available to Dunoon and Rothesay. easy  to find, plenty of space to manoeuvre, grab rails,  clean and tidy"
holiday inn express london,negative,There are two disabled bays. I have always been able to park in one of those bays when staying. There is plenty of room either side of the car. There is one disabled friendly toilet in the public area. Plenty of space in it to accommodate a manual and power chair.
holiday inn express london   epsom downs surrey,negative,"A lift to take us up for toilets, which we felt were rather small, but very clean and well maintained, with grab handle, but we left wheelchair outside of toilet. "
holiday inn express london   epsom downs surrey,positive,"A big enough car park, with about 6 disabled bays, and very handy for the race course and views of the downs."
holiday inn express manchester,positive,The parking was very very good we could  park outside the hotel and take my stuff out the car The room was big
holiday inn express shrewsbury,positive,"Two or three designated blue badge bays, as well as a large car park."
holiday inn express stafford,positive,"There are a number of disabled blue badge parks directly outside the main entrance, but most are ordinary width, so difficult to get in and out of car.  However, the car park is massive, and we were always able to park close to the entrance straddling two normal bays, so able to get easily into the wheelchair from the car. Toilet in room had sufficient grab rails.  Was a little lower than I am used to, but I was able to use it without problems. There was a disabled toilet in the public area, but I did not use it."
holiday inn express stirling,positive,Plenty of disabled spaces and can drop off at door too x Big toliets with grab rails wet rooms in disabled rooms with seat
holiday inn express taunton,negative,"As usual, disabled loos were not big enough for a wheelchair, a disabled person, and their PA but they were there and very clean"
holiday inn express taunton,positive,There was ample disabled parking front and back. You had to register your registration number so your car didn't get clamped but the staff at more than happy to help with this.
holiday inn harrogate,negative,There are spaces but not enough cannot prebook
holiday inn kenilworth   warwick kenilworth,positive,"Free, secure parking (barrier on exit  at night.  The disabled parks (2) are on a slight slope, and about 40 metres away from the lobby.  It was ok for me in a wheelchair when pushed by my husband, but may be a little far for rollators. Accessible public toilet on ground floor, through one set of doors from the hotel lobby, that were generally left open.  The accessible toilet was right outside the accessible room, and may also be that used by Starbucks' clients during the day."
holiday inn london,negative,In the accessible room we were given altho it was nice and specious - toilet seat itself was Installed to high unfortunately disabling the use of a commode chair Seems so odd to have a room with a ceiling track hoist that has a bathroom with a bath in it!  The bathroom is very large so would make for a great wetroom.
holiday inn london,positive,Specially Allocated spaces right outside the main entrance to the hotel. Dedicated parking at the front entrance of the hotel in the courtyard. Staff very helpful.
holiday inn london   stratford city london,positive,"This hotel is close to the accessible underground station Stratford and accessible railway station Stratford International. There is paid parking of the shopping mall for hotel use, which I have not used. I found it as well easy to get from and to the underground as from and to the railway station."
holiday inn london bloomsbury london,negative,Spacious but has a bath.
holiday inn london bloomsbury london,positive,"Close to Russell Square, a10-15 minute walk from Kings across Station "
holiday inn manchester   city centre manchester,negative,"Got the train, was very close."
holiday inn norwich,positive,"Is situated on one side of Norwich FC's ground at Carrow Road. There are two car-parks and the one I chose had seven disability parking spaces.  It is in the centre of norwich and there are bus stops and a train station nearby.  An accessible toilet by the reception and a large wetroom (with grab rails by the toilet, shower and sinks) in the private room."
holiday inn preston preston,positive,"We parked our WAV in one of the disabled bays right at the door. Parking is free. The bathroom was large, the sink was at a good height, there was space for a turning circle and handles for transferring. There was a bath with shower and a bath board which is great if you want to sit and have a shower if getting in and out of the bath would be difficult. The bathroom was very clean too- always good!"
holiday village seaview sant josep de sa talaia,negative,Transfer was via coach from the airport so this may be a problem. However several chair users arrived via wheelchair taxi from the airport which was only a 30min journey (approx. 20 euro)
holiday village seaview sant josep de sa talaia,positive,"There were several toilets available throughout the site, all were clean and well maintained."
holker hall gardens grange over sands,positive,There are plenty of disabled parking spaces  The toilet was roomy and well equipped with grab rails 
holkham beach wells next the sea,positive,3 dedicated blue badge parking spaces. It's a national trust car park so you do have to pay £2.50 per day. We drove and would imagine it's difficult to access by public transport as its in a rural area. I drove to the beach car park on Beach Road. It’s a Pay and Display Car park although you can pay by card ( instructions on the Pay and Display machine). The car park is large and mainly hard standing. There are a very limited number of Blue Badge spaces but if you don’t need one of those there was ample room to park early on in the day.
holkham hall wells next the sea,positive,Blue Badge holders are able to park right at the entrance to the house. Again as with other attractions in the area driving is definitely encouraged as public transport might be tricky. Accessible loo is located outside a short distance away from the Hall.
holland barrett ilkeston,positive,There are two pay and display car parks to the town centre. Albion centre car park is closest with free parking for badge holders in designated bays. I find these bays are often full. The second car park (Pimlico Street) is usually emptier but further to walk.   If you need to access mobility equipment shopmobility is located  close to Erewash Museum and there is a car park for members. It is only open Thursday and Saturday (9am to 2:30pm). There is a form to complete to become a member.  Bus stops are either up or down a hill. 
holland barrett nottingham,positive,"Parking is free in designated bays with a disabled parking badge.  The bus stops were outside ASDA and Wilko.   Shop mobility (you need to be a member) is located on New Street. Open Tuesday, Wednesday & Friday 9am to 2:30pm. "
holland park london,negative,"The nearest tube station is High Street Kensington, which is not at all step-free. Earl's Court tube station is about ¾ of a mile away and fully step-free. Kensington Olympia station, served by London Overground, is step-free and roughly the same distance away. Zillions of bus routes pass along Kensington High Street, very close to the entrance to Holland Park. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area.  There is an accessible toilet. It's OK, and doesn't require a RADAR key. Expect to be hassled by rude and impatient grandmothers with babies, as the toilet is in constant use for its baby-changing facilities, they will keep trying to open the door while you are doing your business. One really terrible thing about this toilet is that the red emergency cord has been completely ripped out of its mounting and is therefore useless. It means that anyone who falls over and needs to summon help will be unable to do so. This is dangerous and thoughtless and the people responsible for managing this toilet should fix the red emergency cord immediately. "
holland tringham london,negative,"Streatham Hill Station is fully step-free but nearly a mile away, Streatham Station is (disgracefully) totally not step-free. Zillions of bus routes serve Streatham High Road. I don't know about parking in the area.  There is an accessible toilet in the front area, you'll need a RADAR key to gain access, or staff will lend you one, the toilet has enough space and the layout is OK, but I found three annoying problems, see my pictures below.  (1) The red emergency cord was tucked behind a bin. This will not do! It should be easily reachable, so that it can be pulled by anyone who might fall over in the precarious wheelchair-toilet transfers. Hiding the cord behind a bin is exposing people to danger if they cannot summon prompt assistance after a fall. Very silly and thoughtless.  (2) There was a bin in the wheelchair-transfer area. Again, very silly and thoughtless. This area must be kept clear so that wheelchair users can park to transfer to the toilet.   (3) It is not possible to lock the RADAR lock from the inside, it is broken.   "
hollands kaasmuseum alkmaar,positive,"There’s a very well-equipped accessible loo on level one of the museum. Grab rails round the loo, an approachable washbasin and everything within easy reach. Thre’s even some interesting tiling on the walls. A wheelchair accessible toilet is located inside the museum."
hollywood bowl bradford,positive,Their is a disabled toilet accessible for use with good spacing. The main female bathrooms are also spacious enough to move around without difficulty.
hollywood bowl crawley,positive,Blue badge parking is available. Disable toilets available. You have to be able to transfer to the toilets as there are no hoists or changing tables.
hollywood bowl glasgow,negative,"There was an accessible toilet, which had a radar key - excellent. The toilet was very clean, but it was way too small. I need assistance from someone to lift me out of my wheelchair, to the toilet and back in my wheelchair. The small space made transferring very difficult as there was barely any room between my wheelchair and the toilet so there wasn't enough room for my carers legs and mind to stand up. A larger accessible toilet would make things so much easier or better still a changing places toilet. The toilet roll holder was positioned out of reach of the toilet, so people will struggle to reach it if they are on their own. The emergency pull cord was also out of reach and too short so it was not able to hang all the way to the floor like it should. Also because the toilet was too small the only place where I could position my wheelchair was directly next to the hand dryer so it was constantly setting the hand dryer off, which was annoying and too loud."
hollywood bowl glasgow,positive,There is a large carpark as Hollywood Bowl is located at Glasgow Springfield Quay so there are also restaurants. We managed to park directly outside the entrance.
holmfirth library and tourist information centre holmfirth,negative,"I did not visit the toilet, but it is listed as ""partially accessible"" online. There is also a loop system entered. "
holmfirth library and tourist information centre holmfirth,positive,"There is a very small car park adjacent to, and opposite the building. Alternatively there is a larger car park at the co op, a short walk away. There is also the bus station in the center of the town, which runs fairly frequent buses to nearby Huddersfield and Wakefield.  Parking next to Library and opposite, also a few hundred metres away at Co-op.  No trains,  Buses from Huddersfield to Holmfirth Bus station."
holyrood 9a edinburgh,negative,"No dedicated disabled parking but we have parked with a blue badge on the road. The lane on the right hand side of the bar is also good for dropping off, and occasionally has a parking space."
holyrood distillery edinburgh,positive,Easily accessible from Edinburgh city centre  The toilets were modern well laid out and bright and cheerful. The one I visited was spacious and had enough room for my powerchair and a couple of other people. The doors were wide and painted / treated with bright yellow finishes which made them easy to see. No feeling of sitting in a white box with this room.
holyrood park edinburgh,negative,Accessible toilets are provided by the Education Centre. Whilst they are well equipped they drop a couple of stars for the interior colours. They are tiled in a black (or very dark) colour that reduces the amount of light and is not helpful for visually impaired visitors. It is possible to take a vehicle to the toilets and park alongside if required.
holyrood park edinburgh,positive,"Disabled parking spaces are available in the main car park adjacent to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Parking is also available by Dunsapie Loch, St. Maragert's Loch and Duddingston Loch."
home bargains coatbridge,positive,There are 6 spaces available and very clearly marked  these were empty during or visit there are mother and child spaces next to them. The local bus services between Coatbridge and Airdrie all stop near the store however it is a busy road to get across at peek times
home bargains wishaw,positive,There are blue badge parking spaces available in front of store doors. There is also other parking across the three shops. Buses stop at the beginning of the road on the way to and from the hospital. The road/path from the main road to the stores is quite a steep decline and the car park gets busy so I would suggest taking extra caution if coming this way.
home from home penrhyn bay,positive,"Directly outside are 2 parking spots Across the road there are 10 20 yards and there are 6 spaces 2 disabled Both toilets , ladies and gents are on the level"
home lincoln,negative,There are a couple of on-street disabled parking spaces around the corner but they are usually occupied. So I usually park on a different Street nearby and walk. Home is just off the high Street so it's a good central position.
home lincoln,positive,There are 2 disabled toilets. One on the 3rd floor and one on the 5th floor. The one on the 3rd floor you have to go through a door first which makes it a bit trickier to get to. So go to the one on the 5th floor which you don't have to go through any doors to get to.
home manchester,negative,"There is a Q park nearby. It’s not especially close but it’s the best you’re going to get in a poorly served area. You can get 25% off the cost of your ticket if you get your ticket endorsed at the venue.   Plenty supply of buses to Oxford Road but the 2 stops you’re most likely to use coming in or out are notorious from an accessibility perspective. The stop outside Principal hotel (the Refuge Assurance building is narrow; dominated by inconsiderate, perhaps impatient commuters; and so long that it can accommodate multiple buses. This of course makes it near impossible to see your bus coming on many occasions let alone get to. Factor in also the need to cross a bike lane where the crossing points are poorly located; the cyclists simply don’t slow despite speed bumps and clear signage and the idea that the bikes go in one direction only was long ago abandoned.   The stop on the opposite side outside the Dancehouse theatre has all the above problems and more. The pavements on this side are in poor repair all the way to Home. 10 to15 minutes of that may be more than many people will be able to manage.   Please be aware that Google Maps does not have accurate location information for this venue. You will likely still find it but it will point you to a point nowhere near the actual entrance.   If you’re coming to/from Oxford Road railway station then expect an unpleasant slope down to Oxford Road putting aside the many access issues the station itself has. Assuming you can finally make it to Tony Wilson Place then access is on the level but as with anything involving Manchester City Council there are a predictable set of issues. More on this elsewhere."
homelands trust fife lundin links,negative,"Adequate We drove and there are parking spaces just in front of our cottage.   The only reason I've given 3 stars is because its a bit tricky for disabled people to get to via public transport.  I'm not sure if there is local community transport which has accessible vehicles, but I'm sure the Paxton Centre would know about that."
homelands trust fife lundin links,positive,"Disabled parking outside every lodge, although ours (Cardy) didn't have an allocated blue badge space in front of the lodge as the others did.  Two accessible toilets on the ground floor, although the toilet in the wet room was the only one where there was sufficient space to fit a shower commode over the top. Parked a few steps from front door . Every lodge has its own space . All the places we visited had good disability parking. My husband is still able to go to a loo himself so found it relatively easy to find a loo. Disabled parking was available outside the front door of the lodge. Both the loos downstairs were wheelchair accessible. Dedicated space right in front of the lodge with others close by. Left transfer toilet in wet room. Right transfer in adjacent second toilet. .Drop down and fixed grab rails either side. Toilet raiser available if needed. Parking at door,good flat surface and room for visitor parking. All the equipment you could need supplied and thoughtfully laid out shower room and toilets There was disabled parking adjacent to the accommodation. I travelled by car from Dundee to Fife and was able to park my car right infront of our accommodation in a disabled blue badge space. Between everyone that was staying at Homelands with me for the weekend there were four cars, including my own. Not all parking spaces were taken when we arrived so we were able to find spaces for all cars, and I also noticed that the house next to us only had one car between everyone staying there so we were able to use cars further down the driveway. However, I feel if all houses had more than one or two cars between visitor then there might be some difficulties.  Due to not being from this area I am unsure about public transport, although there is information available on the Homeland website. There’s a bus stop 200mm from the entrance to the accommodation, list of certain buses are on the website. Markinch railway station is 8 miles away from Homelands and there are taxi services nearby, I think contact details were available in a book located in the livingroom of the house we stayed in. There was a wet room on the ground level with a toilet and there was a separate toilet on this level too. The wet room was very spacious for me to drive around it in my wheelchair. I had to wash my hair in my wheelchair because the it was so warm (don’t worry covered electronics and was totally safe) and there was plenty of room for me and my helper.   A showerchair was provided for me but, it was a little too big for me to sit in and there was a fold down showerchair attached to the wall. There was a a self cleaning function on the toilet in the wet room but, I didn’t use them. The toilet is positioned in the centre of the wall in the wet room. There is a tracking hoist within the wet room which is separate from the tracking hoist in the bedroom so, you would need to transfer into a chair in the bedroom to then transfer again.  The toilet on the ground level is just the standard size of an accessible toilet. The toilet is closer to the left hand side of the room so, it would be easier for people to transfer at the right hand side.  I do not need the use of an emergency red cord myself because I always need assistance from someone however, I do know about the need for them. The only issue I would say about the toilets at Homelands is that there were no red cords. I don’t know if it’s to make them look more homely and I don’t 100% know if it’s needed but, I’m assuming they are.  On the upper level of the house there was a bathroom. However, a wheelchair user can’t get up to it if they can’t climb stairs which I can’t so, I cannot comment on it. Plenty of parking 2 toilets on ground floor of the bungalow we stayed in ,one had grap rails etc, other one in a  larger shower room also had rails ,was aclosemat toilet , plenty of room for wheelchair access  . Shower chairs or shower trolley available We drove there and there is parking directly at the door of the lodge, in addition there is parking for any visitors you may have as well. There is a bus stop on the main road that is just around the corner from Homelands. Vast space with stacks of room for carers to assist - facilities spotless!  Disabled parking everywhere Excellent There are plenty of disabled parking spaces just in front of the paxton centre. Toilets very acccessible   Only down side is that the sink being slightly too close to toilets can make transferring tricky. There was a large accessible loo that is separate to the wet room. Homelands offers parking adjacent to the Lodges near to the front doors. Nearest bus stop on main road about quarter mile. Two of the lodges have closomat toilets.  There is plenty of space around the toilets, some for left hand transfer, some for right hand transfer.   There are grab rails and plenty of space (we had two wheelchairs and a carer in the bathroom at any given time). There are additional bathrooms/cloakrooms for guests/other party members and these too are all accessible.  Everywhere was clean and hygienic. The sinks were too small and this will be addressed in the new lodges in phase two. Lots of parking and a space right outside the door. Fully adapted wetroom and toilet, plus a separate toilet with grab rails, handles etc. Loads of room and very well thought out. Plenty, roomy parking spaces outside the lodges. Large and spacious. Parking was right outside the lodge Several dedicated disabled parking spaces. Good public transport links to the village. Two spacious accessible toilets, one right transfer and one left . One downstairs and one upstairs with lift to first floor. Parking for blue badge holders at the door of the lodges - plenty of other parking nearby on the grounds Excellent plus wet room Lots of disabled spaces ample for every house and more.  Didn't use public transport. Huge wetroom on the ground floor as well as a further suitably equipped toilet  We drove.  There was parking close to the house. no changing place toilet that i saw but spacious toilets with grab rail and one was a closomat toilet.  There was a seat raise but it did not fit on the closomat toilet. There was a second downstairs toilet but it had a sink very close to it so i dont know if the raise seat would have fit on there, my dad would not have been able to get up from that toilet.  Designated space at each cottage and otgers very close by.   Bus links to Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews, Dundee from the village. Accessible rail station eight mikes away. Edinburgh Airport 45 minutes by car. Large wet floor shower room/ toilet with ceiling tracking hoist, drop down shower seat, wheeled shower chair, shower trolley on request, Clos-o-Mat toilet i(n 2 lodges) Parking at the lodge  Excellent facilities. Spacious roll in shower and plenty room to move  There are two toilets on the ground floor; one toilet/sink only and one in the wet room. The wet room has an excellent ceiling hoist. We hired a supportive shower chair. The toilet is a Closomat wash & dry and was easily operated by the user. For other users it also had simple flush operated by either elbow (no twisting required!).  The wet room is huge and we had no issues moving about or transferring. Plenty of space for parking the Motability van  and also visitors cars.  Large accessible bathroom with all facilities needed to assist with washing, etc. Closomat toilet which is ideal for those who can go independently.   Great parking Great Disabled parking for one car at the door lots of disabled parking next to that, all facilities required in the lodges Disabled parking for 1car right outside lodge, but further parking available immediately opposite  Excellent parking facilities for Disabled and visitors' vehicles on designated hard standings.  A short walk takes you to the main road and bus stop where frequent and regular local buses connect Lundin Links to the East Neuk of Fife villages and also Leven, Kirkcaldy, Glenrothes and Dunfermline in North and West Fife.  Taxis to Leven are also readily available at a very reasonable cost. There are two ground floor toilets in each lodge.  One is suitable for walking disabled people and has grab rails. The other is in the very spacious wet room and also has grab rails.  This is ideal for wheelchair users and attendants. dedicated parking right outside the front door, all level no kerbs etc Wet rooms, tracking hoist & clos-o-mat, shower trolley There is plenty of parking close to your lodge. The only criticism is that the surface this visit was a little difficult to manoeuvre a wheelchair on. Good, in a well thought out wet room Fantastic car park.  You can get a space right outside your cottage. Sensitively designed.  Well done. we had our own car and were able to park feet from the entry to our cottage. not 100% sure about rating for a hoist user but I used a standing aid and wheelchairs and it was great - very roomy! Parking at the accommodation. Parking right outside for one vehicle. Flat block paving. More parking just a few yards away. 2 accessible loos. Space to right side of one and left of the other. Spacious. Parking available. We arrived by car but feel it would not be easy if using public transport Free disabled parking at Argyll Street in St Andrews. Ample parking at Crusoe Hotel and Upper Largo Hotel. Old Manor Hotel is 5 minute walking distance from Homelands. We didn't use public transport, but I understand Stagecoach offer wheelchair accessible transport from most bus stops. There was a bus stop which was accessed via the shortcut through the bin store to the main road. There is a large wet room with a Closomat toilet. The shower chair did not fit over this, but the hoist system allows access. There is also another toiled adjacent to the wet room with handrails. My son needs a tilt in space shower chair so we brought our own as we knew we would need it. There is a Freeway shower chair in situ and there is a list of equipment available at no extra charge on Homelands website.  Lots of parking spaces right outside, one for each lodge right at the door, and further spaces opposite.   Not sure how easy public transport would be, but having a car (or several cars) is ideal.  2 access loos! One a really spacious wet room with a hoist that goes everywhere, the other a roomy w/c and sink.  Another loo upstairs, so no problem for frequent visits to toilet, plenty for everyone! We drove and there was ample parking, including disabled spaces, just next to the accommodation  Big accessible toilet and shower room Car space right in front of lodge Plenty of room in bathroom and ceiling hoist there too. We drove and there is ample parking ,even for guests.  Upstairs has an en-suite double room for carers or friends and downstairs has supersized wetroom / bathroom and additional toilet.  All well planned. Excellent parking at the lodge door (Cardy lodge ‘s parking is just opposite the front door a few metres away). Other accessible parking spaces in the car park.  Nearest bus stops are about 200-250 metres away, close to the shops. Buses pass through the village to St Andrews (link bus to Dundeé), Leven,. Edinburgh and Glasgow can be reached with 1 change. NB It may be necessary to have your w/chair checked by Stagecoach for size/ manoeuvrability.   Markinch rail station is only 15 minutes away.  All 4 lodges have huge wet-room.  2/4 lodges have Clos-o-May toilets.  All ground floor toilets are accessible- with one facilitating a left side transfer and the other a right side transfer. Grab rails around both the toilet and shower areas.  Ample space for carers to assist. Selection of S hower chairs and trolleys available for showering.  Plenty of disabled parking.  Homelands have contact details for wheelchair adapted taxis.  Public transport might be a bit more difficult. Used my own van for transport, but plenty of bus stops near property. Ample disabled parking adjacent to property.  Accessible toilet in wet room and plenty of space for carers to manoevre. Only problem I had was that my own high backed shower chair didn't fit over the toilet. parking at the door very accessible every thing you need The access road is quite steep because of the location but once on the level there is an abundance of parking spaces on level ground adjoining the units. We ate out most evenings and would recommend the food (especially the seafood) at The Ship Inn, Elie; the 19th Hole, Earlsferry; The Crusoe Hotel, Lower Largo; The Upper Largo Hotel; and the Old Manor, Lundin Links. We did not need to use a disabled toilet at any of these hotels, so please check beforehand if one is required.  The Fishing Museum in Anstruther is well worth a visit and 90% wheelchair accessible and the café food good. The toilets in Homelands are excellent but I would not like to comment on disabled toilets generally as we did not require them. Parking at the door of the lodge. Wet room easy to use and toilet accessible. Right outside the door Homelands is easy to find and there is ample space to park at the rear of the complex. All toilets are maintained to the highest level. Wide doors are standard as are grab rails and reachable basins. There is plenty of accessible parking available both in the car park and outside the individual lodges. There are accessible toilets in the Paxton centre and the individual lodges. Each toilet is very spacious. Dedicated space at front door, others nearby. Spacious wet room with shower and left transfer loo.  Second accessible toilet with right transfer loo. One disabled parking space immediately outside each cottage and several others in car park very close by. 'H'-frame ceiling tracker hoists in the accessible toilet allowing transfer at any point in the room. Clos-o-Mat toilets in 2 of the cottages Second smaller (but within regulation) 'accessible' toilet in each cottage downstairs. Disabled parking is excellent, with each cottage having it's own allocated parking space.  The village is on a main bus route, with direct bus links to St Andrews and Edinburgh as well as local bus services.  2 train stations within approximately 10 miles, Markinch and Kirkcaldy. Spacious wet floor accessible toilet with modern fittings. There was excellent parking onsite, right outside the front door of the lodge. There was additional parking bays reserved for blue badge holders. As a manual wheelchair user in an energy efficient chair, I found the parking surface for the additional parking a bit tricky under my front wheels but it was manageable with a wee bit extra care. We travelled round about and had no problems parking in any of the nearby villages or in St Andrews, Elie, Pittenweem etc. Full accessible, very large in size and had a variety of handles, grab rails etc. Overall it was brilliant."
homeleigh country cottages red roses,positive,"Easy access and good parking facilities Up to date accessible, well planned and designed toilet and bathing facilities and a first class new laundry and drying room."
honey pot creative cafe south queensferry,positive,"There is a train station (Dalmeny) which is approx. a 10 minute walk away - it is down hill to the Creative Café, but might not be such an easy walk/push going back up it!  We travelled by car. There is a small parking area just outside the Creative Café (unmarked gravel area), but there is a larger car-park just before you reach the Café, which has several marked disabled bays.   There are some narrow and cobbled roads as you come through South Queensferry, so it is a little more bumpy for a few minutes. It is a popular place with tourists, so the streets can be fairly busy, but everyone seemed quite accommodating of each other. "
hong chinese restaurant pumpherston,negative,They have a small car park but you can park on the side of the road with ease. Seemed to be easy access but never actualy had to use them.
hong kong international airport chek lap kok,positive,"My husband claims they are the best he has been in. Open and spacious, with push buttons to open and lock."
hope and anchor inn bolton,positive,On site car park. Bus stop outside. Disabled toilet with grab rails and emergency chord.
hope cross cottage at vicarage farm buxton,positive,"The parking was directly in front of the cottage, all on one level so perfect.  The wet room was perfect, spacious, wide doorways for access. Sufficient grap rails and even provided a shower chair so couldn't have asked for more. Parking space for the cottage is right outside the door, the car park is level tarmac and is shared with other guests.  The road to the cottage is used by farm traffic but there are passing places available. The accessible shower/wet room is excellent.  The shower chair/commode is a self-propelled aquatec ocean XL.  There is an accessible toilet and wash basin and grab rails if required. Could not be better, outside the front door and on smooth tarmac. Possibly the best we have experienced. Parking right outside cottage door. Parking right outside cottage  Basin could do with being closer to toilet, but possible good grab rails We drove there. It’s rather rural so a car is best I think. The parking was great and right outside the cottage (level access). There’s room for several vehicles and we had no problem getting our Alhambra in or using the hoist to get my chair in and out.  The wet room is amazing. Raised toilet, hand rails wherever you may need them, a sink I can actually use from the chair and not get wet! The shower is lovely and although I didn’t need to use it, the shower chair was a really helpful addition. It’s only 4 stars purely because I couldn’t use the en-suite. Not fair really since the wet room was so good, but I don’t want to give unreal expectations if someone wants to use all areas of the cottage.  Perfect parking, just outside the door of the cottage, so easy to load/unload.  Really a five star bathroom/wet room, so spacious and clean. Included everything from shower chair, grab rails, lowered sink etc.  Easy, flat access throughout. You can park right outside the door which makes things so easy.  The accessilble wetroom is perfect, it is designed very nicely, like you are in a hotel. The toilet has grab rails at either side, the sink is a great level for when you are in a wheelchair, non slip floor and there is a wheelchair shower chair to use too. Very spacious, which is just what we need!  Parking outside Hope Cross Cottage is accessible.  As our stay was short we did not investigate other means of transport The wet-room at Hope Cross Cottage is superb. Room to manoeuvre and transfer and more than adequate grab rails around the loo and shower area. There is also a self-propelling shower chair. The cottage is detached and has both a car park and space for several cars directly in front of the premises - all on one level. Plenty of space, and elegant. Everything works perfectly. The owners designed everything with an Occupational Therapist and physio. And it really shows! We arrived by car. We found the cottage easily using google maps and there was parking right outside the front door for 2-3 vehicles. There is a large wetroom with a toilet, sink and shower. My son doesn't use the toilet so we didn't test it out with a disabled person. Easy parking right outside the front door and level access to the front door. Excellent disabled toilet and wet room. higher level toilet, grab rails and non-slip flooring. Immediately outside, with level entrance to cottage Parking was right outside the door which we were super thankful for. Big easy entry.  Really really well kept and extremely clean. Plenty of space for aids and several people at once. Both hand held and stationary shower making showers very pleasant for Nan.  With handrails and shower chair / Camode. With separate ensuite for us.  Parking is all level and immediately outside the cottage.  Very easy to get in and out. Great amount if room. Room for carer if needed. Parking is adjacent to the cottage. Perfect No public transport facilities that we are aware of. Small village. Plenty of parking space for our huge wheelchair adapted van. Because of the very cold winds, we parked right by the front door, but there is space to the side of the building too. Not enough room for 2 carers to help onto toilet but in our case our son could use the grab handles to help stand up. Car parking at the front of the property giving level access to the front door. Raised seat height with grab rails. Car a necessity. Parking in the property's own drive. Perfectly designed, huge space Easy parking for our large wheelchair accessible vehicle right beside the front door on smooth Tarmac  Plenty of space in wet room for wheelchair or showerchair and carer"
hope park keswick,negative,I have only used the disabled toilet in the theatre which is adequate.
hope park keswick,positive,"A large car park which is well maintained. Disabled spaces are on the slope adjacent to the Theatre on the Lake, but it is easy to find and end car parking space."
horniman museum and gardens london,positive,"The following bus routes are useful:  176, 185, 197, 356, P4 - stop outside the Museum and Gardens on London Road 122 - stops on Dartmouth Road P13 - stops on Underhill Road 363 - stops on Sydenham Hill Road  The museum is a five to ten minute walk from Forest Hill station and is signposted from the platform 1 exit. TfL claims that Forest Hill station is step-free from street to platform (I haven't checked whether this is really true). You'll need to talk to staff if you need a ramp to board/leave the trains. Forest Hill station is on the London Overground network which offers a turn-up-and-go service, so there's no need to book assistance in advance.  Parking in the area is very difficult.  I used the accessible toilet in the basement floor. It's spacious and well-designed, half a star lost because the emergency cord had been tucked away out of reach of anyone who might fall to the floor and need to call assistance - this is silly and thoughtless. See my photo below.   As per website, we drove to the back and the gate was opened to drive in and park by the building. 3-4 accessible bays on a slight incline, hard smooth surface. A few speed ramps in the park. See photo. Not 100 % standard but spacious. Right support rail is a little further away than standard and the seat is permanently raised. Soap is a pump dispenser. Baby changing in all toilets but not marked on the door so parents were taking up the accessible toilet. Emergency cord does not reach the floor and does not have handles. Good floor grip, slightly wet. No hoist or changing bench."
horse groom guildford,negative,"They have a really small car park. Whilst they have 3 disabled bays, I couldn’t use one as a sports car with no blue badge was parked in the space, so I had to park across the road.  Couldn’t get most wheelchairs into the accessible loo. It was up two steps from where we were. Really badly laid out too. "
horse guards parade london,negative,There are no accessible toilets on site. An accessible toilet is situated in nearby St. James Park.
horsforth library horsforth,positive,"Small car park with disabled parking There was an accessible toilet with an alarm cord, the toilet was very spacious. Once again I did not use a wheelchair, so I am unable to comment if there would be enough space for a wheelchair user to be accompanied with another person."
hortus the hague,positive,Can't comment on the parking. The restaurant is about 15 minutes wheel/walk from the city centre. Use 24 or Bus 28 from the city centre gets you to about 5 minutes wheel/walk from Hortus and the closest stop is called Alexanderplein. Our hotel (Hilton Den Haag) was a similar distance from the restaurant.
hoswick visitors centre hoswick,positive,There is an accessible parking bay immediately in front of the building. It was a little worrying getting in and out though as it is on the road passing the centre and doesn't have any hatch markings so passing cars come pretty close to you. There is another small car park at the bottom of the building which has space for three more cars.
hot water comedy club at holiday inn liverpool,negative,Didn't use parking facilities so can't comment. Didn't use toilet facilities so couldn't comment.
hotel albert 1er nice,positive,"I recevied excellent special assistance at Nice Airport, with the lady wheeled me out to my bust stop and then checked with the bus driver that the bus was going to where I needed to go.   I took the 98 bus from the airport bus stop into Nice. The bus is accessible. The fare is 6 euros (2018) and you can pay the bus driver. I took the bus to Albert 1er stop. Its the first stop once the bus turns off the sea front, and the stop before is Congrès / Promenade. the journey took about 20 minutes. When I got off at Albert 1 er bus stop look in the direction the bus is travelling and on the same side of the road you are on, you will see in front of you an overhanging, blue hotel sign. at the first floor level and this is Albert 1er Hotel, see photo. There is a side street to cross but it took about 1 minute to walk to the hotel.  On the way back to the airport you get the bus from the opposite side of the gardens, on Prom de Anglais, directly outside Casino Ruhl, next to McDonalds which is on the corner, which has Le Meridian hotel on the upper floors. There are accessible toilets in the 3 accessible rooms. On the first floor there is a regular toilet and a seperate shower room, which required a key, but which might have had an accessible toilet inside.  I did not have a accessible toielt in my room but I found it easy to use as I was able to support myself on the vanity sink unit next to the toilet."
hotel alpen rose bolzano,negative,"Being in 'the middle of nowhere' (Bolzano is 40 minutes away), you need to arrive and go anywhere by road.   But there is a car park outside the hotel - not large but perfectly adequate. Very good - and that includes the ensuite ones."
hotel america cannes,positive,"Hotel America is located in Rue Notre Dame, a level one way street, 2 roads back from La Croisette/ sea front. I travelled by public transport on the Cannes Express 210 bus. This departs from Nice Airport every 30 minutes during the day and the bus serves both Terminals 1 and 2 in both directions. The bus itself is a coach. There are 3 - 4 steps up at the entrance and a sign by the front door showing a person with a stick. In the middle door is a wheelchair sign. On the way there the driver was very helpful, saw me with my crutch and straight away asked (in French and then in English) to put my suitcase on the bus. On the way back the driver just opened the boot and I had to bend down to put my case in. The journey cost 33 euros return (2017) and journey time via a motorway took about 40 minutes.  The bus stop in Cannes is by the Hotel de Ville. It is then a 8 - 10 minute level walk with my suitcase to the hotel. On the return journey the bus can be picked up at the end of the road where the hotel is on Rue des Serbes, so just 1 minutes' walk away. However while I was staying there were road works and on my return journey I had to board the bus outside Cannes train station.  Cannes train station is a 5 - 8 minute walk away, the route between the station and hotel involves a slight slope downwards, however as I didn't use the train I'm unable to comment. I chose the bus as the nearest train station to Nice Airport is a local bus or a taxi ride away, the Express 210 seemed to be the easiest option. Please be aware the hotel itself is on a quiet side street but La Croisette which you walk along from the Hotel de Ville is busy. Also please be aware while most pavements have dropped kerbs, there are a couple places when one side of the street has a dropped kerb and the other side doesn't.  Sorry unable to comment about parking or taxis as I didn't use them, but taxis seemed to be plentiful but I believe they are quite expensive, There is a toilet in the reception area by the breakfast room and lounge area. This is spacious and had a single grab rail. "
hotel antico borgo riva del garda,negative,"The hotel is located on a very narrow pedestrianised area of Riva, this street does allow vehicle access for disability reasons, but however there is no parking close to the hotel. If you arrive by coach then you need to make your own way to the hotel which is approx 400m through the uneven streets of Riva del Garda (the staff from the hotel will meet you from the coach though)  I did not witness an accessible loo, but I'd be surprised if there wasn't one considering the amount of work they have put in to make the hotel as accessible as possible. "
hotel beau rivage nice,positive,"There are a couple of step free public transport options from Nice Airport. In December 2019, tram line 2 was extended from Nice Airport to Nice Port Lympia. There platform for the tram is directly outside Terminal 2 and there is also a stop at Terminal 1. The trams are modern, with step free access from the platform. There are wheelchair spaces. This is the quickest way to get into Nice city centre as the trams are very frequent during the day and the journey time is very quick. The tram travels at street level to Centre Universitaire Méditerranéen and then goes underground from Alsace-Lorraine. I exited at Jean Médecin. There was a lift from platform to ticket hall level and then a second lift from ticket hall to street level. From here I could have exited the station and changed trams, at no additional cost and taken Line 1, one stop to Masséna. However, I walked from Jean Médecin and it was about a 8 – 10 minute, level walk with my case to the hotel.   If you decide to take the tram from the Airport please note there are 2 tram lines that depart from the Airport. Tram Line 3 goes in a north direction to Saint – Isidore and most tourists won’t need this line. Tickets for the tram need to be purchased before you board and on the tram there is a machine to validate your ticket. There were machines on the tram platform. A single ticket for the tram or bus is 1.50 euro (December 2019). With a few exceptions such as the Airport bus number 98, the ticket allows you to change buses/trams as much as you like within 74 minutes, you will just need to validate your ticket on each vehicle you board.  However, I brought a 10-trip ticket for 10 euros from the machine and I used it throughout my 5 days stay and still have 1 journey left to use next time I’m in Nice.   The other option is to take the 98 airport bus from the airport bus stop into Nice. The bus is accessible. The fare is 6 euros (December 2019) and you can pay the bus driver. The bus goes along the sea front and you will need to get off at Albert 1er stop. It’s the first stop once the bus turns off the sea front, and the stop before is Congrès / Promenade. The journey takes about 20 minutes. From the Albert 1 er bus stop continue along the street in the direction the bus is travelling and remain on the same side of the road you are on. The first road on your right is Rue Saint François de Paule, turn into the road and the hotel is close by on the right hand side. The hotel takes up an entire block so it quite large and recognisable.  In my room I had an accessible toilet with a single grab rail and in the ground floor communal area there was also an accessible public toilet. It was signposted from reception. There was a manual door into the sink area which had wheelchair space below. Then there was a second manual door into the spacious toilet area. There was a single grab rail, see photos. There was no emergency cord and the door was unlocked/ didn’t require a special key to open it. The toilet was very clean."
hotel bethel copenhagen,negative,There was no accessible toilet in my room. However the toilet was my the edge of the wall and I was able to grab that to pull myself up. I don't know if the hotel has any communal toilets.
hotel bethel copenhagen,positive,"There is very good accessible, step free public transport in Copenhagen. From the airport there is train and metro stations. By metro it is a 15 journey to Kongens Nytorv station. From there it was about a 5 minute walk to the hotel. There are also a number of buses that stop very close by. Buses and metro are regular and both have designated spaces for wheelchair users. "
hotel britannia excelsior lake como griante,negative,"There is a disabled toilet at the end of the lobby that has handrails and is reasonably spacious, with plenty of room for a carer.  However,  turning on the lights and locking the door are not straightforward operations!"
hotel britannia excelsior lake como griante,positive,"I came by Shearings coach, but there is a disabled parking space opposite the hotel entrance and this space does appear to be kept free for disabled use.  It might be best to liaise with the hotel in order to book the space."
hotel chocolat cafe glasgow,positive,"Close to St Enoch Car Park and public transport The red cord was too short, the lugs on the toilet seat had not been properly adjusted and there was a nappy bin in the transfer space HOWEVER, the store has only been open for a week and the manager was very welcoming of and attentive to my feedback. SO I am giving the 4 stars for a good start with a positive attitude. I have told them I will return to check the toilet again and adjust my rating bit could be up or down. "
hotel de hallen amsterdam,negative,"No accessible toilet in public area of Hotel. Bedroom bathroom was big enough to get a self propelled chair into but there are no rails. So you need a degree of mobility. Generally accessible toilets are few and far between. The only one we found was in a shop called V&D on the 4th floor. Some hotels also have disabled toilets Mostly I had to use ordinary toilets take my chair in, get help to take it out and bring it back."
hotel de hallen amsterdam,positive,No disabled parking spaces but parking available on the street. There are trams a short walk from the hotel and throughout the city. Every tram we used had good wheelchair access ie low doorways and wheelchair space
hotel de la fontaine nice,positive,"Th easy way to get from Nice Airport is to take the step free Tram Number 2 going towards the Port and exit at Alsace-Lorraine station. From the Airport this is the first station to be underground, but there is lift access from platform to street level. From the station it's a level, step free 5 - 10 minute walk to the hotel. Exiting the lift I would suggest to continue walking straight ahead, a small park is on your left hand side. When you get to the second road, Le Victor Hugo restaurant is on the corner (as of 2020), turn right into Rue de Rivoli. You will also see a sign for Musee Massena (museum) which is on the same street and same block as the hotel. Rue de France is the third road down and you will see Musee Massena (museum) on the corner. The hotel is on the same side as the museum, so cross the road and turn left. The hotel is on the same block and you can recognise it by its vertical sign saying Hotel. If you travel by tram it will cost 1.50 euros (2020). Alternatively there is the Airport bus which will cost 6 euros, with stops on the Promenade des Anglais. There are several other buses that go along the Prom. Room 4 is an accesible room with accessible toilet with grab rails and is slighly raised."
hotel de rijper eilanden de rijp,positive,"The hotel has accessible parking, along with vehicles that are equipped for wheelchairs and can assist with transport.  The company Accessible Travel Netherlands can also assist with transportation when needed. The toilets are very accessible"
hotel el tope puerto de la cruz,negative,I didnt find any accessible toilets. On the ground floor there are regular toilets.   In my room although there was no toilet grab rail I was able to easily use the vanity unit to help me up. 
hotel el tope puerto de la cruz,positive,"There are 2 airports in Tenerife. The nearest airport is Tenereife North. However, most airlines from the UK fly to Tenerife South. I flew in to there and I found the special assiatance staff very helpful and friendly. There are buses and shuttles that do transfers to Puerto de la Cruz. However I booked a taxi transfer. The journey took about an hour and it cost £138 (2018) for a return journey. I used Holiday Taxis, which offered accessible transport. However thought I had booked a regular taxi, there was no additional information box to mention my disability, and found that although I was the only passenger on the way there I was in a minibus and on my return a full size coach, so if you have access needs please check."
hotel elysees 8 paris,positive,"We took the euro star from London direct to Paris then took a taxi to the hotel, this was only a short 10/15 minute journey"
hotel football stretford,positive,A very good size. My shower chair fitted well in the shower but not over the loo. I appreciate however a higher toilet is preferable for many people.
hotel ibis bristol,positive,"Multi story car park across the road with disabled parking on lower level, lift up to street level. Take parking ticket to reception for reduction of parking charges. Bathroom was a wet room, good size,able to get a hoist in with plenty of room. Only down side was no shower chair, although the toilet was close enough that I could sit on it with lid closed and the shower could reach"
hotel ibis budget manchester,negative,"I am unsure if there was parking available at the hotel as I went via train. Piccadilly station is located near the hotel, with wheelchair taxis available from outside the station. "
hotel ibis budget manchester,positive,"The suite had a wet room, which had a pull down hand rail situated next to the toilet. I am unsure whether all suites contain a wet room, or if it has to be requested when booking. "
hotel ibis budget southampton,positive,Large car park which is shared by two other hotels in the group. Barrier entry due to the shopping center (which charges for parking) next door. Disabled spaces next to entrance. Did not use the general bar toilets. The toilet in my disabled room was excellent though. Slide door so easy to shut and open plus access in a wheelchair. Bars throughout and drop armrest. Fold down seat in the shower. Has emergency cords by toilet and shower. Was able to park right outside hotel  Nice and large 
hotel ibis edinburgh,negative,Difficult to move around for example chair needed in bathroom. Bathroom inside is spacious and easy to use.
hotel ibis edinburgh,positive,"For me, access to public transport was important as a visually impaired person.  Frequent buses pass by the front door to all parts of the city. There are bus stops on both sides of the road and traffic lights make for a safe road crossing. There was an accessible toilet near to the bar area. Well signposted, brightly lit and spacious. The accessible bathroom wet rooms with level access and disabled toilets are again well sized, have grab rails on either side of the toilet and by the sink, and have sinks which are easy to get under in a wheelchair. This is city centre so very convenient for buses. We didn't bring a car so don't know about disabled parking. We had a disabled room and the bathroom has all that we need. The room itself (725) is really too small for a wheelchair but we managed. The hotel is good value, clean and well maintained. We walked from train station so it was quite accessible. Frequent and numerous buses pass along the street outside the main entrance. Edinburgh's Waverley Railway Station is a fifteen-minute walk away.  There is no parking at the hotel as it is located in a busy part of the town. There is some on street parking in nearby Chambers Street. Long stay parking is further away.  Whilst there is a loading bay situated outside the main entrance it is on the street and subject to some restrictions.  Public transport is good with lots of buses passing by the front door going to all parts of the city. All the Lothian buses are wheelchair accessible. An accessible toilet is adjacent to the bar and dining area. It was spacious and clean and tidy."
hotel ibis glasgow city centre glasgow,negative,I was able to get dropped off right outside. Taxis can be called at reception. Nearest buses I’d imagine is two streets over on Sauchiehall Street.
hotel ibis glasgow city centre glasgow,positive,"We arrived by train and that was close by but the pavements in the area are in poor condition and there was not always a dropped kerb. We didn't have a car so I can't comment on parking. In the bedroom, the loo was fully accessible, with a non-slip floor, which is helpful. There is no toilet on the ground floor but there is one on the first floor (lift access) which is convenient. By car: The hotel is a 3-4 minute drive from Glasgow Queen Street station, the nearest train station.  Parking is available outside the hotel.  Taxis can drop off outside the hotel but may not be able to stop by the kerb depending on space availability.  The hotel are able to call for taxis which normally arrive within 5 minutes. Walking: Glasgow Queen Street rail station is an 8 minute walk from the hotel.  I would allow 15-20 minutes to be safe, especially as at the time of writing there is major construction work going on at the station which may cause some delay.  I only used the room toilet so cannot comment on any reception/ restaurant ones. There was plenty turning space if you can get your chair past the beds. Toilet was quite high which I liked for transferring. There are two red cords - one at the toilet and another at the shower. The shower has a small pull down bench. Shampoo/conditioner/body wash is bolted to the wall which might be a pain for some to twist and reach. Oh, the best part is the door to the bathroom is a sliding door which made moving around a lot easier too."
hotel ibis lincoln,positive,Good parking 4 spaces close to doors and flat entry.
hotel ibis london gatwick airport gatwick,positive,"Directly on the main road near to Gatwick airport On-site parking available, dedicated blue badge spaces Accessible shuttle bus available to airport"
hotel ibis montpellier centre comedie montpellier,positive,"I'm not 100% sure if there was parking available at this hotel, however there was plenty ssteet parking for taxis to drop passangers off right outside the entrance of the hotel. There was also a taxi rank/accessible tram stop a short wheel up from the hotel should you require one to venture further into town."
hotel ibis wembley,negative,"Parking was payable even for disabled customers, which I find unacceptable as public transportation links to this hotel are not great for mobility impaired transport users. Fine if you can use sticks but a big step for those who cannot transfer."
hotel ilunion barcelona,negative,"The hotel loo was very good but access to city loos are very disappointing. Space was very restricted and most toilets were too low for my height which is 6' 2"" / 1.87m"
hotel ilunion barcelona,positive,"Did not use the hotel car park.  Transport around Barcelona:- Bus, Metro, Tram, Trains and Coaches were all very good."
hotel indigo edinburgh   princes street edinburgh,negative,"The local bus service is very good, almost all buses stopping or starting at some point along Princess street, a fairly regular service, and disabled area on bus is well respected by other users. Bus stop numbers are clearly signed, with full details of the bus numbers on display."
hotel indigo edinburgh   princes street edinburgh,positive,"We did not have to use public toilets here, so cannot advice you, but bathroom in our room was very good, enough space to manoeuvre, grab rails and pull cord, clean and tidy."
hotel indigo newcastle newcastle upon tyne,positive,"Accessible loo on ground floor but we didn't use it.  We didn't drive. The hotel has parking to the rear of the building. Its central location means that trains, buses and the Tyne and Wear Metro can be accessed easily. There is an accessible toilet adjacent to the restaurant, though we did not use it. The ensuite accessible loo and wet-room shower in our room were excellent - well-equipped with grab rails, a seat in the shower and an alarm, and spacious."
hotel indigo york,negative,Quite simply get unloaded outside the entrance in what is a quiet street. The car park is approx 250 yards away around the back of the properties opposite the hotel. 
hotel indigo york,positive,"Close to the restaurant  and bar area is a well equipped disabled loo which was spotless. In our bedroom we had a wet room which was excellent. However for those who cannot weight bear and rotate to get onto the toilet the4e would be a challenge as a wheelchair cannot get alongside the toilet itself. The shower has a chair and grab handles so it worked well for me. As this venue is in the city centre there is no allocated parking, however, it is located directly opposite multiple bus stops to provide access from various areas of York and further afield (eg. Hull). There are ample dropped curbs to allow safe crossing from these bus stops. The accessible toilet was slightly hidden from the main restaurant area, but visible from the entrance doors and staff were more than willing to take us directly once we asked for directions. There was more than enough space for both the wheelchair user and myself, the sink was accessible to both of us. It was very clean and as a brand new renovation was finished to a high standard. The station was a short walk away (5 mins).  The bathroom in the hotel room was huge!! Lots of space, shower/wet room with seat and grab rails, sink unit was lower down. The bathroom was stunning, its nice to see that accessible did not mean less luxurious!"
hotel le galion saint martin de re,positive,"I took a taxi to/from the hotel booking the taxi company which featured on the hotel's website. It was easy arranged. The vehicle was a people carrier and on the way back they brought a people carrier with a slide out step for easier access. There are buses from La Rochelle. St Martin de Re La Port bus stop is 2 minutes away from the hotel. The buses are coaches and the door by the driver has a sign for people with mobility difficulties, although there was a hand rail, the steps were still quite steep. The middle door of the buses are labelled with a wheelchair sign.  The toilet in my bathroom was raised, I was sitting on tip toe, and there was one grab rail on the right hand side. There was no emergency alarm cord."
hotel market barcelona,positive,"We didn't try to drive on this trip as we were staying in the city centre, so I can't comment on the parking, but the public transport was great. There are wheelchair accessible buses everywhere and most metro stations are accessible too, including Sant Antoni, the nearest one to the hotel. The loo in our bathroom had good rails and was easy for me to use. Nice and clean, as you'd hope for a hotel bathroom."
hotel medemblik medemblik,positive,The main floor of the hotel has an accessible toilet with hand rails.  The hotel room bathrooms  have no adaptations for accessibility.
hotel monsieur cadet paris,negative,I use a walking stick with no issues
hotel monsieur cadet paris,positive,Spotless
hotel olympus palace salou,negative,We didn't see a disabled toilet in the hotel where the other toilets were but I wouldn't be able to use it without a hoist anyway. The toilet in the bedroom couldn't be accessed with a hoist alone because the space wasn't in the room to use it. Going into the shower/toilet room was OK but to get out was an issue unless you backed out as the hard front casters got cough in the laminate floor trim between the tiles in the shower/toilet room and the laminate floor in the bedroom.
hotel rendezvous skipton,positive,We drove and parked at the front of the hotel 
hotel rival stockholm,positive,"The Rival is in Mariatorget, a beautiful garden square. It has excellent public transport links.   From Arlanda Airport, the easiest way is by the commuter train, as this will involve only one train to Sodra Train Station and then a 5 - 8 minute level walk, down one street until you reach the garden square at the end and then the hotel is on the right hand side of the square. There are 2 trains per hour to Sodra and the train journey takes about 40 minutes. This is the route I travelled by.  Please note that the trains to Sodra depart from Arlanda Central Station in Sky City, although you remain indoors, this is a quite a walk from the airport terminus. On the way from the airport I had special assistance, which was excellent, they took me to buy my ticket and then took me onto the platform and advised me of the time of my next train. On the way to the airport I didn't notice the assiatance call buttons at Arlanda Central Station and with my case and crutch it took me a good 10 minutes to walk to my terminal. I would advise if you book special assistance to make yourself known at Arlanda Central Station and wait for your assistance to arrive. The final thing to note about this route is that even if you have a pre-paid travel card you have to pay a supplement of 120 SEK (2019) to travel on this route. It was explained to me that this is because it is a train line owned by a different company and you pay an additional charge at the start or end of your journey to cover these charges. Please don't let this up you off, asit is the easiest way to travel.  The alternative from the airport is using the Arlanda  Express, it is nearer the airport terminal, and it leaves every 15 minutes and is quicker, taking 20 minutes. However it goes to Stockholm Central Station and from there you will need to change and use the local Metro. For the Metro from Stockholm City it is 3 stops to Mariatorget on the red line number 13 or 14. (The Metro is quite easy to use, each line has 2 numbers, one for each direction of travel, and additional numbers if the line splits, so you just need to know the direction you are making for and find what number that line is on, which I found easier than than trying to remember the names).  Mariatorget Metro station is literally round the corner from the hotel. It's on the same road as Sodra station but nearer to the hotel, with a two minute walk.  For both the commuter trains and Metro there were lifts (Hiss in Swedish) and in the carriages there were priority seats. I didn't notice any designated wheelchair spaces but I was always making for the nearest carriage, so I feel unable to comment on that. On board there are announcements in Swedish, and occassionally in English, there is also a board in each carriage and an announcment fro the next stop. The board shows or announces nasta (which is Swedish for next) and then it says the stop. Public transport is excellent and frequent.    My accessible room 310 had an accessible toilet. The grab rails were a little different from home as at the hands they were padded and when I pressed down to get up, the rails would press down a bit, this was extremely comfortable as it took took pressure on the pressing down but also felt safe. There was a telephone in the bathroom.  The communal accessible toilet on the ground floor also had grab rails, but these were static and didn't move when I pushed down. There was an automatic door to enter and exit.  Both accessible toilet areas were spacious and clean with grab rails."
hotel riviera beachotel benidorm,positive,The hotel gives you free parking in the hotel opposite for stays of 7 nights or more.  Tour companies provide transfers from the airport. Plenty of buses and taxis in Benidorm  Great facilities in the bedroom apart from the lack of a vertical grab rail beside the toilet. Good disabled toilets in reception and at the pool As I use a wheelchair I am unable to get on the transfer buses from the airport so we hired a car. The hotel provides free parking for stays of 7 nights or more. This is in the hotel opposite. There are plenty of buses and taxis in the area The bathroom in the bedroom is excellent - raised toilet seat with grab rails.  Shower is great with both fold down seat and shower stool. Even has the hairdryer at wheelchair level. Toilets in reception are disabled friendly. Toilets at pool area are disabled friendly with an accessible shower.
hotel scandic aarhus city aarhus,positive,"It has an in-door car park with lift access to hotel, but this cost. Opposite the hotel  a town car park has three free disabled spaces, this is of course accessable to everyone, so can get busy. Wheel in shower ( makes a mess on the floor)  Shower chair on request Toilet can be accessed from one side only"
hotel schani wien vienna,positive,"Hotel Schani is in a great location for public transport with Vienna’s Central Railway Station right across the street. Catching a tram, bus, train or U-Bahn (subway) is very easy from this hotel, located in the Belvedere Quarter. The tram (line D) is literally on the hotels doorstep. It will take you into the heart of Vienna city centre within 7 minutes. It was perfect! The hotel is a little bit too far from the centre to walk though, but with the public transport links being so good, you really don't have to worry about having to walk.  The accessible bathroom was spacious and I was able to move around easily. The sink was perfect as I was able to roll my wheelchair underneath without banging my knees. The position of the toilet was good - space on one side for wheelchair transferring. There was fold down grab bars for support. The roll-in shower also had grab bars, but unfortunately, there wasn’t a fixed shower seat or bench in the shower, but there was just a portable seat. The shower tray has the potential to be slippery, so I’d recommend you take care if standing in the shower.  "
hotel selfoss selfoss,negative,You have to be in your own car or a taxi to get there.
hotel sonnschein grafenweg,positive,"I'm giving it 5 stars as we never had trouble parking, but i'm not sure how many spaces there was as it was usually covered in snow. Giving it four as the toilets were very low.  However I had anticipated this and contacted the hotel in advance asking for a toilet seat raiser.  They were happy to help and got one brought in for me."
hotel verde cape town airport cape town,positive,There are disabled parking bays both in the basement parking and upstairs at the hotel entrance. I recommend parking in the basement if not for any reason other than to admire the graffiti art on the walls! There are wheelchair accessible bathrooms in the hotel and the univesally accessible suites have wheelchair-friendly bathrooms.
hotspot ess paradies manchester,negative,Parking is quite difficult in Chorlton as it is a small but busy village. There is parking available in the nearby streets. All pavements have ramped access in the area
hotter than hell tattoo edinburgh,negative,Buses stop on Home Street a few metres from the front door. Parking situation unknown as it is on the corner of a residential area and main road. 
houndshill shopping centre blackpool,negative,We arrived having come off the nearby bus service so it was quite handy. Close to the prom' and the tram service.
houndshill shopping centre blackpool,positive,We traveled by bus and there are several buses that go into town. Some stop closer to the shopping centre than others. There is a multistory car park which has both lifts and stairs to the different floors of the car park and to the shopping centre floor. There are several entrances to the centre and the majority if not all have disabled access. There is standard disabled toilets meaning it is just bigger than a usual toilet. There was no hoist and there was only a babies changing table. The toilet was clean. There is a large multi storey car par built on to this centre and a lift is available from the car park in to the centre its self. There are Blue Badge spaces available.   The Blackpool tram system nearest stop would be the tower this is a 5 min walk away from the centre its self. There are 2 wheelchair accessible toilets available these are on the 2nd floor the food court area .  There is are 2 lifts available from the middle of the centre to the food court area  However they 5 Stars are because the Debenhams store that is part of the Centre has a Changing place toilet available for use.
house for an art lover glasgow,negative,Parking for blue badge holders was in a separate area of the car park where there were three or four bays - not sure exactly how many as the signs and lines on the ground were confusing. You didn't know quite where you were supposed to park. The stone edging around the car park was not the kindest when trying to manouvre the wheelchairs on the the main drive. The access to the accessible toilet was along a corridor with a ninety degree turn to go in the door. It was clean and tidy but not the easiest to move around in with a powerchair. Signage was not immediately obvious.
house for an art lover glasgow,positive,Disabled parking bays in a designated area. Only sticking point may be the incline from the House to the spaces.
house of bruar pitlochry,negative,There was plenty of parking spaces.  There is a disabled loo just on the right hand side as you go into the loos (which are on the left hand side of the food shop as you enter).  It was clean but a bit cramped as its also a baby change. Its often busy too.
house of bruar pitlochry,positive,"There was plenty of parking spaces. The toilet was very accessible and clean .  The toilets were easy to find and clean The best way to get here is by car, there are a number of disabled parking bays at the front of the complex.  No coaches allowed . We went by car. There are several disabled car parking spaces but it's better to go when it's quiet as Bruar can get very busy and the disabled spaces fill up very quickly. Accessible toilet with other toilets and easy to find. it was quite small but adequate for wheelchair user and carer. It was very clean. Combined with baby changer. It was fine when Bruar was quiet but toilet area would be more congested when busy."
house of fraser cardiff,negative,Roomy accessible loo with rails (see pics). Broken red cord.  Hidden away on 3rd floor by lift and poorly signposted.
house of fraser glasgow,positive,"Frases are located mostly on Buchanan Street which is pedestrianised, though buses and the locality of both Glasgow Central, Queen Street stations and the underground is within 3 mins. Mitchell Street multi story car park is close by with area parking on St. Vincent Street, be aware Glasgow isa grid system City Center, so lots of one way traffic."
houses of parliament london,negative,"We stayed at the nearby Travelodge, Waterloo (see my review also on Euan's Guide), so it was just 10 mins ""rolling"" distance in our powerchairs as we went as a group. "
houses of parliament london,positive,"There was a lift down to the cafe and loo, clearly signposted. There was a commentary for people who are visually impaired. Space to manoeuvre or for a carer but not both. Clean and tidy. Westminster Station is just across the road and has step-free access to the Jubilee, District and Circle Lines. Brilliant accessible toilet (see attached photo below) behind the souvenir shop which you enter via a side-door in Westminster Hall. Everything in the toilet perfectly designed and laid out, and the red emergency cord was not tied up - five stars! It has a Changing Places loo which consist of a ceiling track hoist and adult size changing bench. So 5 stars for me!  We used a taxi because parking is a lottery and there was not point to point wheelchair access on the Tube. Signposted and easy to use, but used by non disabled people as well. Don't know about disabled parking (apparently you can reserve Blue Badge spots in Great College Street), but we walked down Whitehall from Charing Cross Station, and was pleasantly surprised by how relatively wheelchair friendly Whitehall is - lots of smooth dropped curbs and wide pavements. There are some nastier curbs getting round the south side of Trafalgar Square and over the top of Westminster Bridge was crowded, but overall pretty good. Westminster Underground is step free and right along from the visitors entrance. Standard disabled toilets through the cafe at the beginning and end. Not sure about what would have happened if you needed them half way through the tour."
housesteads roman fort bardon mill,negative,Blue badge spaces nearest visitor centre.  Long walk up to the fort itself but on request you  can drive up if preferred.  There's still a bit of a walk from the parking by the museum to the fort however there's a level path.
housesteads roman fort bardon mill,positive,Nice loo in visitor centre. Only drawback  was double heavy doors to reach it!
hovertravel ryde,positive,"Plenty of well planned parking space and ramp access available. None on the hovercraft but it's only a 10 minute flight to Southsea. Facilities in the terminal are good. Public car park straight opposite Southsea Easy to find and accessible in Ryde for me. Not sure on Southsea side. Well marked disabled parking, close to the terminal entrance. Bus station within sight of the terminal. Taxi rank close by. We didn't actually use the facility. But it is available. There was a proper disabled toilet at the hovercraft report on the Isle of Wight i got a taxi and it was lots of space to load and unload both sides very clean and tidy "
howard park letchworth garden city,positive,There is car park adjacent to the park which makes it easy to get to the park. Level paths /ramps throughout. There is a disabled toilet in this park in the same building as the cafe kiosk.
howgate shopping centre falkirk,negative,"Toilets smell funny Expensive. Signage to get to it can be a bit confusing. Often blue badge bays used by parent and toddlers when their spaces are full. No extra time allowed for blue  badge holders. You only have 10 minutes to get from the pay station in the shopping centre to the exit of the car park or the automatic barrier won't let you out. Not easy to do when you have to dismantle a wheelchair, stow it away, get your shopping in and wait for the lift to get down to the car park."
howgate shopping centre falkirk,positive,Could do with few more
howies bistro perth,positive,"Didn't drive there, went from st johns centre Good, was situated up a ramp"
howies edinburgh,negative,"There is little more than a drop-off zone immediately outside the venue but if you are quick , it is possible to park on the yellow lines using a blue badge.  However a good bus route runs nearby, and it is a short walk from the City Centre. Rather awkward to get to and into but once inside - perfectly satisfactory.  Decent size, clean and well appointed."
huasquila amazon lodge cotundo,negative,I’ve given a low rating for transport because I flew from Heathrow Terminal 5 and the special assistance was so poor that I missed my first flight. On the way back they abandoned me at baggage collection so I had to walk out with my luggage and rollator on a trolley .
huasquila amazon lodge cotundo,positive,"All toilets were accessible, no alarm cords."
hub by premier inn edinburgh haymarket edinburgh,positive,"The hotel was just a few minutes walk from Haymarket train station (0.4 miles). It is only 1 mile from Edinburgh castle and central transportation links. They do not have a car park The door to the bathroom was a sliding door which was great for space and ease of access, the doorway was wide. We had an accessible shower (wet room), there were grab rails and a red cord, the toilet and sink were low and there was a sink bench for putting items on. The sinks had a lever tap and there was a folding shower seat. It was very clean. Had no experience of parking ( you are best using public transport in Edinburgh). Hotel is a short push from Edinburgh Haymarket station. Slightly uphill but i managed myself and im not that fit - all easy dropped kerbs.  Haymarket station is one stop from Edinburgh Waverley ( which is right in city centre). No trouble at all with 5 min train ride. Easy to get round in wheelchair. Toilet a reasonable wheelchair height, lots of handrails. Easy to get under sink."
hub by premier inn london westminster london,positive,You couldn't do much better without upgrading to a Changing Places format
huddersfield art gallery huddersfield,positive,roomy disabled loo...radar key...no changing places loo
hug cafe glasgow,positive,Lots of room and very clean.
hula juice bar healthy eatery edinburgh,negative,"There is an accessible toilet however this is currently being used as a cleaning closet also. The child/baby changing table has lots of cleaning products under it, which I found to be quite unsafe. There is also boxes and a ‘hoover’ lying about which is a massive trip hazard. The red cord also doesn’t reach the floor - another hazard! "
hula juice bar healthy eatery edinburgh,positive,The bus stop is right outside the door - on street parking is available round a close corner - not sure about on street parking.
hull maritime museum hull,positive,"while the museum does not have a car park, due to its location, parking and transport links are available and access friendly."
hull paragon interchange railway and bus station hull,positive,280 car park spaces and 18 accessible spaces available. Wheelchair users can use the car park equipment at this station unaided. Detailed information available on the website. There is one disabled toilet available however it does not have any changing facilities available or national key toilets. 
hungry bear ryde,negative,"The venue is found just before St Helens Village and is on a bus route with an hourly bus service. It is reached by way of a small winding, uphill lane from the main road. Arriving by car is easier and there is a good sized carpark. "
hunscote farm shop wellesbourne,negative,"The parking area was quite big, concrete floor and tidy enough,  it no disabled spots, but very few use it, so no problems. No cafe, and no toilet seen."
hunter square edinburgh,negative,"Access to the Square is very pedestrian orientated. It's a short distance, a few metres, from the Royal Mile."
hunters moon sidmouth,positive,"We were able to park just outside entrance to our room. Disabled facilities in 4 rooms, good public disabled toilet. Well signposted, easy to find."
huntly castle huntly,negative,"Probably the worst part of my visit. The receptionist gave us a code which we were to use for gaining access to the toilet. I didn't really agree with this as it would've been tricky to enter the code on my own. The disabled toilets are in the middle of nowhere. When you get into the toilet you will see that there isn't a red cord! Why, why, why. For example, if I fell inside the toilet am I supposed to scream in the hope someone heard me? Really didn't understand the thought process on this one. First time inside Britain seeing no red cord in a disabled loo. Speechless. Unfortunately these were all out of order. "
huntly castle huntly,positive,"I wouldn't recommend getting here by train as the castle is outside of Huntly beside Huntly golf course so you would need a taxi.  It is quite easy to arrive here by car. There are 2 disabled car parking spaces directly outside the reception.  Really good! You get to drive through an old gated archway, down a tree lined drive and there are accessible parking bays right outside the ticket office."
hutchesons bar and brasserie glasgow,negative,"We got the train into Glasgow Queen Street and it is about 10 mins walk from there - very near to the Modern Art Gallery. There are some public car parks nearby that have blue badge spaces. Transport by car to the venue was OK but it was a busy street and not the best for dropping off. That said, the approach along the pavement from the bus stops was fine. Several of my group walked across (two wheelchair users) from Queen Street station and it was surprisingly close and easy to get to."
hutchesons bar and brasserie glasgow,positive,"On street parking on the streets around the restaurant and a car park with a few minutes walk. Good size - spotlessly clean and tidy - accessed via the lift. The accessible loo was large, very well appointed, and didn't feel like the usual accessible toilets you meet that seem like an afterthought. It was spotlessly clean and and large enough for me to turn my powerchair full circle; not always possible."
huttons shoe repair service edinburgh,negative,Plenty of buses from Easter Road and residential parking around it.
hyde park london,positive,There is a car park on the public road through the park with parking for the disabled. The car park is right next to the Serpentine and there is a great drink and snack kiosk a few yards away
hydro at the barn clayton le moors,positive,really easy if you drive good sized toilet
hythe bay at dover seafood restaurant and bar dover,positive,"Parking right outside Will need access code from staff, excellent facilities"
i leoni vienna,positive,Can't comment on the parking. U Bahn Line 3 gets you right there - get off at the station called Gasometer. It's fully accessible and you come out just outside Gasometer A.
i need a holiday too la roche derrien,positive,"Plenty of onsite parking Huge wetrooms with shower, roll under sink, and plenty of grabrails. Plenty of available parking. Wet room meant no issues with access and it was very spacious. There is ample parking but no public transport  There is plentiful parking on site, and Jacqui/Carl will give details of car parks wherever you go.  They will drive you anywhere if needed. It's huge! They have a large car park,  and we booked berths on the ferry. Brittany Ferries cater very well for disabled access Plenty of space in bathrooms. There is a very large  car park , plenty of  space  for all sizes of transport. The French do not tolerate anyone , who is not disabled and displaying a blue badge to park in a designated disabled place. We have a large hydraulic rear ramp van and never have any trouble parking at anywhere we wish to go. Totally accessible  toilets in all flats in an enormous bathroom. Lots of room for hoists etc. Plenty of disabled secure parking for customers vehicles and should you require transport hire it can readily be arranged. Perfectly accessible toilets / wet room all fully equipped with grab rails etc very clean and spacious. Brittany Ferries are good and getting better, large car park at INAHT Very large wetrooms, grab rails for toilet. I drove, level private parking at venue.   Local airport, owner help to collect you in her vehicle Large wet room shower, wash hand basin and toilet from memory (2010) before Euan Guide, I found no problem. The owner had a good supply of aids to help."
iain burnett highland chocolatier pitlochry,negative,"The customer car park is unfortunately a loose stone surface, but there is on street parking right beside the entrance too. From the car park, there is a dropped kerb to a level access outside patio into the chocolate Lounge. From the street, there is a smooth, gentle stone path down to the door. "
ibis styles birmingham nec and airport hotel birmingham,positive,"Onsite carpark with 5 accessible bays near the front door.  This was a major plus as many of the hotels I looked at in Birmingham relied on you parking in a public carpark. The ensuite was everything I needed. Toilet was nice and high, plenty of space to manoeuvre and warm."
ibis styles glasgow centre west glasgow,negative,There is some on street parking at the side of the hotel but it is very expensive during the day. Try to find out position for blue badge holders. Free from 6 pm to 8 am. Hotel has deals with various car parks but prices vary. Watch out for dedicated cycle way  between pavement and road. Waterloo Street is on bus routes for airport and long distance destination s but it is a one way street leading out of town.
ibis styles glasgow centre west glasgow,positive,As above
ibis styles london leyton hotel london,negative,"There's disabled parking at the hotel, fee for £5 per day you stay.  Train isn't accessible - nearest one is Stratford Underground which is accessible by the bus at the top of the road and is an hour from the hotel.   So it gets a 2 from me, who in their right minds wants to get up an extra hour earlier just to make sure that they can get the bus. For an accessible room there are no grab rails, no emergency cords and the shower facilities at a 45degree angle which have no support when wet and no shower seat or grab rails in the shower leave a lot to be desired."
ibrox stadium glasgow,negative,Quite dated and definitely lacking space..
ibrox stadium glasgow,positive,"We were parked in the car parking accross from Ibrox, their were lots of car parking spaces for people with a disability Their is a disabiled toilet just outside of the main room what is really good  Disabled parking was available directly across the road from the stadium and there looked as though there were also a couple of disabled parking bays actually within the complex. Clean and easily accessed. There was a wheelchair ramp or 3 steps from the area I was seated in (GE03) to the toilets."
ice cube skating rink leeds,positive,Toilets fab they have a changing place For 2 adults I don’t know whether or not there was an accessible toilet.
ice factor kinlochleven,positive,"Parking right outside the door. We drove - I imagine getting there by public transport a whole other issue! Right by the cafe and it is easy to find, easy to access, and clean and tidy. Was interested to see that the Ice Factor was proudly signposted as a Highland Comfort Public Convenience too - what a great scheme!"
iceland derby,positive,Trent Barton (i4 & Indigo) buses go past regularly.  Accessible parking pays outside the store. 
iceland paisley,positive,there is accessible parking on first floor of car park
ifly indoor skydiving stretford,positive,"Drove straight into the disabled section of the car park.   The whole car park is on the level  and , therefore,  available for disabled parking when necessary.   The disabled toilet is sutured in reception.  It is very spacious, clean and tidy."
ightham mote sevenoaks,positive,Plenty of disabled parking spaces and a shuttle buggy to take you to the house if required. Two toilets at different locations. Clean and easy to reach everything.
ikea giltbrook,negative,Parking is limited outside the store but there are other stores close by Toilets are good. Radar key needed be aware.well set out. Room. To move
ikea glasgow,positive,"Fantastic! Plenty of spaces with lots of room to get in and out the car. Again, very spacious. The only issue is that they are at the end of the store so it is quite a trip from one end of the building to the other. The disabled toilets were of average size and the red cords were hanging freely It would be excellent to see a changing place toilet installed."
ikea loanhead,positive,"Easy to park if coming by car. Not so obvious if you arrive by bus. Ramp down from the bus stop is quite steep. Route to store front is not signposted. Full marks for the toilets. There are several loos and there's also a Changing Places toilet. The toilets were very spacious, well equipped, and spotlessly clean. Disabled bays at the right of the entrance, in they're own disabled parking area. Very convenient.   Accessible toilets easy to find. Enough space to manoeuvre myself and a power chair user. Also a changing places disabled toilet. All toilets kept very clean, very good access with changing places toilet!   Great large area allocated for disabled people near the entrance.  We get the bus, and always tend to get the wrong one, but this time we got the right one, you want to get the X37 or the 47 that go straight past Ikea, the 37 kinda goes an awkward route around it.  We drove to IKEA and there were clearly signed, large accessible parking bays near the entrance. We also had to visit the warehouse to pick up more things (because you can never buy just one thing in IKEA!) and there was an accessible parking space right beside the door plus a ramp leading straight up to the collection point. On approaching the customer toilets the first sign I saw was for a Changing Places loo which was great. The toilets themselves were very clean and spacious. There were loads of accessible parking bays near the entrance. I believe buses stop nearby also as there is a Costco and ASDA close by too its a busy area. I used the Changing Places loo which was great. There are two red cords which I carded and really liked the sink which I can roll under. There is also a smaller accessible toilet nearby but I haven’t been in so can’t comment on accessibility. In front of entrance Available on both the lower and upper levels, large and clean. We arrived at IKEA by car.  The car park is huge.  Fortunately there are signs to direct people to the disabled bays. There are 10 disabled bays just beside the entrance to IKEA.  See photo . There are also many more disabled parking bays a little further away.   Spacious  disabled toilet but no  emergency red cord .  See photo  Very accessible loos.  Lots of grab rails.  There was a notice saying the there was changing places loo on the ground floor. There are disabled parking bays at the front of the building with plenty of space for getting in/out of the car. There is also a dropped curb from the parking bay area onto the path.  There is a changing places toilet at the entrance, which had everything you need as well as a clos-o-mat toilet - amazing. There is also an accessible toilet upstairs next to the restaurant and one at the exit. "
ikea milton keynes,negative,Not enough - 20+ disabled parking spaces but only 2 accessible loos.
ikea milton keynes,positive,Disabled parking was well signed with plenty of spaces available
ikea southampton,positive,disabled parking is located on ground floor -spots are spacious which is good for mini buses. If there are no disabled spots there is plenty of normal spots near the lifts to entrance large disabled toilets located on several floors including entrance and restaurant.
il pirata belfast,negative,"Not too sure, we drove here and parked around the corner. Good they had an accessible loo but you needed two hands to close it, I couldn't close it."
il vecchio adeje,positive,Big empty loo with limited grab rails. Very clean.
ile saint honorat cannes,positive,"Boats to Saint-Honorat leave regularly throughout the year from Vieux Port at Cannes. There is step free access and spaces for wheelchair users. The boat trip takes about 15 minutes but check the schedule for the last boat of the day and be mindful there is a gap in the schedule over the lunchtime. On route to the island there are impressive views of La Croisette and the French Riviera coastline. Please note tickets for the ferry can be bought online or at the kiosk at Vieux Port, which is accessible via stairs, although there is a step free route to boarding the bus. I visited in early October  and was surprised at the length of the queue to buy or collect tickets for the boat ride. I was worried that I would miss my planned boat (they are only once every hour) but the boat waited until everyone who was travelling was aboard so it left a few minutes late. This was my experience so don't assume they will do that when you are wanting to travel so please arrive early. On the Cannes side the ticket kiosk and boat are located through a car park, just off a road where buses go by."
illegal jacks edinburgh,negative,The accessible loo had a lot of other stuff in it and the cord was wrapped up around a handle. It wasn't very accessible at all.
impangele guest house swellendam,positive,"Even though the parking area is paved with loose stones, you can park very close to the ramp! Ask for the Zebra room when booking!"
imperial war museum duxford duxford,negative,We need the facilities of a Cp toilet so all other disabled loos were there but not checked by myself.  I was surprised Duxford didn’t have a CP toilet - I really thought there would be one hiding somewhere! It just feels like they’ve thought of everything else! It’s only downside to a second visit I’m afraid.
imperial war museum duxford duxford,positive,Parking is just outside the main entrance with a short walk to the first hanger.
imperial war museum london,negative,"I only used 1 of the 8 toilets labelled as wheelchair accessible. This one was in a quiet 'out the back' hallway on an upper floor.  The transfer space was in front of the door.  On arrival we were immediately told about toilets being on all floors. Unfortunately none have a hoist or changing bench. Entry and exit from the toilet was difficult because of the door and door grab rail.  All grab rails were present but no shelf or coat hook. Their was a general waste bin (not really needed and taking up space) but no Hygiene bins for continence pads. Although labelled as baby changing, there was no table inside. It was in the ladies toilet area, so I did not use it"
imperial war museum london,positive,There is blues badge parking in site which you must book in advance but it is also only 10/12 minutes/push from Waterloo station. The Imperial War Museum website is very helpful and easy to follow. There are. Two large accessible toilets under the main staircase (male and female) and 8 further toilets. see website map. I used public transport to get tp  and from the venue.
imperial war museum london london,negative,"There are several accessible toilet and in 2020, the museum installed a changing places toilet. There are wheelchair symbols for the accessible toilets but there is no signage for the changing places toilet apart from on its door. The changing places toilet is next to the men's toilet on level 0. A radar key is needed to open the door. On the day I visited the staff did not know where the radar key was. There is an accessible toilet, sink, bench, hoist, free standing screen, grab rails. The emergency cord hangs loose but does not reach the floor. There instructions for the hoist were on a laminated card sitting on top of one of the bins. It would be more helpful if this was on a wall in large print.  THERE WAS NO SOAP OR EVEN A SOAP DISPENSER.   This made me feel very upset. We are in the middle of a pandemic and there has been so much emphasis on hands, face, space. It appears not to apply for disabled visitors at the IWM. On exiting the changing places door didn’t lock behind me. I had to use my key to secure it.   The IWM London’s press statement when the changing places toilet was opened it quotes Laura Crean, Assistant Director, Strategy and Governance, said: “We are delighted to be opening a brand new Changing Places toilet at IWM London. This new facility will ensure that we have adequate, clean and safe facilities for all of IWM London’s visitors and will therefore substantially improve the visitor experience to our museum. IWM is committed to removing and reducing barriers to make IWM open to everyone, whether those barriers are cultural, social, attitudinal, physical or educational. Installing a Changing Places toilet at IWM London is one step forward to reducing those barriers.”   Having a changing places toilet is not enough in itself. On the day I visited unless a disabled person had their own radar key they would not have been able to get in and use the facility. There is no point having a changing places toilet, if staff don't have access to a radar key and disabled people are prevented from gaining admission. It then just becomes lip service, a box ticket, but without any genuine commitment to ensuring our dignity, independence or safety.   Organisations need to advertise their changing places toilets, they are a real asset, it will bring in more visitors, clear signage will make it easier for disabled people to locate it, staff need accessibility training and be able to locate radar key(s) promptly so disabled people can quickly assess toileting facilities safely that meet their access needs. Going to the effort of installing a changing places toilet, and no one thinking of including a soap dispenser, shows a lack of thought, and now given the hands, face, space messages of covid is negligent.  I’ve checked the changing place’s website map and the IWM London’s toilet does not feature on the map, which raises the question whether or not it has been registered and details submitted. "
imperial war museum london london,positive,"The Imperial War Museum London is near to Lambeth North, Elephant and Castle and Waterloo Tube Stations, none of which are step free. The nearest train station is Waterloo which does have step free access. There are a few buses that stop close by to the museum. We travelled on the bus number 59 from Euston Station. We exited at Kennington Road/  Imperial War Museum stop. From there we entered Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, see photo, in whose grounds the museum is located.  Accessible toilets available, very spacious and clean, easily sign posted. "
imperial war museum north stretford,positive,"I'm not sure able public transport however there's a very large car park right outside which wasn't even half full on a Saturday afternoon.  Whilst the museum is free, parking isn't and my partner found the machine to pay didn't work very well if you didn't have exact change. Staff at reception were able to help with this and there was an attendant in the far corner of the car park which we only spotted after we'd resolved it! Other than that, getting there was very easy. There were several large unlocked disabled toilets with great facilities and were clean."
in safe hands childcare renfrew,positive,If you drove there is parking right outside. If you got a bus you would need to walk a tiny bit down the road. There was a loo and it is easily found and it had loads of room to move about .
inch beach ardroe,positive,There was an accessible loo inside Sammy's: clean with OK rails but a bit small for wheelchair manoeuvring.
inchture hotel inchture,negative,"No disabled parking spaces, no lined spaces at all, very uneven ground No accessible toilet upstairs. In the conservatory there was a good sized accessible toilet, clean and tidy, sink at good height but light is very high up. "
inchture hotel inchture,positive,"There is quite a lot of parking but the hotel is very busy and there isn't a designated disabled space. However, we have always been able to park close to the ramp at the side of the hotel, and position the car, allowing adequate space The accessible toilet is a good size"
india quay glasgow,negative,Don't think there was any. 
indigo yard edinburgh,negative,There's no real parking options but it's not too far from Princes Street or Shandwick Place where you can catch a bus or tram to. 
indodrill stadium alloa,negative,We parked on a public street about 200 metres from the ground. It's a small ground and parking's available first come first served. It's a decent well equipped accessible toilet. The only problem is that it's about 100 metres from the viewing area.
inglestone house kelso,negative,I saw no specific disabled parking for the hotel. We were able to always park near to the rear of the hotel.
inglestone house kelso,positive,"There is usually parking space on the road outside the front entrance, but there is a car park across the churchyard, the latter of which has a good path across it suitable for a wheelchair.  There is a disabled parking space opposite for unloading, but I believe it is a short stay parking space.  Wheelchair users need to be aware that the main square in Kelso is cobbled, but there are paved areas to the side for wheelchairs. The bathroom is enormous so there is plenty of space for a carer, and there are grab rails in the bathroom.  Re the actual shower: users would have to be able to get into the shower cubicle which is a standard size. Big, en suite, with all the handles and standing aids supplied."
inn on the green brockham,negative,There is one large accessible toilet. This was clean. Only 3 stars because the door opened inwards and it was not possible to turnaround which meant exiting the toilet virtually impossible. After 5 attempts at holding the door and trying to reverse I phoned one of my friends at the table to rescue me.
inn on the green brockham,positive,You need your own transport but there are 3 disabled parking spaces set. The car park is gravel which did make it difficult to traverse in wheelchair.
inn on the prom hotel lytham saint annes,negative,There are 4 or 5 Blue Badge spaces available these are near to the wheelchair access point of the hotel The nearest public transport is about 10mins away buses to Blackpool Fleetwood etc.  There was one wheelchair toilet available it was however difficult to find not good signage it is near the reception area. There is a large square area being used to display booklets about the hotel just off the reception area and the wheelchair toilet is in this area.  There is a grip rail on the left hand side as you it on the toilet and there is room for a care giver to help if required   
inner city sanctum edinburgh,negative,Regular buses up and down Leith Walk. East-bound stop just a few doors up. Taxi can drop off close by (some naughty taxi drivers will even stop on the zig zags directly outside!) Tiny and not wheelchair accessible. Access from treatment room if required.
innocent railway tunnel edinburgh,negative,"Transport links are not great. The Holyrood Park entrance is within a modern housing estate and parking is for residents only. The nearest parking is on Holyrood Park Road, this is mostly single yellow line with some pay and display parking spaces. At the Holyrood Park side the nearest bus stops are at the Commonwealth Pool on Dalkeith Road. The number 2,14, 30 and 33 buses go past here. The Duddingston side ends at Duddingston Road West, there is a bus stop nearby called Cavalry Park, this used to be part of the 42 route, but I am not sure if that is still the case. Again, parking options aren't great on this side either. The best option for parking on this side is probably at Peffermill Industrial Estate."
insole court cardiff,negative,loo in courtyard and main house
insotel club tarida playa ibiza,negative,Parking in small car park at the front of the hotel. Our main struggle was accessible transfers from airport. We booked through a travel agent but with some research may have been able to find accessible transfers.
insotel club tarida playa ibiza,positive,Accessible toilet in both our room and the pool area. Lots of space and grab rails.
institut du monde arabe paris,negative,"There were allegedly accessible loos on all the floors we visited, but the Institute's idea of an accessible loo is a large room with a low level toilet at one end, an accessible washbasin at the other and no grab rails or alarm system. Side transfer would in theory be possible but difficult, perhaps even dangerous in the absence of grab rails. Wheelchair user and accompanist really struggled to make use of this facility, and there was no loo paper."
institut du monde arabe paris,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Buses 24, 63, 67, 86, 87 and 89 will get you there from different parts of the city, and the Institute is centrally located on the left bank of the Seine."
institute for marine mammal studies gulfport,positive,Disabled parking on flat smooth area close to the entrance. No public transport.  Loo fine but doors too heavy. It was busy enough for there to be people around to help. 
institute of contemporary arts london,negative,"The nearest step-free station is Green Park, which is on the other side of (erm) Green Park, i.e. a considerable distance away (more than 15 minutes walk/roll). The nearest place for buses to drop you off is Trafalgar Square, about five minutes away. Of course parking in the Mall is completely impossible - but there are multi-layered car parks in various places in the West End, which is near by."
institute of contemporary arts london,positive,"There is an accessible toilet near the main entrance. It's a bit too small, and there were large rubbish bins in the wheelchair transfer area, which is annoyingly thoughtless."
institute of education london,negative,"Jeffery Hall is on Level 1 of the building. There are male and female toilets there. There is a sign saying that the accessible toilet is on Level 4 via the lift. For a 320 seater events venue I feel it is blatant failure of reasonable adjustments and clear disability discrimination. No events venue would be designed without non accessible toilets near by. Could you imagine what it would be like if every person wanted the toilet had to take the lift to 3 floors up, there would be an outrage. As a disabled person I felt very angry, especially given that there are some disabled people who would not be able to hold their bladder or bowl movement long enough to take the lift to the 4th floor.    By the break time when I needed to use the toilet only 2 of the 3 lifts were working, and this remained the situation for the rest of the day. The lifts serve 9 floors. At the mid morning break I had to wait about 5 minutes for the lift to arrive. Other times the wait was a lot less.  When I got to Level 4 I followed the signs to the accessible toilet. I had to navigate a manual door to get to the entrance of the accessible toilet.   The accessible toilet door had a very low lock. I have a back problem and it was difficult for me to bend to such a low level to close and open the door. The toilet was spacious, clean, with grab rail and an emergency cord that reached to the ground."
institute of education london,positive,"The nearest tube stations are Russell Square or Euston, neither of which offer step free access. There are a number of bus routes that stop close by. The nearest step free tube is King's Cross from which you could take a bus."
intercontinental edinburgh the george edinburgh,negative,"Parking is difficult and not close enough, so we arrived by public bus service, which stops very close to the hotel. We managed to return to our hotel by my wife pushing me along and downhill for the shortish ride to Princess Street, however, the bus stop is next to this hotel."
intercontinental singapore,positive,We took an accessible cab to and from the airport and MRT in between. Cab cost is S$50 per trip regardless of distance. MRT is fabulous and population extremely helpful.
internal fire museum ceredigion,positive,There is hard standing for parking but no team arts spaces or spaces actually for disabled vehicles but if you have mobility issues or a disability you can park close to the building and then speak to Hazel or Paul who are the couple who run the museum. The museum has two toilets and one is designated disabled but the other one is actually large enough for a wheelchair as well as a clean well presented and perfectly suitable.
international bomber command centre lincoln,positive,There are a limited number of disabled parking spaces (about 7). But the parking is only a short walk away from the centre. There is some gravel in the car park which may make it a little bit bumpy but it is not too difficult. At least not for a Powerchair.  
international slavery museum liverpool,negative,There are 3 Blue badges spaces about 150 yards away as the museum web site tells you however this is a very popular venue and these do fill up quickly even when the schools are in as was the case during our visit. The nearest public Transport is some distance away outside the gates of the Albgreeert docks and as a result is a good bit to walk 
international slavery museum liverpool,positive,There are Wheelchair accessible Toilets on all the floors so you are always near one at all times the museum also has  a fantastic Changing Places Toilet this is on the 2nd floor and is at the far end of the exhibition area if you turn left as you come out of the lift. We were however disappointed at the lack of signage for the Changing Places Toilet in the area it is located.  A radar Key is required for the toilets  Disabled parking was readily available for those which required it in nearby carparks. The accessible toilets on every floor which looked spacious.
intersport peterhead,negative,"Bus route into town with stop nearby, on street (free) parking to front, small car park to rear (no disabled spaces though) "
intu braehead glasgow,positive,"There are plenty of disabled parking spaces available in all of the car parks at Braehead. There are various car parks around the centre for easy access to certain parts of the centre. There are various toilets located around the centre and there are disabled toilets present at each set. The clean and tidy toilets have lots of space to manoeuvre and have grab rails. There is also enough room for a carer in each. I travelled by public transport, which was very easy. The bus stop was in the main car park of Braehead. Lots of toilets available which were accessible. Had everything I needed."
intu brierley hill,positive,There are lots of disabled parking spots and buses to the centre There are lots of toilets through out the centre which are accessible.
intu broadmarsh nottingham,positive,"Broadmarsh has it's own multi-storey car park location just next to the centre, which has a number of disabled car parking spaces. There is also Broadmarsh bus station where all major bus routes stop at, this is located in the underground of the centre, with a level access available. Nottingham train station is also less than 5 minute walk away. Disabled toilets are available in the centre. They are located on level 2, along with the rest of the toilets."
intu chapelfield norwich,positive,"Lots of parking at the mall including Blue Badge spaces. There is also a Shopmobility area with parking . Ample blue badge parking spots are available on site, as well as parking spaces for those who may not have a blue badge. Shopmobility facilities are located in the car park in short distance from the lifts, and can be easily accessed by automatic doors. Multiple sets of lifts are available on every floor of the car park, leading directly up into the shopping centre or into House of Fraser Both RADAR and regular accessible toilets are available on the lower floor. On the dining terrace, there are both accessible toilets and Changing Places facilities. The RADAR toilets are always very clean and tidy, with plenty of space for a wheelchair or other large aid and a carer. There are grab rails, including a fold-down rail by the side of the toilet"
intu gateshead,negative,There is a massive car park. 
intu gateshead,positive,There was a massive car park. 
intu metrocentre,positive,"Every car park has dedicated blue badge bays. Regular bus services, most buses are accessible. There is also a rail link. Changing Places facilities: Bench - Height Adjustable, Adult Sized, Free Standing Hoist - Ceiling Peninsular Toilet Washbasin Height Adjustable Managed"
intu potteries shopping centre stoke on trent,positive,"We drove to the Intu Potteries, there is a multi-storey car park connected to the shopping centre which has disabled parking spaces on each level. These spaces are located near the entrances of the shopping centre to allow easy access. There are frequent buses which go through the city centre and stop outside the Intu Potteries. There are two bus stops, both situated by entrances of the shopping centre. There are disabled toilets which are located on the top level of the shopping centre, there are two lifts to access the top level. The toilets are regularly checked and cleaned and have plenty of space to allow easy access in and out of the toilets. Also there are grab rails inside the toilets. "
intu stretford,positive,"Radar key needed. However, if you don't have one the staff who look after the toilets have one and are usually on hand. I have one, but 80% of the time a member of staff has offered to unlock it for me before I have got my key out. The air fresheners in the toilets are a little strong at times, so if you are chemically sensitive you might want to use the toilets at John Lewis and Debenhams (either end). However the toilet with the hoist I believe, is central. Plenty  of disabled spaces near doors. Brilliant I was able to hoist and change my 7 year old son with ease. Facilities  like these are few and far between. On arrival at the intu Trafford Centre we were in a car. The route can get busy especially in rush hour traffic therefore it's worth considering the times of travel. There is plenty of parking, all which is free. Disabled parking spaces are positioned by the lift and there are many of them, especially if arrival time is earlier in the day. The toilets were of a high standard. They were spacious, clean and there was plenty of them. There was a disabled toilet which had plenty of room and grab rails included. Toilets are the best for accessibility in the area. A changing table and hoist, clos o mat toilet are in the bathroom but you do need a radar key. It has free parking with plenty of disabled parking spaces beside the many entrances which all have a lift for access into the building. Also there is a bus station located on the side of the building with regular buses which come from across Manchester. There are toilets available everywhere across the mall which are all clean and tidy with easy access. They include grab rails and pull cords if needed and a member of staff is almost always there available to help. There are clear signs to show where the toilets are. There are plenty of disabled parking spaces. However we parked in the ""shopmobilty"" area thinking this would be the most suitable for wheelchairs. The spaces are a distance from the entrance. There is also a high curb meaning you have to go right to the other side of the car park and then back down in the middle of the road taxis use. Not fun in the rain and dangerous. As you would expect the shopping center has excellent public transport links. Disabled toilets require a Radar key which means disabled people actually get to use them. However if you haven't got one it appears you have no choice but to buy one from customer services. There is also only one per area so again there is a wait and must be worse when busy."
invercarse hotel dundee,positive,"We went by car so unable to comment on public transport.  3 disabled spaces near reception then another couple outside the disabled rooms.  Great bathroom in the room with grab rails and excellent wheel in shower with shower chair. Took half a star off as no red cord and the mirror is too high for someone in a wheelchair  The Invercarse Hotel has great accessible parking, especially for being a hotel. There are 4 accessible parking spaces beside the main entrance and there is also an accessible parking space outside each accessible bedroom.   Dundee train station is roughly a 7-minute drive away from the Invercarse Hotel and there are plenty of taxis around Dundee. Buses also go by the Invercarse Hotel frequently as it is situated on the Perth Road which is a main road that runs from the city centre. The accessibility toilet in the main area of the hotel is quite small, with a large bin infront of the sink, which may cause problems for people transfer from a wheelchair and also needing assistance from someone they are with.   The shower room in the accessible rooms however are really spacious and have plenty of room for guests to transfer on their own or with someone assisting them. The shower screen is able to be moved for easy access and even though the sink isn’t height adjustable, there is plenty of space underneath to allow someone in a wheelchair to get under.  The only problem I could see when I visited the accessible bedroom was that the toilet was not in the middle of the wall in the shower room which could cause problems as guests would only be able to transfer at the right-hand side of the toilet."
inverewe garden estate inverewe garden nts,negative,"Plenty parking and accessible spaces. The accessible toilets in the main reception/shop were very poor as they were difficult to negotiate to get in, then once there, I was unable to get my chair in. The accessible toilet in the restaurant was adequate."
inverewe garden estate inverewe garden nts,positive,There is a large car park with disabled parking near the entrance to the Gardens and also outside the Restaurant. Ramps to get into restaurant
inverleith park edinburgh,negative,Limited on street parking at the entrances to the park. Public transport is some distance away.
inverness botanic gardens inverness,negative,Getting to the Botanic Gardens was for us more by accident than any effort of planning! We had walked along the riverside walkway from the town centre. The nearby road seemed quite busy and there were signs of buses going along. For the motorists there was plenty of parking in the area.
inverness bus station inverness,negative,Very old-fashioned. Beware if you are not in a chair as you are unfortunately to have an 'invisible' disability as you will most likely be challenges as to why you are using the accessible loo.
inverness bus station inverness,positive,It's a bus station so that's obviously the best way to get there!  There are at least 3  Blue Badge spaces outside the library which is about 50 metres from the bus station.
inverness film festival inverness,positive,"The theatre is located in the town centre and has great parking available with disabled spaces to the front and side; parking is free in the disabled spaces.  It's a short walk from the nearest bus-stop and about 10 minutes walk from the Inverness Train station. There are three accessible toilets on the ground floor and more upstairs.  The ones I've seen are spacious, accessible with grab rails, red cords and they are clean."
inverness leisure inverness,positive,"Disabled spaces close to venue, usually free during the day. Good facilities : hoist, height adjustable changing Bed and sink, shower, grab rails and lots of space. However, frequently no blue roll or soap, and on at least two occasions the changing bed or toilet have had faecal matter caked on (which to be fair I reported and it was cleaned). Hygiene bin overflowing with waste not very nice either."
inverness railway station inverness,positive,There is a car park at the front of the train station but I usually use the big car park at the side of the train station. I would recommend using this car park as the disabled car parks are nice and spacious. 
inverness youth hostel inverness,positive,"I went to Inverness by train.  From Euston there is no need to change trains if you take the overnight train. From the station I wheelchaired to the hostel. I personally would not have managed the last 200m hill in a self-propel, but the rest of the 1km (very approx) was on the level. Parking if you need it was plentiful at the hostel, which is next to Millburn Academy"
inveruglas visitor centre arrochar,positive,There is a large car park with only 3 blue badge spaces but they have a very good view of the loch. The accessible toilet is reached by a very gentle slope from the car park. There is a very large entrance to all the toilets and the accessible toilet itself is one of the most spacious I have ever seen. I don't think there is a red cord but this is understandable as this is not a staffed facility.
inverurie garden centre inverurie,positive,"One spacious parking space right at the entrance. Many others close by but they aren't any wider than the regular spaces. Train station just around the corner. Definitely accessible but as with many disabled toilets in Aberdeenshire, no red cord!"

isle of wight donkey sanctuary wroxall,negative,"Flat parking area but on large gravel, perfect for embedding your wheels into. I managed to back wheel balance myself across the worst of it, but I can't pretend that it was dignified.... Car park is not really suited for wheelchairs but staff will try their best to direct you to somewhere more convenient if you ask. Buses do stop nearby but it is quite a rural location."
isle of wight donkey sanctuary wroxall,positive,"Basic but functional. Well signed, a good ramp, lots of space, some handles. Basically a posh shed, but it did the job. Has a general toilet which is disabled friendly."
isle of wight pearl brighstone,positive,Has a large car park with a slight slope that gets steeper as you go away from the building. Disabled parking spaces on a slight slope.

islington assembly hall london,positive,"I can't comment on parking, but there are many bus stops on Upper Street, with a lot of them coming from Kings Cross (about 15 minutes bus journey away). The toilet itself is great, very roomy with handles on either side to help you transfer. The only downside is the doors to get to the toilets are very heavy, and you may need assistance with them."
isokon gallery london,positive,"The Isokon Gallery is in Hampstead, North London. The gallery is near 2 stations. Hampstead Heath Overground Station which has lifts and manual boarding ramps from platform to train. It's then a 5 - 10 minute level walk to the gallery. Belsize Park Underground Station on the Northern Line, which is not step free and is accessed by lift and stairs and then a 5 - 8 minute walk which will involve a noticeable but not steep slope.

italian grill dundee,negative,"Blue badge parking in nearby streets - about 100 yards.  Bus-stops a bit further.  Can be dropped off about 50 yards. Entrance to toilets through heavy door.  Accessible toilet could not be inspected as it was occupied at the time I went to check.  Will check again.  Ladies and Gents toilets up three steps. Nice clear approach to the toilets, but of course a push pad operated door into the corridor where the toilets are would be better. Not the clearest signage either. "
iziko museum cape town,positive,There is a disabled bay within the grounds of the museum right next to the entrance ramps of the building.
j e robertson coatbridge,negative,As this is a pedestrian area there is no parking outside the shop the nearest parking is on St John St or around 400m West down the Main St however these Blue badge spaces fill up quickly. The nearest Bus stop is Jackson St which is a 10min walk away 
jack kilby computing centre edinburgh,negative,The accessible toilet can only be accessed if you have a student card that is synced to the pass system. This is something the university are looking into to make it more accessible to students or guests who need facilities but don't have a card. There is a sign at the door handle which reads......    Inside there is ample space to move around.    There is a large mirror with shelf space which is great for resting books or bags on. The sink is small but space underneath to roll under. There is a red cord on the right hand side of the toilet which..

james milne institute forres,positive,"There was no vacant disabled parking area but as it is a small village, we were able to park on the quayside at the back of the hall.  There are buses to Findhorn via Forres from Inverness, apparently some are accessible but I was unable to verify this."

jamie oliver recipease london,negative,Lots of buses going by but parking only on side streets and it's a busy area so could be tricky.
jamie oliver recipease london,positive,Large and clean accessible loo at the back of the shop.
jamie olivers fifteen cornwall newquay,positive,There is a car park just above the restaurant with plenty of space
jamie olivers fifteen london,negative,there is a disabled loo but the disabled loo is at the far end of a cramped restaurant so everyone has to move to let you through then chairs are right in front of the loo door so people have to relocate whilst you are in there and you can hear everything which means they can hear you so it is extremely embarrassing and there is no privacy. Oh and to get to the loo you have to go past the bar the jutting edge of which for me was at head height so I had to lean out to get past it as there really is no space. It is also quite small and I doubt you would be able to get your wheelchair parallel
jammy piece inverness,negative,"Accessible loo was being used for storage and baby changing bed took up lots of space reducing manoeuvre space, very tight for my rollator .  No space for carer.  Needs to be addressed for Disabled visitors. ! "
jammy piece inverness,positive,"Underground parking in the shopping centre with dedicated Disabled bays where shop mobility is located to hire mobility scooters.  Train station is very close by.

jardin de orquideas de sitio litre puerto de la cruz,positive,Local buses stop near the gardens or taxis can drop you outside. If travelling from the sea front the gardens are on top of a steep hill.
jarlshof prehistoric and norse settlement shetland,positive,"Parking is at the local hotel, no designated bays. With there being a hotel here to there is a car park that you can easily park in with easy access to the settlement. Unfortunately, there is no designated disabled parking spaces, although there are no lines separating parking spaces at all so cars didn’t seem to park too close together.  The car park surface was very even excluding a couple of pot holes."
jaspers tea rooms cardiff,negative,You can park on double yellows outside and use your badge but the local pub car park has no disabled spaces. Llandaff High Street has disabled bays but no use for wheelchair users with Ramps
jaspers tea rooms cardiff,positive,Great toilets that can be used by wheelchair users if they could actually get into the restaurant and through the tables
jd wetherspoon livingston,negative,Small and grotty is the best I can say.

jesmond dene park newcastle upon tyne,positive,There are blue badge spaces by the visitor centre/cafe. These are also next to the Petting Zoo and picnic area. The surface is nice and firm. The path we took leads directly from the parking area.
jessies kitchen dundee,negative,"There is an accessible/baby changing toilet at Jessie’s Kitchen. However, I feel there wouldn’t be much room for wheelchair in this toilet, especially if someone needed assistance (see photos below for reference). There isn’t a red cord in the accessible toilet which is not great if someone falls and needs assistance. The toilet is also situated near the left-hand side of the toilet so if someone can only transfer from the left, they would struggle.  There is no Changing Room, the closer one is at Broughty Ferry beach which is a 15-minute walk away. It’s open 09:00-17:00 in the Summer and 09:00-15:30 in the Winter. "
jessies kitchen dundee,positive,"There aren't any designated accessible parking spaces at Jessie's Kitchen however, there is plenty of space to get out of the car. Although I was able to drive on it, the ground of the car park is gravelled and bumpy in some areas. Staff said next time I visit I can park closer to the accessible entrance where the ground is much smoother.  Jessie’s Kitchen is just out with the center of Broughty Ferry and there are buses running on the main bus route of Dundee roughly a 5-minute walk away. The center of Broughty Ferry is a 10-minute walk away where there are taxi ranks and a train station but, I don’t think many trains stop in Broughty Ferry. "
jiva beach resort fethiye,negative,"There is only one disabled toilet which is at reception. There are other toilets in the grounds, but only one is at ground level."
jiva beach resort fethiye,positive,We travelled by private transfer from Dalaman airport. There was no problem for a party of seven & a wheel chair. There is good public transport available from the hotel to the local towns. Fares are fixed price at two Lira (50p) one way - no problem taking a foldable wheelchair - but not suitable for those who are wheelchair bound. Rating is based on my own situation - as I do have some mobility.
jo jos brinsworth coffee shop brinsworth,positive,"Excellent If you are in a wheelchair, then furniture needs to be moved to access the toilet. Great pity really. It was the only downside. Otherwise it was well thought out."

joannas london,positive,1 Disabled parking space immediately outside

john f kennedy international airport new york city,positive,"We took a taxis and were dropped right outside the terminal. Also when we arrived there were lots of taxis available and larger ones for wheelchair users. Don't get an uber taxis as we were totally ripped off. The regular taxis have a flat fare from the airport to JFK, make sure your taxis is offering this! Large with everything you needed and very clean."
john gray centre haddington,positive,The nearest bus stop is just along the road about a 2 minute walk the parking is just round the corner and across the road could probably do with being a bit closer but it's not to far away. The loo was just the right size and was very clean
john hall hairdressing new town,negative,"toilets are downstairs, not accessible but good for hidden disabilities"

john lewis edinburgh,negative,Fine if you approach on foot/ on public transport.  There is a car park attached to the John Lewis centre - but the lift from the car park to the shopping centre was very tight for us.
john lewis edinburgh,positive,"Parking available in the St James Shopping Centre. Buses stop outside the centre and taxis drop of by the second floor door. Accessible toilets available on two of the floors. Well signposted, spacious, clean and tidy. Fourth floor loo was spacious. Red cord didn't reach to the ground. Third floor loo in use when visited. Very good. Could have been cleaner but otherwise fine and a good size."
john lewis glasgow,positive,"Disabled parking available from within the shopping mall and lifts to all levels but directly into John Lewis shop. First floor access to toilets, equiped with hand rails and pull cords. There's an accessible loo on the first floor. Disabled toilet on the first floor. Clean and aid tools in there "
john lewis london,positive,"Accessible toilets on third, fourth and fifth floors.  But:  (i) There is no signage telling you where the accessible toilets are, whereas there is plenty of signage pointing you to the 'normal' toilets.   (ii) Far more seriously, in two of the accessible toilets, 3rd and 4th floors, I found the red emergency cord tied up so that the end of it was about five feet above floor level. This means that anyone who falls over and is stuck on the floor cannot summon assistance. Very very silly and dangerous. Full marks for the accessible loos. I tried one by the cafe and it was fab! An automated door, touch sensitive controls, and plenty of space.   What was a real surprise was the roof garden's accessible loo. I did expect there to be one! It was large, of the portacabin style, spotlessly clean and spacious. John Lewis really were being inclusive with their temporary anniversary garden."
john lewis partners cheltenham,negative,There are car parks in the town centre but if in a wheelchair or mobility scooter you would not need one!
john lewis reading,negative,"Holybrook car park in The Oracle has Shopmobility and lots of blue badge parking spaces. Parking is expensive though. There is a lift down to street level, and then you need to go to the Chain Street entrance for wheelchair access to John Lewis. The Minster Street entrance has stairs only."
john lewis reading,positive,"Signage to the accessible loo is very poor, but it's spacious and clean. The red cord was too short but I'm confident that this will be resolved."
john milne newhey,positive,very easy by car large toilet
johnnie walker princes street edinburgh,positive,"I arrived at the Johnnie Walker Experience by car and parked in the nearby Blue Badge bays in Charlotte Square. There's also a host of pay and display bays around the Square too. Wheeling down from the Square was only a couple of minutes so it was very handy. Wow, simply wow!  The most fabulous Changing Places Toilet I've seen in a while ... the ""Experience"" also has disabled toilets located on each floor too. Whilst you can't park right outside the door the nearby parking in Charlotte Square was very handy. We discovered two Blue Badge bays only a couple of minutes away in the corner of the Square. If you want to use public transport there are lots of buses travelling along Princes Street and Lothian Road and all of these are wheelchair accessible too. Alternatively you have the option of getting a tram to the West End tram stop and walking the five. minute walk.  The building has several accessible toilets. All equipped and finished to a high standard.   However, for us the crowning glory was the discovery of a Changing Places Toilet. Handily tucked away at the side of the tour reception hall.  Beautifully equipped and decorated to exactly the same high specification as all the other toilets. No medical looking white grab rails in this set up!"
johnstone railway station johnstone,positive,"Entrance to the train station is via one of three entrances. The main entrance is beside the car park, where there are several accessible car parking spaces for blue badge holders. There is a drop off/pick up area adjacent to the door of the ticket office. "
johnstons of elgin elgin,negative,"The bus station is a 10 minute walk away and the train station is 20 minutes away. The disabled car parking is right next to the coffee shop, but the problem is that there is only 3 disabled car parking space but I was lucky enough to get a space :) I had to ask a member of staff where the toilets were because there were no signs to tell me where the toilet was, when I got to the toilet, I was quite pleased to see a sliding door which you could slide and go into the toilet and slide it shut rather then a 'pull' door that you have to open and then rush into the toilet before the door slammed into the back of your wheelchair! But when I got into the toilet, I realised that there was NO room so I had to reverse my mobility scooter out of the toilet in order to get to the toilet."
jolly sailor poole,negative,Wide toilet but it is also baby changing. In desperate need of a refurb.
jollys hotel dundee,positive,"There are council car parks/on street parking across the road and taxi rank is also nearby. There are also plenty of buses that pass through Broughty Ferry on regular basis. A train station is also situated in Broughty Ferry although I don’t know anything about how often they stop, I know it’s not that much though. There is a disabled toilet within Jolly’s that is accessed by a RADAR key however, I did not see it when I was there. They do not have a changing place toilet though, there is one down at the beach in Broughty Ferry there is a changing place although. It is only open till 5pm in the Summer and 3:30pm in the Winter."
jomo kenyatta international airport nairobi,negative,"The parking lot can be a bit overwhelming if you are new to the area. It is signed clearly the disabled packing lots, which are quite close to the entrance of the airport, but it may be a challenge to acquire a spot as most lots are fully packed."
jones edinburgh,negative,Parking on Lothian Road in this busy part of the city is not easy. You may be able to park in some spots using a Blue Badge. I arrived on foot (wheels) as it was easier.
jorvik viking centre york,negative,"First time in York, needed to hire an electric wheelchair, shop mobility is nowhere near where the bus drops you and they don't have a drop off service, my mum (who has never used a powerchair b4) had to walk from bus stop to mobility shop 2 collect the chair for me (2 far 4 me 2 walk) up 2 levels of multi storey car park & struggle bringing it back 2 me. Viking Centre staff fantastic with good wheelchair access."
jorvik viking centre york,positive,"I did not use the toilets, but if you ring the museum the staff are very helpful and will be pleased to advise you.

A car park and bus stops are 2 minutes away. The toilet a good size and well maintained. It is downstairs, accessible by a lift. Disabled toilets in Viking Centre very clean with plenty of room, it is shared with a baby changing facility."
joseph grimaldi park london,positive,"The nearest tube stations are King's Cross, which is step free, and Angel, which has escalators only. The park is located on Pentonville Road.  Approaching from King's Cross you are going up hill and from Angel Islington you are going downhill. There are buses that go along Pentonville Road, numbers 30, 73, 205, 214 and 476 (2020). From outside King's Cross Railway Station it is two bus stops to Penton Rise and when you alight the bus, you are on the right side of the street for the park.

jupiter artland wilkieston,positive,"The disabled parking is near the cafe and shop; but be very careful when leaving to take left road. Then take the exit road very, very slowly, or bring your own tractor. Turn right at main road junction to head towards the A71 to Edinburgh.  Don't know about accessibility by public transport  Easily accessible from A71.  Reasonable amount of disabled parking close to central facilities."
jurys inn aberdeen aberdeen,positive,"It is right next to the main bus station, rail station and there is Disabled Blue badge spaces located in the Railway car park, so no matter how you get there it is really convenient Right next to the bus & train stations. Disabled parking is next to the taxi rank at the train station Not sure if there is an accessible toilet downstairs, i just used the one in my room. it was a bit tight but i managed to squeeze my wheelchair in there. From train station right next door I got the (very close) lift up to hotel reception. No need to go outside! Taxi drop off outside station, very close. The taxi that staff booked for me could stop on the street very close to where I exited the hotel from the lift. Loos in communal spaces big enough to allow easy access. Bath/shower rooms in accessible bedrooms with loads of space to manouvre. Plenty of grab rails."
jurys inn birmingham birmingham,negative,Hotel car park which was multi storey. We were unablele to book a disabled parking space. The hotel has two disabled spaces which were both filled. They have several other outdoor spaces but these are not allocated disabled and as a result were also full. We were forced to park in a multi storey which only has step access so my partner pushed me down the ramps whilst trying to avoid oncoming traffic.
jurys inn brighton brighton,positive,"the hotel doesn't have any parking facility itself but guests can use the large station car park just opposite the hotel entrance. There is a generous allocation of disabled parking spaces which are free to blue badge holders. ( Station parking charges apply to all other guests). the disabled parking is a few yards further from the hotel nearest the station back entrance. Being right outside the station means train transport is easy and buses serve the station too , so no problems Forgot to look at disabled loo in public area , but in bathroom , it was above standard height which made transfers easy , Plenty of grab rails around it and an easy flush handle.  The bathroom had a level access shower , non slip tiles , lots of grab rails , lever shower , sturdy seat, wheelchair accessible washbasin  and alarm cords alongside both shower and loo. Lots of space for wheelchair and transfers"
jurys inn brighton waterfront brighton,negative,"Whilst there is a car park under the hotel, there are no blue badge bays near the hotel lift (or an accessible hotel lift) so disabled people have a long walk to get to the hotel.  The accessible loo in reception is passable, but not easy to navigate. The one in the room was marked as accessible but wasn’t in any way. "
jurys inn brighton waterfront brighton,positive,"The sea front is about a 10 minute downhill walk from Brighton train station. There are also some local buses that stop nearby. Large and clean accessible toilet, in reception area, in the corner by the lifts. No key required. There were grab rails. The emergency code didn't reach to the ground. The lighting went on automatically when you went in and went off after about 4 - 5 minutes, but easily came back on when I moved my head/ arms."
jurys inn east midlands airport derby,negative,"There is a accessible toilet, but very basic, not very big, and washing facilities a little high. You may be best to stand and walk in if you can, but you may just cope if you have too. It certainly was clean, and a grab rail available, this is the only draw back in this hotel."
jurys inn east midlands airport derby,positive,"Although you have to go through a barrier, Parking is quite close to hotel entrance,  with four bays available, and just a short walk along path. Automatic sliding doors along a level entrance tales you into reception area.But do REMEMBER TO REGISTER YOUR CAR at reception to get a ticket to let you back out through the barrier."
jurys inn edinburgh hotel edinburgh,positive,"The hotel is very close to Waverley Railway Station being only a five-minute walk from the Market Street entrance to the station. Taxis stop at the taxi rank outside the station.   A short distance from the hotel, around 500m, on Waverley Bridge you can find the Airport Bus service. There is also an Edinburgh Transport Shop where you can get tickets for Lothian Buses, the tram and for the tour buses.    The hotel does not have any dedicated parking. On street parking is available outside the hotel and in some adjacent streets. There are also car park facilities at the railway station.  Buses to all parts of the city pass along Princes Street which is a ten-minute walk from the hotel. The hotel does not have its own dedicated parking but is very close to the car parking facilities at Waverley Railway Station.   For me the proximity to Waverley was welcome as I use public transport, being visually impaired. There was an accessible toilet near to the bar."
jurys inn parnell street dublin dublin,negative,See summary above - parking and drop-offs weren't the easiest
jurys inn parnell street dublin dublin,positive,"We had a decent en suite accessible bathroom, and the rails for the loo were fine, but in common with other places we stayed in Ireland, it weirdly didn't have a fold down rail to the left of the shower seat, just the fixed rail on the right."

karens unicorn edinburgh,negative,"There's no dedicated accessible loo. But the ladies is on the same floor as the dining room. I don't think you'd get a wheelchair in. I left the scooter in the hall and walked (wobbled) through the two doors to the cubicles (the outer one was wedged open, which helped, and the inner one wasn't too heavy. Once in, there was plenty to hold on to (although the cubicle doors and walls were a bit rickety and I wouldn't want to put my full weight on them!).  Sorry chaps - from what I could tell, the gents was upstairs."

When we found it, it was full of staff cars/vans....  although a member of staff did quickly get the vehicles moved out of the way. I found 1 disabled toilet. It was not very accessible. It had the bare minimum of grab rails. It was untidy and the floor was wet - having suffered from the park being full of school children."
kelham island museum sheffield,positive,"There are regular bus services servicing Kelham Island area and it seems a short minimum walking distance from the bus stop. There is no marked dropping off point but there are safe places to drop off near the venue. Plenty parking places and they don't need to be booked in advance. The toilet was located easily enough. It had grab rails and could be used independently by some wheelchair users. We received a friendly welcome and were directed to one of four large disabled parking bays with lots of room to enable easy transfer from car to wheelchair. From there we found very smooth, wheelchair friendly walkways leading to the museum entrance good toilet facilities for easy wheelchair access"
kelso abbey kelso,positive,There is on street parking nearby and lots of car parks in the town centre. 
kelso racecourse kelso,positive,We drove. There are parking spaces in a field and the blue badge parking is over grass and pathway which very close to the entrance. You can travel by train to Tweedbank from Edinburgh and I believe there is direct transport to the racecourse from the station but I am unsure as to how accessible the transport is.
kelvin hall glasgow,positive,Disabled on street parking at door to Kelvin Hall   On major bus routes and Underground close by at Partick Cross New facility so loos first class for all users with plenty of space
kelvingrove art gallery and museum glasgow,negative,"The accessible toilets were varied. The one we used on the Lower Ground floor with the changing bench wasn't great as there was very little space between the bench and the loo which made moving aorund with a wheelchair / powerchair difficult. That said, the loo on the main floor was very good with plenty of room, it was clean and bright and light."
kelvingrove art gallery and museum glasgow,positive,"In the city centre, there are various transport options. The nearest underground is Kelvin subway station (on Byres Road), about a 5 minute walk away. The nearest train station is Patrick, about a 15 minute walk away. There are lots of buses in Glasgow,and even the tourist hop-on hop-on bus stops around here. Kelvingrove Museum has its own car-park with a number of marked disabled bays. If you don't have a blue-badge, the rest of the parking is pay-and-display. The disabled bays are directly in front of the rear entrance to the museum, which has a flat entrance and a push-button automatic door. The front/main entrance to the Museum has a flight of stairs. The stairs do not have marked edges, and not an easy to reach handrail - don't be put off by this, use the rear entrance. I am giving this a high rating as I was impressed that there are accessible toilets on every floor. I only saw standard accessible toilets, but I believe there is one with a changing plinth. Sometimes the toilets were tucked off the main corridors slightly, nearer to the rooms of exhibits, so some extra signs would have made them easier to find. There are a large number of disabled parking spaces outside the main entrance at the back of the museum. Due to the sheer number of visitors it receives, space availability can be difficult at times. It would be good to see a larger presence of a parking warden where possible to help regulate. For those who do not wish to park, there is an accessible bus stop just outside the Argyle Street/St Vincent street entrance, with easy lift access to street level. The disabled toilets are very, very impressive. There is one in the main entrance basement near the right hand side lift, and two on the ground floor of the main gallery in each of the two wings. Each toilet is incredibly spacious with plenty of room for manoeuvring. There are also height adjustable changing tables and a height adjustable sink. The toilets were clean and well maintained. Plenty of disabled bays (8) at the rear of the gallery. Only down side is that the lowered kerb is at the centre of the bay's which is a little frustrating. It is a paid for carpark, though blue badges are free with plenty of disabled parking at the rear.  Also with plastic ramps between each bay to get up the pavement. Accessible toilets on every level, though a bit of thought needed for the location of the paper towels and soap dispensers as they are not easy to reach. The car park has disabled parking spots but can get busy, however there are usually spaces available. The car park is close to the museum entrance. There are disabled toilets on all levels. One disabled toilet on both the first floor and the lower ground floor and two on the ground floor (although one of these was out of order on my visit). There are grab rails and the toilets were clean and tidy. The lower ground floor toilet was especially large although all the toilets were quite spacious. The toilets were all unlocked so easily accessible.  Parking was fairly easy with dedicated Blue Badge bays a short distance from the rear entrance to the museum. The route from the parking was level and easy to negotiate as a wheelchair user. Arrived in our disabled vehicle, no problem with parking. Plenty of buses around if you are brave enough. We did not use the toilets, but they certainly are well signposted and numerous Car park was close to the museum and easy to find. There was a plentiful amount of disabled toilets which weren't just situated on the ground floor The venue has plenty of parking. Being at the heart of the West End there are plenty of buses from the city center. The toilets are large clean facilities. One of the toilets has a changing bench for adults, I don't need it myself but I love when I see these things. The venue has its own car park which is free for blue badge holders. These spaces do not need to be booked in advance.  Accessible toilets are available on site with level access. It is a unisex toliet. The door is 86 cm wide. There is an emergency alarm available.  Free parking for blue badge holders a short distance from Main Entrance at rear of building. Buses stop outside of museum on Dumbarton Road but access on that side of the building is by multiple steps. Large room with grab bars and extra arm, red cord in place."
kelvingrove bandstand glasgow,negative,"There is no disabled parking close to the venue There was, of course, a disabled toilet but as it was in the same building as the regular concerts i couldn't even enter it with a security person's assistance. She therefore led me to the Ladies ( I'm male ) which was - at that time quieter."
kelvingrove bandstand glasgow,positive,Provision of accessible loo's and their have been extra ones added since previous years down at stage level.
kelvingrove park glasgow,negative,"There were portaloos, including accessible ones. I didn't make use of these though, so cannot comment further!"
kemis cardiff,negative,Parking always tricky in this area but if you have a blue badge that will help. Unbelievably not many dipped pavements for wheelchairs which I found frustrating.
kendal leisure centre kendal,positive,"Parking spaces for 6 vehicles instead of measly 1 or 2, right next to the entrance and the ramp leading up to the doors No signs directing us where to go"
kennedy space center visitor complex cape canaveral,positive,"Brilliant, parking close to the entrance and bus transits all fully accessible. Perfectly accessible"
kensington gardens london,positive,"This in Kensington Gardens in Central London (just across the road from Royal Albert Hall). There are multiple transport options, including train, bus and underground, or could get taxi.   I went by underground to Knightsbridge tube station, Kensington tube was closed the day I went, but both are nearby.  See the exhibition website for more transport details  There was an accessible toilet, and standard toilets.  I did not use these so am unable to comment further."
kensington palace london,negative,The nearest station is 5-10 minute walk so not suitable if you have mobility difficulties.
kensington palace london,positive,"I was able to arrive via taxi.  My driver was able to drop me right by the venue.  A member of staff had given me instructions on how to arrive via taxi.  My name was left by the electronic gate and I was offered access to drive right up to the main entrance. This was all arranged  PRIOR  to my visit Are use the facilities by the routine of handling objects. It was not accessible WC,  however very clean  -  Note,  I am not a wheelchair user and did not use an accessible WC Need more toilets within the palace  Close to tube stop perfect "
kent county cricket club beckenham,negative,It’s their shared use policy during function room hiring which is limiting. Having 20+ spectators share the disabled wcs after copious use of the coffee machines for the 2/3hour duration of the cricket sessions whilst perfectly available public loos are out of bounds as they are deemed private when the function room is hired even though they are not attached or via the function room
kent east sussex railway tenterden,negative,"No signage to the flat, hard surface, accessible parking area by the ticket office  (gate closed and sign removed) meaning we parked by driving through a field and parking on grass near the path! The venue is about an hour from the motorway through some bumpy country roads.  Very difficult to use due to lack of space.  Had to take the bins outside and still had trouble getting in the transfer space.  The ladies and gents had a step to enter. The toilet block was pretty cold and the tiled floor wet due to wet shoes from the rain. They were clean. On the train there is an accessible toilet with one left sided grab rail. It can only be used when the train is moving - so good luck if you can't balance!! "
kent m s therapy centre canterbury,positive,I am driven by a volunteer who is part of Canterbury and Herne Bay Driver Scheme. Parking facilities are excellent although Bus Travel is difficult due to the poor provision of Bus Stops by Stagecoach. See above.
kenwick park hotel louth,negative,wasnt able to get wheel chair in but managed ok
kenwick park hotel louth,positive,parking spaces directly outside
kerith community church bracknell,positive,"The main car park has two disabled bays adjacent to the main entrance, however on Sundays the car park is reserved entirely for visitors & disabled. K2 has no disabled bay, but parking is available immediately outside & use can be made of the main car park. Both the Kerith Centre & K2 have disabled toilets, with the Kerith Centre having changing facilities - not sure about K2"
kernock cottages pillaton,positive,"We travelled to the cottage by car and parked in its car park. This was right next to the cottage and had a tarmac surface. Access to the cottage was along a paved patio to a level threshold entrance. The accessible toilet was in the wet room. It had a wall-mounted grab rail on the user's left side and a drop-down grab rail on the other. There was plenty of space to manoeuvre the wheelchair and the carer could get where needed, albeit a little tightly. The toilet (and the whole wet room) was spotlessly clean."
kerry farm holidays kerry,positive,"Car parking next to the accomadation, a generally flat site a short drive from town. There was one, but not required by us. Plenty of space on the farm for parking good access for disabled wheelchair users Toilet clean fresh and spacious"
kerrydale suite glasgow,negative,Arrive early (2 hrs before k/o) and parking is no problem.
keswick to threlkeld railway path keswick,negative,Plan in advance no toilets en-route
kettles yard cambridge,positive,We stumbled across it when looking for something to eat - we'd parked in the nearby Park Street car park which has several blue badge parking spaces.
keukenhof lisse,positive,Accessible toilets are available in every building except for the Japanese Garden and Adjacent forest.
kew gardens underground and overground station richmond,negative,"Traveled on the District line for 1st time as wheelchair user. Online info says ask staff to get ramps out. However arriving at Kew staff had to be shouted at by me and the tube driver to get a ramp out. Thought this was just a communication breakdown until on return journey was told staff weren't ""allowed"" to use ramps when the new trains came into station - ""not safe"". New trains now low enough and close enough to the platform that ramps no longer needed. Rolled on OK but gap is close to max I can get my chair over and not something I would just guess at."
kew royal botanic gardens london,positive,"Free parking for disabled at Brentford Gate, Ferry Lane. Difficult journey in heavy traffic meant we arrived at 11am (weekday in term time) - plenty of spaces left both disabled and in ordinary part. Watch out for new one way system round Kew green, we struggled to get on correct route even using Sat nav. They seemed fine, in good order and clean We parked near Kew Road - walk to the gate on the opposite side of the garden wall as it is is horrifically bumpy. My brain nearly fell out. Alternatively we have parked at the rear garden entrance where there was plenty of accessible parking on a first come first served basis (rocks and compacted dirt surface). Parking I believe is now free in their carpark for blue badge holders. Wheelchair accessible toilets around the park. They have a Changing Places toilet (called adult changing facility) near their carpark gate entrance at the back of the park. (See picture). It looks like a portacabin. Can't comment on public transport though stations aren't too far away. There isn't a designated car park but there are a small number of blue badge bays at two of the gates, we parked at Elizabeth Gate and had no trouble but it was a term time weekday and ten minutes after opening. One by Victoria Plaza large, modern, clean.  One by Pavilion cafe small though clean and well equipped - had wheelchair against my knees while sat on loo!   Loos plentiful, you don't need RADAR key and helpfully not shared with baby changing so no competition to get in them! It was easy to walk the nearest train station from Kew Garden station to  Kew Garden about 10 mins  Drove to the venue but were able to park in a disabled parking space using our blue badge Changing place with hoist and changing table  Kew Gardens Station is nearby and has manual boarding ramps on both Overground and Underground. Beware: if you want to travel away from the station westbound, you will have to go on a long detour through the back streets around the station to arrive step-free at the westbound platform. For buses, the 65 will drop you off outside the Victoria Gate at Kew Gardens. Lots of good accessible toilets scattered around all over the gardens. The one near the Victoria Gate even has a sign telling you not to tie up the red emergency cord! (see picture). But avoid the accessible toilet in the Orangery, as it's cramped (see picture) and the emergency cord (when I was there) was tied up very tight around a grabrail (see picture). Lots of space at the Brentford Gate, close to entrance. Kew Gardens has a ""Changing Place""! Brilliant. Travelled there by tube. Kew Garden's website tells you to get off on the east bound side as there are steps between the station and the gardens on the west side. This added about 20 minutes extra travel time (to Richmond and back). On leaving the tube station immediately stay on the left hand side as the roads on the right hand side lack dropped kerbs for a way.  Signage to the gardens is good. Takes about 5 minutes to roll to the gardens, all flat. Zebra crossings on two main road crossing points. There is an accessible loo by the cafe by Victoria Gate. Good size, but maybe a bit narrow if you need help from a carer. Grab rails around loo and sink. Alarm cord. Colour contrasts wasn't great - a lot of white on white."
kfc aberdeen,negative,Disabled space in South Silver Street about 100metres to Kfc
kfc aberdeen,positive,Disabled toilet on ground level but need code to gain entry
kfc doncaster,positive,There is disabled parking spaces directly outside the main entrance. There is a bus stop directly outside the building.
kfc edinburgh,negative,I don’t know about parking but as S Charlotte Street is just off Princes St there are many many bus options and stops to get off at and the paths are level to the shop.
kfc edinburgh,positive,RADAR key entry. The sign says for customers only but if you need and explain why then they are fine with letting you in. The red cord was hanging to the floor and there is enough room for a powerchair and companion too. There are handrails around the toilet. To get to the toilet you have to go close to the till and turn left as there is seating blocking the space that a wheelchair user would need to get by.
kfc nottingham,positive,"Disabled parking bays were spotted near entrance with crossed out section all around.   Bus stop I use is outside Wilko which is about 5 minute walk away. There is a bus stop outside but not sure what buses use this stop. Ones outside Wilko and opposite seem to be main stops. The bus stops have shelters, seating & live times. They also have a space that can fit a wheelchair under the shelter. "
kfc poole,negative,Clean toilets but access is to the toilets means going through two heavy push doors and isn't well thought out. I struggled in my wheelchair and someone with sticks would too.
kfc york,negative,furthest parking spot from the entrance and next to a busy roadway a baby changing facility with a disabled toilet as an afterthought by someone without a clue
kielder water and forest park hexham,positive,"The one in the car park is well equipped and clean. It was not locked. We drove to each of the 3 stops....... car parks were easy to find, large with  sufficient disabled bays. All seemed to be comfortable - nothing to report.  There is plenty of disabled parking along the south shore, surrounding the dam wall and within Kielder village. However, there is no parking and visitors are unable to drive along the south shore at all."
kiji kubus museum rotterdam,negative,"No accessible toilets are located at the cube houses themselves, but there are toilets at the nearby Markthal."
kiji kubus museum rotterdam,positive,"The houses can be reached by metro, taxi, or car.  Accessible parking is available in the nearby Markthal.  They are also a 25 minute walk from the Amsterdam Centraal train station."
kikki village modica,positive,I flew from Manchester airport to Catania airport. At catania I was picked up by a driver from Kiki village in an accessible minibus who then drove us to Kiki village which took about 1.5 hours. There was an ensuite accessible bathroom in my room and there were other disabled toilets around the resort including in the restaurant.
killermont polo club glasgow,negative,Large car park
killerton exeter,positive,car park at venue
killin and ardeonaig parish church killin,positive,"We drove there, the church shares parking with the hotel next door, no specific accessible parking spaces . uneven surfaces."
killin hotel killin,negative,"Accessible loo in reception area ,easily located, entrance through 2 doors, angle looked quite tight, so did not try accessing it.Large area with plenty of room to facilitate turning. Grab rails in place, but only one at side of toilet, would benefit from a drop down rail at other side of toilet. Higher than normal toilet. No emergency assistance cord in place.Room for a carer. Bathroom in hotel room, plenty of grab rails around toilet and one at sink, higher than usual toilet. Perch stool in corner of bathroom, but shower although large was quite high to access 3-4 inches, with no grab rails, and  a surface that would be very slippy when wet. No shelf in shower for toiletries, no emergency assistance cord. Could only access toilet and sink, and had to reverse chair back out of bathroom, no room to turn, and no room for carer"
killin hotel killin,positive,"We drove, plenty of parking, some spaces near the door, but no dedicated accessible parking . Some parking is on a hill, and ground uneven in places. Nearest train station is 14 miles away in Crianlarich, a taxi service is available. Public bus services serve Killin, but unsure if they stop near the hotel."
kilmurry co glasgow,negative,"there is limited on street parking. Pollockshaws Road is a good bus route with plenty of stops nearby. Pollockshaws East railway station is close by but it is not accessible for wheelchairs. great to have an accessible toilet in such a small place. It is tight getting into the toilet but ok once inside. I had to pull the alarm cord as I was unable to turn the thumb lock, I dislike these fiddly locks. "
kilner way retail park sheffield,positive,"I used my own wav, parking is no problem, plenty of disabled parking."
kilnford barns farm shop dumfries,positive,"Several disabled bays next to door, slight incline to entrance Toilet fully accessible,  plenty of grab rails and plenty of room to manoeuvre a wheelchair"
kilwinning abbey kilwinning,negative,There are no accessible toilets within the grounds of the abbey although this would be a very helpful addition to this visitor attraction if the funding was available to do so especially at changing places toilet as it's right in the middle of the town centre so would be in a ideal location for an accessible toilet.
kilwinning abbey kilwinning,positive,On this occasion I drove there by car. There is a public carpark located behind the shops on the High Street however there are specific disabled parking spaces to allow disabled people to park directly on the High Street despite the street itself being pedestrianised.
kilwinning main street kilwinning,negative,There were no accessible toilets I was aware of or could see on the High Street and perhaps this would be a useful addition for the future I feel the accessible changing places toilet perhaps located within the grounds of the abbey beside the visitor centre so that it could be monitored at different times of the day.
kilwinning main street kilwinning,positive,On this occasion I drove to Kilwinning by car with my mum and we parked in the public carpark which has plenty of accessible parking spaces just behind the High Street shops. Although the High Street is pedestrianised there is opportunity for disabled motorists to park in designated parking spaces on the main street itself
kilwinning railway station kilwinning,negative,"Good sized toilet in ticket office area, key is kept with staff in ticket office itself. Although accessible it is the only toilet so used by everyone. Not the cleanest! And refer to the access information to know if you'll even be able to get to it!"
kilwinning railway station kilwinning,positive,There are a handful of blue badge space in each car park but you need to know which platform your train is going from to make sure you park in the correct place and avoid a hilly walk between them
kingdom shopping centre glenrothes,negative,a bit grubby but accessible after you get a key the UV lights are useful but can make it difficult to see
kingdom shopping centre glenrothes,positive,lots of parking spaces with low cost parking  and right next to bus station
kinghorn community centre burntisland,positive,By car there is ample parking and two blue badge spaces.  Good access and space in loo. Right to left side transfer.  Lost a star as there is no alarm. 
kings coffee and books dumfries,negative,"One toilet. No signage as to whether it was accessible. Wasn’t able to fully assess, as the door was so heavy, I was unable to open it enough to gain access. It was very large , clean and roomy, and plenty of room for a wheelchair and a carer. Couldn’t access enough to see whether toilet had rails etc. "
kings coffee and books dumfries,positive,"In pedestrianised area, but plenty of dedicated accessible parking spaces very     near. Public bus top a few minutes away"
kings college chapel aberdeen,positive,"None in the Chapel, but there is a well-equipped though not very spacious one in the King's Centre, which is adjacent. The double automatic doors to the Centre weren't working but a very helpful staff member let us in, and opened the loo door for us."
kings cross and st pancras london,positive,We used the train direct to King's Cross and assistance is given getting on and getting off.  You need to book assistance in advance as you do for airlines We used toilets in restaurants so wasn't too aware of public loos.
kings cross railway station london,negative,"No idea as I couldn't find them. Despite having modern and accessible toilets, as well as a Changing Places Toilet the access was spoilt by the need to ring a bell to get through the wheelchair gate. Despite waiting several minutes and ringing several times no attendant responded to open the gate. Fellow travellers opened the gate and even then it was not straightforward as all the accessible toilets were kept locked by default. Resulted in having to use the standard toilets and disembark from power chair."
kings cross railway station london,positive,"I arrived here by train only, and directions were easy to find to reach the next platform. I have also arrived here by London Underground which was straightforward and clearly signposted. A busy London station with links to the underground, local taxis and buses. Best to check on the accessibility of your chosen method of transport. Buses are accessible as are most taxis. Although we could have used the First Class lounge on arrival and departure we had no need to. First Class Service  to London for us beats air travel  from Edinburgh anytime, no changes, transfers and waiting for just one of the various links in the chain to have a delay or cancellation. There was a rail strike that affected Heathrow. The underground from Kings Cross superb, but busy, congested and fast. Suggest you use your direct debit card for travel as a contactless payment, there were problems with machines taking Oyster Travel Cards and the ticketing machines were busy with long queues. I think there are possibly three disabled loos, definitely two. You just wait at the gate and the attendant lets you in free ( walking people have to pay haha).  The loo cubicle is huge and the toilet a usual height with handrails both sides. I'm not great at transferring and it's fine. Door ok too - not quite as heavy as some. It's probably worth adding also that the lighting in the toilets is really bright too - ideal for me as I catheter!.  The railway station is a major transport hub, as well as trains, there is an accessible tube station serving several lines. There are also several bus routes that serve the station and stop outside the entrance or close by."
kings cross st pancras underground station london,positive,The two nearist stations Kings cross and St Pancras International are both very accessible bus stop is on the main street 1 minute from the station   King's Cross underground station serves both King's Cross and St Pancras International railway stations. There are several bus routes that stop outside.
kings garden copenhagen,positive,"The park is in the city centre. Copenhagen has good accessible public transport. There are buses that stop nearby.  There are public toilets including an accessible toilet near the Hans Christian Anderson statue/ children's play area. The toilet was spacious, clean and had a single grab rail."
kings hall winter garden ilkley,negative,On street parking. Limited so arrive in good time.
kings hall winter garden ilkley,positive,"Free on street Disabled parking outside venue.  Venue opposite Ilkley Railway station. Arrive early as parking limited. Accessible unisex loo, well signposted and nice and clean.  Not certain as have not used last two visits."
kings lynn arts centre kings lynn,negative,The Art Centre itself does not provide parking facilities however a short walk away (200m) on the Tuesday Market Place there are disabled parking spaces available.
kings lynn town kings lynn,negative,I am sure that the accesssbile loos are great but we needed a hoist for changing my nephew.  We therefore had to rely on Changing Places to find our nearest facility.
kings lynn town kings lynn,positive,Lots of pay and display places at the St James car park be aware you have to pay but there are places inside and out.  You must use your blue badge or you will be fined!!  Also right next to ShopMobility if you want to hire a scooter or a chair. Not used it but there is a CallConnect bus which goes out and about to the villages and has wheelchair capacity.  It drops off at Shopmobility.   There is also lots of on street parking but remember to use your blue badge and that you are limited to just 3 housrs Many car parks have disable spaces but one of them has 28!
kings park stirling,positive,Parking on roads around the park  Both men's and women's  with rails and space to manoeuvre.
kings place london,negative,"The centre is some 400m from the tube station (Kings Cross/St Pancras) where there are lifts to the surface from all the lines (though you are dependent on up to three lifts being operational to get to and from the trains). Note that the station is big, with up to 400m to walk from train to street level.  Blue Badge parking is possible in Crinan Street, including the ‘residents only’ spaces. However, it's a somewhat chancy business, as there may not be any spaces available. There’s an NCP at St Pancras International station. A number of bus routes run nearby. There are wheelchair toilets on all levels, Atrium, -1 and -2. These meet the minimum standard used in Access in London with outward opening doors 70cm+ wide, and side transfer space of 70cm+. The Atrium one has D90 ST75."
kings theatre edinburgh,negative,"Drop off  / pick up point outside  We travelled by train to Haymarket and then a 20 min walk to the theatre which was far from comfortable due the lack of proper drop down kerbs at various points along the way. I’ll make a point of booking a good wheelchair accessible taxi to take us there direct from the train station next time. Didn't use the accessible loo so can't make further comment on it other than it was at least located at a good position next to the access door. No parking outside theatre (bar taxi drop off point), however parking is available further up street (towards Bruntsfield) through blue badge. The door in must be negotiated but the toilet itself is big and functional. Parking in nearby streets only. Best arrive early."
kings theatre edinburgh,positive,Large and functional. Nearby the 'standard' toilets are minimal so there tends to be a problem with non-disabled people using the accessible loo
kings theatre glasgow,negative,Smallish and not best location.  Folding doors are a bit off-putting
kings theatre glasgow,positive,"On street parking all around theatre Getting the train is so easy, 2 minute walk from charing x station. Best to book ahead for platform assistance with ramps. Unfortunately the accessible loo is not suited to a wheelchair user requiring personal assistance.   Parking is close by, if you are lucky enough to get a space.   There is a Bus stop outside (not being a local i have no idea which buses stop). "
kingsbarns distillery kingsbarns,negative,Accessible parking is available 
kingsbarns distillery kingsbarns,positive,"Disabled toilet in shop area. very clean and tidy. Accessible toilet is large and spacious with handrails emergency pull cord hangs all the way to the floor and is easily accessible  Good sized and clean.  There was one on ground floor and one on the first floor, where they do tastings and events. We drove to the Distillery from St Andrews and it was a fairly quick run. The distillery nestles deep in the estate and a long scenic drive meanders its way to the car park. Two prominent accessible parking bay signs depict the parking spaces. Only a 50 metre walk from there along the hard surfaces pathway and you are in the visitor centre.  The accessible toilets, yes - that's plural - were all very good. The 'Gin Cottage' particularly so with an enormous space. Like all the doors throughtout the complex; nice wide entrances and lots of space. Bright, light and spotlessly clean."
kingsgate centre dunfermline,negative,As above...it needs improvement...noone should face being hurt by a nappy changing unit! 
kingsgate centre dunfermline,positive,"The bus stop is right outside the Kingsgate centre on both sides which is convenient and the bus station is within a 5 minute walk, although the walk may take you over some cobbles. There is little to no parking near-by, the nearest/safest car park would be on New Row which is a 5-10 minute walk away. This can be very busy especially during peak hours. It is also a very steep hill up into the centre on town. There is more parking available at the retail park (Matalan ect) across the main road at the back of the centre but it is a very busy road to cross and exits from the car park are stairs unless walking on the road. There is disabled parking in the car park and the buses stop next door at the bus station. "
kingsgate shopping centre huddersfield,negative,Need a radar key to access. Ok for people who don't need a changing bed and hoist.
kingsgate shopping centre huddersfield,positive,Car park available with lift into shopping centre
kingsholm stadium gloucester,negative,Parking for disabled users is fine. You need to make sure you park close to the ground before the game. You may need to get there 35 to 40 minutes before kick-off as it can get avoid the busy crowd. The disabled toilet at Gloucester rugby ground is okay. You may need a radar key. There are two handrails either side are you to use . The space is adequate
kingshouse hotel ballachulish,positive,"We arrived by car,but there is a public bus service drops off at the road end, a good 3/4 mile away, however the hotel picks up walkers and hikers,and transports them and luggage to next drop off points on West Highland Way, so it may be possible to arrange being met at the road end.  Several Dedicated  disabled parking near entrance to hotel. Might still be a  bit far for those with mobility restrictions. Slight slope to negotiate down to main door.   Accessible toilet in reception area, modern,clean and fresh, plenty of grab rails, plenty of room for turning with wheelchair, lightweight sliding door, emergency assistance cord in place. However signposting could be clearer, sign is quite high up and is intergrated into wooden decor.   We travelled by car, plenty of dedicated accessible parking spaces near entrance to hotel. Glasgow to Uig Citylink bus passes road end, but a good 1/4- 1/2 mile from hotel entrance Large accessible loo off reception , immaculate, plenty of grab rails ( and Arran Aromatics Toiletries!) Signage could be clearer. Bathrooms in bedrooms roomy and accessible with plenty grabrails "
kingsmills hotel inverness,positive,"Disabled parking spaces outside main door of hotel. Other car parking near garden rooms but this is gravel with no disabled spaces. Very central location so I would assume there's good public transport links Only used the toilet in our room but did notice disabled toilets at reception. Arrived by car. Several disabled parking spaces right in front of main reception. Others at the back of the main building. Accessible toilet easy to find, very clean/tidy, grab rails available and had sufficient space for carer. No Changing Places toilet Large car park with disabled spaces near door."
kingspark school dundee,positive,"Disabled parking is definitely 5 stars. There are also accessible drop off points in exactly the right places. Public transport: some local bus services pass by several hundred metres away, probably not the easiest to get to using public transport. Every type of accessible loo imaginable! 5 stars for the loos which were spotlessly clean had decent and colour contrast grab rails. A wide variety of aids & adaptations."
kingston park community centre newcastle upon tyne,positive,"Small car park with 3 disabled spaces. Very close to Kingston Park metro station Easy to find, space to manoeuvre, grab rails, clean and tidy, space for a carer."
kingston park newcastle upon tyne,positive,"I travel by train to Newcastle Central station, then have used both the bus from Eldon Square and on this occasion by the Metro to Bank Foot. Both work well with Bank Foot having the advantage after the game of being quieter and before the busier Kingston Park platform. Central Station platform is now a level entry for wheelchair users with the platform having been raised. In the main concourse of the west stand it is before the bars once you are through the entrance. It's a cubicle large enough to rotate my power chair and has been clean each time I have been to the ground."
kingsway farm dundee,positive,Large car park.  Bus stop nearby. Large accessible toilet with grab rails and red cord.  Clean.
kinnaird head castle and lighthouse museum fraserburgh,positive,There is a good accessible car park just outside the museum entrance with disabled parking spaces. 
kinneil estate boness,negative,No specific disabled bays at the forest car park area but there is normally enough space. The surface is OK but could be better.
kinver edge and the rock houses stourbridge,negative,There are no toilets on this woodland ride
kinver edge and the rock houses stourbridge,positive,"Three woodland car parks are available which are close to openings to get you into the woods, and the paths are compressed soil, perhaps difficult after rain, but otherwise quite easy for your carer. There is no charge for you to see these woods."
kirkcaldy galleries kirkcaldy,negative,"toilets not that clearly marked, there are toilets on each floor disabled toilet is good and has enough space to move, clean and easy to lock/unlock"
kirkcaldy galleries kirkcaldy,positive,parking limited but well marked and a good few disabled parking bays right outside the entrance  Very close to Kirkcaldy train station Perfect other than difficulty in locating the disabled toilets. Better signage would fix that. There is an accessible toilet on each floor but the upper floor one requires a key. Kirkcaldy Galleries couldn’t be in a more accessible location with plenty parking on the grounds and literally right outside the train station in Kirkcaldy as well.  There are accessible toilets on site 
kirkcaldy garden centre kirkcaldy,negative,The toilet is quite small and doubles as baby changing. There is limited circulation space and side transfer space available if you are able to reposition the paper bin.  No red cord. 
kirkcaldy garden centre kirkcaldy,positive,Well placed for a visit by car and Glenrothes bus stops nearby. Ample blue badge parking. 
kirkcaldy railway station kirkcaldy,positive,"Disabled parking is in designated bays in the station car park. Buses run along the nearby road some 100 m distant. Taxis can be booked and the local taxi company has accessible vehicles. The station has an accessible toilet on the South bound platform. The door is automated, the fittings modern and clean. Plenty of space to move around."
kirkcudbright galleries kirkcudbright,negative,"We travelled by car, no carpark, parking was street parking and we had to go around several times to get parked. There was an accessible parking space along from the galleries, but no drop down on the pavement. There are local bus services to Kirkcudbright"
kirkcudbright galleries kirkcudbright,positive,"Roomy  & clean, plenty of grabrails "
kirkcudbright swimming pool kirkcudbright,positive,Spaces located by the door and clearly signed for blue badge holders. Two large loos. One is also a changing room fitted with hoists.
kirkstall abbey leeds,negative,"There is one disabled car parking space by the museum, but other car parking is much further away. There are bus stops on each side of the road directly by both venues, and these are the best option for getting to and from the venue. There are no nearby train stations"
kirroughtree visitor centre newton stewart,positive,You need a car or bike to get there but there is disabled parking that is free. You have to pay for normal parking. Very clean and lots of space to manoeuvre and there is grab rails and the emergency cord touched the ground. There was a shower as well. I think there was plenty of room for a carer but I don't have one.
kisas perth,positive,My husband dropped me off outside. There is a small carpark there. It's just behind the main street so I would assume it's easy to get there by bus. Train station is about a 15 min walk away Toilets are up a ramp. Quite awkward to open the door at the top of the ramp if you're on your own.They are all individual toilets off the corridor. The disabled toilet is large with good grab rails but no red cord
kishorn seafood bar strathcarron,negative,"Reasonably sized car park - gravel though, which I find hard to walk on - and no point using the scooter as no room for it inside. Car park is quite bumpy as it is gravel but my carer managed to push me. Plenty of space but no designated disabled parking places."
kitty cafe leeds,positive,The accessible toilet is large with handrails and handbars in the perfect position for me personally. 
klezmer hois krakow,positive,"The road parallel to the restaurant is a main road which has trams running along. I didn't use the tram while I was there so unable to comment, apart from I noticed that the new trams had wheelchair signs by one of the doors."
knightshayes national trust tiverton,negative,Parking is free for disabled blue bade holders however there is a small fee for non blue badge holders on top of the fee to access the house and gardens.  The disabled toilet was small and I couldn’t turn my chair around in it .It is shared with baby changing table and there was a big bin in the corner making the space even more tighter and hard to manoeuvre within .Both me and my companion could not fit in the toilet together. There was no changing places toilet either. 
knott end working mens club poulton le fylde,negative,Small car park which does get busy on weekend nights - one designated Blue Badge parking bay. There is also plenty of street parking nearby  
knott end working mens club poulton le fylde,positive,Large than average Accessible toilet with grab rails and ample space to move around  Exceptionally clean (Radar Key operated)
knowle solihull,negative,"No public toilets, but can use toilets in any shop or cafe who has one."
knowle solihull,positive,"Parking was quite easy with free disabled parking, very close to the shops on High street, Knowle. Payments were reasonable, slopes onto Main Street quite easy enough to handle, and it’s only a short distance anyway."
knowsley safari prescot,negative,There was 2 disabled toilets but people were using these toilets when they could of maybe used the normal toilet. Priority should be for people with disabilities .
koko london,negative,"I didn't use parking, so I can't comment on that -  but there are plenty of bus stops close by, so public transport is quite straight forward."
koko london,positive,"The accessible toilet is right next to the disabled seating area, and a member of staff is available to open the door if you need them to. Handrails are in the right place, and there's just about enough room to turn, though it isn't the most spacious. Heres a bit of a pill because being London, like down the road from kings cross, it is a major road. I went both times in a taxi and have either had to cross the road to get to the venue or be dropped off at fire exit type door and go all the way round. Which when there is a queue round the building can be a bit slow. The toilets were nice, they just had moveable handles. Their was a nice amount of space. If you needed a hoist or something along those lines it's not suitable though just to bear in mind."
kollensvevet zipline oslo,positive,"We took the metro from Oslo centre out to Holmenkollen, which was amazingly easy and free as we had Oslo passes. Every stop was wheelchair accessible with level entry on and off the train.  I took a star off as the hills from the station to the ski jump were extremely steep and I didn't see a taxi rank or bus service up."
kopenick berlin,positive,Can't comment on parking. Köpenick S-bahn station (accessible) is 1.8 km from the historic centre. The S-bahn station at Spindlersfeld (line S47) is just under 1km & is also accessible. From there it's a level wheel/walk to the Already (apart from the slope up to the bridge) or Tram 61 or Tram 63 to Schlossplatz.
krispy kreme edinburgh,positive,Car park and tram stop
kruger national park komatipoort,positive,At all the gates and at all the camps we saw dedicated disabled parking bays. You can only really get to the Kruger National Park using a car - and except for designated areas - for obvious reasons you have to stay in the car when you're there!  Wherever there were loos there seemed to be an accessible loo. Easy to find and clean and tidy. 
kukina edinburgh,positive,"No parking available, but on several bus routes, which stops and traffic light crossings very near by.    It is on Leith walk, which is a long hill, so the incline might have to be taken into consideration if going up and down hills can be a challenge.  The disabled access bathroom is large with plenty of space, and well through out handrails and easy turn level taps. The door was a bit heavy to push open, but had a lever handle. The lock was a large twist lock."
kulture park glashutte buhlbach freudenstadt,positive,"There is a small carpark with two disabled spaces right by the entrances. There are also wheelchair accessible buses that go from Baiersbronn. The disabled toilet was quite large and clean (the marks on the floor on the photos were worn away paint). There were grab bars, an emergency cord and a mirror that could be adjusted with a handle."
kunsthauswien vienna,positive,"Can't comment on parking. Tram no. 1 gets you to Radetzkyplatz, from where it is about 500 metres on good pavements. Some older Vienna trams are not wheelchair accessible. On the ground floor. Small but well provided with grab rails. Tiling in the Hundertwasser style."
kunsthistorisches museum wien vienna,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. The Museum is next to the Ring, which is well served by trams, and five minutes (level, good pavements) from Museumsquartier U bahn station, which is fully accessible. We only used the one on floor 1. It wasn't very clearly signed but once we found it, it was fine - grab rails, an alarm and reasonable space."
kunstmuseum basel,positive,We travelled on one of Basel's trams which dropped us off nearby. The tram had designated doors for wheelchair users which are clearly signed.
kyle of tongue hostel and holiday park lairg,positive,Park where you camp so easy access to the car. Also good because I like to keep my medication locked away  One of the cleanest well appointed disabled facilities I have seen 
kyloe restaurant grill edinburgh,negative,We came by bus. The restaurant is on the corner of Lothian Road and Princes St so there are many bus options and also a tram stop a few minutes walk away. I am unsure about parking.  On the Kyloe floor there is a gender neutral bathroom but these do not have accessibility features. I used the toilet in the Huxley downstairs. This is taken from my review for there: “ The toilet is a decent size. No Changing Places nearby that I can note. The toilet is not locked so no need to ask staff for a RADAR key. The red cord was not hanging to the floor however.”
kynoch park keith,positive,If you decide to go to Kynoch Park then you've many options!! You can park on the street directly opposite Kynoch Park or you can park in the car park to the right hand side of the ground whitch has plenty of space to get your scooter/wheelchair out of the car :
kyra womens project york,negative,There is no free parking available at Kyra and paid parking is limited on St Saviourgate as it is in the centre of York.  The venue is close to the bus stops at Stonebow in York and has a taxi rank at the end of the street. Once upstairs the bathroom is accessible via a few small steps onto a landing. While clean and tidy it is quite small.
la bambula xabia,positive,"Wheelchair accessible Parking The nearest disabled parking space is in Calle Pireo however, the whole of the promenade is step-free and a great flat rolling surface so you can park in any disabled spaces behind the Arenal Beach area and then wheel to Bambula. If distance walking/rolling is an issue then the disabled space in Calle Pireo is the nearest.  Once you park there, you roll towards the sea and then turn right when you reach the promenade. La Bambula is the last restaurant that you come to. The disabled access toilet had grab rails and was easily accessible for larger electric wheelchairs as well. No hoist though. "
la barantine edinburgh,negative,"Small but sufficient, looking to improve and develop."
la barantine edinburgh,positive,"Well provided bus servic s by Lothian Buses with Disabled, wheelchair access and drop down ramps."
la belle angele edinburgh,negative,"The accessible loo was also on that level, just across at the other side of the room from the reserved seats. If that loo is out of order then the other loos are up half a dozen steps and across the corridor."
la cala de mijas la cala de mijas,negative,"There are disabled toilets that are located next to the beach, and these are accessible via a ramp into them. There is enough space in these toilets to maneuver about, however due to them being open to everyone on the beach this can mean that they are not always the cleanest of toilets because of people coming from the beach to use them, although the local council workers do a good job in trying to keep them clean and monitoring them throughout the whole day.  Most of the restaurants all have disabled friendly toilets and these are very accessible and are kept clean and tidy. I believe most of the restaurants disabled toilets will have room to maneuver and for a carer to also be present. Most of these toilets also have a pull down handle rail.  My advice is if the beach toilets are not accessible enough for an individual's specific needs then  the lifeguards will be more than helpful to point you into the correct direction of what restaurants will have the best disabled toilet facilities, or even the restaurant staff are all very friendly so I would also recommend asking them."
la cala de mijas la cala de mijas,positive,"All of the public transport is very cheap and accessible for wheelchair users which makes it the most ideal way of traveling around the Costa del Sol area. The public bus takes you right into the centre of the town and it is only a couple of minutes  walk away from the beach which is also accessible by wheel chair. However, if you were to drive then there are plenty of disabled parking bays which are local to the beach and the shops, and all of the disabled parking bays have level access ground, making it easy to get around the town and to the beach."
la casa de vegueta las palmas de gran canaria,negative,"The toilet was in a spacious en suit bathroom. It did not have grab rails or an emergency cord. The bathroom was very clean and tidy. The chair in the bedroom could be put in the bathroom to assist with transfers from the toilet and I'm sure Ana, the owner, would move it into the bathroom if you required it."
la casa de vegueta las palmas de gran canaria,positive,"I arrived here by taxi which stopped directly outside the house.  There are lots of buses but I'm unsure how close to the house they stop. Taxis are reasonably priced in Las Palmas and I used them to get about. I would usually walk into town in the morning and get a taxi back at the end of the day and this worked well for me. The accommodation is in Vegueta (Old Town Las Palmas) and some of the streets, including the one the house is on, are on a slight slope. After leaving the house it was a five minute walk to the cathedral  but one of the streets had a very narrow pavement, which wasn't quite wide enough to walk comfortably with my crutch. However the neighbouring streets are quiet so don't be put off by it.  "
la cour de remi bermicourt,positive,"There was a space marked with a Blue Badge symbol near the archway that leads to the hotel and there is ample parking generally. The car park was gravel which could have been a problem, but we were able to park near enough to the pathway to be able to get straight onto it. I don't know if there was an accessible loo in the restaurant but in the bedroom, the very spacious bathroom had some adaptations. The toilet had a grab rail to the left as you sit on it and the shower had one grab rail and a movable stool. You can see from the photos that the shower gel dispenser is too high to be reached from a sitting position and the tiled floor was very slippery but there was a bath mat for the floor amongst the pile of lovely fluffy towels they provided which solved the problem."
la croisette cannes,positive,"The train station is about a 10 minute walk away, and it's on a slight slope down from the station to the sea front. There are also a number of buses that run along La Croisette or stop nearby.  Sorry unable to comment about car parking, but assume it would be expensive given the location."
la favorita edinburgh,negative,Parking might be tricky as it's a fairly busy stretch of road; there are parking bays outside. It's also on the main bus route from and to town so there are loads of accessible buses. The restaurant does have an accessible toilet. On paper it would look good but unfortunately is a little on the small size so turning was out of the question; it was roll in and roll out.
la favorita restaurant edinburgh,positive,"Getting to Favorita was really easy as it is Leith Walk and very hand for the buses. We came down from Princes Street on the bus which was only ten minutes or so. The bus was also very good as it had a wheechair ramp and space for my pal. An accessible loo adjoins the restaurant. It was spacious enough and had everything required. It was spotlessly clean too. La Favorita is on Leith Walk so has plenty of bus stops nearby. We drove and whilst we didn't find any Blue Badge spaces nearby there is on street parking nearby. In addition the fabulous Manager suggested that we ""double"" park right outside the door and he would let us know if anyone needed to move."
la goccia london,negative,In a wheelchair London public transport or parking are not great so I went by taxi from Waterloo and I was kindly pushed back to Waterloo later. Only 3 stars as it was a little messy !
la goleta antigua,positive,"We accessed La Goleta as part of our walk to the harbour area although we did see a car park around 200 yard along from it.  I did not see any designated disabled parking bays in this one but there were behind the building beside which was a hotel. This is one disabled loo that I did use and found it excellent!  It was located in the indoor restaurants behind La Goleta and was shared by all there.    There was lots of room to get my wheelchair in and transfer, with grab rails (one pull down) on both sides.  The loo itself was also raised.  I kept hitting the soap dispenser when getting the loo paper but that was just me.  I wish the one at my hotel was like this."
la piscine couverte village neuf,positive,"4 large bays directly in front of the pool One for boys and one for girls at the main entrance, opposite reception desk."
la pizza cresci nice,positive,The restaurant is on a padestrianised street with buses and trams stopping close by.
la posada molina todos santos,negative,"You can park near the rooms, but the ground is packed dirt / gravel The bathroom was pretty tight, but worked for my manual chair. I showered using a plastic pool chair that I was able to transfer into."
la ptite folie edinburgh,negative,"There was some parking outside, not special areas for the blue badge holders The  bus route was close and the access for mobility scooter the normal cobbles of Edinburgh"
la ranilla puerto de la cruz,positive,"La Ranilla area is near to Plaza Charco, one of the towns main squares, and one where you can be dropped off by taxi or pick one up from the rank. I travelled by taxi, but I think the bus station is near by but I think this would invole walking up a hiil to get to it. From Plaza Charco it is a level walk of a couple of minutes to La Ranilla.   "
la salsa horwich,negative,The loo is big enough for a powerchair however the changing table in the way lets down their accessibility. I'm sure they would move it if asked but I haven't had chance.
la salsa horwich,positive,"On street parking locally and also on the main road, opposite La Salsa is the bus stop. Very large accessible toilet. I didn't see a specific car park but there is on street parking a few streets away and also a big car park behind the sainsburys about 5 minutes walk away (across flat ground). I don't drive but I use a powerchair and it is very easy to get to from Horwich town centre. If I was getting the bus I would get the 125 from Bolton or Chorley as it stops right outside. It's quite far from any train station if walking and disabled but Blackrod is the closest."
la storia nottingham,negative,"No parking for the site but plenty a short walk away, just be careful of the pavements."
la storia nottingham,positive,"At the back of the restaurant, so on a busy day let them know of a disability to they choose a suitable table otherwise it might be tight. Loo itself was great, modern and spacious."
la tasca york,negative,"There are no parking spaces close to the entrance of this restaurant, and there are double yellow lines on most streets surrounding it. The closest car parks are Monk Bar car park or Clifford's Tower, both of which are around 250m away, and the nearest bus stop is approximately 100m away. As La Tasca is located in the heart of York there are many modes of transport that could be used to visit. A Bus stop is situated approximately 100 meters away and Taxi's are always available. There are double yellow lines running on both sides of the street and the restaurant does not have customer parking. There is a dropped kerb outside of the main doors however the cobbled streets and narrow alleyways could cause problems for wheelchair users."
la tasca york,positive,"There is a sizable disabled toilet on the ground floor, with further bathrooms on the 1st floor. These can be accessed using the lift. There is a large disabled toilet on the ground floor which is opened  by a key on request. Additional male and female toilets are located upstairs."
la taverna aviemore,positive,We drove and parked in the restaurant car park which is a decent size. Clean tidy and a decent size.
la vecchia scuola york,negative,There is no parking attached to the restaurant. The nearest parking with disabled parking spaces is o.4 miles away. Taxis can pull up outside the building. There are both separate male and female toilets. The female toilets were quite big however the cubicle which i went in was quite small and would not be big enough to facilitate transfer from wheelchair to toilet. However there could be a bigger cubicle in the toilets to facilitate this.
la vita spuntini glasgow,negative,"There was an accessible toilet on the ground floor which staff helpfully pointed out. Again if you were in a wheelchair it may be a little snug. They also keep spare high chairs in there. The day I visited it had about 30 helium balloons in it, spares for the tables. So hopefully not a usual occurrence.  Grab rails present. "
la vita spuntini glasgow,positive,It’s within 5mins walk from central station. There are disabled parking bays on West Nile Street. Lots of on street parking that you can park in with a disabled badge.
la vita spuntini west end glasgow,negative,"On Byres Rd in West End of Glasgow, so parked behind Jinty McGintys. Car park was really steep but was free with blue badge."
labranda princess gulluk belediyesi,negative,"The hotel has parking spaces right outside the hotel and taxis are available on request. The hotel is built on a hill and realistically, anyone coming to the hotel would need a car of sorts to access the hotel."
ladram bay holiday park budleigh salterton,negative,There were sufficient in front of Reception only 1 in the entertainment area. And ok next to the caravan.
ladram bay holiday park budleigh salterton,positive,"Perfect once able to get upstairs, clean and with appropriate rails."
lady bay west bridgford,negative,"There is a small car park with limited space but this venue is on a main bus route, though some way from the city centre.  It is probably best to arrive (as we did) on foot."
lagan river walk belfast,positive,clean disabled toilets in Dock honesty cafe and Streat cafe
lagan valley leisureplex lisburn,positive,They had a separate part of the car park which is closed off by a barrier.  Only blue bagde holders can use it.  Great 
lagoon leisure centre paisley,negative,"There are disabled bays in the car park, but I'm not sure how many. The space I parked in had a broken/dipped surface directly outside the drivers door, which made transferring in and out of the car quite difficult. Also, the lighting in the car park was very dark, so I didn't feel entirely safe moving from my car across the road to the pavement."
lagoon leisure centre paisley,positive,"The accessible loos had everything I needed and were clean.   There was an accessible changing room in the swimming pool area which had a ceiling hoist and changing table. Large parking area, big enough for bus'es etc.  Good access from main road. Excellant, all entrances are wide enough for wheel chair users, and disabled toilets are available on ground & upper level.  Large carpark with blue badge parking spaces (wide, yellow hatching at sides) Ramp from car park to leisure centre doors. Revolving door with slow button or automatic wheelchair door to the side "
laguna verde burton waters,positive,"Good level parking near by. Closet car park has barrier so if highsided WAV maybe difficult to get in, but alternative space in near carpark and still level Fully accessible toilet, bit tight in manoovering in but still roomy."
laidlaw library leeds,positive,"Accessible toilets are available on each floor, are easy to navigate in a wheelchair and are also well lit. "
laing art gallery newcastle upon tyne,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. The Metro system is fully accessible and the gallery is about five minutes on foot (and on the the level) from Monument Station. Local buses all have manually operated ramps and the drivers we encountered were very helpful. There's one accessible loo in the Marble Hall, and another which is accessed by going through the cafe."
laird dog inn edinburgh,negative,"Parking is ok, but to access the front door, one needs to go by the busy main road. There is no lights, so same people had a bit of problem with that."
lake district calvert trust keswick,positive,"There is a car park and has access from the main road. Calvert Trust also have transport facilities and transport the residents around during their week for the activities. The car park isn't a large car park if every resident wanted to stay the week it would be very full. Every toilet in the main areas are disabled and there are 3 around the reception and the dining room/kitchen. In the bedrooms the bedrooms have walk in showers with a shower seat and rail with assistance around the toilet too including an alarm string in case there was no carer present.  We went by car,  there are mini buses to take you to the activity  They are all accessible!"
lake district disabled holidays crook,positive,"Cars can park right next to the accomdation. There is a ramp up to the front door of the cabin or a couple of shallow steps There are two bathrooms with toilets for disabled people. One is a Wetroom. Plenty of well placed grab rails Easy to find with owners directions. Parking outside the chalet Fully accessible at room and toilet with appropriate hand rails Parking is available directly outside the accommodation with ramp access to the veranda and main entrance.  Directions provided by the owners were clear and easy to follow. This property has two bathrooms, one ensuite to the twin bedded room and a family bathroom. Full access aids for the toilet are provided in both bathrooms We were able to park directly outside the cottage which was a bonus with ramps to allow easy access. Very accessible for wheelchair users. All grab rails in place to allow the user to feel safe and able to assist themselves to mobilise as well. Flat and roomy Both toilets easily accessed whatever type of chair, manual or electric Plenty of level parking/turning room for WAVs . Level access, well-placed support rails and heaps of room. 'Wet-room' style shower is especially easy."
lake garda salo,negative,"There were generally plenty of accessible loos, of varying standards.  Most were usable but generally of a slightly lower standard than expected in the UK."
lake garda salo,positive,"We were in our own car and used disabled parking spaces with my blue badge.  These were generally easy to find, but not numerous.  We also used the ferries on the lake; these were able to take my powerchair, and had lifts to get access to all levels."
lakeland bird of prey centre penrith,positive,Parking is right outside the centre and just a short walk to the tearoom. We got a space easily enough.
lakeland edinburgh,positive,"Great public transport on George Square, Lothian buses 11, 10, 12, 16, 27, 23 and more go right pass.  Parking can be a bit of a nightmare though. Parking is available in George Street in pay and display areas. Blue badge holders may be able to park closer. Accessible buses stop in Hanover Street."
lakeland motor museum newby bridge,positive,"2 Blue Badge bays, on a bus route Reasonable toilet with plenty of grab rails"
lakeland windermere,positive,"Very easy to find, in the same position on both floors, Plenty of room to manoeuvre, and good placement of grab rails and drop down bar. Spotlessly clean. Space for carer. I did not see a changing places toilet. "
lakeside coastal village hampshire,positive,"We drove. We had booked a disabled chalet and there was reserved disabled parking next to it. We didn’t use, but checked out one of them. It was very spacious with plenty of room for a carer and to turn a wheelchair. Plenty of grab rails. We didn’t check the height of the toilet."
lamlash bay hotel lamlash,positive,If you book the Family Suits you have your own entrance which has a ramp - path a bit broken up however effort has been made to create easy access so you can park up close to edge of ramp and wheel straight into apartment The bathroom within the apartment is easy to use as large doorway - shower enclosed though so actual wet room facility
lancaster canal cruises ltd bilsborrow,positive,"there are many venues situated along the canal through lancaster, a booklet informs you of which ones have wheelchair access and other emenities. some of which have steps from the canal over a bridge but many have paths and low level access to local shops such as lancaster city centre specially equipped shower and toilet"
lancaster castle lancaster,positive,On street parking but very steep inclines and cobbles in place to. The Kerbs are very high too from road to pavement
lancaster cathedral lancaster,negative,Parking is limited and the road around the cathedral are narrow and have double yellowlines. There is free disabled parking at Nelson Street Car Park that is down the hill Canal bridge. The Cathedral as easy access for all
lancaster city museum lancaster,negative,bus then walk 
landmark forest adventure park aviemore,positive,"Disabled parking is immediately on entry off main road. Mainline train station half a mile from the venue Has everything required Disabled parking spaces just outside the entrance. Not sure about public transport. Disabled parking spaces right outside the ticket office. Easy access but only if the cafe tables aren't too busy. Big car park, but it does fill up fast. There are spaces close to the ticket office. "
lands end sennen,positive,"We travelled by private car.  The car park was enormous.  We parked in regular parking but as it was on an overflow field, we self spaced and had loads of room."
langass lodge isle of north uist,positive,"This Lodge wasn’t in Lochmaddy but that is the nearest village. It is not far away & is day to find & we’ll sign posted. It is on single track road, don’t be alarmed it is well worth the narrow road there. There were chips on the car parking area but my husband took the car into the front door on the level stone slabs so it was easy to transfer & move into my wheelchair.  Easy to find accessible toilet,  small, in the older piece of the Lodge, but I managed in my wheelchair no problem. Grab rails adequate. The public toilet was smaller but in the room it was large. "
langdale chase hotel windermere,positive,Parking close to the disabled rooms and reception There was no accessible toilet.
langdon nature discovery park basildon,positive,You need a car to get here really as I am not aware of a bus stop nearby. The car park has been greatly expanded but is very rough for the most part. The disabled bays are tarmacked but you still need to cross the rough ground to get out of it. No changing place toilet which is surprising for a new building but a decent disabled toilet.
langham hotel eastbourne,positive,"The Langham Hotel is about a mile from Eastbourne train station and the town centre's shopping area. From outside the train station I took a taxi, about £5 (May 2019). The hotel is on the sea front between the Pier and the Redoubt Fortress, which appears to be the quieter end of he sea front. Throughout my stay I found the taxi drivers all very helpful, immediately taking my suitcase and checking that I was comfortable before we drove off. On the ground floor, where restaurant and bar is there is an accessible toilet, which is labelled ""Disabled Toilet"". The toilet was spacious with grab rails but no emergency cord.  In my room there was a standard toilet with a grab handle."
langley castle hexham,negative,"There was plenty of parking on sight, however there was no disabled car parking space. This was not an issue when I visited as the car park was spacious and aloud for wheelchairs and ramps. A member or staff at the castle told me that there are disabled toilets throughout the castle that are accessible, however I did not actually check this myself as I did not need to use the disabled toilet. I did read a review on trip advisor that claimed the disbanded toilet is behind heavy doors, meaning wheelchair users may need extra assistance of a family member or friend. The individual also stated that the toilets are smaller than your average disabled toilet."
langton greenhouse and garden centre market harborough,positive,"Disabled spaces right by the door, but a totally flat car park so able to use walker.  Tiny gravel so it doesn't stop your wheels.  We saw several people in wheelchairs and they were managing fine. Purpose built disabled toilet with all the handrails you could need."
lannleire gfc dunleer,positive,Toilets can be found in the main complex. They are accessible to all and a disabled toilet is provided.
lapworth museum of geology birmingham,positive,"It is tucked away within the Aston Webb Building of the University of Birmingham campus in Edgbaston, just a few minutes trundle from University railway station. There is limited blue badge parking on campus. Local buses stop fairly close. "
larbert railway station larbert,positive,"Accessible parking bays at each platform and step-free access to ticket desk and machines. There are bus stops nearby, although buses are not very frequent. Taxi ranks are also at both platforms, and on-street parking is available if car parks are full."
largs community garden largs,positive,The community garden is situated directly across from train platform 
largs ferry terminal largs,positive,Drove right up to and parked right outside ferry terminal. Not sure about public transport but Largs does have train station with regular Glasgow trains. Decent sized accessible loo. Had a few bins in that needed rearranging a bit. Red emergency cord tied up which was unfortunate.
las golondrinas barcelona,positive,Plenty of accessible buses stopping at the busy port area.
las iguanas blackpool,positive,"Tram stop across  the road. Bus stops, Taxi's and Multi-Storey Car Park around the corner Clean accessible toilet with decent hand dryer"
las iguanas york,negative,"We taxi-ed in, there were road closures for Christmas shopping but the taxi can normally drive into swinegate in the evening."
las iguanas york,positive,"Staff asked me if I wanted to use the ground floordisabled toilet as soon as I stood. It was kept locked so not used by other customers, so it might be a problem on a packed Saturday. But it was clean and spacious, no bins to restrict movement. "
las piedras hotel alcaucin,positive,"They collect you from Malaga airport in an accessible vehicle and take you on accessible trips each day apart from their change-over days Thursdays and Sundays.    This is great if you for whatever reason hiring your own vehicle abroad is not an option.      2 large accessible loos in the main public area and accessible bathrooms in each of the 5 rooms.   If all accessible loos were like this, life would be good.    Las Piedras provides wheelchair adapted transport in it's own vehicles. Two large accessible loos in public area. Rooms have wet rooms with shower chairs if needed."
las tapas de lola dublin,positive,5 minutes walk from the luas and good bus routes. Limited nearby parking.
laser quest trafford centre manchester,positive,"Parking and public transport is amazing a Trafford centre with plenty of disabled parking bays  Accessible toilets in the Trafford centre are good, I didn’t notice any changing place toilets but I didn’t check so there could still be changing place toilets in the Trafford centre but not sure"
lasswade high school centre bonnyrigg,negative,A majority of the parking lot is used and there are suitable locations near the entrance but could be better as the best parking areas for the disabled are reserved for school buses that only visit in the morning and afternoon
lasswade high school centre bonnyrigg,positive,"The accessible toilets (majority in school section) were pretty good, clean and support bars for access."
latrigg fell keswick,positive,"Only accessible by car, no designated disabled places, just park on the roadside. "
launceston town centre launceston,positive,"There is a multi-story car park near the center of town, which affords easy access to the center of the town. Accessible toilets are available at the Westgate multistory carpark"
laura ashley hotel bowness on windermere,positive,Parking available on courtyard beside main entrance  Large disabled loo with red cord
laura ashley straiton,negative,There are disabled bays close by and if you are there at quiet times are often free. There is a 37 bus that goes close by but using this will depend on your mobility
lauriston castle edinburgh,negative,"There is a small car park just inside the entrance. This is often very busy. There are now two marked disabled bays but the horizontal position of these may make exiting a vehicle difficult for some drivers (see picture). The nearest bus stop is in Davidson’s Mains and the pavement from Davidson’s Mains to the entrance is narrow (see picture).  There is a small car park at the gate but no dedicated blue badge parking. Cars were parked on the grass verge of the drive. It is a few hundred yards to the castle but as this is not accessible I guess you would mainly come here to enjoy the grounds, thus take the trek in your stride.  Parking is by the main entrance and a well made drive takes you to the castle and gardens. It may be possible to park closer if the castle is not too busy. There is an accessible toilet just off the main driveway. It's not obvious but if you follow the signs to the toilets and peer in the entrance lobby you'll see it to your left. Not great on size and difficult to turn as a powerchair user. Clean and tidy; albeit with an enormous bin blocking turning. No grab rail on the door to assist in closing the door."
lawson kitaakita,positive,Car parking is in front of the store with spaces adjacent to the entrance. There are no steps or barriers between the parking area and the front door.  No public transport stops in the area. The shop is on the main road from Aomori to Akira. This store has a spacious and clean accessible toilet. The side transfer space is clear of bins and other equipment.  The toilet has grab rails but no emergency cord. The toilet lock is fitted at knee height on the sliding door.  There is an extra sink inside the accessible toilet as well as a mirror. The main sink is outside of the toilet.
le caprice london,positive,"Le Caprice is tucked away in a cul de sac in St James's. However it is very easy to get to. The nearest tube station is Green Park which has step free access. Also there are lots of buses that stop close by. From Green Park tube take the lift or stairs to the Piccadilly Southside exit. This is the side of the street where Green Park and the Ritz are. Head to the Ritz and continue along till you come to Arlington Street, with the Ritz on it's corner, and turn right. The restaurant is further down on the right hand side of the road. There's are a couple of kerbs to navigate, which are not all drop kerbs."
le domaine   les saules favieres,positive,"There was a designated disabled parking bay but it was on loose pebbles which would have been problematic for my power chair so we used the driveway as a drop-off space for me than my partner parked elsewhere. This wasn't perfect as there was the possibility of blocking other cars but I don't think anyone would really have minded waiting a few moments. From my photos, you can see the drop-down seat in the shower only has grab rails to the left as you sit on it but the loo, which was very high, has rails on either side. There was also an accessible loo for restaurant users."
le flore nice,positive,In pedestrianised Cours Saleya with buses and trams stopping close by.
le haut fresnay juvigny val dandaine,positive,"Covered parking close to door with level access Although we didn’t need the accessible loo as our young man is a doubly incontinent pad wearer, all looked to be  good for those who may need it"
le haut fresnay lore,positive,Hard standing immediately outside the door with cover. There were grabrails on the left as you sat on the loo plus a dropdown rail on the right - I would have liked an additional vertical one. The shower is wheelchair accessible and had grabrails to the left of the drop-down seat and a drop-down rail to the right -- see photos.
le mercury restaurant london,negative,"Several bus routes will drop you off nearby in Upper St. The nearest step-free station is King's Cross, well over a mile away."
le negresco hotel nice,positive,"The hotel is on the Prom des Anglais, with bus stops nearby. They public accessible toilet on the ground floor had recently been refurbished. It was spacious, clean and with a single grab rail on the left hand side. The hotel is on the Prom des Anglais, with bus stops nearby. They public accessible toilet on the ground floor had recently been refurbished. It was spacious, clean and with a single grab rail on the left hand side."
le pain quotidien london,positive,Good sized accessible loo. Only thing its reasonably narrow to get past a pillar from the cafe into the area where the toilets are.
le petit chateau de montbosq saint martin des besaces,positive,Downstairs large bathroom and wide door. Wet room and shower chair suitable for  the disabled.
le pigalle paris,positive,"There is a lift to take you to the accessible toilet which is downstairs. I remember that there was no problem with the toilet which was roomy and most of downstairs was dark, painted red and black."
lea marston shooting club ltd sutton coldfield,positive,"Huge carpark and no problems with the set up  As I do not require this facility I didn’t check, but I’m informed by the ground they have an accessible toilet "
leadenhall market london,negative,"It's in central London, so not easy to drive to or park at.  There is public transport nearby; buses, taxis, underground (Monument, and Bank are the nearest underground stations) but it depends upon your own needs which is most suitable. "
leapark hotel grangemouth,positive,There is a carpark on the hotel grounds with accessible bays. There is also a bus stop outside the hotel that runs along Bo'ness Road.
lee valley hockey and tennis centre london,negative,"There are limited disabled spaces on site which can't be reserved. Nearest underground is Stratford. It's a bit of a hike from there to the venue but this particular event laid on free accessible shuttle bus transfer. Apart from diabolically bad directions to the pick up point and the fact there was no dropped pavement there, the shuttle was great and the driver so very friendly and helpful."
lee valley hockey and tennis centre london,positive,"I visited the accessible loo near reception. The signs were there but really really tiny. The loo was good - reasonable size, grab rails etc. The door was manual but very light touch to open. Only downside was that there's only a single male and a single female able-bodied loo nearby - so of course everyone used the accessible loo rather than wait.  I did notice another block of loos nearby the courts. The loo I visited was not radar key operated."
lee valley velopark london,negative,"It's a bit out of the way in Lee Valley area. We went by train then tube to Stratford Underground station which is a bit convoluted in terms of getting from Jubilee line to exit (poor signposting we thought and several lifts to navigate). There's no parking at the venue for events.  In normal circumstances it's a 20 minute push/walk from tube to velodrome - however West Ham were at home nearby so routes near Westfield were closed off and it took much much further. The organisers had een fit to include flights of stairs on their diversions so we had to go it's alone to find stepfree routes - very poor! Well the loo itself is lovely - well equipped etc. HOWEVER, there are separate ladies and gents disabled loos and they are located inside the respective gender toilets. So firstly you have to travel further to find ""your"" loos.  Then you have to open the heavy door and wheel across to find the accessible one (it's not the one nearest the door). In my case, I can't self propel so my husband had to go into the ladies and then go outside to wait (though if I'd needed help, he would have had to stay!), then tentatively open the door too check if I was ready and it was safe to come back in! NO, NO, NO! Hence score of 1!"
leeds art gallery leeds,negative,"We arrived on a coach. We had difficulty finding the gallery from the sat nav instructions and ended up driving around in a circle until locating it, bad signage. The coach ended up having to drop us in a side street which was had uneven paving some wheelchair users may struggle with. "
leeds art gallery leeds,positive,Clean and tidy standard disabled toilet with a radar lock. 
leeds castle maidstone,negative,The only reason this score is low because currently there is no CP toilet BUT when speaking to a staff member in the castle he brought it up before we did ! Which is encouraging and he advised us there are plans for a CP toilet near the lake area. This would be a good spot as half way from everything. 
leeds castle maidstone,positive,"Parking is good but you are quite a walk away from the main attractions - although you can use a guest services bus. I’m not sure if the land train is accessible we didn’t check.  Unfortunately the water was too high to access the boat on the lake - but there was a ramp. Getting there was very easy. We arrived by motorhome from the M20. It is well signposted and only a few minutes off the motorway. Parking was well organised, with guides to show you where to go. We were directed into the coach park, which is the usual for motorhomes. I think there are blue badge spaces near the entrance. There are plenty of accessible toilets - at least one in each area. These sometimes double up as baby change and they are not RADAR locked, so sometimes I had a bit of a wait. They were mostly clean though and big enough to get in and out with my trike. Large disabled car park near entrance. best way to attend!  Not sure of ease to use public transport links."
leeds central library leeds,positive,"In the centre of town, so good for public transport, but didn't see any disabled parking. There must be some around the city centre but we did not drive and wasn't immediately obvious where it would be.   Very close to taxi stops and bus stops though. "
leeds city museum leeds,positive,"I arrived at the museum from using public transport. It was easy to find the museum and only around ten minutes wheeling from the railway station. There were accessible parking bays in the streets along side the museum. Can't praise the museum enough as there were loads of good accessible loos throughout the building. We were visiting as part of Disabled Access Day and it was fantastic to wheel around the corner when we arrived to discovered a mobile Changing Places toilet! A great idea and much appreciated by some of the other visitors we met. In town so very good for public transport, and I believe there are disabled parking spaces near to the museum. Very easy to find the toilets, very clean and up to standard. Made the visit more relaxing knowing that there were appropriate facilities.  The museum does not have its own car park, but there are multiple city centre car parks nearby, all with disabled parking spaces. There are also plenty of bus stops in the surrounding region, and pedestrian access is mostly via wide, smooth pavements with maintained curb drops, and few steep hills. I believe there are disabled toilets available on each floor, but never having used them I cannot confirm the presence of full changing facilities."
leeds corn exchange leeds,negative,"I've given this a 2.5 only because I couldn't see inside it, the guard informed me it has rails all round and was a good size. He unfortunately didn't have a key to open it. It's located on the basement level floor along with the disabled access."
leeds corn exchange leeds,positive,"Leeds appears to have good disabled access on all the major bus routes and there are parking bays close by, below is a link to a map which  identifies the 4 disabled parking bays near the Corn Exchange. Copy and paste into your browser. http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Car%20Park%20and%20Disabled%20Parking%20Map.pdf Scroll down to the second page and the Corn Exchange is the middle bottom square."
leeds railway station leeds,negative,"Taxi rank needs a separate bay to load onto wheelchair taxi. One small, cramped, dated accessible toilet with RADAR key lock"
leeds railway station leeds,positive,Excellent transport hub for trains to loads of places but be warned; it does get very busy! There are plenty of buses nearby and of course taxis - not all accessible. Off the main concourse there was a small corridor with a large sign announcing the presence of toilets. There was a dedicated accessible toilet just before the barriers where you pay to use the facilities. The door has a RADAR key and a helpful attendant unlocked the door for me and closed the door behind me. Once inside there was a good amount of space and plenty of grab rails. Im not sure how it might work if you needed the assistance of a carer as it was not the widest of rooms. That said it was clean and functional and very welcome after a long journey.
leedsuniversityunion leeds,negative,"The union does not have its own car park, but there are a few car parks dotted around campus that will admit blue-badge holders. There are several prominent bus routes and stops in the surrounding area. The pavement is smooth and relatively level, making pedestrian access ideal."
leedsuniversityunion leeds,positive,"Disabled toilets should be nearby in pretty much every region of the union, and are kept clean. Given that they serve as gender neutral facilities, there can be a wait to access the toilet. Not every disabled toilet has full-changing facilities, but there is at least one that does (it may be best to ask staff about this)."
leekes llanelli,positive,"Several (about 12, I think) disabled car park spaces. Easy to get into. There is only one. It is quite large and well equipped though."
lees diner paisley,positive,"There is the Paisley Centre carpark nearby, and suitable drop off points on the street, public transport links like buses and trains very close by. Toilets are the disabled access bathrooms in the paisley centre itself"
legion falkirk,negative,"We followed the address in the booking which took us to the wrong car park for the Falkirk Wheel.  Ten minutes later we got to the right area but were directed to the lowest car park (the disabled car park nearest the visitor centre) but we were unsure which way to go.  Uphill past two other nearer car parks and then asked to walk over a muddy grass verge rather than following a paved path we saw later, we finally got to the ticket booth."
lego store leicester square london,negative,"It's in central London so driving and parking could be difficult. There is lots of public transport nearby; buses, taxis, underground (Leicester Square is closest) but depends on your individual needs which is most suitable."
lego store leicester square london,positive,"If you have the patience to look for an on street parking space, there are some available. The nearby tube stations are not accessible so I would recommend getting the trip to Green Park station and either taking the bus to Piccadilly Circus or rolling the 0.7 mile to Leicester Square."
legoland discovery centre manchester manchester,negative,Lots of blue badge parking spots BUT it’s the Trafford centre and is very difficult to find a place. Also sat nav sends you round and round as there are tons of car parks. Both myself and my friend parked a good ten minutes walk away in two opposite car parks 
legoland windsor resort windsor,negative,NO CHANGING PLACE TOILETS WITH BENCH AND HOIST Small and always in use as not enough. 
legoland windsor resort windsor,positive,"Disabled Parking is outside the main gates The disabled parking was fine - plenty of space and near the entrance.  Asked a member of staff where the accessible loo was, and it was then easy enough to find. The one I went to opened with my Radar key (so no manky nappies inside - good) and it was clean with plenty of rails. Parking outside of venue but close enough. Shame we have to pay £6 though!"
leighton buzzard railway leighton buzzard,positive,facilities have recently been rebuilt 
leith community education centre edinburgh,negative,Parking is available in the car park to the rear and side of the building. It's a public car park and whilst there are dedicated Blue Badge spaces you are in competition with the folk who want to go and do their shopping. Buses are a bit further away and in varying directions; the nearest being at least 300 metres of more. Not able to find any accessible toilets and no helpful signage to indicate their presence. If this is important to your visit I'd suggesting making contact with the Centre before you set out.
leith community treatment centre edinburgh,positive,Parking available on street and a drop off point is available in the dedicated car park to the rear of the building. Plenty of accessible toilets throughout the Centre. Staff will point you in the right direction if you ask. Different layouts and sizes.
leith library hub edinburgh,negative,"There is no parking, other than on street, associated with this building. But there are good bus services to the library and a bus stop fairly nearby. Limited parking but accessible buses stop very close by."
leith theatre edinburgh,negative,I think there was an accessible loo.   For the men’s I remember that there was a portaloo cabin  that had steps up with a door which is rather awkward. I always felt I had to be really careful and not be pushed off by the door. 
leith theatre edinburgh,positive,"Public transport is pretty great with Lothian buses 7, 14, 21 stopping outside and a 10 around the corner. I think you can get a taxi up to the gates. I am not sure about private parking or blue badges."
lemur landings poole,positive,"Lots of spaces, but these are unmonitored and open to abuse. There are two/three toilets for the disabled, but access is impossible if you cannot walk and the mini lift is out of order!"
lenzie tennis club kirkintilloch,negative,There isn't much parking round about and what is there isn't very well mantained. There is a perfectly good path however which is just a little walk away.
leon london,negative,"Centre London, close to Tate Modern   Not sure, this looks like a pretty heavy pedestrianised area."
leon london,positive,It's in the centre of King Cross Station. see pic
lepe country park southampton,positive,Very impressive that there is both a changing places toilet and another disabled toilet 
lepones italian restaurant oswestry,positive,Small car park but still had disabled space
let loose beverley,positive,"Separate disabled parking area located outside entrance. Slight drawback is that parking in a on gravel surface which may hinder access. One spacious, clean disabled toilet to the far right of the site. Equipped with grab rails, emergency red cord, lowered sink etc. Only minor criticism is a slight raised lip on door frame which may be tricky for wheelchair users."
letchworth post office letchworth garden city,negative,"There is limited parking on the road outside the Post Office but thus us not usually free (busy spot on a busy road). There is a car park to the rear of the Post Office, bit not all tarmaced, and can be a little dangerous getting from car park to PO due lack of path/parked cars (alternative being to take the long way round to stick to paths)"
letoile salon de tea edinburgh,negative,"There is no on street parking but you can park in the nearby Grassmarket - but be aware it is usually very busy. There are buses nearby, but none that stop directly outside."
leuchars railway station leuchars,negative,toilets locked so didn't go in
leuchars railway station leuchars,positive,lots of parking but its busy so you have to get there early. Regular buses into St Andrews every 15 minutes. bus shelter are big enough to accommodate a few people
leuchie house north berwick,negative,"Used Handicabs for transport needs Nearest train station is North Berwick, which is about 10 minutes by taxi, which needs to be pre-booked (no taxi rank) You need to make your own way there  "
leuchie house north berwick,positive,"Plenty of Parking Space/Mini Bus/Taxis from North Berwick. Easy access for all whether in a Wheelchair or not. We drove and there is ample parking at Leuchie House and assistance with loading/unloading All loos are easily accessible, clean with grab rails and ample space to manoeuvre or for a carer.  Assistance is available if required. Lots of space for WAVs and ground is ll flat. Automated front door makes entry and exist easy. There is ample parking including disabled parking and Leuchie has a number of accessible vehicles. All the loos are accessible some with more room than others but I found them all quite easy to use.  All had sufficient room to manoeuvre a self propelled wheel chair and there were.sufficient grab rails There was plenty parking spaces at front entrance. A mini bus fitted to take a number of wheelchairs was there and also vehicles for taking a single wheelchair  I drove there but for people travelling by train help was on hand at the nearby station and the Lruchie minibus picked people up Toilets were fully equipped for disabled assistance and large enough to turn in wheelchair  Passengers can be dropped off right outside the main entrance with parking adjacent.  Leuchie has it's own accessible mini-bus and wheelchair-accessible cars. There are 2 accessible loos on the ground floor - both are spacious enough to accommodate wheelchairs and carers, if neccessary.  They are kept clean and tidy and both are fitted with grab rails and overhead tracking hoists. There is ample parking including disabled spaces.  All loos are accessible with plenty of room for carers if necessary.  They are cleaned and inspected as needed but, at least, once a day. Parking is close to the building. Train to North Berwick with pick up in Leuchie accessible vehicle can be arranged in advance.  Clos-o-Mat in toilets on ground floor. Ceiling hoist installed. Spacious area with ample turning circle.  Ample parking spaces and space. It is a beautiful country house set out in a spacious park. Ground floor disabled bathrooms are very spacious. Bedrooms are very big and the wet rooms which are away from the bedrooms are roomy. This is a country house and not a nursing home. Just feels like home but the home is not a country house! There is ample car parking at Leuchie House.  I traveled by community minibus service as did other guests.  Some had their own wheelchair accessible vehicles. All the toilets, except one on the lower ground level, are accessible with space, grab rails and washbasins easily reachable.  On the lower ground level there is a second toilet/ shower room with space, grab rails, etc, Wish they had tall seats that went over the toilets "
levels cafe and lounge edinburgh,negative,"There is very limited on street parking nearby, but there is a NCP car park pretty much opposite. It's about a 15 minute walk from Princes Street and Holyrood Road has some local Lothian buses."
levels cafe and lounge edinburgh,positive,"Accessible toilet was good, it's located on the ground floor. The red cord was tied up though (which I untied). The nearest station is Waverley and would need a short taxi ride.  If you are able to walk down St. Marys St. there is a bench outside Pinnies and Poppyseeds.   There is an NCP car park exactly opposite.   I am not sure about a bus route This is large and has enough space for a carer it is easily accessible from the cafe.   It was very busy the day we came so probably was very well used."
leven valley stonehouse glasgow,positive,Parking right at front door with dropped kerb
levengrove park dumbarton,positive,"There is a free carpark just next to the park , with several marked disabled bays. Be aware, that when events are on at the Park, it can be very busy, and car-parking can be difficult. The park isn't far from the High Street/shops, and can be walked to from there (where there is also more parking available)  There are buses to the High Street - I am unsure if they come closer to the Park than that.  The nearest train station is Dalreoch, but this  station is inaccessible if using a wheelchair. The next closest is Dumbarton Central which is accessible (though very steep ramps), and bit further away from Park. "
lews castle stornoway,positive,"Lots of wide accessible parking spaces, on tarmac, right beside the front door. Perfect! Gleaming accessible toilet! Modern, high contrast walls and floor, long mirror above sink which is ideal for various viewing heights, option of paper towel or hand dryer. Almost dropped half a star as the emergency cord was looped (not tangled) around a grab rail, but it did still reach the floor beside the toilet.  Plenty allocated disabled parking near entrance. Tarmacadam surface Toilets not well signposted, and corridor a bit narrow , but toilets clean modern, with plenty of room to manoevere wheelchair, more than one accessible toilet available"
lg arena marston green,positive,"Good, lots of spaces but expensive £8.00 Good spacious"
lgbt health and wellbeing edinburgh,negative,"On 3 lothian bus routes including one that leaves from Waverley Steps, and near many others (on Dundas Street, George Street, Princes Street, main bus station). Trams in the vicinity. Waverley is nearest train station (which has banned taxis from entering the station).  Unsure about disabled parking bays. Parking restrictions outside the venue in the daytime, free in the evening (after 6.30?) and at weekends, but in high demand due to city centre location.  Some pay and display bays up the road, also in high demand."
liberty london,negative,There are no step-free stations nearby. Regent St is heaving with buses all the time. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area. 
lidl edinburgh,positive,Blue Badge parking bays are just around the corner from the store's entrance.
lidl glenrothes,negative,"One toilet used by everyone including baby change, but very clean."
life leisure romiley,negative,"There is a toilet in the first aid room.  Has a large cubicle but don't remember seeing any rails. They have recently installed red cords in both changing and toilet areas.  To be honest it is pretty old and grim, but they do keep it fairly clean! "
life leisure romiley,positive,On a good bus route and all Stagecoach buses are accessible.    Two accessible spaces near the door with areas at the side so you can open the doors.  But the car park is on a hill so a bit tricky getting the ramp down on our WAV. 
life science centre newcastle upon tyne,positive,"The train station was very close  As the centre for life is in a busy city, as expected the car parking is limited on site. Luckily for myself I attended the venue with a blue badge holder so we were able to park on site however this had to be prearranged on request to the visit which we thankful looked into the parking before attending. There was a fully accessible car park located close by to the venue called Times Square Car Park opposite the Jurys Inn hotel. The venue is also very close by to the train station and metro There were disabled toilet facilities on all floors which were clean and very spacious. Clean and spacious There are accessible loos and the one I used was a Changing Places loo which was lovely and clean. There was space for a carer. The Life Science Centre is a short walk from Newcastle Central Station and it also therefore has great transport links. Great accessible toilet, just near the entrance. Fairly spacious and red cord hung correctly!"
lifecare edinburgh,negative,"There is some on street parking available for disabled users (single yellow line) but it is limited.   Local buses (29,24,42) stop on Raeburn Place, about 500m from the venue. Cheyne Street's pavements are narrow, however, so its probably better coming down Dean Park Street."
lifecare edinburgh,positive,"There is a disabled toilet and shower, which is roomy (see picture).  There is also a dedicated ambulant disabled toilet."
lighthouse   edinburghs radical bookshop edinburgh,positive,"There is some on street parking on West Nicolson Street and the surrounding streets but it can be quite busy. There are bus stops nearby on Nicolson Street, this is a main bus route with the 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 14, 29, 30, 31, 33, 37, 47 and 49 all stopping on it. The 41 and 42 buses go along Chapel Street. "
lighthouse central prestonpans,positive,"Toilets are accessible ,spacious and clean."
lighthouse poole,positive,The Lighthouse is right opposite Poole bus station and the rail station is very nearby.  There is also a multi storey car park beside the bus station.  There are about 6 disabled parking places outside the venue and a drop off point.  After dropping me at the venue my companion parked ipfor free in Poole Park which is very close to the venue. Very accessible and spacious toilets.
lightwater country shopping village north stainley,positive,"We didn't actually have a disabled badge but there is adequate parking for disabled users, the parking spaces are near to both the theme park and shopping village there was plenty of room for larger cars and there was a path through the car park (however the surface does make it hard to wheel a wheelchair) to walk to the shopping village safely. There was only one, fairly easy to find but some distance from the Granary but central in the shopping village itself  The  disabled toilet is large with plenty of equipment for the user to get up, there is an emergency pull cord inside. My mum who was caring for my nanna and my nanna were able to fit inside."
lime tree cafe canterbury,positive,"Lime Tree is adjacent to the Sainsbury's Local which has 2 designated disabled parking spaces. Disabled toilet is accessed via two doors from café, but doors are tight and not quite as easy as they might be."
lincoln castle lincoln,negative,"We used the easy access castle bus which departs from the garden centre and drops off a few blocks from the castle. Very friendly, good service. Limited parking I believe near the castle."
lincoln castle lincoln,positive,"Next to the prison entrance lift that navigates a short staircase, is a toilet with a ceiling hoist. No changing bench as the room is a large size but not that big. The hoist wasn't advertised! The tall ceiling may mean the hoist doesn't reach the floor."
lincoln cathedral lincoln,negative,"We visited after the Castle, using the Castle bus service from the garden centre. You can use this bus only in the busy season eg mostly Summer."
lincoln memorial washington,negative,We walked from the tidal basin to the Lincoln Memorial. 
lincoln memorial washington,positive,We found transport pretty great in Washington DC - the metro has many accessible stations and the nearest station is Foggy Bottom.
lindisfarne castle holy island,positive,"There's a main car park which leaves a bit of a trek to the castle. So we drove to Blue Badge parking at the foot of the castle since we have elderly folk with us. You have to open a five bar gate to get through to park but there's usually a walker along before long, happy to do it for you.  Check tide timetables to ensure causeway is crossable before setting out - it is impassable at high tide. There's a shuttle bus from car park to castle."
lindisfarne hotel berwick upon tweed,positive,"A car park is available at the hotel. Be very aware of tide and crossing times - this is an island with a causeway. The en suite was easily accessible with raised toilet, grab rails, roll in shower and shower chair and stool."
lindisfarne priory berwick upon tweed,negative,"Toilets are in the accessible car park. At the moment there is a lot of renovation work taking place, so it is all portaloos. There are two 'accessible' portaloos but they aren't big enough to get my chair in and they weren't particularly clean. I opted to go back to the motorhome and use my own."
lindisfarne priory berwick upon tweed,positive,"We travelled by motorhome and that meant we couldn't park in the accessible/coach parking, whichis nearer to the priory. We parked in the main carpark, which is essentially a huge field. Motorhomes are asked to park along the back, which means a long trek uphill on grass (mountain trike needed). The path from the car park to the priory is good, if a little narrow in places and very busy.   It probably goes without saying that you can only cross to Holy Island when the tide is out. They publish safe crossing times online. Don't attempt to cross outside of these. "
lindores abbey distillery cupar,positive,"There is plenty parking on the onsite car park, and disabled parking spaces right at the entrance  There is an accessible toilet on site "
linlithgow palace and peel linlithgow,negative,"Loo is located at the car park near the children's play area and is accessible to wheelchairs. There are no facilities around the loch itself. I was pointed in the direction of the toilets which turned out to be one toilet for all visitors. Wheelchair access to the toilet is not ideal - there is a platform lift to enable access to the corridor that leads to the toilet. Inside is narrow and cluttered, and there was no soap (not even a dispenser?) when I visited.  It was a busy Gala Day (17th June 2017) when we visited parking was very difficult.  The Peel and Loch were lovely flat accessible and picturesque.  We didn't get any where near the disabled parking. "
linlithgow palace and peel linlithgow,positive,"St Ninians car park on the west of the town has several disabled bays right beside the loch. You will need a car as public transport is awkward.  There is accessible parking right outside the Palace. I parked further down the town in the free Water Yett car park as I was visiting other places along the main street. The Water Yett car park gives nice flat access to the Peel, but is a fair walk away and downhill from the Palace.  Linlithgow train station is about a 10 minute walk from the Palace but a few short steep hills will be involved if you take this route.  There are bus stops through the town centre that can drop you off at the foot of the Palace."
linlithgow railway station linlithgow,negative,"This train station is a bit fiddly to get to due to the nature of Linlithgow's town centre itself. The car parks are quite small, but there are frequent buses along Linlithgow's high street."
lintot square southwater,negative,"2 disabled toilets, one upstairs, one downstairs, but NOT changing places toilets"
lintot square southwater,positive,"Very good, has disabled parking outside the doors"
linwood farm paisley,negative,If you are getting dropped by a taxi with a ramp coming out from the side the driver would be better parking beside the kerb outside of the car park.
linwood farm paisley,positive,"Large car park but did not appear to have and designated disabled parking spaces. There is a bus stop out side the building on the dual carriageway. Accessible, clean and fresh disabled toilet with grab rails and emergency alert cord. tolets are very spacious and easy to access."
liston corfu,positive,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced.
little amsterdam banbury,positive,"Car park over road and outside restaurant.  Buses stop about 3 Minutes walk Easy to find. There is a disabled toilet with the drop-down rail and wall mounted grab rails. The door also has a horizontal rail, the toilet is a good size and the staff nearly always help you with the door"
little italy kendal,negative,Parking on-street.
little italy kendal,positive,The building is on two levels with 5 stairs between. I managed those to use the fully accessible loo. If you can't manage that you could go in by the 'upper' door in a chair or scooter. 
little owl chester,positive,Disabled parking bays are close to the entrance.
little red hen coffee shop chester le street,positive,Three disabled parking spaces with plenty of room.

little waitrose london,positive,"Wimbledon Station is step-free for the Tramlink service, you can get ramp assistance for suburban trains, there are lifts to all platforms, and there are plenty of buses serving the immediate area. There is also a taxi rank nearby."
liverpool empire theatre liverpool,negative,There was 1 accessible toilet near my theatre seat in the stalls - which meant a huge queue at the interval. We were parked  on side street next to empire in car park. Easy enough.but on street is limited. Stalls only have one disabled toilet which can get busy at interval so be advised go just before the interval to toilet and beat queue. We parked in a nearby side street Only one toilet on our floor and their was a long queue at the break time. There's two. The ground floor toilet seems wide enough but the door is quite heavy. I think the red cord is in the wrong place. The soap dispenser is at a good height and easy (for me) to push and the hand dryer is also at a good height. 
liverpool everyman theatre liverpool,positive,Changing place fully equipped 
liverpool lime street railway station liverpool,positive,"Don't know so much about parking, but when I arrived at the station I found the taxi rank very quickly. The taxi rank is sheltered as well - I managed to hide from Storm Doris! "
liverpool one liverpool,positive,"There are many designated disabled bays are available, within the main Liverpool one (Q park) car park. There are 81 available spaces spread across all floors of the carpark. On the third floor where shopmoblity is located there are many bays located near the service.  Shopmobility are Liverpool one’s accessibility partners. The service involves the loaning of mobility equipment such as manual and electric wheelchairs and mobility scooters to visitors.  There are disabled toilets, with an electronic hoist and sensory aids. There is also one of the only Adult Change Facilities in the North West however access to these facilities requires a key which must be obtained from a member of staff which is a slight inconvenience. "
livingston designer outlet livingston,negative,"For the size of the car park there is very limited blue badge parking. You don't get any ""free"" time and have to pay to park. Only found 2 in the entire centre and one is up a very steep, long ramp."
livingston designer outlet livingston,positive,Nearest bus stop was right outside of the centre quite difficult to find but there were a couple toilets

llanerchaeron near aberaeron,positive,You would need to travel in a car to this venue but there are plenty of disabled spaces including a vehicle electrical charging point.
loading london,negative,"There are nearby bus stops & taxis can stop close too, but the nearest accessible tube stations are Hammersmith & Wood Lane, both quite far from the pub."
locanda de gusti edinburgh,positive,Lots of close by bus links. Near to the train station. You could also park in the co-op car park for up to 2 hours. Blue badge holders are also able to park outside the chest and heart charity shop which is very close to the entrance. Large dedicated disabled toilets that was nice and clean. The only real issues was that it could be a bit difficult to get to with the tables being close to one another
loch fyne dartford,negative,"There is plenty of disabled parking at Bluewater in general, but none right in front of the restaurants if you just want to eat. The nearest parking is in front of House of Fraser, and the outside footpath from that set of parking to the restaurants is poorly built and too steep."
loch fyne restaurant edinburgh,negative,"Rather hard to find, and the walk (and smell) may put some people off but duckboards have been put down.  Unless you know where you are going, transport leaves a bit to be desired. Tucked away but easy to use, a good size and clean.  The worst part is the door."
loch fyne restaurant edinburgh,positive,There is a car park at the back of the restaurant that is free and is accessed via Newhaven Place. They lose one mark as there is some cobbles which are a bit uneven to get to the ramp. toilets were of a good size and clean. Ample parking round the back.
loch insh outdoor centre kingussie,positive,"Bathroom in chalet was a wet room.  We drove, plenty of parking at both the chalet and the water sports centre.  I took off a half mark as the chalet parking is on thick gravel which I found a bit hard to walk on with my crutches. It’s important to say that don’t say this is an adapted chalet, just that it’s accessible.  The bathroom is a wet room, while a little small, it’s perfect if you are ambulant like me.  I did have issues with the toilet, as it was too low and the only handrail was really badly place.  However I expected as much and asked in advance for a toilet seat raiser and stand.  They were amazing and got one for me. Plenty of parking at the water-sports centre including 3 wheelchair bays."
loch leven heritage trail kinross,positive,Lots of parking at Kirkgate Park Close to play park and less than 10 minutes to the cafe. All flat with good views if the Loch. It would be a short walk from Kinross town centre which is served by busses.  A perfectly functional toilet cubicle. 20p or a radar key for access. In the country so no emergency cord. 
loch levens larder kinross,negative,"Floor a bit grubby, cord tied at curling height, bins by toilet."
loch levens larder kinross,positive,"Not sure if there is public transport - it is quite rural. If you drive there's a large car park with plenty of disabled parking spaces near the door.  Its only a little off the beaten track from Kinross and I 'think' buses pass by the entrance. We drive, and parking can be hectic at busy times but there is a few disabled spaces within a few metres of entrance. Ample."
loch lomond and the trossachs national park alexandria,negative,Outside toilet which is accessible but did feel exposed and there was a queue.
loch lomond and the trossachs national park alexandria,positive,Parking is a short distance from the main meeting point at the Tourist Information Office.
loch lomond bird of prey centre balloch,negative,"There are, unfortunately, no disabled toilets available in the actual centre. However, there are some within the shopping venue the centre is attached to. They are adequately sign posted and easy to find. They were quite spacious, has a grab rail, easy to manoeuvre in and has enough room for a carer. However, the toilet definitely could have been cleaner."
loch lomond bird of prey centre balloch,positive,"We came in on the train which is a 10 to 15 minute walk away. There is a taxi rank outside the station as well as a regular bus service. We also observed disabled parking spaces in the car park Lomond Shores (where the Bird of Prey Centre is) has a large car park, with many marked disabled bays, a drop-off point, and coach parking.  The nearest train station is in Balloch, which is probably about a 10-15 minute walk away (although there is also a taxi rank immediately outside the station). Buses also do come to the area. The main toilets were very spacious, the accessible toilets within the main blocks (2 male, 2 female)  were large with enough room for a carer.  On one side of the toilet there was a support fixed to the wall, and on the other side the support could be folded down. There is another individual accessible toilet within Lomond Shores. They are all signposted. "
loch lomond faerie trail luss,positive,the loo was situated with the normal ones right next to the less abled parking
loch lomond shores balloch,positive,There is a park in front of the main entrance and it's easy to get there eventually by train or bus.  There are disabled toilets and it was easy to get there 
loch lubnaig callander,positive,Ace! We drove - I'm not sure if it is possible to stop here with out driving. There is also overnight parking for caravans too. Be aware that they do lock the gates in the evenings. Great! There is a decent sized accessible loo which was clean and tidy. There was a keypad lock on the door which I presume is locked when the car park gates are locked.
loch melfort hotel oban,negative,Loo in room was below average height definitely not good for disabled with only one grab rail.  Wash hand basin was normal height but too high for someone in a power wheelchair.
loch melfort hotel oban,positive,We parked right outside our room as the host is set up as part motel. Access to the room was via a ramp at the end of the car park and along a covered path.
loch ness centre exhibition inverness,positive,"The Centre is on the main road running down from Inverness alongside the Loch Ness. It’s about fourteen miles until you reach the village of Drumnadrochit.  There are plenty of parking spaces and a row of accessible parking bays can be found as you enter the one way route. From here it’s a short stroll across the garden area to the entrance to the exhibition.  There are toilets in several areas but the main accessible toilets, the largest, are in the dedicated toilet block adjacent to the entrance paths. The toilets include the accessible toilet, spacious, clean and well laid out."

There is also a magnificent accessible changing room with 2 height adjustable beds, 2 showers & toilet with grabrails. there were also lockers & the aforementioned trach hoist. "
lochgilphead joint campus lochgilphead,positive,A few (maybe 5 or so) designated disabled parking spaces. Loads of room. Hoist available. Railings
lochgreen house hotel spa troon,positive,We normally go by car and there is plenty of accessible parking available outside the hotel. There may be public transport options available but I have not investigated these options yet  There is an accessible toilet near the main dining room it is however quite small and the toilet is very low. It has handrails. I put a  card on the red cord during my last visit.
lochore meadows country park lochore,positive,"Plenty of disabled parking right next to the visitors centre and cafe. Excellent toilet with hoist and changing table. Is accessed via radar key, one is available at reception if needed. There is a large car park with five blue badge spaces.  There is a very well equipped changing places toilet with bifold door and all facilities for toileting and changing. There is a basic accessible toilet in the cafe. This has a heavy spring to the door and no alarm facility."
lochside house hotel and spa new cumnock,positive,Disabled parking beside main entrance
lockards farm pub dumfries,positive,"I took the wheelchair taxi, but public buses will stop here, and large car park with several dedicated accessible spaces Quite a distance at the back of the premises, but clean,large and roomy, with all you would expect from an accessible loo. Door to access toilet a bit heavy Designated disabled parking,plenty of spaces. Access and drop downs to cross over road to Peel Shopping center.  Quite a distance to walk to main entrance from Carpark for those with mobility issues Located at back of restaurant, again quite a distance. Fully accessible toilet plenty of room to turn wheelchair. Plenty of grab rails, safety cord in situ.  A bit smelly, as with many places the disabled toilet doubles up with the nappy changing facilities. Only problem was outer door to access toilets, quite a heavy door, needed assistance to open it"
locomotion shildon,positive,"The best way to reach the museum is by car and there are Disabled Spaces "" in the lower car park. I would not recommend using public transport. The accessible loos were easily reached and very clean. There is room for a wheelchair to maneuver but  possibly the floor area is a little small for  large wheelchairs. The toilets were very clean and there are grab bars."
lodge on loch lomond alexandria,negative,"There is a steep hill outside reception. Very poor, situated in ladies toilet and cannot take a wheelchair and get the door closed."
lodge on loch lomond alexandria,positive,A disabled bay just down from the main entrance. It is a little steep to get from the space to the entrance with luggage though. The toilet in our room was accessible but the shower was a standard over bath shower with 1 grab rail. You would expect better for an accessible room. The accessible toilet is back in reception. It is very well lit and has a drop down grab rail on one side and a fixed one on the other. The red cord does not quite go to the floor. Entry is via a sliding door which is quite heavy but which I find easier than maneuvering a chair around an awkwardly opening door. There is plenty of room for a wheelchair and assistant. This toilet is also the baby change.
lodore falls hotel spa keswick,negative,Gravel around suitable parking too deep.
loks bar kitchen glasgow,negative,on Street parking but very busy There is a carpark for the football club next door which offers a level pathway to the ramped side door but spaces are minimal and on street parking is always jam packed.
loks bar kitchen glasgow,positive,"clean, freshly painted, large, uncluttered and easily accessible. There are a different transport links couple of hundred yards from the door. One of these is Pollockshaws East railway station but it is inaccessible for wheelchair users. There is a good or service. Although I've not shown a great picture the toilet was very good. It has a bi-folding door which are great space savers."
lollapalooza paris paris,negative,"There were basic festival accessible toilets but everyone was using them and I noticed that wheelchair users were being overtaken in the queue, however, on the second day my P.A. pointed out that there was someone guarding one of the disabled toilets to ensure that they were being used appropriately. "
lollapalooza paris paris,positive,"On-site disabled parking was really good and secure but I've only given 4 stars because of the other transport options available to the site.  There were buses and the Metro was also available too from central Paris.  My other able-bodied friends took the Metro and said that it was inaccessible due to the crowds, broken lifts, stairs and there was a very long walk to the Metro due to the way the police were diverting the crowd. "
london aquatics centre london,negative,"Both the Blue Badge parking zone and the drop-off point are much further away from the venue entrance (itself up one floor via an unmarked lift) than anyone can walk who qualifies for a Badge. If your mobility is restricted, don't think about coming here without a powered chair or scooter, or - unless you are a Paralympian - someone to push you in a manual chair. Not sure how this got past the planners."
london brewery tours london,positive,"We parked easily near to the first Brewery on the Tour. The Southwark Brewery. Only one of the breweries did not have acceptable access to disabled toilets, this is being addressed. See full article."
london bridge underground station london,negative,There's lifts throughout the station. Wide gate.  Ramps are available for deploying but there's a reluctance to do so.
london bridge underground station london,positive,"The Jubilee Line offers accessible connections to several places and is one of the more accessible tube lines. There are new toilets in the concourse of the station. Green lines on the floor direct you to their location. A call button will summon assistance at the gates if no one is around to let you in. A large, modern accessible cubicle is a short distance from the barriers and has a RADAR style lock."
london buses london,positive,The bus is the transport - and it was great!
london canal museum london,negative,"There is a good accessible toilet but it has a major flaw: the red emergency cord ends well over a metre above the ground. This is useless for the very situations it's designed for, namely when someone doing the precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet falls to the floor and is injured. The cord should reach all the way to the floor. Astonishing that, in a museum where accessibility has been thought through so well, this detail has been messed up."
london canal museum london,positive,"The Museum is quite near King's Cross Station, which is step-free. Canal museum is located a short distance from Kings Cross station. Great. Right at the entrance, clearly signed and with a red cord hanging correctly. Very close to Kings Cross Station. Buses run nearby and some on street parking. And of course, you could arrive via the Canal. There is an accessible toilet in the foyer area. A wide door open outward, there's a good space, everything in reach and spotlessly clean."
london charing cross railway station london,positive,"Quick and easy to board when we asked for a ramp. Good service. Free, opposite M&S foods. RADAR key. Makes a loud alarm on entering bad when pressing the button to lock/unlock the door. Good space, noisy hand dryer. Light goes off after 5 mins so I should have taken a torch!! A busy station served by accessible buses and taxis. An accessible toilet is located just off the main concourse. A quick enquiry at the information desk and they will tell you where it is. The door has a RADAR key, it is super spacious, has grab rails, and is clean and tidy."
london city airport london,negative,"Don't know anything about parking or taxis, I've always got onto the DLR. The train station is a good 800m away on a gentle uphill (from airport to station) slope on tarmac surface. Sometimes the staff will  A lift takes you to the platform. This part of the network is very accessible indeed as it's all the new Jubilee extension and DLR, so you can roll on and off trains. For central London, you can get the DLR to the Jubilee line and go to Green Park, just be sure to look for a sign somewhere on the plaform area with a wheelchair symbol as only SOME of the carriages are level access at Green Park, and you will need to have got on in the middle of the train. "
london eye london,negative,"They have only one in county hall and there is always a line need more disabled loos There are nearby bus stops & taxi ranks, but not accessible tube stations."
london eye london,positive,"There are large accessible toilets in the booking hall. Staff will help with directions as they are tucked away around a corner. It's on London's Southbank - we were staying nearby so it was easy to get to. It's near Waterloo station and on many bus routes too. Not sure whether there is any accessible parking nearby. We travelled by train and the nearest station, Waterloo, has step-free access. The London Eye is a short (7-8 mins) walk away towards the river, although it is not well sign-posted. We didn't use the toilets but I did look at them, accessible toilets are in the main hall where tickets are picked up. went by train right into waterloo.  they forgot about me on train so was a bit upsetting We went by taxi, and there is a tax rank as near as possible to the Eye itself"
london eye river cruise london,positive,"Nearest place that any transport can get is the other side of the London Eye, about a 5 minute walk to where the boats leave from"
london graphic centre london,negative,"This shop is in the heart of Covent Garden and although buses serve the surrounding area, they will not drop you off nearby. There are no step-free stations nearby. At some point from 2017 you will be able to use the new Tottenham Court Road station, which should be fully step-free."
london heathrow marriott hotel hayes,positive,There is parking facilities and the hotel is perfect for Heathrow airport. There is just a short bus ride to the underground Piccadilly line to take you into central London. Accessible toilet on the ground floor near the restaurant and accessible room has generous wet room.
london luton airport luton,negative,"At the moment (December 2016) Luton Airport is undergoing major building work and due to this there are some temporary alterations on the site. The nearest train station is Luton Parkway and from there is a shuttle bus (extra charge) to take you to the airport. As I was travelling alone I decided to arrive by taxi, rather than struggle with the shuttle bus, and the taxi stopped as close as it could to the airport entrance. As part of the upgrade of the airport there are plans to improve public transport access."
london luton airport luton,positive,There are disabled accessible toilets with wide cubicles and grab rails located throughout the airport. Toilets were clean. One of the toilets I went into the emergency alarm cord did not reach the ground and I reported I to staff.
london marylebone railway station london,negative,"There is a middle of the road pavement which has no dropped curbs so be careful you are not dropped off here! At the front of the taxi queue there is a cobblestoned area with space for vehicles to pull in There are RADAR key accessible toilets however the female toilet only has one side drop rail, on the other side there is only one vertical wall mounted rail next to the toilet cistern so there is absolutely nothing to hold you or help you get up on one side. See photo."
london marylebone railway station london,positive,"Assistance from the train is pretty good. The staff are friendly and helpful. There is a taxi rank outside and buses also run from just outside. You can't access the tubes if you are a wheelchair user, but then they aren't great for wheelies anyway. Great loo in the Ladies accessed via radar key (I don't know about the Gents...). Always spotless and the staff are lovely."
london paddington railway station london,positive,It's a transport hub so that means it's facilities are great. The assistance team are wonderful.  The taxi rank is a long way from the platform's but there's good signage and a lift for access.  I'm not sure how accessible the tube station is.
london palladium london,negative,There is just one wheelchair accessible toilet for 8 plus wheelchair users plus patrons with walking difficulties. The toilet was dirty prior to the performance and during the interval. 
london palladium london,positive,I travelled by tube from London Bridge to Green Park Tube station which is a fully wheelchair accessible. You can also arrive via Bond Street tube which is also wheelchair accessible and less than 10 minutes walk/wheel from the theatre. Disabled parking spaces outside venue Cleanish but roomy. Acceptable
london stadium london,positive,Stratford is an accessible station and there are people in bright pink t shirts greeting you when you arrive. They direct you to the accessibility transport to the venue. We weee told where to come after the concert to be returned to the station. The people operating the minibuses were lovely and made the journey easy. I’ve never started a concert so easily. You are dropped next to an accessible entrance so really easy to use public transport. 
london victoria railway and underground station london,negative,"There are two reasonably spacious accessible toilets on the station, one of them hidden away in a tunnel near Platform 1, the other on the main concourse, both accessible by RADAR key. Red emergency cords are normally tied up out of reach, which is disgraceful and puts people in danger if they need to summon assistance after falling over - two stars lost for this failure."
london victoria railway and underground station london,positive,"There is an NCP car park nearby and a further car park on Eccleston Bridge. It is possible to get assistance at short notice from the generally friendly platform staff if you want to travel by National Rail, even though Southern Rail advise you to book ahead a scandalous *24* (!!!) hours in advance for assistance.   The station is served by swarms of buses and is the terminus for many train services heading south of London. For the tube there is step-free access to all lines.   The Victoria Line is step-free from street to train. The District and Circle lines are step-free from street to platform, and manual boarding ramps are available, speak to staff at the ticket barrier before you travel, to seek ramp assistance for the District and Circle lines.   If you are sensitive to loud noise, be sure to cover your ears in lift 'E', where the announcements are ridiculously loud and shrill. "
longacres garden centre bagshot,positive,Good disabled parking in two areas - the larger by the entrance & a smaller by the exit. Longacres is only access by car.  There is an accessible toilet which is well signed & conveniently located & close to the cafe.
longniddry bents 3 longniddry,positive,"There is a great deal of parking space, although none of the spaces are specifically Blue Badge ones. When you enter there is some parking in front of you, but much more over to the right beyond the kiosk which is not immediately visible. Almost all of the parking is tarmac.  Parking for Blue Badge holders is free but there is a small charge for others. There is a new toilet block with easy access - see photo. It is operated with a RADAR key. The accessible toilet seems to be a Changing Places one which must be very new as it was not on their website when I last checked. One big drawback for us is that there was only a grip on one side of the toilet. My relative needs to push herself up with both hands. "
longniddry inn longniddry,negative,"There is a small car park although being somewhat out of the way driving to this venue may be the only option. Large, clean and well appointed - although there is an awkward turn to get in."
longparke farmshop cafe dundee,negative,"The large car park for Longparke is situated beside the building and has 3 accessible parking spaces right outside the entrance. The ground of the car park is covered in grey gravel which was challenging for my powerchair, especially in thicker areas. Luckily, beside the accessible parking spaces there was paved slabs at eithers sides of the space. This is great because it’s a smoother surface for people to transfer to their wheelchairs, walk on or drive on. Unfortunately, though I exit my car from the back where there’s no paved slabs but, I managed to drive through the gravel and get on to the slabs. If there were no accessible spaces available wheelchair users may struggle to visit because of the gravel all around the other spaces, also parking spaces aren’t marked so there’s the problem of others parking too close. Accessible parking isn’t easily sign posted when you first enter the car park but, it’s usually near entrances so that’s where we headed.  Dobbies Garden Centre is beside Longparke and there is a bus stop there. However, when you walk from Dobbies to Longparke, you would struggle to cross over the road because there is no dipped kerb. You would also need to walk up the road to Longparke because there is no pavement. The same problem would also occur with the gravel in the car park. If you walked to Longparke from the main road I feel wheelchairs especially, would get stuck in the gravel. "
longparke farmshop cafe dundee,positive,"There is an accessible toilet within the Farm shop area of Longparke. It is a reasonable size for an accessible toilet, with enough turning space for a wheelchair/powerchair and space for two people if someone requires assistance. Within the toilet there is a small baby change bench and grab rails beside the toilet and sink. There are two bins inside the accessible toilet however, when I visited, they were neatly tucked in the corner. The emergency red cord was tied around one of the grab rails which I untied before I left and left a Euan’s Guide card.  It would be good if there was a Changing Places toilet though, to allow customers who are unable to use standard accessible toilets to visit too.  There are 2/3 disabled bays at the front entrance with paths to the front and sides. The car park is gravel and looked very much like it’d be a struggle, luckily I could get straight onto the pavement and had no issues getting in. There are bus stops nearby. "
lookers volkswagen carlisle,positive,We travelled by car.Dedicated disabled parking space at the door.
lords cricket ground london,negative,"There are plenty of parking spaces on nearby roads if you go early on a weekend. However, there is are no allocated accessible parking spaces in the ground and members of the MCC or Middlesex CC take precedence over disabled visitors. The parking you can book via Lords has no specific accessible spaces and is a bit of a trek away. It's also expensive at £26."
lords cricket ground london,positive,"Parking or a drop off can be easily arranged , very close to the stands which helps of course Quite a number available at each stand There are plenty of accesible toilets, using RADAR keys. The Grandstand toilets are pretty new and I think the nicest."
loreburne shopping centre dumfries,negative,"my  gran is disabled as she has left side paralysis and finds it hard to walk long distances. the parking spaces available at the centre are virtually nothing, therefore my gran found it extremely hard to enjoy herself. Out of the whole place all we could find was one disabled toilet and the worst of it was that is was at the end of the centre downhill, the only lift takes forever to get on and the escalator is far to fast, gran almost fell."
loreburne shopping centre dumfries,positive,"There are a limited number of dedicated accessible parking spaces in the car park under the centre, one on Irish St at the rear of the centre and one in Marks and Spencer’s carpark also at the rear. There is a public bus service with a dedicated bus stance at the south end entrance. Point of note the Pavement at rear of the centre is very narrow and on a slope, my power chair veered off the pavement into the road in damp  weather, and narrowly avoided tipping,so we tend to avoid Using the parking space in Irish Street. I travelled by wheelchair taxi on this occasion. 2 accessible loos at bus stance entrance along a narrow corridor. Signage only at one end of centre pointing to where they are. I was intercepted by a member of staff who advised that the first disabled toilet was not big enough for a wheelchair and guided me to the further away toilet which was clean & roomy, plenty of grab rails and assistance cord. I left a Euan’s Guide red cord card, as cord tied up. Radar key system in place to access loo"
lotherton hall leeds,negative,The venues car park is situated near the gardens but it is quite a walk through the gardens to the resturant and bird garden area.
lotherton hall leeds,positive,Blue badge spaces. I went by car and suspect there aren't public transport options  There was a changing places toilet.  Lovely Changing Places toilet next to the cafe. The toilets are situated in a very central position although there is only one
lothian buses edinburgh,positive,"The bus service in Edinburgh is great, with regular buses that travel all over the Lothian area.  Also their website has a route planner which is excellent for planning your journey."
loudons cafe edinburgh,negative,Good bus connections.  No disabled bays nearby.  Two unrestricted spaces just along from the front entrance.  Can park on double lines on street to the rear - no waiting restrictions but one of the residents isn't happy about that. We arrived by bus which was handy as it ran along the street outside. Could be tricky with parking as there were lots of yellow lines because of the primary school opposite. No great parking near by. The 1/34/35 bus stops right outside. Taxi rank is opposite on other side of Rd. Short walk to the canal. 
loudons cafe edinburgh,positive,"I came by bus - there is a Lothian bus stop directly outside the restaurant and buses regularly pass going to and from the city centre. The Fountainbridge area is close to Haymarket and some parking on side streets. Good disabled toilet.  Also a baby chance and sometimes the bins smell. Not sure about parking as we walked here. However there is a bus stop right outside it and one directly across from it. Good toilets once you're in, the only issue is that you go through a relatively heavy door and the toilet is a sharp turn on the right. It could be a bit of an issue to navigate! A good accessible toilet is immediately of the cafe area. Bright, light and fit for purpose. The approach to the door was better than expected as there is a clear path running from the door and along to the serving area. Taxi could stop right outside. All pavements in the vicinity in good nick, with dropped kerbs. Lots of buses on Lothian Road and Fountainbridge. I took off one star because I'm not sure if there's any parking close by. Accessible loo is obvious and has a separate door from the other loos. Lots of space to manoeuvre. Plenty of grab rails. Hand dryer is actually beside the sink, which you don't always get! The only difficulty is that it's a pull door to get out - but it's not too heavy. Loudons is close to both the city centre and Fountainbridge cinema and bowling complex and is on several bus routes. There are several car parks nearby but we didn't try these out."
louie browns dalgety bay,negative,There is plenty parking but only 2 disabled spaces and they're not together by the door as would be usual.
louie browns dalgety bay,positive,Disabled toilet had enough space and was clean and tidy. It's one of the nicest smelling toilets I've ever been in! We drove. Might be tricky by public transport. Large car park with disabled spaces Large disabled toilet. Through slightly heavy double doors to enter toilet area A number of disabled parking bay available in the car park. Good
louth library louth,negative,"There is a parking area located outside the Library, but this appears to only allow for 2 - 3 cars. There is a small driveway area in front of the library which allows for drop off and pick up directly outside the library entrance. There are several car parks located in close proximity to the library, as well as off road parking. There are disabled toilet facilities in the library but these were allocated on the first floor of the building where there is a function room. However, there is sufficient lift access to the disabled toilet upstairs, and the area upstairs is very spacious for wheelchair access. The disabled toilet had a large door which allowed easy wheelchair access, and space within the toilet for maneuvering a wheelchair. There was a grab rail which is beneficial in aiding support when transferring on and off the toilet."
louth wyevale garden centre louth,positive,"A fairly good number of Blue Badge parking spaces and we managed to get parked fine and there was plenty of room to get my wheelchair out of the car and for me to transfer. There was an accessible loo with radar key access. Room to manoeuvre my wheelchair and for a carer to come in. Grab rails. The emergency red cord was tucked behind the pipes but it was hanging to the for so I freed it, unfortunately I left my red cord cards at home. It was found clean and tidy."
lovecrumbs edinburgh,negative,It’s a busy one way section of the street with some parking - although it’s almost always full. Some buses nearby in Stockbridge. 
low barns nature reserve visitor centre bishop auckland,positive,"This venue is easy to access but there is no public transport directly to the site. We parked on the site and there is parking for disabled. There is a small charge for parking. There is 1 accessible loo which was well planned, spacious and very clean.  There was a grab rail and space for a carer.  No Changing Places Toilets. The main  A68 road takes you to Witton Le Wear and then it is a short diversion through the village to the Reserve.  The  road to the Reserve is well sign posted and there is adequate parking all on the flat, including two disabled parking bays. There is a charge  of £2.50 per car and this entitle you to enjoy the reserve all day. I do not know of any local public transport which goes to the Reserve. The disabled toilet is easily found and there is adequate wheelchair space for maneuvering. Grab rails are also provided. The toilet was quite clean."
lower leas coastal park folkestone,negative,I didn't use the toilets here so I can't really comment on them
lower leas coastal park folkestone,positive,"There is a car park on-site but it wasn't clear where the disabled parking was so we had to pay for the parking, which seemed a bit expensive."
lowther pavilion lytham st annes,negative,There were parking facilities however it was extremely busy and there were not many spaces left. We had to park on the main road in which there may have not been enough room for a ramp to assemble from a vehicle. There was a basic 'disabled toilet' in which was also a baby changing unit.
lse pankhurst house and fawcett house london,positive,I used the toilet on the upper floor where the drinks reception was held. The accessible toilet was spacious and clean with grab rails. The emergency cord was wrapped around the grab rail and I untied it.
lu shan chinese restaurant bembridge,positive,On a main bus route - hourly bus service On road parking outside.  Accessible toilet Large enough to turn a chair around one grab rail 
lucas kitchen dunfermline,positive,"We walked but there is a large car park right outside the restaurant.  toilets were easy access on the flat although I did not visit the disabled toilets myself, my friend used the gents and said it was spotless."
lucky days york,negative,"The cafe situated in a popular location, within the city centre where there isn't disabled parking. However we chose to park not too far from the venue in the car park behind fenwick. There was no accessible loo which was very unfortunate for such a lovely cafe but I was kindly advised by one of the waitresses there was an accessible loo at marks and spencers which was just next door."
lucys cafe edinburgh,positive,parking for about 4 or 5 cars at door and other  parking to rear.within 5 minutes of bus stops . Toilets fully accessible only drawback is also used for baby changing.
ludlow ecolog cabins ludlow,positive,Hardstanding parking outside cabin. Steep slope down to cabin and parking. 2 miles from train station at Ludlow. Good blue badge parking in Ludlow. Accessible toilet  and hand rail
ludlow ludlow,negative,"There are disabled toilets near to car park by castle, but you need a radar key, what on earth is that, and how do you get one? So not able to get in, tried public toilet for gents, 20 pence to use, and they are just typical run toilets, not impressed. You will have to get out of chair to use."
ludlow ludlow,positive,"There is a car park near to castle, with very limited disabled bays, but pushing wheelchair around was very difficult."
luffness new golf club aberlady,positive,Disabled-friendly toilets at both ends of building. Lots of room. Puts most hotels to shame.
luna rossa renfrew,negative,"If you were determined to undergo humiliation and be treated with contempt you could get there easily enough and park in the next street, but trust me you don't want to "
lunderston bay greenock,positive,The Lunderston Bay footpath is located accross the road from Cardwell garden centre on the road between Gourock and Greenock. There is a car park at the beginning of the footpath with disabled parking spaces available. The car park has quite a few unmarked speed bumps to be aware of especially for wheelchair users.
lupe pintos deli edinburgh,positive,"What’s really handy and informative on the website is parking availability informing you of permitted waiting times, bus lane operations. Edinburgh’s bus services on this main route heading south and north respectively is 10, 11, 15, 16, 23, 27, 36 and 45 the southbound stop is right out side the shop, the northbound the other side of the road with a pedestrian crossing 40 m away. There is ample and suitable parking."
lush inverness,negative,The shop is on the High Street in the town centre within a pedestrianised zone so there is no parking on site. There are disabled bays within the town centre but it is difficult to get a spot there. There are also car parks within a nearby shopping centre and in and around the town centre itself.  
lyme disley,positive,We asked the car park attendant who was taking payment where we should park as we didn't have a blue badge but did have a wheelchair user. We were told to go to the orangery wheelchair carpark where a member of staff was waiting to greet us. He was very patient while I got out of the car and into the chair. He then took us through a side gate and into the rose garden. He asked whether we would like to go into the house and then took us to an accessible entrance where we were greeted by another member of staff. 
lyneal trust ellesmere,negative,Not great access especially for power wheelchair users but from a personal point of view I do not require accessible toilets 
lyneal trust ellesmere,positive,The Venue is a long way out in the countryside and and we were glad we had used the toilet before we arrived. The car park and access to the boat were perfectly ok for a wheelchair The toilet and wet room were easily accessible though maybe not enough grab rails. I felt safe using the toilet and wet room Easy parking in their car park opposite their Boat wharf
lyneal trust lyneal,negative,"Is in the shower room and difficult to put powerchair in, easy for manual wheelchair and doors open outwards . Toilet has a lid."
lyneal trust lyneal,positive,You can park next to the Chalets to off load and then park in an adjacent carpark across the road The disabled parking was very good as I have a Mercedes sprinter with electric lift on the back and it worked very well. Looked in the loo looked very good easy access inside one of the cottages
lyric theatre london,negative,We used a black cab which was to the door  & London buses are accessible. Don't know about parking.
mac birmingham,positive,"Several disabled parking spaces close to the entrance Space for 1 manual chair and 2 carers, bars, hygenic"
maccabi youth and sports centre giffnock,negative,Plenty of spots and there is a local bus that brings them to the centre It was fairly easy to find but far away from the main rooms
macdonald burlington hotel birmingham,negative,Parking available but we did not use it 
macdonald burlington hotel birmingham,positive,All as expected
macdonald highland hotel aviemore,negative,Plenty of room for a wheelchair and grab handles. The let down was the shower over the bath which was unable to use. No wet room
macdonald highland hotel aviemore,positive,Plenty of disabled parking there are three disabled parking spaces close to the entrance. access is up a gentle slope  & the doors open automatically. the changing room has a fixed bench. shower & toilet with grab rails not to mention posh soap & lotion free of charge
macdonald lochanhully woodland club carrbridge,positive,"You can park right next to your lodge and the reception, swimming pool and Jake's Bar and Restaurant are all minutes away from the lodges. You should be able to use the loo in your lodge without a problem."
macdonald marine hotel spa north berwick,negative,"North Berwick is well served by trains, though the train station is not particularly nearby and up a steep hill from the hotel and spa. There is disabled parking outside the hotel, but not for the spa - you would need to park outside the hotel and go around the corner to the entrance for the spa. Staff were extremely helpful."
mackenzies farm shop and cafe shetland,positive,"Lots of parking, and two marked disabled bays but they were round the corner from the entrance, could have been a little closer. Great facility, and very clean with nothing being stored in there. I drove to the farm shop and parked in one of the two accessible bays. The bays were obvious on arrival and had lowered kerbs at those spaces. The accessible toilet was great and I managed to leave my first Euan's Guide red cord card here. It had everything I needed to use it safely."
mackinnon mills coatbridge,negative,The disabled toilet is located next to the main toilets in the venue you go through a door that opens outward to find 3 doors ladies gents and the disabled access toilet which is to the far right as you go through the first door. Again the door opens out the way however some people might find this a problem due to the lack of space.  The accessible toilet was clean and there is an alert cord if you require assistance.
mackintosh at the willow glasgow,positive,We had parked in a nearby car park so do not know about roadside parking. Sauchiehall Street is one of the The accessible toilet is in the basement but is easy to get to via  lift. The toilet is big enough to easily manoeuvre a wheelchair. There are plenty of grab rails and a suitable emergency cord. They were clean and tidy. Lots of on street and other parking in city centre and close to bus routes.  Best disabled parking is on nearby Cambridge Street New facility so no issues.  Clean and ample space to manoeuvre.   Toilets are on basement level accessed by lift
macleans highland bakery forres,positive,There is ample off street parking with disabled bays adjacent to the High Street. 
macquarie street sydney,negative,The rating is two star as there could be more parking bays for the disabled near attractions like the Art Gallery of NSW. We can park on the street free with an Australian disability parking permit but check your permit is recognized if it's from outside Australia before parking as fines are steep. Trains take visitors to Circular Quay - there is a lift up to the Cahill Expressway which allows a downhill descent to Macquarie Street. Buses are generally accessible into the CBD but the geography of Sydney means there are hills/ slopes to navigate. All the accessible buildings have accessible toilets. Circular Quay has accessible public toilets.
macrobert arts centre stirling,negative,They only have 2 disabled parking spaces outside the building and they are not monitored very well as blue badge holders are not always parked in them.
macrobert arts centre stirling,positive,"3 disabled spaces at front door, one across the road and several at top carpark. Buses also stop at front door. 2 disabled toilets that im aware of, they have plenty of room to move around and have pull cords, only one criticism they are behind screens and not easy to spot. There are 2 accessible loos. I think if it was your first time here it would hard to find them as they are behind a curved notice board. They are the same inside but in reverse so the hand rail on right is on the left in the other toilet. The soap dispenser and toilet roll holder and hand dryer are in way of the hand rail so you bash your head off them. The toilets are sometimes clean."
macron stadium bolton,negative,"Toilet facilities in the ground are terrible. For a start there is only one, then there is a steep lip to get in and it is only just big enough to close the door it's that cramped. It is nearly impossible for transferring on to the toilet and what's more the cleaning equipment was dumped in there. If it's the same for home supporters I feel sorry for Bolton fans, it's not acceptable. As previously stated, you have to go up non dropped kerbs and in a car park of hundreds of spaces only a few are accessible. Nor are they any wider than standard spaces."
macron stadium bolton,positive,"There are 4 different car parks at Bolton and the away parking had numerous blue badge spaces (unfortunately costing £7 for travelling fans). If that's anything to go by the other car parks at the ground will be great for disabled fans, apart from the price!"
mad bread las palmas de gran canaria,positive,The café is on the pedestrianised walk way adjacent to the beach front. There are buses that stop near by. One step at entrance to café and then disabled accessible toilet is on the ground floor. The room was large and clean. The toilet had grab rails. No emergency alarm.
madame tussauds blackpool,negative,If arriving by Blackpool Tram access is good as the stop is right outside the door. Other modes of transport might be more challenging although there is a car park with accessible parking bays around the back; approximately 300 metres.
madame tussauds blackpool,positive,There was a large accessible loo on the first level with access via a RADAR key.
madame tussauds london,positive,Got here by taxi and home by bus - both worked very well. There was more than one toilet. The one we used had plenty of room for a carer. If you needed to do a full sideways transfer our wheelchair user said it would be a bit tight for a transfer. All clean and tidy. 
madami 2   moms vietnamese kitchen berlin,negative,on a street so could get a car/to the door. Parking possibly a bit of a problem
made in italy edinburgh,positive,There  is on street parking in the Grassmarket a few meters  from the door but it can get very busy.  Lothian buses have an accessible service that runs along the main road; as do some of the accessible tourist buses.
made in ullapool ullapool,negative,"There is limited parking available, disabled badge holders are able to park on the yellow lines on the road directly outside the shop or in one of the few designated MIU parking spaces that are located at the top of the ferry terminal car park. "
madeira botanical garden santa maria maiorfunchal,negative,Had to park down the hill  Not brilliant 
maggie dicksons edinburgh,negative,Will be very difficult parking with its city centre location. There is public transport that passes the door.
magic kingdom park orlando,positive,"Brilliant, absolutely accessible and friendly Well located and labeled on maps and signs and spotlessly clean"
magma manchester,positive,"I don't know about parking, but walking there was easy in Northern Quarter. There is lots of public transport nearby."
magpie cafe whitby,positive,"Disabled parking is available on street via Blus Badge. Very busy in summer. Disabled parking is available outside the Magpie. The only snag is that the steps leading to the restaurant front door prevent a wheelchair user from passing from the town centre side to get to the lift. So to find a dropped kerb proceed along the road, which is pedestrians only during the day,  past the Magpie entrance, use the dropped kerb outside the arcade and return to the take away. I side the take away is the lift. The toilet is easily reached using the lift. It was clean and had room enough for me to transfer over.  We were on level 2 where the accessible toilet was so clean and well-equipped. The doors open automatically at the push of a button. The only reason it doesn't get a perfect score is because the mirror is at a standing height rather than being full length."
maid of the forth south queensferry,negative,You have to step over a threshold. Not wheelchair accessible.
maid of the forth south queensferry,positive,The are 3 disabled parking spaces outside the Maid of the Forth ticket office
main street bakery callander,positive,"There is on street car parking directly in front of the bakers and more parking just around the corner. On busy days, it might be difficult to get parked here, but there is a pay and display car park in the area which is free for blue badge holders. "
mainsgill farm shop richmond,positive,Standard disabled toilet.
maison bleue at home edinburgh,positive,"easily accessible by Lothian buses,  but on-street parking only clean, roomy and accessible"
maison de larchitecture de poitou charentes poitiers,negative,There are lots of on-street disabled spaces in the town centre which is just a short walk away.  There are also buses to the town centre but I don't know if they're accessible and there is a train station but it is a fair uphill walk up from it; I think you could get the bus up though if it was accessible.
maison des landes hotel st ouens,positive,These are very good. Some public toilets on the island will require a RADAR key. Tourists are offered a choice of places to visit and the buses/drivers are very good. Own vehicle parking can be a problem around St Helier. All rooms we saw had en suite. Access to the toiled bowl for self catheterisation needed careful negotiation.
maitreya social bristol,negative,The restaurant is located on St Marks Road which is a busy inner city street. There is no off street parking however there are a number of disabled bays on St Marks Road itself. The disabled friendly toilet is at the end of the restaurant. When I visited the staff had left the spare chairs stacked up in front of the disabled friendly door. We moved the chairs so it was dealt with.  The toilet is large enough to handle a power chair although I use a manual wheelchair.
majestic tea room inverkeithing,positive,"The cafe is serviced by the railway station buses that are frequent and accessible. There is a private car park with two blue badge spaces. It is less than 4 yards to the door then another 4 yards into the cafe that is situated within the antiques Centre.  Super spacious toilet, lots of circulation and left hand transfer space. A star knocked off as there is no alarm and being down a corridor through two doors it is needed. "
majestic wine edinburgh,positive,"Parking spaces right outside, although there are no designated accessible parking spaces so it could be hard to make sure there is enough space either side if you need it. The 42 bus goes along Causewayside or there are lots more options on Newington Road. "
malham national park centre malham,negative,"Designated parking at the Visitor Centre in Malham. Then travel about ten plus minutes along the road to get to the start of the route. There are quite a lot of cars passing but not too fast as it's a small lane. Just need to take care. Plenty of bluen  badge spaces. Fee payable. Loo at Visitor Centre. Didn't use it. There was a separate accessible one, near the blue badge spaces."
malham national park centre malham,positive,"There are four marked blue badge spaces in the car park, each with hatchings on both sides. The path from the car park to the visitor centre is good. Parking was very busy, with many people creating spaces that didn't exist but we didn't have a problem getting a blue badge space. In summer though, more than four might be needed. There is an accessible toilet with RADAR lock at the visitor centre. It was clean, well stocked and had enough room for me and my mountain trike. The doorway was a little narrower than I'd like and the hand-dryer was pretty lame. It was one the better toilets I've found in busy tourist spots."
malham tarn settle,negative,"At Watersinks there's a formal car park - gravel, smallish and no blue badge spaces. The surface is uneven and you'll have to pick your spot to transition from car park to path - there's a sizeable step most of the way round but it's more level, if a little uneven, in some places. Further along the road (drive on with Watersinks on the left) there's an informal parking area which I believe leads to the same gravel track.  However we used Watersinks successfully. There's a public loo in outbuildings by Tarn House. I didn't use it as a group of ramblers arrived and were waiting to use it! So I've no idea what it was like and how suitable it is."
malin head ardmalin,positive,"There's an adequate car park with a couple of blue badge spaces. From there you go a short way up a steep tarmac road to get to the top viewpoint. My scooter coped fine with this, but if your scooter or wheelchair wouldn't, there's room for someone to drive you up and drop you off at the top. "
malleny garden balerno,positive,"On-site parking a short wheel/walk from the garden. Regular service Lothian Buses 44 and 44A from the centre of Edinburgh via Dalry, Shandon, Slateford, Juniper Green & Currie. The bus stop is close to the driveway that leads to the garden. It is approximately a quarter of a mile from the bus stop to the accessible entrance to the garden."
mallory court country house hotel spa leamington spa,negative,"Sadly, the car park is a short distance away from hotel, and although disabled bays are available, it is a bit of a push away for your carer. However, the prompt attention of valet to be ready for you by having a ramp in place to get you into the hotel will more than please you. Remember, the driver may stop right outside the hotel entrance to drop you off, before they return to car park. We did not find a public disabled toilet, and although public toilet was quite an experience, it is not disabled friendly, you would not get a chair in there, so you will need to be able to stand and walk in by yourself. There are grab rails to help you then. The car park for this house is at the far end of main car park area, not to far for carer to get you there, with pleasant ride passing gardens. No disabled toilet in public areas, but a very posh ladies or gents is available, but you will not get a chair inside without effort, so bear this in mind. They are spotlessly clean however."
mallory court country house hotel spa leamington spa,positive,"A delightful countryside drive will bring you to Mallory Court, and within a few feet you need to turn right for the car park itself ( many will drive past it before realising )  as a passenger, or to download suitcases, drive first of all up to the entrance of hotel, and for you their disabled guest a ramp will be placed to escort you into this lovely old hotel."
malmaison dundee,negative,The hotel does not have any of its own parking.  We were lucky as there is a loading bay directly outside the hotel which was permitted for the duration of our stay
malmaison dundee,positive,"Arrived from station which is a only short 5-10 min journey with dropped kerbs all the way. There is parking nearby but we didn't use it so unsure if Blue Badge parking spaces. Good disabled loos convenient for each area. Can’t comment on parking, as we arrived by train. The hotel is within sight of the station. Getting there involves crossing some busy roads, but there are pedestrian crossings and using them we discovered that Dundee believes in making drop-downs smooth & easy to negotiate. We think a delegation from City of Edinburgh Council should check this out and learn how it’s done. We didn’t check out the accessible loo on the landing near the Brasserie. The one in our en-suite bathroom was well-equipped with grab rails and not too high. There was adequate space to manoeuvre and an adjacent accessible wash hand basin at a sensible level for a wheelchair user. Dropped off by taxi immediately outside. Large enough for carer wheelchair turning.  Clean and tidy with grab rails.  Unfortunately, due to the layout of the room, the toilet-roll holder is not easily accessed. We had an accessible room, where the bathroom facilities were excellent - wetroom, grab rails, folding shower seat, low level wash basin, etc."
malt kiln farm shop rugby,positive,"We drove, as it is a countryside location (I doubt there is any public transport to such an area).  There were disabled parking spaces right by the front entrance, properly marked on both sides for full access.  Getting to the entrance was easy as the short roll to the door was nice & level, and the surface indoors was what us wheelies love - perfectly smooth and and very easy to traverse. "
maltsters llandaff cardiff,positive,Has its own car park. Fine for powered chair
malvern hills hotel malvern,negative,"Although many bays, no disabled though, it’s a bit narrow for easy parking, and on a sideways slope. The disabled toilet lies along a level corridor, but it’s a bit tight in there, you may just about spin your chair and carer would struggle to help you in there. But it does have grab rails and pull cord."
malvern museum malvern,negative,Street parking only around this museum.
manaros aberdaron,positive,Would need own transport but parking  immediately outside accommodation. National Trust car park in the village.
manchester academy manchester,positive,"Driving from Liverpool was so easy, and the car park for the venue is located literally just around the corner!!  The car park has 4 designated disabled bays, and the barrier opens with a fee of just £2.00 !! Being situated on busy Oxford Road, there's also a bus stop right outside too! There's also an Oxford Rd train station a 10 minute walk away which is accessible from the main Victoria station. Clean & tidy accessible toilets that had fold up grab rails are available on all levels. The actual toilet pan is of standard height, not raised. Plenty of room for wheelchair and/or assistant."
manchester airport manchester,positive,"From Waverley Station straight to Manchester Airport there were no issues, the Trans Pennine Service had ample Disabled Access seating, close to a well appointed toilet. Living in Edinburgh we had no parking issues at the Station. All the Disabled toilets were spacious fully appointed and could be accessed with a Radar Key. There was more than enough room for any sized wheelchair or power scooter and carer. There were numerous disabled toilets. Edinburgh by train............Manchester Airport, no problems there and back."
manchester arena manchester,negative,"Manchester Arena have an accessibility toilet in every main toilet section for both men and women. There are also a number of larger toilets that are operated by Radar key. The toilets were relatively close to where we were sat. However I found the the accessible toilet was open to abuse due to their only being 3 cubicles within the Mens toilets and when I went to use it towards the end of the night, I found that the baby change table had been opened, the Red Cord had been pulled around the toilet flush handle and toilet roll had been left on the floor making it difficult to walk around due to the floor also being wet.  Gross.  Very small, and strange triangular shaped room.  If changing your little one on a dirty floor isn't bad enough, having to leave their chair outside and worrying about it being stolen makes it worse :("
manchester arena manchester,positive,"We drove and parked up on a street about 10 minutes walk from the entrance to the Arena, however there is a car park attached to the arena and Metrolink Trams run into Victoria station which is right next door to the Arena. See the above (but be sure to book in advance). Here's a link to the NCP web site for more info -  https://www.ncp.co.uk/find-a-car-park/car-parks/manchester-arena-jv/ Lots of transport links/options for people to get into the city centre the nearest tram stop to the arena is Victoria.  Accessible toilets can be found through the venue and can be access with a radar key. If  disabled customers don’t have their own radar key they can ask staff for assistance. The disabled toilets however are very small and can’t fit both wheelchair user and thier career in. "
manchester piccadilly train station manchester,negative,"There are car parks on the Fairfield side entrance and Store Street. These are through barriers and the former involves multiple speed bumps and 2 awkward turns which can cause problems for people with physical disabilities. There is accessible parking but it is not especially near to the station at either side and at Fairfield is often blocked by private hire vehicles dropping off people without disabilities by parking across 2 spaces. Taxi drivers also make the crossing point from the station to the Fairfield car park difficult. Both car parks cost unless you're there less than 20 mins. Drop off here is a nightmare if you're a wheelchair user as there isn't enough space in the drop off area. Getting a black cab from the rank is a physical impossibility as some idiot designed the rank to have a dropped kerb which simply does not work with the ramps on the hackney carriages. You end up meeting the cab driver around the corner, not fun when you're tired from traveling. It simply should not be that hard. I shan't repeat myself here but the situation is shambolic and puts disabled people at risk of wetting themselves. Simply not enough provision."
manchester piccadilly train station manchester,positive,"I arrived to the station by train and then walked. There was a very full taxi section where there were also disabled parking bays available.   The nearest bus station is in Piccadilly Gardens. Toilet in main entrance was clean and accessed using a radar key. There was enough space to turn around. The grab rails and toilet seat were of a contrasting colour. There were rails on the door, around toilet and around sink.   There was also a toilet up in the waiting area for platform 13/14.   I didn't see any signs saying there was a changing places toilet. "
manchester tennis and football centre manchester,negative,There were 2 disabled toilets and changing areas/showers were included in the main changing room.  These were all easy to find and there were grab rails. There were no hoists.
manchester tennis and football centre manchester,positive,This centre is next to the Ethiad so has good transport links with the tram. We came by minibus and there were disabled spaces right by the entrance
manchester town hall manchester,positive,"There are no toilet facilities for visitors in the Town Hall, except for wheelchair accessible toilets. However, on Lloyd Street is a public toilet with a Changing Places toilet with full facilities cords. This needs a RADAR key to access.  In addition are good clean disabled toilets, with grab rails, alarm cord, raised toilet and wheelchair height washbasin as well as good, clean ordinary male/female toilets. All free! Our guide warned us of all of this before our visit, so we came prepared. One of our number needed to use the disabled facilities in the Town Hall and this was accessed quickly."
manchurian restaurant dundee,negative,Disabled toilets are accessible once chairs  moved as the corridor to accessible toilet doubles as a storage area 
manchurian restaurant dundee,positive,Never used carpark but I think there is a space for blue badge holder and there is a car park close to restaurant.  Parking at the front where the adjoining Chinese supermarket has a car park.  Usually room to park. Easy access
mannerstons cafe farm shop linlithgow,positive,Couldn't see any specific disabled parking bays and the ground can be rough for rollators/walking sticks but we managed to park close to a small paved area at the door so no issues.
mannheim hauptbahnhof railway station mannheim,negative,"There are accessible toilets around the city centre, and in the train station, that are accessible with a 'EuroKey'. Many shops also provide accessible toilets but of course these are only available during open hours and nearly all shops in Mannheim are closed on Sundays! Not all toilets were as clean as expected, and some shops still employ staff that expect a tip before you enter the toilet."
mannheim hauptbahnhof railway station mannheim,positive,The nearest tram links are just opposite the train station. Tram stops and platforms have recently been modified to ensure disabled access is provided at the majority of stops on each line. Access the city-map online and check-out parking locations: https://www.gis-mannheim.de/mannheim/#  Deutsche Bahn also have a dedicated webpage and contact numbers for people who may require assistance: https://www.bahn.de/p/view/service/barrierefrei/barrierefreies_reisen_handicap.shtml
manningtree railway station manningtree,positive,"There are only four accessible parking spaces, but you have to be registered with GAparking so that you are not charged, i must admit when i first used this a couple of weeks ago it filled me with dread, but you have 24 hours to register,, with your blue badge, and you have to scan this so if you have the facility to scan or take a photo on your phone. I did question this as discrimination through the back door. Superb and fantastic someone has listened at long last."
manns of cranleigh cranleigh,negative,"Parking on the high st is limited though there are three bays right outside, one of which is disabled. Manns have a car park at the rear but now keep it locked. They will open it on request but the logistics of that are tricky if you're disabled! There are two public car parks within a few minutes wheel/push."
manns of cranleigh cranleigh,positive,"The loo is lovely and because it's not the only loo, seems not to be abused.  However the siting is a bit awkward as the able bodied loo is right next door to it, with a door that opens straight onto the door of the assisted loo - see the photo - so care is needed if you're going into the disabled loo that someone doesn't exit the other loo and inadvertently bowl you over! Careless design! I would have awarded five stars had it not been for this."
manor house and ashbury hotel okehampton,positive,"Only really accessible by car. Plenty of onsite parking though sometimes difficult to park near reception on arrival (not obviously signed from the car park) Once booked in, Having prebooked a mobility scooter, and disabled room, by sending a copy of my wife’s blue badge, we had a reserved parking space close to our ground floor room. It’s a big site but navigable by wheelchair and mobility scooter - even indoors (but see below) There were adequate spacious well equipped easy access/disabled loos across the site. In our room (144) the toilet itself was low (standard toilet, not heightened) and there was no horizontal grab bar to assist rising. Arrived by car, able to park close to our room  Fab disabled toilet and wet room in my room, good toilets around site too"
manor west retail park tralee,positive,The accessible toilet is on the ground floor of the main building and is signposted.
manx museum douglas,positive,"disabled toliets available for all and also has a changing places toliet with hoist and comfy changing bed. lots of room for wheelchair, carer and assistance dog."
maple tree guest house gretna,positive,Parking to rear of property Spacious bathroom with shower easily used by someone using a walking stick. Shower has a seat. Grab rail by toilet.
maplin london,negative,"Lots of buses go past on Edgware Road but there are no step-free stations nearby. I wouldn't dream of parking in this area. Plenty of buses in the Strand, but a pitiful shortage of step-free tube stations. Waterloo is just on the other side of Waterloo Bridge, Green Park is over a mile away."
mar y sol spa sport hotel marbella,positive,"Travelling in to and out of Tenerife airport we were met by a dedicated airport staff member who facilitated our total journey from plane to transport and the reverse, pushing the manual wheelchair. Our transport was via LERO wheelchair accessible coach (which is based at Mar y Sol Hotel but available to anyone) again the driver loaded both cases and our wheelchair from the arrivals lounge in to the hotel. The accessible coach is also available for  taxi services or for days out to popular venues carrying disabled and able bodies guests. On booking at Marysol a choice of toilet chair suitable to individual needs is available within the price and photos are also available to help make the choice. The LERO facility on site also offers the hire of electric or manual hoists. Personal helpers and trained medical staff are also available for hire should guests need specific help with personal care, even if managing very serious disabilities."
marble hill strand dunfanaghy,negative,"Parking was fine at the Shandon hotel, but very busy down near the beach. Didn't matter too much though once we'd made it down the secret sandy road and left the car there. I didn't spot any loos down at the beach itself, but there was a lovely clean spacious accessible loo up at the Shandon Hotel."
marcos pool hall pizza bar edinburgh,negative,"Its on a one-way street, which can get quite busy. There is a place for taxis to pull in and drop people off. We didn't use it, but there was one, it was clean."
mareel shetland,positive,"We walked here about a 10 minute from the ferry terminal. But there's a large car park out at the front. I saw a sign for an accessible loo at the bar - but couldn't find one. I found a large, clean one out at the lobby, which isn't too far away from the bar."
mariachi edinburgh,positive,Good disabled toilet. Large. 
marine house lymington,negative,See comments about bathroom. The toilet had no disabled grab rails.
marine house lymington,positive,"There is a council run car park next to Marine House. One disabled space. The owner has an agreement with the council that residents can use the car park free of charge. The disabled space us marked, wide and paved.  The rest of the car park is gravel - which might prove a challenge for wheelchairs and some scooters.   From the car park to the hotel entrance is maybe 50m   There is double yellow lines outside the hotel. So on with a blue badge?"
market bar dublin,positive,Good toilet but you have to ask for the key at the bar
market drayton market drayton,negative,"Following a drab countryside ride  through this part of Shropshire, and arriving at this typical run down town centre, we pulled into a big enough car park, with just a few disabled bays, but not a nice safe carpark, far to many holes and bumps to get past to reach centre."
market place toilets ilkeston,positive,There are two pay and display car parks to the town centre. Pimlico Street car park is closest with free parking for badge holders in designated bays.   If you need to access mobility equipment shopmobility is located  close to Erewash Museum and there is a car park for members. It is only open Thursday and Saturday (9am to 2:30pm). There is a form to complete to become a member.  Bus stops are either up or down a hill.  These are public loos. The door is locked with a radar key (make sure door closes behind you otherwise it won't lock and is vulnerable to vandals). The door may be awkward to open for some as it has a self closing hinge. Toilet is combined with baby changing but is spacious with enough room for wheelchair and 2 people. Toilet is left sided transfer and there are rails (white) around toilet and sink. There is no emergency alarm due to it being public with no staff present. There was no bag hook and mirror wasn't too high. 
marks and spencer edinburgh,positive,"There is lots of parking at Fort Kinnaird, although it can get very busy. There are designed accessible spaces near shop entrances. There are bus stops at Fort Kinnaird, Lothian 30, 49, 106 and 400 stop there. 108 and 118 Prentice Coaches also stop there.  The accessible toilet was a good size with a cord at the correct length. There is a bin in the transfer area but it is quite narrow against the wall. Another larger bin is next to it. I have not visited it but I did hear that there is a Changing Places toilet at Fort Kinnaird between Currys PC World and the Odeon. "
marks and spencer ilkeston,negative,The parking spaces are small and awkward to get into. They have 3 at entrance. The bays only have 1 side marked. My issue was the only bay had left side marked and bollards. I use a hoist so I need the right side marked as I can only forward in.  For some reason in some parts they have two disabled bays and one regular bay. They'd have been better off making two large disabled bays.
marks and spencer scunthorpe,positive,Large car park with plenty of blue badge spaces with hatchings between and behind. Parking is free. Level entry from car park into store.
marks deli giffnock,negative,"On Street parking with  a single yellow line, but pretty limited space"
marks hall gardens and arboretum coggeshall,positive,"There are plenty of blue badge parking spaces in the car park, and they are a stones throw away from the visitors centre and the park itself. The parking area is gravel, making it slightly challenging for wheelchair users, but the parking spaces are so close to the visitors centre that you're not on the gravel for long."
marks spencer cafe inverness,positive,Lots of parking in the Eastgate shopping centre car park. Large accessible loo.
marks spencer cafe lincoln,negative,"Good size decent toilet, hidden in the men's section by the shorts not actually in the cafe. Right sided for wheelchair user transfers.  Sloping roof could cause difficulties for tall people"
marks spencer dumfries,positive,"I used a wheelchair taxi service to visit, which dropped me off at the flatter access on the pedestrianised High street. There is a Parking Area to the rear of the store on the lower floor, with  one designated accessible parking space, and about 5 narrow parking spaces, which are always in great demand. There are parking spaces in the street to the rear entrance on the lower floor. There is a bus stop at the  opposite end of the shopping centre , and a few seats allocated throughout the centre to rest, to access the store from the shopping centre. There is a large carpark below the shopping centre , with a few accessible spaces Situated at the back of the Foodhall, poor signage. Reasonably clean and fresh, plenty of room, plenty of grab rails etc in place, and an assistance cord in place."
marks spencer edinburgh,negative,"Although there are blue badge spaces near the store, these are far to few in number and the majority of the time I have been unable to park there Yes there is an accessibility loo, however you need to know where to look for the toilets on the first floor, and need to negotiate the display units to get there. Due to the fact it's in the city centre parking can be an issue. However blue badge users can park on George Street if there are any spaces available. Also there are plenty of bus and tram stop close by. There is also plenty of taxis ranks in the vicinity."
marks spencer edinburgh,positive,"Close by bus stops and has a car park in front of it, which had 6 blue badge spaces available. Large dedicated disabled toilets that has everything you would need and was nice and clean. There's one disabled parking space beside the store. However, there are more beside New Look and Homebase and its only a short stretch from those stores to the M&S along the pavement.  The 38 and 42 bus routes stop at the Sainsburys, which is 5 mins walk away. Parking was available just outside the door in dedicated blue badge bays. There's also a handy bus stop by the main entrance to the centre. The tram service also has a stop at the Gyle but it is some distance away from the store. There are several accessible toilets in the store. The one I visited was spotlessly clean, had plenty of grab rails and ample room to move around. Also, room for a carer / PA if required. Parking on the spot and regular bus services to and from the city centre,  also the Lothian no. 38 to and from Balgreen, the south side and the Royal Infirmary in one direction and Crewe Toll and Granton in the other (but no longer at weekends, for some reason). Only falls short of a 5 because you have to negotiate a couple of heavy doors to get in. Once in, the accessible toilet is 5 star. We took the tram. Very accessible and comfortable Large disabled toilets available on the Rose Street level and also down on the food court level."
marks spencer epsom,positive,"Epsom Station is nearby, fully step-free, equipped with ramps, friendly staff. There's a large car-park nearby too.  I used only the accessible toilet attached to the 1st-floor café. Very good, except that the soap and paper-towel dispensers are placed much too high up for most wheelchair users. "
marks spencer falkirk,positive,Very good apart from the havy fire doors
marks spencer glasgow,positive,first class adequate
marks spencer harrogate,positive,"There are designated disabled parking spaces situated directly outside the building.  Next to the parking is a trolley bay which is accessible by wheelchair and provides wheelchair trolleys that attach for convenience. There is a bus stop outside the building on the Leeds Road, a regular service (No 36 stops here), there is a pedestrian access from the bus stop leading to the building, this is also wide enough for wheelchairs to access. A spacious disabled toilet can be accessed in the main Foodhall shopping area a short distance from the café, signposted clearly.  It has adequate space for carers and wheelchairs, it was very clean and tidy and well stocked. The facility had grab rails around the toilet (one drop down rail on the right side) and sink area, a pull cord for assistance if required was clearly visible to the left of the toilet.  The low sink enabled easy access with lever action taps for ease of use."
marks spencer hereford,negative,Sited in a pedestrian area.
marks spencer hertford,negative,Blue badge spaces but all taken
marks spencer kirkcaldy,negative,"car park is large but not spacious. its a shopping centre car park and really difficult to navigate. the spaces for disabled are too narrow and its hard to find the entrance from the car park to shopping mall good accessible, clean toilets just getting to them through clothes rails and signs being difficult to find letting them down a bit"
marks spencer london,negative,"The nearest step-free station is Earls Court, which is a long way off. Many buses go up and down Kensington High Street. I wouldn't dream of trying to park here. There is an accessible toilet but it was annoyingly disappointing. Rubbish bins were cluttering up the wheelchair transfer area, which is NOT free space for bins! Worse still, the red emergency cord had been tied up, drastically shortened, and tucked out of the way (see my pictures). This cord should always hang freely all the way to the floor. Very annoying - and putting people's safety at risk. There are no step-free stations nearby. Several bus routes run up and down Moorgate and stop very near the shop. The nearest tube station is Sloane Square, which is not step-free, but does have escalators from the westbound (but NOT the eastbound) platform to street level, so if you can get out of your wheelchair and take it up an escalator, this station may be an option. Loads of buses go along the King's Road. I wouldn't attempt to park nearby."
marks spencer london,positive,There is an accessible toilet in the basement. It is very hard to find. It has all the correct features. One star lost because the emergency cord dangles among some loose-hanging mains earth-leads. It would be easy to pull the wrong thing in an emergency. This seems to me a very dangerous and silly arrangement. See my photo below. There was an accessible loo on the floor I visited and it was easy to get in and spacious.
marks spencer outlet edinburgh,positive,Parking was easy as there are disabled bays immediately outside of the store. If arriving by bus it is a significant distance from the store to the bus stop and requires you to go up a fairly lengthy ramp or take the long route around via the access road.
marks spencer pudsey,positive,"New Pudsey Train station approximately 5 minutes away.  There is a flat path all the way from the station to the store.  This can get narrow in parts (see picture below).  There is lighting for nights however, you do come along the railway line and there is lots of vegetation on your other side so may not be a good idea alone and in the dark!  Lots of car parking spaces immediately outside Marks and Spencers.  Approximately 40 disabled bays which are located in front of all 3 entrances.  There are 2 disabled toilet cubicles on the lower ground floor only.  These are configured as ordinary wheelchair-accessible toilets.  Large rooms with no obstacles.  No nappy changing facilities in these toilets!  There are also a few larger cubicles available in the main toilet blocks with numerous grab rails which may suit some people (see picture below).  One slightly lower than normal hand dryer available here too.  Emergency cords looked in working order and there was also an emergency button.  Shame there are no toilets on the ground floor "
marks spencer redhill,positive,"Dedicated Blue Badge spaces near lifts and Shopmobility office.  Most bus services have ramps. Redhill train station has lifts to all platforms.  All crossing nearby, and towards bus and train stations, have dipped kerbs and tactile paving. "
marks spencer sheffield,positive,Blue badge holders can park on the street behind M&S (Norfolk Street) but you must go to the front of the shop to enter. The area in front of the shop (Fargate) is pedestrianised but mostly cobbled. Bus and tram stops are no more than 2 minutes away. The toilet is a good size and well maintained.
marks spencer simply food coatbridge,negative,The retail park has a large car park and there is some Blue badge spaces available at the front of this store however these to fill up very quickly at times. The nearest public transport is the bus stops out on South Circular Road from this store this is a good 10mins walking. you can get bus to local Coatbridge areas as well as buses to other towns in Lanarkshire and Glasgow from these stops.
marks spencer simply food perth,positive,Immediately outside Immaculate and new
marks spencer york,negative,M+S in the middle of town but is adjacent to main road therefore drop off points there but no room for nearby parking none present down stairs. disabled toilet on top floor is relatively accessible. There is no parking specifically for this store however there are bus stops just along from the store and vehicles are able to pull up outside for easy access to and from transport.
marks spencer york,positive,There are three disabled toilets within this store. All are spacious and have appropriate equipment within them including rails and an alarm system. Whilst in store this alarm system was activated and the first aid staff responded quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately the toilets are located on the top (3rd) floor. There are lifts to get to this floor however which are spacious also. 
markthal rotterdam,positive,"The Markthal can be accessed by public transportation.  If going by car, there is a wheelchair accessible parking lot located under the building.  From the Rotterdam Centraal Station, it is a 25 minute walk.  If going by taxi, the company Accessible Travel Netherlands can make arrangements for you. An accessible toilet is located on floor -1"
marlborough hotel shanklin,negative,"It had a wet room, but it was about half a foot lower than the bedroom, which meant that whilst it was easy to go into the toilet. It was very difficult to get out unless you are strong and my partner had to pull me out every time because I was not strong enough to get up the very steep threshold ramp"
marlow rowing club marlow,positive,MRC is accessed via road and has it's own small tarmac car park. There is one disabled space next to the main front door.  There is a toilet and an accessible shower room. The toilet is arge and easy to manouver in. There are plenty of grab rails. For those needing more space there is a larger shower room available. The room has an accessible shower and toilet. The toilets are easy to find and clearly signposted. 
marlowe theatre canterbury,negative,There are disabled parking spaces at the front of the theatre but as the theatre is in the city centre and spaces are limited in Canterbury the theatre spaces are often taken by disabled shoppers. There is not even a sign discouraging this so it is often necessary to drop off and drive to find alternative parking and walk back. This is very awkward at the end of the show. Rating 3
marlowe theatre canterbury,positive,Disable toilets are excellent and on all levels. Rating 5
marsham arms norwich,negative,Normal loo in bedroom but there is a good disabled loo in the pub.
marsham arms norwich,positive,"There is good parking very close but te pub is in the countryside and you really need a car, I doubt there is a regular bus service, it is not even in a village but there are lots of things to see not far away."
martin wishart at loch lomond alexandria,negative,Disabled parking next to the leisure club but i chose to park further away to enjoy the walk to the leisure club entrance.Driving here is essential unless you stay close and get a taxi.
martin wishart at loch lomond alexandria,positive,Easy to find and large and well kept as you would assume in a 5 star hotel
martins brugge bruges,positive,"The ensuite bathroom was quite large. The toilet and shower both had grab rails and the shower had two different kinds of seats to choose from.  Like the bedroom, there was no emergency cord. The shelf and the mirror were too high to use, but there was a lower mirror in the bedroom."
marwell zoo winchester,positive,They have a huge car park and there is also buses that visit the zoo from local centres.  Disabled toilets accessed with a radar key and there is a purpose built changing facility.  Parking bays in large cap park 50 yds from main entrance which is as close as you can get. The site has internal several road trains going round the park and one has compartment  that can take wheelchair making it easy to get from one side of the park to the other. On site some conventional disabled toilets but also one very large Changing Places toilet with changing table and full hoist system
mary ward house conference centre london,negative,"This was very problematic. Firstly the accessible toilet is not sign posted. It is in a corridor behind a door marked staff only. One of my own colleague told me off for going into an area marked staff only, see photo. When I went through this door I found that a trolley was blocking the accessible toilet. This happened twice during my stay. When I went into the toilet for the first time there was a stair climber wheelchair, which took up most of the space in the toilet, I was told this was there as it had been used the day before. I explained that the accessible toilet should not be used as a store room.  This was removed before my second loo break. The toilet had grab rails and was clean. The emergency cord didn't reach to the ground. "
mary ward house conference centre london,positive,"Mary Ward is round the corner from Tavistock Square and several buses stop close by. The nearest tube stations are Euston Square, which only has a lift on the East bound platform, Euston and King's Cross which is step free."
maryport promenade maryport,positive,Plenty of parking adjacent to the promenade.
marys kitchen tearoom dundee,negative,"There isn't a wheelchair accessible toilet, the toilet door looked slim and I don't think it would have been big enough for my powerchair, but we didn't check so can't say for sure. It may be suitable for manual wheelchair users"
marys kitchen tearoom dundee,positive,"It's on the Perth Road where there are lots of buses, there is on street parking , and not far from the city centre "
marys milk bar edinburgh,negative,Busy streets. Not much accessible parking available.
marys milk bar edinburgh,positive,On street parking  We got there by car as this is the easiest transport method for us. The parking in the grass market can be a bit of a nightmare and with only 1 disabled bay it’s a flip of the coin as to whether it is free or not. That said there are lots of spaces and they tend to free up on a regular basis as most people are passing through. 
mastersons steakhouse wine bar tallaght,negative,Disabled parking spot 30 seconds away.
mastersons steakhouse wine bar tallaght,positive,To standard.
matalan coatbridge,negative,There are Blue Badge spaces to the left of the main entrance to the store however these can fill up fast during busy periods of time.  The main busy stops are located out on South Circular Road from here you can get local buses as well as services to other parts of Lanarkshire as well as Glasgow. This is a good ten minute walk from this store Toilets are located on the right hand side of the store as you enter the store there is no signage for the toilets You go through a door from the store area to the toilets this opens outwards. The accessible toilet is located to the right as you enter this area it is a good basic accessible toilet with grip rails on both sides. However the cover is missing from the toilet paper holder so if you do go to use paper it rolls and ends up on the floor.
matchsticks cafe bar and bistro salford,positive,Parked on street front although there is a car park at the side of building.  Public transport in adjoining street. There is a door to get into the hall leading to Toilets.  Toilets are separate from each other with their own doors.  Disabled toilet has grab rails and red assistance chord.  The room was clean.
mauritshuis the hague,positive,"There’s a wheelchair accessible loo off the foyer, well signposted. There are grab rails on both sides of the toilet, with space for side transfer and an accessible washbasin. Unusually for a Dutch accessible loo (most have round the room horizontal alarm cords at skirting board height) this loo has two cords which come down from the ceiling and which ideally should be a bit longer. They are sensible positioned."
mayfield garden centre kelso,negative,"There are very few Disabled parking bays for such a new building which is very disappointing. There is a vast car park with lots of parking space for abled bodied people. There is no public transport to the Garden Centre and it is a good 30 minute walk from the bus stop to the actual venue  As I described earlier in the review the toilets were the main problem. There are Disabled parking bays but in my opinion not enough for the size of the actual Garden Centre. There is no public transport to the garden centre and it must be a good 15 to 20 minute walk from the bus stops in Kelso town centre. There is no train station in Kelso. The doors and aisles are very wide to allow wheelchair access but in the actual dining area space is very tight for a walking aid, wheelchair or mobility scooter. There is only one Disabled toilet which is shared by a baby changing facility which is not enough in my opinion as you can`t use the normal toilets as the doors are very narrow."
mayfield restaurant dublin,positive,Nearby parking Large wheelchair accessible bathroom
mayflower restaurant harwich,positive,"Disabled parking is shared with the Premier Innn, as per photo - on top of that there is a large regular car park as well belonging to Lidl Not sure, however the restaurant has it's own toliets at the back"
mayflower theatre southampton,positive,There is a general carpark within a short distance though a bit of a hill. Can park without paying if you have a blue badge.  Bus stops and train station nearby. There is a newly refurbished changing places toilet one side of the stalls and a decent sized accessible loo the other side. Both were clean and well equipped. The Mayflower have no parking but there is a reasonable amount of parking very close to the theatre.  It is on a busy bus route and is just 5 minutes easy walk from Southampton train station.
maynews ltd bristol,negative,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately 200m away on Station Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
mayo county library claremorris,negative,A toilet is available by request from staff. It is clean with a handrail
mays coffee shop bishopton,positive,Car. Large carpark at rear of building. Clean freshly decorated disabled toilet
mbna thames clippers london,positive,The larger vessels also have a separate accessible loo on board which is really good.
mbna thames clippers trinity buoy wharf,negative,"Depending on which way you go to get to the Pier you might have to take the same convoluted route involving lots of cobbles around the Tower of London - it is worth it so do persevere! Also this gave us the chance to see the amazing Field of Poppies currently on display at the Tower. Wasn't one on the older boat, was on the newer one, but we didn't use it. "
mbna thames clippers trinity buoy wharf,positive,"Brilliant toilets, easily accessible. Really should say not applicable as the transport is the boat!"
mcarthurglen designer outlet west midlands cannock,positive,"Huge car park with disabled bays, which are a waste of time anyway, and the whole complex has level walks and entrances intonshops Two different toilet blocks may be found, one is especially useful for disabled although it’s still a bit tight into cubicle, and the other shows that a lift is available to get up to first floor, or use escalator, but there is a small disabled toilet on ground floor behind the lift, it is signposted. (SEE PHOTOS) See part one, taking note not to use disabled bays in section C as steps prevent you getting down to shop level. Use section D instead, it’s right by the main entry for shops. Two toilet complexes you can use, one has a lift to upper level, but a small disabled toilet can be used just behind the lift on the ground floor, as shown on this part of our review.    "
mccolls forres,positive,"There is ample parking off Forres High Street, with disabled bays.  "
mccooleys mathew street liverpool,negative,In busy Cavern Quarter - public transport 5-10 mins walk away
mccooleys mathew street liverpool,positive,Operated by Radar Key. Very clean and spacious inside 
mccowans brewhouse edinburgh,negative,The accessible loo is on the smaller side and is clearly old. The lock is a bit iffy so take care if going alone. The red cord is short but I have reported this. Handrails were in a good position for me and I was able to transfer from my powerchair with ease and then turn to exit easily. 
mccowans brewhouse edinburgh,positive,Buses stop right outside and there is a car parking facility underground.
mccoys bar new york,positive,Very central with good transport links.
mcdiarmid park perth,positive,"The stadium is on the western edge of Perth and is easily accessible from both the city bypass and surrounding streets. A few disabled spaces outside the west stand. We travelled by car. As away supporters our home club could not provide us with a car parking space. I phoned St Johnstone very late (the day before the match) and they made huge efforts to magic a space for us in their fully booked car park. When we arrived later than planned due to traffic the steward recognised that it would be a tricky journey from our allocated space and directed us to a much handier space. You passed the loo on the way to our seats. It was clearly signposted, clean, spacious with grab rails and for once at a football stadium hot water. The automatic soap dispenser was a bonus!"
mcdonald road library edinburgh,positive,"Disabled parking bays are immediately outside the front door. Can be busy at some times of day. The accessible toilet is accessed from the main library by going through two doors. It is clean, spacious and equipped with grab rails."
mcdonalds chesterfield,positive,"When in use the toilets are fine, plenty of room to manoeuvre if in a wheelchair or scooter."
mcdonalds edinburgh,negative,"Parking could be tricky unless you parked in Charlotte square or George street. Lots of buses, and the tram stop nearby"
mcdonalds edinburgh,positive,There were two spaces which you had to parallel park at. They were quite tight & lucky there was no one else there. There are loads of buses that go there - one bus stop is right across the road. They were very good and had a lot of room. You may need help with the doors to get in. Huge and very clean accessible loo (see pic) Have to ask staff for the code. 2 disabled parking bays. Lots of buses stop nearby too. Good accessible loo but requires a radar key
mcdonalds forfar,negative,"They get two starts because despite the dodgy lock, the actual toilet layout and cleanliness was good and the red cord hit the floor."
mcdonalds forfar,positive,Two disabled bay as close to the door as possible.
mcdonalds glasgow,positive,You would need to get a train and walk or use the parking facilities that are a two minute walk away
mcdonalds knaresborough,positive,"The disabled parking is to the rear of the building. It could become a little confusing as there are disabled parking bays which are signposted however they are aimed at customs visiting individual shops at the other side of the retail park so are a little walk away from the McDonalds. The McDonalds does have disabled parking of its own, this us located at the rear of the building and a wheelchair accessible entrance leads on from there.  Relating to public transport there is a bus stop right at the side of McDonalds, the path also is accessible and therefore would mean using public transport to get there would defiantly be an option.  The loo was totally assessable in terms of flat ground etc however the door to get into the corridor where the toilets are is only an average tall but single door therefore we feel as though someone with a wider chair would not get through the door. "
mcdonalds lancaster,negative,Its a central location so parking is a distance away
mcdonalds lincoln,positive,All macdonalds restaurants have good toilets only drawbacks are shared with baby changing and hand driers could be better positioned
mcdonalds liverpool,negative,Has a standard accessible toilet which is clean enough
mcdonalds newport,negative,"There is disabled parking but there could be more. There is one in Asda, but it is too far away and no clear signs for it in McDonald's."
mcdonalds york,negative,"Not so brilliant because on the day that I visited there was a yellow cone warning of 'wet floor' left in the accessible toilet - obviously, because of the space available in such a toilet. However this impeded the 'flow' of my mobility scooter and the rest of the room. I did not notice any disabled parking and the curb outside the restaurant was high. The cobble streets outside might make access difficult."
mcdonalds york,positive,"Large clean disabled toilet located on the ground floor. Blake Street is one of the few streets in York City centre where Blue Badge holders can park. If you're lucky (and I was on this day) you can park directly outside the venue. The normal public toilets are on the first floor although at the back of the store there is a disabled toilet. Although to get to this toilet there is quite a small space to manoeuvre the wheelchair to access this, this becomes increasingly busy if the store is busy and all tables are occupied as difficult to manoeuvre between them. Once in the toilet, spacious, clean, stocked up and all necessary items/equipment was of a suitable height. Disabled toilet downstairs."
mcintyres hair salon dundee,positive,"The salon is on the Perth Road, close to the universities and about a ten min walk from town. There are many bus stops on this road, there was on street parking for blue badge holders. "
mds motherwell,negative,"There are many accessible toilets throughout the park however, the food court toilet needs people to take care as my partner injured her right hip and thigh thanks to the grab rails being too close to the toilet.   The grab rail is positioned only inches from the toilet and at near enough the same height.  The grab rails also blend in with the walls so not appropriate for visually impaired customers.  The emergency pull cord was coiled up on the toilet cistern as well so if you had a fall you were stuck."
mds motherwell,positive,Although there are several disabled parking bays outside the main entrance to M&D's there aren't enough of them also the ones that are there seem to be abused by people who don't actually need them.
mead open farm leighton buzzard,positive,"Plenty of accessible parking spaces right outside. A good, spacious loo with rails, low sink and mirror. This was located next to the other toilets and didn't need a Radar key to access. Very straightforward!"
meadow lane stadium nottingham,positive,There may have been parking nearer to the ground but as an away supporter we parked on a nearby car park. There possibly was car parking closer for disabled Very close by
meadowbank retail park edinburgh,negative,"There is a large car park with several disabled bays, public transport is good as this venue is off a main road.  Arrival by foot is also an option."
meadowhall shopping centre sheffield,negative,Not enough disabled parking spaces. eg. none outside Boots But they always smell unpleasant and are too hot.
meadowhall shopping centre sheffield,positive,"There are several car parks around the shopping centre; all of the car parks have disabled parking and non-disabled spaces.  The building can be easily accessed from these spaces via pedestrian walkways and lowered curbs. There are several toilets, including non-disabled and disabled, in the shopping centre all of which are easily accessible and signposted. There is plenty of disabled parking close to the doors of every entrance into the shopping centre enabling easy access for all, also there are drop off points next to the entrance to enable easy access. There are many toilets throughout the shopping centre, there are a set of toilets at each end including in the major shops with cafes such as BHS and Marks and Spencers. Many disabled parking spaces are available across all the car parks around Meadowhall. However, if you park in a non-disabled space, there are no lowered curbs close by. Buses, trams and trains are available just outside the building. There are a number of disabled toilets throughout the shopping centre."
meadowhead christian fellowship sheffield,positive,"The food bank is accessible by car, bus, taxi and on foot. The nearest train station is roughly a 10 minute driveway in Dronfield. The bus stop is on the main road and is in close walking distance from the community church and has direct routes into Sheffield city centre. There is 1 disabled parking bay in the car park and no car parking charge applies. A dropped kerb leads from the car park to the ramp. Ideally more disabled parking spaces are requires. To access the accessible toilet a person using a wheelchair would need to go through the single door to the rear of the large community room. The door width would accommodate an electric wheelchair and there is enough turning space to turn the wheelchair in the corridor so that the wheelchair is facing left. Travel down the corridor and your will notice the accessible toilet directly in front of you. The toilet is signposted and is clean and tidy. There is enough space for a carer. Key features of the disabled toilet:    •	Door opening 86cm/door opens outwards  •	Drop down rail on the right hand side of the toilet  •	Vertical/horizontal rail on the left hand side wall •	Toilet is 19 inch in height  •	Sink is 90 cm high from the floor  •	Hand dryer is 100cm high from the floor  •	Lower position mirror on the wall  •	Lever tap with thermostatic control •	Emergency pull chord in situ  •	Light switch in reaching distance"
meadowsweet bungalow lochgilphead,positive,"As the house is in the country, about 6 miles from Lochgilphead, it's probably best to drive. There is a big driveway with parking for several cars. Though most if it is gravel, there is plenty of space to park so that the passenger door or the tailgate (to unload a wheelchair) is next to the paved area at the foot of the ramp. The bathroom is spacious. The toilet has drop down rails on both sides. The wash hand basin is lowered and a shower chair/commode is provided for the wet room, as well as a freestanding stool. There is a second toilet and shower room for more able visitors."
mearns castle golf academy newton mearns,positive,"It was relatively easy for me, as I went by car. The accessible loo had plenty space to move around and everything at a good height. Plenty grab rails."
mecca bingo dundee playhouse dundee,negative,"The accessible toilets are bigger cubicles within the male and female toilets. I would say they aren’t very big for a wheelchair user, especially if they need assistance for someone else. These accessible cubicles would cause issues if someone needed assistance from someone else who is of the opposite gender. I’m not sure if there are any accessible toilets in nuteral gender toilets, I didn’t see other toilets.  Nearest Changing Places toilet during the day is at the V&A Dundee."
mecca bingo dundee playhouse dundee,positive,"At the main entrance there isn’t any on-street parking nearby but, there is a taxi rank across the road and also from a previous visit an accessible taxi was able to drop me off right at the front door. MECCA Bingo is situated in the city centre where it is roughly a 10 minute walk away from the bus and train station.  There is also a back entrance to MECCA Bingo where there is an indoor car park. Near the door entrance there are 3 accessible parking spaces and there are standard parking spaces at a lower level, although if you can’t go up stairs you would have to go up the ramp where cars go. It is free to park in the MECCA Bingo car park, you need to register your car at reception. Within the city centre of Dundee there’s also plenty of council car parks which are free for blue badge holders."
mecca glasgow forge glasgow,positive,The parking is good on a massive car park also buses are very good  The toilets for disabled are in the main toilets 
medi optics opticians cardiff,positive,Disabled space outside but dropped kerb access not ideal
medina of marrakesh marrakesh,negative,"The only real way of getting around risk free is a taxi, All hotel transport are mini busses or coaches with generally 3 or 4 steps - even though they know you are I a wheelchair they will just book you on  (with the exception of booking a WAV through your travel agent which they do and a reasonably steep ramp - but no different to those used in Heathrow). Be aware of agreeing a price before getting into a taxi - - generally start negotiations at a third of the price they suggested and finish at 50% our hotel was 20KM from the city centre a 25 m drive and a reasonable price is 100 -150 DH - about £15.  As far as parking is going, there is standard parking, mostly in the centre - you abandon your car somewhere, although there are formal carparks dotted about. I would leave the car at the hotel and get a taxi in, there is no such thing as an accessible parking bay as far as I could see."
meeth quarry nature reserve okehampton,positive,Large Parking area. Rough in places. No specific disabled parking spaces.
meggetland edinburgh,negative,"A distinct lack of disabled bays,and the one we had booked was occupied by he media.  Probably best to arrive by foot but even then there is a long walk to the stand."
melanzana london,negative,Could be a challenge to get to and it's probably a difficulty for wheelchair users. Cant recall if disabled accessible inside
melia berlin berlin,positive,"The only wheelchair accessible public toilet in the hotel is on the ground level. The toilet is roomy with dropdown bars either side of the toilet, there is room under the sink for a wheelchair user and both the toilet flush and the tap are sensor operated."
meltmongers edinburgh,positive,"I drove and parked nearby which is fairly easy on a weekend, I didn't see any disabled parking bays but that's not to say they weren't any as there are lots of places to park nearby. There are good bus links into town from here."
memorial and museum auschwitz birkenau oswiecim,positive,"Auschwitz-Birkenau is about a hour's drive from Krakow. When I was researching it, I found it was possible to do the trip independently using public transport. I personally decided against this and chose to go as part of a guided tour as I thought it would take a lot out of me emotionally and physically and I didn't want the stress of having to make my own way there and back. Having been I feel I made the right choice.  The company I went with was Krakow Direct but there a many companies offering similar trips from Krakow and these run on a daily basis. I went as part of a group tour and this cost about £45 (2019) and everything was included. I was picked up near my accommodation, joined a small minibus which had 3 - 4 steps with grab rails. the seating layout was 2 seats an aisle and a single seat, and I found the journey was comfortable. On the way there a video in English was played on a screen which was about the history of Auschwitz-Birkenau. This provided some useful background information. As well as the driver there was an English speaking guide who explained the practical aspects of the day.  The company I went with parked the minibus in a restaurant and toilet area opposite the entrance of Auschwitz and it was a short 2 - 3 minutes to cross the road (no drop kerb) to arrive at the entrance.  Auschwitz  Outside Auschwitz's entrance there is an accessible toilet with grab rails in the basement. However I only saw stairs to get to it. Where the minibus parked there were signs for toilets including an accessible toilet. It was clean and reasonably spacious. There is a small charge for using the toilets.  I didn't notice any signs for toilets inside Auschwitz camp itself.   Birkenau  In the car park about 5 minutes from the entrance there are toilets including accessible toilets, but I did not use these. I didn't notice any signs for toilets inside Birkenau camp itself."
mercadona arona,negative,"I was staying nearby so did not require to use transport. I didn't notice a specific carpark, but it is possible to park in streets nearby. Bigger streets do have marked disabled bays.  There are also lots of taxis in the area, and many bus stops. Local buses (green in colour), have disabled access, the buses themselves can lower, and the set of doors in the middle of the bus is wider which allow easier access."
mercat shopping kirkcaldy,negative,"The toilets are accessible, however, the cubicles are small and there is no station for Urostomy and would be hard to access in a wheelchair."
mercat shopping kirkcaldy,positive,Plenty of parking space and easy access to all shop and the mall. 
mercat tours edinburgh,positive,"There is ample parking around the Royal Mile, parked on Chambers Street next to the museum however this might not be practical if you have difficulty walking. Getting up on to the Royal Mile was easy as there are loads of buses passing along the nearby bridges. Further up the street then went across the George IV bridge. All the lothian buses are wheelchair accessible.  The railways station was a ten minute walk away. We parked in Chamber street as we were not aware of any closer blue badge spaces, this was only a 10 minute walk/roll to the meeting place. The meeting point is also within 5 minutes walk of lots of the LRT bus routes."
merchants 1688 lancaster,negative,"No Car Parking,  5 min walk from Lancaster Railway station"
merchants tea rooms colyton,negative,Colyton village where the tea rooms is located is about a 10 - 15 minute walk from Colyton Tram Station. 
merchiston library edinburgh,negative,"Buses stop nearby at Holy Corner - it is a few minutes stroll then to the campus of which the terrain is uneven and bumpy. One crossing can be dangerous at peak times so care is needed. Car parking available outside - metered and blue badge bays. From this the entrance is on the right hand side down two steps or a ramp.  Near to the university entrance round a sharp corner. Accessed via swipe card or security card. If you don't have these right away and can, ask the Helpdesk and they have access. Room inside for a wheelchair user and assistant. The door locks by a touchpad mechanism and beeps when it is locked. There is handrails and a red cord on the left hand side. Space under the sink to roll under and mirror above sink."
mercure banbury whately hall hotel banbury,negative,"You enter car park by a very narrow alleyway, our large car barely made it through, and we found two disabled bays pressed up tight against hotel walls, very difficult to park up, and hard to turn around so as to exit the same way out of narrow alley. For disabled it seemed free, as we did not have to go through the barrier, which meant a payment due, but it was a very dirty run down area. I did not find disabled toilet, and made do with gents."
mercure box hill burford bridge hotel dorking,negative,The only negative about the Burford Bridge is the parking. The car park is on the opposite side of the road on a blind bend so crossing the road is dangerous and I would not do so without an able bodied person to check for fast moving traffic. The disabled spaces are next to the exit but very small (normal car parking size with no space to open the door wide or for a manual wheelchair). 
mercure box hill burford bridge hotel dorking,positive,Very clean and spacious. See photo
mercure brighton seafront hotel brighton,negative,"We did not get to use or see the accessible Loo as the lift to that Loo was broken on the day we visited, but the staff were very apologetic and offered us a bedroom to change my son, We were not staying at the Hotel, just visiting for a family Wedding"
mercure brighton seafront hotel brighton,positive,Parking at the front of the Hoteloverlooking the Sea
mercure edinburgh city edinburgh,negative,The accessibile room has its own accessible toilet and there is a small accessible toilet in the reception area which is very restricted for space.
mercure edinburgh city edinburgh,positive,"The hotel is ideally placed for the various forms of public transport that pass along Princes Street; including the many buses and the trams. There is no parking in this area however as the hotel is on Princes St there is a good bus service going along the street. There is also the tram system that runs between York St and the Airport. Waverly train stations is about 10 minutes walk away and the Edinburgh bus station about 15 to 20 minutes away. There is one accessible toilet on the first floor located next to the lifts. there is room for a carer to assist in this area if required. Access is via 2 doors.  There was a red cord in this toilet but was tied up Red Cord card left Located on Princes St- so loads of buses, the tram and taxis"
mercure edinburgh haymarket edinburgh,positive,I arrived using public transport and it was fairly easy to get to the hotel. The buses stop at the top of the street and also in nearby Lothian Road. There are connections to most parts of the city and the buses were wheelchair accessible for my travelling companion. The hotel had a large accessible toilet next to the gym. The hotel is situated on a busy side street. There is limited parking on the street.  It’s a short distance to the nearest bus stops that serve many parts of the city. Local buses (Lothian) are all wheelchair accessible.  Taxis can drop off at the front door.  For the more adventurous you could even arrive by canal as the canal basin is two minutes walk away! Next to the gym on the lower floor was an accessible loo. It followed the high standard of the facilities in the accessible bedrooms. A large doorway to get in and plenty of space to move around.
mercure madrid centro madrid,positive,"It was fine for our taxi to drop us off right outside, and the hotel was completely cool with having my rented mobility scooter delivered there, and with charging it overnight in reception each night. Around central Madrid, dropped kerbs were generally fine and the buses were all accessible. Our accessible bathroom was clean, attractive and modern."
mercure peebles barony castle hotel eddleston,positive,There are disabled spaces near the front of the hotel
mercure shakespeare hotel stratford upon avon,positive,"Although only two disabled bays, it was nice to find they have this facility available, and other bays are quite close anyway. They stand next to rear entrance to hotel, on the flat, with automatic doors. The toilet is Just average size, did not seem to be a problem there, very clean and tidy, with grab rails and pull cord."
mercure shrewsbury albrighton hall hotel spa shrewsbury,negative,"This particular car park area for the Spa was at least on level ground, so if you wish to visit, make sure you take the Driveway signed for Spa. Disappointing to say the least, very plain typical cubicle toilets, could not even get chair up the steps to be able to use them, so low marks for this lack of support for disabled. As you arrive towards the house you natuarally follow signs straight ahead for reception, which takes you into a reasonably big car park, but there are no disabled bays here. If we had known, we would have turned left at a junction in the grounds itself, marked for Spa, and that would have given us a far easier entry into the hotel. For the reason we did not know about this entrance, we have dropped marks to 3.5 overall. This left turn for the Spa is reviewed in PART TWO of ALBRIGHTON HALL. No accessible toilets, just plain ladies and gents, and if you are wheelchair bound, they are of no use to us at all, you have high steps to get up, no ramp provided, as far to steep anyway, so I’m afraid it’s cross your legs and hope time. The toilets are just normal cubicle sizes, so it means getting up out of chair, no pull cords or grab rails, and two doors have to be pushed to get inside toilet area. Very disappointing ."
mercure st pauls hotel and spa sheffield,positive,"The Hotel is located in city centre, under half a mile away from Sheffield train and bus station. The route is pedestrianized for those not using transport but does include uphill terrain. Cars and taxis can drop off guests directly outside the hotels main entrance and a concierge is on hand to assist with luggage. If a guest wishes to use the valet car parking service it is usually chargeable, however, if the driver of the car is a blue badge holder this service is offered complementary. There is no on site car park, however, the NCP Arundel Gate is 0.2 miles away. There is an accessible toilet in the lobby area of the hotel which features grab rails around the toilet and panic cords in case a guest requires assistance. The entrance to the toilet is wide and the room itself is large allowing for movement. There are also accessible bedrooms within the hotel; these rooms also have an accessible bathroom which includes a walk-in shower with a fitted shower seat, grab rails, panic cord and sliding door for easier access."
mercure telford centre hotel telford,negative,"Easy enough to drive to, as long as you follow Sat NAV directions carefully.  A very large car park is available. Easy to find toilet, but had to leave chair outside in passage and struggle in, and then it was very plain with bare needs. It had grab rails and pull cord, very clean and tidy, and Carer could help you if needed."
mercure winchester wessex hotel winchester,negative,There were approximately three disabled spaces at the front - parking charges apply I think? It was in the basement reached by a tiny lift but it was acceptable with handrails etc.
mere sands wood nature reserve rufford,positive,A car park with two disabled places. 
mermaid quay cardiff,positive,Disabled Parking in nearby car parks (fee). Mermaid Quay toilets tucked away on first floor but lift access available.  Most of the restaurants have accessible toilets.
merseyside maritime museum liverpool,negative,"Clean and tidy, sturdy grab rails and a light easy to move door, but the red cord needed to be put in its right place first."
merseyside maritime museum liverpool,positive,"We were staying nearby so didn't need transport , but there is a bus station across the road from the Albert Dock , where the Maritime Museum can be found and where tour starts.    There are three blue badge parking spaces in the car park on the left hand side of the road leading into the Albert Dock, These are about 150 yards from the main entrance to the museum. The route from this car park to the museum entrance is paved, and involves crossing one road at a pedestrian crossing.  Another four designated blue badge spaces are available in the on-street parking on the approach road, which are slightly further away from the museum building. Charges apply for parking in both these areas.  My reason for not giving 5 stars is that not having tried to use the parking , I don't know how easy it would be to park as all the spaces were full when we went passed the car park . Changing places toilet in Maritime museum on 2nd floor. I didn't assess the facility as immediately went on the tour , but just having one in place automatically impresses and hence the score as can be used by anyone- so well done Liverpool Museums ( others take note!) Lots of paid parking of good quality. Disabled bays few and far between but city is not designed around cars. Shopmobility free scooter and wheelchair use available.  All that was needed was there. Just lost a point for misplaced cords and loo doors in Maritime Museum badly designed in that when the door was open it blocked access to ambulance loos.  We stayed in a hotel close by so didn't use the parking facilities on this occasion however there were disabled parking spaces close to the venue. There are also frequent open top tour buses that stop at Albert Docks. From memory, at least one disabled toilet on each floor. Plenty of nearby public transport with good access.  The friendly MerseyRail service is a firm favourite for me. Only thing I really don't like is the lack of tarmac to get in, being the old docks area they do like their cobblestones!"
messonghi beach holiday resort moraitika,negative,No special acessible toilets available.
metrobus berlin,positive,"It would be five stars but for the occasional driver who didn't ""curtsey"" the bus to enable me to back the manual wheelchair off without using the ramp and for the occasional fellow passengers who didn't vacate the wheelchair spaces. Bus stops are clearly labeled and provide clear information about timetables and routes."
metropole hotel and spa llandrindod wells,positive,Big car park at back with disabled spaces. Level entrance from car park with lift to public areas.
metropolitano de lisboa lisbon,positive,The Metro is right across from the cruise terminal. At the moment the pedestrian route into town is inaccessible due to building works at th port. 
mia italian kitchen edinburgh,negative,"There are disabled parking spaces in nearby streets but it is on the Dalry Rd and you can't park outside but can drop off. There is a good sized accessible toilet - however, it is currently also used as a storage area. Again staff are quick to clear things out but this is not good enough as it requires the customer to signal they need the loo!"
mia italian kitchen edinburgh,positive,"Although they don't have any dedicated parking, there is on street parking that can be used at any time by blue badge holders. Large dedicated disabled toilets. On street parking easy in the evening . No idea if the same is true earlier in the day! Given 4 stars as they had a disabled loo which is a rare thing in restaurants. So used to places not having any that i didn't think to try it out , so  my rating maybe under or over the actual facility!"
mia italian kitchen morningside edinburgh,positive,Lots of busses pass right by the restaurant and their is stop just a few steps outside. 
michael hoppen gallery london,positive,Nearest tube is Sloane Square which has platform to street escalator service for exit only. I travelled by bus and lots of buses stop nearby.
michaelhouse cafe cambridge,negative,"Michaelhouse Centre is situated on Trinity Street in Cambridge city centre, which is largely pedestrianised. There are some Blue Badge parking bays on nearby King's Parade and Peas Hill. The nearest car park is on Park Street, 300 metres away, which also has some Blue Badge spaces. There is an unloading bay immediately outside the cafe, but vehicular access to  Trinity Street is restricted during the daytime. There are regular accessible buses into Cambridge city centre; the nearest bus stop is approximately 0.4 miles away."
michaelhouse cafe cambridge,positive,"There is one accessible toilet on the ground floor. Access is via a rather narrow passageway and heavy door from the cafe, but then the door to the toilet is wide. There is a fixed rail on the right-hand side of the toilet and a drop-down rail on the left, with room for side transfer, although the toilet is not the most spacious."
michaels golden chippie restaurant daventry,positive,Car park behind shop. Disabled spaces in adjacent car park for Ashby road co-op
michaels indian restaurant blackpool,positive,When we arrived there was on street parking with a Blue Badge but you do have to be careful not to park in resident permit bays. There were also several buses running along the main road. A modern accessible toilet was clearly signposted. It was spacious and had the requisite grab rails. Staff were happy to help with the door.
mickley hall clay shooting ground holmes chapel,negative,I saw or saw signs to an accessible toilet but didn’t use it.
mickley hall clay shooting ground holmes chapel,positive,"Nice big parking areas. We usually take a Large van or a trailer hitched to a car to carry the Tramper. No problem getting it parked up in an area suitable to load and unload. Nice large clean toilets. Easy to get in an out of. Toilets are accessible Plenty of parking on hard,compact stone"
mics sant jordi barcelona,positive,"We were dropped off by taxi from the airport and also picked up on our departure day. Taxi was brilliant and the driver was very friendly. The taxi was able to park right outside the hotel. Perfect.  There is a metro station on the doorstep of the hotel, which makes it extremely easy to get to and from the city centre and surrounding areas. I found the metro very easy and accessible. I loved that it was outside the hotel.  The en-suite bathroom was accessible and met my needs. The toilet had space on one side to position my wheelchair for transferring. Grab bars were located on both sides of the toilet.  I always struggle with hotel bathroom sinks because they are usually too small, but this sink was the perfect height and size for my wheelchair. I was able to roll underneath and I could even see in the large mirror above the sink.  The roll-in shower was accessible for a shower wheelchair. There was also a folding shower seat attached to the wall if you prefer to use that instead. I found that the grab bars, shower controls and towel rail were all within reach of the seat.  An emergency cord was located in the shower and next to the toilet with a ball at the end. I think the ball could be much easier for people to grip.  We only used public transport so don't know what parking is like. We love the public transport in Barcelona, the Metro, Tram and Bus network is great as a power wheelchair user. Our friends who are Spanish has booked the Mon Bus to Sitges and Plana Bus to Tarragona a number of times for us and that too works very well as a day trip. As a wheelchair user you do have to book the bus. From the bed my wife hoists me onto a commode shower chair and I can have access to the shower use the toilet or use the sink from the one lift. It saves a lot of time and energy we use the same method at home. MICs is home from home with the added benefit of sunshine.  We have not found one toilet on our travels around Barcelona or beyond with a hoist in a disabled toilet. No parking needed as we arrived on public transport. The metro lift is at the bottom on the entrance ramp to the front door of MICs, and another lift is directly across the road which you come up coming from La Rambla. There is also a bus stop outside but we didn’t use that. It is worth looking at the T10, T30, T50, or T70 travel cards they are exactly as they say in trips. Depending on how much you are going to travel. We stayed within zone 1 but that is a big area and we done 48 trips for the week. They work on the metro, buses, trams and trains all very wheelchair friendly (another review on Barcelona). I don't know if there was a public toilet we only needed to use the one in our room. I only used the sink in my wheelchair otherwise my wife put me on the shower commode chair in the bedroom for the shower and toilet. "

mid hants railway watercress line new alresford,positive,There is disabled parking in car park near to the first station and nearest for us which has a few disabled spaces and is operated by the local council.  There are disabled toilets in the stations but not on the trains due to their age. So it’s advisable to go before you embark the trains. 
middlesbrough institute of modern art mima middlesbrough,positive,"There are six disabled parking spaces in MIMA's car park and also more on the road next to the car park, the access between disabled spaces and the building is all level besides a one and a half inch lip at the floor of the back doors, the front entrance is more accessible and only requires you to go a short distance through the garden The disabled toilet is on the ground floor near the cafe, all access is level, the toilet door is wide enough to accommodate any wheelchair.

millennium hotel glasgow glasgow,negative,Not sure on the parking but if you left Queen Street station via the George  Square exit as you come down the ramp there is a push pad door in your left which takes into the hotel. Best place to stay if you want to be In the city centre and are taking. The train. Taxis could also pick up and drop off right outside this door.
millennium hotel glasgow glasgow,positive,The toilet in the room wasn't a good size plenty room to move around in and park next to the toilet to do a sliding transfer. Plenty of grab rails. The toilets at reception area also a good size and has a passcode to get  into which stops everyone from using it.
miller carter cardiff the hayes cardiff,negative,City centre venue in pedestrianised zone so no dedicated parking.  Lots of Disabled bays in nearby St David's centre  - approx 500m from venue.
miller carter cardiff the hayes cardiff,positive,Large accessible loo.  Ask staff to open.
miller carter lytham saint annes,positive,We drove and parking was no issue. It is a large car park and there were disabled spaces available. Accessible toilet with ample room and grab rails. Was shared with baby changing facilities. It was clean and tidy.
miller carter shirley,negative,"No such available, just basic toilets, and you need to get down and then up again if you need to use them, that’s disappointing for a big brand name. Then to cap it all you still need to get down another step to reach your toilet, we hope they will Try to sort out, but there again, they get enough customers as it is, so will they bother, let’s wait and see  We gave it half a mark, simply because at least they have a toilet for you.      "
miller carter shirley,positive,"Lots of parking, easy to get to restaurant, and first impressions were not to bad."
millers tearoom at heron lakes beverley,positive,"There are two disabled parking spaces very close to the level walkway to the door There is disabled toilet which doubles up as ladies toilet, to get a wheelchair in a chair might need to be moved hear the doorway but I am sure that would be easily dealt with. The toilets had a handrail and there was plenty of room to turn a wheelchair around if needed, the handbasin was low enough for a wheelchair user as was the hand drier."
millig practice helensburgh,negative,"There is an accessible toilet. Generally ok, the flush handle is on the 'wall' side of the toilet, perhaps making it slightly trickier for someone to reach if sitting in their wheelchair at the opposite side. Not a major issue, just seemed a bit odd to me!  Didn't notice an orange safety cord, but there may have been one.   It is also the baby change area."
millig practice helensburgh,positive,"The building has its own car-park underneath it, with marked disabled bays. You reach the car-park by driving in through the Co-op supermarket car-park. Both have a fairly low ceiling height, fine for most vehicles, but good to highlight just in-case.  A lift goes from the car-park into the doctors building (shared car-park and lift for both practices)  The doctors isn't far from the town centre, and a short distance from the train station, where as well as trains, there is a local bus stop and a taxi rank. "
milnes bar edinburgh,negative,Rose Street is just behind Princes Street which you can access very easily by bus and tram. Unsure about parking situation.
milton keynes theatre milton keynes,negative,there are accessible loos on all floors. so easy to find.  I get in with my power chair + carer.  With 5 accessible loos in the building I  can find the best one for me to use. 
milton park innovation centre milton,positive,5 spaces out the front.  Always available. on all three floors
mimis bakehouse edinburgh,positive,"Buses stop outside as can taxis. Parking is available in nearby streets. Near the shore, managed to nab one of the view accessible spaces round the corner. Wee bit of a squeeze to get in door but my chair is a bulky chap and it was still do-able. Spotless with all grab rails as you'd expect. Transport is excellent as Lothian Buses 22 and 35 both come right to the door of Mimi's! Parking is a bit more tricky however and it might be difficult to find spaces nearby."
mimis little bakehouse   city art centre edinburgh,positive,"From Waverley Train Station we exited, crossed Market Street and the cafe was directly in front of us. The toilet are through in the City Art Centre. The cafe is connected by a short corridor. Usually there are tables there but they are currently not being used to help with social distancing. The accessible toilet is the first one you come to. It was clean. Quite a small sink. "
miners peg birch green,positive,"large car park with a few Disable parking bays near the front door .. Bus Service stops at the ASDA store across the road  Clean large Toilet . with Auto lights , located at the rear of the pub , good spacing between tables to use a wheelchair "
minstrels gallery ambleside,positive,"We arrived by car, but there is a bus service "
mitchell library and theatre glasgow,positive,"3 on street disabled bays directly in front of the level access entry point to the library (Granville street). There were 2 disabled toilets on the ground floor that i used. Both were perfect for me and very spacious, but 1 of the toilets had 2 single doors to go through that were close together which could prove an issue for anyone in an electric wheelchair. I drove to the venue and used the on-street parking which is situated on the left hand side and round the back of the building.  More than one disabled toilet, which is always a welcome sign. Not the most spacious in the world, but enough to get by and there are grab rails present. The toilet I chose to use wasn't the cleanest at the time, but I'm sure that was just a one-off.  There are three disabled parking spaces in front of the entrance at Granville street. There is also a bus stop nearby on Berkeley Street and Charing Cross train station across the bridge over the M8.   There are two disabled toilets.Toilets are located behind the help desk at the Granville Street entrance and opposite the lifts on the same floors. There are only disabled toilets on the ground floor. "
mitchells dundee,positive,"There is no specific parking spaces for the cafe but we have always been able to find a space outside using the blue badge. There are bus stops nearby, a small taxi rank and a train station There isn’t any signage for the toilet and the toilets aren’t actually in Mitchells- you go through the open doors at the back end of the cafe into lovely Forgans, turn left and go along the bar and tables which is difficult if there are people sitting there as they may need to move to make space, the toilet is at the end on the right. It has a pull door which isn’t heavy, the bathroom is quite big and is always clean and smells fresh. Transfering would be done at the left side, the link is low. There is space for another person. "
mjs brasserie clarkston,negative,"on Street parking currently not too busy, but new health centre due to open up nearby may  impact; widepavement but all flat from kerb to door"
mjs brasserie clarkston,positive,"possibly need some help opening the door from restaurant to toilet area, but large, clean and unclutterred disabled toilet beyond"
mms world london,negative,"Is in central London so driving and parking could be difficult. Lots of public transport nearby; buses, taxis and underground (Leicester Square nearest underground) but depends on your own needs which is most suitable."
mms world london,positive,"Can be tricky to get to, if you have the patience to find a parking space on street there are a few available, though there is not an accessible tube station nearby. I would recommend getting the tube to Green Park Station, then getting a bus and rolling the 0.7 mile to Leicester Square. There are toilets in store however they were out of order when I was there."
mnd scotlands clayton lodge st andrews,positive,"There is a bus stop right outside the site and you have 2 private parking spaces outside the lodge. The lodge is fitted with a huge wet room and a closamat toilet. Ample parking for 2/3 cars. Bus stop immediately outside caravan park for travel to Cupar / St Andrews and beyond Clos-o-Mat loo. Wetroom was very big, very clean throughout. Adjustable shower chair / commode "
moat brae dumfries,positive,"Huge,plenty space to manoeuvre , all the usual grab rails, clean and fresh . Red cord in situ. No changing places toilet"
mobility assistance birmingham,positive,Had a delivery
mobiloo stonehouse,positive,The loo comes to you.  Top notch for mobile toilets if you have ever had to rely on portable loo described as accessible.  
modern art oxford oxford,negative,Non existent but there are buses into the centre of Oxford which has a lot of pedestrian and wheelchair accessible streets. 
moffat mill moffat,positive,There are Blue Badge spaces to the left hand side of the main door as you go in unsure about public transport in the are but the venue is popular with the holiday coach tour firms that you see on the motorway 
molineux stadium wolverhampton,positive,Parking up a side street for disabled with badge. Perfect Right next to disabled access on flat level
molletts farm saxmundham,negative,"There is ample parking space.  However, the parking is currently surrounded by gravel; something that is being adapted quickly so that users can park their cars and transfer with ease."
molletts farm saxmundham,positive,"Mollett's use Motionspot Bathrooms.  Their accessible bathrooms are beautiful – not clinical – whilst boasting everything that those with disabilities could need, from sensored mirrors that light up with a swipe of the hand, to gorgeous chrome grab rails and towel heaters that will never be hot enough to burn hands.  The best part of all? Most of this equipment is portable and can be removed within five minutes, although I seriously doubt that anyone who doesn’t require a shower seat or sink of wheelchair height would even recognise the difference; it is that stunning."
molly mays tea room dumfries,positive,80 metres from main bus stops.   10 accessible parking bays within 120 metres of venue Bright and clean.   Transfer from right side only.   Emergency pull cord reaches the floor but on closed side of toilet.  Lacking mirror.  Will make 5 or 6 recommendations to the owner at the next visit.
mommy thai leeds,positive,In town centre to lots of parking. 
mon repos corfu,positive,Slightly outside Corfu Town centre but reachable by no 2 bus (April 2019). I took a taxi there and the taxi waited for me to return.
mona museum of old and new art berriedale,positive,"Some parking available, but boat accessible. On top floor at entrance. Plenty of space, shared with baby changing facilities."
monboddo edinburgh,positive,There is parking on neighbouring streets to Bread Street and there are many bus services which stop on Lothian Road which is a short distance away.  There is a pristine accessible loo which is located in the hotel lobby next to the bar. It is accessed through the door to the left of the bar. It is a good size and would accommodate all wheelchairs. It also has a baby changing facility. 
moniack mhor scotlands creative writing centre kiltarlity,negative,"As mentioned above, it’s not super accessible to big chairs, but once you’re in it’s nice and spacious."
moniack mhor scotlands creative writing centre kiltarlity,positive,"Large and easy access, plenty of hand rails and a combined wet room It’s in the middle of nowhere in Scotland... it’s as easy to get to as you’d expect. But my mum and I aren’t known for navigation skills, and we got there pretty easily. There’s plenty of parking space."
monikie country park dundee,positive,"Near the entrance to Monikie there are four accessible parking spaces available. You have to pay to park at Monikie Country Park however, if you are a blue badge holder you are able to park for free. I think if it was a quiet day that the standard parking spaces would be suitable for wheelchair users to us as they are plenty of them available and they are still not too far away from the main park entrance. The ground surface of the car park is very even.  Monikie is located in a rural area of Angus and I’m unsure of what the public transport services would be like for visiting. The toilets are located at the entrance to Monikie Country Park and directly infront of the accessible parking spaces. The male and female toilets are accessed by a step however, there is an accessible toilet that has level access between the male and female toilets. The accessible toilet is very small though and I can imagine it would be quite difficult for a wheelchair user to use, especially if they require assistance from someone else.  Like all toilets is a public park, they weren’t very clean. I mean I felt it was cleaner than others that I have visited. You can see the size of the accessible toilet in an image below showing my wheelchair in it."
monkey forest stoke on trent,positive,"I think a person of limited mobility would struggle to walk round here on foot, and as their website says they have no wheelchairs or mobility scooters for hire.  The car park is not too far away from the entrance but not as close as the web site had me believe."
monkey haven newport,positive,"Bus stop directly outside the attraction Well signed blue badge parking next to the building entailing just 3 short rolls/ steps on tightly impacted gravel to the pathway. Free Parking for all visitors large dedicated toilet with separate baby change facilities elsewhere no RADAR key entry. Excellent signage and ramped entrance Wide doorway Plenty of handrails, both fixed and pull down Well placed mirror Easily reached sink  Very clean and well kept"
monkey haven wootton bridge,positive,"Free parking for all. A flat parking area consisting of compacted gravel, so not perfect for a wheelchair user, but manageable on the more compacted areas. Dedicated blue badge parking area. Lovely accessible toilet, clearly marked with a ramp up to it. There was a separate baby changing area so there was't a queue for the loo which was great. The toilet had a number of grab rails (see photo) and was spotless, despite being at the heart of the holiday season. Perfect!"
monkey world   ape rescue centre longthorns,positive,"Disabled parking bays at the right of the entrance. some are on gravel / slightly muddy. sufficient space, but maybe a good driver will have no problems moving around however I had fun with reversing out of the toilet near the cafe.  Bars and rails.   a chair in the toilet."
monkeynuts london,positive,"Good disabled toilet, but it is combined with the baby change which is often busy"
monklands hospital airdrie,positive,Disabled parking is provided at the main entrance of the hospital but there are more spaces in the other car parks around the building. However the best spaces to use are those at the main entrance as this offers full access to all. As the car park to the rear of the hospital offers disabled parking but the distance to the main hospital is lengthy and depending on route includes stairs.  You also have a large drop off area outside the main entrance this is excellent especially at busy times when car park is full. Toilets vary depending on where you are in the hospital on wards they can be tight to negotiate and then the other toilets in the hospital can be ok. Some offer better access than others. However the red cords in most of the toilets are tied up.
monks cross shopping park york,positive,"There are 2  disabled toilets located where the information centre is, tucked away in the corner of the park next to New look. The toilets have plenty of room for a carer and are to a high standard of cleanliness. They also have grab rails fitted and an emergency pull cord.  My only criticism would be that there should be another toilet on the other side of the park as it would be rather a long way if there was an urgent need for the toilet. Please note there are also disabled toilets in Asda (on the other side of the park) and also in the cafes on site."
monorail music glasgow,negative,"Pretty much city centre, just off the Merchant City. Carpark is pretty much right beside it. About a 15min walk from Queen Street station Need to check. "
monsal trail bakewell,negative,Accessible loo at station tea room. Accessed from platform. Good size. However I’m afraid it’s not well equipped with grab rails. Some will cope (I used to)but I find it too difficult to use now.
monsal trail bakewell,positive,Will need car. Blue badge spaces. Free at time of writing.
mont saint michel tourist information centre beauvoir,negative,parked in disabled car park nearest visitor centre difficult to find
montacute house montacute,positive,"We went by car. There is ample disabled parking close to the entrance, though the overall car park is limited. Accessible loo was well signed. Fully equipped, but not large enough to enable the mobility scooter to be turned. Grab rails provided but the toilet itself was ‘normal’ height."
monte feliz bahia feliz,negative,"There were no disabled toilets anywhere in the hotel besides the toilets in the rooms and they were not very wheelchair accessible as there were no railings so it was vey hard for me to use the toilets. Also, the shower was very difficult to use as the shower was in a bath so I slipped several times.  "
montjuic cable car barcelona,positive,A stop on the bus tour 
moonfish cafe aberdeen,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. The restaurant is in Correction Wynd, which is just off Union Street. Union Street is very well served by wheelchair accessible buses. The cafe is best approached by heading down St Nicholas Street (pedestrianised) and turning left into Correction Wynd."
moor hall hotel spa sutton coldfield,negative,"Nice disabled toilet, but not that big, but you can turn around in there. "
moor hall hotel spa sutton coldfield,positive,"Reasonable sized car park, with two disabled bays, and easy to push along to hotel entrance."
moorlands nature reserve york,negative,"The wood is down a single track road. Parking is on the side of the road but there is ample space, even when busy. However, cars park close together and there are not marked spaces so you may struggle to have enough room if you need to get a wheelchair etc out of the boot.  Parking is by the side of the road, there are no disabled priority spaces."
moorlands nature reserve york,positive,Parking is by the roadside outside the gate – there is space for about a dozen cars and the road is quiet so it was all perfectly easy.
moorpark cottages isle of lewis,positive,Parking outside the cottage with enough space for 2 cars. Ramp up to front door.
moors valley country park and forest ashley heath,negative,"Men's and Women's toilets have baby changing in them! Disabled toilet is huge and provides excellent manoeuvrability, but it does not require a RADAR key to access and it too has baby changing facilities. This means it is potentially open to abuse, it should also be noted that there is only a single disabled toilet at this main block. The toilet wasn't dirty as such, but it did need a good freshen up (this was at 10.15 am)."
moors valley country park and forest ashley heath,positive,There is a separate area for blue badge disabled parking. This area is not monitored though and is open to abuse. Whilst at the park I witnessed 3 non-blue badge holders parking in these spaces. This really lets down a very good provision for the disabled.
moray art centre forres,positive,"There is plenty of parking available onsite, it is generally quite quiet so there should be no problem parking next to the venue. If that is full, there is ample parking just behind it.  There are buses travelling to Findhorn from Inverness, Aberdeen and points in between but there would be a 4 to 5 minute walk to the Art Centre from the main road.     It was clean and spacious with grab rails but I could not see a red cord."
moray waste busters forres,negative,No toilets as far as I'm aware.
morecambe promenade morecambe,positive,Sufficient disabled spaces in the arp ark. Several parking spaces on the stretch of Prom towards Heysham. Prom parking there is exclusively for blue badge holders. Well equiped
morecambes festival market morecambe,positive,"The parking was situated directly outside the market and also across the road in another retail park area. The car park had multiple disabled bays and there were zebra crossings and safe places to cross as so to access the market.  The are two different disabled toilets within the festival market, one could be opened with a radar key and the other opened with a key that you needed to get from the market office within office hours.  The toilets were clean and spacious and included a working hoist and a changing bed. The toilets had alarm system and guides for people to use the hoists. "
morels restaurant luxury apartments keswick,negative,Not completely sure but we parked on the road using the blue badge which worked
morels restaurant luxury apartments keswick,positive,Accessible - easy to find Arrived in car.  Parked outside with blue badge.  Car park nearby.
morning coffee afternoon tea york,positive,"On street parking, on a busy main road. spacious toilets with room although no red cord."
morrisons airdrie,positive,"The car park provides approximately eighteen blue badge parking spaces which are situated not too far from the front door.  Depending on where you park you do need to use part of the road in the car park to get to the safe crossing area at the front of the store.  You can also access Morrison's from the main road if travelling by bus, please check with your local service to see if disability access is available on this route.  The bus stops are on both sides of the road, the stop on the opposite side of the road is near a pedestrian crossing.  Once you have crossed the road both are a short distance to the access ramp.  The access ramp has a Z shape allowing a gradual decline, however maybe challenging to get to the top in a self-propelled wheelchair.   There is also a taxi pick up and drop off area right outside the entrance of the store. "
morrisons cafe glasgow,negative,"The toilets are at the back of the cafe, you have to be able to get past both the queue of people getting served, and a row of tables on your other side. Bit of a tight squeeze!  There are two toilets, both of which are accessible but are also intended for all customers to use. Therefore there was a queue to use them - which is ok if you are able to wait. The toilet had accessible features, but wasn't really that user friendly. The emergency cord was wrapped round the raised grab-bar and tied together, meaning neither of these things could be used. The toilet -roll dispenser was empty and the container was lying open (so was in the way). There were spare toilet rolls sitting on the back of the toilet, which were fine for people with good mobility to reach, however as this was an accessible toilet would have been out of the reach of many. A little bit more awareness would mean these things could easily be improved."
morrisons cafe glasgow,positive,"Right next to all the public transport: Partick train station is to one side, and the  bus station is directly opposite. Partick is one of the main train stations, and one where you can change lines etc. The underground station is within the same building. So it is a bit of a transport hub.  There is also a car-park, but this tends to be quite busy."
morrisons cafe inverness,negative,The accessible loo is quite spacious but not always that clean. There is no changing places toilet. There is a large baby changing room which is sometimes cleaner.
morrisons cafe inverness,positive,"There's plenty of disabled parking close to the entrance and there is no height restriction meaning that large WAVs and Minibuses can use it too, which is handy as it is situated next to the Eastgate Shopping Centre but it's worth noting that there is a 3 hour maximum time limit."
morrisons cafe johnstone,positive,"Plenty of disabled parking spaces close to entrance at Napier Street.   Also disabled spaces at entrance at Collier St with walkway over River and lift down to access.  Johnstone train station a good 15 minute walk.  No 38 b bus stops at Houston Square 5 minite walk via Collier street. The disabled toilet is located next to entrance to Café, on walkway in front of tills. There is plenty room to manoeuvre, grabs rails and emergency alert cord.   The toilet is freshly decorated and clean."
morrisons derby,negative,Public transport is limited.  Disabled parking available but I've noticed that they have put a garden centre on the ones closest to the door since I last went. The bays are also really old and the markings are wearing off. 
morrisons dereham,positive,Parking is first rate here. Lots of disabled spaces very close to the store and I have rarely been unable to get a space on my first attempt.
morrisons dumbarton,negative,"Disappointed when saw the shop has been refurbished, to find the toilets could still use some improvements. The actual decor is modern and in-keeping with the other toilets.   The toilets are on left side just as you enter the store.   The accessible toilet has good signage including one which says that not every disability is visible.  The toilet is not that large, but was also cluttered, and when I was there, quite untidy with toilet roll on the floor.   It has a red cord but this is short and  does not go near the floor - it now sports a Euans Guide card!   The toilet has a fold down support bar to the left (if on the toilet) and fixed wall bar to the right.   The flush is a sensor but is in quite an awkward place, between the toilet and wall meaning you have to reach across toilet.   On the plus side, the baby change facilities are in a separate place.   "
morrisons dumbarton,positive,"The store has a large (free) car park immediately outside, which includes a number of marked disabled bays. It is all on one level, with flat entrance to shop.   The nearest train station is Dumbarton Central.  Dumbarton East train station is also nearby but note that this is not accessible for anyone using a wheelchair or with mobility difficulties.   There are buses servicing the area. "
morrisons edinburgh,negative,The toilet is at the furthest end of the supermarket. I would say it meets minimum requirements for design  but is let down by red cord 300mm from ground and side transfer space blocked by bins. 
morrisons edinburgh,positive,"Very large car park with designated disabled parking, fuel station with LPG provision, fully accessible.  Bus services are Lothian 4, 5, 26, 42, 45, 49 and East Coast 7, 124., both stops are adjacent to the store on east and west bound sides, there is a crossing nearby.  Fully equipped, accessible and well serviced. Good accessible parking near the entrance.  I got the bus, Lothian Buses 5, 15, 26 go right outside and the 44, 45 go round the corner on Willowbrae Road. Decent accessible toilet.  close and plenty. lots of parking that is close to the shop and is flat and easy to go from the spots to either. only one toilet but was clean and had many ramps and much space. Large car park with a number of designated disabled bays.  The number 3, 8, 29, 400, N3 buses all stop on Gilmerton Road where the store is located and only a short walk off the main road  Fully accessible, plenty of room and clean Can't fault it, really. Plenty of parking, and lots of buses stop nearby. I didn't use the primary accessible loo, but I was impressed to see in the ladies that one of the cubicles has been converted to be more accessible - it has grab rails inside and the door opens outwards instead of inwards. It would be a tight squeeze to fit a second person inside though, and there's no indication outside that these facilities are there, which is a shame! You can arrive by car and park in adjacent Blue Badge parking, get a bus to the Gyle or use the tram. A good accessible loo is available just inside the entrance to the store. Disabled parking is right outside the store entrance. The 27 and 5 buses stop very nearby but watch for the accessible pedestrian entrance to the store from the road as it is not quite where you would expect. It is a bit away from the traffic entrance. Not far enough to be a problem, unless the weather was really awful, which it can be up there! Accessible loo with the other toilet facilities - near the café."
morrisons elland,positive,Undercover parking this is amazing if the weather is bad  No issues and a separate changing room for kids 
morrisons harrogate,positive,The venue had disabled parking straight outside of the main entrance. The parking was easy to identify and had large and practical spaces. The store had accessible bus routs nearby as well as local taxi services which operate in the area who have wheelchair accessible vehicles.  Easily signposted on entrance to the store. 
morrisons hunters tryst edinburgh,negative,"There are 21 spaces in the car park.  The bus stop is near by. No dropped kerbs near the bus stop The number 5 bus and 27 bus stop at this stop.  When walking there is a ramped access , a big hill and you have to cross the road."
morrisons hunters tryst edinburgh,positive,The toilets are the front door. They are easy to get into. They smell nice.
morrisons kirkcaldy,negative,I have reported the red cord in the loo for being lopped off three feet from the floor but nothing gets done.  Euan's cards have been removed from cord on a few occasions. Today I filled in a complaint form. We will see what happens. It is a pity because the loo is otherwise good. See photos v
morrisons kirkcaldy,positive,Lots of blue badge spaces by entrance. 
morrisons lichfield,negative,"Hard to get in as door does not open fully.  Only 1 grey bin not suitable for incontinence pads.  The support bar is broken and falls down on you. Sink is too small, cannot manoeuvre wheelchair to use sink and dryer. And this is since they adaped it. "
morrisons ross on wye,positive,"As a supermarket, there was of course lots of parking and disabled bays. There were no steps to get to the loos."
morrisons york,positive,There is  a large carpark for customers travelling by car this includes disabled parking spots in close proximity to the entrance of the shop. There is a bike rack for cyclists and taxis pull up just outside the entrance of the shop.  There is a wide pathway for  pedestrians with textured paving in front of crossings for people with visual impairments. The toilets are located in the cafe section of the shop. there are male and female disabled toilets and baby changing facilities available. There was plenty of disabled parking spaces available. Level access disabled toilet. Morrison’s offer many disable parking places for those with blue badges closest to the front entrance of the building. The closest bust stop is just to the side of Morrisons which is around a 5 minute walk from the front entrance.   The toilets are level access with a disabled toilet  
mortons coffee lounge pitlochry,positive,"There are bus stops on the main street. We parked in the council car park on the right as you come into Pitlochry. The paths are narrow but otherwise not problematic The toilet is accessible and through one door whete there are seats as there is just one toilet. It is quite big, I could turn around in my powerchair and theres space at the right side of the toilet. There were grab rails. The floor was quite wet and there was a wet floor sign. It was otherwise clean and tidy"
mortons house hotel corfe castle,positive,"Although better than many hotels, needs increased provision for disabled parking.  Excellent - only remember to ask them for handrails if you need them."
morts wine bar walton on thames,positive,Double yellow lines all around the bar. Car park behind which is free for blue badge holders 
mosel hotel hahn koblenz,negative,Loo is low and in a compact en suite bathroom with no wheelchair access.
mosel hotel hahn koblenz,positive,Hotel had its own free car parking for guests.
moses gate country park bolton,negative,the disabled toilet is the ladies you do not need a radar key. it is very basic and quick dirty as there is only one for the whole park but its big enough to get my wheelchair in and does the job
moses gate country park bolton,positive,really easy
moss bank park bolton,positive,The car park was full but we managed to get good parking on the road just near it i did not use the toilt but they did have one near the new cafe
motel one edinburgh princes edinburgh,positive,"Walking, well wheeling, along from Princes Street you pass the Apple Store and go 50 metres along a side street. Here the hotel is signposted and automatic doors take you into a lobby area.  There is an accessible parking bay opposite the front entrance, on the street, for use by Blue Badge holders. Other parking is some distance and situated at Waverley Railway Station or the St. James Shopping Centre. There is a good accessible toilet off the lounge / bar area. With enough space for me and a PA. I travel by public transport so the location was ideal. Princes Street is well served by buses to loads of destinations, a railway station across the road from the hotel and a tram stop just around the corner in St Andrew Square. There was an accessible toilet by the bar and lounge area."
motel one edinburgh royal edinburgh,positive,"The hotel is only five minutes from the railway station at Waverley. It’s also next door to the airport bus services as well as taxi ranks. There was a very modern and spacious accessible toilet next to the reception area. The hotel is in a very busy part of the town so parking is limited. There is some limited on street parking in Market Street. There is a car park at nearby Waverley Station where cars can be parked for a longer duration.  For public transport, particularly the railway, the hotel is in a great location. Only five minutes from the station there’s no need for a taxi! The hotel is close to Princes Street where you can get a host of buses and also the tram service. The accessible toilet by the reception was simply mazing! An automated door to get in with touch pad entry, bags of space and wonderful fixtures and fittings."
motherwell railway station motherwell,positive,"trains run regular to here from Glasgow and bus stop outside of the station, I dont know about Car Park "
moto exeter,negative,The toilet is fitted suitably for most disabled needs and it was reasonably clean. The floor was wet due to a dripping tap. The door was difficult to manouver and latch. These toilets have not been substantially improved for 25 years and look very uninviting. As usual these days it seems people with small children are more deserving than disabled when it comes to be nearest to the entrance.
moto exeter,positive,Disabled bays
motorpoint arena cardiff,negative,"Across the road you can park at the St David's Centre which has a great changing places toilet. Plenty of parking spaces,  but you pay full place and its up three floors. There is often a long wait for the lifts. Don't go if you suffer from vertigo as you have to corkscrew round and round for ages to get to the first(3rd) parking floor. Not sure as didn't see them, but was told there was a disabled toilet. Use the excellent ones across the road in St David's Centre. parked in the John Lewis car park didn't use the toilet so can't really comment "
motorpoint arena nottingham nottingham,negative,Very few spaces so get there early!!!
motorpoint arena nottingham nottingham,positive,changing places!!
mount edgcumbe house and country park torpoint,positive,We went by private car and parked in the disabled spaces.  Nice and wide
mount kilimanjaro arusha,negative,"The toilets ranged from a shed with a 'drop-toilet' which are not easy for females particularly and even harder when you struggle to 'squat' to the toilet tents erected by Ahsante. These are portaloos and do flush and you can sit, (luxury) with a sigh of relief. I struggled with the pull flush lever as my stumps were too chunky but a nice porter was always looking out for me to do it for me (lid down , no nasty job really!)"
mount kilimanjaro arusha,positive,Easy and large parking area 
mount pleasant hotel malvern,negative,"Very few spaces on private hotel car park, all other parking is on the streets. It’s situated on a slope, with narrow bays.  We could not find toilets on the levels we viewed."
mount stuart house rothesay,positive,"Accessible parking is near to the Visitor Centre entrance. Once tickets are purchased the staff ring through the house staff and warn them you are coming. You can then drive to the house, as opposed to using the normal shuttle bus service, where the staff let you in at a separate entrance. Superb accessible loo in the courtyard, by the tearoom. Modern. Loads of grab rails. A choice of paper towels or air dyer (dryers are a bugbear of mine as they are often useless at actually drying hands).  The best bit was that there was plenty of space to turn my scooter so I could drive out of the loo, instead of having to reverse as is often the case."
mount stuart isle of bute,positive,There are a number of parking spaces reserved for disabled.  Also if you have a blue badge you can drive upto the house or use the shuttle bus. although this doesn't take wheelchairs.
mountainhall treatment centre dumfries,positive,"Dedicated accessible parking at the door Public transport bus stop in front of building I travelled by wheelchair taxi, but plenty of dedicated accessible parking near the main entrance. There is a regular public bus service to the treatment centre , with a dedicated bus stop within the grounds  Was advised in the eye clinic not to use the accessible toilet in outpatients as there was not room for a wheelchair! There is an accessible toilet off the main foyer, plenty of room etc. Only fault I would point out is that the toilet has only one grab rail at the side, and I need 2 to push myself up. There was one against the wall which wasn’t much good"
movenpick resort spa sowayma,positive,"We had a car and driver. Parking was provided and a drop off service was available. All guests have to go through security checks. These are tailored to guests' disability e.g. wheelchair user does not go through the scanner. Grab rails, raised loo, plenty of room for a wheelchair. Cleanliness was excellent."
moxy birmingham nec birmingham,negative,"The nearest disabled parking is alongside hotel, but it on a first come first saved basis, and if full, you would need to find another car park, and although not to far away, it’s a nuisance, so bear this in mind.  It’s £10 a night at the moment."
moxy birmingham nec birmingham,positive,"Bit of a ride to get to public disabled toilet, but it’s quite ok for you, with grab rails and pull cord, roomy and very clean"
moxy southampton southampton,negative,"Parking was in the nearby public carpark, were able to drop off/pick up just outside the hotel on the yellow lines but the road was quiet."
moxy southampton southampton,positive,"The hotel room bathroom was well designed with grab rails and a roll in shower. There was a small incline into it from the bedroom, manageable on my own or with a push from my husband. Didn't look if there was an accessible loo in the public area but expect there was."
mrs greens tea lounge dumfries,negative,"Quite reasonable accessible toilet, I have seen a lot worse.  Clean and bright but need to widen gap to allow wheelchairs to access toilet."
mrs greens tea lounge dumfries,positive,"Three accessible parking bays close by, (70 yards) as well as a disabled drop-off point 50 yards away 7 Accessible parking bays, and one drop-off point within 60 metres, bus stops approximately 120 metres.   Railway station approximately 1 mile. Plenty of room in the accessible toilet.   Emergency pull cord on the open side of toilet.   It is a bit tight for a wheelchair to mover from the table to the toilet but staff are happy to move tables slightly if necessary."
ms bank arena liverpool,positive,No issues with parking. Plenty around and can park at the Albert Dock a short walk away. Plenty accessible toilets at venue with turning space and grab rails. No changing places in venue but I believe there is one next door that can be used.
ms foodhall oban,positive,There are four disabled bays by the shop entrance. These had plenty of space to get a wheelchair out of the car with dropped kerbs.  There is an accessible toilet in the store on the left of the shop entrance. It was clean and well sign posted. 
muddy boots balmalcolm,positive,"Excellent parking; plenty spaces immediately outside the main entrance. Clean, accessible facilities in close proximity to cafe and shop. Plenty of parking with several well marked disabled parking bays right outside the door and level access. Access by public transport would be difficult though due to the busy road at the nearest bus stop in Balmalcom and the potholed farm track from the bus stop to the cafe/shop. There is a very good dual sided disabled accessible toilet with space for a carer. Separate toilets for children and baby changing area. Very clean "
muffin break aberdeen,positive,"The nearest bus station was at Union Square, not too far from Muffin Break The loo was fairly easy to find. It was clean and had rails fitted into the walls."
muffin break chester,positive,Plenty parking  is available for blue badge holders at Frodsham Street Car Park through the shopmobility scheme.  This is in the centre of Chester. A 10 minute walk away from this cafe. Flat walk.
muffin break stirling,positive,In a shopping centre with car park and bus station attached.  Easy access but red cord tied up. Left a free the red cord card. Space to transfer if required. 
mugdock country park craigend,positive,"There are disabled spaces near to the visitor centre and also directly outside the garden centre. There are disabled toilets in the gents, in the ladies and specially designated one in the courtyard.  Room to also have a carer with you if required."
muiravonside country park whitecross,positive,"Main carpark at Newparks Farm has disabled bays, can also drive  to disabled bays at cafe /playpark."
muircot farmshop tillicoultry,positive,"One disbaled space at the door but a spacious carpark. If on wheels you should be dropped off at the door as the acrpark is gravel. Not on any public transport route but could possibly walk from Coalsnaughton bus stop on route 52. Spacious, a free hanging read cord, smooth sliding door, space to transfer. COuld only be improved by an easier door from the restaurant to the toilet coridor. "
muji london,negative,"The nearest tube station is Sloane Square, which is not step-free, but does have escalators from the westbound (but NOT the eastbound) platform to street level, so if you can get out of your wheelchair and take it up an escalator, this station may be an option. Loads of buses go along the King's Road. I wouldn't attempt to park nearby. Tottenham Court Road tube station is the nearest step-free station: step-free street to train (Northern Line), step-free street to platform (Central Line, and manual boarding ramps are available). Be sure to check online that the extremely unreliable lifts at this station are working before you set off on your journey, and expect difficult interactions with unhelpful staff if you need a manual boarding ramp for the Central Line.   Many bus routes pass the shop. Many bus routes will drop you off very near the shop. There are no step-free stations nearby. Tottenham Court Road Station, which is very nearby, may be step-free as early as 2017."
muncaster castle ravenglass,positive,Disabled parking in coach park area. Plenty of spaces Only used one disabled toilet which was large enough to drive in and out on the scooter
munchies of leisureland paisley,negative,There was no immediate parking at venue as it is on the Main Road.  There is a public car park round the corner with a slight incline to reach venue.  Bus stops located at Paisley Museum which is a short walk away.  Paisley Gilmour street  train station is about half a mile away. 
munich airport munich,positive,"From aircraft to terminal no issues, lengthy but moving walkways, small trams to terminalsall on on one deck level."
munros nurseries inverness,positive,We didn’t use the toilets this time but have in the past had to try make do in the standard accessible toilet - my brother is a changing places toilet user and there isn’t one here. We have always found the accessible toilet to be clean. 
muriels kitchen london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby, though Tottenham Court Road station should be step-free some time in 2016. Several bus routes will drop you nearby in Shaftesbury Avenue or Charing Cross Road."
muriels kitchen london,positive,"The accessible toilet is brilliant. There are a few minor gripes about it though. (1) A table and chairs are placed right in front of the door. Staff have to move diners to allow access to the toilet. How silly. (2) The red emergency cord had been tied up around a grab-rail, putting it out of reach of anyone who might fall to the floor. (3) The toilet is kept permanently locked and staff have to open it with a coin to let you in. Take a coin to the toilet with you to force the lock."
murrayfield ice rink edinburgh,negative,There is a loo but the doors are difficult to open without help.
murrayfield ice rink edinburgh,positive,"Parking immediately outside and lots of buses nearby, including the very frequent 26. It's a short distance - around 200m - from the nearest bus stop. There is plenty of parking outside but didin't notice if there were any dedicated Blue Badge parking spaces."
musee des beaux arts de nice nice,positive,"The museum is located on a hilly road. The bus number 38 from Nice town centre stops almost outside and from there it is a short, slight downhill walk, see photos. The bus is a small, hopper type bus rather than a regular bus. However it does have a wheelchair space. By this route the only steps are the ones at the museum entrance, see below.  Alternatively you can take the newly opened tram Line 2 to Centre Universitaire Méditerranéen. This stop is step free access to street level. From the tram stop however there is a flight of stairs with a handrail, then a road to cross, then another flight of stairs with handrail to the museum grounds, see photos.   I travelled to the museum by bus on my way there, as I had an old guide book that didn't have information about the trams. I then asked at the museum and the staff told me bout the tram, so I took the stairs down to the tram and found that do-able, but it would have been very tiring for me to go up the 2 staircases. "
musee ernest cognacq saint martin de re,positive,The museum is opposite the bus stop for Saint Martin de Re Le Port.  There is a lift to the 2 accessible toilets in the basement. The toilets both had one grab rail and no emergency alarm.
musee massena nice,positive,"The museum faces the Promenade des Anglais and there is a step entrance to the gardens from there. There are a number of buses that drive along the sea front and top nearby. In the basement, which is accessible by lift, there are 2 accessible toilets, labelled handicapes. The accesible toilet was clean and spacious with a single grab rail and no emergency alarm."
musee matisse nice,positive,"The museum is in Cimiez, a hilly area of Nice, just north of the main tourist area. It is easily accessible by public transport. I had an old guide book so the bus it recommended no longer ran there.  From the centre of Nice a bus number 15 takes you to the entrance of the park which houses the museum. The bus is quite regular and is step free with a wheelchair space.  I picked up the bus from Rue Gioffredo. The bus took about 10 minutes to get there. The route goes up quite steep hill and the stop before is called Victoria, and is almost opposite the Regina Building, a large white building on your left as you go up the hill. The museum bus stop is called Matisse / Arènes. Just passed the bus stop on the right is the entrance to the park, with a single step through a gate into the park. On the gate is a blue sign with a wheelchair user symbol, an arrow pointing left and wording saying that the PMR (People with mobility restrictions) is 100m away, see photo. Following the sign and walking round the corner to the other entrance, which is step free and also gated. While there is a sign on this gate to the Matisse Museum there is no information here about an accessible entrance, see photo.  There was an accessible toilet on Level 1, next to other toilets. The accessible toilet was spacious, it had a single grab rail, space under the sink and no emergency cord, see photo. It was clean."
musee rodin paris,negative,Not sure really as we came on foot from our hotel
museo reina sofia madrid,positive,Clean and spacious - the loo itself was in the corner so you would have had to transfer one way.
museum de heksenwaag oudewater,negative,There is no accessible toilet at this site.
museum of asian art corfu,positive,"Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced. There is an accessible toilet, which was spacious, clean and with grab rails. the flush for the toilet is on the right grab rail. Apart from at Corfu Airport this was the only accessible toilet I saw during my week's holiday."
museum of childhood edinburgh,negative,"Limited parking on the Royal Mile. There are bus stops on the Royal Mile outside the museum, but if you plan on driving there are no spaces immediately nearby. The street outside is busy. There's a taxi rank on the Royal Mile and on North Bridge. The toilet I saw was very spacious and certainly room for a wheelchair and carer, if required.  I was interested to see the emergency pull cord appeared to be missing. There wasn't one there, but it looked like the fitting for one was on the ceiling. I'm not sure if it had somehow been accidentally pulled out? There was a button alarm on the wall."
museum of comedy london,positive,"Took a black cab to get there. I used one provided by the MS society and he dropped us right outside the venue. I was able to use a ramp to step out  onto the kerb.  The ramp was put down manually which takes a bit of time. Always need help in plugging in my seatbelt for some reason but he did help with this. I couldn’t see any disabled parking nearby and as this is the west end I would advise getting a cab as the walk will be too far from Tottenham Court Road tube, which is near to the venue. The loo was very visible, clean, spacious enough for a wheel chair, with grab rails and just enough space for a carer .... with a bit of a squeeze for the larger person/chair."
museum of free derry londonderry,negative,"We came on foot/wheels from Bogside, the area has flush drop kerbs and - I found - generally comfortable access all around. There is parking outside but unsure on times or limits in place. Also not sure about public transport."
museum of free derry londonderry,positive,Nice big clean modern accessible loo with all the rails I needed. The accessible toilet is to the left of the reception desk. No access key or pin required. Handrails are on both side and space under the sink to roll under. Signage is clear for the toilets
museum of lincolnshire life lincoln,negative,2/3 Blue Badge parking spaces outside the main entrance. If no spaces then its Street parking off the main road
museum of lincolnshire life lincoln,positive,Clean and spacious - could do with a more powerful hand dryer
museum of london docklands london,negative,"Used public transport Docklands Light Railway. The lift takes you to the pavement level and you walk past about 4 dock buildings on smooth surface to the museum. The front of the museum is cobble stones. All level access. Toilets on all floors (so when everyone is using the ones by the cafe, use the lift and the toilets are opposite them on floor 3) . Entrance (ground floor) toilets have baby changing both in and outside the accessible toilet). These toilets have an inner room area that leads to the accessible toilet (some with and some without a door between them). The toilets wouldn't meet all recent criteria but had a cistern shelf, emergency cord and full compliment of support rails. Photo of the third floor toilets. Clean and reasonable floor grip."
museum of london docklands london,positive,"The Museum is in London's Docklands and the nearest station is West India Quay which is on the Lewisham branch of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR). Other nearby DLR stations are West Ferry and Canary Wharf. All of which have lift access from platform to street. There is also a separate Canary Wharf tube station on the Jubilee Line, with lift access. On my way there I exited at West Ferry station and on my way back I went from West India Quay. Having used both stations I would say.  West India Quay is the nearest station, with about 2 - 3 minutes walk on a pedestrianised walkway to the museum and by using this route you navigate less cobblestone.   With both routes signage to the museum is poor. The museum is housed in a row of warehouses which also houses a number of restaurants and it's not clear where the museum entrance is until you get nearer to it.  West Ferry is about a 5 - 6 minute walk to the museum and the route is less straight forward. I did not see signage to the museum. However, there was a map and I worked out a route . When I arrived at Hersmere Road I was facing the rear of the museum. There was a large museum banner but the only entrance was for staff. It wasn't clear if I needed to turn right or left to get to the museum.  From this route there are a few more cobblestones to navigate than coming from West India Quay Station. I only used the ground floor accessible toilet. The door is  labelled. However it consists of two rooms. The first has a baby changing table and you have to walk through this to get to the accessible toilet. The layout is not ideal. The accessible toilet itself was clean, with grab rails and emergency cord.  The nearest step-free station is Canary Wharf (Jubilee) or Heron Quays (DLR). From there it's a short distance to the museum. It's not very well signposted and you may have to ask passers-by for help with navigation. At least two sets of really good accessible toilets.   One star lost because someone had 'tidied' the red emergency cord away onto a shelf area a metre and a half above the ground. This is so silly: the cord should hang all the way down to the ground so that it can be pulled by anyone who falls over, for example during the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet."
museum of london london,negative,"Only used the downstairs one. Small with a bin taking up all of the transfer space. Entrance and exit was a bit tricky with little turning space. All support rails were present, No key needed. Very noisy inside."
museum of london london,positive,"The Museum of London is located near St Paul's Cathedral. The nearest tube station is St Paul's, which does not have step free access. The nearest accessible station is Farringdon. There are lots of buses that stop nearby.  The Museum is on a pedway, an elevated pedestrianised walkway. There are a number of lifts which can be used to access the pedway and from there is level access to the museum. The location of the lifts are signposted but it can be a bit tricky to find. Occasionally lifts are  out of order and when this happens the nearest working lift is not signposted. I had this problem yesterday. I entered the pedway from the Barbican by lift. I had planned to exit by the lift at Wood Street. When I got there the lift was out of order but I used the escalator instead. I used the accessible toilet near the entrance. They were spacious and clean. There are grab rails and an emergency cord reached to the floor but was tucked behind the baby changing facility, see photo. The museum does have a small number of parking spaces for blue badge holders that can be booked in advance. Each floor had an accessible toilet. Large, clean and modern. We used trains and buses to right outside the museum ( accessed by lift then a walk on a raised pathway to the entrance). "
museum of oxford oxford,positive,"No specific parking but there are disabled bays in town. Check the Council website. You can park in residents' only spaces if you have a blue badge. It is right next to some bus stops. There are 2 large, clean accessible loos, on the cafe level and on the ground floor."
museum of photography charles negre nice,positive,"The museum is just off the c, the main square in Vieux Nice (the Old Town). Buses and trams stop in the vicinity but it will involve a short walk. Approaching from the sea front is a level walk. In there larger building, on the ground floor in the first room just behind the stairs there was the entrance to the toilets. Once going through the door there was a sink and 2 toilets cubicles, both had an accessible toilet with single grab rail, small sink, spacious but no emergency cord.   There were no toilets in the smaller building of the museum."
museum of the jewellery quarter birmingham,positive,I went by train into Birmingham Newstreet station Network railway assistants are some of the best for getting me on and off the train. I came out of station and then got tram from right outside station and this takes you straight to Jewelery Quarter and its about two minutes away from station. There are lifts to street level I am sorry do not know about car parking. I am sorry did not use these facilities 
museum of the university of st andrews saint andrews,positive,"St Andrews can be reached by the main roads A91, A917, and A915. The nearest railway station is Leuchars, 10.2 miles or 16km away, approximately 20 minutes by car. Accessible taxis can be booked in advance - contact Williamsons on 01334 476787. There is a regular bus service from Dundee via Leuchars station into St Andrews, Stagecoach route no.99 has low floor access, wheelchair access and Wi-Fi.

The no.92 bus goes from St Andrews bus station to North Street, which is 0.2 miles or 0.3km from MUSA. From North Street you can walk down Butts Wynd and MUSA is opposite at the end of the lane, on The Scores. Bus timetables can be found at https://www.stagecoachbus.com/timetables.   MUSA is situated on The Scores, set back from the road, with flat, paved access on a gentle downward slope from the street to the museum entrance. Parking is free on The Scores, which is one way. There is also free parking available at the North Haugh and West Sands car parks. Paid parking spaces are available in the town centre although on street parking is free for Blue Badge holders. There is a cobbled surface at the entrance to the carpark, between the street and the carpark, although there is a level tarmac section at the archway to the left of the car park entrance.  There are two accessible parking spaces in the car park at the front of the museum and level access from the car park to the museum entrance on a paved path. The museum carpark can be used for drop off before parking in the street  We parked nearby on street on The Scores on this visit. Toilets are signposted from reception. They were very clean and tidy. There is a unisex accessible toilet next to the reception plus separate male and female toilets. The accessible toilet includes both horizontal and vertical grab bars, and an assistance alarm through to museum reception. There are automatic sensors on the taps. The baby change table is incorporated in the accessible toilet. There is also one unisex (not accessible) toilet on the first floor. The toilets are lit by fluorescent lighting, activated by automatic motion sensor.   "
museum on the mound edinburgh,positive,"There is a Well-kept Accessible loo located beyond the gallery space. Being on the Mound, a busy and fairly steep hill, there's no nearby parking. You may be able to park in adjacent streets (200 m) with a Blue Badge. Buses, most are wheelchair accessible, do pass by the door and the nearest bus stops are within 100 m. An accessible toilet is available adjacent to the standard toilets. There are two doors to pass through and staff will help with these if required. All the features are at wheelchair height, it was very clean, and wide enough to turn a powerchair."
music room liverpool,negative,"Street parking,with disabled spaces nearby."
music room liverpool,positive,"Car park available with wide disabled bays. There are also some on street disabled bays.  Plenty of loos since the refurb. Roomy, clean and unisex.  "
musikverein vienna,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Karlsplatz U Bahn Station (fully accessible) is very close but the lift brings you out in what seemed like the wrong place. The safest route is to exit the station concourse in the direction away from the concert hall then turn left and walk through the gardens. Turn left into an underpass which takes you under the main road and you will find a lift that takes you up about 100 yards from the Musikverein, with no roads to cross."
musselburgh racecourse musselburgh,positive,"There is good public transport to the venue.  Easy access off the main road with large clear disabled signposts.  Parking on grass with very helpful parking attendants who would allow you to unload on to the hard surface if required.  Quite a considerable walk to the entrance if you are pushing a wheelchair or a bit unsteady on your feet but the surface is smooth and wheelchair friendly, as is the whole of the racecourse (no gravel in sight). There are 4 well equipped disabled toilets,  located throughout the racecourse with large clear signage, information boards display their locations.  The toilets are clean, spacious and will accommodate large wheelchairs, there are ample handles, rails etc. The access to all toilets is easy, exit and entrance."
muthu royal thurso hotel thurso,negative,"For rail travellers, this is not far from the station. Car parking doesn't seem to be a problem in Thurso. This hotel's entrance (stepped) is directly off an uneven pavement."
mv britannia southampton,negative,"Difficult to judge parking facilities at the terminal in Southampton as we came by accessible taxi, but there was parking directly outside the terminal building. Not sure how close by the bus service is."
mv britannia southampton,positive,"There were plenty accessible toilets onboard. Some were automatic sliding doors that you had to push the button to open/close/lock them, the others were just the normal manual doors. There was good space in each of them."
mv hjaltland aberdeen,positive,"We drove as we were taking the car onboard.  As we arrived a little early we popped into the multi storey carpark.  Not ideal as it cost a wee bit.  You queue on the road and once through the security bit, there is plenty space for waiting to get on board.  The guys in the ferry are great at directing you to a space depending on size of can and access needed.  Top tip is to put your hazards on as you enter the ship so they know you need assistance. The ensuite in the room, was bijou but had everything you need.  The toilet was a bit low for me, but saved by the commode style shower chair.    Didn't use any other toilet on board.  When we arrived in Aberdeen at the ferry terminal, there was plenty parking close by, although we were taking the car onboard the ferry so we were parked in the queue waiting to drive on board.  When collecting our tickets, if you’ve told them in advance you have accessible needs, they give you a notice to hang from your inside mirror that tells the staff directing you to board with your car that you need to be parked near to the lift that takes you up to reception. A helpful tip Would be, if you are a wheelchair user to also tell the staff directing you on board that you are a wheelchair user and you need extra space to vacate your car, or you need extra space behind to allow for your ramp or hoist etc, as they can sometimes cram the cars in and you are in with cars all around you before you know it. There is a train station approximately a 10 min walk from the ferry. I am unsure about the bus service as this was not used. The public toilets onboard were a good size and had grab rails either side. There were also accessible public shower rooms with roll in shower which had plenty of space. There is disabled parking at both ferry terminals (Aberdeen and Lerwick), but there is also a service that can let you park your car in the ferry and transport it to your destination. There are two disabled toilets that I seen on board the ferry. Both are large and have everything that I needed. I also noticed an untangled red cord which was nice."
mv hrossey lerwick,negative,I'm not sure what the parking facilities are like as we were dropped off at the Aberdeen terminal building entrance. I believe the train station is close by though. 
mv hrossey lerwick,positive,There was also an accessible toilet and shower room on the deck above the cabins. I didn't use the shower room as I was able to use the shower in our cabin but its great for people who haven't booked a cabin and want to freshen up.  
mv isle of mull ferry oban,negative,Any of the traffic we noticed were in fact  going on to the ferry however there is parking in the area. The train station is located next to the ferry terminal and the bus station area is about 10mins walk away. There was one accessibly toilet on the first level up from the car deck next to the shop near the stern of the vessel. This is the only toilet that did not have a step.  There were grab rails in place and the sink and hand dryer are in a good position. No red cord but a small rope used for the alert system sadly however this did not reach the floor and was partly encased in a tube for some reason.
mv loch bhrusda baile mor,negative,Disabled spaces in local car parks. Toilet easily accessed on board.
mv loch seaforth stornoway,positive,"Disabled passengers get to park their car beside the lift on board the ferry. Toilets on board are good. Just request special assistance and you are directed to a lane which ensures ready access to the lift This was the pleasant surprise. It was big, clean,  had rails and a changing places bed complete with a hoist and electrical controls."
mylor sailing school falmouth,negative,The public toilets are a short walk away. The only toilets were Public ones but unfortunately there was not a disabled one but we managed to find a disabled toilet in the Mylor Yacht Club just around the corner. My apologies now it has been mentioned I do remember some comment about a code but as I have memory problems forgot that Theres is one near the club Full disabled facilities 300m away at the yacht harbour there is a disable loo in the cafe. very clean but a little bit of a walk away from the sailing school.
mylor sailing school falmouth,positive,"Car park is at the venue, and staff give you a pass to park for free when you attend Sailability sessions.  Public paid car park next to Mylor Sailing which they have free parking passes for to be used by carers who bring disabled. There are a couple of car parks in the village in very close proximity and a car park at the sailing school it’s pay and display but you get a free permit if you’re using the sailability  A very short distance away 2 mins ? Very accessible clean and well maintained quite large and also has changing facilities and a shower Parking is in the pay-and-display harbour car park. The sailing school has passes to put in your car so you don't need to pay whilst you're with them. It gets busy in peak seasons but the sailing school will help you park if needed. The bays are narrow for access so if you can't park on the end of a row you may need to let passengers out and then park. We could park right outside the school.  We did call ahead to make sure and as long as they know you are coming they will save you a parking space. A little way over from the school but a very good facility.  A coded loo and so nice and clean.  Good access.  Entry door a little heavy but plenty of people around to hold this open. Having the ability to park the car using the permit from Mylor Sailing School was really helpful On site parking available Good quality approx 100m away Parking is on the flat with easy access to the water, either down a wide slipway and onto the wheelie boat through a bow door, or from a floating pontoon.     This is a small site and the loo is easily accessible. Parking can be very busy as it's a harbour and disabled parking is very limited however mylor sailability are always willing to help where they can  The sailing school provide free parking at the harbour although there is no specified disabled space   Nearby loo in local cafe, didn't use the public loos I didn't need this but it was available if required, and clearly explained in advance Very accessible We drove, and there are some disabled spaces, but it can get busy so it is best to get there early.  We were given a sign for our window enabling free parking when partaking in an activity. If it is busy, they will guide you to a parking place very close to the school. Parking on site is free  Ok but a bit of a walk  Free parking on site See above - Mylor arranged it and we parked right beside them. Flat surfaces. No problems.  We arrived by car - can't comment on public transport. The loo is some 400 yards away. Mylor gives you a code. There is a wheelchair accessible shower and loo in the same room - it was clean and had good griprails for the loo. (Didn't use the shower so can't comment). Best to visit beforehand as obviously a small boat has no facilities. Large car park with no disabled bay but club has sign for you car and don’t have to pay. If you find an end Bay you can use as no upstands in the way. These are some way from the club and need a 4 number code to access which the club will give you The parking is quite busy during the summer but the guys always manage to fit your car in. There is a lovely accessable cafe nearby and plenty of walking around on the beach and footpath."
nailcote hall hotel coventry,negative,"We did not see any disabled toilets, but ladies and gents are well equipped and roomy enough although you may wish to leave your chair in corridor. Only one bay is available, by entrance into hotel itself, while parking for this review is more difficult to say, as it can get a bit busy at times, and everyone seems to want to park up close to the path for the leisure centre, as it’s a bit of a way to get to the centre.  We found just ladies and gents, and you may have to leave your chair outside the toilet cubicles"
nailcote hall hotel coventry,positive,"A drive through countryside views will bring you to this lovely old Jacobean House, which has ample parking spaces, with just one disabled bay."
nailsea post office bristol,negative,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately 200m away on Station Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
nairn lochloy holiday park nairn,positive,We had our own private car park for our caravan which was very good and convenient. 
nairn seafront nairn,positive,"I have given the 5 stars for the parking as I have not experienced the public transport but Nairn is on the main bus and rail routes between Inverness and Aberdeen. Although there are frequent buses and trains, you would have to walk about half a mile from the train station to the walk and a quarter of a mile from the bus station.   There are several car parks right beside the walk and there is usually plenty of space as well as several disabled parking spaces. I have never had a problem parking. The accessible toilet was separate from the ladies and gents and needed a radar key to gain entry. It was close to the walk and easily accessed.  The inside was very clean and spacious with grab rails and handlebars but there was no red cord which was the reason I did not rate it 5 star. "
namco funscape trafford centre manchester,positive,Disabled Parking and public transport is excellent at the Trafford centre  Lots of accessible toilets in the Trafford centre but didn’t check changing places so not sure 
nandos dundee,positive,"There were a good number of disabled parking spaces at the side of the restaurant and a few stops in the park too The toilets are through a door which pushes im so then pulls to go back out, it was very difficult for me to open it due to the handle in particular. The accessible toilet was very clean and a good size, there was a stool in the corner which is good for parents who may need to sit while changing a baby, but it made it a little harder to turn round- though not impossible. There were a good number of grab rails and a red cord that hung to the floor"
nandos edinburgh,positive,"There is ample parking, including spaces outside the restaurant. The toilets are roomy, clean and easy to access. Spacious toilet with Radar key This retail and leisure complex is easy to find.  There are quite a few disabled parking spaces just 10 - 20 metres from the restaurant. Toilet has key access. The key is kept behind the service counter and is easy to get from staff. Best to be aware when you go to the restaurant as I went to the toilet and had to come back to the counter for the key. Would be helpful to have an info sheet on the tables for people with disabilities to tell them they need a key for the toilet and where to get it. Buses stop right in-front of the Fountainpark centre and there is underground parking. There is also a drop off area on the level.  RADAR key required. Very clean and quite spacious. Handrails close to toilet on left side but there is about two feet space between the toilet and wall and handrail on right hand side. Red cord hanging to floor on left hand side. Space under sink to roll under. Toilet roll dispenser is the single tissue dispenser which I had a bit of bother with but it was at an okay level for me. There is a hand dryer next to the door. Decent parking at Fountainbridge not sure where the accessible bays are, none at the near front. Lothian buses 1, 34, 35 go straight past and the 22 is a little walk away (about 4 minutes) at the bypass."
nandos glasgow,negative,There is not a car park for the restaurant however there is one near although is not easily accessible to the restaurant and can be a 5/10 minute walk.  Toilets are locate upstairs in the restaurant and so an individual must climb the large amounts of stairs. This is therefore not accessible for wheelchair users  close enough to the bus station and a train station but still at least a 10 minute walk from there. Both male and female toilets are downstairs and I do not think there is a disabled toilet on the ground level which is not useful to anyone in a wheelchair.
nandos newcastle upon tyne,positive,Good number of spaces in the Eldon Square Shopping Centre multi-storey car park with lift access for car park to Eldon Square Shopping Centre and then a short distance to the restaurant which is clearly signposted or can be found by asking staff. There is one accessible toilet on the first floor which is clean and well-maintained.
nandos ocean terminal edinburgh,negative,I was unable to use the toilet on my visit as there was something preventing the door from closing. I did mention this to a member of staff so I am hoping this is now resolved.
nandos ocean terminal edinburgh,positive,Ocean Terminal has ample parking.
nandos poole,positive,"Tower Park has a large number of disabled parking bays, but they are not monitored so are open to abuse. Large enough toilet, but like many restaurants it also has a baby changing area in it. It also has baby chairs outside the door. On my visit there was also an unused chair blocking the entrance!"
nandos rugby,negative,"Parking was s little tricky. Although there were plenty of disabled bays, it wasn't immediately obvious where they were, or how to get to the restaurant from the parking bays. It feels like they have compromised ease of use, for a quirky design layout for the mall. "
nandos rugby,positive,"Had everything I needed, although it was a little tight inside. I did have to untie the emergency pull cord, but didn't have a Euan's Guide card with me. Missed opportunity there!"
nandos york,negative,Nando's is located in the pedestrianised city centre. This means the nearest car park is quite far away. The streets can get very busy on the weekends which can be a hassle for wheelchair users. The majority of the streets are cobbled which restricts wheelchair users.
nandos york,positive,On the bottom floor there is a spacious disabled toilet that is easy to access as long as it isn't crowded with people.
nannys shop shieldaig,positive,Sheildaig is a small village in the Scottish Highlands so only accessible by car. Nanny's is a cafe right on the waterfront and there is parking right outside. There's no dedicated blue badge parking as such but you should be able to park close by. There's one loo at the back of the cafe & it's spacious with grab rails. Park right outside or across the road.
narcissus edinburgh,negative,Number 8 bus goes down and up Broughton Street regularly 
nardinis largs,positive,Nardini has its own car parking. Some of the spaces are a little tight and there weren't a lot of spaces when we were there but there is a much larger car park opposite on the other side of the road. Decent sized accessible loo with sliding door - clean and tidy. Star knocked off for a short red emergency cord which did not reach anywhere near the floor. 
nation of shopkeepers leeds,negative,Disabled parking is available outside the 02 academy which is about a 5 minute walk from this venue. 
nation of shopkeepers leeds,positive,There is a standard disabled toilet through double doors behind the bar. It does not require a radar key and has grab rails on either side of the toilet. 
national botanic garden of wales llanarthney,positive,Good approach close to main Swansea to Carmarthen road but you do need a car as there is no nearby railway station. Two disabled access loos with good space and very clean.
national bubblecar museum boston,negative,Poked our head into the accessible toilet. Definitely had a support rail on the wall side to the left and transfer space on the right which was not obstructed. We would have managed with a manual lift/drag.
national bubblecar museum boston,positive,Parking on a flat surface next to the door - it's the sort of museum you won't have to fight through the crowds to get into or for parking! It's out in the countryside so I don't think you can arrive by bus.
national civil war centre newark,positive,We went by WAV and parked on a street nearby. Pavements all good with dropped curbs and quite a lot of pedestrianised in the centre. There are three spaces outside the museum but suspect they are often full. Fifty yards down the road (away from town centre) is a good sized level access pay and display car park.  The disabled toilet is through the cafe (via a platfomr lift) and through a theatre entrance door and could be better signposted. Large toilet with grab rails and well looked after.
national coal mining museum for england wakefield,negative,"Car park on site.   Bus services run within easy walking distance of the Museum. From Wakefield or Huddersfield, the Yorkshire Tiger bus stops at the Reindeer pub with a few minutes walk to the Museum.   The nearest mainline railway station is Wakefield Westgate. It takes about 20 minutes for a taxi ride from the train station."
national coal mining museum for england wakefield,positive,"Accessible toilets are available in the museum and the cafe area. They were clean and tidy and nice and large.  There are many parking spaces for disabilities that are easily accessible at the rear entrance, facing the main door. There are large doors and hallways providing a spacious pathway for those who are disabled or require a little more support or room."
national glass centre sunderland,negative,I did not use the fascilities.
national ice centre nottingham,positive,We parked nearby on street parking but as we left we saw a very easy car park adjacent to the Ice Centre which wasn’t easily sign posted as we had driven past it twice. It’s a once way system around the Motorpoint arena which is what’s it’s called in addition to the NIC. Yay it has one of the best Changing Places I’ve ever seen. Clean new and staff directed me and knew exactly what it was. Large soft bed with all you could need. It’s on level three which is on a different level to the rink. The added bonus is you see the lovely ice dance costumes from Torvil and Dean Olympic Days as they decorate the walls in large glass frames on level 3.
national justice museum nottingham,negative,There is street parking. 
national justice museum nottingham,positive,No changing places but there are two reasonably sized accessible toilets available. There is a changing place a few minutes walk away near old Market Square that I know of.
national library of scotland edinburgh,negative,"Public transport is good, I don’t know where parking is available "
national library of scotland edinburgh,positive,"This is to the right hand side of ground floor. Lots of space for a powerchair / scooter and a companion. Handrails and red cord there, all great! A very good accessible loo with a surprising amount of space. Particularly liked the full length mirror.  Lever taps would be nice as the standard taps were hard to use. Everything you'd expect to find and clean and tidy. There was an accessible toilet next to the standard toilets. It has a wide door and plenty of space to get in and move around. Grab rails were in helpful places and the environment clean and tidy."
national maritime museum cornwall falmouth,negative,"Parked in public car pack outside. It was very busy and there weren't many disabled spaces, I saw 3 I think. We got the 3rd... but it was Cornwall in August.  There was quite a walk from the nearest parking bay across wheelchair-friendly open spaces to get to the museum."
national maritime museum cornwall falmouth,positive,"Didn't go in but just by the entrance door.  A modern building which looked as though it had taken disability access into account when designed, I would guess that the disabled loos were up to standard."
national maritime museum london,positive,"I travelled by public transport and the bus stop was opposite the entrance of the museum. There is a path through the grounds to the main entrance. There are some benches next to the path. The disabled accessible toilets were well signposted. The disabled toilet by the ground floor café was in use so I didn't use it so can't comment on the facilities. I used the main ladies toilets. To my delight/ surprise the toilet nearest the entrance was slightly wider than the others and had grab rails which made it easy for me to use. However it would not be suitable for a person in a wheelchair as it is too narrow and there is no sink inside. The museum has a car park, with some  blue badge spaces, which it is possible (and advisable) to book in advance by phone. The car park is a considerable distance from the main entrance to the museum, and some of the paths are gravelled, so may present some difficulty to wheelchair users. A bus route runs along the road at the front of the museum, and most London buses should be accessible. We found one accessible toilet near the information desk on the ground floor, and another on the mezzanine. The toilet on the ground floor seemed better designed, including fixed rail on the right and drop-down rail on the left, with space to side transfer. The accessible toilets have open access, not via RADAR key, and we experienced one of them being misused by able-bodied visitors. It is possible to pre book parking prior to your visit. Low floor buses run along the adjacent road. The accessible toilet I visited was modern, very spacious, well equipped and clean."
national media museum bradford,negative,There is a car park around the back and front of the museum. There are spaces specifically for blue badge holders which are located at the front of the museum with a maximum stay of 4 hours.
national media museum bradford,positive,"I traveled using the bus, the bus station was a 10 minutes walking distance. Finding a parking space can be stressful, however the National Media Museum provides parking spaces at front of the museum, with the maximum stay up to 4 hours, giving you plenty of time to explore the museum. Also provides  car and coach drop-off directly outside the entrance.   Easy access toilets are located on the Ground Floor, Levels 3 and 5, and in Pictureville Bar. Toilets are spacious so their is enough room for wheelchair uses. Also alarm cords and grab rails are available.    There are a number of easy access toilets available on the ground floor, level 3, 5 and the picture Ville bar with enough room to manoeuvre "
national memorial arboretum burton on trent,positive,"As there was plenty of room I forgot about disabled parking but the car park had a good level surface and was no great distance from the entrance. Fabulous, best and cleanest yet.  I was in the early stages of knowing what to look for so although I didn't note grab rails or pull cord they were definitely disabled loos and my wheelchair fitted inside."
national museum cardiff,positive,Free disabled parking available to rear of Museum approx 200m from front entrance via level pavements.  Required to collect an exit token from shop (show blue badge) which is a bit fiddly to handle. Changing places facilities and disabled toilets available but need to take lift to basement cafe to access. Additional accessible loo hidden away at back of 4th floor main gallery space - assistance needed to access two sets of doors and may be inaccessible at times when displays being changed.
national museum of flight east fortune,positive,"Getting to the Museum could be a challenge for some folk if using public transport. It's probably best to go by car if you can. When you arrive you get your ticket at the gate and they will give you a map. The Museum is quite spread out with lots of hangers, huts and buildings to explore. The map does show you the accessible parking bays which is helpful.  There were plenty of accessible toilets a different points during the walk around. All were well signposted, well equipped and spotlessly clean and tidy. I went in a car and it was easy to get to the front door from where we parked. There was ample disabled and a led parking and a shuttle bus to take diabled people to the main show ground. I am sure there are local buses that would take you to the museum too. We had fast track access thanks to a red badge that took us out the main line of traffic straight to the car park.  Lots and lots and lots of both able and disabled toilets and they were colour coded so you could spot them from a distance and they were all over so no dashing or waiting and stewards on hand to help   has a bus running to it lots of parking and is on the flat so ideal for all abilities and ages all the equipment needed for anyone to use There is a large car park with multiple disabled access bays close to the main hangars. A bus service (121) runs between Haddington and North Berwick Mon-Sat which takes you right into the museum. I saw numerous accessible loos throughout, and the one in the block I used was spacious with an emergency cord hanging all the way to the floor."
national museum of ireland   natural history dublin,negative,There is one wheelchair accessible toilet on the first floor it is easy to find and appropriately equipped and is also very clean and spacious.
national museum of scotland edinburgh,negative,"4 disabled spaces in street outside but very close to lots of main bus routes  On street parking infront of museum, no designated museum car park, so on busy days (bank holidays/weekends) finding a space may be a issue. Excellent. transport links are quite good as there are numerous buses that pass along the bridges eg. 5, 7, 35 etc. parking would be difficult though Only four spaces outside the Museum were Disabled Spaces - any they were all full. Fortunately we arrived reasonably early and use one of  the many other 'ordinary' spaces. Parked in disabled spot but there are very view available now. Access to museum is step free and there are lifts to upper levels If you find space, it is fine to get out and you can park really close. There are a few disabled parking spaces on the street. There are only four disabled parking spaces on Chamber Streets and they can't be pre-booked."
national museum of scotland edinburgh,positive,"Accessible parking is right outside the door in four marked bays. I arrived by bus in the adjacent street with a short wheel to the main entrance. Having a Changing Places loo was fabulous. No loo anxieties here! Good choice of accessible toilets which were clean Buses stop nearby. Accessible toilet and a Changing Places toilet, see photo. Brilliant. There are bays down the Centre day on either side of Chambers Street where the Museum is located, there are disabled bays and also blue badge consideration is given. The public bus service at either end of Chamber Street comes and goes from all areas of the City, including a service which is to and from the airport and links the Royal Yacht Britannia. Be mindful this area of the City is very congested and Park ng is at a premium especially in the summer and festival time. The toilets are more than numerous, clearly signed, fully appointed large and spacious, visited regularly for cleaning and servicing. They are Radar key accessible if preferred, suitably for all types of mobility access. On street parking on Chamber Street, can be slightly limited especially when busy. Best accessed by Lothian Buses - the 35 stops right outside the main entrance to the museum. Lovely wide paths and level entrance into building. Each floor had an easily accessd accessible loo - which was large and clean with no obstructions. Toilets were large and clean and with free hanging red cords. Very large toilet with grab rails . Also had a sanitary product machine which I’ve never seen in a disabled toilet Are disabled spaces in Chambers Stret but usually taken. Accessible loos are not on every floor but are clearly listed in the floor plan/map which is available throughout the location. They are all very similar and my biggest issue is that the red cords were cut at every one we went to! The doors are pretty heavy which is off putting but the space inside was wide enough for me to turn in my manual chair with lots of space around for a wider chair or a powerchair to turn with ease.   Four parking spaces are available for disabled visitors at Chambers Street.  Clean, easy to use well marked and very spacious They were good and spacious."
national railway museum york,positive,"We made our way to the museum by train from Harrogate to York. The museum is located at the side of the train station, this was accessible by lift and a short walk around the corner to the museum. There were parking spaces outside the museum for anyone who may wish to travel by car.  Accessible toilets in each shed, all of which were clearly signposted.  There is excellent accessible parking directly outside the front door. The train station is a few minutes walk away. There were several buses passing but unsure of the service. There is also a ""mini train"" shuttle service that takes you to the Minster from the rail museum which is also accessible There seemed to be a large amount  of good sized accessible toilets everywhere throughout the museum. The Museum has a separate car park for Blue Badge Holders which is closer to the Museum than the none-badge holder car park.   We did not have a Blue Badge but there is a 'drop off' point right outside the main entrance where it was safe to disembark our car and not have to rush.  There is also a bus stop right outside the main entrance. There were a couple of accessible loos.  The space was big enough to accommodate a power chair. There is adequate parking at the Museum including Disabled spaces.  I would point our , however, that the Museum is extremely popular and gets very busy in School Holidays and at Special Events. A bus service passes the door but I am not certain if it is Wheelchair friendly. All Disable toilets are easily accessible by wheelchairs and have  turn round spaces.  They accept RADAR keys but I found them open all day!! The railway museum is located just behind York train station and takes approximately two minutes to walk. There is also a large area right outside of the museum where cars can enter to pick up and drop off people who are visiting the museum. There are disabled parking spaces at the entrance nearest the train station which is free of charge. The toilets were large inside with one disabled cubicle. There was plenty of room for both a wheelchair and a carer if needed. Right outside couldn't be easier well signed"
national stadium warszawa,positive,"Special designated underground parking places , multiple lifts available , all types of transport adjusted to a wheelchair users Very spacious in a close range from seats with all latests needed adjustments"
national theatre london,positive,"Parking is available on site by arrangement. The Theatre complex is close to Waterloo Station which offers a range of connections and there are plenty of local buses and taxis. There was a good accessible loo near to the cafe area at ground level. We were staying nearby so it was just a short stroll / wheel from the hotel. The National Theatre is right on London's Southbank so easy to get to. Waterloo is nearby too and which has wheelchair access to the Jubilee line - also National Rail. If you're a blue badge holder attending a performance I believe you can also park underneath the theatre itself. There used to be a few disabled parking spaces at the front of the building (on the riverside) which could be accessed down past the old Cottesloe Theatre - the security guards would always lift the barrier for those displaying a blue badge. However, because of the work, I am not sure if they are still available at the moment. The RNT's onsite underground car park (our Land Rover is 1.94m in height and will NOT get in) has more disabled parking spaces and has a gentle ramp up to automatic doors which lead through to the pay machines and lifts up into the main building. Good spacious facilities at various locations throughout the building. Underground parking within close distance to multiple lifts , all transport links within reasonably close distance. Overall pretty good lacking a little bit of space for better manouvering. Great! You can park right underneath the National Theatre and there are lifts to take you directly to the different floors. The only thing that was a bit disappointing was that you're supposed to be able to take your Blue Badge and your ticket to a desk to get them stamped to get out of the car park for free. But when we were leaving there was no one manning any of the desks. We asked a member of bar staff but they unfortunately couldn't help. Public transport wise - it's really near to Waterloo so convenient place to get to too. Clean, tidy and spacious."
national trust dinefwr carmarthen,positive,"The venue is a huge 800 acre park, so distances are to be expected. By road, there is a 0.8 mile access road, predominantly single track with passing places to access a car park  (admission to venue is paid to the car park attendant). Parking was compacted gravel with no marked bays, and no areas specifically marked out for disabled use.   There is a secondary parking area exclusive for disabled people near the castle, this has room for two cars, but requires the user to open up two gates manually.   The nearest bus stop is 1 mile from the main entrance, and has four buses a day (Monday to Saturday) There was a disabled toilet next to the main car park, although this was an outdoor toilet. There was also an indoor toilet available in the main building. "
national trust for scotlands newhailes musselburgh,negative,As far as I know you need a car
national trust glendurgan garden falmouth,positive,"Drove to the door. Bypassed long queue of other car drivers by waving blue badge. One disabled parking space had been saved for the person who had booked the tramper for that afternoon- me.  Had I not booked, there would have been no parking.  Steepish slope from car to visitor hut. Staff very friendly and welcoming."
national trust godolphin helston,positive,"I was driven, and the parking space was close to the welcome hut, across some bark chippings.  There were limited disabled spaces and the site could get busy, so it was worth arriving when the site opened (Monday morning 10am).  The loo was inside the combined shop/ cafe. There wasn't much space outside to move about but was better once you were in."
national trust pentire wadebridge,positive,"Parking was very close to the site. Think I had to walk about 20m from the car to the site. I don't know about the public transport situation I'm afraid.  IMPORTANT: make sure you come to Pentire / Pentireglaze near Wadebridge, not Pentire at Newquay! We very nearly ended up at completely the wrong place. Accessible toilets including Changing Places. "
national trust stourhead stourton,positive,"There is copious disabled parking in the main car park, close to the entrance and cafe (there is no cafe once you’re inside the grounds except for the publicly accessible pub). The pub also has some disabled flat parking but the rest of the pub car park is loose gravel and difficult with a manual wheelchair. (You pass through the pub and car park getting from the main entrance to the gardens.)  Parking is free for blue badge holders (as it is for NT members).  There is a buggy for visitors but we didn’t find it or how it worked (perhaps we should have asked at reception?) and only saw it once on our walk round the lake. Good roomy disabled loos at the entrance and pub. The only negative was a really nasty smell in the one by the entrance (which we reported."
nationwide coatbridge,negative,The branch is located in the middle of the pedestrian area and as a result there is no Blue badge or any type of parking in the area. There are space round from St Patricks but these fill up very quickly. There are other Blue badge space further West down the Main St approx. 300 meters. The nearest bus stop is located at Coatbridge Fountain this a good 5 to 10 min walk for many people. 
natureland skegness,positive,Pay and display one building away on the same side - blue badge gets you double time. Level pavement to the entrance. Good size wheelchair accessible loo in the cafe. A second one near the exit but staff recommended the newer cafe one. See photo. No changing place.
nautical museum of crete chania,negative,"The Maritime Museum of Crete is located in a distinctive red, 2 storey building on the waterfront on the far western end of Chania's Old Venetian Harbour (see separate review). It's housed within part of Firkas Fortress.  The harbour and the surrounding streets are pedestrianised. Although the walkway round the harbour is level the surrounding street slope down to the harbour. There are buses in Chania but they do not go directly to the harbour area. Not sure where the nearest car park is."
navadhanya edinburgh,positive,Front door on street level right at the bus stop  -easy for a taxi to stop there.  At back of restaurant. Plenty of room to manouevre  both getting to and inside the loo. I left the wheel chair outside the cubicle but I think from memory there would have been room to take it in.
navigation inn solihull,positive,"You drive through pleasant landscape to a Large dirt track area, plenty of room to park."
nawab stirling,negative,Out of order sign on door but it had been used for storage. They quickly cleared it so I could use it. Disabled  toilet quite shabby compared to rest of the restaurant. 
nawab stirling,positive,We were dropped off outside as limited parking on the street. Close to city centre for busses. About a 10 min walk from the train station.
nec national exhibition centre birmingham,negative,"There is parking available quite near to station, but expensive, and there are a number of car parks for the NEC with park and ride facilities, this way being cheaper, and of course you will be dropped off at the hall you will be visiting. We chose to arrive by train however, a more comfortable way to arrive, but then, there is quite a long way for your carer to have to push your wheelchair."
nec national exhibition centre birmingham,positive,"When you find one, it’s usually ok, enough room, busy, so sometimes not as you would like toilets to be, it just depends on time you visit. A lot of times, I have had to use ordinary public toilets  and make do."
nec national exhibition centre marston green,negative,"As stated above, disabled transport and access have extremely low priority. You feel like an imposition, at best. Some loos are very good, others deplorable. To get to the good ones you have to travel a fair distance, if you even know where they are."
nec national exhibition centre marston green,positive,"By car. Very clean. The parking is free for Blue Badge users  and covered. other transport I don't know about but the NEC site will tell you where, how and when. They have disabled loos and also high dependency loos with all the trimming. Radar key will get you in but should you not have one the staff, of which there are many, have keys and will let you in. You must follow the signs and ask where the disabled parking is or you could end up paying £12 a day. The signed directions did confuse me but I got there in the end. The traffic marshals are all very helpful and understanding. Are good but a tip for you is to use the toilets outside the halls as the ones inside can get a bit busy. The ones I used seemed big enough for my needs. Parked right near door, in large under cover area with clearly marked  wide bays Great Changing Places Toilet :)"
nelsons column london,positive,Plenty of buses and taxis pass nearby. Tube stations also nearby as well as Charing Cross railway station. An accessible toilet is available on the West side of the Square. It is part of a suite of toilets.
nene park peterborough,positive,"Didn't drive to park, but easy access from Premier Inn in wheelchair to park as it is flat."
neon sheep edinburgh,negative,"Being on the Royal Mile transport isn't great. It is a steep road. It won't look far from Waverley Station on a map if you go up Jeffery Street, but it is up hill! There are lots of busses that go along North Bridge and South Bridge but it is a busy part of the city and still a bit of a walk away.  Parking is not great here, I'm not sure where the nearest option would be. "
neptune centre middlesbrough,positive,The nearest bus stop to the facility is located outside of the main car park and a path is clearly marked towards the facility.  The disabled parking spaces are located to the right of the facility doors and there is also a taxi rank located directly outside.  The accessible toilet was easy to find and was located near the reception. It is rather large which means there is enough room to maneuver and also have a carer present. The toilet was clean and tidy and was cleaned regularly which was monitored on the wall. 
nest vintage living cardiff,negative,"Some on street parking in Rhiwbina, Disabled on-street space opposite shop.  Rhiwbina accessible by train, shop 500 yards from station."
nethy bridge riverside walk nethy bridge,positive,No designated parking but space at the roadside or at the coffee shop (which is also acc and has been reviewed separately). A bus runs through the village and stops near the bridge at the bottom of the walk.  No toilets on route but public toilets in the village. I used the ones on coffee shop which were excellent. All appropriate rails and plenty of space. 
netto badene copenhagen,positive,"I boarded the boat at Nyhavn. It was easy to get to. Copenhagen has great accessible public transport and buses and metro have wheelchair access.  Nearest metro stop is Kongens Nytorv which has lift access, is 3 -4 minutes walk away. There are also a number of bus routes that stop close by."
neues museum berlin,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Buses along Unter den Linden (100 or 200) will get you quite close, but tend to be crowded. The nearest bus stop is Lustgarten, about five minutes level wheel/walk. The nearest S-bahn station (accessible) is Hackescher Markt, which is about 10 minutes wheel/walk away, a route with quite a lot of cobbles & tramlines to cross and a steepish push up to the crown of the bridge over the Spree. The ticket office is (as of 2016) not in the museum but in the courtyard between the museum and the Alte Nationalgalerie. It is located on level 0, within the Ladies loo. And you need to ask the attendant to unlock it. She was very helpful. The loo is spacious, well-equipped with grab rails, alarm buttons and a wheelchair accessible washbasin. The auto flush may take you by surprise."
nevis range gondola fort william,negative,Toilet easy to find at the top near the cafe but is quite small. There was minimal hand rails and no emergency cord.
nevis range gondola fort william,positive,"We drove there , the range is off the beaten track a few miles out of Fort Wiiliam. Plenty of dedicated accessible parking near the entrance, a lot of the parking is on gravel surface , but there are spaces with tarmac/ paving at side. parking is charged at £3 per day Although I did not visit them on this occasion, there is a  dedicated accessible toilet at the starting point of the Gondola, and another one at the top Massive car park with lots of space. You can park very close to the entrance as well. The centre isn't really in walking distance of much else, it's a little bit outside of Fort William, so a car would be ideal. There are disabled toilets located at both the Gondola Top and Base Stations witch are nice and spacious.  We went there in a private car, there are disabled parking spaces just outside of where the gondolas are "
new cross inn london,negative,"There are bus stops nearby & taxis are available, but the nearby over-ground station does not have level access onto the train. The station itself is fully accessible, but a ramp is needed to board the train. However, this doesn’t need to be pre-booked, and staff are usually prompt at providing it."
new diorama theatre london,positive,"The theatre is located in the middle of Regent's Place, where Triton Square is, a small area on the north side of Euston Road, which has modern office blocks and some cafes.   It can appear a little tricky to find the first time but it's on Triton Street, on a pedestrianised street running parallel to Euston Road. It's very close to the big crossroads of Euston Road, Tottenham Court Road and Hampstead Road where University College Hospital is.  The theatre's sign is in orange, which makes it quite distinctive and easier to stop.  The theatre is near to Euston Station. There are several tube stations within a 5 minute walk. The nearest are Warren Street, Great Portland Street and Euston which are not step free, Euston Square which is step free west bound only, and a little further away is King's Cross which is step free and it's easy to get a bus from King's Cross to the theatre. There are several buses that stop very close by. Step free accessible toilet with grab rail and emergency cord, which reached to the ground. Toilets were spacious and clean and did not require a key to access."
new fancy and mallards pike lake lydney,negative,"There is a disabled toilet available, we were not impressed, and you have to go around to the side on a path to be able to enter it, as taking your wheelchair down the steps would be to bumpy. Ha ha.  The toilet is basic, but it has grab rails. Not impressed though."
new fancy and mallards pike lake lydney,positive,"A nice easy pleasant drive takes you to New Fancy, where two parking areas can be found, on compressed soil areas. At Mallards Pike, keep driving round bends to reach two disabled spots by toilet block, and then go and buy parking ticket for two pounds, with cash only, and pay machine. "
new forest activities beaulieu,positive,We mentioned needing access to the rear of the car so were given a spot with plenty of space. In conversation the staff also mentioned that we could have driven down to the water if necessary (there was a short compact gravel path from the activity centre to the water) A basic loo with level access and room for a wheelchair was available
new forest national park lymington,positive,Disabled parking with no charge at Lyndhurst town centre car park  Wheelchair accessible toilet in Lyndhurst's car park. Didn't come across any toilets on the walk but wouldn't expect any in the middle of the forest.
new forest wildlife park southampton,positive,Blue badge parking near the entrance 
new hall hotel spa sutton coldfield,negative,"After a long driveway, we arrived at a reasonable chipping car park area, no actual disabled bays, but lots of other bays. Difficult to push wheelchair over as deep chippings have to be crossed before reaching paved areas. Entrance to hotel over bridge has a heavy push door to open, but main entrance is reached further along over a paved area, much easier, then door needs to be opened both sides to get in as narrow.  The disabled toilet is along a passage by reception desk, but it is small in there, and you will need to be able to stand to use it. A difficult parking area, having to have wheelchair dragged across an area of deep chippings before reaching paved pathway. After this however, it’s quite easy to get around. Most of the hotel facilities you will need are on the level."
new hopetoun gardens broxburn,negative,"Car park is separate from garden centre (not something that can be changed) but surface of car park around disabled spaces is poor and makes it difficult to move wheelchair around. They have 1,  but it's in the  gift shop and not easy to get to."
new horizons the stockport canal boat trust marple,positive,"Drove there so unable to assess public transport frequency to the area so access based on car Toilet was male/female/disabled.  Double door allowed wheelchair access.  One support handrail, right side"
new lanark mill hotel lanark,positive,"There are designated places in marked bays near the main door. The whole place is accessible, if a little uneven outside. There was a speed hump with a notice by it asking people not to park by it as it had a gap so wheelchair users could get by, but guess what? White van parked right in the gap! Managed to get over the hump anyway and the van had gone by the time we came back. It doesn’t affect entry to the hotel, we encountered it while exploring the site.. Can't comment on the loos in the public area. We had booked an accessible room, so the bathroom was wetroom style with shower seat and grabrails."
new lanark visitor centre lanark,negative,Parked just outside - but route back to the car not very accessible.  
new lanark visitor centre lanark,positive,"Good, spacious toilets throughout the site. "
new look bristol,negative,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately 200m away on Station Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
new look edinburgh,negative,"The Fort is a very large shopping area and the car park is almost always busy.  Therefore although there are disabled parking bays, it can be problematic getting parked."
new look milton keynes,positive,"The Milton Keynes centre has great wheelchair accessibility, with the car park having numerous disabled parking places and the entrance of the shopping centre providing easy accessible ramps. In one of the multi-storey car parks there are ramps and lifts to manoeuvre from different levels of the multi-storey.  The centre has many accessible disabled toilets located all over. The new look store is located directly opposite one set of disabled toilets."
new look paisley,positive,Parking on level one of car park
new look york,negative,There was no parking for this building. Meaning you have to walk/go in a wheelchair quite a distance from the nearest parking place. There were no toilets in this shop.
new pitsligo new pitsligo,positive,"There isn't a place for disabled parking on the main street for access to the church and there should be a zebra crossing or traffic lights near the church to cross the road as it is a busy road at times of the year. And I think it is very important as the park is on the opposite side of the road and kids just run across in front of cars, we need safety for the kids of new Pitsligo. They don't have electric buttons to open the door to the church or the toilet in the church. But they do have a handle bar and that for support but no emergency cord for if someone falls. And they don't have a first aid box either."
new pudsey railway station pudsey,positive,In the train station car park there are several disabled parking spots available; these are located at the front of the car park close to the ticket office and entrance to the platforms again making access to the station easier and more convenient.If you were not driving to the station there is a drop off rank at the front where taxis can pull up near to the ticket office.
new theatre cardiff,negative,The venue has no parking but there is multi-storey parking about 500m away.
new theatre cardiff,positive,Ground floor excellent. On this occasion I sat in the upper circle so I don't know what the disabled toilets are like on that level as I didn't use them.
new theatre oxford,positive,"You will have to park on the road but there are disabled bays on nearby New Inn Hall Street or you can park in residents only bays if you have a blue badge. Buses all stop in the centre of town, not far. There is one at the entrance floor, before you go down to the seats, which is big enough for a carer and has handrails. There is another downstairs, on the Stalls floor which is fine once you're in but problematic to get to alone in a chair because of the tight connecting doors which only prop open if someone has already wedged them open. You need them both open to get a chair through."
new victoria theatre newcastle under lyme,negative,There are disabled toilets but they are ou of the way and small. Difficult to get a powerchair into
new victoria theatre newcastle under lyme,positive,There are disabled parking spaces which can be reserved on a first come first served basis.
new waverley arches edinburgh,positive,"The shops are right beside Waverley Train station, plus a major taxi rank on Market Street. There is on-street parking immediately in front of all of the arches, and the train station car park is available too. Bus stops are a little bit further, but no more than a five or ten minute walk."
new wolsey theatre ipswich,negative,"The parking is not directly connected to the theatre in that it is council parking and blue badge holders still have to pay. I always find this annoying. However, it is flat, reasonably well lit and easy to get to the theatre door from the car park. There are also enough spaces."
new wolsey theatre ipswich,positive,"There are at least 2 accessible toilets - maybe more, but I've only used two. they have always been clean and tidy and have enough room for a wheelchair and a carer."
newark castle anstruther,negative,"Walked here doing the Fife Coastal Path, but there is a long lane that leads to the castle that you can park at."
newberry national volcanic monument bend,positive,All paved and easy slopes Easy to enter and use
newbiggin maritime centre newbiggin by the sea,positive,Free car park for both the Museum and the accessible promenade. Large accessible toilet near to the entrance.
newbridge nurseries horsham,positive,You need to travel by car. There are 4 disabled spaces close to the entrance. The spaces are on the end of 4 rows with hashed lines on just one side of each space so you need to make sure you partk the right way round to open the car door depending on whether the disabled person is the driver or passenger.
newbury green medical practice salford,positive,"I found plenty of disabled spaces, along with a .large main carpark. If I were to come on public transport it would be difficult to reach the centre from where I live Access to toilets directly from waiting area is good, access to disabled toilets good providing not being used by general public,. Parking off street, CCTV, limited to 2hrs.  Bus stop on both side of the street - traffic light controlled, drop kerbs. Ramp/steps from the street. Spacious enough for turning space for wheelchair and carer.  Disabled toilet identified.  No hoist changing space in any toilet - they are not large enough.  In reception area"
newby hall gardens skelton on ure,negative,"Disabled parking was badly signposted and required navigating round trees which was ok as we were in a small car but I think wheelchair accessible vehicles would have struggled The disabled toilet was dirty, tiny (too small to turn my small manual wheelchair around let alone an electric chair) and the red pull cord didn’t reach the floor as it’s required to.  It would have been impossible to use the toilet had I needed someone in there with me to transfer me from my chair to the toilet due to the lack of space.  The toilet itself was probably 1-2 inches higher than a normal toilet which meant my feet didn’t touch the ground causing more risk of falling.  The toilet was also used by children getting changed in and out of swimming costumes."
newcastle city library newcastle upon tyne,positive,"Newcastle Library is very close to the the city centre, there is great public transport links nearby or if you're already in the city, it's within easy walking distance."
newcastle emlyn castle newcastle emlyn,positive,There is a pay & display right next to it.  There is a disabled loo in the Clocktower leading up to the Castle.
newcastle gateshead marriott hotel metrocentre gateshead,positive,"Accessible toilet was ok, door quite heavy but suitable and clean, room to move and grab rails to support.   The pull cord did not reach the floor. "
newens   the original maids of honour richmond,positive,"The nearest tube station is Kew Gardens. It has limited accessibility for people with mobility disabilities. While there are ramps so wheelchair users can access both platforms, there is no lift interchange between the two sides of the station. This means that people travelling from Richmond on exiting find themselves on the same side of the railway line as Kew Gardens and The Original Maids of Honour. However people travelling to Richmond from Central London, are on the opposite side of the railway line and as there is no step free interchange they have to have take an extended route around the railway line to get to there. There is a bus that stops very close to the tea rooms.   From Kew tube station follow the signs to Kew Gardens. When you are opposite the gardens turn right and the cafe is a couple of minutes away, on your right hand side. There is an accessible toilet. It's down a narrow corridor. Through the first door is a small room with a sink, this door locks and then a second door to the toilet. There is a grab rail.  The accessible toilet is quite small and while it was suitable for me with my crutch, I don't think it is wide enough to accomodate a wheelchair."
newhaven quay   brewers fayre edinburgh,negative,Small car park - more of a dropping off point.  It may be inadvisable to arrive here on foot  and public transport isn't great either.
newington cemetery edinburgh,negative,"The number 2, 14, 30 and 33 Lothian buses all stop nearby at Prestonfield Avenue. Some cars do park in the cemetery entrance but it is not clear if this is just for residents or if people visiting the cemetery can park there. On street parking on Dalkeith Road is possible as long as it is not between 7:30 - 9:30am and 4:00 - 6:00pm."
newland health centre lincoln,negative,"two spaces, one hatched. but quite tight if you have a WAV can't turn round need to reverse back out!"

Level access straight into the centre from the street. A spacious well equipped accessible toilet just off the main reception area.
newmarket garage bannockburn,negative,"too many cars on forecourt, not a single disabled space, sloping surfaces make wheelchair use extremely difficult"
newmillerdam country park wakefield,negative,Toilets (chargeable) are located at the end of the lakeside walk near to one of the pubs. Most walkers use the facilities in one of the local pubs or cafes!
newmillerdam country park wakefield,positive,The car park is large and the disabled spaces are located closest to the lakeside path. There is a charge for parking set to a max of £1.70 for 4+ hours. 
newport centre newport,positive,Public car park with disbaled parking spaces opposite the venue. Kingsway multi-storey car park adjacent to the venue. Plenty of disabled parking spaces on the ground floor. Almost five hours parking cost just £2. I used the ordinary toilets but the accessible toilet was next to it.
newquay zoo newquay,positive,"There is a car park just outside the zoo with level access parking spaces for Blue Badge holders. More Blue Badge parking would be useful though as the current spaces are quickly used on busier days. The zoo has a brilliant full sized Changing Places toilet with a ceiling hoist and adult sized changing table. The facility was clean and is checked frequently. There are plenty of hooks for hanging bags and coats, with some at an ideal height for wheelchair users and others higher up."
newseum washington,positive,"Clean, tidy, spacious and set up as we found all the U.S. Restrooms. Located within the standard restrooms."
newton lodge castlewellan,positive,Lots of private parking space in the grounds of the house. Tarmac ground with ramp access to house. Purpose built and fully accessible
next coatbridge,negative,There is a large Car park that is part of this retail park there are Blue badge spaces near the store however these to fill up very quickly.  The nearest bus stops are located out side the retail park on South Circular Road. There are toilets located in the Costa Coffee shop in the store these are located to the back of this area access is via two doors. There are two toilets for general use one is accessible  and was pleased to see that the red cord was all the way down to the floor.

neyras restaurant barcelona,positive,"Toilet quite large, only problem is a sliding door to get into the bathroom ( which slides shut by itself ) you may need someone to hold it open, but the disabled toilet is great."
nice cote dazur airport nice,positive,"The easiest way to get from/ to the airport is to use the tram. The tram is step free and has wheelchair spaces. There are two lines that go to the airport. Most tourist will use tram line 2 that goes from the airport to Port Lympia, as that line goes through Nice city centre. The other tram line 3 goes to Saint Isidore. Tickets need to be purchased, from a machine, before boarding the tram and validated in a machine once you get on it. The trams are very regular. There are accessible toilets with a grab rail."
nics nyc deli glasgow,negative,We got the bus to Glasgow then one to hillhead. Good if you have a concession bus pass. The hillhead sub way is pretty much next to it also. 
nido st james student accommodation glasgow,positive,"The Venue offers a drive - in parking area at the back of the building. Once exited the vehicle one can enter the building through automatic doors. This is accessible to everyone including wheelchairs, as it requires no assistance to have the door opened. If arriving at the location using public transport, one would enter the building from either of it's 5 entrances / exits which are also automatic, thus assuring the visitor no difficulty to enter In addition the accommodation's  close proximity to the Buchanan Bus station, allows the public to access the accommodation within minutes! The building overall offers many accessible toilets. The common area offers 3 toilet sites which are very easy to locate, and one of those specifically designed to accommodate wheelchairs offering a vast space to manoeuvre and for a carer and emergency cords hanging at several corners of the room.  These in term are always kept clean by the cleaners who make sure they are always accommodated with the user's needs. "
nisa local and post office coatbridge,negative,The nearest parking is at the rear of the Quadrant Centre  from there you need to go in the rear doors of the centre and take the lift that is located in the corner at the top of the escalators down to the ground floor as you exit the lift turn right at the café area turn right and you will see the main doors.

no1 royal crescent bath,negative,"Disabled parking is available in Charlotte street public car park, but this is a 5-10 minute wheel/walk to the house & is uphill ! Timing given is approximate and depends on your speed/stamina."
noahs ark zoo farm bristol,positive,"5 star is for the changing places toilet on site, the other toilets aren't huge and are quite basic. "
non viet glasgow,negative,"Parking in this area of the city can be quite difficult. There are two bus stops nearby, it's is a great bus service to most parts of the city from here. "
norie miller park perth,negative,"There were portacabins at the entrance and exit of the event which had an accessible one available. It’s the type that I’ve seen at many events and festivals before and is not very big inside. It could possibly be big enough for a wheelchair user to self-transfer however, there would definitely not be enough room if someone needed assistance.  I don’t think there are any Changing Place toilets near Norie Miller Park however it would be great to have a Mobiloo available at these events for visitors who are unable to use a standard accessible toilet. "
normanby hall country park scunthorpe,positive,"We all drove there by motorhome. The entrance area is wide and there is a car park with some blue badge spaces. We went straight onto the camping field though, which was a bit bumpy but you sort of expect that on a field. I used the normal accessible toilet. It was okay and clean but the gateway in was too narrow for my trike, so I left it outside and walked in. A normal manual chair should be fine though. I didn't see the changing places but I believe there is one. Campsite toilets are in the golf club. These were closed (to campers) due to covid but looked okay. The path to the golf club was smooth and easy... once you get off the field. We mostly used our own facilities though. Great! Plus there is a new bike with wheelchair section on the front you can hire. Changing place!!"
norsey wood billericay,negative,The drive into Norsey Woods is very rutted and has car scraping speed bumps. The state of the road render these unnecessary!  There is a smallish area for disabled parking which is flatter and in better condition than the main car park. It is also right next to the toilets and small visitor centre.
norsey wood billericay,positive,"The toilet was reasonable for an outdoor venue. There was an emergency cord but I don't know how long it would be before anyone responded as this site covers a large area and the visitor centre is not manned, although there is a chidren's nursery next door.  You need a Radar key to access it."
north bay railway scarborough,positive,There are frequent buses from the town centre.
north car park salford,negative,there is enough space allocated for disabled people but when the car park states its full you cant get in to see if the disabled parking is availible

north hayne farm cottages south molton,positive,"I was able to park right outside the house, therefore made it extremely easy to get in and out.  Accessible wet room, easy access to toilet and shower with grab rails and low sink.  The car can be parked right outside the door of the house.  Lots of room and wide doorways."
north kensington library london,positive,"Ladbroke Grove tube station is 2 minutes walk away, but it is not step free. When I exited the train I had to step up onto the platform. Then there was a flight of stairs, with handrail, to the ticket hall. I decided due to the gap between the train and platform that I would travel by bus to go home.  There are several buses that stop nearly outside the library."
north perk bootle,positive,"Very good for a standard accessible toilet, just hard to get to with other customers sitting in the only path to the toilet. It had grab rails and a good sink, and was very clean. "
north pier blackpool,negative,"Not much by way of parking by the pier itself. We parked in a nearby car park and wheeled over but that was a good distance. The trams do pass by the front door which is handy and they are accessible. Most people seem to walk along the promenade which is level and has a nice smooth surface for wheeling along. Only a token part star on this one as the accessible loo sign was covered by an out of use sign that bore the marks of having been there some time. In short, if caught short, you'll have to find an alternative ..."
north yorkshire moors railway pickering,negative,"One guards van had an accessible toilet, Whitby and Pickering stations have good disabled toilets. We travelled from Whitby to Pickering and back so I can only comment about Whitby. There is a station car park but it is expensive and Blue Badge holders still have to pay. We parked in the nearby Co-op car park - maximum stay 4 hours, not free for Blue Badge holders but designated spaces plus one hour free with the Blue badge which just about gives you enough time for the whole return journey. I didn't see an accessible loo onboard. Just the normal train toilets."
north yorkshire moors railway pickering,positive,"While trains run between Whitby and Pickering, both having large public carparks, Grosmont has a reasonable sized carpark which fills long before a train departs. Goathland Station has a very small carpark will no other carpark within half a mile. All carparks require payment including Blue Badge holders. Buses to both Grosmont and Goathland but very few and far  between. As for Levisham station it is so isolated that I doubt any visitor would find it by car so little carparking is available I spent z day on znc off zt each station to check the sration toilets. All are spacious enough for je to rotate in my powered wheelchair and all are well equipped zhd clean. Whitby station has no toilets at all but z council maintained toilet block is literally over the road. A radar key us required af Whitby. The disabled toilet is spacious but it does need updating.  Whitby is were we parked and be aware in the disabled bay parking bays you are limited to two or three hours. In the pay and display on the road you can park all day with a blue badge. Some of the car parks are pay even with the blue badge. We parked at the top of the town and walked down. It is less easy to walk up at the end of the day. Huge carpark at Pickering less than 200 metres from the station with drop off possible.  Whitby station car parking is limited but plenty available on the harbouring. Drop off possible but the ramp to the platforms may take some finding. From the carparks."
northern fish restaurant forres,positive,Free parking  nearby with disabled bays.
northern norway art museum tromso,positive,"Very spacious toilets, with fully deployed alarm cords. Had the standard Scandinavian armrests that you have to pull down."
northern soul grilled cheese manchester,positive,"We walked, but the cafe is near lots of public transport in this part of Northern Quarter."
northlink ferry terminal aberdeen,positive,"We parked at the ferry terminal which was fine, there was no specified disabled bays there, we just waited in a line until it was time to board the ship. We checked in and received our boarding passes and proceeded onto the ship, we parked right by the lift  and headed up, we were met by the ships purser and we were showed to our cabin, the cabin was good and clean, as we were in two wheelchairs it was a little bit of a squeeze. But we were able to adjust by using one wheelchair for using the toilet and shower room. There would be plenty of room for one wheelchair and carer or partner. In the cabin there was enough room for wheelchair user and carer. There are disabled toilets inside the ferry terminal which is smallish but you should manage unless you're a bad driver like me, in which case you may be better just holding it in :). There are also several disabled toilets on the ferry which are bigger."
northlink ferry terminal lerwick,positive,There is a few disabled car parking spaces near the ferry terminal. There is a few disabled toilets on floor 2 which are spacious and very neat and tidy.
northumberlandia cramlington,positive,Car needed. Ample space in car park. Disabled bays by entrance.  Up the ramp at the visitors centre and round the back. Wasn't the smartest but pretty good.
northwest museum of road transport saint helens,negative,Car park over the road in Hall Street-Pay and Display
northwest museum of road transport saint helens,positive,Good sized accessible toilet.
northwich memorial court northwich,positive,Parking is behind the centre. There are always plenty of spaces and there is a zebra crossing to ensure that you can cross. If you get the bus into town the bus stops are only a short distance from the centre with plenty of  marked crossings to make your journey easy and safe.
norton canes services cannock,positive,"Disabled space seems to be abused by people with large car that can't be bother to walk. Better management of this needs to done. Toilets  were not clean. Lots of blue badge spaces. A TIP, if you are just going to the loo park in spaces furthest from main door and enter via Days Inn. Otherwise it is a long trek.  Two fully equipped accessible loos and a great changing places toilet with lots of room and all facilities. "
norton park conference centre edinburgh,negative,"OK if arriving by car or HCL not so great for buses. Nearest stop is Easter Road. There is plenty for disabled parking however you might need to ask somebody how to get into the car park because it is not that obvious. If you are coming by bus (Getting off on London Rd or Easter Rd) can be a bit of a challenge as the kerbs are too high for an electric wheelchair, you would be fine if it was a manual chair."
norton park conference centre edinburgh,positive,Good accessible loo adjacent to other toilets.
norwegian epic barcelona,negative,"Of the 5 destinations, Barcelona was the only one that had wheelchair accessible taxis. Other than that, disabled passengers must be able to climb onto a coach. Electric wheelchairs can not be taken on tour excursions, unless by pure luck the coach has a wheelchair lift. Cannes is a tender port, which means the disabled passenger must be able to walk steps with assistance. To have wheelchair friendly transport on tour excursions, the tour operators must be informed well in advance, and passengers may be asked to pay an extortionate fee for a 'medivan' - I was quoted $900 for a return trip."
norwegian epic barcelona,positive,"All staterooms are ensuite, and travel agencies will send you photographs of the bathrooms on request. All the accessible toilets we used on board were clean, with good grab rails and plenty of space for a carer. They also had automatic doors with a push button on the outside, and then could locked from the inside. The only thing that we found slightly odd was that the sink is not in the bathroom, meaning the passenger has to leave the bathroom to wash their hands. In our stateroom the bathroom door opened outwards, and was fairly close to the bed."
norwich playhouse norwich,negative,"3 marked parking spaces are available at the front of the building....but its a large area, and to be honest, last time I went, we parked on double yellows as its legal to do that anyway!"
norwich playhouse norwich,positive,There's a disabled toilet on the ground floor and the balcony level. I didn't visit the main toilets.
norwich railway station norwich,negative,Lots of room and appropriate rails. Radar key required.   The emergency pull cord is too far from the ground and will not be accessible if somebody falls.
norwich railway station norwich,positive,Some disabled parking spaces near entrance.
norwich theatre royal norwich,negative,"The theatre doesn't have parking itself but a short distance away there is a very convenient shopping centre car park with loads of spaces for disabled vehicles. Parking is limited nearby, which can be problematic. "
norwich theatre royal norwich,positive,"Although we didn't need to park, everything was explained in the information All items to help were in place. Transport in two car parks within 100 yards and disabled parking on roads opposite Easy to find. Drop off places right outside venue Car parking close by with plenty of disabled places Plenty of disabled toilets, clean with plenty of room for guide dog or a carer The  disabled access toilet is conveniently situated by the stalls.  Just over the road You can actually get in and move around but often has a queue of non disabled as always queues at the ladoes in a theatre!"
notarianni ice cream ltd blackpool,negative,There is some limited parking available in the street around this venue the nearest tram stop is Waterloo Road. It is only a few minutes walk to this venue.
notcutts surrey garden centre cranleigh,positive,"Bus passes nearby on main road and I think stops nearby - garden centre is a short distance from road (guessing a good fee hundred metres). Large car park has Blue Badge spaces which have recently (writing this addendum in March 2016) been enlarged and repainted. Car park surface around disabled bays has similarly been resurfaced. Lovely, spacious, clean, large. All necessary rails and alarm.   Located near cafe, with other loos."
notcutts victoria garden centre pontefract,positive,"Parking is usually good but can get very busy so disabled bays can be full, however the rest of the parking is still quite good Nice and clean large disabled toilet"
nothe fort weymouth,positive,Several parking areas close to the Fort with plenty of disabled spaces.
notre dame du port nice,positive,Port Lympia is the final stop on the Line 2 tram. From the station there are stairs with handrail or a lift to road level where the church is. Several buses stop close by too.
nottingham road fire station derby,positive,Depending on what bus route you use there are 3 bus stops located near the fire station. One disabled pay at end of ramp. 
nova cinema woking,negative,Only 1 accessible loo that is also used by the theatre in the same complex. The loo really does need upgrading as quite shabby and not a lot of room especially if a carer is needed.
nova cinema woking,positive,Plenty of disabled spaces in the Peacock shopping centre but it can get very busy.
nova prestatyn,positive,"Large car park, fairly flat and plenty of accessible bays One we saw in changing room was ok, see above"
novello theatre london,negative,Train to London Victoria and then a Cab to Novello
novello theatre london,positive,"We went by train so can't comment on parking.  It was a twenty minute relatively easy push (my daughter pushed me) from Waterloo - level with a gentle incline at one end of Waterloo bridge and then up to the wheelchair accessible entrance to the station.  Nearest tube does not have step free access (Covent Garden).  However Taxis abound round theatre land, and are wheelchair accessible. Near to dress circle on same level.  Clean and well equipped."
novotel birmingham airport hotel birmingham,positive,Booked this as flying from Birmingham airport the next day.  Is right opposite the entrance to the airport and not too far from bus stops.
novotel edinburgh centre edinburgh,negative,"The hotel has a carpark and 1 accessible Parking space which can be booked if the hotel is given prior notice. If this space is taken, there is also space in the courtyard behind the hotel that can be used."
novotel edinburgh centre edinburgh,positive,The hotel has an on site car park in the basement. Places can be reserved by prior arrangement with the hotel.  There are bus stops within a few metres of the hotel entrance. The hotel does have the benefit of an underground car park. Disabled guests can arrange to use this by contacting the hotel in advance of their stay.  Lauriston Place is served by several Lothian bus services; all of which have wheelchair access.
novotel edinburgh park hotel edinburgh,negative,"The accessible bedroom had a bath, in spite of my stating my need for a roll-in shower. Such rooms do exist but I can't advise how to ensure you get one."
novotel edinburgh park hotel edinburgh,positive,Good parking close to the door. Just a few minutes from the tram and train stations at Edinburgh Park.
nuffield health edinburgh fitness wellbeing gym edinburgh,positive,"There is blue badge parking right next to the main door. Buses stop a bit away (Lothian 4, 20, 34,  35, 44) but the paths and drop kerbs are flat if you’d like to come this way. I come by foot (on wheels) through the Water of Leith pathway. As I mentioned above the toilet is also a changing room / shower room with seating and rails. There is also a red cord next to the shower although this doesn’t reach to the floor yet. Inside this room there are also two low down accessible lockers which are very spacious. I have taken pictures and written captions which you can view. I dropped a half star as there was not a red cord next to the toilet which I think is a big safety issue."
nuffield health fitness wellbeing glasgow,positive,"There are multiple disabled parking spaces within a few steps of the building.  There are multiple disabled toilets in the facility, which are clearly marked to inform others easily. "
number 7 haddington,negative,"No parking outside restaurant, but plenty of blue badge spaces within 300m walk. Clean and tidy. Good space to get in with carer, but not wide enough to turn round."
nutfield priory hotel spa redhill,negative,"There are two disabled bays opposite the main hotels entrance, ideal up to a point, as there was a step to get up into hotel and no ramp in sight. Staff will put one down for you however."
nutfield priory hotel spa redhill,positive,"The disabled bays are very close to the entrance of hotel. We enjoyed our journey to the hotel, the driveway itself was most welcoming, and we found two bays right up by hotels entrance ideal for disabled."
nuthurst grange country house hotel solihull,negative,"It’s a lovely drive to get to NutHurst Grange hotel, the whole area is of wonderful countryside views, there is a beautiful long tree lined avenue up to the house, and a number of different parking areas, but sadly, only one disabled bay available, and that is very close to the entrance into hotel, but if you miss this spot, then it is a bit of a push for your carer to get you into house, and they will need to go and get help to have a ramp put down to help you up the steps into hotel. (See the photos in parts one and two for parking details). On this part two review we show you the main car park, but it’s not really suitable for disabled parking, although we suggest driver takes you up to reception entrance, helps you inside by asking for a ramp to be placed by door, then takes car back to main car park, then they can enjoy the walk to reception. But they to must be able to manage the steps by themselves.  Or park the car by reception door in the one and only disabled bay, as shown on photos for part one."
nuthurst grange country house hotel solihull,positive,"It’s quite easy to get to the public disabled toilet, nicely furnished in pale colours, with pull cord and grab rail, (see photo of WC in part one) Very clean and well maintained. These are inside of hotel as shown on part one review One disabled bay, right by front door, grateful to have this, but do read part one and two for details of other parking. It’s just a few feet away from restaurants, on the level, and nice and clean, with grab rail to help you."
nymans handcross,positive,Venue is really only accessible by car and it is not close to any nearby town. Excellent blue badge parking - 9 spaces. Would get 5 stars but as the years go by and more people are given blue badges all venues need to increase the number of blue badge car parking spaces. We arrived early which was fortunate as all the spaces were occupied later.  Two disabled toilets which are clearly marked. Would have received 5 stars but the large nappy bin is always a compromise. I would be great to go to a location where disabled visitors do not have to share with baby changing  as this compromises access. 9 clearly marked wide disabled parking bays close to the entrance and cafe  Two disabled toilets. One near to the car park and the second at the cafe. It is shared with baby changing and the large nappy bun could be a problem for some wheelchair users 
o2 academy bristol,negative,There is some double yellow line parking with a blue badge fairly close. Otherwise it is a multi storey car park.  Nearby car park set price after 6pm for all users. There is a steep hill down from the carpark to the venue 
o2 academy glasgow,negative,"Sadly, there was no disabled parking available so we had to park on the street in a precarious postion, it wasn't even really a parking space.   There is no official parking, we parked in a nearby carpark . There is a bus stop right outside The toilet is accessible, but very poor. It has folded up manual chairs to the right of the seat so I could not line my chair up. It would be extremely cramped to get a carer in to assist and I almost fell transferring. It is not especially clean or well lit and there is no space to turn.  We ended up parking on a side street on a double yellow line - the bouncers said it should be fine. It was but we weren't all that happy leaving the car there. We couldn't find any other options.    Once we were out of the car we had to battle with the horrific pavements - lots of potholes, bumps, cracks etc.  Rarely seen anything so bad! There is no parking, disabled or otherwise at the venue but we arrived early enough to park quite close in a side street for free. There were little to no parking options at the venue so we just parked at our hotel, premier inn Glasgow City Centre South hotel witch was roughly half a mile from the venue. Warning, potholes everywhere.  I took a taxi to the venue, there were no issues dropping me off close bye. There are bus stops on both sides of the road servicing the southside and city centre. The subway is a couple of hundred yards away. On street parking is limited.  Although fairly small the toilet was clean and manageable, and I am using an electric wheelchair. Previous comments talked about clutter and Cleanliness but I’m pleased to say they have upped their game. "
o2 academy glasgow,positive,"There was an accessible toilet which required a radar key. A member of staff wheeled me from where I was sitting to the loo, went to get a key and then waited to return me to my seat. It wasn't the cleanest but good otherwise. if you needed to transfer to the loo, you'd have to move a bin. The red cord was good. Plenty of on street parking."
o2 academy islington london,negative,The venue is in a shopping centre and there is a car park there. I came by tube to Angel which is OK for me as a walking stick user as it has escalators. There are a number of buses stopping near the venue.
o2 academy london,negative,"The venue has no parking of its own. There are two public Blue Badge bays outside the venue. But the best option is to try to park in the streets around the venue, which do allow parking for Blue Badge holders - though we didn't find any dedicated bays. The disabled toilet is a good size and you need a Radar key for it, which prevents it from being abused and helps to keep it in a good state of cleanliness.  That though is the only good thing I can say about it.  It's location is not convenient for a wheelchair user, being that it is right at the back of the auditorium about eighty feet or so from the disabled area. Not so bad if you have a catheter but if you don't and you need to go, you are going to have to fight your way through eighty feet of wall to wall bodies. And you know what it's like, most able bodied folk can't see below chest height and are oblivious to wheelchairs......ooh, all those ankles and feet for the taking!"
o2 academy london,positive,"We went by public transport.  The venue is a small walk away.  Leaving was much busier in general in the area which made it a more difficult walk then arriving.  Staff at the train station were helpful.  There is an accessible toilet, with drop-down rails, between the entrance and the disabled viewing platform, close to one of the bars. The door is RADAR key compatible, and there is usually a member of staff on hand to assist, especially at the end of gigs."
o2 forum kentish town london,negative,We used Justpark and got parking not too far. London is not great for accessible transport for me!
o2 forum kentish town london,positive,NKS/radar which was good. Adequate grab rails and enough rom for a large chair. 
o2 shepherds bush empire london,negative,"Parking isn't great, but if you get there early and have a blue badge, you can probably get parked on the street behind the venue. I did, I just gave myself plenty time in case it was busy."
o2 shepherds bush empire london,positive,"I believe there is a disabled loo on the ground floor, however I didn't use it so can't provide any detail."
oak furniture land lincoln,positive,Disabled parking right outside the door
oakdale junior school poole,positive,There are disabled toilets in the reception area.
oakingham belle wokingham,positive,"Not sure of public transport, but 3 disabled parking spaces right by the entrance pass. There’s a wide door to get to the toilet area which isn’t heavy. However, if it’s an issue it can be hooked up to hold it wide open, which a staff member did for me for easier access.  Good standard disabled loo / baby changing. Plenty of grab rails, an emergency cord all the way to the ground, long mirror, and plenty of room for a carer. Nicely tiled, clean and tidy. Heads up there’s no hoist or adult changing station if that is needed for you."
oaklands church broughton,negative,You'd need your own transport. Parking right outside the lodge for two cars on level hard standing  No grab rails though a toilet frame was supplied on request. Absence of wall mounted rails was a real issue. No room beside loo for transfer from wheelchair.  The shower seat provided wasn't adjustable and was very low. The one grab rail in the shower wasn't well positioned (vertical and high).  The wet room was however level access.
oaktree garden centre nursery winkfield,negative,"There are about four disabled parking bays however two can prove a bit difficult to get into, as they can be obstructed by trolleys. There is plenty of other parking. Toilets are accessed by ramp, including the disabled toilet. The door to the toilet area has a raised threshold - OK for those with some mobility, but not so sure about wheel chair users. The facilities seem rather cramped. There is signage from the coffee shop."
oakwell stadium barnsley,negative,"Parking facilities for away supporters are located off Queens Road by the Barnsley metrodome leisure facility. The parking spaces are on quite a steep hill with only a few spaces that provide parking with flat access and it is possible that you may get blocked in, with a long wait to get out at the end of the game. However, if you get to the ground early there are spaces outside the metrodome leisure center, which are a lot more spacious and easier to use for people who are less ambulant, yet these are a bit of a walk from the stadium. The disabled toilets are located in the concourse so it is best to avoid going during half time. The toilet nearest the away disabled seats is a good size but is a bit small if you need to transfer off the wheelchair. It is well maintained, which is better than some of the grounds I have been to."
oakwood eyecare derby,positive,The Arriva 26 bus stops near by but you do have to either cross the car park or go down road to get into the centre.  There is a parking space but it is very small.
oasis park fuerteventura la lajita,positive,"As we were picked up at our hotel by the coach (Low access and the driver stowed my wheelchair, I didn't actually see the disabled parking but I would imagine there was some.  Using the FREE coach transfer was good, seeing parts of the Island we had not been to on our island tour."
oatlands park hotel weybridge,positive,"Following our short drive through built up areas, we arrived at this beautiful historical hotel, with nicely laid our grounds that immediately impressed us, and found a couple of disabled bays right by the hotels entrance. The attractive entrance was all on the level, with a double pull handled door that led us into the hotels reception area."
oban chocolate company oban,negative,"The cafe is on the Prom, no designed parking, bu drop offs would be possible."
oban youth hostel oban,positive,We had no trouble getting a place in the on-site parking.
ocean cantonese restaurant north hykeham,negative,They only gave non disabled toilets but cubicles are a good size
ocean cantonese restaurant north hykeham,positive,"There are 4/5 spaces, car park is all on the flat"
ocean fish bar cleethorpes,negative,Can't say did not use them and could not see where they were within the premises but not too far away from the public toilets situated near the car park across the road.  No clear signage directing customers to the toilets visible on my visit.
ocean fish bar cleethorpes,positive,There isn't parking at the side but there is a car park directly opposite that I fairly priced  Accessible toilets from both ends of the restaurant and a disabled toilet easily located
ocean terminal shopping centre edinburgh,negative,"Whilst there are four accessible toilets in the main centre these have been rendered useless for many wheelchair users by the placement of so many bins. So much so that it has become impossible to undertake a side transfer to use the loo.  Come on Ocean Terminal at least have some loos that can be used as originally designed. Without good toilet facilties the thought of spending any time at the Centre or indeed visiting at all falls off the radar. Tried to use a toilet from a wheelchair. Had great difficulty to find enough room to shut the door, then discovered no way to get wheelchair into transfer position until I had put 2 of the three bins out into the passage. And this was a reference manual chair (1100mm x 705mm)."
ocean terminal shopping centre edinburgh,positive,There are bus stops right outside Ocean Terminal that go all over Edinburgh. There is also Blue Badge parking so that you can easily enter the shopping centre. Excellent parking on all levels of the multi story car park. All bays were close to the shopping centre doors and lifts. Accessible toilets were situated on each main floor. A choice of two on each floor with different layouts in each. A bit tight on the ground floor for some users due to several waste bins being installed. Lots of Disabled parking on level C in both car parks.  Access from each level to the shopping centre where there are lifts available to travel between floors.  There is free parking for all visitors to the Centre whether disabled or not which is a great service for everyone.
ocho inveraray,negative,No wheelchair accessible toilet but the town's disabled loos are directly across from the restaurant and staffed/open during Ocho's service hours. 
ocho inveraray,positive,Disabled parking available within yards of entrance. Situated by beautiful Loch Fyne with spectacular views across to the Arrochar Alps. Main shopping street and other attractions close by - Access to other attractions not always wheelchair accessible. 
oconnells bar diner kirkcaldy,negative,Privately owned pay and display parking nearby but no disabled parking. However on street parking available. Not too far from public transport.
oconnells bar diner kirkcaldy,positive,Well signed disabled toilet. Lots of grab rails. Plenty of room for helper. Clean and tidy.
odeon cinema banbury,positive,The disabled parking is just across the road from the theatre and fortunately there were spaces available.
odeon cinema brierley hill,positive,"There are lots of disabled parking spots, which are monitored for proper use.There are a number of buses that go to Merry Hill There are accessible toilets that are quite spacious"
odeon cinema brighton,negative,"There are grab rails in one of three cubicles, with very narrow entrances to the toilet on both floors making it very difficult to fit a Wheelchair through. There would be no room for a carer to assist in the cubicles."
odeon cinema brighton,positive,"There is a Car park directly behind the cinema, with disabled parking. However getting a bus is difficult even though the cinema is situated in the town center the buses do not go down the hill  to the cinema and are a 5-10 minute walk away."
odeon cinema chatham,positive,There are plenty of disabled parking spaces- some very close to the entrance. It would probably be possible to 'drop off' at the door. Normal accessible disabled loo with usual facilities and plenty of space for carer if required. Not sure about adult changing facilities. Could have been cleaner but not offensive.
odeon cinema edinburgh,positive,Disabled parking right at door and accesible Toilets inside Lots of parking close to the cinema. Shame the door opens inwards. Was a little bit tight with the powerchair but would be fine for someone in a smaller wheelchair.
odeon cinema huddersfield,positive,"Odeon Cinema is located outside the centre of Huddersfield, next to the Galpharm Stadium, which is sign posted from Leeds Road, Huddersfield. Is easy to find and is not situated on a rod that has a steep gradient. A large car park is available with sufficient parking spaces. We drove to the venue.  Unfortunately the Odeon car park becomes an overflow car park when there is a football match on at the John Smiths' stadium ...as there was on the night in question. Parking was not as easy as it usually is & we ended up parking half on half off the pavement! There is an accessible loo that was easy find. It was clean & tidy with plenty of room to manoeuvre & enough space for a carer (should one be required). It also has more than enough grabrails."
odeon cinema kilmarnock,negative,Part of the car park was shut off for maintenance which blocked off some of the disabled parking. Although when enquired about they said it was only temporary. 
odeon cinema wallsend,negative,"Just had a quick peek in the loo, not enough room to take my scooter in, whilst it appears larger than a normal sized loo there wasn't a lot of room for manoeuvering a wheelchair and having an assistant. It was clean and easy to locate, with a grab rail."
odeon edinburgh,negative,"My only quibble is the venue is a bit out of the way, so car or taxi may be in order.  The one-way system round the car park is  rather hard to fathom but it is lovely and big with plenty of disabled spaces. Brilliant that there are several spaces directly outside the cinema. We got the last one on a very quiet evening so I think they perhaps need more - or some kind of policing of the bays. There were only 6 disabled spaces, it was a busy time 8pm on a Friday night and all the spaces were full.  We had difficulty parking in the nearest standard space as it was too small and far away from entrance. Lots more disabled spaces needed"
odeon edinburgh,positive,"Well appointed, large and clean - fairly 'universal' for this type of venue. Plenty of disabled parking spaces right outside. Clean and room to turn with no problems. Great public transport on Lothian Road. There is an accessible toilet, need to take a picture at next visit. There are 2 just before the entrance to the screens. One has baby change in it (lhs) and is larger.  Oddly the one of the Right hand side which is smaller and isn't a baby change  has a nappy bin in it beside the loo which prevents a wheelchair user from being able to transfer. A very nice member of staff said she'd look into this. There is limited parking nearby. We drove and parked in a loading bay with blue badge access on Lothian Road. Bus stops on Lothian Road for many bus routes. Very spacious. Spotlessly clean. Grab rails. Lots of room for manual wheelchair plus carer. Toilets were easily accessible. Would be nice to have a separate room for changing facilities with aids and a hoist. Disabled parking very close to main entrance to cinema I saw or saw signs to an accessible toilet but didn’t use it."
odeon liverpool one liverpool,negative,"Liverpool One Odeon is part of Liverpool One shopping area of Liverpool Town Centre. I don't know what the car park is like, but taxis can drop off nearby and there's a walkway to Chavasse Park which leads to the row of restaurants  the odeon is next to. The train stations, Central and Moorfields,  aren't too far away either. I would say it takes about 15 minutes to get from either one to the Odeon "
odeon luxe dundee,positive,"There are parking spaces near the door for blue badge users, and bus stops nearby The new toilets are great! Much easier to access, bigger, and cleaner. There was plenty of space, it had grab rails and there were more toilets about.  The toilets in the sense area are not working There is also a changing places toilet! This is located next to screen 7. Access with radar key.  UPDATE (31st Jan): The changing places toilet has been locked and has had an ""out of order sign"" on it since the Odeon upgrade was done. Today I asked staff about it and spoke to a very helpful woman- Kim. She offered to show me the toilet and it looks great! (see photos) she explained that the plumbing at that side of the building isn't working and they have had people out seeing about it (I had seen these workers previously coming in). It sounds like it is not an easy fix but they are trying. She said that the changing places toilet can still be used if needed but the toilet and sink cannot be used at this time as the water doesn't drain. If you need to use the plinth but not the toilet then you can still access the toilet with a radar key. The whole front row of parking at the cinema is reserved for blue badge holders. There is plenty of accessible parking, I would say at least 10 spaces. Other parking spaces are nearby and there are clear pathways for people coming by foot.  There are a few bus stops around the area of Dundee were the cinema is and they come from all over Dundee, bus stops I would say are at least a 5-minute walk in either direction of the cinema.   Train station is 15-minute drive away and there are plenty of taxis services around Dundee."
odeon luxe glasgow,negative,Parking at the quay is a complete farce  ....drop off points are curced so difficult to get the correct space to get the wheelchair in and out and to top it off selfish drivers using these drop off points to park meaning we have to actually go into the road to be dropped off ot picked up ....useless
odeon luxe glasgow,positive,"Disabled parking bays are provided - there's quite a few right in front of the cinema and extra ones off to the side, in front of the hotel.   Would be possible to get a bus to Paisley Road West and wheel into the Quay and to the cinema, but it's probably a 5-10 minute walk. There's a shortcut from the main road, but that only has stairs.  The accessible toilet is nice and big, although occasionally needs cleaned a bit more frequently.  Travelling by car seems quite straightforward to this cinema, it shares a large car-park with other restaurants etc at the Quay, but there are many disabled parking spaces in front of the cinema. There is also a 'drop-off' point directly outside.  It is possible to get there by public transport: Shields Road is the nearest underground, and I think it's about a mile to Glasgow Central Station, but I'm not sure how easy the routes from these are to negotiate. (we came by car) All the toilets are located off the main foyer, clearly signed and easy to find. There only appeared to be one accessible toilet, however it was extremely clean.   There was fixed wall support to the left side (if on the toilet) and a moveable support on the right side.  There was a dyson-style handdryer, which is great, but I guess some people could find awkward to use.  There was room for a carer to be able to assist."
odeon luxe london,positive,"The nearest tube stations are Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus or Charing Cross, none of which offer step free access. However, there are a lot of buses that stop close by. There was an accessible toilet next to screen 5. It was spacious and clean. It had grab rails and an emergency cord which reached towards the ground."
off the rails yarmouth,negative,There's little dedicated parking but there was space to park outside both times when we visited.  Level ground if going from parking spaces to the entrance on former station platform.
off the rails yarmouth,positive,"Only deducted half a star because there's a door to open before you reach the disabled loo  - planning regs I suspect or something similar. I dare say the staff would have helped me with it if I'd been alone.  Accessible loo had everything I needed, clean, well equipped etc."
ohares lounge bars newcastle,positive,Massive car park at back entrance.
old bar leeds,negative,"bar is located in a pedestrianised zone, making parking a little tricky."
old bar leeds,positive,"A number of disabled car parking spaces available around the University; disabled visitors can use these spaces by showing their “blue badge” on arrival to a Security Officer at the entrance gate.  There are a number of buses that go to the University and will stop outside the Parkinson building; from there it is a 5 minute walk to the Union, with step free access.  Easy to find accessible toilet; very large with hand rails Two disabled/gender neutral  toilets and a changing place available"
old barn garden centre horsham,negative,"Easy to find the accessible loo, but you have to go through an outer door to get to it."
old barn garden centre horsham,positive,Plenty of disabled parking but it does get very busy especially around lunchtime.
old byre slaley,positive,Parking immediately outside the cottage.
old coach house hotel buckie,positive,The parking is one of the hotels better features to be honest. There is a car park basically touching the hotel so not far to get from there to the hotel.
old course st andrews,negative,The toilet block on the course isn't strictly disabled access but could be used. But the proper disabled toilets are a two minute drive from here at the West Sands.
old course st andrews,positive,You can park near the Jigger Inn which is beside the Old Course Hotel. Access to the path is from the car park. 
old dairy farm craft centre northampton,negative,"Just one bay, and it’s awkward to shuffle into, but other spots to park a few yards along country lane in farmyard area. No disabled toilet seen, just very basic toilets."
old fortress corfu,positive,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced.
old hall sandbach,positive,"There are 2,spaces outside the main entrance in the car park. For fit people as access is by steps... Alternatively go to the left on entering and head towards the wooden building, plenty of spaces But those spaces are small and on a slope with you having to parallel means you either have the door slipping from you hand or hard work opening it"
old hunstanton beach hunstanton,negative,"There’s plenty of parking but there’s a fairly steep hill and the car parking is on loose , uneven stones or grass. There aren’t any specific disabled places and Blue Badge holders have to pay for parking. There are public toilets at the top end of the car park. The disabled toilet needs a radar key but I didn’t use it so can’t confirm what’s inside."
old inns cafe cumbernauld,positive,"There is a disabled parking bay directly in front of the entrance, and another two accessible parking bays only 20 yards from the main door. It's a favourite of mine on the way to or from Stirling. The accessible loo had everything I needed for my visit, and was extremely clean. It would be a little tight for wheelchair users who need a little more room for manoeuvre, but it was fine for me. "
old kiln cafe and shop port ellen,positive,"Dedicated spots, bit of a slope to get down to the distillery buildings. Step free into restaurant. "
old loans inn loans,positive,Parking was behind the hotel itself in direct access to trception.  There are no steps  The toilets in the public area are signed clearly. The toilets were completely accessible with grab rails and wide enough for tuning room.  
old market hereford hereford,positive,"There are two accessible toilets and the CP toilets. I followed the signs that were clearly marked and directed me to the toilets on the first floor where the management suite can be found. I did not take much notice of the two accessible toilets however as the CP toilets were at a very high standard I would expect that they would be as well. In the Changing Places toilet there was: Bench - Height Adjustable, Adult Sized, Wall Mounted Hoist - Ceiling Toilet Washbasin Height Adjustable Emergency Alarms Privacy Screen"
old north inn hotel inverness,positive,"Compact but enough room for carer with 5 grab rails, emergency cord, folded up baby changing table. Very clean."
old synagogue krakow,positive,"The road parallel to the restaurant is a main road which has trams running along. I didn't use the tram while I was there so unable to comment, apart from I noticed that the new trams had wheelchair signs by one of the doors."
old trafford stretford,positive,"We parked on the Manchester United car parking which is a prebookable place through online and your literally 100m away from the stadium it is £12 for the day and is open three hours before kick off. Enough space for a mobility scooter, lots of handy grab rails, very clean and tidy plenty of space for multiple people Disabled parking near the entrance. Lots of disabled toilets all accessible by a radar key, however, there are accessible stewards on hand always should you require access and not have a key."
oldway mansion paignton,positive,Paignton is the nearest railway. However there are buses that stop on the main road near the entrance to the gardens. There is also public car parking including disabled bays.
ollies glasgow,negative,"Just parking on road outside but pretty busy area so space not guaranteed. Would rate higher if just looking for mens! I got off the bus 30/40 yards away. Because there is no drop kerb on either side of the road you have to cross, you have to turn left travel 30 yards, cross the road and then 30 yards back again. This is obviously not the premises's fault but Glasgow City councils. There is plenty of on street parking but because it's a residential area, it can get quite busy.  While I was sitting outside waiting for a friend I asked a member of staff if they had a accessible toilet. I was told they did so I felt quite comfortable having a couple of beers. When it was time to use the WC, I discovered that their interpretation of an accessible toilet and mine where miles apart. You could get in but with it being no bigger than a closet there was no chance of me using it independently. I had my carer with me so I was able to get help. "
olympia london london,negative,"I organised passenger assist for a train from Guildford to Olympia via Clapham. They rescheduled  train without me knowing and didn't stop at Clapham. There were no ramps at Waterloo so I had to hold the open door button and Jam my chair to stop the door closing so the train wouldn't leave while my carer tried to find a guard! Not enough accessible toilets and no one to stop abuse. I feel there should be a radar key lock on the toilet and also more accessible toilets as there were 1000's of people. The queues for the ladies/gents was huge so they were taking the accessible ones. I always drive as public transport is hit and miss. There are no concessions on the extortionate car park rates. The blue badge parking is on the same floor as staff parking and on one day (18/1/20) they had put barriers up across the entrance so disabled people could not use the blue badge area. We parked up a few floors, had to put my wheelchair together with cars driving past and the lifts are very difficult and tight for Powerchair/scooter users.  I did not see any changing places toilets. In one hall all the disabled toilets are inside the gendered toilets, inaccessible for wheelchairs and scooters, people won’t move out of the way if there is a queue, and I found mops and cleaning equipment stored in one. In the other hall where there is separate accessible toilets there are no radar keys so used by all. There are more upstairs, but there's only one lift so you often have to queue for ages to use the lift that malfunctions. Very poor for a venue of this size. "
on the waterfront exeter,positive,There's a couple of disabled spaces provided at The Quay. Nothing to do with this restaurant. Oh and be prepared for cobbles. All the roads around the Quay are cobbled with deep ridges.
on x linwood linwood,positive,Superb disabled parking with 40 hours per week of supervision of spaces due to misuse during busy periods. If only every centre had this!! Top of the range and extremely spacious (again see pics).
one square edinburgh,negative,The hotel has its own car park at rear with a handful of disabled bays. But it is expensive.
one square edinburgh,positive,"Great. Very large and accessible. Grab rails by loo. Full length mirror. It would be better if accessible loo was available on the same floor as the bar. The restaurant is within Sheraton Hotel, which has two entrances. One entrance on Lothian Road and a second entrance off the Western Approach Road. There are good bus links along Lothian road from across Edinburgh, there is also a taxi rank on Festival Square, parking is also available at the Western Approach Road entrance and taxis can also drop off here too. The accessible toilet is just outside of the restaurant in the hotel (with the other toilets), it's spacious, clean and has grab rails. Inside the Sheraton Hotel, One Square is close to Lothian Road where there are numerous busses, wide paths and a large taxi rank.  Beautiful, clean and completely luxurious. I think the signage to the toilets could be improved however. It's difficult to see in the picture (again because of the very dark interiors), but there is a red cord hanging there."
one2two coffee shop cardiff,negative,No car park. On road parking a nightmare. Close to a bus stop. In a corridor with open doorway opposite. Fine to get into and out of but the link area is often busy and there are lots of prams  parked.
oodles chinese leeds,positive,"There is a car park for the nearby Morrison's, & another for the Merrion centre itself very close by, which have disabled parking bays. There is also a bus stop very close by, a taxi rank, & the train station is about a mile away."
opal moon glasgow,negative,Parking is on street and all depends on you being lucky! Also there is a distinct lack of dropped kerbs but the pavement is negotiable.  Approach to this shop is not brilliant but it is possible to travel by powerchair from Great Western Road or the nearby Botanic Gardens.
open air theatre scarborough,positive,"There is a drop off point on the main road for cars carrying a disabled passenger. Northstead Lower car park is recommended for parking (approx. 200 metres from venue), but spaces here are limited. Alternative recommended parking is on Royal Albert Drive, though it is emphasised that this is a good 10 minute walk away."
opera de nice nice,positive,"The Opera House is in Vieux Nice, the old town, and it's entrance is one block away from the sea front, where several buses stop close by.  There was an accessible toilet on the ground floorand as the lift stopped going up I think I noticed signs to some others. The Opera House is in Vieux Nice, the old town, and it's entrance is one block away from the sea front, where several buses stop close by.  There was an accessible toilet on the ground floor."
oran mor glasgow,negative,"There are two accessible loos, one on the second floor that I didn't visit and one in the basement as you come out of the lift before going through a security door into the music venue. The loo door was okay to open, not too heavy and there was plenty of space to maneuver the chair around. There were grab handles with a drop down one next to the loo. It was reasonably clean, the soap and paper dispensers were full. "
oran mor glasgow,positive,I had no difficulty parking near to venue. There is a disabled bay across the road outside the entrance to the Botanic Gardens on Queen Margaret Drive and two bays outside the library on Byres Road a short distance away. However you have to bear in mind this was a Sunday evening in a very busy park of the city. 
orange tree hitchin,positive,Large car-park with numerous disabled parking bays. Quite large toilet with enough room for a carer/aide. Has grab rails. Easily accessible but no/little signage so would have to ask staff where it is.
orchard trust stowfield day centre lydbrook,positive,"Three carparks available. Use as much room as needed. Plenty of room for vehicle ramps out of the side or rear of vehicle. Use own transport. Changing room place. This means there is hoists and a bed available. The room is very big with plenty of space for chair, carers and hoist. There is ample parking and designated disabled parking.  Accessible toilets with tracked hoisting is available. There is plenty of washing facilities after meeting the animals. All very clean. Plenty of parking facilities close to the activity park.  Hoisted changing table and disabled facilities open during working hours."
orchards the furniture people bristol,negative,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately away near Waitrose on Link Rd approximately 150m away. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
oreilly theatre oxford,negative,"The theatre is right inside Keble College.  It may be possible to contact the college in advance to reserve college parking, but we didn't have time to do this.  We parked easily on the street outside."
oriam edinburgh,positive,You can get the 25 or X25 bus from Edinburgh City Centre - it takes about 45 mins... There is accessible parking very near entrance of the facility. Be aware the car park can get very busy!
oriel makers gallery cardiff,positive,Bus links and several public car parks near by Disabled toilet ( no hoist)
oriental express cleethorpes,negative,It is located close to a bus route in which you have to cross a council run car park before having a steep incline to their own car park which only has one disabled parking place which is often used.  It is a case of get there early to get a free parking space in their own car park of have to pay for parking in the council run one.
oriental express cleethorpes,positive,The only let down here is there is no emergency cord apart from that the toilet is accessible very easily for a disabled person on their own  although door may be a problem for the person to close on their own as opens outwards.
oriental inn derby,negative,There is a bus stop outside where the Ilkeston Flyer stops coming from Derby & towards Ilkston. There is no crossing and the dropped kerb is quite a walk away so crossing the road to other side is a challenge. The other side of road is quite steep so you'll need to be okay with a gradient. To get the bus towards Derby I recommend going right and not left. The left bus stop there isn't much space for a bus to deploy the ramp. There is quite a walk though.   There are no accessible parking bays. 
oriental museum durham,negative,"Not easy to get to on public transport, but with about 30 minute walk from the city centre. There is one accessible parking space just outside the front door."
origano edinburgh,negative,Leith Walk so no parking outside but possibly available on side streets? Lots of buses and taxi can stop right outside.
origano edinburgh,positive,"Fair amount of space. An emergency call button, which I'd never seen before. It's placed near a bus stop with many different routes.  The parking isn't good. The loos were fine."
oslo oslo,positive,"We arrived by cruise ship and travelled by the Metro into the city centre. It was the equivalent of £7 per person return. There are only certain lines that have wheelchair access and there is a lift down to the platform. The floor of the carriage was level with the platform if you made sure to wait at the centre of the platform. However there was about a four inch gap to get over. The front wheel of my scooter got caught on the gap but passengers came to my aid and helped me over. My friend with her powered wheelchair had no trouble as her wheels were larger. Would you believe it McDonald’s and Burger King had accessible toilets with three steep steps to get in. The five stars are for the Nespresso chain of coffee shops. Great access, good circulation space. Everyone joined in rearranging furniture and there was a top class loo. Ask at the counter for the code. "
osteria del tempo perso edinburgh,negative,See above Parking is available but they're often full as the restaurant is located on a busy street in Brunsfield.
osteria del tempo perso edinburgh,positive,Disabled toilet pointed out as we arrived. Not used.
osteria margherita rome,negative,"Plenty of room in the car park (which fills up pretty quickly) but there is a long walk to the main door which is round the side, few problems though once you are inside."
otter pool barn holiday home ilfracombe,positive,"We were able to drive into and turn in the dedicated car park with ease. In our opinion this area is big enough to accommodate several minibuses or at least six cars without obstructions. The site is flat with easy access level pathways into the accommodation and around the site. The Barn is located a short drive from the centre of Ilfracombe which has a number of town centre and beach car parks. As with 'Access' above, all loos have been designed with the disabled in mind. There is also a room designed for a 'live-in' carer if this is needed."

our bench accessible self catering cottages lymington,positive,"The property is easy to find by car, and only a short drive from the local shops in Lymington.  The onsite parking made loading\unloading from our wheelchair accessible vehicle very easy and safe for both of us. A wonderful large wet room with plenty of space around the toilet.  Grab rails on both sides of the toilet, and a sink basin that could be adjusted up or down to suit the height needs of the user.  Very clean and tidy.

Drove the route was easy  Had a commode but plenty of room in wet room Own drive and easy to park and load and unload wheelchair Full wet room and wide access There is allocated parking on the level with tarmac. We didn't use any public transport so can't comment A good height with foldable rails to either side. We found the accommodation easily with the aid of a Sat Nav.  I was the driver of my brother's wheelchair accessible vehicle and parking was not a problem We had brought our own toilet frame which we used as my brother, who is a wheelchair user, had broken his foot in November and was not steady on his feet and we used this in conjunction with those available in the property Parked on the drive which is flat. Bus goes along the road outside. Large wet room with toilet and grab rails, plenty of space to turn and access and very clean. The parking space is in front of the entrance to the house. Plenty of space to park in a dedicated off road area just yards from the front door. Very large wet room with fold down rail to the left of the toilet. The wash basin can be raised/lowered very easily so can be used by all. A great feature. Parked outside the door of my accessible accommodation and enjoyed my stay and guided walk. Walk including an access loo - needed my radar key, but it was great - we actually went past two! We drove and were coming from East Anglia using the A12, M25 and M3 We are getting the measure of changing places toilet as Clacket lane(M25) has them East Bound only and Fleet Westbound only. South Mimms also has changing places. Have a radar key  Tesco's at new Milton has a Changing Places WC and Milford on Sea are also in the process of building one( likely opening Easter 2020)"
our place stirling,negative,"Had to go up a ramp, around a corner and avoiding a pillar - a 5 point turn. Tiny room with baby change where space for a transfer should be. So small that once my small scooter was in, the basket was over the toilet! Red cord was tied up. I left a red cord card on it. "
our place stirling,positive,"Some parking in the street, 3 minutes to both train and bus station. "
out of the blue drill hall edinburgh,positive,On street parking right outside the door was a great find. I came on the local bus - all local buses are wheelchair accessible - and the stop on Leith walk was only a short distance for me to wheel along. On street parking right outside the door. Loads of buses stop nearby on Leith Walk. There is an accessible loo near the entrance. Fairly spacious and plenty of room for my powerchair. May be a but tight with a carer / PA. Good accessible toilet in the foyer area.
overgate centre dundee,positive,We walked to the Overgate. There were many car parks that were accessible and many disabled car spaces. There was a large easily accessible toilet. It was clean and tidy and had hand rails.  We didn't get the opportunity to have a further look. 
ox184 edinburgh,negative,"OX184 is located in the Cowgate area of Edinburgh which can be a little challenging to access without a car or taxi. There are some less steep streets nearby which can offer a route down to the restaurant, but there are no buses that pass by directly. parking on the street, no nearby bus stops so only really accessible on foot. Cowgate isn't the easiest of places to get to, a number 2 bus will take you to grassmarket and then you can go along Cowgate to get to the restaurant but the pavements are narrow and fairly bumpy. The best access and least steep root from the Royal Mile would be to go down St. Mary's Street. There is very limited parking on and near the Cowgate but there are some spaces near St. Mary's Street. Tricky to find parking - theres some on side streets but a bit of a challenge. Great if you're arriving by car as you can pull up outside to drop off. Plenty of nearby streets to park with a Blue Badge. If you're walking, or wheeling, the Ox184 nestles below the High Street in the Cowgate area. You need to negotiate the sloped streets and pathways. A bus service does service the Grassmarket which is a level walk some ten minutes away. Optionally, you could grab a taxi (all the Black cabs are wheelchair accessible) and drive to the door. The accessible loo was good and spotlessly clean. It was let down by the absence of a door handle to pull to open the door. On first use it was locked and they key kept behind the bar. For some reason the hand dryer was on the opposite side of the room from the sink - not great wheeling with wet hands or managing your powerchair controls with wet hands. Fix this and the venue could easily become a five star venue!"
ox184 edinburgh,positive,"Once inside, the accessible toilet is directly to the right of the level entrance and is at the end of the bar. The staff keep a key for the toilet behind the bar, but as the toilet is next to them they should see you straight away. The toilet itself is spacious and clean. good accessible toilet The accessible toilet is on the right of the accessible entrance, it is locked but the key is kept behind the bar (probably because the other toilets are upstairs and a little out of the way). I didn't use it myself but heard good reports! Great. Easily accessible near the entrance. Two small improvements would help - a better handle on the door and for the red cord to touch the floor would be great. Otherwise clean and tidy! Fine. It has a key which is kept behind the bar to prevent others using it but the staff kept it open for us.   Only gripe is the loo could do with having a handle on the outside."
oxburgh hall kings lynn,positive,There is limited disabled car parking on a compacted surface suitable for wheelchairs and scooters. Its only a few metres from the entrance .
oxfam bookshop london,positive,Westminster Station is nearby and is fully step-free. Several bus routes serve nearby Victoria Street.

oxford playhouse oxford,positive,"There is ample on-street disabled parking outside the venue.

On street disabled parking around the venue is plentiful and easy to find."

oxo tower wharf london,positive,Individual places to eat and drink within the Tower have accessible toilets.
oyo sheffield metropolitan hotel sheffield,positive,"Disabled car parking spaces were available in front of the hotel. Unfortunately, for most of our visit, deliveries and incorrect parking meant wheelchair user had to take a small diversion to get to the hotel door (not a big deal... unless it's raining).  You may be charged for the parking. "
oz bar edinburgh,negative,Some on street parking and it should be fine if you have a Blue Badge. I walked (wheeled) down from George IV Bridge where there are plenty of accessible buses going back and forth.
paddy scotts poole,positive,B&Q staff actively involved with monitoring blue badge bays. Just mention that you've seen an abuser and they will sort it. Very good Loo's
paesano pizza glasgow,negative,Relied on street parking when I went. So it's your luck whether you find parking on the street or not. There's spaces all the way up the street. Around 15 Limited amount of parking outside of the building due to where it is situated. Couldn't see any disabled parking at the entrance.
paesano pizza glasgow,positive,"Toilets were easy enough to find as there was a sign indicating where they were. In the ladies toilet, there was an extra large toilet for anyone that needed extra space.  There were also separate disabled toilets that were well equipped. "

paignton zoo paignton,positive,"We drove to the Zoo which had ample parking with many overflow car parks as you go up a hill. The disabled parking was located the closest to the zoo at the bottom of the hill to allow for easier access.  Buses directly to the Zoo run every twenty minutes from the town centre. I can't speak for wheelchair users or people with other disabilities, but from the perspective of someone with a visual-impairment, the toilets are very user-friendly."

There are also a few accessible parking bays on Horse Wynd.
palace of the parliament bucureti,negative,"Unfortunately the toilets were the only major let-down. I cannot confirm with any certainty that there are no disabled friendly toilets, but I personally did not find any and/or use any. However, the regular toilets were in fact spacious enough for me to use. The tour itself last around 1 hour - so it may be that access to a toilet isn't always essential. "

The Palace Theatre has one of the most excellent disabled toilets in the whole of Newark in my opinion, there is so much space to move around and they have got a superb sink, which enables me to rinse out my urine bottle after use, please be aware urine is not poured down the sink, the sink is just used to wash it out to try and get rid of any nasty smells!"

palais lascaris nice,positive,"The nearest tram stop is Cathedrale and from there is about a 5 minute walk. It's located in one of the side streets in Nice's Old Town and can be a little tricky to find.

Plenty of open air parking right by the front door, including dedicated disabled parks. Apart from needing a confirmed parking space with  extra space on passenger side, we had no specific requests.  But while we were there, a Swiss party with disabled guests arrived, who needed much more space to park and unload etc.  They had called in advance, and the hotel was very happy to accommodate them.  We know this, because the staff  let us know, so that we would not park in the space allocated to them."
park theatre london,positive,"The theatre is a couple of minutes walk from Finsbury Park tube/ train station. The nearest step free tube is Highbury and Islington and then a bus journey (no 4 or 19 from Highbury Corner). At present there is building work taking place at Finsbury Park Station to enable it to become step free by 2019. There are spacious disabled accessible toilets come baby changing facilities. I used the toilet on the 1st floor, opposite the lift, it has grab rail and an emergency alarm. The cord was wrapped round on of the grab rails. I unravelled it and informed one of the members of staff who said she would follow it up."
parkgate shopping park parkgate,negative,"There are two unisex toilets also located near pizza hut which are equipped with both disabled and mother and baby equipment. However, many of the shops and restaurants such as Mothercare, Morrisons and Costa Coffee for example also provide customer toilets. The accessibility of these toilets vary between the different shops."
parkgate shopping park parkgate,positive,"There are many disabled parking spaces on each side of the car park. There is a free bus that runs between Parkgate and Rotherham Interchange every 12 minutes Monday to Saturday. This is a low floor bus and takes you right into the center of the complex. Alternatively, several bus routes run past the bus stop immediately outside of the entrance to the complex."
parkroyal on pickering singapore,positive,Hired an accessible taxi to and from the airport. Accessible train stations nearby  Accessible bedroom had plenty of space and power points to charge my chair. Bathroom was wet room with ample space for even a large chair plus carer.  Grab rails and ciollapsible bench.  Kept very clean and tidy
parkside victoria square public toilets paignton,positive,The accessible toilet is a 2 minute walk from Paignton Railway Station and close to the bus station.
parkstone health centre poole,negative,Only two disabled parking spaces. But the council plans to close this site and develop it. 
parkway cinemas cleethorpes,negative,Some designated disabled parking at the front with dropped kerb.  Sadly there is often misuse of these spaces and the staff can't enforce the use of the spaces and weren't very helpful when I last went and pointed out to the manger that there was no blue badge parking spaces and 3 spaces where taken up by cars not displaying a blue badge. All I got told was it was a courtesy to offer disabled parking spaces.
parkway cinemas cleethorpes,positive,Accessible toilets with plenty of grab rails and enough room for carers to come in and plenty of room to manoeuvre my wheelchair in. The emergency red cord also hung freely to the floor. Only downside was that the toilet roll was at a bit of a reach. Not always clean and tidy. plenty of parking throughout with 6 disabled parking spots which are located at the front of the building. However due to the large and flat car park if the disabled spots are being used there are plenty of other spots to park in.  There are 2 disabled toilets both with adequate turning space for a wheelchair user plus a carer if needed. The toilets have plenty of grab rails. Noted them to be clean and tidy. 
parque santiago 6 arona,positive,"If you are staying in a nearby hotel, you may not need to use transport.  The streets nearby are all flat, and zebra crossings are found on all bigger roads. There is flat paved access to the Centre straight from the street.  The Shopping Centre has its own car park if you are using a car, this has several marked disabled bays.  Local buses (which are green in colour) all have disabled access. The buses themselves can lower to let people on, the set of doors in the middle of the bus are wider which allow easier access. There are disabled spaces and seats in the bus.  There are also lots of taxis, and for a different way to travel there is also a fun train - which is driven on the road - which transports people from the busier tourist streets to the Centre. I'm not sure if this would be accessible if using a wheelchair, but may suit people with other needs, and anyone who enjoys being a big kid!! The Accessible (and all) toilets are on the basement level, which is also where the main carpark is.  There is a lift as well as stairs to this level.  The accessible toilet isn't just the usual standard white room, the decor looks good and it is very clean."
parroquia de san amaro puerto de la cruz,positive,Buses stop close by. I took a taxi here and it stopped just outside.
parsons close recreation ground leighton buzzard,negative,No disabled parking other than in town car parks.
parsons close recreation ground leighton buzzard,positive,Newly developed
partick railway station glasgow,negative,"There is an accessible toilet just beside the stations main entrance door. It does have a sign on the door, but otherwise I didn't think it was overly obvious it was there - when I asked, staff happily pointed it out.  It opens with a radar key, but if you ask the staff they will open it for you if you don't have a key yourself.  This is the only public toilet, so does get used by everyone not only those with access needs. In a station as busy as this it's a shame there aren't a few more toilets. (there are also 2 toilets in the Morrisons cafe).  It was a functional accessible toilet - not the prettiest, but clean enough. If using a bigger power wheelchair and if you also needed a carer with you, I think space would be fairly tight, though possible.  The toilet had a fixed support bar on the wall to your right (when sitting on the toilet) and a raise/lower support bar to your left. There were additional support bars on the walls.   There is a hand-drier machine on the wall.  The emergency cord reached the floor. "
partick railway station glasgow,positive,"I guess most people at Partick Train Station will be planning to travel by train!  There is a car park just outside with a pay-and-ride scheme, but the car park does tend to get pretty full pretty quickly. There is also a carpark for Morrisons Supermarket just next to it but you can only park there for a few hours.   There is a bus station just outside.   The underground is in the same building - I haven't reviewed this but I don't think it would be accessible for someone using a wheelchair, but might be OK for some people with different disabilities.  There is a station car park at the side of the station. You also park at Morrison's car park but there is a 2 hour time limit, there are lots of buses as the bus station is next to the train station. there is a disabled toilet next to the ticket office you have to ask staff for the key."
passorn edinburgh,positive,"It is quite close to Lothian Road where a lot of buses drop off, which is what we use to get there. There are also lots of smaller side roads around which I imagine you can park with a blue badge."
pasta romagna leeds,positive,"Middle of town, so easy to get to using public transport. Not as easy with a car, due to lack of parking spaces in the city centre. "
patisserie jacob edinburgh,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. The venue is close to Haymarket Train Station and Tram stop, and well served by Lothian buses 12, 26 and 31"
patisserie valerie edinburgh,negative,We came as pedestrians. Parking likely tricky given it's on a busy road but there are lots of buses running up North Bridge.
patisserie valerie edinburgh,positive,Large and clean. Only draw back is the table situated near to the door but it's was just far enough not to cause a problem. It might do if someone was sitting there though.
patisserie valerie kingston upon thames,negative,Not really sure. Walked into town It is very difficult to get the disabled toilet at the back of the shop. The toilet is small and you are unable to get one wheelchair in.
patisserie valerie london,negative,"No step-free stations nearby, Clapham Junction is a long way off, many buses go past this café, and I wouldn't dream of attempting to park in this area. The accessible toilet is spacious, elegant and modern. But there are two problems with it. The bins were placed in the wheelchair transfer area (see my picture below), this is the wrong place, it is emphatically *not* spare space, it's needed for a wheelchair user to park in order to make a sideways transfer to the toilet. The bins should be placed elsewhere. Secondly, the red emergency cord was MUCH too short - see my photo below. So silly and thoughtless! The red emergency cord should hang all the way to the floor so that it can be used in the event of someone falling over! This café is in the heart of Covent Garden and although there are many bus services in the surrounding area, none of them will drop you near the café. There are no step-free stations nearby."
patisserie valerie london,positive,"Tottenham Court Road station is step-free and only a few blocks away, Green Park Station is step free and about half a mile away. Several bus routes will drop you near Cambridge Circus, which is just round the corner. "
patounis soap factory corfu,positive,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced. Plenty of local buses stop close by. I took a taxi from my hotel.
paul london,positive,Many buses run up and down Piccadilly and Green Park Station is quite nearby and is completely step-free (if the lifts are working - check before you travel!).
pauls london,negative,This café is in the heart of Covent Garden. Covent Garden tube station is not step-free. There are no step-free stations nearby. There are plenty of buses in the surrounding area but none of them will drop you in the heart of Covent Garden.
paultons park home of peppa pig world romsey,positive,"Loads of disabled bays that are wide enough and right beside entrance and flat surface between park entrance and car parking.  Large, spacious, modern and clean with accessible entrances and nice changing places toilets.  Also, never had to travel far to find one as there are loads of accessible loos around the park, which are easily accessed and can be found using a paper map or the phone app which gives you distance and goa walking directions. Lots and lots of parking right by the entrance, although some has a pavement to get up onto so pick your space wisely! Fabulous, clean, well signposted, roomy toilets. Plenty of parking for blue badge holders right next to the park entrance. Lots of space in the toilets for changing, and there is a changing room available with a hoist near the main entrance. Disabled spaces are at the main entrance to the park. Seemed to be plenty of space I didn't use the toilets here, however I am giving full stars as there is an adult changing toilet at the main entrance."
pavilion shopping mall kuala lumpur,positive,It has ramps to the entrance of the mall from the parking and a doorman to assist into the mall for disable people. It has accessible and spacious toilet which has grab rails.
pawsnrun forfar,negative,"You can only really get to this dog park by car as it is located in the middle of the countryside, maybe there’s a bus that goes nearby but I can’t comment on any public transport.  To enter the car park you have to enter a secure gate with a code that you get sent with the confirmation of your booking in a email. The gate is quite big and looks heavy, if you are a wheelchair user I would suggest having someone with you to help open the gate because as well as the heaviness of the gate the ground surface of the car park is difficult to drive on so it would be very difficult to get out and in your car again.  Once you’re in the car park you lock the gate again and then it’s secure to let your dog out. Now I have to say I really struggled to drive my powerchair in the car park as the ground is covered in medium sized stones which you can see in an image below. I had to get my carer to reverse my car as close to the entrance to the dog park as possible so I didn’t have to drive on the stones too much and my wheels were spinning trying to get up my ramp I had to get my carer to put my car at a flatter area."
peacock rooms cafe dunfermline,negative,Access limited by wooden baby changing unit and shortened red cord. No space to side transfer due to position of baby changing unit b
peacock rooms cafe dunfermline,positive,There was parking close at hand but we walked through the park to get there.  4 designated spaces in car park next to cafe. 
peacocks paisley,positive,Parking available on first level of car park
peak wildlife park leek,positive,"The car park was quite full, so had to park on the additional parking which still left plenty of space but the ground was uneven. But overall it was good, with staff in the car park to help and free parking for all. A few loos around the park and were all accessible."
pedmore primary school stourbridge,negative,There is quite a few disabled parking spaces There are two disabled toilets in the whole school
peebles hydro hotel peebles,negative,"Disabled spaces, are on the opposite side of the drive to the entrance, they back on to the sloop of the garden, so impossible at reverse into if you need safe access to the boot.  If you park nose first then getting access means you are out into the driveway and vulnerable to cars driving up to the hotel.  The spaces are not directly in front of the entrance but off to the side, meaning a greater walking distance.  Poor and unsafe basically"
peebles hydro hotel peebles,positive,"We got here by taxi - it would be a bit of a walk from the public bus. I don't know about the disabled parking.  Parking spaces right at the door, plus the hotel staff recognise that not everybody disabled has a blue badge and still try ensure easy access, would phone in advance during holidays or weekends to let them know you have requirements as they are very busy. The room itself was very spacious, with lots of room for my wheelchair.  John showed us the bathroom, which was also large with a bath and a walk in shower.  However there were  no grab rails, either in the shower or at the toilet or seat for the shower.  On mentioning my concerns about the shower to John, he promptly went and got us a plastic chair that I could use.  The second room had ample room for my wheelchair.  The bathroom was a proper wet room, with handrails at the shower (showerheads at two levels) There was a seat that could either be used in the shower or the sink. The loo was a proper raised one, again with handrails."
peggy porschen london,positive,"The nearest tube station is Victoria, which is also now step free. From the tube/ train station it is a good 5 - 8 minutes walk. There are several buses that stop close by. On the first visit it can be a little bit hard to find. However if you walk from the train station along the main road to Victoria Coach Station. The café itself is on Ebury Street, a side street at the back of Victoria Coach Station. The café is very pink and flowery and can be seen in the distance when you turn into Ebury Street. "
peggy scotts restaurant forfar,negative,"Blue badge spaces for 1 car and 1 motor bike! Not good enough. If your bothered to paint a yellow wheel chair on the tarmac, you need to leave space around it clear to be usable. No signage the disabled toilet. Entrance tricky due to ice cream cabinet position. No transfer place due to bin position. Red cord trails on floor."
pen y bryn colwyn bay,positive,"The venue itself has a spacious & private car parking lot, with one dedicated disabled parking space. On a busy evening, only the one disabled parking space could be seen as a problem, however, the other spaces are close by and suitable sizing for disabled access. There is a slight incline which may cause slight difficulty when getting in and out of a car but nothing too problematic. This venue has only lost one star due to public transport difficulties as it's located out of the main town and close by to housing. A disabled taxi would be more useful, to bring you to the door of the venue.  There was plenty of space to manoeuvre in the toilet, grab rails in suitable places and plenty of space for a carer. The sink was located at a suitable height. The restaurant itself is quite large and spacious, and the toilets are separated therefore be sure to ask for a table nearby the toilets if the distance could cause a problem."
pen y cae inn pen y cae,positive,Has own car park; step free access along pavement from car park and in through the front door. Standard disabled toilet on the ground floor.
pencarrow house and gardens washaway,negative,"The toilet was good, with one omission, the door open inwards, which would prove a problem for a larger wheelchair."
pencarrow house and gardens washaway,positive,You really have to drive to this location
pendragon community trust northallerton,negative,"The nearest bus stop is on the Northallerton high street as this centre is on an industrial estate.  It would be advised to use a car to get here where possible.  Plenty of parking available.  Even if disabled spots taken, there is lots of on street parking and it is a quiet area,"
pendragon community trust northallerton,positive,This was very clean and tidy with full hoist and changing area.
penilee community centre glasgow,negative,Disabled parking isn't  that great at the  community centre.
penilee community centre glasgow,positive,Toilets are really good with a choice of 5 wheelchair accessible available.
penn station railway station baltimore,negative,Right in between several bus stops but no idea about disabled parking. Only one wheelchair accessible entrance (the side).  There isn't one - or at least not one marked as such. 
pennells garden centre grimsby,positive,There's a few Blue Badge Parking spots but ideally a couple more would be nice. Parking spots are right next to the store entrance. Dropped kerb on the entrance to the store. Its on a bit of a slope so I needed my carers help to push my wheelchair. Accessible toilet with room to move around in and fit a carer in. Plenty of grab rails. Found the emergency red cord hanging freely to the floor and left a Red Cord Card.  It was clean and tidy. There was also no pedal bins which is great when you don't have full use of your legs as I've found in so many accessible loos pedal bins and they you're left wondering how to open the bin! There was also a good size clinical waste pin. The toilets where easy-ish to find.
pennells garden centre lincoln,negative,Limited spaces Good but shared with baby change facilities
pennington flash country park leigh,positive,"This is a country park with lots of car parking spaces. If they are full drive to the bottom of the road and there is also car parking in the pub car park too. There is parking in the entrance to the park and also further by the lake too. This is like the Rolls Royce of public toilets. The toilets were huge and I could not believe how much state of the art equipment had been funded for this park: changing beds, overhead tracking hoist, two showers (fully accessible), loads of grab rails in all of the right places. More than anything it was clean, well maintained and i just wish all public toilets were like this."
penniwells riding for the disabled centre elstree,positive,There is ample general parking on site although this surface is a little uneven.In addition there is specific  disabled parking with easy assess to on site facilities and ramps. There are ramps from the car parking area and the yard area  into the on site toilet facilities.All surfaces are no slip and well maintained. Toilets are well maintained and clean.There are toilet facilities for able-bodied and physically disabled client.
pennyhill park bagshot,negative,"For this review of the Spa, then we can only offer a few marks, although to be fair it’s a lovely drive to get to the hotel, and along to the hotel itself where one disabled bay is available right by the hotels entrance, but it is quite a walk from hotel to the separate Spa and health club. You cannot drive down to see the Spa, so bear this in mind."
pennyhill park bagshot,positive,"The A30 leads to a beautiful driveway that awaits as it leads to the archway and pleasing gates ahead. There is a public disabled toilet for you, close to reception entry, very clean and nicely tiled out, with grab rail, and if you have to, you could get a wheelchair inside."
pennywell all care centre edinburgh,positive,"We drove, there was disabled parking at the door"
penshurst place and gardens penshurst,negative,You need a car to reach Penshurst Place and the disabled car parking is clearly sign posted. There are 6 - 8 disabled parking spaces but these are on thick gravel which is very difficult to wheel over.
penshurst place and gardens penshurst,positive,There are two (one at the visitors entrance by the cafe) and a second in the courtyard near to the main restaurant. Clean and everything was within reach.
pensthorpe natural park fakenham,positive,Parking is on gravel but gives way to hard metalled pathways The car park is large and has a rough surface but fine for a wheelchair or scooter. There are disabled spaces as you enter the car park. It’s reasonably well signed. Very clean disabled toilets with baby changing area. 
pentahotel reading,negative,The hotel doesn't have any parking and the train station is about a mile away. Reading is pretty good for accessibility but it can be tricky if you don't know the area.
pentahotel reading,positive,The accessible toilet is good quality.
pentland hills regional park edinburgh,positive,There were 3 spacious accessible parking spaces.
pentland lodge house thurso,positive,There is a gravel car park which can house 10+ cars easily. The toilet has drop down rails - I can park in front of the toilet and transfer over and there is room in a self propelled chair to side transfer too.
peoples history museum manchester,negative,Standard 'disabled' toilet iirc.
peoples palace museum glasgow,positive,"I went on the ""Hop on Hop off"" bus (minus the hopping). There was ample on street parking around the green.  Lots of room to turn.. All rails in place. Red cord fine. The only toilet I have seen with their own prominent red cord sign. "
pepper saint ontiod london,negative,"The accessible toilet was disappointing. See my photo below. (1) There was no toilet paper and the double toilet-paper-dispenser was hanging wide open (2) The red emergency cord was MUCH too short, it hung about as far as chest height if you're standing up. This is wrong and dangerous. This cord should reach all the way to the floor so that it can be reached in the event of someone falling over in the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back. This is really putting people in serious danger. "
pepper saint ontiod london,positive,"The pub is very near Crossharbour DLR Station, which is - like all DLR stations - fully step-free.   I wouldn't try parking in the area. "
peppers aberdare,positive,Travelled by car and parked in council car park at the back of the venue. Plenty of disabled bays and free to park. Easy to find with plenty of manoeuvre space. Room for a carer very neat and clean. Fitted with grab rails.  Not a changing places toilet
pere lachaise cemetery paris,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Nearby Place Gambetta is extensively served by wheelchair accessible buses.  The cemetery is best entered by wheelchair at the gate at the end of Avenue du Père Lachaise, a short wheel or walk from Place Gambetta.  "
pergamonmuseum berlin,negative,on Museum Island which in itself is largely accessible  and although there is a street near the museum it would be difficult I think to park but all on the level and you could be dropped nearby by taxi or bus ; area around Museum is electric buggy /wheelchair friendly
pergamonmuseum berlin,positive,groundfloor disabled toilet – toilet accessible thatheavy doors get through from reception area
perrywood garden centre colchester,positive,We travelled by car. Easy to find and not far from the famous Tiptree jam factory. 
perth college academy of sport and wellbeing perth,positive,There are multiple car parks on the college campus and multiple bus stops as well which serve Perth City Centre. There are drop off/pick up points at the entrance to the Academy of Sport & Wellbeing.  There are multiple accessible toilets on the ground floor. 
perth concert hall perth,negative,There are only 3 disabled bays close by which are invariably in use as M&S is across the road.There is a drop of zone which is fine if using a taxi. If you are using your own car I think it would be a struggle to find a disabled bay close to venue.
perth concert hall perth,positive,"Disabled parking is directly near the front door. The accessible loo was great, good signage, all brand new and exceptionally clean. Disabled toilets very good, large room and very clean and modern."
perth museum art gallery perth,negative,"No specific parking for the Museum but parking nearby on Mill Street and George Street for blue badge holders.  Private parking also but cannot use blue badge, make sure to check it is a PKC parking space.  Number 7 bus stops right near venue "
perth museum art gallery perth,positive,"Good but in Male and Female toilets.  Would cause slight issue if Carer  is opposite sex.  Clean, tidy and presentable.  "
perth racecourse perth,positive,"Car parking was great, right at the main walk way and plenty disabled bays.  I took half a mark off as it was on grass which wasn't too easy for one of our group in a manual chair.  Also one had gravel which was filling in a hole.  This was so loose that his electric chair became stuck and he needed help to get it out. I only used the toilet in the restaurant which was great.  My only issue was the main door to the toilet area didn't have a disabled sign so I wasn't sure where it was and the doors were very heavy, I had to ask a fellow guest to help me. I spent ages thinking of a wee fault that I could include and honestly, there wasn't many.. it was a fantastic day! But if I was going to be a critic then I would say that the disabled car park was about 2 minutes away from gate C which is where we needed to go but we needed to cross a road that cars use and then go down another road which cars also used but that is being very critical, I didn't have major problem!  The toilets are easy enough to find and not just staff, but in general the people who attend house racing are so nice! Two men showed me where the toilet was and waited outside until I was finished!"
perth railway station perth,negative,The accessible toilets are inside the gender specific toilets which isn't great for someone with a PA or Carer of the opposite sex.  There is a tight corner to turn to get into the male toilets.  There is an automatic door on the toilet doors. 
perth railway station perth,positive,"There were disabled car parking spaces directly outside the train station entrance. Again, the only problem for me was there was only one drop down kerb."
petasfield cottages hertford,positive,"Great secure parking, car park accessed via a coded electric gate. Owners let us unload at side of cottages for ease. Disabled parking clearly signed. Fully equipped wet Room, , plenty of room to manoeuvre, grab rails. Clean, light & airy. The toilet at the cottage was fully accessible Hard standing and spacious parking area. Some set to shingle. Good use of space and accessible for all but the biggest powered chairs. There is disabled parking as you enter near stables but we were allowed to park next to accommodation which was a great help.  Gate pin code entry too so no concerns about security of car. Great toilet/ wet room with grab rails and shower chair if needed. Disabled parking is signposted and on level ground, only a stones throw from the cottages. Accessible toilet in the cottage wet room."
peter jones london,negative,"I wouldn't try parking here. There are no step-free stations nearby, though if you can get out of your wheelchair and use an escalator, you can use Sloane Square tube station, which has escalators running directly between the street and the platforms, with no intermediate fixed steps. Many bus routes serve Sloane Square and King's Road. There are accessible toilets. The ones I used on my visits had two problems:  1) Basement Toilet.   (a) The red emergency cord had been thoughtlessly shortened with a complex knot. This means that it can't be reached by anyone who falls to the floor in the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back. The red emergency cord must hang freely all the way to the floor.  (b) A big rubbish bin has been thoughtlessly placed in the wheelchair transfer area. This area is NOT free space for stuff like bins. It must be kept clear of obstacles so that a wheelchair user can park there!  See my pictures below.  2) Third Floor Toilet  (a) This toilet is kept locked and there is no signage on it telling you to seek assistance from staff. This meant that when I found it locked I sensibly assumed it was occupied. It wasn't. After a very long wait, I was approached by a member of staff asking if I wanted to use the toilet. Yes I did! So she unlocked it for me. She explained that they keep it locked so that only disabled people use it, without having to wait for anyone else who might be using it. But the result of keeping it locked is a long wait anyway before staff spot you and bring the key.   This is is contrary to the spirit and letter of the Equality Act 2010, which makes it unlawful for service providers to treat disabled people less favourably for a reason related to their disability. Blocking access to only the accessible toilet by locking it is treating disabled people less favourably for a reason related to their disability.  (b) The red emergency cord in this toilet is too short. This is thoughtless and dangerous. See my picture below.  "
peterborough cathedral peterborough,negative,"There is an accessible toilet but it's not in the Cathedral itself, it's in the adjacent Learning Centre. It's not satisfactory:  1) The Learning Centre closes promptly at 4pm, long before the Cathedral closes. If you need an accessible toilet after 4pm you will need to get a member of staff to unlock the Learning Centre for you. On the day I visited, this was not made clear to me, so I was left with the very disagreeable impression that disabled people cannot use the toilet after 4pm, which is not actually the case. Better communication is needed on this.    2) The toilet cubicle is narrow and there isn't really room to manoeuvre in your wheelchair. I found it a very tight squeeze, and that's in a fairly compact wheelchair. People with larger wheelchairs will really struggle.  "
peterborough cathedral peterborough,positive,"Peterborough Station provides full step-free access and extremely friendly assistance, there are modern (2013) lifts to all platforms. The station is about 10 minutes walk/roll from the Cathedral. Be careful - the route is very badly signposted and you may get temporarily very lost."
peterhead prison museum peterhead,positive,"Drove.  No problems, but if not using Sat-Nav would be worth consulting road map or web to check directions Stagecoach bus stop available directly outside of the building. There were only 3 disabled car parking spaces. The toilet was reasonably large and had everything that I needed. "
peters yard edinburgh,negative,"Spacious loo, doubles as baby change and general toilet. Red cord was tied up near the floor; also push button alarm."
petit train de cannes cannes,positive,"The starting and finishing point for Le Petit Train de Cannes is on La Croisette near Palais des Festivals.  The train station is about a 10 minute walk away, and it's on a slight slope down from the station to the sea front. There are also a number of buses that run along La Croisette or stop nearby. Sorry unable to comment about car parking, but assume it would be expensive given the location."
petra nights tours amman,negative,"Again mixed.  Hotels generally good, restaurants and tourist venues not so."
petra nights tours amman,positive,"We booked a private tour by car.  The driver loaded/unloaded and pushed my wheelchair which made the trip very easy.  There was also an option of a wheelchair accessible vehicle, but this was not available at the time of our visit"
pets at home derby,negative,Public transport is limited.  There are three marked bays outside but they're often full.  Disabled parking bays outside.  Public transport limited but the H1 and the Park & ride does go near by. 
pets at home elgin,positive,Opposite Asda and lots of dedicated disabled parking spaces near the entrance to the shop. 
pets at home falkirk,positive,"There is a small car park directly outside of the Pet Shop with accessible spaces. There are also bus stops very close by, and the local train station is just across the road."
pettigrew tea rooms cardiff,negative,There is no car park. It is on the front of an extremely busy main road. There are bus stops nearby but I doubt an electric wheelchair or mobility scooter would be able to board the buses. The best way to access it is from Bute Park or from the main road and not from a vehicle. It is practically impossible to stop to be dropped off as the road is so busy and dangerous.
petworth house and park petworth,positive,"Plenty of blue badge spaces in the main carpark. Website and telephone system mentions blue badge parking in the town which is closer and provides you with sat nav code but there are only 2 spaces. There is a disabled toilet by the main ticket office which is spacious. The second toilet is located in the servants quarter not far from the restaurant and is very smart with an electric door, toilet flush, taps and soap dispenser. Both toilets were very clean."
pfingstegg rodelbahn grindelwald,positive,Parking is fine but there is a step into the ccable-car station at the bottom only. There is plenty of space in the cable-car for a wheelchair. Loos were easy to find at the top station
phoenix cafe findhorn forres,positive,"There are several areas close by for disabled parking, however, given the amount of visitors who come to the Foundation, I feel that there could be more disabled bays available. Despite this, there are other non disabled parking spaces which may be available.  There are also buses to Findhorn Village from Inverness, Aberdeen and points in between. The accessible toilet was spotlessly clean with plenty of remove to spin round in a wheelchair and for a carer. There were also grab rails and a red emergency cord which were in easy reach.  The only reason I have not rated this with 5 stars is that it is shared with baby changing and the gents, meaning that it might not always be available."
phoenix cinema london,positive,Car Satisfactory on ground floor. Lift to cinema upstairs.
phoenix park dublin,positive,"Phoenix Park is easily accessed by public transport, The Red Line of the Luas (Tram) stops at Heuston Station which is within a 5 minute wheel of the park.  An accessible toilet is available in the Visitor Centre. "
phoenix theatre london,positive,"The loo was through a couple of doors nearby to my seat. Whilst the loo itself was basic but clean, the entrance was the grandest I've ever seen - see photo.  The loo had room for a wheelchair (just) but shape meant washbasin was right in front whilst using the loo, making grab rails  bit difficult to reach. But it was manageable."
piassa bar restaurant leeds,positive,Can easily park on the street next to the restaurant as I have done every time I have visited 
piazza shopping centre paisley,positive,with 7 designated parking bays on level one of the car park adjacent to the lifts Accessible toilet situated across from the café in the centre of the piazza access is gained by getting a member of staff
piccadilly circus london,positive,"Public transport is good with lots of buses, taxis and the nearby underground."

pier 64 penarth,positive,Large carpark opposite. Car park opposite the venue has disabled spaces and flat access across the road
pierogowy raj krakow,positive,"Very close to Rynek Glowny, the main square and about a 10 minute walk from Krakow's main railway station. There are several trams which stop close by. I didn't use the trams when I was in Krakow, but I saw plenty of them and they all appeared modern and had a wheelchair sign by one of the doors. Taxis are plentiful. "
piershill library edinburgh,negative,"there's no parking outside the library, unless you want to park at Iceland or Morrisons. there's good public transport links - the 4, 5, 15, 26 and more all stop nearby"
pig and pastry york,negative,There is one large toilet cubicle at the Pig and Pastry which is sufficient to say the size of the cafe is fairly small. It is down a narrow corridor however big enough for wheelchair access if needed. Not the  easiest access to a toilet but certainly able to do so.
pig and pastry york,positive,"The Pig and Pastry is just seconds away from a great car park, with disabled parking spaces extremely close to the entrance of the cafe, meaning parking wouldn't be a problem."
pigalle new york,negative,"They share toilets with the adjoining hotel, which did have disabled toilets, we were given a key card in order to open the door. However, the hotel was accessed by the restaurant through the raised seating area on the left. If a wheelchair user had wanted to use them, they would need to leave the restaurant and enter via the hotel entrance, which I would assume is wheelchair accessible, but I didn't double check."
pigneto metro station rome,positive,"As a transport station, this was excellent. Lifts were clearly signposted to get underground and to find your way back up to the street."
pigneto vegetable market rome,positive,"While the Metro is still to be completed, you can hop on Pigneto's fantastically accessible modern station to a connecting station closer to town. Alternatively, there are numerous bus stops and tram stops around the area."
pili palas nature world menai bridge,positive,"Well signposted from A55 and A5.  Designated area for blue badge parking - 4 bays,  near the entrance which has a good surface and is fairly flat.  Not sure about public transport. Large portacabin near the entrance with very clear sign.  Ramp up to it and access via radar key.  Rise and fall changing bed, mobile hoist.  There were some rails round the toilet and plenty of room to transfer.    You are asked not to leave nappies or pads in the bin in there and to please put them in a particular bin in the main building."
pillars of hercules organic farm shop cafe falkland,positive,"There is one accessible toilet with a shower (there are also camping facilities on site). Wide door and spacious inside. There is a small gradient up to the toilet.  very easy to find, and recently refurbished. Always very clean."

pinnies poppy seeds edinburgh,positive,Not applicable in my case 
pipe and glass beverley,negative,"We drove to the venue, I doubt if there is any public transport. There is a gravel car park opposite. This has a short steep ramp to the entrance and as I am in a wheelchair my husband had to take me down backwards. You can stop just outside the pub to drop off or pick up instead."
piperdam leisure resort dundee,positive,Car park spaces right outside the lodge within 5 steps All toilets are fully functional for all people as none up stairs
piramide metro station rome,positive,"There is a drop off point directly outside the station, and the terminal itself is a great way into and out of the city centre."
pirelli stadium burton upon trent,negative,The stand behind the goal had one disabled toilet and there were not enough toilet facilities for all the fans in the stand so some people were abusing the use of the disabled toilet by queuing outside it. The toilet was not well designed because it was very narrow so might make transfers a bit difficult. The facilities at the side of the goal were better but we did not see the toilets. Disable toilets available with radar key
pirelli stadium burton upon trent,positive,"Pirelli Stadium is a modern ground so there were quite a few disabled parking spaces right outside the ground. The entrance to the car park is located on Princess Way, Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, DE13 0AR. We got the last available disabled parking space so if you require a space you should ring up Burton Albion F.C directly to book one in advance. Plenty of disabled parking at stadium, which can be booked in advance. There is also ample parking in the streets around the ground"
pisa international airport pisa,positive,Disabled drop off area at airport good with 10+ spaces.
pitlochry dam visitor centre pitlochry,positive,"Clean, large and modern. There is a disabled toilet as you enter on the left hand side with plenty of room, well sign posted. There is also a separate ladies and gents toilet."
pitlochry festival theatre pitlochry,negative,"2 accessible toilets, Old style with handrails and a button to press for assistance  Space for carer but tight squeeze  Clean and tidy "
pitlochry festival theatre pitlochry,positive,8 designated parking spaces at the entrance with level access in a big car park. 
pitmedden garden ellon,positive,"We went by car, I don't think it would be easy via public transport due to location. Disabled parking out the front."
pitt rivers museum oxford,positive,"Only a few disabled parking spots but there are some outside the museum and space is tight in Oxford. They have done what they can. The museum is accessible. Large loos with grab rails, space for a carer, pull cord alarm. Easy to find. Clean and tidy. 3 wide accessible spaces.  Tel no on website to book ahead. Level access into museum.  Available but did not visit The accessible toilet I used, which was near the wheelchair-friendly entrance, was huge and perfectly in order in every way - see my picture below."
pittencrieff park dunfermline,negative,could be bigger but no emergency chord made me rate it a lot less as the toilets are not staffed
pittencrieff park dunfermline,positive,"We used the access at the north west end of the park ( drive through the main parking area )  , and you can then drive up to the Peacock building where there is additional disabled parking. From here there is a ramp into the café. We only used the toilets in the Peacock café but they were very clean and accessible , can't comment on other toilets within the park. toilets at the car park plenty of room Transport wise it was good. We were able to park right along side the entrance up toward the Abbey. There are other parking spots by the different entrances. It’s also a short walk from the town and the many buses plying their way around the town."
pittenweem anstruther,negative,There is some disabled parking available at the harbour.
pittenweem anstruther,positive,The public toilets beside the harbour do have a disabled toilet. The  toilet itself is tight for space but manageable with help.
pittodrie stadium aberdeen,negative,It all starts with there being very few disabled parking spaces so arrive early or be forced to park quite a fair bit away from the stadium. 
pittodrie stadium aberdeen,positive,No real complaints about the toilets very spacious and all have grab-rails and reachable help cords.   The toilet was basic but large so very easy to manoeuvre.
pizza edinburgh,positive,One accessible loo with good turning and transferring space. Drop down rails available along with a red cord card. 
pizza express buxton,negative,"On street disabled parking in the Crescent is free to blue-badge holders, as are most of the Pay and Display car parks in Buxton.  If you are lucky you can park on the street behind the restaurant (by the Old Courthouse shops)for a shorter distance to travel.  Both parking options involve going over uneven terrain to get into the restaurant."
pizza express buxton,positive,Fully accessible toilet
pizza express canterbury,negative,There is a ramp down to the toilet which was easy enough to get to. The toilet door is quite narrow though and there isn't much room inside... not enough room to turn an average-sized manual wheelchair around. Also the grab rail was very difficult to lower. It was clean though.
pizza express canterbury,positive,"We parked in the coach and motorhome car park for the whole day. It was about a 15 minute walk in, mostly along the riverside path. I have a serious aversion to nettles and although it was okay in April, I could see that in a month's time, I would be very unlikely to use that path."
pizza express derby,positive,There is free street parking near by if a blue badge holder. Derby Bus Station is 10 minute walk away.
pizza express edinburgh,positive,"There is a multi-story car park attached to the Ocean Terminal. I was visiting The Royal Yacht Britannia during my visit and they recommended I park on level E to allow easier access to here. On this level there was plenty of accessible parking however, it was very dark when driving around and difficult to see the parking spaces. I noticed later on that the lights are environmentally friendly lights that go on when you get near them which is good but, I feel it was quite dangerous, especially walking/driving out with the car with other cars driving around.  Due to not being from this area I don’t know anything about where or what public transport is available. Fort Kinnaird Retail Park has plenty parking and each outlet there has disabled parking spaces directly outside as well as 'free' parking in general. There are a variety of buses both from central Edinburgh and East Lothian with good service.  The loo was clean and a good size, I had no issue turning or transferring, I was unsure of its location within the building but staff were happy to direct me. "
pizza express leeds,positive,"Parked in the large car park, we were parked facing primark (again level) and could walk straight through, no problem Accessible disabled toilet, all the usual- handrails, pull cord, higher seat, low sink ect."
pizza express london,negative,When I asked were the toilets were a member of staff took me to a toilet which was on the same level as the restaurant. The toilet was also had baby changing facilities. The space is too small to accommodate a wheelchair. There was an emergency cord which didn't reach to the floor and a grab rail on the inside of the door which was unreachable when you were sat on the toilet. There was no grab rails near the toilet or sink area.  didn't see the other toilets but I saw a staircase and I assumed they were either up or down a flight of stairs. 
pizza express london,positive,"This branch of Pizza Express is on King's Road in Chelsea. The nearest tube station is Sloane Square, which on the accessibility tube map is marked with red ! saying that escalator access is only available between street and platform for those exiting the station. I travelled there by bus and there are several buses that stop very close by. Can't comment on state of it as didn't  use it.  But was impressed that there was one."
pizza express market square,negative,"The quality of the parking depends on the time of day that you go. It's in the centre of the town centre so can be busy. The parking, does not detract from the experience and it would be unfair to criticise the restaurant for the parking if it is busy in town."
pizza express renfrew,positive,"We drove to the centre and there was ample disabled parking on the Sunday afternoon that we visited. Parking is right beside the entrance to the centre, however Pizza Express is located several metres inside so there is still a short distance to walk."
pizza express rugby,negative,"There is space to temporarily park outside the restaurant however for a longer-stay disabled parking bay, they are round the corner at a further distance. There is flat ground throughout the town centre if you were to access the restaurant from already being in the town. There are no bus stops immediately by the restaurant, however there are within a 5-10 minute walk.  Accessible, clean disabled toilet downstairs, while other toilets are upstairs with only access via spiral staircase. "
pizza express twickenham,negative,"If you are desperate for an accessible toilet then there is one in this restaurant however the toilet is accessed by two doors and you can only open the second door by reversing back out the first door, once inside the toilet it is far too small to turnaround so locking the door is very difficult and there is pretty much no room if you need someone to help you in the toilet. There is no room to have side entry onto the toilet, there is a drop-down rail but it is only about 5 inches from wall. You have to reverse back out of the toilet because there is no room to turnaround, and the external door does not open easily so you may have to shout for help! The small toilet is made even more cramped because there was a huge nappy bin taking up loads of room!"
pizza express whitstable,negative,We live locally so did not take a car. I did not see any disabled parking but this maybe round the back. 
pizza express whitstable,positive,Really easy and large 
pizza geeks edinburgh,positive,We drove and the parking was good. There is on street parking which can be used for free with the blue badge.
pizza hut edinburgh,negative,At back of restaurant through one door. There was chairs around the area but staff moved them when they noticed I was struggling. No need for radar key or code to get in. Small space but enough for a power chair and carer to get in. Red cord hanging to the floor. Handrails on both sides and space under sink to roll under.
pizza hut huntington,negative,"There is no parking facilities available at this Pizza Hut as it is in the city centre which means in turn, there is no disabled parking making access even more difficult. There is a bus stop around the corner from this restaurant if using public transport."
pizza hut paisley,negative,"The disabled parking is relatively suitable. Disabled toilets aren't situated ideally as you have to go through two swing doors to the gents, females and the disabled toilets."
pizza punks glasgow,negative,"We drove here but we parked a few mins walk from the restaurant in West George Street. I'm not sure exactly about public transport, but it is near Central Station. Walk here. Not sure about transport."
pizza punks glasgow,positive,"There is an accessible toilet next to the bar. The other toilets are downstairs. On my first visit to this restaurant, it was very busy so it made getting through the small bar area a little difficult as there were lots of people standing. The toilet door opens out into the bar so if it's really busy it could be difficult. The second time I visited it was a lot quieter so it was easier to access. It would be great if this toilet had a radar lock as I feel it can be abused by people not necessarily needing to use it. It seems too convenient for people to use this toilet especially when they are sitting in the bar.  The toilet isn't huge, but it was enough room for my wheelchair and my companion. There isn't a great deal of space next to the toilet especially if you require side-on transfers. A fixed grab bar on one side of the toilet and a pull-down bar on the other side as well as an emergency pull cord. Unfortunately, the pull cord was tied up when I entered the toilet.    Great accessible loo on ground level. Clean and tidy."
pj live aberdeen,negative,"There were lots of toilets, but the disabled loos didn’t require a radar key so everyone was using them- lots of drunk men- so they were all very wet and dirty. They were also too small to turn in which is just shocking for a new venue. It meant I couldn’t do the door myself, but the toilet was really too small for a carer to be in as well. The bins had foot pedals too. "
placa reial barcelona,positive,"Right beside La Rambla where there are regular busses, parking spaces, taxis and access to the Metro."
planet kids cape town,negative,"We parked on the street, which is quiet so not a problem. There are ramps to the entrance of the building, but not ramps from the street up to the pavement. Not really a problem for us, but wheelchair accessible rather than wheelchair friendly parking."
platform 8 inverness,negative,"Grab rails around loo with red cord, long narrow with little room to manoeuvre a large wheelchair  Room for a carer.  This loo was very busy "
platform glasgow,positive,"Plenty of parking, and the x19bus is right there from the city centre  Lot's of parking within platform Toilets are accessible"
platty keswick,positive,A member of staff met us at the gate and we could drive all the way down to the path and park next to the cabin and beach. There was a disabled loo but I didn't use it.
playa club spa lanzarote,negative,"There was one bay opposite The location was excellent, just a few meters from a long promenade which had numerous shops, bars and restaurant.  A taxi rank was only about 15  meters away and bus stops within easy walking distance."
playa de las vista beach arona,positive,"Many people visiting the beach will likely be staying in a nearby hotel, therefore won't require transport. The entire beachfront has a esplanade very suitable for those using wheelchairs/scooters, and regular ramps to the beach itself or to the shops.  There is a small car park just across from the accessible area of beach, this has several marked disabled spaces. In general, I noticed there are a few disabled parking bays on most of the main/bigger streets.  The local buses (green ones) all can lower to allow people on/off easier. They have two sets of doors, one at the front where the driver is, and another in the middle of the bus. The middle set are wider and would provide better access, there are marked disabled spaces within the buses. There is both a man's and a woman's accessible toilet on the beach just next to the accessible platform. These are pretty good, but would be useful if they had a changing places toilet or changing room.  There are other accessible toilets along the esplanade. Not a changing places loo, but pretty good and loads of space."
playa de levante benidorm,negative,Toilet block on promenade but disabled toilet is locked and couldn't find out how to get the key I did not use but these ere clearlt marked and offered a number of cubicles not just one.
playa de levante benidorm,positive,"On the main promenade so handy for public transport and plenty of disabled parking spaces near it The entire front is level access and ramps take you down onto the beach. Buses are clearly marked, not all are accessible but most are. Bus stops are on a street parralell to the beach promenade."
playhouse whitley bay whitley bay,positive,There is a car park next to the venue I use my blue badge and i could to park close to the front door .
plaza de mirador de la paz puerto de la cruz,positive,The local buses stop near by but I arrived by taxi and I had level access to the square.
plaza del charco puerto de la cruz,positive,"The square is in the town centre, next to the old harbour. Three sides are padestrianised but cars can access one side of the square, and at this point taxis, which are inexpensive can drop you off and there is a taxi rank with waiting taxis for when you want to leave."
pleasance cabaret bar at pleasance courtyard edinburgh,positive,"We got the bus into Edinburgh from Glasgow, the Pleasance is a 20-25 minute walk from the bus station. I wouldn't say it was suitable for manual wheelchairs as the route has a lot of hills."
pleasance courtyard edinburgh,positive,"Easy to park with disabled badge on a Sunday morning near the venue, other times in the Festival a lot more challenging. I used the general toilet."
pleasance sport complex and gym edinburgh,positive,"The accessible toilet near the reception was well signposted, fairly spacious and more than adequate. There are 2 large open access toilets near the front of the centre that are very spacious and fully equipped"
pleasance two at pleasance courtyard edinburgh,negative,We got a taxi straight to the venue which really helped as it's up some really large hills. According to google maps it's a 10 minute walk from the Royal Mile which does look accurate if you don't have mobility impairments. 
pleasance two at pleasance courtyard edinburgh,positive,"As the toilets were in part of the courtyard and our show only lasted 1 hour, I did not use the facilities and so am unable to comment on them. "
pleasurewood hills lowestoft,negative,The toilet we used wasn’t labelled disabled toilet but just baby changing they had a step up to the toilet which isn’t helpful and the flush chain is too high up to reach the toilet is way too small to manoeuvre any disabled carriage whatsoever the red pull cord was tied up so if anyone had fallen you would not be able to get to it. There was no way of washing after you used the loo as whatever you used to enter it like your mobility scooter  it blocked the sink you would have to get out of your mobility scooter  from the right hand side and then get back into it and exit from the left hand side to use the sink and try to reach the paper hand towels.  It was just  about room for my carer but we had to change places when I needed to wash my hands. 
plug sheffield,negative,The venue does not have its own car park. Plenty parking in centre of Sheffield and minimum walking distance eg bog standard marked parking bays are located off Matilda Street
po ferries hull,positive,"Placed in a place easy to get out wheelchair and near the lift We had a powered wheelchair and my husband was able to stand; the shower room was fine.  A slight ramp into the bathroom which could be a bit disorientating when not in a wheelchair perhaps especially being on a boat.  But easy for a wheelchair user. There was a higher toilet and grab rails, emergency cord."
poachers chirk,positive,The venue has very good disability parking well marked plenty of space as I drive myself there with a large Mercedes Sprinter van. It is also on a bus route as I know other friends go there with wheelchairs on the bus.
poachers hideaway belchford,positive,"we drove ourselves to the venue, it is off the beaten track so you need a car to get there.  Parking is a little walk from the cottage over gravel.  But the Manager Ann had arranged for us to park by the door to unload and allowed us to keep the car nearby.  The manager arranged to have someone there to help us in with our bags.  The path ways are all block paved Good wide area, lots of room at the side for carer to help.  Room for me to move around with me walker."
polentoni edinburgh,negative,Decent bus services on Easter Rd
polesden lacey great bookham,negative,Come by car. That way  you will find a disabled spot much easier to park in. 
polesden lacey great bookham,positive,"You need a car as Polesdon Lacey is 5 miles from Leatherhead. There is plenty of BlueBadge parking close to the cafes and entrance to the grounds. Two accessible toilets. One at the entrance to a small cafe next to the car park and another adjacent to the larger cafe. The doors are light weigh and the facilities are generally clean. The sink and hand towels are at the correct height as it the toilet flush. You need to travel by car due to the location.  There are a good number of blue badge spaces (12) though it will get busy especially at weekends. There's a hefty charge to park and blue badges are not exempt. NT members park free. The surface is firm. Blue badge spaces are closest to the entrance but it's still some way to walk/wheel. It was a great loo.  Only negative was alarm cord tied up about three feet off the ground! There's one by the cafe, not shared with baby changing which is good. Not radar key operated. Two accessible toilets. One at the entrance to a small cafe next to the car park and another adjacent to the larger cafe. The doors are light weight and the facilities are generally kept clean. The sink and hand towels are at the correct height as the toilet flush.   "
polmont railway station polmont,negative,"Parking isn't the easiest at Polmont Train Station. While there is a small car park immediately beside the ticket office, the large car park is tucked a little further away and is only at one platform side. Parking on the main road at the other side is very difficult, particularly as this is a narrow, busy road."
ponds forge international sports centre sheffield,positive,There is a disabled carpark which is free for Blue Badge holders. There are automatic doors which lead to a lift to access the reception area.  There are many toilet facilities throughout the venue that are all fully accessible. 
pontypool active living centre pontypool,positive,"Lots of disabled parking, which to access you need to show your blue badge in order to cross the barrier.  Toilet on each floor, plus accessible showers. Wide doors and pull chords."
poole museum poole,negative,"Parking is difficult in the old part of Poole especially around the Quay, which is where the museum is. We had a long break between appointments at Poole Hospital so left the car there and used the mobility scooter (approx 1 mile) but there are closer car parks.  Good loo, well signed, but it would be difficult to access on the scooter, but ok if you can walk a bit.  Room for carer but would be cramped with a wheelchair and a carer."
poolsbrook country park caravan club site chesterfield,positive,The site is just off the M1 at junction 29A. It was easy to find and no narrow entrances or anything. All very easy. The arrivals parking area is right outside reception and is completely flat. The roads around the site are all good quality asphalt. Pitches are mostly gravel. I had a quick look but used my own facilities. They looked clean and spacious though.
pop o thym nice,negative,The toilet was not accessible.
pop o thym nice,positive,In a pedestrianised area. Buses and trams stop in the vicinity but it will involve a short walk.
pop up   bath christmas market bath,negative,We travelled by train which was very busy but takes you straight into centre. Have used park and ride before but return queues looked very long. A few on street disabled spaces in centre.  Bath has Shopmobility (not used).
pop up   bbc at george heriots school edinburgh,negative,I took the bus to George IV Bridge and propelled from there. There's currently cones in place to prevent parking but cars were allowed to drop people off and then park elsewhere. I find parking city centre difficult at the best of times but over the festival the sheer volume of people and roads which are closed makes it tricky. Public transport is easier and cheaper.  Big accès fail on the accessible toilet. A porta cabin style with a ramp running parallel to the front of the structure. Such as shame the security fence for the backstage entrance was impeding turning to get on the ramp. Not to mention the staff who had adopted the ramp as their viewpoint thus creating the effect of a queue.
pop up   bbc at george heriots school edinburgh,positive,"The accessible toilet was easy to find and there's a security guard to help get up the ramp as the door opens outwards. The red cord was tied up (it's now been freed and tagged) and the floor was wet in places which always worries me when transferring.  Transport in the area is good if going by public transport. Bus stop right outside for the accessible Lothian buses. Taxis can drop off and there plenty plying their trade in the area. Not entirely sure about parking, but there are great bus links just outside the entrance to the venue, and a pedestrian crossing straight to the pop-up. "
pop up   british summer time festival london,negative,Car parking - really not ideal - even though we had Blue Badge parking ticket. The car park itself was narrow and difficult to navigate. The car park was also quite a distance away - and there was a buggy that was available to transport people between the car park and the festival. Unfortunately my pal's powerchair was too big to use the buggy so we had to do a drop off at Hyde Park corner (rather hairy with the traffic whizzing by!). We then went through the park to the entrance which was a series of tarmac paths so easy enough to navigate even if it wasn't the closest. Public transport wise - Green Park is the nearest station and is a wheelchair accessible Underground station.
pop up   british summer time festival london,positive,"Wow what a joy!! These were absolutely ace! Firstly there was a Changing Places complete with Hoist, Medi Bed etc. There were at least 6 accessible loos - and they were all massive. There was a decent walkway up to them too."
pop up   chase park festival gateshead,negative,"We got the bus from Newcastle to Saltwell park in Gateshead, the bus journey was about 10 minutes. The bus driver was very nice and told us where we were due to get off, but there was no signs anywhere to the festival and we pretty much had to find our way via hearing the sounds coming from the grounds. In saying that Saltwell park is beautiful and was worth a dander through. Unsure about car parking.   "
pop up   chase park festival gateshead,positive,"There was plenty toilets  Clean toilets and their was even a Changing Places toilet! They were accessible portaloos but were plenty big enough.  they were sign posted. small but good .wheelchair Friendly . Access provided brilliantly around and in! There was 2 accessible toilets, positioned within easy reach. Not 5*s due to some others misuse but that happens at festivals!"
pop up   cheltenham literature festival cheltenham,positive,Plenty of on street pay and display (free with blue badge) ear the site. Check the signs though as some residents only bays do exist! 
pop up   dunfermline comic con dunfermline,negative,"Main event had adjoining car park. Marquee no parking but drop off ok.  It was situated in Fife Council manger property. Poor circulation space due to baby changing unit no furniture, shortened red cord. "
pop up   edinburgh international book festival edinburgh,negative,"Not great for cars or taxi drop off. I would tend to walk about 10-15 minutes from the nears bust stops from Saint Andrews Square, George Street or Princes Street, depending on my mood."
pop up   edinburgh international book festival edinburgh,positive,"Brilliant large, easy to use and large accessible loos. The book festival is easily accessed from Princes Street where there are a multitude of bus stops. Edinburgh Waverly is also off Princes Street and would probably take you around 20-30 mins to get to the book festival from there. Parking wise it's not so great - but there is some in Charlotte Square if you're lucky! Amazing - this is how things should be done! Located in a very busy part of the city parking is difficult. You can take your car to the entrance gate to allow disabled passengers to enter the Festival; after which you need to park. There are plenty of taxis and buses around so public transport could be a better option. Although a porta cabin style building the accessible toilet was fantastic. So much space you could have held a party! Easy to get to, on the level, wide dooorway, and grab rails."
pop up   edinburgh park   international festival stage edinburgh,positive,We got there using the tram - we got off at Edinburgh Park Central and it was just a couple of minutes away. We were asked not to be there more than 30 minutes before start time and we'd timed it well. I was surprised that the tram wasn't busier. From the tram stop it is level access to the venue and had the distinctive EIF branding marking the way.
pop up   electric fields festival thornhill,negative,"We got the bus here by 'Happy Bus' the website says its a 1.5hr journey from Edinburgh on the Friday, the 9.45 bus left at 10.15 and we arrived on site at 1pm. The bus is lead up to the box office when there's a long queue. I had asked before arriving would we get our access waistbands - and was told there would be somebody on the at the access camp. However there was some confusion and the security weren't going to let us through. However they were polite and asked at the box office and said 'thanks guys now we know.' Its about a seven minute walk from the box office to the access campsite and half way up somebody give us a lift up which was great with our heavy camping equipment etc.  On the way back we got the am bus back on the Sunday as it was so cold, and we weren't really prepared to it being 2 degrees at night. We were told that the bus will be going tom Glasgow first but we got on as it warm. We left at 1.03 and got home at 3.23am, much better than freezing in the tent with 27 layers on!"
pop up   enchanted forest pitlochry,positive,"There are 10 disabled parking spaces in the Faskally Wood area where the Enchanted Forest is hosted and once these spaces are gone they are gone. You can reserve a space when you book your ticket online and you will be told if there isn’t one available. Unfortunately, there aren’t any other disabled or non-disabled spaces nearby as Faskally Wood is 1.6 miles from Pitlochary. There is however a bus that takes guests to the Enchanted Forest from the Fishers Hotel if you have enough mobility to get on to the bus, this is available to all guests with their Enchanted Forest ticket.  Within Pitlochary there is some on street parking and council parking available in short walking distance from where the bus would pick you up from the Fishers Hotel. If you can’t get on to the bus for the Enchanted Forest and no disabled parking spaces are available then you could possibly get a taxi to Faskally Wood by parking in Pitlochary, but I’m not sure how good the taxi services are. Alternatively, you can get to Pitlochary by bus or train, check your local bus and train station for more information. There are no Changing Places toilets on site at Faskally Wood and as far as I am aware there are none in Pitlochary at all. There are portacabin disabled toilets on site, however even though I am unable to use these I tried to fit in and if you could transfer yourself there may be enough room. But if you need someone to help you then there would not be enough room.  Within the car park there is a wooden cabin with two normal sized toilets and a disabled toilet. This is bigger than the portacabin toilet, however if you are only able to transfer from one side then you may struggle if that side is your left because you are unable to get to the righthand side of the toilet."
pop up   festival no6 penrhyndeudraeth,negative,"I arrived by train with Virgin Express which was fantastic. However the communication and release of tickets with shuttle bus details at the festival end was very confusing and last minute. This late release of details extended to those using the park and ride as the festival were deciding whether it would be safe to let people park on a floodplain...From other people's experiences, I heard that this decision-making delay also led to a late release of accessibility information which accompanied tickets.  Even seasoned festival-goers couldn't understand why the condition of toilets at this festival was so bad by day one! We managed to find a permanent public toilet beside the local cafe which was usable, and there was a disabled loo there. It was being used by everyone by the looks of it though. I did not see signage for any other accessible toilets - although they will have been there."
pop up   foodies festival edinburgh,negative,"Parking was on the surrounding roads, in pay and display bays, however these were almost full and there are very few blue badge bays available.  There was then a ""walk"" through the park to get to the venue.  There is public transport to the park on Lothian buses, again there is the distance into the park across the grass to get to the venue There was an accessible porta loo, which was larger than the average porta loo.  This was at the start of the toilet area.  To get there you had to negotiate a field of mud, which I got stuck in with my walker, there was a temporary drive way for exhibitors to negotiate, which for visually impaired was a trip hazard as the edges were not clearly marked, and covered in mud.   This was right next to the urinals, which were inadequately screened, so you could see the people using the facilities. The loo itself had space for a carer as well, or a walking aid/small wheelchair, but would be tight for both. There was grap ""rail"" around the edge, but not one for the side of the toilet."
pop up   fringe central 2017 edinburgh,positive,"Faultless in that there are two accessible parking bays right outside the main entrance. Buses also pass along the adjacent road and there is ample space for taxis to drop people off at the door. If arriving as a pedestrian the building is clearly sign posted with large notices and floor graphics. The accessible toilets are great in that there is an accessible loo adjacent to the reception area. Large with grab rails, good lighting and turning space. More than that, there is a mobile Changing Places toilet station adjacent to the main entrance to the building in Windmill Street. Open from 10 am to 10 pm and staffed by volunteers. "
pop up   george square edinburgh,negative,Parking is always tricky here and this year it was worse due to the building works going on. Would be a huge help to have some more accessible parking spaces.
pop up   george square edinburgh,positive,Fine. 2 would be great!
pop up   gilded balloon edinburgh,negative,"A good bus service passes the door with the nearest stop being 2 minute walk away. Train station is a 20-30 min walk away. There is on street parking but will be quite difficult to find a space during the festival. There was a good bus service that passes frequently. The accessible toilet was adequate with enough room for a powered wheelchair but not much room for manoeuvring. Parking city centre is not easy, on street parking is available but there's a walk to the venue from where you can leave your car. Bus transport is good and stops are close to the location. "
pop up   gilded balloon edinburgh,positive,Good sized accessible loo. The only negative for me was the weight of the door.
pop up   human nature   edinburgh science edinburgh,positive,The exhibition is towards the Joppa end of the prom. There are several buses which stop on the High Street so if you're travelling here by bus it's probably easiest to get off there. If you're parking there are accessible bays next to the swimming pool. There is free parking on the streets leading up to the prom but it does get busy - especially at weekends.
pop up   london alternative market london,negative,There is a very big accessible loo however it is a basic loo.  It isnt fancy.  It has cement flooring and needs a little work.  But it works.  This is a rented venue so is not the fault of the L.A.M more of the owners of the building that could do a little better job by finishing it off.
pop up   london alternative market london,positive,There is a bus stop just outside but parking is a bit away.  However you are able to drop off at the door while someone parks car up.
pop up   maui comedy festival lahaina,negative,"There is an accessible shuttle running from the Ka'anapali hotels to the venues, but private transportation proved to be easier.  Parking spots were ample and well marked within a block of almost all venues."

pop up   paasvee festival schagen,negative,"If you go, it is important that you arrive early in the day.  Around noon, there are around fifteen to twenty thousand people in attendance and accessibility is difficult.  It is also important that you plan your transportation arrangements in advanced. Call in advance to know which ones trains accessible.  The company Accessible Travel Netherlands can assist with Travel arrangements.  Accessible parking is available outside the city center.  Because of the large crowds, bicycles and cars are not allowed in the city center on Paasvee. Accessible Taxis can be arranged in advance."
pop up   paasvee festival schagen,positive,"Accessible toilets are located at the Mikado Shopping Center, the Slothotel Igesz, and the the Bibliotheek .  The ones located at the Mikado Shopping Center is the least congested."
pop up   pleasance courtyard edinburgh,negative,There is no disabled parking at the venue. We were able however to drop off right outside the venue and were lucky to park on single yellow lines right opposite the main entrance. We were lucky but it could have been a lot more difficult. There is however a taxi rank right outside the entrance and it is near several bus routes with Lothian buses generally having good disabled access.
pop up   pleasance grand edinburgh,negative,"I didn't see any nearby parking. We got the tram to Princes Street and walked the rest of the way. Parking near the venue may be difficult but there is on street Parking. As it is on a hill, it may, if possible, be best to get dropped off outside the venue. There are some buses that pass by but did not note which numbers. Had to be dropped off on Main Street near venue and driver had to park car a couple of streets away ."
pop up   pleasance grand edinburgh,positive,"I didn't use the toilet, and didn't see one to check it out. There is a very large accessible toilet with grab rails at both sides."

The train station is approx 10-15 mins walk away. There is a bus service that passes the door although unsure as to the numbers."
pop up   pleasance two edinburgh,negative,"I walked here, but there is on-street parking nearby and bus stops on surrounding streets.  Limited and busy on street parking. There are buses nearby which could be a good option. Coming in on foot some of the approaches are very steep and require caution. May well be very difficult for manual wheelchair users; accompanied or otherwise. The accessible toilet was great once you got in the room. Therein lies the problem - getting in - a very very tight 90 degree turn in a small corridor is required. I have a small chair and struggled. So much to I decided not to revisit it again."

pop up   royal military tattoo   edinburgh castle edinburgh,positive,"As the Tattoo is at the castle the parking was non-existent. It is possible to be granted early access by car, taxi or ambulance for any performance except on Saturday.  The cobbled hill leading up to the castle was well staffed and there were also lots of military police to escort or actually push wheelchair users up the hill and into the venue. There are disabled toilets accessible at the rear of each stand.  They are very roomy and can accommodate Wheelchairs and mobility scooters with plenty of room for carers.  They were clean and well looked after when I was there."
pop up   st enoch christmas market glasgow,negative,There are accessible toilets located within the St Enochs Shopping Center.

pop up   t in the park auchterarder,negative,"We went on the third day of the festival so there was already soft ground and mud. However what wasn't there tracking down?? When we first turned into the car park we got stuck. Luckily there were some staff there to push us out (I think they had been doing that a lot by the look of them!). Then when we got to the dedicated Disabled Parking that was all boggy and muddy too. We managed to unload and get to the disabled camping area where the ""Disabled Check In"" tent was. There were the standard accessible portaloos in the disabled camping area. At the Main Stage there were two portaloos - one of which was an accessible portaloo. Again - I'm sure there used to be more!"

pop up   the royal welsh agricultural society spring festival llanelwedd,negative,Disabled parking for Spring show was on grass so could be muddy and difficult to manoeuvre  a wheelchair on.  Event Hire there hiring scooters but very expensive (£25 day). Accessible loos available but cleanliness not great.
pop up   the stand in the square edinburgh,negative,An accessible loo was located next to the large bar on the south side of the square. The decking approaching this had tapered edges allowing for easy access from all side. The loo was one of the port cabin style and had a wooden ramp leading up to the door with a ninety degree turn to go through the door. Once inside it was spacious albeit  seemingly well used - the air freshener can was there for a reason! It served its purpose as a loo ... Mixed! Parking a bit of a nightmare - but it was the festival... Lots of bus stops nearby. Plus a tram stop right next door.
pop up   the stand in the square edinburgh,positive,"Parking came as a surprise as I expected the area to be chock a block with cars, people and mayhem. As it turned out there was plenty of parking on the northern side of the square. Other members of my group were able to arrive by tram and you couldn't be any closer to the tram stop if you tried. Great Lothian bus links to St Andrew Square and both Queen Street and Princes Street either side. Various entrances into the square where taxis can drop you off. Limited parking around the edge of the square and nearby on George Street. The Square is across the road from the Edinburgh bus station if you are travelling from further afield."

Good access to basin paper, dryer, emergency cord hangs  to floor. Standard loos down stairs - approx 16 straight stairs, rails both sides"
pop up   underbellys circus hub edinburgh,negative,"This is probably the trickiest part of accessing this venue. As it's in the middle of The Meadows, naturally there is no way to drive right up to the circus tents. You'd need to park on the outskirts of the park, or get one of the frequent buses surrounding The Meadows and walk into the middle. The closest direction is probably from George Square Gardens, but there's a little (fairly steep) slope coming down from this. An alternative route is via the Quartermile which connects to Middle Meadow Walk. This is busy, but a nice wide path. Watch out for cyclists in the cycle lane! There are lots of options for reaching the Circus Hub once you're on the edge of the park."
pop up   underbellys circus hub edinburgh,positive,"There isn't much parking near the Meadows, but lots of buses stop nearby (3, 29, 47). For the 3 and the 29 there is a 9 minute walk to the venue, but the paths are flat and well-maintained.  There is only one accessible loo, but it was easy to find (near the rest of the toilets behind the bar). There is a gentle ramp up to the loo, and the loo itself is quite big (with room for a wheelchair and carer). It was well-maintained and clarn, with guide rails. "
pop up pleasance dome edinburgh,negative,"Parking is very challenging, particularly in festival time. Nearest I think is George Square if you're lucky enough to find a space, or other option is Buccleuch street. Parking is a bit of a nightmare (again - it's the festival) but you can get dropped off nearby and there are also bus stops nearby."

Accessible toilet easy to find and signed well, lots of rails to hand. It has baby change too.

Low light toilet. 3 accessible blue badge spaces with side and rear hash lines for safe entry/exit. Hard surface level access. Some standard spaces are on a gentle slope.  Being familiar with toilet standards, the space is very good and just needs an ostomy shelf. Unfortunately no hoist or adult changing bench. Baby changing is in this space but not intrusive (it's bigger than the UK standard. Clean and low level light."

There are two accessible loos that I have visited. One in the reception area and a second adjacent to the Board Room. Both are fairly spacious, well  appointed and spotlessly clean."
port selma lodges benderloch,positive,"You park at the back of the lodge and there is ramped access to the building. Both lodges comprise a double bedroom with en suite wetroom bathroom with grabrails and a moveable showerseat, plus a twin room and a bathroom with shower over the bath. the only improvement I would make would be a higher level loo, but as there are grabrails, it was not a big problem.  Parking at door. The lodges both have two bedrooms/bathrooms. The double room has en suite wet room with underfloor heating, power shower with shower stool, rails etc.  Rails at toilet and whb. Parking was behind the lodge. With enough space for the electric wheelchair to exit from the car safely The wet room in the double bedroom was very good.  There was enough room for the camode/shower chair to go over the wc with plenty of room for the pa to work   "
port solent portsmouth,negative,The public disabled loo is very cold and draghty with many fixtures and fittings broken. Pull cord often tied in knots around pipework. Spacious but check bolts in wall prior to load bearing the fold down grab rail.   The berth holder disabled toilet is all to often used by non disabled users because it is the largest shower area. The sign saying disabled only is too small. The pull cord is often tied to pipework or railings. It is large but sadly this is the only one of its kind in the east block. There is another in the west block. As yet unreviewed. 
port solent portsmouth,positive,There are a significant number of disabled parking spaces behind most buildings at Port Solent. The problem is then relying on the 2 lifts to be in working order for you to change levels in order to access the main boardwalk area.  The closest parking spaces to the two lifts are located firstly outside the Odeon Cinema and secondly behind Casa Brazil and David Lloyd Gym.

portobello promenade edinburgh,negative,"I came by bus and then rolled down Kings Road. I am not sure about parking. The accessible toilet is, on paper, accessible. It is behind the main toilet hut (behind Oscar’s stall). There is a ramp up to the door, which opens with a RADAR key, and pushes inward. The toilet has hand rails and space for a wheelchair to move around (just). Inside you have to go round a bend and then you’re in the main toilet area. The lighting is awful so I used my mobile phone flash to help me see. The red cord is barely a cord, it reaches six inches from the ceiling never mind from the floor. There is a tiny sink which isn’t very accessible. The area isn’t very clean either which isn’t a great feeling to be around in COVID times."
portobello promenade edinburgh,positive,"Parking is available at points along the promenade in the adjacent side streets. There is also parking at the west end. Buses pass along Portobello's main street some 500 metres from the Prom. Toilets are available at the east end of the promenade where there's an accessible loo. A RADAR key is required for access. This loo is OK but not very spacious, even a bit tight, if you happen to be a powerchair user. Midway along the prom there is one of those automated loos. A RADAR key gives free access."
portsmouth historic dockyard portsmouth,positive,"The one thing I give them full marks for, toilets were fab, including a Changing Places next to the Mary Rose, which even had a toilet sling on the hoist. "
potter about burntisland,positive,"It's situated on the high street, which has a couple of disabled parking bays, one of which is very close to the front door. It can get quite busy at times, so parking close can occasionally be difficult. There is a large car park with more disabled bays a short walk from the cafe, but it's down a hill that some users may find challenging. Clean and spacious with a grab rail on one side. The door can be a little stiff as it catches on the floor, but it's not ridiculous and would only cause problems for those with limited mobility. The staff are very friendly though, so they'd be more than happy to help if you found it difficult."
potteric carr doncaster,positive,Blue badge parking 50 yards from visitor centre. Clean and roomy disabled loo although the door opens awkwardly towards you as you approach. We parked in a blue badge space right outside the visitors centre but were also offered the option to enter the reserve and drive to the cafe and park outside if that was more convienient for us. We used two; one in the visitor centre and one in the cafe.  Both seemed ok.  The one in the visitors centre also has a shower.
potterrow edinburgh,positive,"There is a public disabled bay located along Crichton Street, which is very close to the venue There is an accessible toilet located on the ground floor. The accessible toilet contains left hand lateral transfer space.  There is adequate manoeuvring space, There is an emergency pull chord alarm. The door slides open to the left. The width of the accessible toilet door is suitable for wheelchair users. There are suitable dropdown and support rails for transfer. The tap type is a lever mixer. The contrast between the grab rails and walls is not good. The contrast between the walls and floor is good. The lighting level in the cubicle is not great"

poundstretcher edinburgh,negative,Parking available in  nearby centre car park. Buses nearby.
powis castle and garden welshpool,negative,Disabled parking is directly down the hill. I would advice to use a powerchair or a carer who pushes your wheelchair. The disabled toilet is easy to find. When you are in a manual wheelchair you might ask someone to push you. 
prague zoo prague,positive,"The Zoo has space to accommodate around 850 cars and individuals with a disability ID card can park for free all day. The cost is normally CZK 200 which is the equivalent of £7 for all day. The buses are all wheelchair friendly as they have a manual fold out ramp at the centre door. The 112 bus goes straight to the zoo which leaves Nádraží Holešovice metro station, 2/3 of the metro stations are wheelchair accessible including this one. However, most metro stations have 2 or 3 entrances and not every entrance has a lift down to the metros.  There were disabled toilets in most of the toilet blocks and the toilet blocks were located in many places around the zoo. The toilets were very easy to find as they were always signposted. The toilets were clean, tidy and spacious. "

On the cathedral side of Temple Row West, right outside the entrance, there is specific disabled parking with room for about eight cars.  On Waterloo Street there is regular on-street metered parking with a limit of four hours but, of course, as a blue badge holder you can park there without limit.

premier inn bournemouth east cliff hotel bournemouth,negative,"I cannot comment on the disabled parking as we arrived by train; it is only a leisurely ten minute walk from the railway station, with not many obstacles for a wheelchair user apart from one or two footpaths that didn't have conveniently placed drop kerbs.    The nearest road, fifty feet away is served by a number of wheelchair accessible buses.     The hotel has a secure underground car park, which is short walk to the rear of the building (no direct access from the hotel, as far as I could make out) and is shared with the building's other occupants.  We didn't use it so I don't know if they charged for blue badge holders. "

Although this hotel does not have parking, there are on-street disabled bays nearby; however, they all have three hour limits. There are though regular on-street parking bays nearby, on which blue badge holders can park without limit; the nearest are about 60 metres away on Lower Maudlin Street, just outside the eye hospital.

However, once there the car park is perfectly adequate with several disabled spaces. Dotted regularly around the place and a decent size too, as with the ensuite facilities  in the rooms."
premier inn catterick garrison hotel catterick garrison,positive,We drove. Free parking and good amount of disabled spaces available 
premier inn cleethorpes hotel cleethorpes,positive,"A number (?) of disabled parking bays and a ramp to the reception automatic door. The bathroom in the accessible room was ideal. There was a low-sided bath. But I did need help with the toilet rail - it was a little too heavy to move into 'down' position, but no problem when I asked receptionist (Keeley). Reception was very close-by."
premier inn county hall london,positive,"There are two accessible tube stations near this hotel, there is on street parking, and a taxi can pull up right at the front door. The bathroom in the room is large, laid out with thought, and as a wet room so everyone can stay clean. Excellent for public transport as between Waterloo and Westminster Bridge.  We had the room with the accessible wet room with a roll in shower. Excellent toilet and shower with plenty of room. "
premier inn dover central eastern ferry terminal dover,positive,easy right outside reception
premier inn dublin airport swords,positive,"We didn't try the public loo, the loo and bathroom in the bedroom were absolutely fine."
premier inn dundee centre dundee,positive,"Positioned on the waterfront, Premier Inn Dundee Centre is less than a minutes walk from Dundee train station and only half a mile from the city centre. A 24-hour reception and free parking are also featured. You shouldn't have a problem if you are looking for a disabled car parking space. There was an accessible toilet in our room witch was perfect with a walk in shower."
premier inn dundee north dundee,negative,"Toilet was accessible, large with grab rails but only a low level bath, no wet room "
premier inn edinburgh airport newbridge edinburgh,positive,"Free Parking onsite. There are many disabled parking spaces and it is very easy to park and a short distance to walk to your hotel. If you book an wheelchair accessible room then you should have a double bed and an nice and spacious, fully accessible toilet with hand rails and a walk in shower which is perfect for a wheelchair user. "
premier inn edinburgh central edinburgh,negative,"There are accessible toilets by the bar as well as standard toilet facilities. Lauriston Place is a busy area of the city with a hospital, schools and other hotels. Parking is at a premium and there’s limited on street parking for Blue Badge holders. There are some nearby car parks for long stay visit.  For public transport you have the option of using taxis (black cabs) which are accessible or the local bus services. Several Lothian bus routes pass by the front door and you can get a day ticket that covers both the buses and the trams. All Lothian buses and the trams are wheelchair accessible. There are toilets next to the bar and adjacent to the restaurant area. These include and accessible toilet. Some upgrading work was being undertaken during my visit so I was unable to see them myself."
premier inn edinburgh central edinburgh,positive,"For me, public transport was important as I am visually impaired and do not drive. The hotel is handy for several bus services that pass along the road outside. It’s also easy for taxis to drop off and pick up."
premier inn edinburgh city centre edinburgh,positive,Toilet accessible with plenty of room for 2 people & a wheelchair also plenty of grab rails.
premier inn edinburgh park edinburgh,positive,"I travelled on public transport. The hotel is next to Edinburgh Park train station. Immediately behind the station is Edinburgh Park tram stop and next to that a bus stop going into the city centre.  The entire area is step free and there are 2 lifts to cross over the railway line. I felt the area was very safe, even at night, as I got off the train or tram and I was in the hotel 2 minutes later and there were always other people about, but it wasn't ever crowded.  There are direct trains to Haymarket and Edinburgh Waverley, the main train station,which only takes about 10 minutes. The tram make more stops and also goes to the Airport. There are a few buses that serve the area too.  The location is excellent. I would very happily stay here again.  I had an accessible toilet in my room with grab rails and emergency cord. The communal accessible toilet does not require a radar key and also had grab rails and an emergency cord. Both toilets were very clean. "
premier inn elgin elgin,positive,Large car park adjacent to hotel with disabled spaces by the front door.
premier inn glasgow airport paisley,positive,"I didn’t use the public toilet only the one within the bedroom. This was very accessible with lots of handle bars, transfer space and a good height. It was very clean. "
premier inn glasgow motherwell hotel motherwell,positive,Plenty of disabled parking bays near the entrance.
premier inn glastonbury hotel glastonbury,positive,"We drove down and there is disabled parking available onsite but if it's very busy, you might struggle to get a space, however, there are non-disabled spaces in the overspill car-park across the road.  There are also buses from Bristol to Glastonbury which take about an hour and a half and there is a bus-stop located outside the Town Hall; the bus stops outside the hotel and takes about ten minutes. "
premier inn halifax town centre halifax,negative,Available but not directly outside or anywhere near enough the entrance! It's located in a near by Private multi-storey parking and by an extra charge of £7 /24h
premier inn halifax town centre halifax,positive,Large with a wet room so can easy fit a shower chair - just perfect!
premier inn harrogate south harrogate,positive,The are disabled  parking spaces at the rear of the hotel and the  Hornbeam Park Train station is at the rear of the hotel car park.  The bedroom accessible loo was easily accessed by wheelchair.  There  was only a bath and that looked very narrow. No shower. Quite easy to manoeuvre wheelchair . There were grab rails and it was clean. There was also room for a carer.
premier inn hartlepool marina hartlepool,positive,"We drove to Hartlepool and back from Perth using the M90, A720, and A1 to reach Hartlepool in around 5 hours easy driving including stops. The vast majority of car parks in the entire area are either free or very cheap for blue badge holders.    Didn't use the buses at all but they were operating to all places far and wide.  As a mobility scooter user I don't want the hassle of using buses. There is a mainline station on the Sunderland-London line with regular services. As this is a general review of the area visited there were many accessible toilets, well signposted, clean and tidy, big enough to take a scooter straight in. I did not come across any changing places toilets at all."
premier inn high fishergate doncaster,positive,"I just used the wet room in my room. It was huge with lots of handles and rails, transfer space and 2 red cords hanging to the floor. "
premier inn holborn london,negative,Train to London Victoria and a Cab to Holborn
premier inn holborn london,positive,"very good, but no changing bench or hoist"
premier inn lancaster lancaster,negative,I could get into the loo easily  enough
premier inn lancaster lancaster,positive,There is a car park. But not many disabled spaces.
premier inn leeds arena leeds,negative,Travelling by train we walked across town from the station which was around twenty minutes. Might have been quicker but we didn't really know where we were going. Thanks to the sat nav skills of my colleague's Apple Watch we made it fairly pain free. It didn't look as though there was much parking around but we didn't explore too far looking for that.
premier inn leeds arena leeds,positive,The accessible bathroom in my room was excellent. There was an accessible loo in the public area but I didn't use it.
premier inn leeds city centre leeds,positive,"We came by car. Two disabled parking spaces to rear of hotel. Cut price rates for adjacent car park.  The room has a large wet room with shower, seats and all necessary rails. See photos. "
premier inn lincoln canwick hotel canwick,positive,"We always found a blue badge space free by the entrance.  Car park shared with the Table Table pub. See photo. Good grip floor, full range of support rails (however note there is a height difference between the left and right horizontal bars of about an inch). Sink is higher than some accessible rooms - we take a portable as I lean into the sink to hair wash). Shower area is ruined somewhat by too many support rails and no shelf for soap etc. See photo. Noisy extraction fan. Shiny chrome fittings cause glare."
premier inn liverpool north bootle,negative,"The wet room was also spacious, with perfectly adequate grab rails, although the pull down ones seemed to shake a bit.  The pull down seat at the shower seemed to be of canvas but worked fine, even with the wobbly pull down rail."
premier inn liverpool north bootle,positive,"There was good disabled parking at the hotel, with a number of bays.  Unfortunately it was a wee bit of a walk (I was using a walker on this occasion) but the automatic doors made entry easy."
premier inn london archway london,positive,Very good if you drive. Blue badge holders can park at the door. Archway tube station is very close but it has limited access. There are buses that serve the area but I have used them. Very good.
premier inn london city old street london,positive,The accessible bathroom was really good. Plenty of space to move around with my powerchair. Good fittings and everything with easy reach.
premier inn london docklands excel hotel london,positive,"There were over 10 disabled parking bays. These are free for residents and very close to the entrance. (See photos) Great spacious accessible toilets in room and next to the bar/restaurant area. If you arrive by car you can park in the Blue Badge bays right by the front door (50m). The nearest DLR station  is Prince Regent and its a short walk of around 500m / 15 minutes. The accessible bathroom was fine with enough room to manoeuvre. The loo by the bar and restaurant was large, easy to access and clean."
premier inn london edmonton hotel london,positive,"Huge wetroom in the room and decent toilet downstairs. The car park has plenty of spaces, including ten disabled bays; there is a decent sized overflow car park too.  The car park is secured overnight by a barrier, with access granted by security within the hotel.    I was disappointed to find that all ten disabled parking bays were occupied but only four vehicles, including ours were displaying blue badges. Some of the contractors parked in them had obviously had hard days and couldn’t be bothered to walk the additional fifty yards to and from the overflow car park!  What really annoyed me though was the able bodied female member of restaurant staff who parked her little green Vauxhall car in a disabled bay, did not display a blue badge and then skipped into work; yet there were several regular bays just twenty feet away.  Observing her dashing around the restaurant that evening she certainly didn’t look like someone with a hidden disability, more like someone that didn’t want to park her precious car close to others, preferring instead to prevent genuine disabled users from parking – see photo.  The bathroom was a good size, with a sliding door; there was plenty of space in it for my wife to manoeuvre her wheelchair.   access to it was easy for my wife due to the large amount of floor space just outside it.  Strong shower seat and plenty of grab bars. As is common with most other Premier Inn rooms we have stayed in, the thermostatic shower was easy to control and the water pressure was very good; it remained at a constant temperature whilst showering.   We didn't use the toilet in the reception / restaurant area. "
premier inn london heathrow airport terminal 5 longford,positive,There was a wet room with sliding door in our room.  There was a disabled loo in the ground floor area by the lifts.  Sadly not signposted so I only found it by chance.
premier inn london st pancras hotel london,positive,"No parking close but close to 3 mainline stations. Tube lines and bus stops close by.  Toilet in wet room had space, all required rails and a full length red cord. "
premier inn london stratford london,positive,"Carpark A is closest to the hotel, there as blue badge parking places on most floors and even if you cannot use a blue badge, the non bb parking spaces are very close. Parking is not a problem. Public transport is within a few yards of the hotel and being Olympic Park developed, is disability friendly. Accessible loos in reception and in our room, properly designed and easy to use. Transport is great if you are arriving from Stratford International on The High Speed One Service or the DLR (Docklands Light Railway). Access by car may be more complicated and more so if you need close proximity access. Stratford Regional Station at the other end of the shopping centre has bus, underground and tube links - the Jubilee line is accessible into town. The wet room in my room was great with plenty of space and everything I needed. There was an accessible loo by the bar and restaurant which was fine."
premier inn lowestoft lowestoft,positive,Large car-park with six disabled parking spaces near the entrance.   Bus stop near by front of building but don't know how regular buses are. Just used toilet in my room (with grab rails and plenty of room) and didn't notice any others. 
premier inn m8 junction 3 hotel livingston,positive,"Dedicated disabled parking spaces near the entrance. Bus stop right at the door, literally 2 minutes off the M8 motorway Accessible bathroom in the room,plenty of room for wheelchair and walking frame. However there was a bath , which although it had rails around it, was inaccessible to me several disabled parking bays right at the door."
premier inn manchester airport runger lane south altrincham,positive,"There is chargeable parking at this hotel with plenty of disabled bays, but when we checked in that was waived; my wife is a blue badge holder. Take note IHG! The drive to Terminal 1 only took less than five minutes.  The accessible bathroom was a good size and, despite it having a hinged door rather than a sliding one, access to it was easy for my wife due to the large amount of floor space just outside it, and the door opening to almost 180 degrees.  There were plenty of grab bars. The bathroom had a shower type we had not seen in a Premier Inn bathroom before; rather than it being of the traditional wet-room style, there was a sunken shower tray with a grilled covering and low-level hinged screen doors enclosing it (see photos). The most obvious benefit being that water did not go all over the bathroom. As is common with most other Premier Inn rooms we have stayed in, the thermostatic shower was easy to control, the temperature was constant, and the water pressure was very good.   We didn’t’ use the accessible toilets in the public areas. "
premier inn newbury town centre south newbury,negative,We didn’t use any public toilets so I cannot comment on them.
premier inn newbury town centre south newbury,positive,"This hotel has free parking with six disabled bays; I’m not sure if that matches the number of accessible rooms, but they were all taken by about 6pm.   Please note that the car park is controlled by an outside operator, so, to avoid a charge, you need to input you registration number into the tablet situated in reception. "
premier inn newcastle city centre the gate newcastle upon tyne,negative,There is no parking attached to the hotel but a Pay & Display multi story car park is at the rear of the hotel. We travelled to Newcastle by train and walked & rolled for 10 - 15 minutes to the hotel. Internally a permanent ramp takes wheelchair users to reception with 2 lifts then to the bedrooms. I believe that no bedrooms at all are on the same level as reception.
premier inn newcastle city centre the gate newcastle upon tyne,positive,As a guest in any hotel I only use the toilet in the bedroom. The toilet and shower were fine for me with a permanent shower seat available. 
premier inn newton abbot kingsteignton,negative,We had a non accessible toilet and it was very hard to use
premier inn newton abbot kingsteignton,positive,"Bays both undercover and in the open , next to the door. Lift and automatic doors nearby. A matter of personal taste but good size for manual transfers with good transfer space. Very grippy floor and all the usual handrails.  Toilet pan slightly unusual back which may not accommodate a portable bidet like I use.  Hotel carpark"
premier inn oxford business park oxford,positive,Disabled  parking at entrance to hotel.  Easy driving access at edge of City. Large accessible bathroom with grab rails.  Not all accessible rooms have roll in showers so request on booking.
premier inn phoenix park paisley,positive,"The disabled parking is very good, as they have 6 spaces The toilets are only accessible from one side but have a reasonable amount of transfer space."
premier inn ringwood hotel ringwood,negative,"Did not see any signage for an accessible wc in public area ie reception, restaurant."
premier inn southampton west hotel southampton,negative,"No wet room, there was a bath with a shower in it with handrails. Door slid open and closed which was a good point. In my opinion it was not an accessible bathroom."
premier inn southampton west hotel southampton,positive,Disabled parking at front door
premier inn sunderland city centre sunderland,positive,there is a disabled car parking next to the hotel. If you are ablebodied  there is no carparking and you have to use public carparking. This means there is the temptation to use the disabled spaces. When I arrived on the first night there wasn't any disabled spaces left and the car park was full of illegal cars. When I complained the next morning all the illegal cars had gone!
premier inn taunton ruishton taunton,positive,"This hotel does has free parking with four disabled bays, two near to our block and two outside reception. There is a further regular bay adjacent to each of those that could accommodate a wheelchair user, depending on whether you drive in or reverse in. "
premier inn telford international centre telford,negative,"Because of the hotels location there is no disabled parking or drop off at the hotel. The road behind the hotel is where we used to set-down to unload/load but for me in a power chair this was not a problem. For a person like me at 6'2"" the bars in the room were to low. Instead of two drop down bars one was a wall fixed bar which gives you no room to put weight through the bar to stand up. On the wall was the loo paper in the space where your elbow would go."
premier inn torquay seafront torquay,positive,"The hotel is on Torquay's sea front. It's about a 8-10 minute, level walk to the railway station. There are also several buses that serve the sea front and the bus stops in both directions are a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. Please note that the buses I used, had one front door which also has a ramp and there were separate wheelchair and buggy  spaces.   The car parking area in front of the hotel starts on the flat and slopes upwards with a notable gradient. I noted that there is a charge for guests using it. There are disabled bays by the entrance. I didn't have a car so please check with the hotel directly if you require more information about their car park. Please note if you are using a taxi it will stop outside the entrance where there is a ramp to exit the building and the car park is level.  In my accessible room their was an accessible toilet with grab rails and emergency cord.  In the reception area by the Beefeater restaurant and bar is an accessible toilet. There is a sign on it saying ""Polite Notice. Please see a member of Beefeater staff  or reception for the key"". See photo. On the first time I went to use it the toilet was locked. Given the notice I went to reception to get the key. It turns out that the accessible toilet does not require a key. So if it is locked it's in use. The staff have put the notice up to try to deter people who are just popping in to use the facilities.  The toilet was clean, large but not spacious. There were grab rails and an emergency cord which reached to the floor."
premier inn waterloo london,positive,"Fantastic location just 5 mins from Waterloo Station which we reached via Jubilee Line. Great - and there's also an accessible loo conveniently located both in reception and in the restaurant / bar area.  No parking for cars but a great location for public transport. London buses stop in the street outside. Waterloo station is a short distance from the hotel; as is Waterloo Underground station. Great to see a hotel that has planned for accessibility and the provision of suitable toilets. There was a really good wet room in the bedroom. An accessible toilet was located in the foyer area and another adjacent to the bar and restaurant. All of these were spotlessly clean, spacious and easy to use. The public accessible loo at reception was a decent size.  The one in my room was a good size with no issues encountered."
premiere cinemas cardiff,positive,"There are loads of disabled parking spaces available on Churchill Way, about a minutes walk from cinema. Churchill way is literally yards away with free parking for blue badges, or the cinema is within the capital centre which has parking too. Clean and plenty of space, accessible loos need a radar key."
preston park museum grounds preston,positive,"Parking is free and is situated within the grounds. There are designated parking bays and a large overflow car park, part of which is on grass. Designated disabled parking can be found within the main  car park. If travelling by train, Eaglescliffe railway station is a 10/15-minute walk away from the hall. There is also a bus route which stops next the  hall.  The accessible toilet in the main building is situated next to the stairs leading to the first floor. The toilet in the grounds can be found next to 'cafe tees'.  Good size car park, with decent size spaces for all.  Didn't seem to be very many disabled spaces but that was OK as we just parked in a normal space which was easily manageable due to the size of them.  Close to the park and a very short stroll to the museum which is in the park grounds along a short path.  "
preston preston,negative,"Exterior parking to the Railway station is limited and expensive. However, as the Railway Station is located by the town centre, there are other options of parking nearby such as a multi-story. Toilets were acceptable - which is better than most public facilities. They were modern"
preston preston,positive,Parking is available at the station and buses stop outside.
prestonfield house edinburgh,negative,"The accessible loo is beside the back door, so back down in the lift. It took a few goes to get in to the loo as it's really tight. Eventually I worked out that in order to get in and close the door I had to reverse in. Really not sure how someone in a wheelchair would manage. There's a baby changing table hinged to the wall too, and again I can't imagine how someone could get in while holding a baby and lower the changing table and close the door... maybe it's designed for jugglers?! All of this would be really easily fixed by making the door open outwards instead of inwards. All spotless and with lovely toiletries, as you might expect. I was a bit embarrassed to have to leave my paper towels on the sink, as the bin was a tiny pedal bin and I couldn't stand on one leg to open it."
prestonfield house edinburgh,positive,"Parking was a little haphazard as it was a very large event, however the parking attendants allowed us to park right next to the front door in a non marked area. Was surprised how good it was for it's location.  The disabled loo I used was in the ladies toilets.  A little disappointing as you had to negotiate a swing door to get in then the normal loo door.  Not sure you could fit a wheelchair in it.  Perfect for me as it had a really high toilet (I almost needed a step!). Plenty of parking in the grounds outside the building. Taxi can drop off at the front or back entrance to the building. A member of staff was stationed at the front door to direct visitors to wherever they needed to be."
pret a manger cardiff,negative,First you have to go through one door to get into a space which includes the accessible loo and the cleaner's cupboard.  You will probably need to ask someone to open the door for you. If you are in a wheelchair you should be fine.  I drove forward on my scooter to get inside the cubicle but had awful problems reversing out.  Next time I'll know better. It was big enough for a carer and it was clean.
pret a manger cardiff,positive,The coffee shop is on the ground floor and there is parking above the building.
pret a manger edinburgh,positive,Good for buses or the tram. Roomy but tricky to enter due to high chairs.
pret a manger london,negative,"There is an accessible toilet, modern and well-appointed. But as so often, Prêt have let us down again - the red emergency cord had been tied up in a tight and complex knot around a grab-rail - see my picture below. The red cord should hang freely all the way to the floor, so that it can be used in an emergency to summon help if someone falls over. Very annoying and disappointing to see it tied up here, as in so many other places. If you're arriving at Victoria by train, you're likely to get ramp assistance (though it's very hit-and-miss at this station). Many buses will drop you off here. The District and Circle lines are completely inaccessible, the Victoria Line may become step-free later in 2017.  Several bus routes will drop you off nearby in Tottenham Court Road. There are no step-free stations nearby. If you are patient, you can wait until c. 2017 when Tottenham Court Road Station should become fully step-free. I don't know about parking. The nearest step-free station is King's Cross, which is quite a long way off. There are buses going up and down Euston Road, north of this branch of Prêt, but they too are a long way off. A few buses serve nearby Russell Square. The 'ordinary' toilets were out of order. The accessible toilet has a huge rubbish bin in the wheelchair transfer area. This means that it is not possible to park in that area to transfer sideways to the toilet. How thoughtless and silly! The wheelchair transfer area must always be kept clear. The red emergency cord had been tucked away behind a grabrail and one of its plastic triangles had been used to clip it firmly around the grabrail. Astonishing ignorance! See my photo below. A decent facility with grab rails but it is used as a storage cupboard. Luckily the staff were on hand and cleared the space very quickly. The nearest tube station is Sloane Square, which is not step-free, but does have escalators from the westbound (but NOT the eastbound) platform to street level, so if you can get out of your wheelchair and take it up an escalator, this station may be an option. Loads of buses go along the King's Road. I wouldn't attempt to park nearby. There is an excellent accessible toilet spoilt by two features. (1) the door into the toilet lobby is terribly heavy and stiff, not at all wheelchair-user-friendly - one star lost for this (2) the red emergency cord had been tied to the handrail in a complex knot, and was consequently useless to anyone who might need it in an emergency.  See my photo below. Two stars lost for this piece of crass thoughtlessness. We were at a theatre in the area and popped in for a sandwich. The dropped kerbs nearby seemed to have no rhyme or reason to them so ended up wheeling down the middle of the road (not a busy one so pretty traffic free luckily). Having said that it's in the middle theatre land so access to different modes of public transport nearby. Numerous buses serve the area around (but not inside) Soho, the nearest step-free station is Green Park (about a mile away), with Tottenham Court Road station becoming step-free sometime around 2016. The nearest step-free station is Green Park which is more than half a mile away. A few bus routes will drop you off in Shaftesbury Avenue, which is a short distance away. There is a multi-storey car park in nearby Brewer St. London Bridge Station is nearby and has step-free access to both Northern and Jubilee Lines, but check before you travel because the lifts are damned unreliable and often out of service for months at a time. Several bus routes pass up and down nearby Borough High St. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area. The accessible toilet was generally good but it had an extravagance of bins - *three* of them, crowding out the space where a wheelchair user needs to park in order to achieve a smooth sideways transfer to the toilet. Very thoughtless to put these enormous bins in such a silly place. See my picture below. Victoria Station is very nearby. If you're arriving at Victoria by train, you're likely to get ramp assistance (though it's very hit-and-miss at this station). Many buses will drop you off here. The tube is completely un-accessible - a disgrace for such a major London transport hub. There is an accessible toilet. At first I was unable to access it at all because the staff had piled a huge number of cardboard packing boxes and a metal-framed object in the short corridor leading to the toilet. They removed these objects, which took some time, before I was able to gain access to the toilet.   I was also dismayed to find that the lighting in the toilet was broken. So the staff had resorting to opening the door to the adjacent store room to light the toilet. This is hardly ideal. Why not just fix the lighting? Great tube links (just beside London Bridge tube station on the Jubilee line). Very limited parking options. This branch has a good accessible toilet. A large bin was in the wheelchair transfer area, betraying a bad failure by the staff to understand the correct layout of an accessible toilet. Two stars lost for that.   Can't comment on parking. Bank nearest accessible station (DLR only) "
pret a manger london,positive,"I don't know about parking, but this branch is not far from Waterloo Station and Southwark Station, both of which are step-free on the Jubilee Line. Beware at Waterloo: the Jubilee Line lift is flakey, and is often out of service. Check before you travel! Loads of buses pass nearby, and Wimbledon station is yards away, with completely step-free Tramlink services and ramp assistance available to suburban trains. I don't know about parking. Shoreditch High St Overground station is very nearby and is completely step-free :-) and several bus routes run past this branch of Prêt. Good size and clean. See pic. Victoria Station is a few blocks away to the west, all of it is fully step-free, though getting ramp assistance from the staff, especially on arrival there, is extremely hit-and-miss, and if you want to travel by tube, check beforehand whether the lifts are working, as they are notoriously unreliable, despite being brand new at the time of writing.   Westminster station, to the east, is fully step free for all lines serving it.   Several bus routes will drop you off very near this branch of Prêt. Well equipped loo, has a baby change station too. Might be a squeeze for a carer.  Green Park station is a few yards away an - on a good day - is fully step-free, but check before you travel, because the lifts are this station are notoriously unreliable. Zillions of buses go along Piccadilly. I don't know about parking in this area. Tower Hill Station is nearby and is fully step free from street to train.   The no. 15 bus passes nearby but beware! because this is one of the very few routes in London still running just a few of the old-style totally non-accessible Routemaster buses, for heritage reasons. You may need to wait a while before the next accessible bus comes along.   I don't know about parking in this area."
pret a manger reading,negative,"Not Applicable To get to the loo you need a pin [1278]. This open an only slightly larger than normal door. This is a quite heavy pull door with only a small handle to grip.  Inside there are two toilets. One a standard gender neutral bathroom, the other the accessible one. This is also a baby changing station  The loo had one grab handle, was clean and had a large amount of space to manoeuvre.  The red chord was when I entered wrapped around the grab handle. It was also tied so it didn’t reach the floor. During my visit I fixed this and left a Red Chord sign on it. There is also a small sticker explaining that it needs to not be tied up.   There was a sanitary waste and a nappy bin. No medical waste bin. "
pret a manger richmond,negative,"The accessible toilet is at the back. It would be fine but for several really bad problems. (1) The red emergency cord is much too short, useless to anyone who falls to the floor. (2) Big bins block the wheelchair transfer area. (3) The doorknob for releasing the door to get out of the toilet cubicle is much too high on the door for many wheelchair users - a particularly stupid piece of design. For all three problems, see my attached pictures."
pret a manger richmond,positive,Richmond Station is nearby and staff are always on hand to provide ramp and other assistance. Many bus routes serve Richmond.
pret a manger saint albans,negative,"There is a disabled toilet located to the back of the cafe. However the space where the toilets are located slightly cramped as there is only one other toilet,  however it is manageable to get to and from if need be. "
pretzel pizza creations 2 frederick,negative,"Two large single unisex rooms, handrails around toilet, lever-operated faucets, no changing table or diapering station"
prezzo aberdeen,positive,Union Square has a multi storey & outside car park with disabled parking baysr.

prezzo glasgow,negative,Usual city parking. 
prezzo glasgow,positive,"All required rails, nice clean toilet but the red cord was like knitting. I brought it to the attention of the manager and left a Euan’s Red Cord Card. "
prezzo letchworth garden city,negative,Bit small - didn't notice grab rails.
prezzo letchworth garden city,positive,Large car park nearby - about 10 disabled spaces. Train station and numerous bus stops nearby.
prezzo london,negative,Not near accessible tube. We walked/wheeled from Waterloo - about fifteen minutes.
prezzo london,positive,Great loo.  BUT it was used by everyone else and a table was of course right outside it meaning they had to move chairs so my wheelchair could get through!
prezzo wokingham,negative,"There is no on-site parking, although there are car parks a short walk away. It is also possible to park on yellow lines for Blue Badge holders. Unfortunately the parking immediately outside the restaurant is a taxi rank. As this is a busy area parking may prove a bit difficult."
prezzo wokingham,positive,"There is a good accessible toilet, which is clearly signed."
prezzo york,negative,No parking associated with the restaurant. We walked and rolled from our hotel into the city centre.  Disabled parking is opposite the restaurant.
prezzo york,positive,"The  disabled toilet meant negotiating through the  tables but there was enough room to get through. A member of staff guided me there, which I appreciated,  but wasn't necessary. "
pride n joy bridlington,positive,At the front of the building was a parking place for a car. It was about a 10 minute walk/ wheelchair ride to the train station. There was a bus stop at the end of the street. The wetroom is very well laid out and designed. There is lots of space to move around and actually has a sliding door to help with gaining access. The only let down was no left hand grap rail for toilet or toilet frame which meant a few times when trying to sit down the toilet was missed. Arrived by train..took us around 15 to 20 minutes walk taking our time myself in my powerchair and partner walking. Wetroom fully accessible  Whole flat spotless.
pride veterinary centre derby,positive,"Bus stop a short walk away from entrance to main reception (I got the bus from Derby Bus Station, the bus stop is on other side of road otherwise. There are traffic lights to assist with crossing but this does make the walk further). There are two disabled bays next to main entrance."
primark cheltenham,negative,No disabled parking however you could get a bus into town and walk.
primark glasgow,positive,"We drove. Plenty of designated accessible parking throughout Braehead, large car park next to Primark No signage, but if you ask staff they’ll advise you where they are( at the back of the store) Clean and tidy, plenty of grabrails, room to manoeuvre and for a carer. "
prime suite hotel daet daet,negative,"Hotel is on the main street, very narrow frontage. Parking for 3 cars only, but a security guard 24 hours, and if you advise him, he will book your space in the front."
prime suite hotel daet daet,positive,"Toilet was in same room with the shower, but the shower head was fixed so direction of hot water was limited but possible. The real problem was the room given to sit on the toilet, you were 10 inches facing the wall, the shower is on the right, so room was very limited."
primrose vale farm shop cheltenham,negative,"A dirt covered parking area, and we did not see disabled bays, but all close enough to main shop entrance anyway We did not find any disabled toilets, but not really looking for them."
prince edward theatre london,negative,"This is in the Theatre Land of central London, so driving and parking could be difficult.  There is lots of public transport; buses, taxis, underground - Leicester Square is the closest - but it depends on your own needs which is most suitable. There is one accessible toilet, unfortunately it is a long way from the accessible/wheelchair spaces. To go to the toilet, you must go from the Box in the theatre, go outside by the side door, round the outside of the theatre and back in the main entrance. The accessible toilet is just off the main entrance.  The accessible toilet is next to a Female toilet, so you may need to get past the queue for this.  The toilet has a sliding door (which probably does give the most space possible). It is a fairly standard accessible toilet.  When I was there the red emergency cord was tied up, when I untied it, it still didn't reach all the way to the floor. . . it now sports a lovely Euans Guide sign explaining why this is important!  Due to the age of the building, there probably are some limitations to the changes which can be made."
prince of wales theatre london,positive,Plenty of on street disabled spots near by. Clean and roomy.  No problems here.
princes hall aldershot,negative,"Poor.   only 4 disabled parking spots in the near vicinity. Others are not near enough to be accesssible if one has to push a wheelchair or walk with sticks or any other form of restriction.    Although a ""five minute"" walk is fine for the physically able, this could well be much further.  There is a drop off point but this is useless if the  driver is disabled. "
princes mall edinburgh,positive,There is no parking in this area however Princess St is only a minute or so away and has buses going to a range of places. There is also the trams as well that run between Edinburgh Airport and York St.  Waverly train station is also near to the venue so this gives us a good train service available.
princes square shopping centre glasgow,negative,"There is no car park and it is on a pedestrian street, the nearest train stations are Queen street and Central, there are also several bus stops near by and the closest Subway stations are Buchanan Street and St Enochs. There is no disabled parking outside the princes square shopping center in which the customers would have a long distance to walk up to Buchanan galleries car park or st Enoch. The main disabled toilets are on the ground floor so if the lifts and escalators were not accessible it would hinder the customer getting to the toilet. This is because they would have to take the stairs which would take longer and more energy consuming."
princes square shopping centre glasgow,positive,"Good sized disabled loo with grab rail, clean and accessible  With more than one accessible loo; the one we used was brilliantly signposted. Had a good wide door, plenty of space, grab rails and was spotlessly clean. Many parking facilities located in Glasgow city centre which is a walk away from Princes Square.  2 train stations close by. (Glasgow Queen street, Glasgow Central Station) A bus station also close by. (Buchanan Bus station) There was toilets on most floors right next to lift access."
princes street edinburgh,negative,On a side Street ad close as I could get to Princes Street. It took 20 minutes of driving to find it and it was too far for me to manage the walk.
princes street edinburgh,positive,"Parking in Edinburgh can be difficult as past experience showed us, so we traveled up by train, and arrived at Waverley station, which we found easy to get around, although involving some long pushes for my wife. To get around, we used the public buses, finding almost all of them will arrive or depart from some point along Princess street, and everyone on these buses were kind and helpful, and always managed to make use of the wheelchair section on each bus."
princess royal park banff,negative,"The stadium can be reachable by public transport. There are Keith and Huntly railway stations located in around 20 miles away from the ground, south-west and south-southwest directions respectively. MacDuff is the nearest bus station to the ground. A car is the easiest option if you're wanting to go to Princess Royal Park."
principality stadium cardiff,negative,"Ok toilet but after I'd collapsed and had a panic attack they needed to bring me a wheelchair where I was barged to the front of the queue because the people queuing (with radar access) ""didn't look disabled enough"""
principality stadium cardiff,positive,"I didn't use the car park but had used the train station  Staff at station were great. After game while thousands lined up, the staff were happy to assist me to platform missing the lines :) Toilets are easy to find but again only issue is staff were not stopping drunk people using them, a few were out of action due to folks throwing up in them There is a car park underneath the stadium with disabled parking you can prebook. Failing that, the park and ride buses are excellent.  Clean and easy to find. "
printworks coffee edinburgh,negative,Lothian buses 16 and 12 stop quite near.
proact stadium chesterfield,positive,"If you don't plan to take the train or coach to The Proact and you have access to an adapted vehicle, personally I would use it to get to stadium. If you phone customer services at the Tesco right next to the ground and talk to them nicely, they will let you park in the disabled parking there. The car park there is very accessible for a tail or side lift and the walk to the entrances takes only two minutes maximum. Disabled toilets appeared in both stands and were very modern and well equipped for wheelchair users. They were well organised to provide a lot of space and make it easy to transfer if that is what you require. They were undeniably the best disabled toilets I have seen at a football ground in my time of following the Blades in the lower leagues. The only issue was the automatic light turned off on several occasions and you have to keep moving to keep the lights on! "
projectionist glasgow,positive,"Given the location is an activity centre, there is a great deal of parking and many blue badge spaces. One thing we have noticed about very modern places, however, is that there is a great deal of pedestrian/pavement space between the parking and the buildings - and even between the drop-off space and the building. I presume this is for safety, but it can be difficult for those who are trying to keep walking if possible (using an aid), rather than relying on a wheelchair all the time.  The drop-off zone (pictured) is still some distance from the door. It has a lowered kerb only at the right hand side of the picture, which is unfortunate as that is where delivery vans tend to pull up when taking items into Soar. The toilet has grab rails on both sides and the red cord goes to the floor, although we pulled it out from where it was tucked behind a bin. The area is spacious enough for a wheelchair and carer but was a bit dark in one half. The lighting above the toilet was fine though.  A notice on the door says a key can be obtained from the bar but it was unlocked when we visited at lunchtime. It's not a RADAR lock. The other toilets are upstairs so some customers might use the accessible one when it's not  necessary."
promenade des anglais nice,positive,"There are lots of accessible, bus routes that run along the length of Promenade des Anglais."
provender melrose,negative,Transport options are limited. It seemed like mostly on street parking and the street parking was fairly busy when I visited. I’m not sure how great the bus options are. The nearest train station is at Galashields and it is a 4 mile walk along country paths from there. A taxi from the train station would maybe make this a better option.
providence place guest house bridlington,positive,"parked in private garden belonging to owners The toilet ,sink and shower was full accessible for wheelchair user and carer . Plenty of grab rails ,shower chair / commode. We were able to park in the car park at the hotel with great ease. Plenty of room for disabled vehicles with ramps etc.  Very easy to access with handrails etc"
prowler red london,positive,"Green Park station is 0.7 miles away and fully step free, but check before you travel, the lifts at this station are notoriously and disgracefully unreliable.   Tottenham Court Road station is much closer, and fully step-free (contact staff at the ticket barrier if you want to travel on the Central Line as they have to deploy a ramp manually), but check before you travel, the lifts at this station are notoriously and disgracefully unreliable.   Many buses serve Charing Cross Road and Shaftesbury Avenue.  I don't know about parking in Soho.   "
prudhoe castle prudhoe,negative,"Don't know how close buses pass but the castles quite a way above the main town. There is a dedicated car park but it's across and a small way up the side road from the castle entrance, then a walk up the steep entrance road (no cars). There are no blue badge spaces. The car park is loose gravel."
prudhoe castle prudhoe,positive,There's an accessible loo inside - in one of the Georgian interior rooms adjacent to the ticket office. Spacious and well equipped.
pryzm kingston kingston upon thames,positive,There were some blue badge parking spaces a walk from the venue that are free. No parking really close though. There is a station and buses nearby.  It was generally clean enough with everything in. Flush slightly difficult and water had a tendency to come out strong and fast from the tap!
public toilet callander,positive,"Car park opposite. Enough space for a manual wheelchair to turn. Might be a little tight for a large, powered wheelchair or mobility scooter. Grab rails. Fairly clean and tidy, with two bins, a sink, and an air hand dryer. Situated close to accessible bays in the car-park."
public toilets horncastle,negative,"Paper: yes. Hot water: moderately hot. Baby changing facilities: yes, but for an able-bodied person standing up only."
public toilets kilchattan bay,positive,5 if you have a car as you can park right outside. There is a bus stop nearby and we saw the bus zipping around the island but not sure if it's accessible or how often it runs. Clean& tidy - no radar key needed. Is parking just beside.  Very limited public transport though. Excellent.  see pic.
puccinis swinton,positive,"Car park is public and to the rear or there is street parking.  Bus stop on both sides of the road and directly in front of the restaurant. All on one floor, easily accessible with door assistance on request.  Did not have need to go in - visible at entry to restaurant."
puerto de la cruz puerto de la cruz,positive,"The nearest airport is Tenerife North but most scheduled flights from the UK go to Tenerife South. This is the way I travelled.  There is the option of bus, shuttle or taxi from the airport. I took a taxi. The journey took about 1 hour and when I travelled it cost £140 return (November 2018). "
pughs garden village morganstown,negative,Disabled parking available but could do with a few more spaces.
pughs garden village morganstown,positive,Spacious accessible loo available in cafe but door difficult to close independently without the provision of grab bar and easy to use lock.
pulborough brooks pulborough,positive,"We drove and there were well places disabled bays just outside, they even brought the scooter out to me in the car!!!"
punjabi junction edinburgh,negative,Parking available on street outside but no designated disabled parking. 
punjabi junction edinburgh,positive,"The buses on Leith Walk are great, there is some on-street parking but I think its quite restricted. The side-streets near the cafe have more parking options. The disabled loo itself is reasonably spacious with a grab rail on the right side. Doubles as baby changing area so there is a table in the corner. My daughter had no problem moving around in the loo however the small corridor outside is a bit tight and she had to back into the entrance of the men's loo to be able to open the door in to the restaurant. Apart from that she managed well. An easy fix would be to rehang the door from restaurant to toilet corridor the other way."
puregym derby derby,positive,"Gym is located in middle of city centre, there is on street parking for blue badge holders but it is often full. There is also a multi story car park and bus station with wheelchair accessible buses but it is a quite a walk away.  There was a toilet will contrasting grab rails. Toilet was left sided transfer. There was also a shower with seating and grab rails but no changing table. These were located on 1st floor so you have to use lift to access them by wheelchair.  If needed there is a changing places toilet located in the Intu centre which the gym is connected too.  There is an emergency help point on the wall between the accessible toilet and shower. There is also a lower water fountain. "
puregym glasgow hope street glasgow,positive,"I don't know what the parking is like, but it's city centre so I'm guessing there's good parking nearby. However, public transport wise - it's directly next to central station and there's a bus stop right outside the door!  The accessible toilet and shower are great, my only negative would be there there is regularly gym equipment placed in front of it. I've spoken with the gym manager about this and, hopefully, this will no longer happen. Fingers crossed!"
purple daisy gifts kilwinning,negative,There were no accessible toilets that I will was aware of and perhaps this is something that I would suggest to the local council the installation of a changing places accessible toilet would be a real asset to the team and perhaps could be located within the grounds of Kilwinning Abbey as it is right in the centre of the town and I will on visitor attraction.
purple daisy gifts kilwinning,positive,On this  occasion I travelled by car there is a car park situated just behind the main shops in Kilwinning and also accessible parking spaces on Kilwinning High Street itself.
purrple cat cafe glasgow,negative,We walked from Central Station for around 15 minutes to get there. There was a lot of uneven surfaces on the way there although the payment around the entrance was clear and flat. 
purrple cat cafe glasgow,positive,I could not see any signs for the toilet however staff point it out when you first arrive. There is one toilet with flat access and a wide door. The whole establishment appears to be very clean and tidy. 
quad derby,positive,"The Quad has no car park attached as it is in the centre of town. However, the assembly rooms has disabled car parking spaces which can be used by the Quad's customers and is just across the market square. There is also a  large taxi lane which is a few metres from the front door and these spaces are large enough to allow a enough space for a wheelchair. The Quad is also on a bus route and the bus stop is just outside the main entrance.  The toilets at the quad are accessible on every floor with an electric cord in all. The toilets are spacious to allow enough room to manoeuvre a wheelchair as well as space for the career. The toilets are well equipped with grab rails. They are also very tidy as they are regularly checked and cleaned.  "
quadrant shopping centre coatbridge,negative,As a result of the closure of the centre the car Park is likely to close soon as the area is prepared for redevelopment as housing.  The nearest  bus stops are on South Circular Road around 7 to 8 mins away 
quaker meeting house leeds,negative,There is no parking on site for any vehicle. You can park on the double yellows outside (if blue badge holder) as there is enough room for pavement users to still get past. Most people park on the road opposite or on the main road opposite the Meeting House.
quaker meeting house leeds,positive,"Space for carer, grab rails, clean and tidy but no alarm cord."
quantum coffee roasters cardiff,negative,"Large disabled loo, too many bins and baby changers in there but perfectly functional "
quantum coffee roasters cardiff,positive,"Yellow line Parking, public car parks and buses (Accessible)"
quay cafe dundee,negative,There was a disabled loo. The loo's are a bit small. No towels to dry hands.
quay cafe dundee,positive,"Bus It was okay. Downstairs disabled toilets are small and assistance is required to open the door I walk to there and it was easy to get to. We wheeled and walked. There is 24 hour parking in South Victoria Dock car park, just across the footbridge from the café.  There is an accessible loo - you need to ask the staff for the code to access the door which leads to it. The corridor is quite narrow, with a 90 degree turn into the loo, which was a bit tricky. The loo itself is small - I don’t think side transfer would be possible - but sensibly equipped with grab rails and a wash basin."
quay climbing centre exeter,positive,Parking next door at big car park. Only a very short distance to centre. Easy to find. Definitely accessible.
quayside anstruther,positive,Although there was blue badge parking it would be better if there were a couple more spaces. There was a big sign stating that misuse of blue badge spaces would result in a fine. We drove and I imagine it would be tricky to get there using public transport.
quayside lodge   king line cottages norfolk broads,positive,There is parking directly outside the lodge. The ramp to the lodge goes from this parking area. There was room for a wheelchair to manoeuvre and a carer to assist. There were adequate grab rails.
quayside mediacityuk salford,positive,"I parked in the underground car park in my Transporter van (the entrance is high enough to get under) &  I could reach the ticket to open the barrier.  I took the ticket with me & on my way out I had it validated, giving me 4 hours free parking.  I found the accessible bays near the entrance door and once inside I saw the lift which took me straight up to the mall.  There is a tram stop just by the BBC studios, which is a short walk away - maybe a bit far if you are pushing a chair & then walking round though on a sunny day it is a pleasant walk."
queen dome at pleasance potterow edinburgh,positive,On street parking in the surrounding areas plus good bus links.
queen elizabeth country park horndean,negative,"There's a bus stop inside the country park, but we didn't use the bus so no idea how reliable or accessible it is. Downside is the more accessible paths are at the top of this hilly site - the bus stop is at the bottom.  We drove, which meant we could go to the car park right at the top. There are a few disabled bays in each car park, which are free of charge. There were accessible loos even in the top car park.  However it was pretty dirty and shabby.  Some bright spark had fitted the padded back rest but it obstructed the toilet lid - so when sitting on the loo, you had to crouch forward with the toilet lid against your back!   No soap."
queen elizabeth hall london,negative,"If I hadn't been a VIP guest, the parking would have been a big fat zero, and therefore so would the whole review. But instead I had 'VIP Wheelchair Parking', which meant I could use the Blue Badge spaces that have been suspended since before 2012, and in fact made parking a 5-star experience. Granted, dedicated spaces have been freed up in the adjoining Haywards Gallery multistorey carpark, but as we repeatedly tell the management without result, many adapted vehicles - like mine - are too high for it. It was galling to see non-disabled people's lower cars taking up the spaces. There is one accessible toilet (and others) situated just off the artists' bar. (Don't get too excited; the artists drink their riders in their dressing rooms, so whether the bar is open depends on the number of touring crew.) The toilet worked for me in terms of being able to get out of my chair without breaking my neck climbing over it to get to the loo, and certainly meets 2015 standards as well as being clean on the night."
queen elizabeth olympic park london,negative,"Unfortunately it's about 20 minutes walk or wheel from Stratfird underground.  Buses may get you ckoser though we didn't take the bus.   Once at the entrance to the Park, it's five minutes walk/wheel to the Stadium. However the path is smooth."
queen elizabeth olympic park london,positive,"The loo I used was close to my seating area. It was radar key operated.  It was basic in terms of decor but well equipped, it was unisex."
queen elizabeth university hospital glasgow,negative,Heavy sliding doors a bit hard to open Parking has not been thought about when the place was built
queen elizabeth university hospital glasgow,positive,"More disabled spaces needed By car Big and spacey Good, but sliding door too heavy."
queen margaret university musselburgh,negative,The disabled toilet on the ground floor was very small.  The space was restricted for turning the wheelchair and the door was heavy to open and close and took up the space within the toilet.
queen margaret university musselburgh,positive,Weren't huge but facilities were fine. Might take a while to get used to.
queen mary 2 southampton,positive,We drove to Southampton and used the blue badge parking spaces offered by the parking company. On our return our car was very close to the terminal - delightful. All of the accessible loos we used were large and clean.
queen victoria hospital morecambe,negative,Not sure where the toilets were as not signage
queens hotel largs,positive,"Car park is a thin layer of gravel and may be hard to get over in a wheelchair but plenty of parking  available at the front of the hotel  Assistance would be needed to access the toilet as a door opens onto another door which may make it difficult alone, the toilet itself is good  with quite a lot of space and handrails "
queens house london,positive,"Greenwich is served by Greenwich National Rail station, which is fully step-free, and by Cutty Sark DLR station, which is likewise fully step-free. In addition numerous bus routes serve Greenwich, some of them embracing also North Greenwich Jubilee Line station, which is likewise fully step-free.  "
queens park church of scotland glasgow,positive,On street parking with local bus services a few streets away.  Very clean. Very roomy and to the rear of the venue. 
queens park glasgow,negative,There is no car park. There is lots of on-street parking. The easiest place to park is Langside Rd.  There are buses that stop near the park.  Queens Park train station is NOT accessible due to the large amount of steps to reach the platform.
queens spice south queensferry,positive,Good toilets . Good size.
queens view pitlochry,positive,They had disabled parking spots
quimper quimper,positive,"Plenty of blue badge spaces in the car parks I used, by the theatre and the river.  Public loos are easy to access and use. "
r34 at india of inchinnan renfrew,positive,"Ample disabled parking level walk ways very impressive building. Roomy disabled facilities, very clean"
rada bar london,positive,"The entrance to the Bar is on Malet Street which is a few minutes walk from Tottenham Court Road, British Museum and the Bloomsbury Squares. The nearest tube stations are Goodge Street, Warren Street, Russell Square, none of which are step free and Tottenham Court Road, which is step free. There are several buses that stop nearby on Tottenham Court Road. There is an accessible toilet close to RADA Bar.  The toilet was clean and spacious. It had grab rails and an emergency red cord which reached towards the ground."
radio rooftop bar london,negative,"There were toilets signposted but I didnt try them, sorry!"
radio taxi le havre,positive,Taxis are at exit from customs. All regulated prices so no need to haggle. 
radisson blu hotel berlin,positive,Taxi can stop close to the door. Some limited on Street parking but believe there is an underground car park close by didn't use toilets in the main part of hotel so can only comment on our bathroom!
radisson blu hotel birmingham,negative,"We did not like the look of nearby car park, non for hotel itself, but it is near, but would be worried about leaving the car here, it’s a rough looking area."
radisson blu hotel birmingham,positive,"Public toilet is near reception, pull handle door to get in, big area, could spin wheelchair around. It had grab rails and pull cord. However, it was very untidy, paper and bits on floor, seat needed a wipe, dirty W.C, (photo 7) and this seems the norm around public areas."
radisson blu hotel derby,positive,"A huge car park, with three disabled bays quiet close to hotels entrance.  DO REMEMBER TO REGISTER YOUR CAR to get out at barriers, or face a fine. It’s easy to follow sat NAV directions as well. Behind reception desk are the toilets, very clean, modern, plenty of room inside."
radisson blu hotel durham,positive,There are at least 7 spacious blue badge parking spaces close to the entrance althought these are often used by non blue badge holders ! You do pay for parking but so do all visitors. The ensuite accessible wetrooms are enormous. They are well laid out and would have 5 stars if they had larger and more accessible sinks. Note the Euan's guide red cord in the photo ! See photo - Image 1
radisson blu hotel edinburgh edinburgh,positive,"Close to Edinburgh Waverley Train Station and good city centre bus links. Spacious accessible toilet, you have to go through the door marked as the gents toilet into a corridor that has the accessible toilet. Taxi rank outside the hotel. Good pavement ramps even though a bit steep. That can't easily be helped but access into the hotel is excellent. This hotel is on the Royal Miles close to North Bridge - loads of buses. Getting to the hotel by taxi was easy and there’s a taxi rank right outside the door. There were accessible toilets off the lounge which were fine. The hotel is well situated for public transport. It is s short taxi ride from the station and from Princes Street.  The hotel has a taxi rank just outside the door.  There is no on-site parking for guests. Adjacent to the lounge area was an accessible toilet. It was large and well appointed."
radisson blu hotel glasgow glasgow,positive,Beside Central Station so ideal for trains and loads of buses nearby. No parking at hotel but you can get a reduced rate of £15  a night at nearby NCP carpark.  I've taken half a star off as the toilet in the bedroom was quite low down and only had a grab rail on one side.
radisson blu hotel letterkenny,positive,"Excellent big car park outside with several blue badge spaces. Good sized en suite accessible bathroom for the room, with good rails for the loo - but like the other two places we stayed in Ireland, strangely lacking in a drop-down rail to the left of the shower seat. Worth seeking out the large fragrant secret disabled loo tucked away on the ground floor near the breakfast room."
radisson collection hotel royal mile edinburgh,negative,"Accessible Toilets (Public Areas)  There is an accessible toilet toward the rear of the bar area. It was large and easy enough to manoeuvre. It does share the space with a baby changing unit. The door would have been easier to negotiate without the baby changing unit, attached to the wall, impeding the turning space."
radisson collection hotel royal mile edinburgh,positive,The G & V has an underground car park served by the lifts. Parking in this area is by prior arrangement.  Plenty of local buses and tour buses pass by the door and along the George IV bridge as well as the Royal Mile.   Taxis can drop off and pick up guests outside the front door. The hotel is a ten-minute journey from the Waverley railway station.
radisson red glasgow,positive,There's a car park at the back of the hotel.  We only used the facilities in our room so can't comment on the disabled toilet on ground floor other than there was one... saw the signs. 
radstone hotel larkhall,negative,The accessible toilet is at the back of the restaurant through a single door. The actual toilet door is a sliding one which I really like as it means I don’t have to pull back or push in. The toilets were clean and had enough room for myself in a wheelchair and one other person to move around safely. The lock is dodgy in the accessible toilet which I mentioned to staff so take care incase this hasn’t been fixed yet!
radstone hotel larkhall,positive,Accessible parking is outside the restaurant entrance and there are drop off areas at the entrance of the hotel.
rainbows ceramics york,negative,"The toilet which is situated at the back of the shop, does not have grab rails a step is present and is  quite small and narrow in size, which would make access to a wheelchair user difficult."
rainbows ceramics york,positive,Rainbows is located on the corner of Bootham and Gillygate within York city center. It is situated approximately 200 meters from the nearest bus stop at Museum Street or 200 meters from Bootham Row car park. Bootham Row car park provides 10 Blue Badge users spaces for free unlimited stay.
rainforest cafe   disney springs sumner,positive,The buses to downtown Disney springs are fully accessible and everything is flat and accessible.  The car park is a long way from the rainforest cafe though so I wouldn't recommend driving Clearly signed and clean
raithwaite estate whitby,negative,One disabled parking space in the small carpark in front of reception is not ideal. Plenty of parking is available in the main carpark but it is a short walk away from reception. If you are booked into the Keep there are 2 more disabled spaces outside the front door.
raithwaite estate whitby,positive,"Allocated and well marked spaces with level access everywhere I went. disabled toilets and handles in the changing rooms for the pool and no problem taking my chair into the pool area. They all had grab handles in the ones I used in the room and changing area for the pool There are accessible loos adjacent to both restaurants, bar area and in the Spa. All are very well equipped and spacious enough for my wheelchair. As you would expect in a hotel of this quality they are spotlessly clean."
rajdhani restaurant sheffield,positive,"Parked right outside. You could get a train there from Sheffield station and get off at the restaurant as well! Very good spacious toilet, easy to access. No spare stuff stored in there so easy to transfer."
ramada encore inverness,positive,"The hotel is in one of the main streets so parking might be a problem. Very close to the railway and bus stations. The accessible bathroom was superb. Nicely equipped, spotlessly clean, and plenty of space. Wet floor shower, lowered sink unit, and ample grab rails."
rancho grande puerto de la cruz,positive,"The restaurant is on a part of the padestrianised sea front. Although the immediate area outside the restaurant is on the level, to get to where the restaurant is involves walking down a slope regardless of which direction you approach it from. Both slopes have a hand rail. I have posted a photo of the stretch of sea front, which includes the steepest of the 2 slopes to give you an idea of how it looks. I found it very do-able in either direction with my crutch and I saw lots of people with walking aids in the area."
rathsallagh country house dunlavin,positive,The staff directed us to a parking space directly outside the accessible room (which is in a separate building to the main hotel/dining area) There was a big accessible bathroom with grab rails next to the dining hall. The bathroom in the room had grab rails and a wet room style shower (picture included)
ratp tramway paris,positive,"Can't comment on parking. The tram network offers good connections with Paris bus services, which are wheelchair accessible, and with the Metro, most of which is not."
ravenglass eskdale railway ravenglass,positive,"Ample parking but we did have to pay. I think access is also possible to Ravenglass railway station . Check the website it's very informative  Clean and easy to use.  Spacious, well placed grab rails, red emergency cord"
ravenscraig regional sports facility motherwell,positive,On approach to gated car park there were plenty of staff to direct me to car park instructing me after parking to make my way to main entrance.   Absolutely loads of blue badge parking spaces and many many more spaces within easy reach of entrance
rayleigh town museum rayleigh,positive,This museum is in the High Street with plenty of buses passing the door and a good car park close by. I was surprised how spacious the toilet was bearing in mind the overall size of the museum.
raystede centre for animal welfare ringmer,positive,Good parking. easy access with wheelchair into centre from car park. Very clean and easy to get too.
reading buses reading,positive,Excellent transport. Service every 10 minutes.
reading railway station civic centre,positive,"I did not see it, but my friend was satisfied Great parking for blue badge holders, easy access, fully designed for disabled access everywhere."
red cup cafe harrow,positive,"This cafe is on a busy high street, so the parking doesn't look promising at first, but then it turns out there are two pay and display car parks just round the back, and blue badge users are free. An unexpectedly big wheelchair loo for this size of cafe, with plenty of rails and impressively clean. Left me with a good feeling about the place that inspired me to write this review."
red funnel ferries southampton,positive,"Although it is possible to go on the car ferry as a foot passenger, normally you will arrive by car. On check in to the ferry you need to tell them you are disabled and you also need to specify if you are in a wheelchair. You are directed into a special lane and asked to put your hazard lights on when you board so on board staff know you are disabled. There is an accessible disabled toilet. This is always clean and is completely flat entry."
redcraigs lodges aberdeen,negative,"Toilet as described above. One suction-type grab rail available, which you can put to the left side of the toilet, which is a standard toilet."
redcraigs lodges aberdeen,positive,"You can park right outside your lodge, which is tarmac surface for parking. I went by car so not sure about public transport though I do know that the bus services in Aberdeen are generally very good."
redesdale arms hotel moreton in marsh,positive,"We could park outside our room, but no marked disabled space and slopes to negotiate to get to main bit of hotel. A step in main corridor."
redfields garden centre church crookham,positive,Plenty of Blue Badge parking by the main entrance. The main car park is also within easy distance of the entrance. Disabled toilet with plenty of space & grab rails.
reeds path loop cromarty,negative,We had to drive there but there is also a bus service from Inverness to Cromarty.  Parking in Cromarty is mostly on-street as far as we could see; we parked in the ferry car-park but I’m not sure if you’d be able to do this when the ferry’s running.  There is also a disabled parking space outside the Hugh Miller Institute (the library)  in Church St.   
reel cinema chippenham,negative,There is no disabled parking on site. There is a small public car park 250m away with limited disabled spaces. A bit of a walk down a side corridor 
reeperbahn hamburg,positive,"We took the Ubahn, despite its age lifts and raised platforms have been added to help with access. Wait on the raised part of the platform and press the button on the side of the train to open doors. Platform level with train, no great gap. "
reflections bistro dawlish,positive,"Dawlish Train Station and bus stops are a 3-5 minute walk away.  There is street and car parking close by, but be aware the area can be very busy. The door to the accessible toilet is directly off the seating area. The toilet was clean and spacious with grab rails. There is no emergency cord, but I think given location I think if you called out for help you would be easily heard. "
refugio dos burros lagoa,positive,Worth checking The Refúgio dos Burros in Estômbar when open 
regal lady scarborough,negative,"The toilets are small and I couldn't see them accommodating a wheelchair unfortunately, though that's understandable. You could visit one of the many public loos along the promenade before boarding - just make sure you don't over do it at the bar during the voyage."
regal lady scarborough,positive,On-street parking a short walk from the harbour.
regent hotel oban,negative,"There is no parking at the hotel there is a car par across the road that has Blue badge spaces however there is restrictions in place 3 hour time limit.  There is a bus stop across the road used by local buses, This is also a one way street"
regents park london borough of camden,positive,We'd been nearby on Baker Street and hadn't realised how close Regent's Park was. There's lots of bus stops nearby and there was disabled parking signposted on the map of the area.
reichstag building berlin,positive,"We got there using riverside footpaths. Public transport in Berlin is generally wheelchair-friendly, but not all S-bahn and U-bahn stations have level access. The excellent BVG (Berlin Transport) website is very helpful in finding those that do. The toilets are OK but few in number and you might well have to queue for a while."
reiss london,negative,"No step-free stations nearby, and absurd to even dream about parking in Covent Garden. Plenty of bus routes will drop you off a few blocks away in Shaftesbury Avenue or Strand."
rejects kirkcaldy,positive,Ample parking on and off street.  Car park is at the back of the store.  I did not check the toilets on this visit. I am told there is a new accessible lift on the second floor by the cafe. I gave tha manager a couple of Euan's red cord cards. I will check next visit. 
remai modern saskatoon,positive,"There is accessible parking right outside the entrance The downstairs loos were both accessible, one with electric doors. They are large inside but I was mystified that there were only two handbars - one behind the loo and the other on the wall by the loo and sink. I am used to seeing another which would be on your right when seated. I was not sure how someone could manage this on their own if they needed support to move from a chair or if they would need support when standing. "
remploy edinburgh,negative,No easy parking in the immediate vicinity. Accessible buses pass along the street.
remploy edinburgh,positive,Well designed accessible loo.
renaissance london heathrow hotel longford,positive,Disabled toilets available.
renfrew health social care centre renfrew,positive,Disabled parking spaces at front of building.  McGills bus service no 26 runs past building with stops directly outside. 3 disabled toilets (one each floor)  Clean and fresh with room for carer.

renfrew street glasgow,positive,Very easy to get to one person came by car and another by bus. and public transport is very reliable.
renfrew town hall and museum renfrew,negative,The venue is in the centre of Renfrew which is serviced by a regular bus route.   There is no designated car park for the Town Hall but there is free parking and disabled spaces nearby.
renfrew town hall and museum renfrew,positive,"The disabled toilet was easily accessible, it was clean and fresh.   There was room to manoeuvre and space for a carer.  Grab rails were fitted."
resorts world birmingham birmingham,positive,"Arriving by train, get off at Birmingham International station, take the lift up to concourse level, exit station, turn right and walk along the large passageway to the lift at far end by staircase, go down to exhibition hall level, go across the centre passing food outlets, take lift down and then walk across and along a pleasant walk by lake side (photo 2) that will take you into the World Resort centre itself. (photo 3) The lower path as you approach will take you inside by a number of food outlets and take the lift up to “0” level.  (photo 6) The path going slightly uphill to  your right, will take you inside straight onto level “0”. (photo 9). It sounds a lot, but 15 minutes will do the trick. ====================================================================  Arriving by car, if it’s perhaps for a days visit, we suggest you use the World Resorts  own car park. Follow SAT NAV directions B40 1NT towards NEC.  Drive along to left for World Resort, and as approaching manned  barrier, get into right hand lane and go up ramp for World Resort parking. Collect ticket at barrier, follow to right to park up by the sign for shopping. Take the lift just inside, ignore ticket machines, and get off on level “0”.  Enjoy the shops and restaurants. (READ details on cost of parking on main summery above)  However, if it’s for overnight stays, then the various Hotels own private car parks would be the cheapest way for you, although it will mean shortish walks to get into World Resort. "
rest bay porthcawl,negative,Disabled toilet available but basic.  Best to drive up to car park to access toilets.
rest bay porthcawl,positive,Disabled Bays on road close to waterfront.  More in car-park 200 yds from front  but nearer toilets and temp cafe.
restaurant fuhrich vienna,positive,Can't comment on the parking.  The tram stops in the Opernring and Karlsplatz U bahn station are a few minutes away.
restaurant martin wishart edinburgh,negative,"A couple of disabled bays and on-street parking available on streets nearby. It's great that they have one, *BUT* it has clearly been designed for very small people in very small wheelchairs.   There is very little floorspace. I really struggled to get in and close the door - without assistance this would've been impossible. Grab rails are available, but pretty much rendered useless given the lack of space to transfer.   Loo lets restaurant down big time."
restaurant martin wishart edinburgh,positive,As above.
restaurante la boheme xabia,positive,"La Boheme can be found on the promenade at El Arenal Beach and there are a variety of disabled parking spaces behind the El Arenal Beach area. You will usually find one which is free even in high season. You can walk or drive closer to the promenade at the front down a variety of side roads and walkways. It is a really flat wide area with plenty of space. The disabled toilet at La Boheme (Bohemians) Restaurant, Javea is located at the rear of the restaurant. It is again labelled ladies and access to it is narrow. Again an average size wheelchair would get through the swing doors but a larger electric chair may not."
revitalise netley waterside house netley,positive,There is parking outside. Revitalise has its own accessible minibuses. When you arrive there is a number you can call & someone will help take your luggage to your room. All toilets & bathrooms are accessible. There are wheel in wet rooms.
revitalise sandpipers southport,positive,"Excellent transport to travel into town and to the trips provided. Disabled parking also available. Varied toilets facilities to accommodate most, if not all levels of disability."
revolucion de cuba leeds,positive,"Easy to find, well signposted. Slight navigation around chairs to reach toilet, but spacious toilet area for manoevering."
revolucion de cuba liverpool,negative,Q car-park and bus stops - 5 mins away
revolucion de cuba liverpool,positive,Radar key lock - Very clean and spacious with decent hand dryer. Grab rails by the toilet
revolution bar york,negative,"small, another heavy door, no way to prop the door open so you're battling with the door and trying to wheel in."
revolution bar york,positive,"There is an easily locatable toilet on the ground floor which is big enough for wheelchair access. There are grab rails and toilet rails in the toilet, as well as a emergency pull cord which is within reaching distance from the toilet itself. The toilet area was clean and pleasant and there was enough room for a carer, however there wouldn't be much room to move around and manoeuvre.  Firstly the toileting facility was not solely designed for disabled use, and is unisex.  It has level access and there is grab rails available, transfer on the left is available also however there is not a flush on this side. The emergency pull cord alarm is situated to the left of the toilet however it does not reach the floor. Mirrors available are placed at an angle for better use and the sink is reachable from the toilet. There is no key needed to use this facility. A disabled toilet is provided on the ground floor. The toilet and lift are situated next to the bar. During busy times this could mean access to these facilities are blocked by people queuing to be served at the bar. Large toilet big enough for wheelchairs and walking aids. Multiple grab rails inside and a pull cord for emergency's. "
revolution blackpool,positive,"Taxis and Bus stops outside the rear entrance, Tram stop around the corner  Multi-storey car park opposite the rear entrance Very clean with decent hand dryer and hand wash, also has baby changing facilities"
revolution edinburgh,positive,Parking is on chamber street
rhs garden harlow carr harrogate,positive,"There is disabled parking within 50 yards of the entrance. Large, clean and room for carer if necessary. Grab rails. I drove into the first large car park on the left hand side, with disabled access close to the entrance of the gardens. There was a short walk from the car park down a gentle slop, there are are 3 steps if you prefer to walk down steps.  There is a drop off/collection point available at Crag Lane adjacent to the shop building. Fully accessible toilets, with hand rails, and  plenty of room for manoeuvring an wheelchair. "
rhs garden hyde hall chelmsford,positive,There is plenty of parking here but because of the scale of the place you will still have to walk about 30 yards to the entrance. I don't know if buses come into the grounds but the driveway when you enter is about half a mile long. There are disabled toilets at the top of the garden and by the cafe near the entrance.
rhs garden rosemoor great torrington,positive,Plenty of parking outside. Free and close to the entrance. Very clean and accessible No trouble parking in designated spot. Can’t comment on public transport although the place is only about two minutes from the nearest town. Good toilets all around the site but no changing places. Some bigger than others so transfer easier in some than others. All clean though 🙂
rhs garden wisley garden,positive,"Plenty of disabled parking by the entrance. There are around 30 accessible parking spaces which are well signposted. However, we have been before when every space was full as it's popular and serves the plant nursery (amazing collection of Kane's to buy). Toilets by the glass house and in the cafe opposite both have extra wide spaces. I prefers the cafe ones as the support rail in the other ones was a bit far back to hold easily. There are no toilets with hoists/benches.  They all have baby changing units but the toilet I used didn't have an accessible baby changing unit as there was no free space underneath. Large car park with disabled spaces near to entrance Clearly marked on map with good signage.  Large easy access. "
rhs garden woking,positive,Lots of disabled parking bays.
rhs wakehurst haywards heath,positive,Car Park at Venue
rhu shandon parish church rhu,positive,Bus stop 500 yards Disabled parking for rear and side exit Conventional disabled toilet with handrails BS5810 standard. Room for carer. Right hand transfer.
rhyl beach rhyl,negative,"Disabled loo, a good walk up from the beach. No good for us as we needed a changing place Council public accessible WC with grab rails.   There is a charge to use it and the door automatically opens after 20 minutes"
rhyl beach rhyl,positive,Excellent parking in good bays and good access to the beach front and liquid force cafe. But a bit pricey for parking. Its the carpark before the RNLI for the cafe and wheelcahirs Public Car park with blude badge parking spaces.   All Blue Badgesspaces  are pay and display
rhyl miniature railway rhyl,negative,"Free car park is several hundred yards away, but it is flat and plenty of bays."
rhyl miniature railway rhyl,positive,"Very clean, reasonably standard toilet - see photo.  "
ria de bilbao maritime museum bilbao,positive,We walked from our hotel but generally Bilbao is easy to get around. Trams are accessible and frequent and pavements are broad and generally level.  The museum is sited under the Palacio Euskalduna bridge near the dry docks and can be difficult to find the entrance. 
ribble steam railway and museum preston,positive,There are designated spaces round the entrance. We have never had a problem parking even on event days. It is ok. It has hand rails both sides and a pull chord to the floor that you would be able to reach from anywhere in the room. For us it was find however if you need to slide to transfer onto the toilet you can only do so from 1 side. It is quite tight and has a baby change in aswell.   
ribby hall village wrea green,negative,Not close to nature trail. Hard to find spaces for non badge holder vehicles. several spaces for badge holders however they weren't close in varied spaces they were all grouped together near the shops.
ribby hall village wrea green,positive,"Standard disabled toilet in Papa Johns, didn't see a hoist in Papa John's toilets. Accessible loos in all areas."
richard dunn sports centre bradford,positive,"The centre is on a number of bus routes from the bus station in Bradford town centre and surrounding areas, it is well sign posted and is located near the Bradford Bulls rugby stadium. If traveling by car the centre has a large car park with several disabled parking bays.   The disabled toilet can be found easily and it was clean and tidy, it has grab rails and emergancy pull cord in situ. There appears to be plenty of room to maneuver a wheelchair and/or a carer to be present.  However it was not noted on this visit if there are disabled toilets on other levels at the centre.  "
richer sounds leeds,negative,There aren't any parking or transport. Multi storey nearby has no blue badge discount or disabled spaces.
richmond railway station richmond,negative,"There is a wheelchair-accessible toilet near the ticket-gates. It's spacious. You can gain access using a RADAR key. The RADAR lock on the outer gate is horrible - ramshackle and extremely difficult to use. Try turning your key in both directions. It's very annoying. One star lost for this.  If you don't have a RADAR key you may have trouble finding staff to unlock the toilet gate and door for you.   On the day I visited, the red emergency cord had been thoughtlessly tied up around a grab-rail. This is a very silly thing to do. See my picture below. The red emergency cord must hang freely all the way down to the floor, so that it can be reached by anyone who might fall to the floor and need to summon assistance. Two stars lost for this.   I spoke to a member of staff who had been cleaning the toilet, and explained why the red cord must hang free, but he didn't get the point and wasn't in any case at all interested."
richmond theatre richmond,negative,There is plentiful street parking so long as you arrive at least 30 minutes in advance. There were staff outside monitoring arrivals and it would have been possible to obtain help if needed.
richmond theatre richmond,positive,"I travelled by public transport. The nearest tube and train station is Richmond, which has a lift to the platforms. It's a busy station with frequent services from London and the South East. The theatre is on a road parallel to the main shopping street so there are also numerous buses  that stop close by. From the train station it is about a five minute mainly level walk to the theatre. My personal favourite way of getting there from the train/tube station avoids the shoppers in the high street, is to turn left out of the station and cross the road at the first set of traffic lights. When you're on the other side of the road directly in front of you is a padestrianised alleyway called Old Station Passage. Continue along the alleyway and turn left at the end. There is then a railway bridge with a slight slope up and down. There are a couple of large, old building before the theatre.  There was an accessible toilet at the back of the stalls. It does not have push button door but it is spacious, clean and has grab rails.  Sorry I've forgotten if it has an emergency alarm. This toilet is next to one of the entrances to the stalls so if it's in use you are waiting in quite a narrow entranceway.  "
ricoh arena coventry,negative,"There were only two toilets in the disabled area for away fans. They are big enough to move the wheelchair around and position it alongside the toilet for a transfer and it is relatively clean, however there was a small number of grab rails to provide stability.  "
ricoh arena coventry,positive,"If you are using a car there are many disabled parking spaces within 20 metres of the away end, which cost £10. This is the same across the whole of the stadium and Coventry offer a season pass to their supporters. If you are traveling by public transport you can get a connecting train to the Ricoh Arena Train Station, just under 100 metres from the stadium itself."
ridley park blyth,positive,"We just wandered along the sea front  from our hotel to reach the park.  I did note that on the street we entered from that there was designated disabled parking.  At the other end of the park, I spotted a decent sized car park"
rievaulx abbey york,positive,Good amount of parking space but can be tricky if it is a busy day Disabled toilet is in the visitor centre not in the toilet block in the car park. Very clean.
rijksmuseum amsterdam,positive,"The Rijksmuseum is accessible by many forms of transportation.  It takes an average of 11 minutes to arrive on a bicycle from the Amsterdam Central Station.  It is also accessible by tram, bus, or taxi.  If traveling by tram, look for the ITS symbol to ensure full accessibility.  If arriving by car, there is a nice accessible parking garage located at the Museumplein,  The company Accessible Travel Netherlands can arrange accessible taxis for you."
rio beach london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby, but several bus routes will drop you in the high street."
rio cinema london,positive,"There are excellent public transport links. Dalston Kingsland is the nearest station but it is not step free. However, Dalston Junction is step free and is about a 5 minute walk away. Both stations are part of London Overground. There are also a number of buses that stop just outside or very close by. On the ground floor their is an accessible toilet. It was spacious and clean. It has grab rails and an emergency cord (which did not reach to the ground). The accessible toilet door is clearly labelled. Their website says that they are planning to add another accessible toilet in the basement shortly."
ripley castle harrogate,positive,"The free public car park is situated 0.2 miles from the castle entrance, access is via level, tarmac pavement with some crossing of cobbled areas, this car park also contains a disabled toilet.  There are two other areas nearer to the castle which contain disabled parking spaces both within a few metres of the entrance. The disabled toilet located in the entrance/gift shop is clean, well supplied and accessible.  The doors to the rear of the shop which offer access to the rest of the attraction have to be negotiated as the toilet is located to the left, these doors can be held back to help with access.  The toilet itself would allow room for a wheelchair user to manoeuvre and includes enough space for a carer.  There were other disabled toilets available in the main village car park, the castle, tearooms and the Boars Head, pub and restaurant in the village. Parked right at the entrance. Clearly signposted and accessible with hand rails."
rising sun inn crewe,positive,I needed to ask where the accessible toilet was and a staff member brought the key and showed me. You have to go back out to the porch where the loo was but it didn't open straight into the path of people going in or out of the pub. The toilet area was clean with everything within reach. The hand dryer was actually a good one and powerful one. There was a handrail but it would have needed moving down. I couldn't have done it on my own or reached it due to the sanitary box next to the loo. There wasn't a Changing Places toilet and it would have been a squash to have 2 people in there plus a wheelchair.
ristorante fratelli ponteland,positive,Restaurant shares disabled parking with the Sainsbury's next door which provides level access to the lift for the restaurant. Easy enough to find. Uses the radar key which you can get behind the bar if you forgot yours. Grab rails inside.
river beat gateshead,negative,"Unfortunately, no car park is available apart from a public car park (with Blue Badge bays) which is located about 200 yards away. However, outside the restaurant, there are yellow lines, so it feasible to park there for up to 3 hours with the badge. There is no public transport access near the restaurant. It would be necessary to alight a bus on Newcastle Quayside opposite and push across the Swing Bridge. Distance would be about 400 yards with some inclines. The wheelchair accessible toilet is located just outside the restaurant double doors. It's a relatively small cubicle without a transfer area and it is difficult to turn around. However, it is functional for someone who doesn't need to transfer and can reverse out of cubicle."
river house stirling,positive,Car park with 4 disabled spaces. The restaurant is on the outskirts of Stirling beside the motorway so not sure about public transport  Great disabled toilet - I left a Euans guide card
river ness walk inverness,positive,"There is parking on the road along the North side of the river, or at the theatre or swimming pool. Lots of space. Close to city centre public transport links. "
river ouse   lendall bridge to water end walk york,negative,NA - Unfortunately there are no disabled toilets nearby and a local pub/resturant would need to be found. The closes of which would be in York Centre
river ouse   lendall bridge to water end walk york,positive,A carpark on Marygate offers excellent disabled spaces which are large and close to the attrations. The carpark is pricey however.
river rowing museum mill meadows,negative,"Two accessible loos. , so we were told.  Easy to find, but, upstairs one wasn't there!  Downstairs loo enterance to toilet block, had heavy doors, so needed assistance.  Heavy door to access disabled loo, again needed assistance.  Grab rails, wide throughout, spacious, but, handle on cistern broken.  Therefore, unable to flush.  "
river rowing museum mill meadows,positive,Free car park at rear.  Disabled parking bays.
riverbank bar restaurant helensburgh,positive,Disabled parking bay with area of dropped kerb on the street directly outside the restaurant at the end of a row of other parking bays. Large car park at the pier across the road too.
riverbank chinese buffet norwich,positive,"The entrance to the toilets is for some reason through two dividers which might be difficult to access in a larger wheelchair. The door may also be a little difficult without help. The disabled toilet itself is outstanding - spacious, clean, the toilet can be accessed from either side."
rivergate shopping centre irvine,positive,"Multi-storey carpark, level 5 has disabled parking. Asda carpark next to rivergate has lots of disabled parking. Large space one both in men's and women's toilet and also a separate unisex one. All clean and well maintained. If I drove to the multi-story carpark they would have disabled parking and they also have a bridge to get up with no stairs for wheelchairs or peaks. The nearest train station is across the road from the rivergate shopping centre, the nearest bus stop is outside primark. There is 3 accessible loos in the shopping centre and they are very easy to find they are also very clean and tidy inside and have handrails to hold onto to and there is enough space for at least 2 carers"
riverhill cafe bar restaurant helensburgh,negative,"Well...... The accessible toilet was interesting!!  There is one male, one female and one accessible toilet.  These are in the small entrance area, and people can be waiting in this area too. It is quite a tight turn to get from the restaurant to the accessible toilet.   I was very surprised to find the accessible   toilet is where they also store the children's highchairs!! Meaning the toilet was actually not accessible... And that all young children have a very unhygienic dining experience!! (would you want your dining table leaning against a toilet?)  It has a sliding door, which obviously saves on space, but can be tricky to close and lock.   There is a folding support arm to the left side (if sitting on the toilet) but this could not be used due to the highchairs.  The emergency red cord was tied in a knot around this, and could not be used.  The sink is immediately in front of the toilet, leaving little room if transferring.   The baby changing area is also in this toilet "
riverhill cafe bar restaurant helensburgh,positive,"In the town centre, it is only one street away from Helensburgh Central Train Station.  The town is served by local buses which have stops nearby.   Riverhill does not have its own car park, but there are car parks and street parking in the town. "
riverhill coffee bar glasgow,negative,Again in terms of access for wheelchairs or assistive aids particular with mobility issues these toilets are not accessible they are down a steep and spiralling stair case. 
riverhill coffee bar glasgow,positive,The venue is in the heart of Glasgow city centre. There is a NCP car just a few metres away and also trains and busses all within a very short distance. There are also parking spaces outside the shop but they seem to be like gold dust and probably a little tricky to get one.
riverlife edinburgh,positive,"Good toilet, well equiped"
riverside farm york,positive,"The sign for the toilet was clear, and when heading in that direction, a staff member ensured that an individual from our group was heading in the right direction highlighting how friendly the staff were on our visit. Access to all toilets at this venue is flat with a disabled toilet also being available for use. During our visit, all the individuals visiting the toilet did not require the disabled toilet therefore I am unable to comment on the availability of facilities such as grab rails, however the toilet was of good size.  Pleanty of spaces and disabled parking for my dad and friend to go in. Easy to find, situated to the left of the entrance furthest wall on right.  V clean The toilets can be found at the right-hand side of the bar, and offers a male, female and accessible toilet, with nappy changing facilities. The accessible toilet is spacious with a grab-rail and emergency pull-cord."
riverside ice and leisure centre chelmsford,positive,They currently have building work going on in the car park which means spaces are restricted. I couldn't find the temporary entrance on this visit but there are plenty of car parks nearby as it is so close to the town centre.
riverside inn dundee,positive,There were plenty of disabled parking spaces at the restaurant and they are a reasonable distance from the front entrance.
riverside leisure park wooler,positive,Space to side of caravan. Did not use public transport Perfect
riverside lodge   king line cottages norfolk broads,negative,At this cottage parking is about 25mtrs away  across the road but you can drop off and collect outside. Other cottages have parking at the side.
riverside lodge   king line cottages norfolk broads,positive,Seat raisers are available free of charge.
riverside museum glasgow,positive,"Dedicated blue badge parking bays are situated close to the main entrance. Arriving by accessible taxi I was dropped off at the Taxi point which was a short distance from the main entrance. There's also a bus service from the city centre to Riverside and the city sightseeing bus also stops there. With plenty of accessible toilets the museum caters for all requirements. I think there is disabled parking although I am not 100% sure. The accessibility is good but not great as there are stairs up to buses or trains in some parts of the museum which wheelchair users would probably have to miss out on I arrived by Hop On bus but plenty free parking.  A well equipped and spacious loo combining baby changing. What a pity there does not appear to be a changing places toilet (it might have been hidden away). It has lost a star as the red cord was tied firmly to the hand rail. Preventing both the rail from dropping and the alarm from activating. I issued them a red card.  Easy blue badge parking on the main road in so lots of space to manoever.  About 12 spaces adjacent to the entrance.  Spaces slightly short (ie don't have the 1.2m markings at the end), so reverse in and use the wide footpath if required. Blue Badge parking spaces. Plus can get there using bus from City Centre I believe. You can visit the Tall Ship at the same time. Brilliant - spacious, clean and tidy. By bus - the tourist sightseeing buses, like local buses allow one wheelchair, stop directly outside the museum. Unsure about local buses. By taxi - the taxi drop off point is directly outside the museum. If one is needed for return journey, don't forget to ask the driver for a phone number to get picked up again as there is no taxis waiting outside. There is a good number of accessible toilets and they are a good size so very easy to manoeuvre. There are lots of disabled parking spaces available at the front of the museum. It is also a registered stop on the Glasgow tour bus which has wheelchair access. There are some very spacious toilets toilets with handrails. Sadly no changing places facility that I could see, There are lots of disabled bays A row of disabled parking bays are present next to the main entrance. I didn't drive but the disabled parking looked convenient. Accessible loos on each floor and good lift in between. a lot of disabled spaces, no public buses goes  to the museum but you  can get a bus to Partick bus station and walk across  a great changing places toilet and there is signs pointing to it "
riverside walk dundee,positive,"There is free parking along the Riverside Walk after Tesco’s which is all a smooth surface but they aren't disabled parking spaces, if you exit your car at the back there is room for this. There is also plenty of council car parks within the city centre of Dundee where you can park which would only be a 5 minute walk away. If you are a Blue Badge holder you can park in the council car parks for free.  With being in the city centre of Dundee the train station is a 2 minute walk away and there are bus stops nearby that can take you to different areas of Dundee and Angus. "
roadchef hamilton motorway services hamilton,negative,A good basic wheelchair accessible toilet with grab rails on both sides there is no room for a care giver  Radar key required to open the door 
roadchef hamilton motorway services hamilton,positive,The car park was not that busy and there are 3 Blue Badge spaces these are located nearest to the main service building its self 
roast restaurant london,positive,"Parking is possible however, we arrived on the Tube. Jubilee line at London Bridge is both near by and accessible. There was an accessible toilet in the entrance area. Modern and large enough to accommodate a sizeable powerchair."
robatary wakefield,negative,No parking immediately outside the restaurant. On street parking is available further up the road.   The restaurant is about 10 minutes from Wakefield Westgate railway station. 
robatary wakefield,positive,"Fully accessible toilet, easily found. Enough space to get around. Loo had grab rails, was clean and tidy. Mirror was at sitting level. Might be a little tight for a carer. "
robert burns centre film theatre dumfries,positive,"Very small carpark with one designated accessible parking space, my companion had to drop me off and park along the street. Street parking available. Public bus stances are a 10 minute walk away on the other side of the river, but the bridge has several steps at one end of it"
robert dyas london,negative,"There are plenty of bus routes in the vicinity, but no step-free trains stations. "
roberts rock and ices blackpool,negative,Limited on street parking or some car parks but some distance from the front. The tram does go along the street and past the door.
rochester cathedral rochester,negative,I came by train. Rochester station has friendly helpful staff. But they didn't tell St Pancras that I would be appearing at the end of my return journey to London. So: no ramp assistance at St Pancras. Luckily the train guard was able to deploy a ramp for me. But the communication failure between Rochester & St Pancras was annoying.
rochester cathedral rochester,positive,"An absolutely perfect accessible toilet right inside the cathedral, with everything laid out just right, plenty of space, clean, tidy, and the emergency cord the right length and not tied up out of reach.  One comical oddity: to reach the accessible toilet you have to pass through what appears to be a kitchen area. But this doesn't affect my five-star toilet rating."
rock roll hall of fame cleveland,negative,There is public disabled parking on the street but this is not reserved for the hall of fame.
rock roll hall of fame cleveland,positive,Accessible toilets were easy to find and well sign posted. They have grab rails and space for a carer. There was not an emergency red cord in the accessible toilet.
rockcliffe beach rockcliffe,negative,There is a toilet block discreetly hidden at end of beach. Step free access. There is an accessible loo within the ladies loo. It does look a bit aged and as if it has seen better days but was serviceable and great to have it there.
rockcliffe beach rockcliffe,positive,We drove and as it was not very busy parked right at the beach. There is a blue badge space right at the end of the beach.
rockfish weymouth,negative,"Our hotel was only 5 mins walk away, so hubby was able to use his walking frame, but level access for wheelchairs "
rocksalt edinburgh,negative,On street parking directly outside but can sometimes be difficult finding a parking space as there didn't seem to be designated accessible parking spaces.  Public transport - bus stop nearby but unsure of what number bus. On street parking
rocksalt edinburgh,positive,An accessible toilet is adjacent to the lower area of the cafe / coffee shop.
roker beach sunderland,positive,"Several disabled parking spaces located next to the promenade with easy access from car park to promenade. Accessible toilet was really easy to find with the option of both a standard disabled toilet and a changing places toilet. The changing places toilet was really spacious and included grab rails, a closomat toilet, adjustable sink, changing bed, shower and ceiling-track hoist. Both disabled toilets were clean and well maintained. Very easy to drive to, though we came in through Sunderland, which is quite industrial. It was hard to imagine that we were so clise to the beach until we actually arrived. We parked at the Harbour View car park. It is pay and display but blue badge holders don't have to pay. There were several blue badge spaces. The ground was a little uneven in the car park but manageable. There were several toilets. We used the accessible toilet in the main block. It was RADAR locked and very clean. I was hoping to have a look at the changing places toilet but that is on a RADAR lock plus a number pad and we couldn't work out how to open it."
roman army museum hexham,positive,"Disabled parking bays were right next to a level pathway leading to the enteance. No problem getting a blue badge parking space near the entrance. Wow! Open the door to this loo and you are inside a rich Roman house, with the walls decorated with murals from the time. It was also clean and spacious, but the main thing is that it was just so beautiful. It's quite touching when you discover disabled facilities that haven't been treated as an afterthought or second best."
ronaq indian restaurant edinburgh,negative,There is a loo that is big enough for a small mobility scooter but it's tight. It's better with a chair. It does have a handrail by the toilet but it's quite low. It is also through a push door before the actual toilet door which can be awkward to negotiate. 
ronaq indian restaurant edinburgh,positive,Plenty of parking nearby. A short walk / wheel to bus stops.
ronnies cabs elgin,positive,They picked me up from outside my house and took me to Elgin Cathedral.
roomzzz leeds,positive,"Plenty of room in the wetroom, inc for a hoist."
roots eastbourne,positive,"Roots is in Eastbourne town centre, a few minutes walk from Eastbourne railway station. Also a number of buses stop close by."
rosa apartment   crystal suites chez helena krakow,positive,"Crystal Suites that own the apartment pre-booked me a taxi from Krakow airport. The taxi driver was waiting for me at the arrival hall and I waited just outside when he went to get the taxi. It was a people carrier but there were grab rails to help me get in and out. Taxi drivers, both from and to the airport couldn't have been more helpful regarding parking and offering assistance. The journey to/ from airport by taxi took about 20 minutes.  The road parallel to the accommodation is a main road which has trams running along. I didn't use the tram while I was there so unable to comment, apart from I noticed that the new trams had wheelchair signs by one of the doors.  For me it was about a 20 - 30 minute walk to the Old Town, but I took a detour to view the castle. I came home by taxi, which I picked up from Krakow Station, which cost 30 Polish zloty, about £6. Please note that when I used street taxis they charged more than pre-booked and the drivers were always unhelpful, they just sat there and never offered help even when it was obvious I was struggling to get in/ get out. I would say please don't let this put you off going but just be aware of what to expect. The bathroom in the apartment worked for me. There was a shower which you needed to step over the runner of the shower door to get in, see photo. I brought my own non slip bath mat, but I found it quite hard to get it to stick to the tiles, as I couldn't bend over and stick it down, so I ended up with my flip flops on in the shower and that was fine for me. There was a regular toilet but it was between the washing machine worktop and the door so I had something to grab onto both sides to help me with my transfers. "
rose garden medical centre edinburgh,positive,"Blue Badge holders may park in the Centre's car park if required. Good accessible toilet. Grab rails, spotlessly clean and tidy. Not the largest of spaces if you have a larger power chair but functional."
rose street cafe edinburgh,positive,"For the non driver, the City has one of the most frequent and additional needs, access buses. All with extending platforms, drop down floors with wheelchair and mobility seating. With this being the Main Street in Edinburgh’s Ne Town, the are buses in either direction every 2 minutes, from this cafe 50m from the tram stop 300m. As with any old city parking is limited but there is blue badge, pay bay parking in nearby Charlotte Square. If you are visiting Edinburgh from elsewhere by car, drive to the nearest park and ride and if your Scottishand very a certain age your pass is free, there are a range of fares which are day savers an hour of parking charge equals a day saver, unlimited throughout the City for 24h."
roseburn path edinburgh,positive,"Permit or metered parking at the Roseburn end. Shoppers' car park at the Craigleith end.  Lothian buses 12, 26 & 31 will get you near to the Roseburn end of the walk, and there are plenty of buses from Craigleith shopping centre at the end of the walk. There are accessible toilets in several of the shops at Craigleith shopping centre."
rosedale railway path pickering,positive,"Drive from Castleton towards Hutton-in-the-Hole and a quarter mile beyond the Lion Inn is a car park on the left side with an information board. From Hutton you will need to spot the car park before you reach the Lion Inn, there is a very sharp left turn down into Farndale opposite the car park. From the car park, cross the road and down the Farndale turning for 20 yards and then right on to the old railway path which has flat access. You can negotiate a wheel chair around the side of a gate and then there are no other obstacles for miles! You can also explore bits of the railway path on the car park side of the road if you want a shorter trip."
roseisle by burghead,positive,"As a remote forest with is a bit off of the beaten track the best way to get here is by foot, cycle, horse or perhaps even a car. Public transport kit pretty scarce and the only way you'd get here is by taxi from one of the nearby villages. You leave the main road and follow the Forest signs that direct you down a long driveway bordered by fields until you enter the forest. Soon you are completely under the canopy of the tall pine trees as the single track tarmac road loops into to a clearing and the parking 'slots' beneath the trees. At the centre is a small wooden building where there is an information point and toilets. You find three or four accessible parking bays for Blue Badge holders just beyond the building. A pathway links the parking bays to the toilet block for easy access. For a timber cabin like building in the middle of a forest the accessible loo was just fine."
roseleaf edinburgh,negative,I travelled by bus - there are good bus links that come nearby so long as you don't mind a short walk over there. Didn't drive but it is on a reasonable quiet street A bit tricky getting the door open as opens towards you  and the opening space is quite narrow but it does open wide so a power chair  can get in. Roomy inside. One accessible loo available. Could be bigger. Plenty grab rails. Highchairs stored in loo take up a lot of room which will make some transfers difficult.
roseleaf edinburgh,positive,It's a cobbly part of leith so that can be tricky. But we managed to park right beside it. It's well served by buses. One disabled bay outside. Plenty on street parking nearby if you have a blue badge. Streets nearby are cobbled.
rosliston forestry centre overseal,negative,There is a bus route and a few parking spaces
ross band stand edinburgh,negative,Ours was okay but the other one was taken away mis concert and that side was mostly wheelchair users so not sure what they done.
ross bandstand edinburgh,positive,There is prebooked parking plus good train and bus links. Cordoned off disabled toilets at the platform.
rosslyn chapel slatebarns,positive,"Parking is available in the adjacent car park and it is possible for  disabled visitors to embark near the visitor centre and then park. The visitor centre has an accessible toilet. It is spacious, has modern fittings, and plenty of space to move around. One of the nicest accessible toilets I've seen for a long time. Easy short walk from car park to building. Disabled toilet at main entrance/cafe was very good, large and spacious. Easy access.  Easy parking with a short distance to the front door Easy to access and spotless"
rossmore leisure centre poole,negative,15 blue badge parking spaces but mainly taken by parents taking their kids to swimming and the management don't do anything about it.
rothay manor hotel restaurant ambleside,positive,The most disabled-friendly hotel I have stayed in since becoming disabled. Parked at door. Good.
rother valley country park sheffield,negative,"I'll be honest, the accessible toilet is better than no accessible toilet but it's inside the ladies/gents and isn't easy to get in. With an off-road chair, it's really difficult. Today I visited by motorhome and just used my own... but normally I leave my chair and dog with my hubby and hobble in alone."
rother valley country park sheffield,positive,"Not far off the M1 at J31. The road in is good and there is plenty of parking. As you arrive, your number plate is recorded. If you are a blue badge holder, you take it to the office and register it and then you can park for free. Everyone else should pay before leaving.   I visited with my motorhome today and parked in the coach park. It is flat and not far from the main car park.  Update: I returned the next day, with the same motorhome, having been told I only needed to register my blue badge once. When I left, the barrier didn't lift. I pressed the help button and he told me to use the next lane. I explained that I'm a huge motorhome and it didn't look big enough but he insisted. I persuaded the cars behind me to reverse and tried the next lane. I was too wide. I had to get out of the motorhome to get to the help button (without my wheelchair) and explain that I couldn't fit. He told me if I went back to the first lane, he would lift it manually as he could see that my blue badge was registered. By now there was a huge queue which all had to reverse again. Can't understand why this happened but I wasn't impressed and have dropped the parking score by one star. "
rothes halls glenrothes,positive,good parking at low cost  right next to bus station easy to get to clean  roomy easily accessed clearly signposted easy to lock/unlock
rothesay ferry terminal rothesay,positive,Great - we parked right outside the door! Not sure what public transport is like to get to the Ferry Terminal when on the island.
rothiemurchus forest aviemore,positive,"There is a car park for visitors with a member of staff at the gate. There is a charge, and the ranger gives you a handy map and leaflet about the area and places to explore. The carpark is very level if a little gravelly. The accessible parking spaces are right by the entrance to the trail."
roti chai london,positive,"Nearest tube station is Marble Arch or Bond Street (which is due to become step free). There are numerous buses that go along Oxford Street and Edgware Road, and are 2 - 3 minutes walk from the restaurant. The restaurant is on a side street between Selfridges and March Arch."
rotunda museum scarborough,negative,The best way to access the museum is by car as the station is about 20 mins walk which will be uphill on the way back.  Valley road that runs under valley bridge is the best place to park as it is a long road with free parking for disable badge holders within about 25 metres. There is then a wide and level path up to the museum. 
rotunda museum scarborough,positive,The loo is easily accessible to the right as you enter the building. The toilet is large and there is plenty of space for equipment and carer. There are grab rails and pull cord for emergencies. The loo was very clean.
roucan loch crematorium dumfries,positive,"You would require transport by car, as in a rural location 3 miles from town.  2 dedicated accessible parking spaces near entrance to main building, and one in front of the memorial lodge, which is a separate building. Plenty of parking "
rough castle fort falkirk,negative,"Bit bit of of the way, the car park from Falkirk Wheel is about a four minute walk, I think."
rouken glen garden centre linlithgow,positive,Parking right at the door
roundhay park leeds,positive,"There are a few disabled parking spaces outside tropical world, but also more parking on Park Lane and three other car parks. There are regular buses from and into town with regular bus stops. There is also a small train that goes around the park that you can use if you don't fancy walking the whole way around .  There is one set of toilets in the Lakeside cafe, with a good disabled toilet. The doors to the cafe are automatic and the toilets are clean and accessible. "
roundhouse london,positive,"There seem to be a number of disabled toilets, at least one on each floor. The toilet where a good size with all the rails that you would expect"
rousham house garden bicester,negative,Large car park.
route 38 saltash,positive,There are a number of disabled parking spaces just outside the restaurant close to the door.
rowlands pharmacy poole,negative,"There is local parking for this parade of shops, but there are no assigned disabled bays. Good luck!"
rowntree park reading cafe york,negative,"Accessible buses stop on Bishopthorpe Road opposite Southlands Methodist Church, a short distance from the Richardson Street Park entrance.  Disabled parking available at Rowntree Park car park and at Bishopthorpe Road car park, both roughly 300m from the cafe."
royal academy of arts london,negative,"There is just one sign posted disabled toilet on the  ground floor next to the gentleman's toilet. It is very busy with queues all day which can make access to the toilet itself very difficult. However, I asked a member of staff and they kindly took me through the Sir Hugh Casson cafe to the Keepers House which has a separate small lift which gave me access to a second disabled toilet on the lower ground floor with no queue. I have been to the RA of Art on at least 6 occasions and you just have to be prepared to queue or take my advice and visit the toilet in the Keepers House just 2 mins away"
royal academy of arts london,positive,"We drove disabled parking has to be pre booked. Don't know about London Underground nearest wheelchair one would be Green Park. Accessible, very good, rails, height, non slip floor etc. Good sized accessible loo on the ground floor. If you pre book  there are two disabled car parking spaces (call direct on access line)  which can be booked from 10 am to 2pm or 2pm to 6pm (require 7 days notice). Alternatively you can get a taxi. Avoid the tube if you are permanent wheelchair.as the nearest tube stations may have lifts but actually reaching the correct tube line is virtually impossible even post the 2012 Olympics. Try the bus instead. Green Park Station is very nearby and is fully step-free. But check before you travel: the lifts at this station are disgracefully unreliable and keep breaking down. TfL is unwilling to make proactive efforts to keep them in good working order. Many bus routes will drop you off right outside the Royal Academy. I don't know about parking. I'm delighted to report that there is a new suite of toilets (the old ones were awful, cramped, tiny, with long jumbled queues) and that the accessible toilet is perfectly configured and quite luxurious. Again: full marks!"
royal air force museum cosford shifnal,positive,Plenty of disabled parking spaces at the door Great toilets Clearly signposted
royal air force museum london,negative,"The carpark is spacious, but there are no concessions for Blue Badge holders, and the venue is too far away from the roads for yellow line parking to be possible. Although the venue is vast, the single 'accessible' toilet was only designed to meet the legal minimum standard and then fails because of the way it has been fitted out. The sliding door does not open the entire width of the doorway, while the side transfer space is impossible to use because a baby change table and grab rails juts into it. There is no first aid room that can be used as a changing space."
royal air force museum london,positive,Plenty of disabled parking spaces in the car park at the front of the museum. All on the flat. A charge is made for car parking (£4 for 6 hours so quite reasonable) but entrance to the museum itself is then Free! Disabled toilets are situated in all three of the main halls and are well signposted.
royal air force museum london london,negative,Public transport to nearby leaves something to be desired with the exception of the 303 bus. Recently the roads and pavements around the museum seem to have been re-tarmaced meaning it's quite a smooth journey although bit of a detour for a dropped kerb to start.
royal air force museum london london,positive,One of the accessible toilets in the big hanger has a sliding door and isn't the best for manoeuvring otherwise no issues. All toilets seemed clean with inspection sheets showing checks of the facility.  The Changing Places (no key required!) was well hidden and entry via a manual door but very easy to open and close and was immaculate. Not sure maybe if the bins could be better placed?
royal albert hall london,positive,"Parking Right outside the building by an arrangement Very large and easy to manoeuvre around toilets with all necessary adjustments I only encountered one disabled toilet but it was very large and had all the expected rails et cetera. I have attached a photo If you book early, they will reserve a parking space for you right outside the accessible entrance. It's perfect - I can't fault it. This is one of the biggest toilets: its clean, I remember it having a hoist (although I've never used it). It's operated by radar key which, depending on your perspective, may or may not be a plus. I have never had any difficulty using it. The toilets are very spacious to allow for a wheelchair to get in and still hacve enough space to do everything you need to do.  The alarm cable is in easy reach and there are plenty of them around the building."
royal armouries museum leeds,negative,"There are only 5 disabled parking spaces, opposite the hotel next to the venue. Did not take public transport but it is close to the city centre. "
royal armouries museum leeds,positive,"brilliant for private car.......not sure about public transport fine for me..but not changing places There was an accessible toilet on every floor, but we couldn't find the one on the ground floor. There are signs and the toilets were clean and well equipped.  Five Disabled bays by the entrance about 50metres away. Plus a carpark near by. Very good. We travelled by car to the Royal Armouries. The car park was a designated multi-storey car park for the Royal Armouries, this car park did have disabled parking spaces.  The parking was stress free and defiantly cost effective however the multi-storey car park was a walk away from the front of the museum.  There is public transport available to people who wish to go to the Royal Armouries however again, this would mean they would have to walk from the main roads towards the back of the river and into the museum.  Lots of accessible toilets spread out across various floors of the building  Good disabled parking as close to the venue as possible. good facilities, a bit cramped if a carer is needed. Clean"
royal artillery cottage   culzean castle maybole,positive,There is a good sized accessible toilet in the cottage. There are adequate accessible toilets throughout the grounds particularly at the visitors centre and the swan lake and in the castle itself.
royal athenaeum suites aberdeen,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. The Royal Athenaeum is close to Aberdeen Station, though the connecting streets (Market Street or Shiprow) are both marked as steep on Aberdeen City Council's accessibility map, and would be very challenging for a self-propelling wheelchair user. The Royal Athenaeum is on Union Street and there are bus stops close by, served by FirstBus. Aberdeen buses have helpful drivers, manual ramps and wheelchair spaces. Spacious, equipped with a wheelchair-accessible washbasin, wheelchair-accessible loo (side transfer from one side possible), both with good grab rails. The wet room shower is easy to operate, but has no grab rails near it. A movable stool is provided, but this was too low to be safely used in the absence of grab rails. A good bathroom and could be outstanding given a fixed fold-down seat by the shower and sensibly positioned grab rails so that a user who can get out of the wheelchair can move safely into the shower. This wheelchair user needed the accompanist's help. Also, see  below."
royal bank of scotland coatbridge,negative,Because of its location there is no parking outside the bank the nearest parking is with in the Asda car park then via the access ramp to the pedestrian area. There is also some Blue badge parking available on the Main St however this does fill up very quickly during the day. It is also about 150 meters from the store.  There is no toilet in the bank however there is a wheelchair accessible toilet located in the Asda sore across from the bank  
royal bank of scotland edinburgh,positive,"There is disabled parking outside the Branch and space to drop off in safety.   The tram stops outside the Branch, Waverley Station is very close as is the bus station. There is disabled parking directly outside the Bank and since it is in its own grounds easy to drop off   Access is on the level.   The tram stops outside the Bank, Waverley Station is very close as is St. Andrews Bus Station Ample parking, mixture of pay bays, disabled access bays, Bus Services, 11, 15, 16, 23, 36 and 45 stop with 15m northbound and 30m southbound. There is disabled parking outside the front door, the tram stop is opposite and Waverley station and the Bus Station are very close.  "
royal bank of scotland glasgow,positive,Got parked in a disabled spot right across the road
royal botanic garden edinburgh,negative,"There are disabled access toilets which are clean and well maintained. There is not a CP toilet yet. I would hope this will change in the near future to allow the Botanics to be a fully inclusive and accessible place able to be enjoyed by all.  The gardens are in a bus route (East Gate) and there is on street parking (West Gate), but the council have bollarded off what was the disabled parking so I'm not sure how good that is now The main toilets near the greenhouses are available for a whole family, locking yourselves at the main door. Accessible toilet is available as usual with its own queuing system."
royal botanic garden edinburgh,positive,"The bus stop by the East Gate is really handy as there's only a short walk to the entrance. If you come by car then the West Gate, John Hope Gateway, is probably better as there are some accessible parking bays but these do get busy. Very good toilets with a choice of three different places that I saw. The accessible loos in the John Hope Gateway are my favourite - particularly the larger of the two. Plenty of space to manoeuvre.  Ample disabled parking at the main entrance  We parked and the directions for where to park (and where not to) on the tickets were very clear. There was also very good information on taxi drop off points and disabled parking.  There is Blue Badge parking near the West Gate of the gardens. There is also metered parking on the surrounding streets which can be used for free by Blue Badge holders. There are also several bus stops nearby. No dedicated parking but on street parking is available at the John Hope Gateway. It can be very busy at times. Three locations have accessible toilets. One at the John Hope Gateway - modern but tight for larger wheelchairs. Another adjacent to the glasshouses - more space to manoeuvre. A third at the East Gate - modern and very spacious - room for p.a. / carer if required. All entrance ways are flat and wheelchair friendly. There are designated parking spaced outside the main entrance way.  We use the number 27 public bus to get to the East gate, it is a straight forward 5 minute walk from the stop on a well maintained pavement.  Paths and walkways around the gardens are flat, wide and smooth ensuring movement around is easy. There are some hills in the gardens such as to the main café but there are alternative routes in as well.  Disabled spaces out the front of the entrance and also plenty of on street parking. There are accessible toilets throughout the botanic's Fully accessible toilets in both the main building and the Terrace cafe. I particularly like the downstairs toilet in the main building because it has a concertina door. No struggling to open or close the door! Several accessible loos spotted. The one at the East Gate was fine with clear signage, level access and plenty of space to manoeuvre - really large loo at the John Hope building with enough room for carers as well. By car, disabled bays outside the entrance which are free, plenty of large parking space on the street with meters. I would imagine public transport would be good, its just off the city centre. Disabled parking is available by the West Gate and the John Hope Gateway. Accessible buses pass by the East Gate. I tried the accessible loo in the John Hope Gateway. It was spacious, clean and large enough for my fairly large powerchair. Another accessible is by the East Gate Cafe. This one required going through two doors to access; which other visitors held open.  Very spacious and room for a carer. You can easily arrive by bus to the East Gate as there are buses outside the gate. Parking is available out side the West Gate, the John Hope Gateway. Plenty of accessible toilets throughout the gardens. All clean, spacious and well appointed. A particularly large accessible loo is available in the John Hope Gateway if you need space for PAs / carers. I'm not sure about parking or buses as I arrived by scooter and left by taxi. Great. I've never encountered the bi-fold door they had but it was light weight and easy. Suitable rails and red cord. Was dropped off outside main John Hope gate and is a short walk to mean reception. Parking by the John Hope Gateway in the accessible spaces was fine. However, this may get quite busy at times. Friends arrived by bus which handily stopped at the East Gate. There were several accessible toilets in the gardens. One in particular stood out, at the John Hope Gateway, as it wa super large and well equipped. The others were good but with not quite so much space.  On public road, limited spaces at the door but lots of in street parking if you have blue badge and some means of mobilising. I had reason to give feedback on last visit as red emergency cord was tied up. Went this week and there is a very prominent notice attached to it instructing people not to tie or wrap around rail. The first time this has happened in my years of complaining about red cords."
royal british legion scotland forres,negative,you can park within easy walking of the venue also a carpark near by
royal british legion scotland forres,positive,"easily asccessable plenty room for a wheelchair and carer,hand rails in place,clean and tidy."
royal caribbean international cruises southampton,positive,"Can leave wheelchair adapted vehicle opposite dock terminal opposite doors in secure compound No changing places toilets at the dock but on board ship you have wheelchair accessible rooms and bathrooms Car to Southampton then Transmobility specialist taxi company.  It can be cheaper to have an overnight in Southampton where some hotels of free or low cost parking plus shuttle tonand from ship.  All accessible. No red cord system, an alert button. "
royal carlton hotel blackpool,negative,There is no parking  front of this hotel however there is some available in the side streets however this will be very busy during the busy periods such as Summer and the Illuminations.  The St Chads Tram Stop is just across the road and a number of local buses use the bus stop that is just along the road from the hotel. There is one wheelchair accessible toilet available in the bar area it is located in the corner as you go past the bar. The light comes on automatically as you enter. There are grab rails to both sides and room for a care giver to help if required.    The Red cords were tied up however when I spoke to the manager he told me that they do untie them but find that members of the public tie them up for some reason or another.
royal china sandown,positive,"on the main Sandown High Street 2 minutes from the beach Served by several buses, approx half hourly - 5 mins walk from bus stop On street parking Several disabled parking bays outside the restaurant Accessible toilet on restaurant level (main toilets are downstairs) "
royal college of physicians london,positive,"I travelled on public transport. The nearest tube is Great Portland Street which is not an accessible station, as it has only stairs between platform and street level. Nearest step free tubes are King's Cross and Paddington, from which you can get a bus. From the bus stop it's about a 5 minute walk.  The website says there's free, pre-bookable car parking for visitors with a disability.  The toilets are on the lower ground floor accessible by lift. There were 2 accessible toilets. One was a changing room with changing mat and shower. The other was a regular sized accessible toilet. Both had grab rails and red cords. However the red cord in the changing room toilet was short."
royal commonwealth pool edinburgh,negative,The disabled parking is very good here.
royal commonwealth pool edinburgh,positive,"There's a fairly large car park near to the front door. Several bays are dedicated for use by disabled people. If arriving by bus there are bus stops within 200m of the entrance. I did find when arriving, by bus, that the accessible route to the entrance was not clear. A signpost would help. You head off to the left as you face the building and you'll find an opening with a sloped path up to the doors. The accessible toilets were very good with plenty of space and room for a carer. Grab rails, alarm, clean and free of obstructions. There are two accessible loos adjacent to the cafe on the left hand side. Another is toward the back of the pools past the wheelchair viewing platform. Loos were sizable and doubled as baby change areas. Red cords were tied up when visited and did not reach the ground. I parked in the accessible bays with the car park of the centre. I counted at least 6 wheelchair accessible spaces, and there are also parent and child spaces available too.  There were lots of accessible toilets dotted throughout the centre, which was fantastic. The accessible changing room also had a shower bed, which would allow people who require support to lay down while showering, which was a great feature. I drove and used the car park. There are 6 disabled spaces. Sometimes the spaces are full so I have to park further away around the back. Sometimes people who don’t have a blue badge park in the spaces.  There is a bus stop right outside the venue. The toilets are easy to find. They are a reasonable size. There is enough space to turn. There is enough space for my career to come it too. Plenty of accessible parking next to the main entrance and a good bus service that stops almost at the door. There are a good amount of accessible toilets everywhere you are at the venue. They are a good size and a particularly big space in the accessible changing area beside the smaller pool. This toilet has ceiling track hoist and changing bed. "
royal concert hall nottingham,positive,We drove in our car. The website details where the on road blue badge parking is and it is quite close to venue. Not lots of blue badges spaces but we got parked easily. 
royal conservatoire of scotland glasgow,positive,Parking can be arranged on site for people with limited mobility; simply get in touch to discuss your requirements. Public transport operates nearby and it's easy to get into the building from street level. I visited a couple of the accessible toilets and these were modern and fairly spacious.
royal courts of justice london,positive,"The nearest step free tube would be King's Cross or Green Park, or some of the tube lines from Waterloo. There are many buses that stop very close by. I found the accessible toilets on the first floor. They were entered via a communal door which was wooden and quite heavy and difficult to open. The accessible toilet cubicle had grab rails and an emergency alarm. It was clean and spacious."
royal delft delft,positive,"Accessible parking is available in front of the site for free at selected spots.  The city of Delft is approximately an hour commute from Amsterdam Central station.  To get there, you can take your private vehicle, taxi, or arrive to the city center by train and .  Contact Accessible Travel Netherlands for more assistance with planning your journey.   The Delft pottery experience is located a short drive, or a 17-20 minute walk outside the city center. There is also an accessible toilet at the beginning of the tour."
royal derby hospital derby,positive,"Nearest car park is number 2. This car park is usually full.   Nearest bus stop is stop B (Royal Derby Trent Barton) which has  shelter with seating.  Nearest car park is number 2. This car park is usually full.   Nearest bus stop is stop B (Royal Derby Trent Barton) which has  shelter with seating.  Royal One (Trent Barton) bus runs around the hospital which leaves from The Spot in Derby, it doesn't run from the bus station. The Mickleover bus (Trent Barton) runs from bus station but it stops outside the hospital (to get back into Derby on this bus you have to cross the main road which has traffic lights and is quite a walk.   There is parking but it is often very busy and full. Website says they have one dedicated disabled car park (car park 3) with 64 bays (these bays are not free). Free parking is available for up to 3 hours at entrance 21, 24 and outside children's hospital. If you can't use the barriers you have to get special permit from car park office in advance.   Disabled loos are located all around the hospital in various departments. All the loos are different but have basic facilities including grab rails around toilet and sink. All the loos I've been in have been clean. In some departments sign on door says if toilet is left or right transfer.   No evidence of a changing place toilet at this hospital.   The toilet in photos is the toilet is the main reception. Closest entrance for Medical Outpatients is the Main Entrance and Bus Stop A. Nearest car park is 8 but it is usually full. They recomend giving yourself an hour to park.  The accessible toilet had enough space to turn and to have a carer assist you. The grab rails were blue and around the toilet and sink. The toilet was left hand transfer but it may be awkward as they've put the emergency cord in the way. There was a lowered coat hook. Toilet sign was in pictures not words. "
royal derngate northampton,positive,Park at the front of the venue and go straight in to the foyer
royal george hotel perth,negative,"There are two disabled spaces right outside on the main street, but on busy days eg Saturdays it is unlikely that these will be free as the hotel is right in the main shopping area."
royal george hotel perth,positive,Good large toilet with rails etc
royal highland centre newbridge,positive,I got public transport to the centre - Lothian Buses have diverted some of their usual airport routes and they stop right outside. There’s also the option of the tram if you’re able to walk about 15 mins from the nearest stop. Plus there were big signs for car parking nearby. The normal size. I have not seen a changing room there. 
royal horse royal leamington spa,positive,3 Disabled spaces right outside front entrance. Access from street down a gentle slope from roadside footpath.
royal hotel elgin,positive,Disabled car parking is directly opposite the hotel. 
royal lyceum theatre edinburgh,negative,There are limited disabled parking bays opposite the theatre and spaces in the adjacent streets - both accessible through blue badge. Parking will be tricky due to Usher Hall traffic. In review
royal lyceum theatre edinburgh,positive,"Located at street level and close to the lift so easy to reach in the interval. Smallish but usable. We travelled by rail to Haymarket and then a 15min walk to the Theatre. Be sure to cross onto the left hand side of Morrison Street as the drop down kerbs are a bit dodgy further up on the right hand side. I did spot blue badge parking spaces directly opposite the entrance.  There are two accessible toilets on the ground floor. I didn’t see one in the stalls area. The one I used on the ground floor directly opposite the lift was very spacious. It included a changing area for babies which often cuts the space but not in this instance I could manoeuvre my large chair around with ease. Transfers onto the toilet would be either front on of from the left out of your wheelchair. All the usual grab rails you would expect.  I don't drive but I did.notice there were some accessible parking bays right outside the front door. I arrived on the bus that stopped just by the Usher Hall so it was fairly easy to walk across to the Lyceum.  The toilets were fine for me and easy to find. I know there was an accessible toilet but I didn't use it. Very good sized loo, able to turn my large outdoor power chair with ease. "
royal mackintosh hotel dunbar,positive,"The hotel has its own small car park plus ample car parking in the nearby streets and Railway Station, 2 mins from the Hotel, there is a 30 min butservice from Edinburgh, with a concession bus pass this makes all the difference and can help make it a real adventure, there other services from Berwick, Haddington, North Berwick as well as Edinburgh. The bus stops are outside the Hotel on either side of the street east and west bound. All on the one level and fully accessible."
royal mail group plc coatbridge,negative,There is a Blue badge space located next to the door you go in and for the size of the office is fine. There is a step up from the Car Park on to the pavement area that might be high for some people.
royal mile sweets edinburgh,negative,Limited parking on the Royal Mile.
royal military tattoo at edinburgh castle edinburgh,negative,"See body of review.  We caught a bus, then walked.  It wasn't a long walk, but difficult terrain, especially in the tightly packed crowds.    We left just before the end in order to get downhill and avoid said crowds, thus making the walking easier for me. I was unimpressed by the one I went to - but at least there were disabled toilets"
royal military tattoo at edinburgh castle edinburgh,positive,"We parked in St Giles Street and were filed into a convoy by Stewards, we were parked there for around 30 mins and there was a café in the street. we were escorted in convoy up the royal mile and on to the castle esplanade where the buses were parked in rows, once all the buses were parked we were greeted by a senior steward and once we were all off the bus, we were escorted as a group 50 yards across the concourse and down a small incline under the grandstand another 25 yards up a small incline to the bottom of the Ramp which was steep but manageable and then another 20 feet to our seats which was amazing. I was in a wheelchair and had reason to visit the toilets which for a public loo were spacious enough for a wheelchair and carer and were very clean and tidy. the toilets were easily found and were fitted with grabrails. "
royal observatory london,negative,Cutty Sark Station is on the DLR and is fully accessible (check beforehand whether the lift is working by using the Updownlondon website or app). It's quite a long uphill walk to the Royal Observatory. There's a decent accessible toilet but some thoughtless or unkind person had tied up the red emergency cord around one of the grabrails so that it was out of reach of anyone who might fall to the floor. Most annoying. See the picture below. Accessible toilet but small and not particularly clean. 
royal observatory london,positive,"Parking place outside if you drove and that area was flat. If you come by public transport it's a steep walk up the hill - best if you come through Greenwich Village through the shops, not from the Naval College. "
royal pump rooms royal leamington spa,positive,"6 Blue Badge parking bays outside museum and a flat walking area to inside.   Automatic entrance door.  Train Station too far to walk.  Regular buses. Easy to find accessable,large loo.  Plenty of grab rails."
royal shakespeare theatre stratford upon avon,negative,There are disabled parking spaces available outside the theatre and around Stratford town in nearby streets. However Stratford is always busy so these are often full. There is ample parking in nearby car parks. There are clearly signed accessible toilets. They are of a good size for manoeuvring a wheelchair and we have always found them to be clean. The ground floor accessible loo is in a rather busy spot just inside the main foyer and you need to be careful when opening the door not to bump into someone. It is also a busy spot to wait if the loo is in use. Nothing on site but public on-street but a number of blue badge parking on roads outside. Park & Ride available for the town. Accessible local buses. Check www.stratford.gov.uk 
royal shakespeare theatre stratford upon avon,positive,"Good disabled street parking immediately outside theatre and alongside the Courtyard Theatre. Occasionally full , but more parking on side streets. roomy and with good disabled friendly locks which don't challenge my weak hands when on my own! Easy positioning to get in and out, except in roof top restaurant where turning in an out of is is a little tight. I didn't use them, but they told me that there were dedicated parking bays very near to the theatre Accessible toilets on all floors with alternate sides for transferring."
royal star beach resort hurghada,negative,My flights from Birmingham to Hurghada and back were with TUI.  Difficulty getting in and out of my seat was an issue.  Co-op Travel booked us a mini-bus transfer.
royal star beach resort hurghada,positive,"Kept pretty clean and the toilet itself is reasonably high.  A wheelchair could just about fit in the space available but it would be tight.  Additionally, the pull-down rail is in front of rather than at the side of the toilet. "
royal station hotel newcastle upon tyne,positive,"The hotel is a kind of gigantic annex to Newcastle Central Station. This station is fully step-free, and ramp assistance is available for train services arriving and departing. In addition there is the Central Station Metro stop, which - like the rest of the Metro system - is fully step-free, and several buses stop right outside. I don't know anything about parking in the area."
royal troon golf club troon,positive,Large car park with disabled bays. Easy to use. Plenty of room.
royal vauxhall tavern london,negative,"Small, narrow and pretty accessible."
royal west of england academy bristol,negative,"I walked to the gallery, but I do recall seeing a bus stop fairly close to it. This area didn't look like it had a lot of parking, but they may have some parking for disabled visitors at the front of the building. No carpark - parking is difficult on the street (permit holders only, mostly). There is an accessible parking space on the forecourt that needs pre booking. There are local bus services that stop further along the road. Taxis can pull onto the forecourt for drop-offs. Nearest car parks are a little way off.  "
royal west of england academy bristol,positive,"Roomy & clean with grabrails and red cord. Tap in sink dripping.  Bright coloured toilet seat good for people with dementia. RWA is going to have a Changing Places toilet installed as part of the building project to improve access, so this will be available when it reopens in spring 2022.  "
rozelle estate ayr,negative,There is a few disabled parking spaces by the rugby pitches and which are near the entrance to woodland paths. The car park has a lot of potholes and it is rather gravely.  Unfortunately the toilets weren't open.  
rr country melton mowbray,positive,Drove there and good size car park 
rspb arne wareham,positive,"You can pick up the Tramper in the main car park. However, if you can walk a little and don't need the Tramper, you can park further into the reserve in the Blue Badge Car Park and start from there."
rspb conwy nature reserve conwy,positive,"Brown RSPB signage off A55 and at roundabout make it easy to find by road and Llandudno Junction railway station is half a mile away. Clea, roomy accessible loo There are 8 Blue badge parking spaces next to the visitor centre There is a spacious accessible toilet inside the coffee shop, other ladies and gents are on the outside of the building. Drove. Loads of level parking. Several disabled bays by main entrance."
rspb dearne valley old moor barnsley,negative,The disabled parking is several hundred yards from the centre
rspb dearne valley old moor barnsley,positive,Well signposted loo with wide door and hand rails
rspb loch garten osprey centre boat of garten,positive,didn't use them
rspb lochwinnoch lochwinnoch,negative,The accessible toilet is outside the visitors centre. It is tiny! I'm not sure that I could have assisted my son to use the facilities due to lack of space and it was very much like an outdoor shed.
rspb lochwinnoch lochwinnoch,positive,3 blue badge spaces but car park is gravel so not ideal for wheelchair
rspb old moor barnsley,positive,Blue badge parking close to the Centre (about 50 yards). You could drop off even closer. Two disabled loos beside the shop.
rspb saltholme stockton on tees,positive,Good car parking. Staff drove a mobility scooter out to the car park to me. There is no charge for scooter or chairs but you are invited to make a donation. Again access to disabled loo was awkward for the large scooter but the facilities were exellent.
rspb scotland loch leven kinross,positive,Only slight difficulty was the  small cobbled courtyard that you need to cross from the car parking area. Good sized disabled toilet on ground level.
rspca derby derby,positive,Abbey Street car park is outside (no free parking). It is about 0.6 miles walk from Derby bus station and 1.1 mile from Derby train station.
rubber soul liverpool,negative,In the Cavern Quarter no car parking and public transport 5-10 mins walk
rufford abbey country park rufford abbey,positive,Limited number of disabled bays but plenty of space if you choose your time to visit parking should not be a problem. Everything you could possibly need. One has a folding door which I found rather tricky but that is my only and slight negative.
rugby park kilmarnock,negative,Toilets were ok. Issue though had to be a large black bin in there making it difficult to move about
rugby railway station rugby,negative,"There are numerous spaces for disabled parking however these are situated at the back of the station, across a busy main road. While tickets can be bought from either the front or back entrances to the station, barriers are in place at each entrance. Parking charges also amount to £9.00 for a day ticket.  There are good bus links to the town centre outside the station, as well as buses to Coventry and Daventry."
runnymede on thames hotel egham,positive,Free parking and just off main road for public transport.
russell cotes art gallery and museum bournemouth,negative,No parking at the venue. Public car parks up and down slopes needing a good wheelchair pusher. If you use a mobility scooter from the car park remember that you can’t use it inside the museum. Bus routes stop nearby (near Royal Bath Hotel) but again steep approach to the museum. You’d need to take a taxi from the railway station.
russell cotes art gallery and museum bournemouth,positive,Good accessible loo but within paid area. Clear red cord by positioned where it might easily be pulled by mistake when rising from the loo. Plenty of space for wheelchair and carer.
rustic stone dublin,positive,Downstairs accessible bathroom with grab rails
rutland sailability oakham,positive,"There is disabled parking right by the bridge that is an accessible route into the café. 5 spaces.  Three disabled loos with three disabled showers. No pull cords, though: stipulation of being supervised."
ryde beach ryde,negative,"The closest accessible toilets are to the east just past the children's sandy playground. The nearest Changing Room unfortunately is in Newport (8 + miles away). If you're trying to find accessible public toilets I recommend the 'Flush' app, it's saved me several times!"
ryde beach ryde,positive,"Lots of parking, free to blue badge holders."
ryde superbowl ryde,positive,"Next to Ryde bus station, next to the hovercraft from Southsea (10 mins journey, the hovercraft itself is wheelchair accessible). Near to Island Line train station. Large public car park, half a dozen of blue badge parking bays, regularly patrolled by traffic wardens and disabled bays are very rarely abused.  Blue badge holders park free  "
ryman stationary richmond,positive,"Several bus routes pass this shop, and Richmond Station is nearby, fully step-free."
ryman stationery london,negative,"The nearest tube station is Sloane Square, which is not step-free, but does have escalators from the westbound (but NOT the eastbound) platform to street level, so if you can get out of your wheelchair and take it up an escalator, this station may be an option. Loads of buses go along the King's Road. I wouldn't attempt to park nearby."
ryman stationery london,positive,"Green Park station is 0.8 miles away and fully step free, but check before you travel, the lifts at this station are notoriously and disgracefully unreliable.   Tottenham Court Road station is much closer, and fully step-free (contact staff at the ticket barrier if you want to travel on the Central Line as they have to deploy a ramp manually), but check before you travel, the lifts at this station are notoriously and disgracefully unreliable.   Many buses serve nearby Oxford Street.  I don't know about parking in Soho."
rynek glowny krakow,positive,"Rynek Glowny is about a 10 minute walk from Krakow's main railway station. There are several trams which stop close by. I didn't use the trams when I was in Krakow, but I saw plenty of them and they all appeared modern and had a wheelchair sign by one of the doors. The main square is pedestrianised but taxis are plentiful and could stop nearby. "
ryze glasgow,positive,"Sign could be clearer No accessible Parking. Lots of Space but very busy. Might be difficult to find a space. Disabled toilet at front door. Door could benefit from wheelchair sign, but clean and accessible. Walkied. Busy parking area. Clean, accessible. Could be signed clearer, picture signs could help."
s luca edinburgh,positive,"Busy street, ample parking excellent bus service service with routes 11, 15, 16, 23, 36 and 45 stops within 50m on each side of the road. Fully appointed, clean and well serviced toilets given the popularity, ample room for wheelchair and carer. Easy to find"
sadlers wells theatre london,positive,"The nearest tube station is not accessible for a wheelchair so I travelled by taxi on my first visit and returned by bus. On my second visit I travelled by bus which is very convenient, free and more comfortable. There are direct and frequent buses from both Victoria and Waterloo mainline stations. From Victoria - 35 minutes and Waterloo - 15/20 minutes. There are very few dropped kerbs outside venue so tricky for a power chair user to cross the road for the return bus journey. Well located, spacious and very clean accessible toilet on the ground floor. It has an automatic sliding door and it looks very new as the toilet and hand dryer are also automatic. There is a red cord which reaches to ground level. (see photos)  The toilet on the first floor is also very good. Both have plenty of space for a manual or power chair. Free small car park. Book a space when you book your ticket. Two blue badge spaces on the road outside. No under cover parking. If you book in advance they have a secure car park with spaces for blue badge holders or people on their access list. There is no charge for this. It's approx 25yds from the front door, less on the way out as they open a side door. I managed to book a space on a busy Friday night, same day, and needed to collect the parking voucher from the box office. Excellent facility. In addition to the fully accessible loos, there were also several cubicles with outward opening doors and handrails. I rate this very highly, as there are many people who find this helpful, without needing to occupy a fully accessible loo."
safari adventure golf dawlish,positive,"The golf course is across the road from Dawlish train station. The station has step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. There are also step free, local buses that stop opposite the golf course."
safehands at the new mayfair blackpool,positive,They can pick you up from where you live and take you back home where ever you live The parking is at the back of the hotel but you can park at the front as well All the toilets are accesible
sage gateshead gateshead,positive,"Good disabled parking facilities Easy to find and spacious. Well equipped. There is a big car park at the venue which is not fully accessible to a disabled person but there is parking for Disabled with level access at the main door. There is a bus service from Newcastle City to the Sage and plenty of taxis are available.  We used a taxi which took us straight to the door. There are accessible loos on all floors and they are easy to find. BUT be aware ! The signs show ladies and gentlemen's toilets and also  show a disabled access sign,  but as my wife is my carer and I need her to help me all the time the ""gents"" was not  for me!  However there are disabled loos which are ""free standing"" and no  problems!  They  were both very clean and plenty of room to manoeuvre. A big plus was they had HOT Water too.  Grab bars were well placed but there was no Changing Places toilet. Walked here, big car park out at front - with plenty of accessible spaces. Great, clean and large toilets."
sagrada familia barcelona,negative,"There is no parking near this attraction. I would not advise trying to access this attraction via car because of this and the large amounts of traffic congestion on the surrounding roads.   There is a metro station directly outside the cathedral with lift access to enter and exit the metro station, there is also lift access to the different stations within and the metro carriages are all level access. I noted several wheelchair users- both powered and self propelled using the metro on my visit. There is also dropped kerb access outside the cathedral. It is worth noting however that the Sagrada is on one of the busiest metro lines in the city and it gets extremely crowded on the carriages. Several of the Barcelona tourist buses stop outside the cathedral which have wheelchair ramps for access.   Taxis are in abundance in Barcelona, so if you are able to transfer in and out of a car this would also be a good way of accessing the cathedral. There are wheelchair taxi firms which require booking in advance. "
sagrada familia barcelona,positive,"I don't know about the parking, but on my visit, Barcelona's public transport system triumphed again. I took a wheelchair-accessible bus to get there, and an accessible metro train to get back to my hotel. I didn't have high expectations of the loos in such a busy place, but I was pleasantly surprised. As I approached, there was a queue for the ladies' toilets right out the door, but a steward sprang forward, ushered me and my scooter past the line of waiting people and unlocked the door to my very own large, clean accessible loo. Just one downside: the light inside was on an energy-saving motion sensor and kept deciding to turn itself off because my movement wasn't lively enough to let it know I was still there. "
sainsbury centre for visual arts norwich,positive,"2 disabled parking bays next to front door- fantastic. Great as long as you aren't the third disabled visitor, but there appeared to be some more parking not too far away (not sure of any of these were disabled width though, you might need to ring and check). We found parking quite easy, I would have thought though that on busy days there would not be enough disabled parking for everyone. Excellent. I got dropped off by a taxi in one of the bays right in front of the building."
sainsburys blackpool,positive,Bang opposite the station and next to the bus stops so we were very happy. The bus stop we came in on was one of the accessible style where the pavement was raised so no having to deploy ramps which was a bonus! Accessible toilets in store which was good.
sainsburys edinburgh,negative,"Underground car park. Good number of disabled spaces for cars near to entrance, but access for buses is poor as they cannot get under the height restriction.  Pedestrian walkways through the car park are not very clear for cars driving up and down. Ramped access to bus stop right outside shop, however, no road crossing right by shop to get to opposite bus stop. Basic accessible toilets at the back of the store (next to soft drink aisle). I feel these were poorly signposted and hard to find. No Changing Places."
sainsburys edinburgh,positive,"There's ample car parking with disabled spaces (not that we used them) and the Craigleith retail park is served by Lothian buses 38 (West Granton to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and vice versa but not on Saturdays or Sundays) and 42 (Davidson's Mains to King's Road and vice versa) which stop just outside Sainsburys. You can also get to Craigleith along the network of cycle and footpaths on former railway lines - see our review of the Roseburn Path. There are three well-equipped and spacious accessible loos - one on store level and two upstairs on the café level. All had alarm cords at floor level. The music is very loud in the upstairs disabled loos, and won't be to everyone's taste. Good, one disabled toilet for the store, wide entrance, although toilet up against the wall. Disabled parking bays were fairly close to the front door. There is an accessible toilet at the far end of the store. It's large and clean. Bus stop is right outside and there is a large under cover car park to the shop. Great. There are lots of accessible parking bays close to the entrance of the shop. These are clearly marked and you can then follow clear paths and crossings to the store entrance. There are also regular buses on the main road outside Meadowbank Centre. These are Lothian buses and are wheelchair accessible. There are lots of blue badge parking bays under a shelter and close to the entrance where you then go up in a lift/travellator to main shop floor. Lothian buses 20, 34 and 36 stop outside. When coming from public transport on Longstone road take care when going down the ramp to the bottom entrance when it rains."
sainsburys glasgow,positive,Extensive accessible parking available close to store front Easy to find well sign posted all rails fitted clean and tidy good color contrast
sainsburys kirkcaldy,positive,It's on the bus route and there is a disabled parking space at the front of the store but it is busy during rush hour. The door frame around the entrance is too small but the toilet is accessible with rails.
sainsburys lincoln,negative,Blue badge is a must have plenty of spaces Blue badge needed
sainsburys lincoln,positive,Toilets are excellent Toilets are good well sited good size well laid out
sainsburys london,positive,Plenty of parking near covered walkway
sainsburys ponteland,positive,Disabled spaces are right outside the door
sainsburys stirling,positive,Parking is excellent with lots of disabled bays.
sainsburys york,negative,"There is a small parking bay directly opposite the store.  There is no dedicated parking to the store.  The parking bay is next to a curbed foot path, there is no room to leave the road side door open for long as it would obstruct oncoming cars.  "
sainsburys york,positive,"At the time of the visit, red cord tied up in one of the disabled loos and the downstairs disabled loo was the only one in use to all customers."
saint cecilias hall edinburgh,positive,"It is in the city centre so well catered for by public transport. Nearest train station is Waverley, there are also buses.   I didn't drive there, and it doesn't have its own car park. Disabled parking spaces can be found in the surrounding streets.  The bathroom looked clean and had a modern finish. The emergency cord was hanging and already had a Euans Guide card on it. "
saint ives town centre saint ives,negative,"Parking in St Ives is over three car parks. The top car park on the way by the hospital was very large with several disabled spaces, but was a 15 minute walk into the town and all the way up hill on the return journey, which was too much for the man with wheels. We parked in the car park up from the Tate gallery. This only had two blue badge spaces and had the only disabled toilet in the whole of the town centre. The other car park was Sloop hill but despite having 6 spaces for blue badges, they were always taken. One day we ended up parking on the yellow lines outside the Tate for the three hour limit we are allowed with the badge. Its a get up early job!  The streets of St Ives are narrow and if you have a big car or van it is a tight squeeze. Sloop hill is on an incredibly sharp turn! Also blue badge holders have to pay for parking so bring change. We do get an extra hour compared to normal drivers.  Cornwall council has a scheme where if you pay £10 in advance you can park anywhere in Cornwall for free and it lasts all year. If your car like ours has been adapted you can register for free, but you must have the V5 number available. All this has to be done in advance, as it all goes on your number plate and I watched someone get a ticket who had obviously not registered and not brought a ticket! Details can be found here:  https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/health-and-social-care/physical-disabilities/blue-badge-disabled-parking-permits/ We only found one disabled loo and that was in the Tate car park and that needed a RADAR key to enter."
saint lukes the winged ox glasgow,positive,"This venue is centrally located and so parking facilities are limited in general. There is a side street where it is possible to park, including spots specifically for disabled parking. Access from the side street and the main road is possible by wheelchair.  Bellgrove train station is the closest to the venue (10 minute walk) but this is not yet accessible by wheelchair. Spacious disabled toilet available. There are two disabled bays right outside the venue plus other on-street parking options. Taxis can drop off outside the venue, there's just a short push over a paved area to get to the venue. Public transport doesn't go past but it's near the Gallowgate, so you could get a bus to there. The accessible loo was fine, a nice large room, clean and well laid out, with a red cord all the way to the floor. Shame the bin was pedal operated, though! Also the loo is on the ground floor level while the concert hall is on the first floor. We walked about 20 minutes from Glasgow queen street station, but that was by choice.  I've got an taxi right up to the front once. Great spacious clean accessible toilet. Red chord tie was not freely hanging. It’s on the ground level next to bar, it’s not too obvious that it's an accessible toilet, maybe larger sign? On street parking  Situation near the entrance "
saint michael and all saints church edinburgh,negative,"Yellow lines can be used by Blue Badge holders, but difficult for others. About 9 bus routes within 250m."
saint michael and all saints church edinburgh,positive,Wheelchair accessible toilet
saint spyridon church corfu,positive,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced.
salisbury cathedral salisbury,positive,"Local authority car parks and on street parking free with blue badge. I understand that you can book a blue badge parking space for £7 per day by the cathedral. We wanted to spend some time in the city centre, so we chose to park in the Cranebridge Road carpark (free parking for blue badge holders), which was a 5 - 10 minute wheel away. Spotless and well equipped with grab rails, shelves, etc etc. Accessible, easy to find, very clean"
salisbury woodland blackpool,positive,We traveled by bus and it arrived just across the road from the trail.  On the bus the driver was very considerate as he was asked to wait whilst we found a seat and he felt obliged. The parking isn't great near Stanley Park as there are a lot of cars. However if you do find a space it is a very good spot as there are a lot of crossings to the trail and the road is long so it isn't hard to locate.
sally white london,negative,"On street parking round the corner, it's a red route just outside. There is a big Tesco car park just down the road. Downstairs in the basement, so not accessible!"
salt museum salinas del carmen antigua,positive,"I did used the disabled toilets and found then spacious, both getting into and using, with grab rails on both sides.  As a bonus the seat was raised.  Ideal disabled toilets"
saltburn beach saltburn by the sea,positive,There is a car park with designated spaces - 3 hours free with a Blue Badge.
saltram plymouth,positive,"The main toilets are closed, presumably due to Covid, but there is a temporary toilet block including an accessible loo located in the carpark. I did notice a sign to toilets in the garden but I don't know if they were open and there was no accessible toilet with them.  The temporary loo in the carpark was quite long but not particularly wide. It was reasonably clean but the sink appeared to be a bit leaky. There were several bins and a fold-down changing table, but only large enough for a child."
saltyard edinburgh,positive,"Can't comment on parking. Lothian Buses 2,3,4,25,33 and 44 serve nearby bus stops and there is a pedestrian crossing controlled by lights for those alighting from a bus heading westwards. Clearly labelled, and it earns points for being labelled ""Accessible"" rather than ""Disabled"". It's an l-shaped space with plenty of room to manoeuvre a wheelchair. The alarm cord stretches down to the floor, the grab rails are well-positioned and include a vertical grab rail adjacent to the washbasin and hand dryer. There is space for side transfer onto the lavatory. See pic."
salvation army charity shop largs,negative,I normally travel to Largs by train but I think there are some disabled parking spaces across from this shop. Alternatively there is a seafront car park with disabled parking.
samphire hoe dover,positive,"Access is by car. Solid surface, flat car park. No charge for blue badge holders. Clean, spacious accessible toilet. Radar key needed. "
samuel jones smoke ale house exeter,positive,"There are pay and display disabled parking spaces 50m away from the venue. The toilet facilities were well signed, large, clean and had both grab rails and space for a carer."
san andres mill villava,positive,"There are near a bus stop, the buses are wheelchair accessible. The museum has reserved parking for people with disabilities. There are an accessible loo and it is easy to find, there are enough space to maneouvre, it has grab rails, there are space for a carer; and the toilet is very clean and tidy."
san cristobal island san cristobal,positive,The airports in Ecuador were fine. My room had a fully accessible wet room.
san diego zoo san diego,positive,Accessible parking was available near the gate. It might be better to use taxis or a shuttle bus though as these stop directly outside the gate. Sizeable accessible toilets were scattered across the park
san mames stadium bilbao,positive,"The parking and transport to the stadium was great! You could easily wheel yourself to the ground, the city of Bilbao is mostly flat. The stadium is also very well served by accessible public transport including Buses, Trams and Taxis, which all stop about 3 minutes away from the ground.  The disabled facilities were good, there were numerous accessible toilets just along from the Wheelchair Spaces, they were large spacious and had numerous grab rails in places should they be required."
san marino citta di san marino,positive,"We took the bus from Rimini, 15 minute service from The town square, journey time 30 mins, 15 miles, excellent both ways, the stadium car park was large and spacious, all on one level. No access issues."
sandakan pow camp sandakan,positive,We got a taxi and it dropped us right outside the entrance. There didn't seem to be any public transport nearby. It was in a quiet area on the outskirts of town so think parking would be fairly straightforward.
sandall park doncaster,positive,toilet easily visible clean with ample space for a carer
sandbanks beach cafe poole,positive,"Plenty of clearly marked out disabled bays. You will have to pay, even if you are tax exempt. Only Poole residents who have registered their vehicle are allowed to park for free. Large disabled toilet, clean and fresh. RADAR key access.   Sadly like many disabled toilets it is also a baby changing area. Unacceptable."
sandcastle water park blackpool,negative,"This is the only thing I say is an issue because we drive a van and the parking has a barrier across with a hight limit you can only parl for 3 hours with badge, and its an all day out place. so its a pain yo go out and move the car. very few disabled spaces, lets it down a bit"
sandcastle water park blackpool,positive,"Car park next to venue very reasonable  Changing places  Easy and good disabled access and parking Clear and very accessible Some of our group arrived by car and were able to park adjacent to the building in the accessible parking bays. I and my companion arrived by Tram which was super accessible for me as a powerchair user. With a Changing Places Toilet on site and numerous other accessible loos and changing rooms it was fabulous. The accessible changing rooms were poolside and had ample room for changing. Staff were on hand should you need anything. Disabled parking right outside, with accessible ramp.  Large accessible disabled loos.  Perfect x This must be one of the few place in Blackpool with parking so near and accessible there is a large council pay and display car park just south of the venue. There is also some parking available on the promenade near the venue. The South Pier Tram Stop is ideal for this venue and is only a short walk away. The toilets are clean and accessible We parked right outside the front There is a large car park directly beside the water park. The only issue is that the Disabled Parking spaces get filled up pretty quickly.   Public transport wise, the Tram stops directly outside. They have power wheelchair access.  Great. An extra point for having a Changing Places toilet (love the decor too!) Tram transport was great for the wheelchair to just outside the venue Full accessible wet room with all aids a few changing rooms and an accessable loo as well There is free parking on the front for blue badge holders Easy access disabled toilets and wet rooms This was fine I use a car and parked in the carpark in the front for free The toilet I used was accessible with a changing bed shower and hoist as well as lots of space we did have a problem with water pressure in the shower but I reported this so hopefully it has been resolved Tran stop outside and plenty of disabled parking nearby in car park Poolside changing rooms with shower and toilet facilities and large changing table with hoisting for visitors who wear products There are disabled parking spaces right next to The Sandcastle. Staff escort you to one of the disabled changing rooms - each has a shower (with shower seat) and bench and plenty of room. Lockers solely for the use of disabled visitors are located right outside the loo and the First Aid team will look after the key for you so you don't have to take it into the loo. If you need more than one locker - that's fine."
sandos san blas nature resort and golf tenerife,positive,"We didn't drive there but taxis dropped off right outside the door and there was lots of parking available. There were disabled toilets throughout the hotel, including next to all the pool areas. The bathroom in the adapted room was also spacious and had a shower seat."
sands a place by the sea aberdour,positive,Next to men's in cafe/toilet building. Would suit many disabled people. Basic but clean when I went. Room for a wheelchair but I didn't need to manoeuvre in the space. Grab rails.
sandy bells edinburgh,negative,On street parking only Buses stop outside (few metres away)
sandy bells edinburgh,positive,"It is unusual to find such a good facility in an old Edinburgh building.  There is an idiosyncratic toilet seat shaped like a fiddle (I always smile to see it)    You probably have to squeeze past the players to get to the loo,  but everyone accomodates.   If you don't like busy venues, probably not for you! The toilet is almost a third of the size of the bar - plenty space for a wheelchair user and assistance or two. Funky toilet seat aswell (see pic!) made me laugh and seeing a red cord hanging low and in a good place made me smile too! Handrails are on either side of the toilet and also at sink. Toilet paper is on left hand side bit of a stretch but I managed. Few bits of paper on floor but apart from this it was very clean."
sandymount hotel dublin,positive,There are good public transport links into the centre of Dublin and surrounding areas with the Landsdowne Road Dart station a short wheel/walk away. There is also a Car Park at the Hotel which is available for use on a first come first served basis it also has a few Disabled Parking bays near the entrance to the hotel. 
santa ana cathedral las palmas de gran canaria,positive,The cathedral is in a pedestrianised area but there are buses that stop nearby.
sarahs barber shop rushden,negative,No parking for the salon. Lidl is opposite with a car park. Or there is a general car park with one accessible space.
saughton park edinburgh,positive,"I came via bus but do know there are blue badge spaces next to the cafe area of the park. Getting to the park was easier than we expected. We arrived by bus, the number 22, and short walk took us to the nearby entrance. Once in the park it was a level, smooth, tarmac path that followed the edge of the playing fields to the skate park and entrance to the gardens.  When we left the park we decided to explore and find the Balgreen Tram stop - it was surprisingly closed being on a ten minute stroll along the road.  If you wanted to visit using a car there are two car parking areas. One at the main entrance to the gardens and the other at the rear of the gardens. Both had several accessible parking bays by the entrance. If you a heading for the Bistro for a coffee or a bit to eat it's best to head for the rear car park. It can only be five stars for the park and gardens as there are accessible toilets and a Changing Places Toilet!"
saundersons edinburgh,positive,"There is ample parking outside the shop, with bus services stopping southbound 25m away services 11, 15, 16, 23, 36 and 45 and also northbound, a pedestrian crossing is 35m from the northbound bus stop."
savoy grill london,positive,Fine once you get there
savoy park hotel ayr,negative,"Lots of parking but could not see andy painted disabled spaces Needed to drive chair through narrow area to get to disabled toilet, this was in the ladies toilet. No running water in sink or soap. Had to use main sink and had to pull hand soap off from holder on wall to use it as it was up to high and i would not have been able to use the hand push pump on top. "
savoy theatre london,negative,Unfortunately this really let the place down. The toilet was behind a two door entrance with right angle turn. The accessible loo was not large enough to get my wheelchair in. I’m luckily able to walk a little bit so could manage but this would be an issue for someone who needs a direct transfer. 
scaling dam saltburn by the sea,positive,"We drove there and parked in the general car park. It said that blue badge holders didn't have to pay but it either didn't say (or we missed it) that there is accessible parking near the toilet block. This would have made it much easier but by the time we saw it, we had already made our way down from the car park. Toilets were easy to find and reasonably clean considering they are open to all. My only complaint is that the toilet is very low. "
scandic byporten oslo,positive,"Took the Flytoget train from Oslo airport - great system with inbuilt ramps at the wheelchair section and a very helpful conductor who seemed to magically appear at the right moment.  The train arrived at Oslo station which was connected via a shopping centre to the hotel. Great toilet, lots of handrails and of comfort height (So happy not to have to ask for a raiser).  Took 0.5 off as toilet paper dispense in the most awkward place."
scandic hamburg emporio hamburg,positive,"There is accessible parking under the hotel for a charge, but we found a disabled spot - with no time restrictions - directly outside the hotel entrance, so we used that instead.  On one of the few times it was used, there were other parks very close by well sign-posted, full accessible, grab rails, plenty of  space, very clean and well maintained"
scandic hotel copenhagen,negative,"There isn't much in the way of parking but given that it is only a short walk from the station and there is a drop of spot outside the door for taxi's this makes it accessible.  However, we didn't have a car with us, so if you do, phone ahead and arrangements might be possible."
scandic hotel copenhagen,positive,There are toilets on the ground floor and the toilets in the room are accessible as well.   Unable to comment on the ease of use of the loo's as visitor does not use them independently.
scandic victoria oslo,positive,Within 15 minutes walk of Oslo's main train station Accessible bathroom with plenty of room to manoeuvre in a manual wheelchair. Grab rails and shower seat all ideally positioned. 
scarborough fair collection vintage transport museum scarborough,positive,"There is plenty of Parking and a few Disabled spaces. You can drop people off right outside the main entrance then go and park if need be. Parking is Free. Toilets are sign posted, they are situated in the Ballroom next to the Counter.  All Toilets are in the same area, Disabled Toilet is large enough for a carer."
scarborough sea life scarborough,positive,"Disabled parking bays are directly next to the front entrance. Site does have an accessible toilet with an alarm cord, the door opens outwards and door frame is a reasonable size, toilet is also a good size to fit a wheelchair and carer/worker in. The only problem is that there was only one accessible toilet near the gift shop at the front entrance, although it is normal to only have one, the sanctuary is big and with the large number of people there that day, it took a while to get round to the toilet. The toilet was in the gift shop next to all the other toilet doors which was quite crowded and this made it hard to come in and out of the toilet."
scarborough tec scarborough,positive,There are bus stops right outside of the college with the nearest train station only 1.4 miles away. The accessible toilets are easy to find and they are also gender-neutral toilets.
scarsdale vets nottingham,positive,"Disabled parking bay outside the door. Public transport is awkward if you coming from Derby like I am, takes about 1 hour 10 minutes and 2-3 buses. Bus stop to and from Derby is minute walk from vets. Bare in mind the bus direct to Derby runs hourly."
scheveningen woods the hague,positive,"Can't comment on the parking, and the tramline (number 1) which gets you to the entrances to the park is not yet wheelchair accessible, though they are working on it. Buses numbered 22 and 28 get you close to the park from the city centre, and are wheelchair accessible."
schloss cecilienhof potsdam,positive,"There is an accessible toilet in the grounds, about five minutes walk/wheel from the Schloss."
schonbrunn palace vienna,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Schoenbrunn U-bahn station ( fully accessible) is ten minutes' level wheel away, with one main road to cross at traffic lights. There's an accessible toilet at the very far end of the ticket office, reached by a platform lift. There's another one just inside the visitor entrance to the palace. Both are a reasonable size and have grab rails and alarms."
school hall eton college windsor,negative,no reserved spaces. Street parking where allowed
school house coffee bar horncastle,positive,"Car park gravelly,  but ok to wheel across as not loose or deep. Big, with all the drop down rails you needed. No changing table but lots of too . I’m not great at transferring and I managed ok. Normal height loo."
schott music london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby. Zillions of buses go up and down nearby Oxford St and Regent St. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area. This is the first sheet-music shop I have ever come across with an accessible toilet. It's a good, spacious, well-designed toilet, and loses TWO stars because someone has very thoughtlessly tied the red emergency cord around the grab-rail, making the cord absolutely no use at all if you fall to the floor and need to summon assistance. See my photo below."
schuh glasgow,positive,Not toilets in shop but access to ones in Buchanan galleries 
science and industry museum manchester,negative,Big queues 
science and industry museum manchester,positive,Close to Metrolink station - trams very accessible and station has a lift.    Plenty of accessible parking bays.  Street parking outside. MIF Staff told us where parking was before the event and how to access the venue.
science museum london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby. Several bus routes will drop you off at South Kensington Station or outside the Victoria and Albert Museum or the Natural History Museum, from where it's a short roll/walk to the Science Museum. The 3rd floor ""accessible"" toilet near the special exhibitions area is NOT accessible. It's tiny, you can't turn around inside it in your wheelchair, there are insufficient grab-rails, and the red cord is much too short - it would be impossible to reach it if you fell to the floor in the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back. See my photos below. This toilet is a disgrace.   I tried also a toilet on the 2nd floor, which was laid out more intelligently.   Accessibility on the tube in the area leaves a lot to be desired and there are limited bus services in the area. I went in 4 of the toilets in the museum in the end, in the hope of finding a good one ! Found two with red cords stored incorrectly and two that weren't big enough to turn a chair or even make an attempt to. Doors also spring loaded in some cases making it harder to reverse out.  The toilets themselves cleanliness wise were average but then that's to be slightly expected when doubling up as a baby change I guess."
science museum london,positive,They have space for 8 or 9 blue badges right outside the main entrance with the usual London public transport if you need it. I;d suggest to get there before 10:30 as it does get busy. Quite a few disabled toilets but some include baby changing facilities so had to queue a couple of times. They were clean though and well laid out.
scone palace perth,positive,"Drove. Parking was as close to the building as practical. Easily accessible beside other toilets.  Large, clean and tidy. We parked in the main car park, but could have had a barrier raised to access disabled parking much nearer to the house. It’s worth noting that if you walk / roll from the main car park to the house, there is a section of gravel outside of the house that may hamper some folk. I was able to push through with a little difficulty. If you opt for the disabled parking next to the house, you’ll avoid this and everything is smooth tarmac.  We came by car, disabled parking is right next to Palace disabled entrance  All toilets on bottom level, close to restaurant and cafe. Very spacious and clean "
scotland street school museum glasgow,positive,"There is a multi-storey car park directly opposite the school, and just beside that is an underground station (shields road).  Buses also are in this area, but we didn't use them. The accessible toilet was ok. Pretty standard facilities.  Think this area could probably be improved/smartened up, but I would say the same about the other toilets too. Was disappointed to see the emergency cord was tied up in a knot so couldn't be used, especially when it already had a Euans Guide card on it!"
scotsdales garden centre great shelford,negative,"There is one accessible toilet, situated just inside the entrance. Access to this is via a corridor to the right of the main entrance. As accessible toilets go it's not the most modern or best equipped, and manoeuvring a wheelchair out into a fairly narrow corridor may not be easy. There is a drop-down rail on the left of the toilet, with space for side transfer."
scotsdales garden centre great shelford,positive,"Scotsdales has a large car park, with designated ""disabled"" parking in various places close to the store, and step-free access from there."
scottish council for voluntary organisations edinburgh,negative,There is an accessible toilet but it is not particularly large and may be tricky for some larger powerchair users to negotiate.
scottish crannog centre kenmore,negative,"Parking is available across the road a couple of disable spaces.  A short walk over to the entrance which is down a hill and a bit uneven. Parking is available across the road and there are a couple of disable spaces.  A short walk over to the entrance, which Is down a hill and a bit uneven, for someone in wheelchair may be a bit uncomfortable."
scottish crannog centre kenmore,positive,"There is a disabled toilet on right hand side of main entrance, sign posted well, enough room for a carer. There is a disabled toilet on right hand side of main entrance, sign posted well, enough room for a carer."
scottish football museum and hampden stadium tour glasgow,positive,"Ample parking with designated bays, train or bus is not close, train 750 m bus 500m steep inclines and descents to and from the stadium. As the museum is in the main stand where the hospitality  rooms, function suites and administration are located the toilets are fully andwell appointed with plenty space. However if you are a spectator in the other stands, a totally different and disappointing story."
scottish game fair at scone palace perth,negative,There is free parking *near* to the entrance but the grass is quite long and was a challenge for my powerchair so pushing a manual wheelchair would be difficult. It’s still fairly far to walk (unless your there first thing) so iff your hiring a wheelchair or scooter then be aware you may need to walk a good 40 feet min to the entrance. Kudos for the free parking though. 
scottish game fair at scone palace perth,positive,"The accessible toilet was great! Smooth ramp up, huge space, even with a shower! I didnt see a changing places toilet though and you would NOT want to change someone on those floors. "
scottish maritime museum linthouse building irvine,negative,I think the easiest way to get to the maritime museum is possibly by car due to its harbourside location. I think it may also be accessible by bus  The accessibile toilet has hand rails however is quite small for a wheelchair user and personal assistant. I placed a red cord card on the red cord as it was tied up
scottish national gallery edinburgh,negative,"There are a limited number of parking spaces directly outside the building. There are bollards stopping cars entering this area but security comes out and you just need to request accessible parking with showing the blue badge and if there is enough space they will let you in. Otherwise parking can be problematic as it is located in the centre of town.  There is an excellent public transport service, with numerous buses stopping within a few minutes walk and a tram stop almost directly outside the door."
scottish national gallery edinburgh,positive,"Better loos are found in the basement. Use the lift from the mound entrance or enter via the gardens entrance (less immediately accessible from street level). Two large disabled loos are on the right after exiting the lift, or through the cafe and to the left from the gardens entrance. The national galleries saved the day 5 prole in need of accessible toilets were most impressed by the helpful staff ad the ease in which we were able to access the building :)  congrats to  you all and thanks for your hospitality In a very central part of the city, lots of bus links on the roads surrounding. Taxi ranks nearby too. Close to Edinburgh Waverley Station.  I arrived from the street side of the Mound and had used a Lothian bus to get there. Great service, as all the buses have low floor level access and powered ramps that the driver puts down at the touch of a button. The Galleries are also right next door to one of Edinburgh's new tram stops; again a great accessible service. Taking the lift to the lower level, think it's called the Garden Level, you come out by the cafe, shop and restaurant. Here you can link to the other Gallery building where a similar lift will take you upstairs.  There are two accessible loos adjacent to the main toilets, just look out for the signs to get you there. Both are of the spacious and of a narrow style but worked for me as a powerchair user."
scottish national gallery of modern art edinburgh,positive,"41 and 43 to Queensferry Road then a few minutes walk or the once an hour on the 13.    Pavement is quite narrow.   Could do with some more dropped kerbs on one side of the road. Parking is good A few disabled parking space available at rear of gallery. Excellent - disabled parking right at entrance and right beside ramp. There are several disabled parking spaces available onsite next to the entrance but it would be quite a long walk from Princes Street but there is a bus route.  The gallery also has a bus which runs between Edinburgh galleries but I don't know if it is accessible. Toilets were very clean and spacious with grab bars and red cords.  There is also a Changing Places  toilet available with hoist and bench at the back of the building. Couldn't get an closer if you tried! Parking was right by the front door. One accessible toilet is located on the lower level adjacent to the cafe. A lift takes you from the other floors down to that level and is large and deep enough for a couple of wheelchairs, it has audio feedback and tactile control buttons. The accessible toilet has a large doorway and space to manoeuvre. If coming by car there is set disabled parking. It is about 15 mins from Haymarket station. For the more active you can also access the gallery by a set of stairs coming up from the Water of Leith. If you're arriving from Belford Road you know you're at the right place as there is an Antony Gormley statue to greet you at the entrance! Being a former school there is ample parking space as well as dedicated disabled parking with ramp access to the entrance. Although there is no Lothian Bus service that passes the Gallery Edinburgh Coach Lines No13 is available on both sides of Belford Road. There is a shuttle bus with disabled space and access that leaves from the Mound Galleries and visits the Portrait and Gallery of Modern Art campus.. There is a donation requested of  £1 per journey as it’s a charitable run service - brilliant and runs every 30 mins. The newly opened Changing places loo was excellent as were the other facilities, fully provisioned and serviced. The signage was unobtrusive but clearly marked throughout the Gallery. The bus stop was very near to the gallery and it was very easy to get there. There were accessible toilets which were very well located."
scottish national portrait gallery edinburgh,negative,There are single yellow line spaces nearby. Buses and Trams (soon) stop very close (although there is a bit of a climb back up to St Andrew's Square afterwards to catch some routes). I came via the Edinburgh trams which are great for wheelchair access in my opinion. I got off the York Place tram stop and rolled 5-10 minutes to the museum on Queen Street. I believe buses also go along these streets and the streets behind however I am unsure about the parking situation. Back lane access and a few parking spots there.
scottish national portrait gallery edinburgh,positive,"Parking in nearby St Andrew Square in pay and display. Buses run along Queen Street. An accessible toilet on the ground floor. Large, clean and well equipped. Door can be tricky as it opens into the flow of people visiting the male toilets. There's an accessible loo on the ground floor which was large enough, although could have been a bit cleaner. The door opens out which is good. I'm not sure about upper floors. The buliding is very accessible by bus, has nearby parking and there are is also tram stops and waverley train station within 20 minutes walking distance.    Clean toliets are available with facilities neccessary for disabled people."
scottish seabird centre north berwick,negative,Parking can be very difficult in North Berwick at weekends - we struggled to find spaces near the seafront. There are lots of public parking places in the town however.
scottish storytelling centre edinburgh,negative,"Being a building on the busy Royal Mile; parking is not easy. but is possible in adjacent streets. Buses however, stop right outside or its a 15 to 20 minute walk from Waverley Railway Station. No disabled parking so had to get the bus but still very easy to get to as plenty bus routes. Parking is very limited on the Royal Mile. There are accessible buses services passing along by the Centre. It was possible to park directly outside to drop off and pick people up but there is no disabled parking."
scottish storytelling centre edinburgh,positive,"Full marks for having accessible toilets on each floor! No having to do the interval dash to different floors! Each of the loos was spacious and had slightly different layouts ... 'yes', I did go and look at the all - can't help it when curiosity grabs you! Even  had Euan's Guide Red. Cord Cards ... Adequate disabled toilets. There's a good accessible loo just around the corner from the Cafe. You have to pass through a glass door and this is quite heavy; you may need a hand to get through if you're a wheelchair user.   The toilet is large, well appointed, and clean. The accessible loo was very easy to find and was also pointed out to us by the venue staff on our arrival. It was clean and tidy. Relatively easy parking if you have a blue badge as you can park on the high Street if there are spaces or sticks yellow lines. Ther are buses that take you to the top of the road and the pavements are easy to move on. There is ample parking around the Royal Mile, parked on Chambers Street next to the museum however this might not be practical if you have difficulty walking. The toilets are spacious and clean."
scotts bar restaurant troon,negative,Only 1 disabled bays nearby. Parking is in the marina so there are loads of spaces . No public transport nearby
scotts bar restaurant troon,positive,Disabled loo through bar and might be a bit awkward in a chair. Modern loo with mirror and  handrails and quite spacious
scotts in the park edinburgh,negative,Parking and public transport is some distance away.
scotts in the park edinburgh,positive,"Big, easy to get in, clean and well equipped. Everything you would expect to find even if it is in a tent."
scotts of helmsley helmsley,negative,Clean but a bit tight on space
scotts of helmsley helmsley,positive,"We went to Helmsley in the Car, sadly the tight wad Borough Council don't allow the less able visitors to park free (be warned !!) but you can park along the street as we did and walk along to the Main Square (we had a wheelchair with us)"
scotts queensferry,positive,We drove to the restaurant. There is a car park with disabled parking spaces just beside the restaurant.  See photo 
sculpture garden glasgow,negative,Parking was in the Blue Badge parking area. From there it was a fifty metre walk into the Scuplture Garden. The parking area was confusing as the lines on the ground didn't clearly indicate where to park. Getting out of the vehicle you had to cross over a thin line of cobble like stones to get onto the main walkway. These were a problem for the manual wheelchair. Toilets are available in the nearby House of an Art Lover. You do need to go down steps or use the ramp (a slope from the drive) to get in.
sculthorpe moor nature reserve fakenham,positive,"Birding for all website gives full details of parking. Disabled parking - three spaces - is close by the entrance to the reserve's main building. the parking is on a concrete base.  See Sculthorpe website for transport info: http://hawkandowl.org/sculthorpe/about-sculthorpe/ The two disabled loos are completely accessible for wheelchairs and have suitable grab rails etc. and are clean. One toilet is inside the building and the other outside in the rear of the building. The disabled parking is just outside the visitor's centre, but you can drive right down to the start of boardwalk if you have difficulty walking.  I didn't bother as the gravel is hardcore and not loose so not a problem for my electric wheelchair. Adequate toilet We parked in the normal carpark. There is access  via a dirt road for cars, to the start of the Boardwalk. Good disabled loo with grab rails and space for carer. We drove and parked in the normal carpark Two disabled access toilets were very easy to use"
sea containers london london,positive,Large accessible loo on ground floor
sea front public toilets torquay,positive,"The toilets are on the sea front, about a 10 minute level walk from Torquay Train Station and several bus numbers stop along the sea front."
sea life london aquarium london,negative,"I give them three stars as there were a couple of different points with toilets, including accessible toilets. But - I didn't use them or look in so not sure how well fitted they were. There are buses & taxi ranks nearby, but accessible tube stations are lacking. Has loo's but was very difficult to get into not very clean at all and worst off no bog roll Waterloo Station is nearby and the Jubilee Line offers step-free access but beware - the Jubilee Line lift has had severe problems for months and is frequently out of service - check before you travel! A few bus routes will drop you off in York Way, which is round the corner from County Hall. Not enough thought has gone into the accessible toilet. As you can see from my attached pictures, the place is cluttered with enormous bins in the wrong places, making a sideways transfer to the toilet impossible, and the red emergency cord is located in a ridiculous place, in a corner behind a bin. How can you possibly reach it if you fall over? This can be a life-and-death matter. In addition, some of the toilets were out of order, necessitating enormous detours to get to a working toilet. Not impressed. We got the bus to Westminster Bridge - and although the buses are great we didn't realise there's no step-free access to the lower area where the Sea Life centre and other attractions (including the London Eye) are located from that road. I wouldn't have been able to walk around to the other side to get into that area (it was too far away), so I had to hop down a lot of stairs instead, which wasn't great."
sea life london aquarium london,positive,"We arrived via London Waterloo Station which has step-free access. It is less than ten minutes walk from the station along mostly smooth paths and crossings with dropped curbs. There is not enough signage, though, if you do not know the route. train and bus access not to far away"
sea the change   beach wheelchairs eyemouth,positive,"There are two disabled parking bays down at the beach.  Discussions with the local authority are ongoing about getting a third parking bay.  In the summer, Coldingham bay can be very busy and you may find that these bays may be occupied on arrival.  If this is the case we recommend that the wheelchair user is let out at the parking bays and the driver takes the car upto the main carpark.   However, we realise that this may not be feasible but unfortunately the project does cannot reserve a parking bay There is a disabled toilet on close by to the parking, accessible by a Radar Key, although admittedly I have not use them.  The beach wheelchair volunteer will have a radar key if you don’t have your own."
seacity museum southampton,positive,Southampton is well serviced with car parks. Local transport is largely accessible.  Accessible toilets on the ground floor. Lift to all exhibits. 
seacliff stables north berwick,positive,Large parking area right next to the stables.
seacroft green shopping centre leeds,positive,"There are lots of disabled parking bays and there is a bus station in the grounds It could have been cleaner, but it was quite late in the day when I went in. The accessible toilet is the first thing you come to in the toilet block. "
seagull trust cruises limited falkirk,negative,We took a taxi to it as it is quite a walk from the bus stop. Disabled parking  is available at the entrance. Can tell you that there is a loo on baird but didn't use it so don't know how good or bad it is. can't review the toilet other than to say there is one as we didn't need to use it.
seagull trust cruises limited falkirk,positive,"Aasy access  to Parking and the Boathouse Fully Accessible toilets in teh boathouse and the boats Large room for carer, clean tidy Loads of parking but could do with more disabled spaces, although you can drop-off at the visitor centre if the spaces are all taken. Loads of parking at the boat house. Flat access from carpark to boat house."

seamill house hotel west kilbride,positive,I usually go by car However it is possible to go by bus as there is a bus stop further along the road which is accessible and it’s just a short walk to get to the seamil house hotel There are several accessible parking spaces available in the car park which is round the back of the restaurant. The car park is there in a bit of a slope so it is best to go slowly when going back to your car.Main road I was advised having someone walk beside you is there is quite a cumber on the pavement which can be quite disconcerting. As you turn the corner onto the pavement there is a small pothole which is difficult to avoid. The hotel has a large accessible toilet with handrails around the toilet.
seastar holiday cottage deal,positive,"there is parking next to the front doors - we travel in a large renault master van - plenty of room accessible facilities including level access shower and appropriate toilet - shower seat also available and conventently placed next to one of the accessible bedrooms  We drove, in fact it took 4 cars to take all of us and our equipment there! One place on the drive but loads of street parking. Several toilets and bath/shower rooms inside, including the wetroom"
seaton delaval hall whitley bay,negative,"The car park slopes slightly and is deep, uneven gravel - so difficult to wheel or walk on. There can't have been many disabled spaces as we had to park in a non disabled space and couldn't see any accessible parking."
seaton delaval hall whitley bay,positive,"Didn't use it but giving them the benefit of the doubt - it looked fine from a distance! This was the loo in a temporary building near the stables area.  There are other loos near the woodland walk start, however these do NOT include a disabled loo.  The accessible loo is not specifically marked on the map."
seaton tramway seaton,positive,The parking has improved recently and they now have disabled spaces at Seaton station. When we were there we had to park across the road in a car park. There is a disabled toilet at Colyton station and a toilet at Seaton station There is no train station at Seaton. A number of local buses stop and pick up close to the newly opened Seaton tram station. I'm unsure about public transport to Colyton village which is the tram station at the end of the line. There is an accessible toilet at Colyton tram station which has grab rails. There are no toilets on the trams.
seaton wetlands seaton,positive,Longish hike/scoot from Seaton (half a mile) or there is a good car park (look out for symbol of bird as it is tucked behind the cemetery!). If you can access Seaton tram (not suitable for wheelchairs) you can take a trip to Colyford and visit reserve before making the return journey.
sec   scottish event campus glasgow,negative,"not very well signed  Dissabled parking on Floor 2 This was my first time visiting the SEC, I’m a regular at the Hydro though so knew the parking at the venue wasn’t great. We parked across at The Village Hotel where we also went for tea (see separate review). This is a long walk if you have mobility problems, but in my powerchair it was smooth and easy, it took about 5 minutes to get there.  Again free for all. Non disabled folk using it and staff did nothing to stop them. "
sec   scottish event campus glasgow,positive,"We drove to the event and parked in the SEC multi-storey car park adjacent to the venue. There are several levels to the car park, all with lots of disabled spaces located next to the ticket machines and lifts. The lifts were spacious and quick.  There is a short walkway from the car park to the venue. It is wide, flat and has lifts down to the ground level entrance to the SEC area.  There was a spacious disabled toilet located in the centre of the main concourse of the SEC. It and grab rails and was big enough to manoeuvre. There was room for a cater to accompany.  There was only one disabled toilet which may have resulted in a bit of a wait at times as the event was very busy.  Massive car park if the one at the back and plenty of spaces, for the disabled and the main stream I dont know about the disabled but the main stream once were fine  Pricy but good  Dedicated parking spaces for Blue Badge holders. Several accessible toilets."

All Edinburgh buses have drop down floors, extended ramps and wheelchair access space, 5 priority seats and easy access button bells for stopping.

seven stories   national centre for childrens books newcastle upon tyne,negative,No parking at venue but there are numerous smaller car parks around the area Parking and transport to the museum is the hardest part of accessing this fab place! There is on street parking nearby (there is handy information on their website about this) but I couldn't see any disabled parking bays. There is a bus that you can get but you have to navigate down a fairly steep hill which might be difficult for wheelchair users.
seven stories   national centre for childrens books newcastle upon tyne,positive,"Disabled bays right outside Great! There are accessible toilets on several floors, some are within the male/female toilets and some are specific accessible toilets. They are spacious, with red cords hung correctly! There are accessible toilets on several floors and some with a delayed flush which is great for kids like mine who hate the noise. Changing table available on floor 1"
severn valley railway bridgnorth,positive,"Parking on flat smooth surface next to the stations at either end - limited blue badge parking but we had no problem. In Bridgnorth - follow signs up the hill to the actual station not the lower car park. Enter the platform by the gate not the ticket office. Adapted toilets to varying degrees at Kidderminster, on adapted carriages and most other stations. You would have to be brave to use the loo on a rocking steam locomotive! See photo. There are disabled spaces on site, flat (dropped kerb) access to the path to the station and flat path to the shop from where you can get a free parking token to use when you leave. There was an accessible toilet on the station platform with room to turn around a compact electric wheelchair (probably not a scooter).  The accessible toilet on the wheelchair carriage was good, with grab bars and some room to manoeuvre."
seville seville,negative,Not many fully accessible toilets. Most had grab handles but were small so not room for a carer or Changing Places.
sfoglia rina bologna,negative,See pic
shake shack covent garden london,positive,There are good bus links and a little on street parking.
shakespeare edinburgh,negative,"There simply isn't any parking nearby. You could arrive on a bus as there's a stop nearby. It's best suited to just rolling up on foot; well wheels actually. No Changing Places. The toilet is to the right hand side of the restaurant and is accessed by a RADAr key. Be careful not to trip down the two steps which lead to the male/female bathrooms, the accessible toilet is before this area."
shakespeare edinburgh,positive,Buses stop right outside Usher Hall. Not sure about onstreet parking.
shakespeares globe theatre london,negative,There was a standard disabled toilet but Lowri needs a Changing Places toilet. Knowing this in advance when planning the trip we asked to change her in the first aid room (using the hoist of Mum and Dad...) which worked ok.
shakespeares globe theatre london,positive,"Travelled by train: East Midlands parkway to St Pancras then Thameslink to Blackfriars. Excellent assistance at every stage. There are nearby tube stations, and on street parking, and a taxi to take you straight to the door. Easily accessed toilets with ample room for manoeuvre. Excellent Very spacious and clean. The one downstairs in the basement is best"

shanklin theatre shanklin,negative,"One small wheelchair accessible toilet, no room to turn a wheelchair round and no room for a carer.  One pull down handrail. Dirty and untidy."
sharjah art museum sharjah,positive,"We had access to my daughters car and we drove from Dubai probably 3/4 of an hour journey Although the toilets were at the end of a very long corridor there are exhibitions on either side, the accessible toilet was clean and accessible"
sharmanka kinetic theatre glasgow,positive,Loo is in the arts centre. Clear signage to help finf it.
sheffield botanical gardens sheffield,negative,The disabled parking for the gardens is located at the far end on the opposite side from the disabled toilets and café. This means you have to go up a long hill to access any of the amenities. This is ok but if you'd had a long journey to get there and needed the loo you'd have a fair trek to get there. There is one disabled toilet by the café. There was no emergency alarm which worried us slightly.
sheffield botanical gardens sheffield,positive,"You can find on-road parking at the top of the park, but it’s worth knowing that there is dedicated disabled parking at the bottom end, off Ecclesall Road (opposite the entrance to Berkeley Precinct). If none is available there, you can drive into the park itself, where there are 2 or 3 disabled spaces on the left. "
sheffield manor lodge sheffield,positive,"parking on a gravel area right outside the venue in a designated disabled space, no cost. Huge disable loo NOT being used as a store room!"
sheffield park and garden uckfield,negative,"There are two toilets (reverse designs) which require no key, to the right of the park as you walk through the entrance centre. They are signposted.  Due to the nature of the park the floors were wet and muddy and they were pretty cold. The floor is tiled and slippery when wet. The grab / support rail is a few inches further away from the toilet than it is supposed to be so I held on at arms length and prayed a lot.  A Changing Places toilet would be fantastic and a lot safer."
sheffield park and garden uckfield,positive,Plenty of hard core / compacted earth parking bays next to the entrance. The car park marshal said he didn’t think there were any bays free but we could take a left and have a look - we saw at least two so got lucky. They are just a few metres from the entrance.  Virtually outside the entrance Good
sheffield winter garden sheffield,negative,"It is in the city centre, a 20 minute walk away from the train station, and there are bus stops a within a 5 minute walk away from the venue. There are also a number of disabled parking bays on the streets surrounding the venue for blue badge holders. Public transport is the most convenient and cheapest form of transport however, due to the location of the venue being in the city centre and limited parking. There is a disabled toilet located on the ground floor in the Millennium Gallery, however for tourists who are unaware of it, it could potentially be quite difficult to find and could be advertised more clearly in the winter garden to make it easier for them to locate. Aside from this it has an adequate amount of space for manoeuvring inside and includes an alarm cord. There is no parking onsite, parking is a few minutes walk away in the City Centre. Buses stop nearby also in the City Centre."
sheikh zayed grand mosque abu dhabi,positive,We used a taxi from Abu Dhabi. Taxis good value and easily available. On the whole drivers helpful.
sheldrakes restaurant wirral,positive,ground floor loo wheelchair friendly
shepherds house bracknell,positive,"There are two Blue Badge parking spaces immediately adjacent to the main  entrance, with a ramp. The main car park is a short walk away.  There is a disabled toilet by the front entrance, which is accessible with a RADAR key - which is available from the nearby bar."
sheraton grand hotel and spa edinburgh,positive,"The hotel can be approached from two different routes and I ventured off to try both of them. If you arrive by car or taxi you will go to the main entrance. The way in is clearly signposted and there is parking by arrangement.  Within seconds of wheeling in the door, I’m a powerchair user, I was warmly greeted.   Later I tried out the pedestrian route into Festival Square. The entrance sits above street level and a large permanent ramp, built into the landscape, takes you into the Square. The hotel has accessible toilets in several locations. Even the Spa had an accessible toilet and changing area. Presumably has designated disabled parking however were directed by concierge to park directly outside entrance at rear of hotel, ideal Taxis can drop off at the front door; helpful to me as a visually impaired person.  The hotel is not too far from Lothian Road where there are bus services frequently passing by.  The hotel does have some on-site parking. There are several accessible toilets situated throughout the hotel. The one I saw was large, bright and well equipped. Buses, taxis and car all easy access. All spa patrons are given the loan of towelling dressing gowns and flip flops. There are different sized gowns and towelling slippers if flip flops won't stay on your feet. They will give disabled visitors as many towels as they need and extra ones or fresh gowns for lunch time.  I needed to ask for body lotion as there wasn't any automatically in the changing room. There weren't special bins for pads or catheter or stoma bags. I recommend that you wear your swimming costume under your clothes to make it easier and quicker to change when you arrive. (Just remember your underwear!!) The disabled changing room was fine as there was only one disabled patron, but had I had to share it with a friend or someone else, I might have had to sit in cold wet togs for a long time or I might have got very tired waiting in the spa until they were ready.  There is no changing table or hoist, but there are drop down hand rails next to the toilet and shower and grab rails by the sink and shower too. There is a drop down shower seat without arms. The floor got quite wet and slippery  as the shower drained slower and the slope of the floor was marginal compared to mine. However they said they would look into the issue. There are lockers which need a four figure code Which you need to remember. Park with blue badge by arrangement with porter"
sheraton new york times square hotel new york,positive,"The taxis was able to drop us right outside the hotel and if we needed another one the door men were more than happy to help us out. We were told that buses were available close by too, but we didn't use them. Also the hop on hop off tour buses stopped close by."
sherwood forest edwinstowe,negative,"A limited number of easily accessible parking spaces near the walking trails, but enough when we went there. Otherwise, the parking facilities are great and located close to the main access paths."
sherwood forest edwinstowe,positive,"Ignore signs for main car park and go to visitor centre where there is disabled parking. There is also a bus from Worksop that stops at the Visitor Centre. Good, clean disabled loo. Changing Places toilet and shower."
shetland museum archives shetland,negative,We walked from the ferry port - about 15 mins.  There was a small carpark to the side of the building.
shetland museum archives shetland,positive,"We drove and we parked in a car park at the side of the building which had a few disabled car parking spaces and plenty of space to get in and out of the car. Great! We parked right outside - there were a couple of designated blue badge spaces. The museum is a short drive from the ferry terminal so a great spot to stop off on your trip. Clean tidy and spacious - there were accessible loos on ground floor and next to the cafe. We walked/rolled from the Ferry Terminal, which was only a short walk about 15 minutes. I'm not sure of the bus schedule, but I believe there is a bus from the terminal that will pass this area. There was a carpark outside the museum and on the day we visited there was plenty of spaces. There was an accessible toilet downstairs next to the entrance, which was clean and a good size. There was also another accessible toilet upstairs next to the restaurant, which was a good size as it provided enough space to move around. Grab bars were both fixed and pull-down next to the toilet and sink. I was able to hang a red cord card on the emergency cord."
shibden park halifax,negative,Does have disabled parking but we was unable to get a disabled space as they were all taken up. it’s free parking for blue badge holders. Disabled toilet available with radar key but no changing places.

shipley country park ilkeston,positive,Lots of disabled parking spaces a short distance from the visitors centre. Disabled park for free
shipwreck treasure museum saint austell,negative,"We travelled by private car.  The museum doesn't have its own car park but is directly opposite the main Charlestown car park.  It was a busy day and this car park was full so we had to resort to street parking maybe half a mile up hill from the museum.  The hill was quite steep and because of Covid rules in the town i.e. Keep to the left, some of the downhill trip had to be in the road because the path was too narrow.  There were also a few missing dropped kerbs."
shoe zone paisley,positive,parking on first level of car park with buses available just outside front entrance
shoeburyness hotel southend on sea,negative,"They have a disabled toilet that is shared as a baby changing unit, however the toilet is a little on the small side, you can fit a manual wheelchair in there. Getting out, is a little awkward, there is little turn around. Best advice go out the same way you went in. "
shoeburyness hotel southend on sea,positive,"The train station is just around the corner, and the road opposite offers free parking. Also there is a bus stop for the #9 & 14, I know for sure. "
shoemarket blackpool,negative,There is some limited parking in the street area however this does fill up very quickly during the day.
shopmobility cardiff,positive,Disabled spaces reserved for Shopmobilty users. Shopmobility based in St David's Centre car park so good access by car.  Access on foot by lift from centre.

shore cottage luskentyre,negative,"Bathroom not suitable for wheelchair access. No grab rails available, but then it is not a cottage specifically designed for disabled use.Brought our own raised toilet seat. Shower over a bath"
shore cottage luskentyre,positive,"Off road private parking next to cottage. Tarmac surface. Access to cottage and parking up a steep slope, we found it easier to turn at the next lay by and access from other side. Similarly for leaving it was easier to turn car to face gates to exit, rather than trying to reverse through them"
shoreditch park london,negative,Some  on street parking in the adjacent roads. Buses also run along some of the nearby streets.
shotts healthy living centre shotts,positive,"Free parking and it was very easy to find, Again the building is wheelchair friendly, has disabled toilet, rails, good clear signage everywhere"
shotts railway station shotts,negative,If travelling on the Edinburgh line then for anyone who is disabled there is no parking for that platform. Although the only car park available is on the Glasgow line which is suitbale for those who are disbaled. If using the Edinburgh line then the journey from the parking area to the Edinburgh platform is lengthy due to current construction and this entails a journey up a very steep hill.
showcase cinema de lux derby derby,positive,Transport and parking is the same as written in my review of Derby Intu. Toilet for screen 3 was large with plenty of floor space. Even with all this floor space there was still a large bin next to the toilet. Grab rails around the toilet and sink.   Nearest changing places toilet is in Derby Intu. To access the cinema for a wheelchair user the easiest place to park is in the level 3 car park as it is situated just by the cinema lifts. There are plenty of disabled car parking spaces on that level. People can access the cinema by other means of transport for example the bus which is not too far from the Intu Centre. There are plenty of disabled toilets in the cinema on both floors and near the screens. In the toilets there are grab rails around the toilet and an emergency button incase of an emergency. The toilet it self is very spacious.
showcase cinema de lux leeds batley,positive,Disabled parking bays are right at the front of the cinema with the entrance accessible via a ramp.
showcase cinema de lux paisley paisley,negative,Two accessible loos. Could be better equipped but quite spacious.
showcase cinema de lux paisley paisley,positive,"Has its own large free car-park, with many marked disabled spaces all in a line nearest the entrance/pavement.  Pavement is also flat - no kerb- so easy to get onto in a wheelchair.  Haven't used public transport to it, I think there are buses to the area. Not the biggest accessible toilet, but nice and clean Ample Disabled parking close to doors."
showcase cinema de lux reading wokingham,positive,Good parking but the disabled spots are at the back of the building and that feels really horrible.
showcase vr dundee,positive,"There are parking spaces outside the building where Showcase VR is situated. These parking spaces aren’t marked though so, disabled parking aren’t visable. I would say there is plenty of space though to easily get out a car. Unfortunately, the ground surface of the car park is quite uneven and has a few pot holes so, some wheelchair users might find it difficult to drive on. I know I did, had to drive slowly to avoid bumps.  I don’t know much about the public transport in this area of Dundee but, I think there are bus stops nearby that have buses coming from the city centre. You would have to get a bus or taxi to Showcase VR if you came into Dundee by train as it is about a 5/10 minute drive away."
shrewsbury town centre shrewsbury,negative,Some parking bays now have bollards preventing access to people like myself from using them because you can’t get off onto the pavements!
shrewsbury town centre shrewsbury,positive,Shrewsbury is fortunate to have a great changing station room in the Darwin shopping centre and a privately managed one at ‘Nerdy coffee shop’ which is in Mardol(see my other reviews)   A lot of disabled parking which bring you out into on of the small shopping precincts. This is at the top the hill. Can't comment on the park and ride system. There seems to be plenty of toilets spread around in the precinct. These are Rador keys doors and kept to high standard.
shuttleworth old warden biggleswade,positive,Car or Taxi access only
siam park costa adeje,positive,"Siam Park provides a regular free bus from the main tourist areas - it's a distinctive double decker, and the bus stop has the Siam Park symbol.  The bus has two doors, the wider set in the middle of the bus would be most accessible if getting on in a wheelchair, the bus lowers to make this possible. There are disabled spaces and seats within the bus. However, these buses get extremely busy and can be quite a scramble to get onto. So, depending on your needs, you may consider whether or not this would be the best option.  There are plenty of taxis around. There are also local buses which are green, and have the same door/access arrangement as the Siam bus.  There is a small car park outside Siam Park, and the Siam Shopping Centre is nearby which has more parking.  It's also possible you will be staying somewhere near the park, as Last Americas is one of the main tourist areas. There were several accessible toilets throughout the park.  Although these were fine, it seemed a bit of a token gesture since there wasn't a lot of accessibility for the rest of the Park."
siam thai restaurant dublin,positive,"Lots of accessible parking in shopping centre, 5 min walk from Balally luas stop and Dundrum luas stop Fully accessible bathroom upstairs (use lift to access)"
sichuan house glasgow,negative,"Well signposted, I sat very close to them but did not feel pushed to the side. Made for a very comfortable experience. Red cord was not hanging to floor but I fixed this and told manager I did so they were thankful when I explained. Very clean. There was not a lot of turning space but enough room for myself in a powerchair and carer."
sichuan house glasgow,positive,"This restaurant is on Sauchiehall Street so I presume that parking is challenging. Public transport is ok, just not to the door. Charing Cross station is nearby and loads of buses nearby too. Accessible, just like it should be! Easy to reach too - close by the main eating area and not miles away down a corridor."
side gallery newcastle upon tyne,negative,"There is a bus stop outside, with accessible buses arriving every 10 minutes.  These buses connect with the main bus station and the railway station.  There are carparks within approx 400metres"

silverburn park leven,positive,"Lots of parking available  Public transport to the park may be a challenge, but there is a footpath from Leven to the Park.  The Park itself has a large car park Large disabled toilet, clean and spacious"
silverburn shopping centre glasgow,negative,Not easy to get from Glasgow City Centre by Car. Public transport is unreliable. 
silverburn shopping centre glasgow,positive,"always travelled there  by car– excellent parking facilities. And level access from the multi-storey undercover directly to shopping areas. A number of taxi stops plus public transport is also available. It can get a little crowded particularly on to holidays especially Christmas Silverburn has the best accessible toilets for miles around! They are clean and well looked after, and they have a large pull down changing table which is big enough for an adult to lie on. My son is ten and needs to be changed regularly when we are out and about. They really do have the best and cleanest disabled changing facilities I have ever used!  All public places should have large changing tables like Silverburn. It would make life so much easier! I travelled by car and parked in the multi-storey car park. There are disabled parking bays all around the centre, but I prefer the multi-storey as it has lots of disabled bays on the ground floor and provides great shelter from the rain. The toilets I used were next to the food court. They were spacious,  clean and had everything I needed. I have marked them as a 4 star, because I feel like they have missed the opportunity to install a changing places loo in such a large space. We visited the disabled toilets so we acknowledged that they were there. In the multi-storey car park, using Blue Badge  Appeared to be lots of disabled toilets at various places throughout the centre. Adequate size for the powerchair, clean & fresh Buses regular from most areas of Glasgow. Ample disabled parking inside multistory and outside too Disabled toilets are positioned along the length of the mall. They were clean although on a few occasions soap has not been available. The toilets are large enough to comfortably maneuver my wheelchair "
silverhill woods sutton in ashfield,positive,"There are several car parks at different entry points and street parking where there is no car park. We stayed at Teversal Camping and Caravan Site which is right opposite the woods, so we didn't need to worry about parking. "
silverstone towcester,negative,"By car.  Had to drive all the way past disabled parking, then through all the other car parks back the way we had already been to get to disabled car park (could have opened a gate for access.  Paid £25 per day Closest to disabled seating there were 2.  One of which was also a designated baby child change.  Queues for disabled far worse than for those with no disabilities...... instead you had people making comments about ""your not disabled "" "" you can't use this without a key"" Relatively easy to find ,could have with more given the amount of people there "
silverstone towcester,positive,"plenty of disabled parking in the Silverstone experience's dedicated carpark directly outside the front of the building Accessible toilet on both levels, we used the upper levels toilet, it was very clean and tidy, grab rails where needed and plenty of room to move around Very large disabled car park,but very expensive.£50 for a one day pass "

simpsons garden centre inverness,positive,"We drove and parked in one of the 12 Disabled bays at the entrance.   Accessible toilet just inside entrance, clean, handrails, emergency cord, room for a carer. We drove to the coffee shop and it was relatively easy to get to. There were 15 disabled car parking spaces  and evrey single car parking space had the proper room to get my mobility scooter out of the car so I was very pleased. The toilets are outside of the coffee shop. When you enter the garden centre, there is signs telling you where the disabled toilets are, once inside the toilet I felt that it had everything that I needed."
sir harold hillier gardens ampfield,negative,The toilet at the main entrance was not suitable for mobility scooters. The other accessible loo was a portaloo which was walk in only.
sister ray london,negative,"This shop is very near Oxford Street, served by zillions of buses. There are not step-free stations nearby, though when the new Tottenham Court Road station opens c. 2017 you will have step-free access to the tube just a couple of blocks away."
sitwell fish bar derby,negative,There is no disabled parking available but it is located a few seconds away from bus stops. 
sitwell garage ltd derby,negative,No disabled parking available.  The Spondon Flyer & Ilkeston Flyer stop near by. 
six by nico glasgow,positive,"Would have been fine apart from the plant and the vertical loo roll holder, which I knocked over while trying to turn round."
sizergh castle kendal,positive,There are several blue badge holder spaces adjacent to the Visitor Centre. 
skainos square belfast,negative,pushed wheelchair from another venue we had accessed by taxi - parking might be ok with a blue badge otherwise difficult.
skainos square belfast,positive,the disabled toilet by the restaurant entrance is not the one with a shower - that is located to the left down a corridor which is sometimes closed for functions so go in  through reception entrance if you want this. The disabled toilet with shower is immaculate the one at the restaurant isn't always as clean but not dreadful.
skanda vale hospice llandysul,positive,"This facility has a fair sized care park which is totally accessible for those in wheelchairs. It is large enough for day visitors and patients cars as well. By a taxi, but they also do have a free service to collect and drop off their patients. This facility has everything for people who need any care and so have toilets for people in all types of condition."
skegness aquarium skegness,negative,We caught the bus which was overcrowded due to it being peak season and there was no room for a wheelchair and all the disabled seats were already occupied. The bus stop is five minutes walk (approximately) from the aquarium.  There is a public car park behind the Aquarium approximately 2 minutes walk.  The Aquarium is also located 20 minute walk from the train station you can also catch a bus from outside the train station that drops you a 5 minute walk from the Aquarium .
skegness aquarium skegness,positive,"There is an accessible toilet.  however if you were on a mobility scooter you may struggle to manoeuvre in it , but a manual wheelchair user should have no difficulty. "
skelton lake services leeds,positive,The toilets are relatively new however they were not the cleanest & have notified the service station to improve the cleaning 
skipton building society york,positive,"There is a disabled customer toilet which is suitable for those who transfer independently or with assistance of 1 person, but would be too small and with out adequate room for 2 to assist. There are no hoist facilities."
skooty allan the decca shetland,negative,"Bathroom only had one handle beside the toilet. Shower was very high up, had shower doors that ended two feet from the floor and no grab handles, but had a bath weirdly enough. It was nearly impossible to get about the bathroom in my chair."
skydive st andrews glenrothes,negative,There was no accessible loo but the men's loo was fine for me as I was using a walking stick.
skydive st andrews glenrothes,positive,While there are no disabled parking spaces no spaces are marked so there is plenty of space. It would not be possible to get public transport but you could probably get a taxi from Glenrothes.
skylark cafe london,negative,Parking in this area is severely limited. A few bus routes pass nearby. Clapham Junction station is 1.2 miles away and is fully step-free. 
sleeperz hotel dundee,positive,"The hotel is in the centre of town so ideal for transport, right above the trainstation and a 5 minute walk from the bus station. There isn’t a car park but we were able to stop at the right side of the building by going down a different street.  There are many car parks around the Sleeperz Hotel due to it being so central, they are no longer than a 5-minute walk away. On street parking is also nearby. All parking is free for Blue Badge holders. When I visited, I parked in one of the two accessible parking spaces at the train station, they’re literally behind the hotel.  For guests stay at Sleeperz Hotel, if there are no available spaces in the nearby car parks, they can park in Greenmarket Multi Storey Car Park with 25% discount. It is a 5-minute walk away from the hotel, open 24/7 and free between 8pm and 8am.  Dundee Train Station is right underneath the Sleeperz Hotel, there is a taxi rank at the side of the train station and more in the city centre at least a 5-minute walk away. There are also bus stops within the city centre going all over Dundee and Angus. Dundee Bus Station is a 10-minute walk away from the Sleeperz Hotel.  I didn’t visit the accessible bathroom in restaurant area during my visit, there definitely was one though, I’m just not sure how big it is.  Within the accessible hotel room, the shower room is quite spacious. You are only able to transfer from the left-hand side of the toilet and the emergency red cord isn’t in the best position beside the toilet, it could be closer. But, there’s only one for the toilet and shower so it is in a good position if someone has fallen in the shower. The shower curtain is at a good length for guests not tripping over it or it not getting stuck in the wheels guests chairs.  There is no hoist in the rooms as I’ve mentioned and there is no Changing Place toilet, there is one though in the V&A Dundee which is located across the road at the side of the hotel. It’s open until 10pm. "
sleepy hollow newtownabbey,negative,large accessible toilet with all the handles however emergency pull cord is disconnected and tied around a handle and the room is used to store high chairs. Yuck!
sleepy hollow newtownabbey,positive,out in the countryside so has to be accessed by car. No dedicated disabled parking but a small flat car park.
slessor gardens dundee,negative,There was an accessible portacabin toilet beside the accessible seating area. It was quite small inside and I can imagine it would be difficult for a wheelchair user and a carer to help transfer if needed. There is no Changing Places toilet that is open during the times of concerts at Slessor Gardens.
slessor gardens dundee,positive,"Due to this event being central in Dundee, there are plenty of car parks nearby mostly council car parks. Most of the roads right next to Slessor Gardens are closed however, I noticed all of the car parks are still open. When I was organising my tickets I got sent a PDF with accessibility information, including where accessible parking is. I got dropped off though and would recommend you do this too as the car parks are busy.  The train station is right across the road from Slessor Gardens and has a taxi rank beside it. There are also taxi ranks more within the city centre and Dundee bus station is a 10 minute walk away. There are also lots of bus stops on mainly every street where buses visit regularly from all over Dundee and Angus."
sloanes restaurant wakefield,positive,"The restaurant is part of the hotel next door and parking is available, but I’m not sure if this is for hotel guests only.   The restaurant is about five minutes walk from Wakefield Westgate train station.  An accessible toilet is available near the hotel lobby. It is large with plenty of space to manoeuvre. Grab rails provided and the toilet was clean and tidy. Enough space for a carer. "
slow mex madrid,negative,"Madrid is unfortunately not great for wheelchair-friendly public transport, particularly in this area due to its narrow, winding, hilly streets (very beautiful, not very practical...). Buses are wheelchair-friendly but would not take you directly here. "
slow mex madrid,positive,"The toilets are along a corridor, and marked as female toilets. They are large, with a grab rail, and enough space for comfortable manoeuvring. Entirely step-free access. "
slug lettuce blackpool,negative,"Blackpool centre is a nightmare to park,  The council has removed some disabled parking and relocated others but they go quickly.  If you are lucky you can get a spot outside."
slug lettuce blackpool,positive,Clean toilet with a decent hand dryer
slug lettuce edinburgh,negative,I didn't use them but my friend did
slug lettuce leeds,positive,There is a disabled toilet and grab rails however the placement of grabs rails made this a challenge for myself. 
slug lettuce london,negative,"Pretty basic, in service corridor, but at least it's there"
slug lettuce london,positive,"Clapham Junction station is a few yards away, and is theoretically fully step-free, though the lifts often break down and the staff are unreliable and there are many features about the station which make it not really properly accessible, not least the outrageously steep subterranean slope near the lift to Platform 1.   Zillions of bus routes serve the area, so it's altogether quite transport-rich.  I wouldn't dream of trying to park nearby!"
slug lettuce manchester,positive,These are located to the right hand side of the venue. There was enough space inside for myself in a power chair and one assistant. Grabrails came down on either side of the toilet and I felt the sink was at a good height. You need a RADAR key to enter.
smithsonian air and space museum washington,positive,"We wandered in from the Mall and easy to find. Not sure about parking nearby. Clean, spacious & well signposted."
smokeys brighton,negative,No dedicated parking although there is nearby street parking & car parks. 
smyths toys superstores falkirk,positive,"There are lots of accessible parking bays immediately outside the shop. The pavements are very flat and level leading from the parking spaces up to the shop. There is no immediate public transport nearby, although the local train station and main bus stops are about a ten or fifteen minute walk away."
snails deli cardiff,negative,"No dedicated parking, but lots of on street parking ( we go early not the busy lunchtimes) Stairs. But a big room "
snake and tiger tattoo leeds,negative,"There is no disabled toilet in the parlour, but the nearest shopping centre is less than 100 metres away, and has two disabled toilets, one of which includes full changing facilities."
snow factor renfrew,positive,"There are a number of disabled parking bays available. There is a large car park with lots of disabled parking bays outside the entrance. We didn't have a problem finding a space. I also believe there are buses to Soar INTU Braehead and a bus station. A large accessible toilet is available next to the Disability Snowsports UK office. The toilet also has showering facilities and lots of space for moving around. The size of the toilet was ideal for us as we were able to change our clothes without struggling for space. There was also a hoist but you need to bring your own sling. We drove to the centre, and there were lots of accessible parking bays right by the main entrance to Soar. There is a bit of a walk from the main entrance through to the Snow Factor however. Toilets were spacious and clean, and there were plenty to be found. I am not entirely certain there are many ways to get to Soar other than in private transport There are 2 disabled toilets in the ski centre. One is close to the ski slope and i think is used as a bit of a ""free for all"" toilet. The other- which is usually a bit cleaner- is behind DSUK's office There is plenty of accessible parking which is patrolled so there is generally spaces available. I didn't use the toilet but a friend did and found it suited his needs perfectly (also a wheelchair user). LOADS of accessible parking bays. The toilet is almost as big as my bedroom!  Plenty space to manoeuvre, toilet is a good height and has plenty handrails (red cord is down to the floor).  Shower has a flip down seat and lowered shower head.  Only thing that lets it down is lack of changing table and hoist. It was easy to get there by car, it’s well signposted and the building is huge! There were lots of disabled parking bays at the front.  The bathroom was huge! There was a shower, a bench, and lots of space to change and manoeuvre. There was a red cord and grab rails. It was clean and tidy There are plenty of disabled parking spaces just outside of the venue. There is plenty very well signposted disabled parking at the main door of the venue, you must remember to display blue badge! Parking is free. There are large accessible toilets within snow zone which are well signposted. Next to DSUK's office there is a large accessible changing room, consisting of a wet room style shower, changing bench and toilet. There is a hoist available but you must bring your own sling if you require to use it."
snowbarhotel alpenland wildschonau,negative,"Going to give it 3 as I never actually used them, but my other wheelie friends did and had no complaints."
snowbarhotel alpenland wildschonau,positive,Not very many parking bays and due to the heavy snow it was hard to see where you could park.  Road up is extremely slidey.
so aberdeen,positive,"I parked outside Slater's menswear on Bon-Accord Street. It wasn't too far away and the parking was free as I displayed my blue badge.    The accessible loo had everything I needed, with plenty space and grab-rails etc. As you can see from the picture provided, the red pull cord wasn't tied up, but it didn't reach all the way to the floor either. The locking mechanism could be a challenge if you have reduced hand function, but I managed it well enough."
so coco inverness,positive,there is an accessible toilet opposite the counter. there is a sliding door & plenty of space. on our visit they were very clean & pleasant.
social bite edinburgh,negative,"Disabled parking was around the corner so it was not too far to walk  Lothian busses 12, 26, 22, and 31.  My Mum used the loo and she found fantastic "
society standard cardiff,positive,"Easy to find, spotlessly clean, space for carer.  No changing table and I didn't notice grab rails. Used to store high chairs which is why only 4 stars."
soderberg bakery shop edinburgh,negative,Reasonably frequent Lothian Bus 8 goes pass. 
sodermalm stockholm,positive,"Mariatorget Metro Station  Mariatorget Metro Station is located on the corner of Swedenborgsgatan, a pedestrianised street with lots of cafes and restaurants and a 2 minute walk to Mariatorget square. The metro station is on the red lines 13 and 14. It is 2 stops from Gamla Stan (Old Town) and 3 stops from T Centralen (main railway terminal) which has a number of line interchanges. With frequent trains this means it is very quick to access other parts of the city.   Mariatorget Metro Station is step free. It has a lift on the pavement outside of the station which goes to the ticket hall. Alternatively there are steps, including some steps with rails (see photo) which I saw a person using with a shopping trolley, but I have no idea if the gradient would make it suitable for wheelchair users. At the ticket hall level are ticket barriers. In front of the barriers there are brass rods on the floor. Where there are 3 rows of parallel rods this is where the entrance is to the ticket barrier. Where there is a single row of rods this is a no entry ticket barrier, as people are entering it from the opposite side. On the ticket barrier level there is also a small convenience store selling snacks, drinks, magazines, etc. There is then escalators or a lift, which is quite slow to travel and looks like it has been placed in the space where an escalator previously was as it is on a slope descending (see photo), which goes from the ticket hall to platform level. From here it is a level walk to the platform.  Sodra Railway Station  Sodra railway station is on the same street as  Mariatorget Metro Station and a few minutes walks away. This railway station is a commuter railway line. However trains from here go direct to Arlanda Airport. There are 2 trains per hour from Arlanda Airport to Sodra and the train journey takes about 40 minutes.  Please note that the trains to Sodra depart from Arlanda Central Station in Sky City, although you remain indoors, this is a quite a walk from the airport terminus.  The final thing to note about this route is that even if you have a pre-paid travel card you have to pay a supplement of 120 SEK (2019) to travel on this route. It was explained to me that this is because it is a train line owned by a different company and you pay an additional charge at the start or end of your journey to cover these charges.   Sodra railway station has a lift from street level, where the ticket office is, to the platform. Outside the station I noticed a sign for special assistance (2019). It said in Swedish and English Meeting Point Pre-Booked Assistance for help and further advice call +46 774 55 55. There was also some writing in braille. There was also a logo of 2 people walking holding hands.   For both the commuter trains and Metro there were lifts (Hiss in Swedish) and in the carriages there were priority seats. I didn't notice any designated wheelchair spaces but I was always making for the nearest carriage, so I feel unable to comment on that. On board there are announcements in Swedish, and occasionally in English, there is also a board in each carriage and an announcement for the next stop. The board shows or announces nasta (which is Swedish for next) and then it says the stop. Public transport is excellent and frequent."
sofitel london heathrow longford,negative,Also good - both in the Hotel and the ensuite facilities in the rooms.
soho theatre london,positive,"Soho Theatre is on Dean Street in the heart of Soho. The nearest step free tube station is Tottenham Court Road. Other nearby tube stations are Oxford Circus, Leicester Square or Piccadilly Circus, which are not step free. From any of these tube stations its about a 10 minute walk to the theatre. There are no buses that go through Soho, but there are several buses that stop nearby, but these are on Oxford Street or Shaftsbury Avenue both of which can be very busy.  There are accessible toilets on the ground, second and third floors. There is no accessible toilet on the same floor as the Downstairs venue.   I used the third floor accessible toilet, by the Upstairs venue. There was a manual door through to the toilet area and then a separate manual door to the accessible toilet. The toilet was very spacious, clean and tidy. There were grab rails and an emergency cord that hung towards the floor.  On the wall of the accessible toilet was a A4 sign saying ""Soho Theatre pull cord for help, bell will sound, help will arrive and enter at your request"". I haven't seen this before but it is excellent as the person pulling the cord knows what to expect. The only slight problem with it is that it is on the wall, at head height behind the toilet, so if I was sitting on the toilet and was unable to transfer I wouldn't be able to read the sign."
sol y sombra tapas bar dundee,negative,"There is a disabled toilet on the access level of Sol Y Sombra however it is quite small. There is no changing place toilet though. Down at the beach in Broughty Ferry there is a changing place although, it is only open till 5pm in the Summer and 3:30pm in the Winter."
sol y sombra tapas bar dundee,positive,"A council car park with disabled spaces is nearby, as well as other car parks/on street parking close by and taxi rank is also nearby. There are also plenty of buses that pass through Broughty Ferry on regular basis. A train station is also situated in Broughty Ferry although I don’t know anything about how often they stop, I know it’s not that much though."
solent conference centre southampton,positive,"The Spark Building is about a 20 minute walk from Southampton Central Railway Station. I was staying nearby at Jury's Inn which was a 2 minute level walk away.  There was an accessible toilet, not locked, on the lower ground floor where my conference was held. It was quite spacious, clean, with grab rails and emergency cord, see photo."
solihull solihull,negative,"Plain down to earth toilets, clean enough but just basic."
solihull solihull,positive,"We suggest the main Touchwood car park, but a little costly, minimum of £2.50, or  have a cup of coffee at the Crowne Plaza, REGISTERING YOUR CAR AT RECEPTION DESK, and walk across through the gardens to Touchwood shops. Mind you, it is hard work for your carer this way, it’s uphill, round and round gardens with a huff and a puff on the way, but it’s cost free, well, not really because you have had to enjoy a decent cup of coffee at the hotel."
somerset house london,positive,"Reasonable sized toilet with all the grab rails etc and the toilet is separate from the main toilets so it can be less busy, but there is no radar key so it gets used by anybody Blue Badge holders can arrange to park within the complex by prior notice. Information is available on the website."
sommerbad kreuzberg berlin,positive,Raised toilet Wash basin and shower all in one  Clean and tidy Space for 2
son of steak nottingham,negative,There isn't any parking as its in the center but car parks close by.
son of steak nottingham,positive,"There is a multistory car park around the back that you need to pay for and there is on road disabled bays right next to the same carpark that are free. Nothing out the ordinary Great toilet, suitable for my walker and to aid me."
sondheim theatre london,positive,"Busses stop all along Shaftesbury Av. Taxis can pull up nearby. Large, easily accessed well appointed toilet. Yes, slightly too small but not worth complaining about Perfectly doable on a bus.  A member of staff appeared at the interval to take us to the toilet. The space in the loo wasn't great for manoeuvring around but was clean and tidy.  From the restrictions of a theatre in london, the accessible toliet was fine easily fit a wheelchair if needed."
sonny vitos deli cafe glasgow,negative,Close to public transport and some on road parking nearby Not huge but clean and tidy  and without storage of various other bits of restaurant equipment
sound bites derby,positive,Close to Derby bus station.
souq edinburgh,negative,"Don't know about parking - probably pay & display on side streets?  Loads of buses along South Clerk St.  Taxi can stop right outside. I wouldn't call it accessible, but they've done what they can - a dozen or so steps down, then a 90 degree turn and a few more steps down to the door to the loos (and another area with further tables).  On the way down the stairs you can check out some of the goods for sale - i picked up a lovely Moroccan bowl.  Stairs are metal with a textured surface which helps your feet grip. Chunky banister right down - poss. both sides? Definitely on left though.  The accessible loo itself had plenty of room for me - although of course I'd had to leave the scooter upstairs!"
souq edinburgh,positive,"At the moment there is significant gas work, resurfacing going on which will affect much of South Edinburgh, especially Newington.  Car parking is even more limited and there are temporary bus stops in other places, this is a very busy main road, the bus service is provided by 3 companies with 19 routes. The City Bus Service is considered one of the most frequent, until 19.00 there is one in either direction every 2m. Large and fully equipped."
south devon railway buckfastleigh,negative,"Only tried the one at Totnes. Very difficult to use due to a sloped entry, door that only half opens and small space. Not really wheelchair accessible. Buckfastleigh may have better facilities."
south devon railway buckfastleigh,positive,A few accessible bays at Buckfastleigh but the better option is probably drop off as the parking is down a hill/road.  
south hill park arts centre bracknell,positive,"Good parking with Blue Badge parking only a short walk from the entrance. The  main car park, however, is a little further walk away. On a bus route. Easily accessible disabled toilet."
south mainland swimming pool shetland,positive,"Fantastic accessible parking directly in front of the entrance to the swimming. The toilets had everything I needed. There is a large changing table which can be brought down from the wall and plenty of grab rails etc, as well as a ceiling hoist. "
south pier blackpool,negative,There is no parking in this area the nearest Car park is a good ten minutes or so away. However the Tram service stops outside next to the venue and the bus stop is also near as well We found one accessible toilet this was at the back of the amusement arcade. If you go in the back door it is on the left hand side the door is hidden by  machines but you should be able to find it.  It can be opened with a radar key and is also the baby change facility as well
south tyrol museum of archaeology bolzano,negative,"I only saw one - which I used, it is by the front door and very accessible.  A decent size and well appointed."
south walney nature reserve barrow in furness,positive,there is a disabled toilet in reserve.
southampton central railway station southampton,positive,The railway station is in Southampton city centre and there are many train lines that stop here.
southampton pride southampton,positive,"I don't know about parking as I don't drive, but there were bus stops within a 2-minute walk of the location and a train station (Southampton Central - or 'So Proud Central' as it was called that day) less than a 10-minute walk away. It's worth a shout-out to Southampton City Council here, all busses had a fully functioning audible announcement function on board, meaning that I knew exactly where I was and I knew exactly when my stop was coming up. Southampton is the first city I've seen this work well in.  There was a mobiloo on site, available via a ramp on the lower level of the park area. there was also an accessible porta-loo with a ramped entrance and a fairly large space. What I really liked was that all other toilets ('non accessible' toilets, for want of a better word) were unisex, therefore I didn't have to worry whether I was going into the right one or not. A great bonus for a blind / VI person! "
southbank centre london,negative,"Difficult to open the doors as close to the main door on level 2 females toilet. If you pick your time right you'll be fine getting (no radar key needed) and there is ample space to manoeuvre around. There are disabled access toilets with grab rails. I went to two different toilets while I was there. The toilets are not clearly signposted and I was a bit confused as the sign outside had 2 people with walking sticks, which I hadn't seem before. No radar key needed but trying to close the door was quite fiddly to a line the lock with the door frame. In both toilets the disabled alarm cord didn't reach the floor."
southbank centre london,positive,"Parking for blue badge holders is free and plentiful in the Hayward Gallery car park, adjacent to Festival Hall. No need to register or take your ticket to the box office....just display your blue badge. There are also four disabled spaces on Belvedere Road immediately outside Southbank Centre, with no time limit. Plenty of space. No radar key needed. The accessible toilet on level one is usually very dirty as it's used by everyone. Didn't use it - parked on the road but easy access from car park and road to venue I travelled by public transport. The nearest tube is Waterloo (very appropriate for Abba). Waterloo tube has some step free access but it depends which line and entrance you use. The Jubilee Line at Waterloo via Waterloo Hall entrance is step free with lift access between street and platform. And the Bakerloo Line via York Road entrance also. For all other options please check with TFL (Transport for London) website. Several buses stop nearby on Waterloo Bridge but there is a set of stairs to walk down. However the RV1 bus stops nearer to the entrance and exiting here avoids the stairs.  A Changing Places toilet is located very close to the exhibition entrance, on level 1, next to the JCB Glass Lift. However their website says that the key for this room is available from the Welcome Hub, Level 2, Royal Festival Hall. There are accessible toilets on each floor. I didn't use the facilities on this occasion. The parking is free once you've register with them and there is always space...! I travelled there and back by taxi. The cab dropped me off outside the Royal Festival Hall on Belvedere Road. Where I was dropped off I had to walk across a wide paved area to reach the building. "
southend pier southend on sea,positive,We parked further along the promenade. There are loads of spaces nearby including Blue Badge spaces. It gets fairly busy so you might have to drive round for a while! We used the loos further down the promenade - faby stripey ones that say they've just opened.
southpour edinburgh,positive,"While parking is not the best in this neighbourhood, public transport is excellent. There are regular accessible Lothian buses that pass right by the restaurant, and the area has plenty of dropped kerbs at road crossings. It's within close walking distance of the university. The loo was fine, an adequate size, no mirror (a bug bear of mine).  You have to squeeze by the fire extinguishers which are situated on the floor outside the entrance towards the loo. The taxi had enough space to park outside the main entrance Good size 'Easy Access' loo."
southside community centre edinburgh,negative,It’s behind the venue  Two spaces can be available with forward planning on a bus route bus stops nearby They need to keep the area around the loo free of equipment. 
southside community centre edinburgh,positive,"Loads of buses on this street which is really handy. Can't say much about parking as I don't have a car. I walked here from the Pleasance Courtyard where I had been watching other shows. One right hand toliet and showers it has grab rails Some on-street, single yellow parking available immediately outside."
southside scran edinburgh,positive,We drove to the bistro and parked just outside after the bus stop.we went on a Thursday evening but it may be more difficult at different times of the day and different days of the  week. There are also  several buses which stop near to the venue.   There is a disabled toilet. 
southwark cathedral london,negative,"Being in the heart of the community the Cathedral is easily accessible by public transport. I arrived having come of the Jubilee Line tube at London  Bridge. Not too far to wheel along to the Cathdral. The lock now works. But there are two big clinical waste bins, a sanitary bin but no regular bins for hand towels in a very small space. It's an odd shape and there wasn't space to turn my wheelchair around inside it. The door opens onto the busy entrance way, which is awkward as tourists grab the door pulling the handrail out of your grip as you're trying to get out, then crowd around you. It's somewhat embarrassing. This has happened four times now. London Bridge Station is nearby and has step-free access to both Northern and Jubilee Lines, but check before you travel because the lifts are damned unreliable and often out of service for months at a time. Several bus routes pass up and down nearby Borough High St. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area. The accessible toilet is good in many ways, but it's an odd shape, and there are two monstrous bins blocking much of the turning space, so it's extremely difficult to manoeuvre and transfer to the toilet - amazingly thoughtless. See my picture. In addition, the toilet is not lockable from the inside: the RADAR locking mechanism is *broken*. When the inner door handle is in the raised, i.e. ""locked"" position, nobody should be able to get in from outside. I was very angry when someone burst in on me when I had my trousers down. They really need to fix this broken lock - disgraceful!"
southwark cathedral london,positive,"There are two accessible toilets. I used the one off the covered walkway which was spacious, clean and easy to access. Particular thanks to the steward who pointed the way and helped with the door. Good access from London Bridge station. From the Tooley Street exit, it's easiest to cross the road and head under London Bridge, which takes you to the accessible entrance through the cafe or learning centre. Nearest tube station is London Bridge, which has lift access between street and platform.  There are also a number of buses that stop close by on London Bridge itself or in Borough High Street. From there it is a few minutes walk. This is the first time I have used the café since becoming disabled. The regular toilets are downstairs so I asked where their accessible toilet was. I was directed to the main building and from there saw a sign to the disabled toilets. While the route was step free it involved walking along a corridor to the entrance of the cathedral. The toilet requires a radar key. The accessible toilet was clean, spacious, there's grab rails, an emergency code which almost reached to the ground. There was also a fold down baby changing table.  I didn't realise until I came home and looked in their online copy of Access for People with Special Needs that there is a second toilet, accessible by lift, which may or may not have been nearer."
southwark playhouse london,positive,"The two nearest tube stations both have limited accessibility.  Elephant and Castle tube station only has step free access on the southbound Northern line. Borough tube has step free access northbound. Both stations are about a 5 minute walk away from the theatre. There are a number of bus routes that stop close by the theatre. On the ground floor there was an accessible toilet which was identifiable with a sign on its door. The toilet was spacious and clean, with grab rails and an emergency cord."
southwold pier southwold,positive,"There is a large public car park adjacent to the pier, with a number of spaces for blue badge users. We did not use toilets on the pier, but there is an accessible public toilet with rails close by in the car park next to the pier entrance, accessed by a RADAR key.

specsavers opticians elgin,positive,There are a few car parks near Specsavers which are all around about a 5-minute walk away with lots of disabled parking spots available.  There is no parking available directly in front of the shop due to the area being pedestrianized. Which may make it unsuitable for some people with disabilities. The area surrounding Specsavers is very wheelchair accessible as all of the pavements are flat although the bumpy stone paving in between might gie yi a sare bum lol. The nearest bus station is about a 5-minute walk from Specsavers outside St Giles shopping centre where there is a disabled toilet which can be accessed using a radar key or by asking staff for access. The nearest train is about a 15-minute walk away and is beside Asda where a disabled toilet can be found either in Asda or at the train station.

specsavers opticians rotherham,negative,"The shop is in a pedestrian area, but near a road. There are some disabled parking spaces nearby, but often full. Public transport stops are fairly near, but probably not close enough for anyone walking with difficulty."
spencer arms chapel brampton,negative,"Number of spaces not clear. I parked in a space marked with a wheelchair logo on the end of a row full of cars. How many other spaces where marked I could not tell as they where just normal spaces. Just white markings and no extra space at the sides so without looking under the parked cars I could not tell the number. But a very large car park for a Pub so likely to be able to get ""on the end of a row if the space is needed."
spencer arms chapel brampton,positive,"Full sized disabled toilet room, normal height toilet, fixed and fold down rails. Plenty of space to transfer  from wheelchair. Access to toilet via raised floor area approx 4"" above main floor level. Staff produced small ramp as soon as location of toilet was mentioned. Ramp was a GRP door step type, exactly the correct height but only about 30"" wide."
spianada corfu,positive,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced.
spice indian cuisine hamilton,positive,Plenty of parking both front ant rear of the resteraunt with easy access to a ramp that does not have too much of an incline. Very clean toilets with enough room for a wheelchair and carer. Have never taken the power chair which may be a wee bit tighter to manoeuvre.

sportscotland national centre inverclyde largs,negative,"The centre is quite difficult to reach via public transport. It is accessible via bus however if you are traveling some distance it is better to travel by car.  There are disabled parking spaces within the centre car park. There are plenty of accessible toilets throughout the centre. The toilets are not yet at changing places standards, although there are plans to upgrade to this in the near future. I was disappointed to see that the changing bed in the toilet was not height adjustable and was too high to allow a wheelchair user to transfer independently. Each toilet has an emergency red cord and plenty of space to move about in a wheelchair, as well as grab rails. The accessible changing rooms also have wet floor showers with grab rails  and a changing bench. "
sportscotland national centre inverclyde largs,positive,"Toilets are very spacious with lots of room to move around. The toilets have hoists, showers and  adult changing benches. At the moment the centre is awaiting height adjustable changing benches to be classified as changing places toilets."

sse arena belfast,negative,"Very busy car park, you need to arrive early to get blue badge parking"
sse arena belfast,positive,Disabled parking bays are available in the main car park closest to the building. The car park operates on a first come first served basis only for all parking spaces. Blue badge holders must display their blue badges at all times whilst parked. The nearest designated bay is 100m (109yd) from the main entrance. The route from the car park to the entrance is accessible to a wheelchair user with assistance. Assistance may be required because there is / are slopes/ramps. The car park surface is tarmac. There is a dropped kerb / non stepped access from the car park to the venue.
st abbs harbour eyemouth,negative,They are there but I didn't use them.
st aidans dunes seahouses,negative,Park on roadside at St. Aidan's.  No designated bays. Uneven surface. Free.
st albans cathedral saint albans,negative,The disabled toilet is in the main Cathedral. The doorway is narrow so it is just big enough to fit a wheelchair in with a carer following in behind. There are handrails throughout the toilets with low-down sinks for convenience.
st albans cathedral saint albans,positive,There are two disabled parking spaces outside the Cathedral which can be accessed from the main road. The disabled entrance is adjacent to these parking spaces.
st andrews aquarium saint andrews,negative,Did not check out the toilets.
st andrews botanic garden st andrews,negative,Parked in the one disabled bay that we could see in the carpark directly outside the entrance Looking was easy to find being cafe but very narrow entrance and difficult to get in with a wheelchair. Reasonable cleanliness.

st andrews farmhouse cheese company anstruther,negative,There is a disabled loo but it doesn't have a sign on the door so you have to hunt for it!
st andrews farmhouse cheese company anstruther,positive,Blue badge parking right outside door with hard standing so easy to walk with sticks or use a wheelchair.
st andrews ladies putting club st andrews,negative,"There was no toilet, the only one you can use is within the clubhouse"
st andrews links clubhouse st andrews,negative,The accessible loo would have been fine if it hadn't had 2 nappy bins in it! I pointed this out to the staff who were very obliging and said they'd take one out.
st andrews links clubhouse st andrews,positive,Disabled parking bays near the entrance. Unsure if it would be possible to get there on public transport. There were disabled spaces close to the venue and also a drop off pick up point It was clean on the flat near the restaurant and reception. Only problem was that it opened on to an area where people queued so might be awkward if people were across the corridor.
st annes parish church edinburgh,negative,No parking bus stop about 30 seconds away
st annes pier lytham saint annes,negative,There is a small car park in front of the pier with 2 Blue badge spaces available however these were in use on badges on display. There is public transport however this is about 5mins walk away out at the main cross roads as you leave the pier  There is one wheelchair toilet this is to the left as you come up the ramp radar key will open the door outwards good basic toilet but no room for care giver if required could have been cleaner as well
st audries park taunton,negative,"Parking in site has the main behind house in courtyard with disabled next to disabled room, and if that fills up, outside entrance to main building is generic parking. So if you have no power issues, lots of space.  Although the main toilets under and behind main stairs were lovely and large and wide (ladies), I think to allow formal dresses, it is worth phoning to check latest info, or latest review."
st audries park taunton,positive,There was specific access for disabled people but we immediately had to contented with cobble stones!  The car parking was right next to the special disabled room The toilet was in a special wet room in my room whivh was fine
st brides spa hotel saundersfoot,negative,We drove. 3 disabled spaces at an angle and not really wide enough. Not enough space between each one to fully open door.

st columba hotel isle of iona,positive,There was an excellent disabled  access toilet immediately across the corridor from our dining room. There was plenty of room inside for my mobility scooter and carer
st cuthberts parish church edinburgh,negative,I'm told there is an accessible toilet. I didn't use it so cannot comment further.
st cuthberts parish church edinburgh,positive,There are several buses that stop very nearby. There is an accessible toilet with grab rails but no emergency cord. It is spacious and clean. Visitors who want to drive and have Blue Badges can park adjacent to the main entrance. Buses pass along Princes Street and Lothian Road. Approaching from these roads does require negotiating steps. If you are wheeling there you need to approach from Kings Stable Road which is off Lothian Road. It's about 150m from the road to the entrance.
st davids hall cardiff,negative,The venue itself has no parking as it is located in a pedestrian precinct but there is accessible multi-storey parking very near. Level 3 has one disabled toilet inside the main toilets and it is difficult to access.  There is one on level 2 which is easy to access but a nuisance if you have to go down in the lift to use it and back up to the auditorium. We parked at the st David's car park and made the mistake of going to the wrong location as the sat nav sent us out of the shopping centre. The hall is in the shopping centre. Follow the signs to shopping and it's a short walk to the venue. It needed better sign posting realistically
st davids hall cardiff,positive,"There is a car park called St David’s very close to the Hall, it has a whole floor dedicated to disabled and mother and child parking. Because this is in Cardiff there is a train station and buses, plenty of taxis so it has a good network of public transport and accessing the venue is not difficult. A little confusing is the two disabled toilets are within the female toilets, I am sure it’ll be the same for the male toilets. I knew this due to my last visit and the people attending the loo just let me and my carer straight into the loo area so I could access the toilet.  "
st davids shopping centre cardiff,positive,"Lots of disabled spaces in car park (fee). Shop mobility  in car park. Clean, well designed accessible toilets on both floors.  Changing Place facility available."
st enoch centre glasgow,negative,Managed to get a parking space but had extreme difficulty in getting one.
st enoch christmas market at st enoch square glasgow,positive,"The toilet facilities are in the nearby Center from the outside, accessible by ramps and lifts, there was visible fordirection and location. Radar key accessible, with a Euan's Guide red cord card visible. Fully equipped toilet, though as with the vast majority no pegs to hang a jacket of coat."
st enoch shopping centre glasgow,positive,The Centre has an accessible toilet. It has a RADAR lock. It is spacious and well appointed.
st georges church hall dumfries,positive,"I attended by wheelchair taxi, but plenty of parking outside the venue, and street parking, although no dedicated disabled parking spaces available outside venue. However as this is in the town centre parking spaces are soon taken up, so allow time to find a space. Public transport bus stop 5 minutes away, but quite a distance with no resting places, for those with mobility problems"
st giles cathedral edinburgh,negative,"The Royal Mile is narrow and pedestrianised near the Church, blue badge holders can park in Parliament Square and Carers and their vehicles can park with permission of the Church. Although being in the old town, bus routes and services are every 12 minutes, in any direction near the Church, Lothian buses have higher ratios of Disabled and mobility spaces than any bus carrier in the UK, with droplevel suspension, and electric ramps, exit bells are at levels for disable passengers and have a particular sound to alert the driver and other passengers. There is a toilet in the Visitor Team block available but not signed or equipped and is small. No wheelchair access (down a few steps at SE corner of building). Could be a problem if you are there for a service or concert which lasts for some time. I don't know of any wheelchair-accessible toilets in the vicinity."
st giles shopping centre elgin,negative,"The toilets were pretty cramped, and basic.  It is accessed using a radar key and the emergency pull cord was tied up. Also, the walkway to the toilets was  not in good condition and had been stuck down in places with hazard tape. I never used the toilet but they were well signposted."
st giles shopping centre elgin,positive,I parked in the St Giles centre multi story car park and from the car park you have signposts directing you to the centre. 
st guenole penmarch,positive,Plenty of parking on a dusty gravel flat area. 
st james park newcastle upon tyne,negative,"On the 1st floor via lift, adequate facilities. The only negative was there was no paper towels or hand dryer"
st james park newcastle upon tyne,positive,"I let the train take the strain.  Close to our seats. Clean. Radar key. Although we hadn't acquired a stadium wheelchair space, we were able to find suitable parking in close proximity to the stadium thanks to the stadium's city centre location.  Stewards readily available to guide you to the ample number of well attended-to disabled loo's. Having your own Radar Key is handy but stewards in attendance will guide you to the nearest kiosk should you need to borrow a key.  Just above the Metro St James. Two public car parks across the road. "
st james quarter edinburgh,positive,I came via bus that stopped at Princes St so cannot comment on the parking situation. However I believe their website has guidance on Blue Badge users who park there. I used the accessible toilet on one of the lower floors. This wasn’t signed posted as clearly as I’d like but it was accessible inside. Grab rails were in a good place and the Red Cord was hanging to the floor which is great. There is a Changing Places toilet on the ground floor but I could not find this on this occasion.
st jamess park london,positive,You can enter St James Park from different directions. It is a short walk from Buckingham Palace and from Palace of Westminster - so there are lots of convenient transport options.  There is no parking in the park. An accessible toilet is adjacent to the main toilets in the centre of the park. Near to the Marlborough Gate entrance accessible toilet is accessed using a RADAR key.
st leonards police station edinburgh,positive,"Large, spacious, accessible toilet."
st luke the evangelist glenrothes,positive,Small car park with disabled bays and bus station a five minute walk. Great accessible loo with shower.
st machars cathedral aberdeen,positive,"Can't comment on the parking, though there seemed to be a few spaces outside the churchyard. A number 20 bus from the city centre gets you quite close. The pavement by the nearest stop in High St is v narrow. Best to get off at Dunbar Street, walk back along St Machar's Drive and turn right along the Chanonry. Pavement narrow & a bit bumpy but manageable. From the Dunbar At bus stop to the Cathedral is about 7 minutes wheel/walk."
st marks battersea rise london,negative,"There are two parking spaces right by the church, but no reservation system - get there early. There is also on-street parking nearby, which also fills up early. There are plenty of bus stops nearby, though a slight slope on Battersea Rise to get from the bus stop to the church."
st marks battersea rise london,positive,"Easy to find, enough room to turn around, grab bars are good. Red cord is often tied up as baby changing is also in there."
st martins theatre london,positive,"The nearest accessible tube is Tottenham Court Road which is now step free for both the Central and Northern lines. The Elizabeth Line aka Crossrail will also stop at the station when it opens. There are several buses that stop a couple of minutes walk away from the theatre. There is an adapted toilet at dress circle level, an staff will assist with access, but I didn't use this. There is one toilet cubicle on the foyer level which is not accessible which I used."
st marys battersea london,negative,"Parking spaces available in the church yard, but having to go round three sides of the church is a nuisance, particularly for someone with a walking stick. Bus stops nearby. Not enough room for my chair to turn around, so I had to back out."
st marys episcopal cathedral edinburgh,negative,"Allocated bays at front entrance No room for wheelchair in disabled toilet, had to use the whole womens toilet area with the main door shut."
st marys episcopal cathedral edinburgh,positive,"The church has no designated parking, but there is a single yellow line out front where we were able to park for quick access."

st marys stadium southampton,positive,Plenty. Radar locked. Clean.
st michaels church hamburg,positive,"Accessible toilet by the disabled entrance.  Small, and a tight fit for the mobility scooter, but it was possible.  Grab rails.  I was just impressed they had anything!"
st michaels parish church linlithgow,positive,"Linlithgow always feels gridlocked with traffic when I visit. The narrow main street is busy, and the car parks are often full. There are regular buses through the town though, and there is accessible parking near the church. I'd recommend parking as near to the church as you can as the church is up  fairly steep, although not unmanageable, hill."
st mirren football club and conference centre paisley,positive,Plenty of Accessible parking with 8 spaces available to away supporters Accessible toilets are available in every stand throughout the stadium and also within the conference centre and also the team changing rooms
st moritz hotel saint moritz villas,positive,"Disabled parking right outside reception and near to rooms. Given 4 stars purely because the 2 spaces provided might prove to be inadequate at busier times in Cornwall. January is not peak season after all and both spaces were in use ( one by us , I hasten to add)"
st nicholas cafe scarborough,negative,could not even get in the building
st nicholas cafe scarborough,positive,very good parking nearby as it is next to a car park
st pancras international railway station london,negative,"The accessible toilets are too few and can be very busy.  Maintenance is poor. No disabled parking at London St Pancras Station.  Appalling: broken seat, red cord only reaching part way to the ground and no flush arm visible. "
st pancras international railway station london,positive,All the platforms of this station are accessible and boarding ramps are provided.  There is also step free access to the Underground and to neighbouring Kings Cross Station.  Masses of bus routes outside the station and a taxi rank on the west side of the station.
st pancras old church camden town,negative,"Kings Cross/St Pancras station is 5 minutes down the road, so tube access is good, and there are lots of bus stops nearby. I can't comment on the parking, as I arrived by bus."
st pauls and st georges edinburgh,negative,"No close proximity parking - good bus services out side the door. Also, soon to be opened tram stop."
st pauls and st georges edinburgh,positive,"An accessible toilet is adjacent to the main space of church. Fitted with grab rails, has space to turn, and is clean and tidy. Another accessible toilet is located in the lower floor area."
st pauls cathedral london,positive,"There are a number of accessible buses that stop outside or very close to St Paul's. The closest tube station is St Paul's, but it is not step free. The nearest step free tube stations are Blackfriars, this will involve going up Ludgate Hill, and Farringdon, which if you go via Smithfield Market, you can have a flat route. Recently their accessible toilets in the crypt have been upgraded, see photo. They are spacious with grab rails and emergency cords. There is step free access via a lift. There area number of accessible buses that stop outside or very close to St Paul's. The closest tube station is St Paul's, but it is not step free. The nearest step free tube stations are Blackfriars, this will involve going up Ludgate Hill, and Farringdon, which if you go via Smithfield Market, you can have a flat route. I didn't use them on this occassion but I have done previously. The accessible toilets are in the crypt and are accessible by the lift. They are a cubicle located inside the ladies or gents toilets. They clean and have grab rails. "
st pauls cathedral paternoster square,positive,"The Cathedral is in the heart of the city and parking is limited. Buses, taxis, and the nearby underground provide accessible options for getting to the Cathedral. There is an accessible toilet in the Crypt area adjacent to the cafe and shop. It's not easy to see but is alongside the standard toilets. Staff were happy to give directions when asked. The accessible toilet is not large but is well equipped, clean and tidy. Great. We were coming from Southbank so just crossed over the river. Lots of public transport options nearby. not sure about Blue Badge parking."
st pauls centre worthing,positive,"There is no parking as it's in the centre of town,  but there are public car parks within 5 minutes walk, and a Pulse bus stop within 25m. The accessible loo is easy to find,  and is clean but - usual story - it also doubles as a baby changing room, and as the venue is very popular with young mothers it can sometimes whiff a bit."
st peters church derby,positive,Close to wheelchair accessible bus network. Disabled badge holder on street parking is available near the venue. 
st stephens green dublin,positive,A number of accessible buses stop nearby but I used my scooter from the hotel I stayed at a mile or so away. Most of the roads (and indeed sites) within dublin are fully accessible so getting here is no problem. There is a multistorey car park with a number of disabled spaces nearby and there are also numerous parking spaces in surrounding roads.
st stephens hull,negative,"There are two toilets that offer 'Changing Places', which provide additional space and facilities, such as a hoist and a changing table. One of these are placed on the toilet corridor which is easily accessible from the main shopping centre, and the other is on the ground floor by Tesco's car park.   One main criticism in terms of the toilets is that for them to be accessed you have to call a manager, whose number is on the door, or where available press the intercom. However, this is not suitable and could appear confusing for someone who is blind or cannot read. Additionally, if someone is in desperate need of the toilet this is not appropriate and could result in an accident. "
st stephens hull,positive,"On the ground floor there is one changing places loo & 2 regular disabled access loos. These are clearly signposted. I love that to access these toilets you need a radar key, so there is less chance of the facilities being abused by people who don't need them. The disabled access loos are on the way to the regular loos, which is great as you can 'walk' to the loos with the person you've gone with, rather have to find a separate  facility. On this visit there was a queue so I did have to wait a few minutes. There was a cleaner/attendant outside monitoring the loos & they were able to unlock the door for a wheelchair user who didn't have a radar key with them. When she beckoned me over to the first free cubicle for me to use, I got in there to discover that there was feaces on the toilet seat so I turned straight round & went out. The attendant asked what was wrong & I said the toilet seat is.... & before I could think of a polite way to describe what i'd seen, she said ""messy?"" Yes! Messy, thank you, and she went straight in there and cleaned it very thoroughly & without fuss! The toilets while not massive, are big enough for me to turn around in my powerchair. There was plenty of loo roll & the soap dispenser had soap in. The hand drier was super quick too.  There are 22 reserved parking spaces for disabled customers.  There is free use of wheelchairs offered for the period of your duration at the shopping centre. Mobility scooters are also available, as the centre works in partnership with Travel Extra Mobility Service. For more information about the hiring, there is information on the website https://www.ststephens-hull.com/  "
st vincent arms york,positive,"Car park available. If informed at point of booking, the staff at the St. Vincent Arms will ensure their is a space infront of the gates for easy access to the back of the pub. "
stack newcastle newcastle upon tyne,positive,"Being in the city centre parking is not available directly outside the venue but there are many car parks in the city.  The Metro in only 3-5 minutes away by wheelchair, scooter or foot - Monument is the station to use, although scooters are not allowed in the station unless folded up and pulled along. Lots of buses stop outside on Pilgrim street and the surrounding streets such as Blacket street, too many to list.   There is an accessible lift to the upper floor and a disabled toilet upstairs which appeared to be clean with plenty of room to manoeuvre. There are moveable grab rails and space for a carer."
stack still glasgow,positive,"There is a fully accessible bathroom located on the main floor of the restaurant. This was a spacious, clean and well sign posted. The helpful staff are available to provide directions to the bathroom if you miss the sign postings."
stade de france saint denis,negative,"The disabled toilets are by the lifts so they are easy to find, however annoyingly lots of people who weren't disabled could also find them easily, meaning I had to wait to use the toilet. The layout of the toilets was strange, there were no grab rails if you need them and they were also dirty. It was not what you would expect of a relatively new ground, I was not impressed! The disabled toilets were no different. They are by the lifts so they are easy to find, however annoyingly lots of people who weren't disabled could also find them easily, meaning I had to wait to use the toilet. The layout of the toilets was strange, there were no grab rails if you need them and they had not been cleaned properly since my first visit. I can't imagine them changing any time soon, not good!"
stade de france saint denis,positive,"The parking at the Stade de France is good. It is complicated to drive to due to the road closures around the stadium but eventually you reach P4, which is the disabled parking area. To request parking there you need to ring up the ticketing service for the event you are about to watch a few weeks before traveling to the stadium - in our case it was UEFA. Once you have done this you are free to park in the available blue badge spots. If there is no space left when you arrive there is an overflow car park across the road, specifically for the disabled and the fire brigade! The parking at the Stade de France is good.

stagecoach carlisle,positive,"We regularly travel along the route of the 555 .   Nearest loo to Kendal bus station is in the Westmorland centre, last time I visited I needed my RADAR key. In Windermere there is a nice disabled loo in Booths."
stalls lifestyle stratford upon avon,negative,"A small car park, difficult to park, driving over a chipping driveway, with no disabled bay.  It is on the level, but basic toilet, very clean and well looked after. We saw no grab rails or pull cord"
stanbrook abbey hotel worcester,negative,"The accessible toilet is on the level, very clean as you would expect, but limited space in there. It has grab rails and pull cord. (Photo 12) The is a disabled toilet just a few feet away from reception, on the level, and we found another along the level towards the church itself. Both are basic, you will perhaps get your chair in them, I personally had to get up and walk into them both, not on same day by the way, so if you can stand and take a few steps you will be ok. They had pull cords and grab rails. If you read both part one and part two, then photos will help you decide if you can use them, or keep crossing your legs. Both  toilets were of course very clean and well looked after."
stanbrook abbey hotel worcester,positive,"It’s a delightful approach towards Two disabled bays right by front entrance, which has automatic doors, and is on the level. Disabled may park right outside the hotels main entrance, (photo 1) and it’s on the level as you enter the lovely reception area, with wide, polished, carefully selected furnishings, that immediately appeal (photo 2) It is situated right by the main restaurant, with a ramp if needed, and although toilet is quite small, you have to leave wheelchair along corridor by its door, it is always very clean and well maintained, with grab handle. It’s always a delight to arrive here passing through the gateway, and along well maintained grounds to reach a wonderful looking abbey. Disabled will love the easy parking here, two bays close to entrance, and if these are taken, you may park next to them anyway. Following along a lovely driveway towards the hotel, passing open pastureland, you arrive at the disabled bays right outside the main entrance into hotel, and it’s all easy and on the level into the reception area."
stanley green infant academy poole,negative,"Two dedicated disabled bays, out of sight of the main reception area and unmonitored. There is a disabled toilet but this requires a trek in to the school to an area occupied by the newest and youngest students."
stanley park blackpool,positive,We arrived by bus to the East Park Drive side of the park. The bus was wheelchair accessible. There were plenty of entrances dotted around the park and several of these had parking nearby.
starbeck library harrogate,positive,Excellent parking faccilities 
starbucks aberdeen,positive,"Lots of accessible parking bays in Union square car park. The centre is attached to Aberdeen train station and is in the city centre, so lots of bus routes available."
starbucks cleethorpes,negative,No parking facilities. There is some limited double yellow line parking space which you can use with a blue badge but the dropped curb isn't near and if you need your wheelchair on the passenger side it's quite difficult. If the cinema is open there is some normal parking spaces but not accessible parking so you'd need to find a space with no cars on the side you need the wheelchair. The accessible toilet today was out of order and there's only one. From past experience of going there was grab rails and enough room (just) to manouver my wheelchair. There would be enough room for a carer I think. The emergency red cord was tied up. I had to use the normal toilet today and it was clean.
starbucks dundee,positive,"There are about 4 accessible parking spaces outside Starbucks. I’m not too sure where the closest bus stops are but, there are buses that come from the city centre of Dundee. The train station is about a 10/15 minute drive away. I would say the accessible toilet is the best thing at this Starbucks. It is very spacious, clean and the emergency red cord was hanging freely. Although you can only really transfer on to the toilet at the right-hand side because it is nearer the wall at the other side. The only thing would be is that the doors were quite heavy to open, there was a toilet to get into the main toilet area and then a door to get into the accessible toilet.  I’m not sure where the closest Changing Place toilet is. "
starbucks eastgate shopping centre inverness,positive,Parking in the Eastgate centre carpark. Decent sized accessible loo - it's just quite tight to get round to it.
starbucks edinburgh,negative,"I am unaware of parking facilities as I came by bus. The 35 bus heading into the city stops outside. There is a slight incline going up this way.  I came by public transport. Lothian buses 11,15,16,23,36,45 pass at Holy Corner I came by bus. Outside and across one road buses stop and its level all the way. Car parking is underground the cinema complex although I’ve never came this way so unsure of cost or accessibility this way. Okay toilet but stars took off for not being easy to find and having to get a code from staff just to get in. This code is to get to all toilets not just accessible toilet. After going through the locked door it is a long narrow corridor down to the accessible toilet and this might be tight if you have a long wheelchair. Toilet itself was nice and clean, space to turn and red cord was hanging to the floor! No easy parking but buses do go along the High Street. I travelled by powerchair but the 35 bus passes up and down Canongate. The street is on a hill. Parking situation unknown in this area. Not entirely sure as we came on foot.  There is parking behind quartermile in the streets nearby."
starbucks edinburgh,positive,"Parking spaces on nearby roads, Tesco car park behind Multiple rails, pull chord for help, plenty of space No need for RADAR key. Grab rails on both sides. Red cord touching the floor. Small sink with mirror. I could turn around in my chair 360. This is the only toilet in the venue. There is an accessible toilet at the back of the store on the left. It has a red cord to the floor and space for a wheelchair and carer. Handrails on both sides and the sink can be rolled under. The mirror is also low down Totally depends on how you get there! Parking can often be an issue in the surrounding streets. I went by bus and there are loads of stops nearby. There is an accessible loo on the ground floor which is also the baby changing. It is spacious and clean - see pic. Plenty of buses! At the back of the shop radar key The main road is incredibly well serviced by buses. There is a loading bay outside the shop where you can stop for a shorter visit (not sure if Blue Badges allow you to stay longer) and there is also a disabled parking bay just round the corner in Merchiston Avenue in the small car park. The accessible loo is at the back of the cafe on the left hand side. No parking on Royal Mile Disabled toilet situated downstairs, access granted via a radar key available from staff Spacious and easy to get to Parking in Stafford Street, round the corner. Well served by buses and the Tram. Accessible loo just past the counter on the right hand side. A good, spacious accessible toilet toward the rear of the cafe. Big with plenty of space to manoeuvre. Bus links and plenty of on street parking nearby Spacious though it was a slight oversight to put the bar so close to the toilets The accessible loo (&baby change) is at the back of the shop past the counter and drink waiting area. There is one metre between the tall counter and a wall (see pictures). This may get quite tight if busy. The toilet had space to move around in, grab rails / handles on both sides of the toilet. The sink is small but there is space to roll under it in a wheelchair. There is a red cord hanging to the floor on the ride hand side when you are on the toilet. Toilet roll is dispensed on the left hand side. General waste and nappy bins are against the wall and leave enough room to maneouver . The mirror is long which I thought was great being in a chair. Large, clean and easy to get to."
starbucks glasgow,negative,"No parking immediately at it, you may be lucky and get street-parking nearby. It is in the middle of Glasgow, so could use multi-storey car parks.  Also public transport to area - nearest train station is Queen St, though Glasgow Central not that far away. Buchanan Bus Station is also close, and underground if able to access that. During our visit, the other toilets were out of use, so all customers were using the single accessible toilet. It wasn't that clean, which may be due to it getting used by more people than usual!  The toilet had a radar key lock, but this wasn't getting used. The emergency cord was wrapped round a support handle (. . but now untied and sporting a new Euans Guide card!!)  If you need a carer, it would likely be a bit of a tight squeeze if you also had a wheelchair in there.  The toilet is also the baby changing facility. It is sauchiehall street, so parking is not really an option, is next to traffic lights, meaning one can be dropped off.  Buchanan Street is a pedestrian area. There are nearby bus links and stations."
starbucks glasgow,positive,"There's an accessible loo to the rear of the store. Good accessible loo. Plenty of room to turn, grab rails and clean and tidy."
starbucks inverness,positive,"There is disabled parking available throughout the retail park including at the door of the New Look store. It may not always be possible to park directly in front of the venue at the busier times but I've always found somewhere reasonably close and it was not a problem when I visited.  The retail park is on a regular bus route from Inverness and the east coast (Culloden, Nairn etc.) and the venue is about a three minute walk."
starbucks leeds,negative,"The toilet is at the back of the store, to the right of the counter. I did by use it but there is plenty of room to get to it easily."
starbucks leeds,positive,"The store is very close to the Merrion Centre car park, and there is some parking on the road. Taxi's can drop you off very close by, there are a few bus stops in the vicinity, & the pavement is smooth & wide."
starbucks lincoln,positive,3 good spaces right out side the doors
starbucks london,negative,"The café is on a busy high street with little parking of any kind available. There is an accessible toilet to the rear of the coffee shop. Unusually it does not require a code to access it. Inside it is reasonably spacious with grab rails. The emergency code did not reach to the floor as it appears to have been cut. The room was clean.  Most concerning was the low level of lighting. The main light was not working and there interior room was only illuminated by a single, small bulb. I found the room very dark to be in and for people who have visual impairment it could potentially be dangerous. This is why I have given the toilet such a low score.  "
starbucks london,positive,"Full marks for this one. Enough manoeuvre room, and a separate loo for non-disabled customers which prevents having to wait. Starbucks is on the ground floor of St Pancras International Station. The nearest tube station is King's Cross and it has step free access. Several buses routes stop very close by. There is a little on street parking but bus connections are nearby as our 2 accessible tube stations. There is an accessible toilet and it is roomy however there are high chairs next to the door and you have to work through four or five tables to get to it. This branch is close to Blackfriars tube and railway station, both of which have lift access. There are also several buses which stop close by Starbucks.  Starbucks is on the ground floor of St Pancras International Station. The nearest tube station is King's Cross and it has step free access. Several buses routes stop very close by."
starbucks londonderry,positive,Lots of room and accessible aids
starbucks mold,positive,We parked in the front but there were only 2 blue badge spaces
starbucks newcastle upon tyne,negative,"I'll be honest, the drive in was a bit of a nightmare. There are roadworks and road closures everywhere and we ended up accidently driving down a bus only road (expecting a fine). There were some car parks but they looked tight. We parked street side in a disabled bay outside the Head of Steam on Broad Chare, and walked from there. That walk was flat and relatively easy but there are some places where dropped kerbs would be helpful."
starbucks newcastle upon tyne,positive,Toilets are in the hotel next door but you can go straight through from Starbucks without going outside. The hotel lobby area is thick carpeted so it was a bit like wheeling through treacle. The toilets were very clean and had sufficient grab rails for me.
starbucks norwich,negative,"The RADAR accessible toilet is often out of order. When the baby changing table is folded up there is just enough room to be able to turn in a powerchair, and a carer would be pushed for space with larger wheelchairs. The hygiene of the toilet has been variable, due to it also being a baby change facility"
starbucks norwich,positive,"The shop is located just outside of Intu Chapelfield, which has ample disabled parking spaces as well as easy access to Shopmobility. It is also located right beside some of the main bus stops."
starbucks nottingham,negative,"it's next to quite a few bus stops and there is on road disabled parking nearby, but be warned! you have to drive down a bus lane to get to them! you are allowed to do it with a blue badge but you will get a ticket and need to prove you have a valid blue badge... They've told us we're ""on the list now"" but we've had 5 tickets this year *eye roll* Please see issues in the summary"
starbucks perth,positive,"I found the toilet handy for my needs, spacious enough for me to turn round my chunky chair fully. The grab rails are sturdy but so look like they've seen better days. It was clean and tidy. No radar key needed. Would say their emergency cord has seen better days also. On-street parking close to the venue.  No parking for the venue itself and is on a pedestrian area. Inside it is very spacious and has everything you need.  It was a bit difficult to get in without assistance due to the way the door opens."
starbucks saint andrews,negative,There isn't disabled parking directly outside but within a few meters away.
starbucks sheffield,negative,"Usually parking in the city centre of Sheffield is difficult, however it is easier for people with blue disability badges"
starbucks sheffield,positive,The toilets are accessible with a ramp leading to them from the entrance of the cafe
starks park kirkcaldy,positive,This was located just inside the stand close to the wheelchair entrance. It is a good size with decent manoeuvring space.
starling independent beer and coffee house harrogate,positive,"While the venue does not have its own parking, we  were able to park in a car park which did have accessible parking areas. "
stavanger stavanger,positive,We arrived by cruise ship which was at the heart of town. We did not need local transport. 
staybridge suites liverpool liverpool,positive,Excellent. Parking with blue badge is in the hotel basement and is free for Blue Badge holders
staybridge suites newcastle newcastle upon tyne,positive,"There is a hotel car park with barrier entry and exit and several disabled parking spaces at the back of the hotel right near the hotel entrance doors. I cannot comment on public transport as I arrived by car The hotel is on a hill so it is a bit of a push in a manual chair to get down to the riverside The bathroom is very large with lots of space for manoeuvring. Roll-in shower with a wall-mounted seat, grab rails and an emergency pull cord. The toilet has a padded backrest for extra comfort.  There are both fixed and pull-down grab bars at the toilet and sink area as well as another emergency pull cord.  The toilet roll and hand towels are placed in an easy to reach position.   "
staycity serviced apartments edinburgh,positive,"For me as a visually impaired person, it was easy to get a taxi from Haymarket railway station. You can be dropped at the door as it is a quiet street.   There are local buses running along nearby streets. For drivers, there is some on site parking. StayCity Edinburgh's serviced apartments are located in a quiet side street in the Fountainbridge area of the city. There are buses running along one of the adjacent streets and it’s only a short ten-minute walk through to Haymarket and its transport hub. It's a central location so plenty of buses nearby, 15-20  minutes rolling away from  Haymarket Station and the tram but a much longer wheel to Waverley  Station but plenty of buses nearby.  There are quite a few disabled  (chargeable) parking places onsite in a secure underground car park.  A small lift takes you upstairs from here. The wet room was modern, spacious, clean and had lots of grab rails and two red cords, sink was a great height too. "
steak cattle roll glasgow,positive,I was dropped off but there is on street parking and multistory car park close by
steam museum of the great western railway swindon,positive,"Free disabled parking 25 metres from museum. Disabled drop off. Level access from car park. Disabled toilet facilities - Fully accessible toilets, fitted with call point. Adult changing room. You drive in the turning before the Outlet car park and go up then right, to the barrier. Say you are visiting steam and they let you in. While there you can also visit the Designer Outlet.  Big room. All facilities. Including a cot sided changing table. "
steampunk coffee the warehouse north berwick,positive,Large disabled toilet on ground floor
stedelijk museum alkmaar,positive,"The accessible loo is on the ground floor. The door is wide and although the loo is relatively small there would be room for side transfer provided you moved the Hi-Tech litter bin. The toilet has grab rails, the loo paper dispenser is within reach and there's an approachable washbasin. The alarm cord is of the excellent Dutch type - it goes most of the way round the room at skirting board level."
stephansdom vienna,negative,No toilets in the building. Nearest accessible toilet is in Stefansplatz U-bahn station. Our Euro- key wouldn't work but a helpful attendant let my wife use the ladies loo.
stephansdom vienna,positive,Stefansplatz U bahn station is close by and fully accessible.
stephen joseph theatre scarborough,negative,"There are no accessible parking areas nearby. The closest is in the railway car park which is about 200m. Train and bus stops are very close. Generally these are too small and are not well laid out.  They suggest that you can park in Hanover Rd using the blue badge, but this road gets parked up very early in the evening. They also suggest the nearby Railway Station car park, but the disabled bays here specify that they are only for train users. The nearest disabled bays on Abermarle Crescent really are too far away for someone with walking difficulties. The best option for us was to drop off the disabled person  off at the theatre and then for the able bodied person to park in a nearby pay and display which are free in the evening. Not easy if travelling alone."
stephen joseph theatre scarborough,positive,"Plenty of room in toilets, fairly easy to find. All had alarms and were clean. Level access to all toilets. (Lift to first floor)"
steppes farm cottages monmouth,positive,If you can drive there the Parking is ok some on the level of the cottages some though up a hill.  There is level access into the cottages ( three are across cobbles three are paved).  I did not measure the width of the doors.  Should have .  Sorry but they seemed far narrower then the modern building reg width.
steps of rome dublin 14,negative,"Parking available 5 minutes walk away, 10 min walk from the Windy Arbour Luas"
sterling mills outlet shopping village tillicoultry,positive,Large car park with disabled spaces nearest to shops A few disabled parking spaces at the front of the store. Lots of disabled bays in the new carpark round the back - plenty of signs directing you to them. Not sure about public transport so can't comment on that. Excellent disabled toilet at the cafe. 
stewarts garden centre holt,negative,"Only really accessible by car. Given the high proportion of seniors demographically, there is need for more disabled parking spaces."
stewarts garden centre holt,positive,Located on God's Blessings Lane (don't believe your Sat Nav). Ample parking and six unmonitored disabled bays by the entrance. Loo is easy to access and very clean.
sticky sisters leeds,negative,"Sticky Sisters does not have public toilets themselves, instead directing users into the neighbouring Burger King. There is a door between the two shops as they are right next to each other. The tables in Burger King are a little narrow to move through, and the toilets are located next to the queue which can make them awkward to access for everyone at peak times. The toilet itself was a clean, large cubicle with a full length pull cord but no changing facilities apart from baby-changing facilities."
sticky sisters leeds,positive,"Sticky Sisters is next to the Merrion Centre car park which has many disabled parking spaces and lifts, and is also near a taxi drop-off point and several bus stops. The pavement is smooth and level, making pedestrian access easy to negotiate."
stirling castle stirling,positive,"Free parking for blue badge holders on the Esplanade.  Wouldn't have thought public transport would go near the castle. We went to the disabled toilet beside the great hall and it was excellent.  There are other disabled toilets but we didn't go into them I got there by car. My friend had an blue badge  and we were able to park in the top car park, the accessible spaces had all been taken but we wait a few minutes and we were shown to a reserved space which was right beside the entrance.  Showed my blue badge and was able to park on the esplanade. There was a car to take you right into the castle which is also wheelchair accessible. We arrived by car and the disabled parking was right at the entrance. It was ideal. Getting to Stirling Castle can be a bit tricky but that's more to do with the volume of visitors. If arriving by car their is a car park on the esplanade. There are several Blue Badge spaces but these do fill up quickly. There's also a regular bus service that drops people off at the esplanade.  There are accessible toilets with handrails available near the entrance to the castle  A limited car park outside the castle and a non-accessible bus to the castle from the town centre. I scooted up the long hill from the town centre, where there is plenty of parking, a bus and train station.  Fine but had to untie red cord and add a red cord card.  The car park is right near the Castle, parking is free for Blue Badge holders. If you mention the wheelchair when you get tickets, a wheelchair accessible vehicle can be provided to take you to the top of the castle. You can then make your way down and around, although it is cobble stones! Accessible toilet in the Great Hall, well signposted. Clean with plenty of space for carer On arriving the person at the car park kiosk pointed out where the disabled bays were, with blue badge holders being exempt from the parking charge."
stirling court hotel stirling,negative,While there are quite a few disabled parking spots these filled up very quickly making parking difficult. Staff at reception however found us somewhere to park until a space became available and did try to help out with this.   There is public transport to the city (bus) from very near the hotel which can be used. We also saw quite a few wheelchair accessible taxis in the area and the reception staff had information on these.
stirling court hotel stirling,positive,"There are two accessible toilets in the main part of the hotel which were spacious and well adapted.   In the hotel room the toilet had grab rails, a lower mirror and sink and emergency red cord.   The shower was a roll in shower with grab rails and shower chair. The shower could be detached making it easier for a PA to assist.  The bathroom was very large with plenty of space.  There are 3 disabled parking spaces right beside the front entrance to the hotel, although this sometimes isn’t enough. At the conference that I was attending here, there were more than 3 people who require disabled spaces and needed to park further away whilst also having to use up 2 standard parking spaces.  I am not from Stirling so don’t know about the public transport, but I did notice there was a bus stop nearby and the train station is a 10-minute drive away. The disabled toilets within the hotel are quite a standard size where a wheelchair user and assistant can fit in however, it isn’t very spacious. There is no changing place toilet in this hotel, but due to attending a conference where some attendees need hoist transfer, the hotel allowed us to use an accessible room during the day."
stirling railway station stirling,positive,"Has good parking available, room to pick up at the front and also has a busy taxis rank and very close to the bus station. Large disabled toilets in the main concourse. Disabled parking adjacent to station. Fairly level access to bus station but some of the pavement around the station can be awkward. If you book Travel Assistance then staff will have a wheelchair accessible taxi from the queue reserved for you on arrival. Accessible toilet on concourse is clearly signed and needs RADAR key.  The lighting is not very bright. The accessible toilet on platform 3 is not well signed."
stjosephs mercy secondary school an uaimh,negative,The entrance to the toilet is not wide enough and there is barely enough space to manoeuvre a wheelchair inside the toilet.
stjosephs mercy secondary school an uaimh,positive,"There are disabled parking spaces for both staff and students- approximate 5 spaces at the front entrance and three disabled parking spaces at the rear of the school. The bus stop going to nearby places such as Trim, Kells and Dublin are also located right outside the gates of the school. There are also school buses which operate in the morning and in the afternoon. These are then located within 5 mins walk of the school."
stobo castle stobo,positive,Parking beside entrance spacious toilet with separate shower and changing room
stockport centre for independent living stockport,positive,"Two disabled bays and further basement car park. Off street parking and large public car parks within 500 metres. Free shuttle bus stops outside. Approx. 1/2 mile from mainline train station and 1/4 mile to main bus station. fairly level from train station, uphill from bus station. Choice of 3 on ground floor with hoists. 1 Standard, 2x shower toilets, ceiling hoists and movable sink units. Upstairs standard accessible toilet-no hoist with all other features in place."
stockton globe stockton on tees,positive,"My carer drove me there in my own WAV. To my surprise the council have a multistorey carpark behind the theatre that is well signposted, patrolled by helpful staff and free of charge. A level well lit pedestrianised route takes the audience fdom carpark to the entrance.  I visited the disabled toilet close to my seat. It was spacious and well equipped but not a Changing Places Toilet. "
stoke court barn ludlow,positive,"This is a rural location so you will need your own transport.  This is a farm, so it can be a bit muddy.  That said, the parking is very close to the entrance of the building and if you use a vehicle ramp, you can park the vehicle in such a way that the wheelchair can descent straight onto the patio area and thus avoid going onto the muddy path.    The car park can fit several vehicles. The downstairs bathroom is a purpose built wet room and has all the accessible features you would hope to find, i.e. grab rails, shower chair and punching stool.  It also has a full length shower curtain around the shower area.  This provides, both privacy and easy accessibility for both the person with the additional needs and the carer."
stonehaven fireballs stonehaven,negative,"No designated parking, in fact my companions had to park nearly a mile away after dropping me and my companion at the drop off point, so realistically you need a group of at least 3 of you, including a fit and able driver ,if attending. The local area is supported by public transport."
stonehenge amesbury,positive,Disabled parking was easily identified near to the entrance.  Buses to and from the stonehenge from the entrance were wheelchair accessible with ramp. Easily located. Wide hand rail. Wide enough to accommodate carer
storehouse kitchen ripon,positive,"Reasonably roomy disabled toilet, at the back and with space to manoeuvre, but with some form of obstruction in the transfer space. Clean and tidy and space for a carer. "
stornoway airport stornoway,positive,"Allocated disabled parking near  entrance, drop off point in front of airport entrance Easy to find, plenty of room to access and turn wheelchair. Modern clean , plenty grabrails"
storyhouse chester,negative,Fine with a blue badge as long as places are free outside which may not always be the case in busy periods. Plenty of multi story parking nearby.
storyhouse chester,positive,Amazing. Rare changing places fully equipped toilet and other disabled toilets too. Clean at all times. Several accessible toilets that are spacious and have grab rails. A spacious changing places toilet also available.
strada cambridge,positive,"The accessible toilet is good, it's opened with a RADAR key, if you don't have one don't worry, the staff will open it for you. One star lost because there was a large waste-bin in the wheelchair transfer area, very thoughtless, this area is not free space to be cluttered up with large objects like waste-bins, it's the space where a wheelchair user parks to transfer to the toilet. "
strada canterbury,negative,"No parking close by, in the very heart of the city"
strada london,negative,"Waterloo Station is nearby and the Jubilee Line offers step-free access but beware - the Jubilee Line lift has had severe problems for months and is frequently out of service - check before you travel! A few bus routes will drop you off nearby. Really awful. First of all, the door is huge and opens in such a way that it's impossible to get into the toilet without first going through another heavy door and waiting in the corridor beyond it. Worse still the emergency cord had been tied up in a complex knot and was unusable by anyone falling to the floor. In the case of serious injury this can be a life-and-death issue. See my attached pictures. Disgraceful."
stramash edinburgh,negative,"We were sat right outside it, so easy for us to find, but although there was a sign, it was difficult to see in the dark atmosphere. The pub/ music bar was jam packed, so I would imagine this would make access difficult for other users Toilet large with plenty of grab rails, not the cleanest I have seen, but it was being frequently used. Badly let down by the red cord and it’s handle being tied up all the way to the ceiling"
stramash edinburgh,positive,"We had travelled up to Edinburgh by car, and had walked/ wheeled from our accommodation to the venue. Venue in the Old Town, there was a large carpark nearby, and observed plenty of wheelchair taxis passing"
strandpaviljoen de toko callantsoog,negative,"Accessible parking is available in the city of Calantsoog.  To access the beach by wheelchair, you need to go around the shopping areas on the north side of the street and access the beach through the road Strandslag Dorpsplein.  Some portions of the road are a bit steep."
strandpaviljoen de toko callantsoog,positive,The restaurant contains one accessible toilet with handlebars.
stratford artshouse stratford upon avon,negative,On street public parking with some for blu badge users opposite.  Local buses too.
stratford artshouse stratford upon avon,positive,Accessible toilet in the ArtsHouse.
stratford international station london,positive,"A great rail service and helpful friendly assistance staff. A really handy station for changing to the DLR and for visiting the Westfield Centre. A large, modern accessible loo is situated in the ticket hall. It had a wide door, plenty of space and was clean and tidy."
stratford railway and underground station london,negative,"The facility is a railway station and is accessible either by bus, Jubilee Line and Docklands light railway, there is soem parking but i do not know where it is It is at Westerfield"
stratford railway and underground station london,positive,"Quite a hub of transport as it's an overground station and underground. It's near to the DLR station, International Station and the many bus stops. There's plenty of car parking at the adjacent Westfield Centre."
stratford town walk stratford upon avon,positive,"There is no parking as it is a 'walk round town' starting at the Bancroft Gardens, so use public parking.  All council car parks are free to blue badge users with no time limit, if using a blue badge bay or any other space.  On-street parking is also free with a mix of blue badge bays which have time limits, so check!  Private car parks have a mix of charges.  And don't forget Shopmobility at Bridgeway car park, 01789 414534, use a scooter of wheelchair for the day - donations are welcome or hire them for a longer period. Accessible public toilets round town require a Radar key and as usual some shops offer them too. "
stratford upon avon stratford upon avon,positive,"Parking is easy at all these places, not all disabled marked, but lots of room to park anyway.  Toilets are reasonable available, but not all have disabled toilets, so plan carefully. We found all to be clean enough, but pubs are busy places, so may not always be up to standard management would like."
strathaven hotel strathaven,negative,Accessible loo was close to the restaurant and easy to find. Access wasn't very wide and it wasn't very big inside. Just enough space for the wheelchair and a carer. Manageable but tricky. Grab rail on one side. No room for Changing Places toilet. All very clean and tidy.
strathaven hotel strathaven,positive,"We travelled by car. Several disabled parking spaces were right in front of hotel. Plenty other parking if disabled spaces were full.  We drove to the venue and parked in one of the many parking spaces beside the hotel. There is a disabled toilet on the ground floor.  There is no emergency red cord. See photo. big car park, level access from car park except for very small well-placed ramp at front door"
strathclyde country park caravan and motorhome club site bellshill,negative,"We took or car, where able to park 1 car next to the tent, additional car had to be parked outside the park. Disabled toilet was good but no changing facilities."
strathclyde country park motherwell,negative,"There was an accessible public loo on the opposite side of the road from the car park but this really wasn't great. A much better idea is to head up to the Watersports Centre where they have a very spacious accessible loo. (See separate review) Car park was rather uneven, frost and mud made it hard to see disabled bays but it was quiet so we parked easily. "
strathclyde country park motherwell,positive,There's a multitude of parking areas around the lake - or loch! We drove and found parking spaces easily. Getting there by public transport is a little tricker - Motherwell is the nearest train station and I didn't see any bus stops when we were in the Park. Outstanding-enormous and with a big changing platform if required. A hoist too. And even a mirror at the correct level for a wheelchair user!!!
strathclyde water sports centre motherwell,positive,We drove and there was Blue Badge parking right outside the main door. If you're using Public Transport it's a little bit trickier. Fantastic accessible loo - it's massive and was spotlessly clean.
strathspey railway aviemore,positive,"Disabled loo at station very clean and  roomy. Obviously no disabled loo on the train but return journey was about 1 hour  45 minutes including getting the steam engine turned around and filling up with water at one station. Very interesting . The car park was next to the station, all depends where your parked you could have a bit of a walk, but there is a wheelchair at the station you could have use of There is ample parking & 2 disabled spaces. just follow the signs for the steam railway from the roundabout as you come to Aviemore from the south. NB this is not the same as the car park for the mainline ScotRail, which is on the main street. From the car park, go over the level crossing & head up the platform to the ticket office. There is an accessible toilet halfway down the platform - go before you get on as I don't think there is one on the train. "
strawberry field liverpool,positive,There was a good size accessible toilet with grab rails it was very clean and the lighting is good and will come on as you enter the toilet.  The Toilet is on the ground floor level area past the café and is on the left hand side as you go towards the toilet  The only issue was that the red cord was short and by about 2 feet from the floor a Red cord card is in place 
strawberry fields cottages york,positive,"Parking area right next to the cottage entry  All bathroom facilities are accessible. Grab rails at the loos.  Great parking.  I have never used the public transport, but highly recommend the local park and ride into York.  One thing that might be an issue if your a wheelchair user on your own is the farm gate, but I am sure that Rod would help if you struggled opening and closing it.  They have always been great with me if I ever needed help. The toilet totally meets my needs.  There are commodes available that are modern and very clean.   We drove, parking for our accessible vehicle was very spacious.  You would need to have transport. Yes the facilities are fully accessible.  Each bungalow is slightly different, so it might we worth talking to the owners. "
streatham hill veterinary surgery london,positive,Streatham Hill Station is step-free and very near by. I don't know about parking in this area. Zillions of buses go up and down Streatham High Rd nearby. 
streetlife museum of transport hull,positive,Immaculate! Great toilet facilities
strid wood and the strid skipton,negative,I didn't use the loo but there were loos at Cavendish pavilion (? Not sure how accessible).
strid wood and the strid skipton,positive,"Riverside car park is huge. There are some accessible spaces but they weren't as obvious as they could be. There are no markings on the floor, just little signs on the fences. The accessible spaces are at the end nearest the Cavendish Pavillion. The accessible toilet at Cavendish Pavillion is RADAR locked. It was clean and well stocked and the hand dryer had sufficient vigour to actually dry wet hands, which seems rare. There was a very strange noise in the toilet. It sounded like a ghost train or something at a fairground. Most odd!   My only complaint was that later in the day, the ladies toilets were closed for cleaning and everyone was told to use the accessible toilet. This led to quite a queue and by the time I got in, the cleanliness had gone steeply downhill! The car park is huge.  The attendant told us there were blue badge spaces but we didn't find them as it was so busy! However there was plenty of room. The estate charges per car with no concessions - £8 but this enables you to access any of their car parks the same day (so you can relocate and do the abbey the same day for example)."
strid wood tea rooms skipton,positive,Disabled bays near the cafe. Day Parking had to be pre booking on the estate web site
strode theatre street,positive,"There is disabled parking onsite plus an overspill car-park close by.   Very clean, spacious and accessible with grab rails."
stroud general hospital stroud,negative,"Door opens inwards and either side of the loo are sanitary bins, so you cannot reverse alongside to transfer easily. Hand washbasin  not in reach when on loo. Red cord  cut off   at approx waist height when sat down, so anyone on the floor could not reach to summon help."
sts lord nelson southampton,positive,"The disabled access depends on where the ship is berthed, but the JST always try to ensure that if there is no accessible parking then accessible transport is near and/or the ship is easy to get to with step free access. It's worth noting that getting to the ship may involve a fast boat ride if she's anchored!  Make no mistake, you'll be helping to clean them at some point, but they're good! "
studio xiii shop and gallery edinburgh,negative,On street parking in the street outside. Only a few minutes walk from the Market Street entrance to Waverley Station.
submarine glasgow,positive,"Disabled parking outside of venue in town centre car park, it has level access straight to the venue only a short walk or roll away. The accessible toilet is on the same level as the main club and is accessed via a key that staff let you use to gain access  but have been informed by staff they shall be installing a radar key lock in the near future, toilet has pull down grab rails and other grab rail points as well as a low height sink."
subway airdrie,negative,This is some distance away in Hallgraig St and is a good 5 minutes plus if you are walking or in a chair
subway dunblane,positive,"Three disabled bays at the side of the restaurant.  I took half a star off as the in and out junctions are very short.  There's not slip ramp so getting back onto the dual carriageway is a little scary. Pretty nice loo, really liked the stripy tiles.  They made a nice change from wet wall and contrasted well with the handrails making it easier for a partially sighted person to distinguish.  Toilet is of comfort height :) There are two accessible parking bays which are the closest spaces to the store. The spaces have hatch markings, making it easy to get in and out of the car.  Although the toilet was a little tight, it did have everything I needed to use it safely. "
subway lytham saint annes,negative,There is a car park to the left as you enter the door that has Blue Badge spaces available and there was in fact a large number of general car park spaces available as well. There bus stops just a few mins away from this venue and bus travel to places like Fleetwood and Blackpool as well as other areas in the local area.  There is one toilet in the venue for everyone  it is located opposite the door you come in there is not a lot of space to let people pass you as they come out of the toilet or you go in. There are 2 doors both open outwards the first from the main venue area opens on to a small square area of about 3 or 4 feet to get to the second door once through this door you will find a good basic toilet however there is not a lot of space if someone needs assistance in anyway.
subway poole,negative,Toilets are a free for all and not monitored. During our visit local workmen were in and out  as we other members of the public. Unacceptable.
subway poole,positive,"Poole has plenty of disabled parkiglng around Poole, and a Mobility facility too."
subway york,negative,"There is no parking for subway, however, it is located nicely in a quiet area of the city centre, around the corner from the main town bus stop. A pay and display car park is located around the corner from subway.  The toilet in subway is a large disabled friendly toilet, however, the location of the toilet is in a very badly designed area as the door opens outwards into the area individuals stand to queue and order food. To use the toilet, staff need to be asked to unlocked the door. "
suck uk london,positive,"Good bus links, nearby train station and some on street parking."
sugar boat helensburgh,positive,"There public local disabled parking close to the restaurant which you reach by turning left via a lane from Sinclair Street (travelling North) between West Princes St and West King Street.   The accessible parking spaces opposite the carpark entrance are closest to Restaurant (approx. 10-15 Yards).   There is flat access from carpark to the Sugar Boat.    The accessible toilet is located at the back of the restaurant area.    This facility has easy access from the restaurant with the door opening outwards .   It is a very well equipped facility with plenty of room to turn a wheelchair. It has fixed grab rails at either side of the wash basin and fixed  rail on Right hand side and a  pull down rail on left of the WC as it faces you ahead.   There is ample room on left for transfers from wheelchair.    The wash room  also provides baby change mat on the left wall.    The chrome fitments, attractive tiles and the provision of hand soap and lotion and sleek fitments enhance the experience.    There were only 2 things that I would suggest could improve   - Firstly the pull emergency chord was wrapped around the grab rail.   I suspect this is to prevent accidental use.   Perhaps a small eyelet hook to route the chord further from the grab rail.   Allowing it to drop to the ground.   The personal waste box was discreet and would accommodate most refuse but perhaps larger nappies would necessitate a somewhat bigger repository.   However,  I think that this addition would require careful thought to prevent encroaching on to necessary wheelchair space.          "
sumburgh head lighthouse shetland,negative,There is a car park with one disabled car parking space but the car park is down the hill from the lighthouse so its not easy for wheelchair users.
sumburgh head lighthouse shetland,positive,"Plenty parking available and if you need to you can park in one of the 4 spaces up the top (3 for disabled access). The parking as great. There is a general car park at the bottom of the hill, a drop off point half way up the hill, and then two disabled bays at the top of the hill at the lighthouse and visitors centre."
summerfield farm whitby,negative,The loo is ok but only 1 drop down arm at present
summerfield farm whitby,positive,"Plenty of space to park.  Came in own car - would be difficult by public transport, though not too long taxi ride from Whitby station. Very clean and spacious.  hand rails, shower chair on wheels.  Wet room so plenty of room for carer to be in there for showering. Parking ride outside the door. We took our own shower/toilet chair but one can be provided. Ours was not able to sit far enough over the pan. This is a common problem with 'modern' close-coupled toilet cisterns. Better to have the old fashioned piped join and pull the pan forward. You can park right outside each of your designated cottage. The shared car park has plenty of space.  The downstairs loo is located in the wet room, which is big enough also to have a bath and wash basin. The shower works well and our daughter uses a sani chair when talking a shower. This sani chair also goes over the loo. Grab rails are provided. Parking just outside the cottage Loo had raised seat my husband has difficulty usually with loos but he found this easy to use Excellent parking provision right next to accommodation. We are not disabled, but found the parking more than satisfactory. Parking is directly outside the cottage and there is ample space for wheelchair accessible vehicles  The accessible loo is perfect for disabled use but my son is incontinent and wears pads and isn't able to use it.  The parking is a lovely hard asphalt area within only a few yards of the properties. Parking is great, plenty of room to park either right by the door, or in the shared car park, with easy access All fine Unfortunately I can't comment on local transport as we parked but we parked perfectly fine in the car park provided, around 10 metres from the cottage. Plenty of room for dad in the loo, hand rails etc Parking was very good. A short walk from the front doors of all the properties. It was spacious, allowing for wheelchairs or walkers to manoeuvre between vehicles Totally accessible ground floor toilet, next door to bedroom, not far from living room. Rails around toilet, I think the toilet was a normal height, we used a shower commode chair over the toilet as it was a better height, but I believe a toilet raiser is available. Plenty of room for two carers to assist The parking is amazing plenty of room  Good parking facilities with short distance to cottages Lots of space in toilet/ shower room enough space for more than 2 carers Everything you need for a disabled person On site parking available.  See my review  Space for vehicles right outside the cottages with level access Grab rails, very clean Large courtyard with parking for several cars. We also used a local taxi firm which was able to transport wheelchair user. Brand new accessible wet room on ground floor, with handles and grab rails. Wheel-in chair for shower, raised loo-seat and rails. parking was adequate and not to far away from cottage Parking was available within yards of accommodation.  Clean and tidy. Very spacious and plenty of room for carer. Plenty of parking available; would need own transport."
summerhall edinburgh,negative,Loo was fine - but there were loads of people waiting and many using the disabled loo. The accessible loo on the ground floor is right next to the standard loos - which mean there is generally a queue and people using it. It is also next to several stairs - which means that depending on which way you approach it you might have to nip back out in to the courtyard and back in through another door to get to it - once you know this though it's easy. Access loo in the bar/restaurant is quite a small space.
summerhall edinburgh,positive,"Good one on the ground floor. The disabled toilet is on the ground floor, and is spacious and clean. There is no pull-cord or red button to summon assistance. The area includes a pull down baby-change table. Bus stops nearby and it's near the meadows area of town which is pretty accessible. We were lucky as we found a spot right outside the level access gate. There is some on street parking nearby but it is often busy. It is right on the corner of the Meadows so there are plenty of bus routes nearby. Loo is large. No red cord. Served by a variety of bus routes both along the main road and in nearby streets it fairly easy to get to Summerhall from the centre of the city. Lothian Buses operate a fleet of assorted buses which have wheelchair access. There are a couple of accessible toilets. Once is small and compact and the other is a beautifully spacious room with enough space for a party! The larger accessible loo wins every time as there's so much turning space and plenty of room if you need a carer or PA to help.  Good sized accessible loo on the cafe side on the ground floor. Not sure about elsewhere."
summerhill garden centre billericay,positive,A large smooth car park. You do need to have a car to get here as it is on the A127 and buses do not go here. This has to be the biggest disabled toilet I have ever seen. There is however no emergency pull cord.
summerlee museum of scottish industrial life coatbridge,negative,There are a number of Blue badges spaces available in the car park next to the main gate and in the car park opposite the park. Coatbridge Central Station is at the bottom of the road.  While you can see the Museum from Coatbridge Sunnyside Station it is a long walk round via the town centre  The nearest bus service are from Coatbridge Fountain area this is around 10mins walk away from here you can get local buses plus services across Lanarkshire and into Glasgow.
summerlee museum of scottish industrial life coatbridge,positive,"Has to be as there is a wonderful Changing Place Toilet available this is located in the main exhibition hall area and is on your left hand side as you enter the hall. There is on site parking with quite a number of blue card holder parking spaces both at the gates to the entrance and in the carpark across from the park and there is also a drop off point. There are also Coatbridge Central and Coatbridge Sunnyside train stations close by, with Coatbridge Central only at the end of the road. Buses also run locally and from Glasgow to the Fountain which is about 10 minutes from the park itself. Overall the easiest way to access the Summerly Museum is by car with plenty of parking available.  The disabled toilet on site is exceptional. It is situated to the left as you enter the main exhibition hall and is well signposted. The toilet is fully equipped with an overhead track hoist and changing bench along a wash hand basin that is also on a track allowing it be moved up and down as well as along. There is plenty of disabled parking although it gets very busy at weekends. The car park is about 100 meters from the main entrance. Superb facilities"
sun beck cafe and farm shop york,positive,Down a farm track and parking to the left with loose chickens out. The paving is gravel so might need to be careful. accessible two loos for male and female.  Easy to find. Seemed enough space for a small wheelchair to menouver in the ladies . No red cord. clean.
sun cafe london,negative,"One disabled parking space at the Employment Academy, the building the cafe is in. Otherwise there is some on street parking further up Havil Street."
sun cafe london,positive,"Large disabled toilet, and the other toilet is also pretty big."
sunderland museum and winter gardens sunderland,positive,"There are two disabled toilets on each floor of the museum, which are clearly marked. The toilets are spacious and offer support aids and changing facilities, as well as emergency pull cords."
sunfloweri cardiff,negative,Busy on-street parking near venue but spaces on yellow lines if you have BB. Car Parks in Bay area approx 500-800m.
sunfloweri cardiff,positive,Accessible loo available but not visited on this occasion. Loads of on street parking and double yellows 2 yds from front door. Lots of space for chair and carer. ( sorry can’t remember about rails!) 
sunny house derby,negative,Limited parking but there are several buses.
sunnys restaurant dundee,positive," Parking facilities right outside the restaurant or nearby.  If you have a car driver and disabled it would be useful to be in possession of a blue badge.  The accessible toilet can be reached through  a door  which opens  in  The way, and then  slightly  turning your wheelchair to the left to access the sliding door  Into the toilet.  The toilet has grab rails."
sunset harbour club by diamond resorts costa adeje,positive,"Plenty of flights to Tenerife South Airport most days from most UK airports and the complex is a 30 minute taxi/minibus ride away,i hire a company that provides transfers for wheelchair users called Orange Bus in Tenerife. Excellent disabled toilet and shower room on the complex.Very big and plenty of room for a wheelchair and carer."
superdrug bristol,negative,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately away near Waitrose on Link Rd approximately 150m away. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
superdrug edinburgh,negative,No parking but you can get buses (which are wheelchair accessible) nearby. Accessible parking in centre carpark although some distance away
superdry london,negative,"I was really dismayed by the accessible toilet. See my photos.  The approach to the toilet is a combination of an extremely dark corridor combined with glaring lights which dazzle your eyes - a really nasty, uncomfortable experience.  In the toilet cubicle the lighting is very dim.  The red emergency cord was tied up high and out of reach. It was not possible to activate it from below the level of the grab-rail. This is VERY dangerous and negligent. If someone falls over in the precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back, and is injured and needs to summon urgent assistance, they will not be able to do so from the floor, and this could have very dangerous and serious consequences. The red emergency cord should reach all the way to the floor at all times and should NEVER be tied up or tidied away.  One other small point: the accessible toilet is labelled 'Disabled toilet'. This toilet is not disabled. It is for disabled people. It should be labelled 'Accessible toilet'. This is a small point, but important because the right wording shows respect for customers.  The basic layout and design of the toilet, if everything were present and correct, is good. All the problems above are caused by the stupidity and negligence of management and staff.  "
superdry london,positive,"The nearest step-free tube station is Green Park: from there, go east along Piccadilly and turn left up Swallow Street. Zillions of bus routes serve Piccadilly and Regent Street.  Bond Street tube station is now fully step free, as is Tottenham Court Road (except you need manual boarding ramps to be deployed by staff if you want to use the Central Line at these two stations)."
surgeons hall museums edinburgh,negative,"Easy access by bus. Lots of buses stop nearby. Not sure about parking though. I didn't see any dedicated parking for the museum, so parking would be on street."
surgeons hall museums edinburgh,positive,"There are several buses that stop close by.  There is an accessible toilet in the basement, but I didn't use it when i visited. There are good bus links and there is some nearby on street parking. The toilets are spacious and clean."
sushimania nottingham,negative,"No parking nearby, we use blue badge bays over by the cathedral and walk over, which takes us 5mins? 15min on a bad day. It isn't far off the square so there is a lot of bus access. It is also on a slope so may be difficult if you have mobility problems"
sushimania nottingham,positive,Nothing out of the ordinary. I did like that my partner went to use their accessible loo (he has EDS and was walking unaided that day) and as he shut the door staff knocked on it and told him he was in a disabled loo and where the regular ones are. As soon as he said he did actually need that loo they backed off immediately. It's a bit annoying when your disability is hidden but it's good to know they are trying to keep the wrong people out :)
sutton bank national park centre thirsk,positive,"Ample number of disabled parking spaces, mostly unused on the Bank Holiday Monday when we visited.  In the courtyard adjacent to other toilets. Assessed by radar key, obtainable from the Centre. Roomy enough to easily accommodate  a carer and or a wheelchair or scooter, and well equipped with grab rails etc. Ample parking near visitor centre and designated bays for Blue Badge holders. Radar-operated accessible loo in the courtyard of the visitor centre. not the cleanest but OK. "
sv tenacious southampton,positive,As a mode of transport it was great you’ve got to be able to walk up the gang plank. Yes yes yes and yes
swallow cottage burradon,positive,"There are bus routes not too far away but it's a fair walk down the farm drive to the cottage. So driving a necessity really. There's a designated disabled space reserved outside the cottage. Wet room has a loo, shower, grab rails and two basins (one lowered). Tilled floor. Only problem was the room got very hot - essential to open window. Well equipped. However, alarm cord inaccessible as tied up. Wonderfully large wet room and toilet "
swallows nest cockfield,positive,"Parking is right outside the main door and, if needed, there is also ready access from cars through the door into the sitting room. Well catered for with ready access to the one from the master bedroom."
swan restaurant at the globe london,negative,A wheelchair accessible toilet is available and will accommodate most people. Not as big as it could be.
swan restaurant at the globe london,positive,Accessible toilet available. It's fine.
swansea grand theatre swansea,positive,"Blue Badge car park directly opposite the theatre. A good amount of spaces to with a reduced rate for Blue Badge holders. Flat access across the road to the theatre. Easy to find, accessed via key held by the usher. Small but has grab rails and room to transfer ."
swansea museum swansea,negative,Single yellow line with disabled badge 200ft away from the main entrance There was a rear automatic door near the toilets but I couldn' t see the way in through the fenceline for this.
swanston brasserie edinburgh,negative,"The only reason I didn't give this venue full marks was the parking.  It is somewhat off the beaten track and the car park is on a hill.  Also there is a bit of a hike to get in. You have to go downstairs but it is large, clean and well-appointed."
swanston brasserie edinburgh,positive,Parking right outside the door - although can get busy - there was only one pace left when we were there. Bit of a trek to get to using public transport though. Accessible loo was clean and tidy - although the mirror was missing when we visited.
swatters carr middlesbrough,positive,All toilets are very clean
sweet mandarin manchester,positive,There is accessible blue badge bays directly outside the entrance. 
sweetpea cafe dundee,negative,"There isn’t an accessible toilet. I thought there was and went to the toilet but a member of staff came over quickly to tell me their toilet is tiny and not accessible, she was very apologetic and said the restaurants across the road both have accessible toilets."
sweetpea cafe dundee,positive,I travelled by car but it’s only a few minutes away from bus stops and the train station. We parked in the street nearby  (using blue badge)
swg3 studio warehouse glasgow,negative," It could be difficult to get here by train or subway depending upon your disability as stations are about 10-14 minutes walk away.  I came by car and was directed into a locked car-park manned by security adjacent to the venue.  There was plenty of space and staff were very helpful, holding gates etc.  As the complex is in an old industrial area, the ground around it is a bit uneven and bumpy, especially for me in my chair but they have ramped access to the hall through automatic doors and plenty of lovely staff to hold doors etc."
swg3 studio warehouse glasgow,positive,Good size and staff to help you get there through crowd Got parked in secure car park right next to venue. Security helped us in and out. 
swindon designer outlet swindon,positive,"A large car park with Blue Badge parking not too far from the main entrance. Free parking for disabled visitors. There are a number of good disabled loos, including one near the entrance."
swindon train station new bridge square,positive,Lots of buses pass the front of the station. There is a taxi rank close to the station too. Reasonable level access from the station to the town centre.
szara kazimierz krakow,positive,"The road parallel to the restaurant is a main road which has trams running along. I didn't use the tram while I was there so unable to comment, apart from I noticed that the new trams had wheelchair signs by one of the doors."
t k maxx edinburgh,positive,"Blue Badge parking immediately outside the front door. Accessible buses, from Lothian Buses, come into the Craigleith Retail Park."
tacofino victoria,negative,"A person with a cane could possibly use the loo, but it’d be sketchy. Not enough room for a person using a scooter or a wheelchair to negotiate , and certainly no space for a carer. "
tacofino victoria,positive,"Located right downtown on busy Fort Street and on a main bus route, popular-with-the-locals Tacofino is easy to access, but hard to find a place to sit and eat your delicious lunch."
tailend st andrews,negative,There is a disabled toilet but again there are  access problems for wheelchair users.  The problem is that you must go up several stairs in order to get to the disabled loo.   The disabled toilet is spacious and does have an emergency red cord. See photo.
tailend st andrews,positive,We drove to the restaurant. The town was busy but luckily we managed to find offstreet parking very close to the restaurant.
talbot rice gallery edinburgh,positive,"Nearby North Bridge / Nicholson Street / Chambers Street and also Lauriston, therefore loads of bus options. Might want to get off at Nicholson Street."
talkin tarn country park brampton,positive,"Large tarmac carpark. Free parking for Blue Badge holders for 3 hours, if you display the time you arrived. Follow driveway at far side of carpark for more marked bays behind café. Route from here is less steep. If you parked in main carpark then came this way, you would encounter rather steep speed humps - risk of grounding!"
tallinn tallinn,positive,We arrived by cruise ship and it was just a fifteen minute walk into the centre. Make sure to get a map at the port and ask the Guide for the best way in for your wheels.  Very well signed in the Centre and Well appointed inside. 
tankersley manor tankersley,negative,"I drove and, sorry, have no idea about public transport. Parking is tricky as only one dis bay exists on the same level as reception. No emergency cord, room was tricky to manoeuvre in because the baby changing table was not fixed on the day I visited and took up half the room."
tannadice park dundee,negative,"Easy street car parking, 1/2 mile walk to the stadium. "
tantrum doughnuts glasgow,positive,I don't really know Glasgow transport very well but it's very near Kelvingrove Gallery so if you're in car there is plenty of on street parking.
tarbet pier arrochar,positive,"There is a fairly large car park, although there are relatively few blue badge spaces. However it is all level, with tarmac, and it would be possible to drop someone off near the toilets/cafe. The toilet is inside the building. It is very spacious and has grab rails on both sides.    We were pleasantly surprised that it was open, even on Christmas Eve."
tarbolton library tarbolton,positive,We parked in one of the parking bays outside
tarn hows coniston,negative,"Car park reasonable size but very busy during the summer.  Limited disabled places.   Note the roads to Tarn Hows are twisty and narrow, not great if someone is not a good travelling.  But it's so worth it when you arrive. More info on the website  There is another disabled only car park above the tarns with nice views. Basic loo, but plenty room enough.  Didn't smell too good."
taste cafe chesil beach portland,positive,Disabled parking is in a public car park but just outside the cafe. Payment of £1 for the hour but blue badge holders get an extra hour on top. There are 9 spaces dedicated to blue badge holders with marked out extra wide spaces.
taste of italy edinburgh,negative,"Its close to Elm Row bus stop (3 minute walk), OMNI (2 Minute walk) York Place (3 minute walk). It is on the corner of a busy round about so that could be a problem for some people. Its close to the last tram stop on York Place. And theres a taxi rank at OMNI."
taste of italy edinburgh,positive,"There is an accessible toilet, forgot to take pic but will update next visit. "
taste perthshire perth,negative,There is a big car park. 
taste perthshire perth,positive,There is a accessible loo right near the men and woman’s toilets right outside the restaurant.
tate britain london,negative,"Walked from Vauxhall Station, about a 15 minute direct walk over the bridge. I didn't use the accessible loo, however the 'accessible' cubicle within the gents toilets had a lock which you really needed two hands to use - so I used another cubicle. Not sure as we went on foot from our hotel nearby."
tate britain london,positive,"Travelled from out of London by car, so disabled parking was essential. Five blue badge spaces in the staff carpark, should be booked at least 24hr ahead. Set SatNav to John Islip Street rather than to the main entrance. Staff car park is not obvious, so keep a good eye out.  No clear recollection of the toilets, husband often leaves scooter outside and uses the Gents, so maybe we didn't see the accessible loo. Whatever we used, no problems. We walked there so not sure. Good. To nitpick i would like a bit more room but my wheelchair is very big. 2 large and clean accessible loos - one with main grab rails on the left and one with main grab rails on the right."
tate liverpool liverpool,negative,Has a changing place however is rather small with only excess to the bed from one side. 
tate liverpool liverpool,positive,Large car park nearby and on the bus route 
tate modern london,positive,"There are 12 spacious pre bookable blue badge parking bays. These can be booked via the telephone and the website clearly explains how to get to the vehicle entrance. There spaces are located adjacent to one of the level access entry doors Plenty of disabled toilets through the building. All spacious with light weight doors and wave activated flush systems, Plentiful bus and rail links nearby, Blackfriars station being my access point. Basically, five star! Clean, red cords as they should be and a Changing Places. One thing I really liked was the accessible toilets weren't shared as baby changing, so no queues of riotous kids. Only thing I did find was one or two doors open outwards in to pretty crowded corridors, but a minor detail really! Parking can be arranged and public transport in the area is very good. The Millennium Bridge is useful for people coming across from the North bank of the river Thames. Toilets were really good with plenty of space, clean and well equipped. There's a Changing Places toilet on level zero. Some on street parking and good bus links. If you use a power chair like me, there are also two accessible tube stations nearby – Victoria and Westminster. There are accessible toilets throughout the gallery."
tate st ives saint ives,positive,"We parked in the Tate carpark behind it adjacent to the public carpark. I imagine in the height of summer, everything would be full. The toilet has the usual facilities plus a bed and a hoist and is very large."
taverham nursery centre norwich,positive,"I drove . It is a large carpark actually split into 2. Mostly tarmac. The front part services the garden centre, large restaurant and pet store. The second half , around the back of the garden centre caters for the small shops and the 2nd restaurant which has outdoor seating. The main toilet in the garden centre is large, clean and well maintained. It is not a Changing Places toilet. The second toilet near the outside restaurant is accessed by a key code and is much smaller and I am unsure whether you could actually get a wheelchair in it."
tavistock relationships london,positive,The accessible toilet is large and spacious and has the regular grab rails. It is also a higher seat than on regular toilets.
taxi la palma brena baja la palma,positive,The taxi picked me up and returned me to my hotel. There were none in the vehicle. We had a stop at Las Nieves Church and was advised that this was the last place we were visiting which had toilets. I used the toilets in café and they had a disabled accessible toilet with grab rails but no alarm.
taylor gardens park and play area 2b 4 taylor gardens,negative,"There is an accessible toilet adjacent to the park. The door has a RADAR lock, is spacious, not the greatest of places but is serviceable."
taylor gardens park and play area 2b 4 taylor gardens,positive,On street parking adjacent to the park.
taynish national nature reserve lochgilphead,positive,There is one disabled parking spot but a few other parking spots too but it doesn't usually get too busy. I have travelled all the way down to the car park in my power wheelchair with no issues but it does take about half an hour. 
tayto park ashbourne,negative,"The car park is huge and plenty of room 2 get in and out of the cars. I didnt, however, notice if they had specific areas 4 disabled parking. We managed fine without it."
tayto park ashbourne,positive,Lots of toilet cubicles throughout the park easily accessed and plenty of room
tea and cake cardiff,negative,On street parking outside.  Disabled Bay approx 100m at Penylan Library Council Car Park (free to blue badge holders). Accessible toilet available but not visited.
tea and chat nuneaton,positive,I don't drive but it is close to a car park with disabled parking spaces.
tea rooms at the pet cemetery holywell,positive,Parking is limited but more than enough for the cafe and cemetery. Just no designated disabled bays. Best to get there by car/van as not on a main bus route. 
teapot island yalding,negative,There is a toilet labelled with the wheelchair access sign in the car park / field. I did not look inside. Toilets are available at the cafe and all visitors need to ask for a key - I  did not see any signs to them being accessible. 
teapot island yalding,positive,"There is a large field with a toilet block and pay to enter barriers that is used for parking for visitors to Teapot Island, boaters, people having picnics etc. The field entrance is bumpy but the grass is not so bad - we parked very close to the ramp and bridge that leads to the museum. Parking is also available on the road/ever side  but was very busy. It costs £2-3 per day depending on when you visit."
teasy does it newcastle upon tyne,negative,"No dedicated loo.  However there's a single loo on the ground floor, accessible if you can walk.  There's a small step (half an inch?) down from the tea room to the lobby leading to the loo. This lobby and the loo have vinyl flooring which is quite slippery so care needed if using crutches or sticks. The door is a little stiff but not heavy - I managed it unaided. No grab rails but a ledge to one side and wash hand basin on the other provided enough support for me."
tebay services orton,negative,There are two accessible toilets these are located next to the ladies and gents on the right had side as you enter. The are good basic accessible toilets with rails available to hold on to. The doors open out the way this is fine however the toilet nearest the ladies toilet opens on to the area that people walk past. I watch someone exit the toilet almost hit a member of staff with the door as they were standing waiting to check it was clean. I took a star away because of this as someone could get hurt if the door was thrown open by someone leaving the toilet
tebay services orton,positive,Plenty of disabled parking spaces 2 disabled toilets - plenty of space and grab rails A good number of Blue badge spaces available these are the nearest to the main building however these could soon fill up at peak times such as public holiday Mondays when a large number of people are travelling about. See review. Faultless

tees railway path middleton in teesdale,negative,"We parked in Romaldkirk opposite the hotel. There's no parking near the start of the path (standing with hotel behind you, go right - cross the main road and head up the lane on the opposite side. The path start is about 3 minutes up the lane after the houses on the right). There's no car park in the village and no marked bays so park with care. No loo. However we left the path at Middleton and visited the Crown (see my other review) which has an exemplary assisted loo as well as great access and food. At Romaldkirk the hotel has a downstairs loo which is not adapted but you can wheel to the door and then walk into the cubicle if you are able - staff very helpful."

tenpin fountain park edinburgh,negative,Lothian buses stop a few minutes away. Parking is available underground. Door was very heavy and hard to find as no signage. The red cord was cut and staff said they didn’t know how to replace it - will follow this up. There are handrails on both sides and space under the sink to roll under. This bathroom is quite large with more than enough space for a power chair and carer. 
terrace leeds,negative,"You can call ahead to request a disabled parking space, but otherwise the nearest parking is on Woodhouse street, which is a 15 minute walk up the hill to get to the university. However there is a bus stop that stops outside the university (and then a few minutes walk to Terrace Bar), or you can take a taxi and ask them to drop you at Clarence Road (near the union).  Buses are regular from the city centre. "
terrace leeds,positive,"Accessible toilet available in the union, you need to come out of Terrace bar and it is near the entrance of the union (just outside Terrace). Large room, grab rails, clean and well maintained. "
terre et toi saint geraud de corps,negative,We were able to park the car a short distance from the cabin however there was a gravel path so some assistance may be needed. Compost toilet so not fully geared up for access. However sizeable room and roll in shower (with mains plumbing). Plenty of room for shower chair and carer.
tesco claremorris,positive,"Tesco’s has a large car park.  There is free parking 24 hours a week with several family parking spaces available and disabled parking spaces are located along the entrance.  There is a path leading from the entrance to the end of the car park and a pedestrian crossing with zebra stripes to aid anyone with a visual impairment.

tesco dunfermline fire station superstore dunfermline,negative,"There is an accessible loo, good size, red cord to standard, door easy to open. BUT side transfer is impossible as there are three bins in there. One is a huge cleaner's bin. I have complained on and off for two years now and just get shrugged shoulders. They just don't get it. Anyone have influence with this store?"

tesco edinburgh,positive,Blue Badge parking in adjacent car park. Bus stops close to both entrances.
tesco extra cleethorpes,negative,"Accessible toilet is outside next to the café within the supermarket. On the toilet door it has a nice sign that say's ""not every disability is visible"" Accessible emergency red cord. Tight squeeze but there's just enough room for a small manual wheelchair and a carer nut a powerchair might not fit, esp with a carer and a mobility scooter defiantly wouldn't fit in. Little room to manoeuvre around in, especially to transfer from chair to toilet. Grab rails. Clean and tidy and if not or say the soap is missing Tesco customer services are happy to rectify. The is an accessible toilet and it has a great sign on it that says ""not all disabilities are visible"". It's a bit of a squeeze but there's just enough room for my wheelchair and my carer to come into the toilet if needed. The accessible toilet has grab rails and an emergency red cord. It's usually is clean and tidy but if not, such as if the soap is missing the customer service desk is happy to rectify that. The signs for the toilets are easy to find."
tesco extra cleethorpes,positive,"Parking is in the Tesco car park. Blue badge parking spaces. Some misuse of these spaces but you can park in the parent and child spaces with a blue badge if need be. These spaces are close to the store. Car park is a bit uneven so it can be a bit of a workout if you're in a manual wheelchair. The entrance to the supermarket has a bit of a ramp which can be difficult if you hit it at the wrong angle. Plenty of parking spaces for blue badge holders which are near to the store and on an even-ish level. If need be you can park in the parent and child spaces if you have a blue badge. There is some misuse of blue badge parking spaces which can't be enforced but we've always managed to find somewhere near to the store to park either in the blue badge spaces or parent and child spaces. The car park is on a bit of an uneven level so if can be tricky to push yourself in a manual wheelchair, esp if you don't have great upper body strength. There is a slight slope into the store's entrance that I personally need a hand with if I hit it an an awkward angle but my carers or a helpful passer by is always at hand."
tesco extra crown centre,positive,Lots of parking spaces good local transport There is a toilet just outside the store but still in the covered shopping centre.you need a radar key to get in but if you do t have yours they lend you one at customer services Disabled parking in underground carpark Excellent Full Changing Places toilet out store doors with all of the other public toilets

tesco extra glasgow,positive,"yes, there are lots of disabled spots right at the front door and its covered so good for bad weather. very accessible, well signed, very big and tidy, hand rails and emergency pull. There are just about as many accessible parking bays here as there are general bays (still difficult to get parked on busy days though so pick your shopping times wisely)."
tesco extra nottingham,positive,"Toilet door was unlocked and narrow. There were 3 bins in the loo and the emergency cord had been cut short. There were grab rails (white) around the toilet, sink and on door. There wasn't a lowered coat hook. The loo was too small for more than one person and wasn't very clean.  Notice: There is a changing places toilet but I've not seen it. "
tesco extra rainham,negative,the cord is always tied up
tesco extra rainham,positive,there plenty of disabled spaces & there bus stops nearby

tesco falkirk superstore falkirk,positive,"Tesco's has plenty of accessible parking spaces immediately outside the front door. It is also a five minute walk from the local railway station and bus stops. There is a smooth, level walkway from the parking spaces to the main entrance."
tesco metro cheltenham,positive,It's a 5 to 10 minute walk as it is in the centre of town so it's quite easy wheelchair uses to get there.
tesco metro edinburgh,positive,"As a bus user there is more than adequate services within the current service restrictions, the services are 11, 16, and 101, these service are all chassis drop, with ramp and double door one at the front, the exit in the middle.You are permitted to exit the front door to exit using the chassis drop.

tesco metro glasgow,positive,"Toilets are located in the St. Enoch Shopping center. The all clean with plenty of space for career. The toilets also lock and unlock without much effort. Clean and well stocked with toilet roll. There is access to a disabled toilet in the shop. It was clean and enough room for manoeuvring, enough space for a carer in the toilet. "
tesco superstore derby,negative,There was accessible parking but it was quite a trek from door. I didn't see any bays close by.
tesco superstore forres,positive,"When I drive there, I park in the car park right outside the tesco with more than enough spaces, if I take the bus, there is a bus stop right outside Plenty of room inside, right at the door, only reason it had a 4 out of 5 is because at the entrance there was no sign telling you where the toilet was, you would just have to look around but it was right at the door with a toilet sign above"
tesco superstore glasgow,negative,"There was a toilet, although it was not sign posted very well. It was rather on the small size so I am sure manoeuvring within it would be very difficult for both the user and carer. The toilet was not clean and lacked basic sanitary products, such as a working Hand dryer and clean soap. The locks on the door were broken. However, there were grab rails and an emergency lever."
tesco superstore glasgow,positive,"Tesco Craigmarloch had very good disabled parking. It was in a close range to the entrance to the store but enough distance apart from other parking bays, allowing for any procedures to be carried out with ease. In terms of bus services these were every thirty minutes. I would not recommend using these buses as they lacked in disabled accessibility. "
tesco superstore prestatyn,positive,"Close level access to parking and the rail station  Red cord was in the right place, total winner! Toilet was clean and not a storeroom and all facilities worked. Space for transfer and to turn the chair."
teuchters landing edinburgh,negative,"Taxi can get pretty close to the entrance. The road is cobbled, which can be a pain in the bum (literally when you're bumping along it!). Buses to Commercial Street. I think there might be Blue Badge parking at Commercial Quay, but again the access road to the pub is cobbled. Although there is an accessible loo (with grab rails), the door is really heavy and the loo is too small to turn around in if you're on wheels. This means that if you went in forward, you'll have to exit backwards, on an uneven floor, with limited visibility, while trying to hold the heavy door open. In addition I got stuck on something (a gap in floorboards maybe?) while the heavy door tried to close on me and the baby change thingy attached to the back of the door brained me.  Great hand dryer!"
teviot house edinburgh,negative,"Toilets very small, very awkward to fit wheelchair in. I did manage to park but there are no actual disabled bays, I was a good distance away and access from parking is over cobbles. No signage to find disabled toilets, only regular loos. Toilet very tight fit, no usable turn area. Couldn't get under basin due to bin.   Fixed vertical and horizontal L, drop down and fixed vertical R. Paper dispenser very high. Emergency cord white and cut off at standing height."
teviot row house edinburgh,negative,"Over a year on, Bristo Square is still a construction site. So direct access is not really possible. I don't know about any near car parking"
teviot row house edinburgh,positive,Very close to a lot of transport options so can't really complain about getting there
tgi fridays castleford,positive,"The centre where the restaurant is, was very well signposted with lots of car parking space. There are plenty of disabled parking spaces very close to the entrance of the venue, making it easily accessible. The accessible toilet was easy to find and had a large sign on the door. It was spacious, clean and tidy. There would be plenty of room for 2 people (a carer) to fit in. There were grab rails and an emergency alarm to pull if needed. There was a note on the door stating the lock was broken at present, which could be problematic for a disabled individual if they were alone."
tgi fridays edinburgh,positive,Plenty of parking and bus links Clean and spacious
tgi fridays glasgow,positive,"Large covered car park, lots of disabled spaces. Automatic doors through to shopping area.."
tgi fridays guildford,positive,"Guildford Station is fully step free and has sweetly helpful staff. Manual wheelchair users beware: to get between platforms, you have to use EXTREMELY steep concrete ramps, and some manual wheelchair users may find these challenging.   I don't know about buses or parking in Guildford. "
tgi fridays park gate,positive,Disabled parking bays near the main entrance.
thackray museum of medicine leeds,positive,Several well marked spaces and clear sign re charge ( none ) Part of a big hospital do busy road outside  One on each floor As excpected
thai sarocha restaurant salisbury,positive,There were two public carparks within a 5 minute wheel. These were fairly flat and an active chair user can manage these independently. Parking in the Cranesbridge Road carpark was free for blue badge holders.
thai square islington london,positive,"Accessible via buses with ramps and wheelchair space. However, the nearest station (Angel), has two escalators and no lifts."
thalys international saint gilles,negative,"The loo is close to the wheelchair space and equipped with a grab rail and alarm button, but is very small. The door opens both outwards and inwards. There wasn't room for our manual wheelchair to remain in the loo with the user, so the accompanist got the user seated and then parked the wheelchair in the corridor. An unaccompanied wheelchair user might find it impossible to use the facility.  There isn't enough space for side transfer onto the loo to be possible."
thalys international saint gilles,positive,We used a wheelchair taxi organised by Accessible Travel Netherlands to get us from the ferry terminal at Ijmuiden to Amsterdam Centraal Station. Drop off is very convenient and that station has lift access to all platforms.
thames chase forest centre upminster,negative,"Access to the toilet could have been better. There was a heavy door , (no button access), and you had to push through that, (no magnet to hold it back). It then immediately sloped up the passage. This was difficult. The toilet was adequate though rather full of bins. The red cord was tied up out of the way and we did mention this to the reception team and attach a card."
thames chase forest centre upminster,positive,The entrance is down a small country lane so I think you would have a fair walk from the nearest bus stop.  Parking is provided in a separate area for the disabled which is brick laid and leads immediately to the brick path to the visitor centre.. The only problem we had is that the brick paving ended exactly where our ramp ended meaning it was hard to push from the gravel.
thatch close cottages llangrove,positive,"Access is by road only, and we didn’t have any problems finding the access road via SatNav and Google Maps. We parked directly outside the cottage with level access throughout. Superb toilet and shower facilities are provided in a full wet room accessed via a wide door from the bedroom. Drop down handrails are provided either side of the toilet with ample space for turning my wheelchair and transferring to the toilet, and also to the shower chair which was kindly provided. Car Good wetroom -  Just needed a raised toilet frame (for our needs) You would need a car. Parking was directly outside the cottage, as near as you wanted.  The loo is in the large wet room, with plenty of grab rails in a contrasting colour for those who might need that. There was plenty of room for a carer/ wheelchair and a shower chair is available although there is a fold down shower seat. The sink ( like the dressing table in the bedroom and the sink/worktop in the kitchen) is adjustable. The place was spotless with plenty of towels, loo paper and soap. The toilet even washed and dried you!!  Plenty of space to park with enough flat space for wheelchair access Transfer left or right, loo with integral wash/dry. Rails throughout the wet room.  Only accessible by private car or taxi as a rural location, narrow country lanes. Use Google maps not Sat Nav. Helpful instructions on their website. Parking outside property all level to front door. The property has a Clos-o-mat washer/dryer toilet and drop down grab rails either side for support. This is what we liked about the property as we have a toilet like this at home. It gives independence - home from home for us! The large wet room offers space to move your wheelchair around freely. Lots of space for a carer if needed. Lots of parking space available.  The courtyard is pebbled but if needed the car can be pulled up almost outside the door. Fully disabled toilet facilities. We were able to park outside the cottage. There were accessible loos on the ground floor in two cottages. All other loos had support bars. By car The toilet was equipped with rails and a good height, also very clean. Must have car/van to reach. Lanes are narrow if not used to driving in countryside Large space; level access shower The charm of this location is it being completely nestled into the Wye Valley countryside.  However, that means you need a car to get too and fro.  You can park your car very close to the door and no step to negotiate to enter the cottage. The full system including full length flush lever.  Generous space in the loo and the bathrooms. We drove and were able to park right outside the cottage.  We could take the wheelchair from the car park right inside the cottage. The door to the bathroom/wet room is spacious.  There is room for a carer.  There are safety rails and a seat for the shower.  It is level throughout. You need a car to get to Thatch Close but loads of parking and you can get right up to the cottage door to unload. Plenty of grips on both side and at loo/basin/shower etc. Washbasin rises/falls. Loo has wash/dry facility. Loo has eco double flush. In 2 storey Brambles Barn, the 2 ensuite bathrooms and the ground floor loo all have grips etc. Downstairs loo flushes by leaning back and has wash/dry facility. No public transport nearby.  Can park car immediately in front of cottages By car. Ground floor was fully accessible (shower, bidet, loo) It was a boon being able to park so close to the door and on a level surface with no hidden traps. We drove. My brother has a wheelchair accessible car. No parking problems. The wet room in Valley view is very large and my brothers carer was able to move around.  Very clean and tidy.  Downstairs toilet in Brambles Barn You can park very close to the door to unload and you have a designated parking place - loads of space for unloading, turning etc.  You need a car to get there and to go on visits, as you are deep in the country. If you wanted a very quiet holiday, you could happily sit in the outside areas and look at the wonderful views, watch the birds and sip a glass of wine as you admire the sunsets. Ground floor loo - ""wash and dry"" function, lean back to flush, grab rails. Emergency cord 2 Upstairs shower rooms/loos - grab rails, emergency cord. Very smart looking while being very functional. Brilliant. There's plenty of space and you can park right by the door of the barn. The bathrooms/toilets are all beautifully designed shower rooms with non slip floors, plenty of handrails and emergency cords. All the bathrooms were immaculate. They were also easily large enough to accommodate a carer. You would need to have transport to stay here. Parking very accessible outside of cottage. Lanes narrow as you would expect this far out in the countryside, but fine for our MPV. Didn't use the loo so cannot comment although the wet room worked well for us. We brought our own shower chair and hired a hoist from a local company recommended by the owners.  Parking is outside the cottage , the ground is level gravel to the door which has a ramp  The loo is directly off the bedroom, there are ample grab bars and space for a wheelchair. The bathroom is large with plenty of space for a carer and is well ventilated and a full wet room. The sink is electrically height adjustable and suitable for both able bodied and disable users The cottage is down a narrow lane. You can park right outside the cottage. There are flagstones immediately outside and fine gravel otherwise.  The spacious wetroom style bathroom has a shower seat, lots of grabrails and even a wash-dry loo. Also an emergency cord and height adjustable basin. See the photos on the cottage website. Parked immediately in front of house door to off load then parked to the side of the property - loads of space. Cottages are very rural, up country lanes - need a car. Loads of turning space. The bathroom in Valley View is very spacious and has lots of grip rails - both sides of loo. Loo can be flushed from either left or right side. Washes and dries your bottom if required! Variable height washbasin.  see pics on web site www.thatchclosecottages.co.uk Groundfloor loo in Bramble Barn has all that but can also be flushed merely by leaning back firmly. Upstairs loos have grip rails. Drive right up to the front door - oodles of transfer space and often a helping hand on offer!  Easy with transfer from either side Mini Bus (Own) Wonderful size wetroom, wash basin can be changed for use of wheelchair, via remote Flat parking immediately outside front door so getting a wheelchair out of the car and into the cottage is a doddle. Huge bathroom / wetroom with basin and ample surrounding storage space that can be raised / lowered electrically, Geberit lavatory with optional wash facility, shower area with fold-down shower seat and plenty of room for a wheeled shower chair if one is needed.  Plenty of sturdy grab rails in shower area and on both sides of the loo;  emergency alarm cord. By road Spotless and modern"
the 3 bridges queensferry,positive,There is a spacious car park adjacent to the venue.  No disabled bays are marked out.  There is a flat walk to the restaurant although the tarmac is a bit uneven in places. The toilets are accessible and spacious with sufficient space for a wheelchair. The red cord needs to be accessible in case of an emergency. Parking is fine - it's a bit of a bumpy surface but it's close to the restaurant.  Excellent large car park with wheelchair ramp going to restaurant. There is a car park to the right of the building but its on a hill. We didn't use this car park but used the large one across the road which has several accessible bays. There is level pavements and crossings over the road to the pavement outside the restaurant.  Once you manage to get in the building through the fire door the toilets were good! Located to the right inside the conservatory. The doors were easy to open and the area was very clean. Cannot fault them at all. 
the a45   daventry daventry,negative,"The disabled toilets reviewed are ok, easy enough to find, but all very basic toilets, they have tried to help disabled the best they can, and we feel you will cope until you get home."
the a45   daventry daventry,positive,"There are disabled parking bays in all the venues, with easy enough access to the places of interest, the only slight concern is the low small step up into the entrance for FAWSLEY HALL HOTEL, but we coped very easily with that."
the abbots fireside elham,negative,"No dedicated parking for the disabled & limited parking adjacent to the restaurant. There is street parking, although the area does get busy. "
the abbots inch renfrew,negative,Well located and spacious.
the abbots inch renfrew,positive,Plenty of disabled parking available.
the acorn centre inverurie,positive,There is accessible parking at the centre. It is in the centre of Inverurie and easily reached by bus and train. The accessible loo is well signposted. It is large enough for a carer. It is also the baby change. It is very clean.
the adamson saint andrews,negative,As above.
the adamson saint andrews,positive,"All the rails, basins and dryers you need, with nice soap."
the adamson st andrews,positive,"The restaurant is on a main road so i think there would be public transport nearby but don't know for sure as we used our car with which there is plenty of parking on the streets in St Andrews. Excellent accessible toilet with plenty of grab handles,only downside was i couldn't turn around in my powerchair so had to reverse out but my chair is quiet big."
the airedale heifer riddlesden,positive,"Large carpark with plenty of spaces and a  level forecourt for taxis and loading. The pub is located on Bradford Rd Sandbeds, nr Keighley with bus stops within 50m and Crossflats Railway Station 1.1miles"
the albany centre glasgow,positive,"On street parking for blue badge holders disabled parking space can be booked in Albany Car park Good size, meets min access requirements."
the albany london,positive,"Transportation access is good, both New Cross Station and Deptford Station are wheelchair accessible. The stations both have lifts but may require ramp access to board trains. There is some off street, free parking but none that I am aware of that is designated to the Albany. Some of the nearby roads aren't well paved for wheelchair access, although these are fine if coming directly from the train stations. During Deptford Market (day time Wed, Fri, Sat) Deptford High Street is very busy with stalls, although people are generally polite about making way for wheelchair users. Clean and gender neutral, if I remember correctly. Bus and taxi"
the albert halls stirling,negative,We didn't use them - but looked ok although on the small side
the albert halls stirling,positive,Parking directly outside the venue The Albert Halls are in a fairly central location and easy to get to. If coming from the train station and not in a power chair it would probably be best to avoid the route past The Golden Lion hotel and Corn Exchange Road as this is on quite a steep hill. Instead go to the end of the pedestrian zone and turn right up Albert Place it Is a slightly longer route but far more level.  There are blue badge parking spaces within the small level car park in front of the hall. (Some of the parking area is cobbled surface) There are also on street parking options on Albert Place / Dumbarton Road itself and in the nearby Kings Park area but be warned there is quite a camber on some of the roads around the Kings Park area and also a local permit holder scheme in operation during the day until 5:30pm. 
the alchemist manchester,positive,I don't know about parking as we walked but the bar is near lots of public transport and there are nice wide pavements outside.
the alexander graham bell edinburgh,positive,I got off the bus on Princes Street and George Street is just behind. There is drop off spots for buses and taxis infront of the door. There is limited parking outside but I came on wheels so unsure how that works. Many buses stop on Princes St which is parallel to George Street. These are on the left hand side across from the bar. RADAR key required. Enough space for myself in a powerchair and one companion but it was quite tight. Handrails and red cord are there and mirror above sink
the almanack kenilworth,positive,Accessible toilet easy to find from the restaurant
the alnwick garden alnwick,positive,"Free disability car parking is provided at the Alnwick Gardens. Staff direct you to the nearest available parking space, and also provide mobility scooters and wheelchairs at the disabled car park if they have been booked out for hire. Mobility scooter and wheelchair route maps are explained and provided when hiring out their use for the Alnwick Garden. The entrance to the gardens is only a short one to two minutes walking distance from the disabled car park. There were several disabled toilet facilities throughout the gardens, within the gift shop and in the Pavilion Restaurant and Café. The toilets were clean and had plenty of room to manoeuvre around, with grab-rails present as well. The toilets in the Pavilion Café were downstairs but lifts were provided for accessibility with a mobility scooter, wheelchair or pram. There is a train station and local buses in Alnwick.  Alnwick Gardens was well organised for disabled visitors arriving by car. There is a whole car-park dedicated to 'blue badge' holders and this is the closest to the main entrance.   There were accessible toilets at several places throughout the gardens.  These seemed well looked after. Good disabled car park within a few metres of the ticket booth. I went to a disabled loo that was excellent, but didn't check for a changing-places loo. I didn't expect to be writing a review, so I will pay more attention in future! We drove, went to the wrong car park and were shown how to get to the special disabled car park It was easy to find, plenty of room The blue badge car park is separate to the main car park. Its right next to the door and is free to park. The car park for non blue badge holders is across the road and has a daily charge.  Only issue I had was the blue badge car park is in the same place as the coach drop off area. Not so much of a problem until the coaches park right on the drop kerb so wheelchairs can't get up! I had to ask one to move so I could access the kerb but they did so it was ok. Toilets are accessible. They are not massive but enough room for a powerchair.  They don't have a radar lock so unfortunately everyone can use them which of course means they are easily abused by people who would rather not queue for the ladies/gents. Parking  was very good with a good number of disabled bays  An attendant showed us were to park and then a guide escorted us up to the entrance.   We arrived when the Gardens opened so perhaps we were fortunate to get such assistance.  The gradient up to the entrance was fairly steep.  Wheelchairs and mobiklity scooters can be borrowed if one phone in advance I can nly say that I saw two different disabled toilets on my visit but I did not use either and rtherefore feel unable to score properly.  The doors looked wide though. Blue badge holders car park is beside the wonderful Treehouse Restaurant with pathways leading to all areas within the garden. There are accessible toilets throughout the garden"
the alpaca trekking centre thornhill,negative,"Again as this attraction is still in the early stages and being built, there are no toilet facilities yet. The owner offered us the use of the toilet in his own private caravan. If you need an accessible toilet I believe the nearest one would be at Trossachs Woollen Mill, Kilmahog, Callander FK17 8HD which is only about 15 minutes away. The owner is currently building a visitor centre and cafe, which I'd imagine will have an accessible toilet."
the alpaca trekking centre thornhill,positive,"The site is still being developed so there is no set parking as such. However, when we arrived the owner guided us through the gate and let us park directly outside the barn door. This was ideal was us."
the ambassadors   new victoria theatre woking,negative,There are blue badge bays on the side of the multi-storey nearest the theatre but it's still some way to the theatre (inside the Peacock Centre) and you have to pay (the pay station is quite complicated and it's expensive).
the anchor dundee,negative,"The Anchor does have a disabled toilet however, it isn’t very spacious if someone needs assistance from someone else. There is no changing place toilet though. Down at the beach in Broughty Ferry there is a changing place although, it is only open till 5pm in the Summer and 3:30pm in the Winter."
the anchor dundee,positive,"There is a council car park next door and other carparks/on street parking nearby, a taxi rank is also nearby. There are also plenty of buses that pass through Broughty Ferry on regular basis. A train station is also situated in Broughty Ferry although I don’t know anything about how often they stop, I know it’s not that much though."
the anchor inn sidmouth,positive,Sidmouth doesn't have a railway station. The 9 or 9A bus from Exeter takes about 35 - 45 minutes and stops at the Sidmouth Triangle. There are other local bus services that go to Sidmouth. The pub is a couple of minutes from the bus stop.
the anchorage leverburgh,negative,"You can park near the door, though the car park is a little uneven. We didn't see any separate  disabled parking spaces."
the anchorage leverburgh,positive,"Completely accessible , plenty rails, room for carer"
the angel london,negative,The pub is near some bus stops & taxis do drop people off outside. The nearest tube stations are not wheelchair accessible.
the anne rowling regenerative neurology clinic edinburgh,positive,"Parking great - there is dedicated blue badge parking for the clinic just outside the door. Currently the bus stops are at the other end of the hospital as there is lots of building work going on. Gold standard - see photo. It's possible to park almost outside with a short walk to the door if you're a blue badge holder. Accessible buses serve the hospital campus and they're currently some distance away as you have to walk through the hospital. There's more than one accessible loo. The toilet I used was massive, loads of grab rails, automatic taps, and spotlessly clean. The door to get in was super wide and easy to operate."
the apartment edinburgh,positive,Fine - on the same level as the entrance.
the apex bury saint edmunds,positive,"There is parking nearby on a surface carpark. Blue Badge holders have to pay, but they get twice the time for thier money. Otherwise there is underground parking with several disabled spaces asnd a lift to the ground floor. The lift is operable by the wheelchair user but is only just big enough to accommodate a companion. There is loo downstairs but I am not sure if this is accessible, but on the first floor the accessible toilet can be accessed via an internal lift."
the appleby hub appleby in westmorland,positive,"The free carpark is beside the church, but only has 3 dedicated disabled spaces and two of those with hatch markings. One occasion we were unlucky with the dedicated places but I have a rear ramp so just used another space.  Spotlessly clean. Lots of room, transfer from the right. Lowered handbasin and well stocked. Decent handrail to the left. No complaints at all."
the arch cafe leeds,negative,"The café is next to Sainsbury's so it is very close to buses to Headingley, Chapel Allerton, Oakwood and many more. However, for disabled parking there are only 2 spots directly outside the café with a few more outside St John's shopping centre. All the toilets are in the adjoined AgeUK offices downstairs. The disabled toilet is accessible with no problems."
the arches glasgow,positive,Big accessible loo but door was VERY heavy and hard to do on your own.   Has a radar key but staff in cloakroom (which is beside the loo) have one too and were b friendly and helpful.   Loo was very smelly though so pretty unpleasant.
the archivists garden edinburgh,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Close to Waverley Station and the bus stops of Princes Street, and now (2015) not far from St Andrew Square tram stop. There is a disabled toilet and a cafe in Register House, which is wheelchair accessible."
the arden hotel stratford upon avon,positive,Large Hotel car park at rear of Hotel with disabeld parking bays. large accessable loo with grab rails very easy to find.
the ark restaurant paisley,negative,"There is one disabled parking space and one other at the door but lots of local roadside parking available. Public transport available close-by, bus stop at end of street and railway station (Paisley Gilmour Street) within half a mile."
the art house wakefield,positive,- accessible changing place toilet with special bin for nappies etc - Euans guide red cord card in accessible bathroom  - Staff got shower chair for me when I asked - Accessible wet room in flat
the art of banksy london,negative,"We found a blue badge bay around 4 minutes away. It’s near Covent Garden and a very cobbled area.  If I could give zero stars I would. The accessible loo is in with all the stalls. It’s the last stall. Very small and the door opens inwards, which means as a wheelchair user I couldn’t shut the door so had to use the toilet with the door open and people coming in and out close by which was degrading and stressful. They hadn’t even considered getting advice on their ‘fully accessible’ exhibition. "
the art school glasgow,negative,"I walked about ten minutes from the bus station, not sure about parking. I know getting the bus there can be a bit awkward Accessible toilet down in basement, unfortunately I never went"
the art workers guild london,positive,"The nearest tube stations are Russell Square, Euston or Holborn, none of which are step free. The nearest step free tube station is King's Cross and from there you can get at 91 bus which, along with several other buses stop nearby.  On the ground floor there was an accessible toilet. Please note this was the only toilet I noticed when I visited the building. The toilet was spacious, clean and tidy. There were grab rails and an emergency cord, which when I arrived was tied to one of the grab rails. I undid the emergency cord and attached a Euan's Guide red cord card to it. If you use the toilet look at the mirror which has a William Morris quote on it, which is very appropriate for the Art Workers' Guild. It says ""If you can't learn to love real art at least learn to hate sham art""."
the babbacombe hotel torquay,positive,Some car parking spaces Bus stop about 50 yards away Train in the town Most guests arrived by coach
the bagel basket largs,positive,Excellent disabled toilet
the bakers arms poole,positive,"Clearly marked accessible bays, approximately 5 of them (?)  Clean and tidy toilet, not a changing places toilet though. Big enough to move about in but you could struggle if you had a lot of kit. "
the ball room sports bar edinburgh,positive,We drove. There is a very small carpark just outside the venue but there is no designated disabled parking. There are several bus stops close to the venue.
the balloon tree york,positive,Easy parking Easy to find . Clean
the ballroom cheltenham,negative,Walked to the restaurant which took 5 minutes. Standard disabled toilet
the bank isle of bute,negative,"Although an 'accessible toilet' does exist, it's not the biggest and doesn't have a red cord. Nevertheless, it does have a grab rail and is one of the few 'publicly accessible' accessible toilets on the island, when the building is open. "
the bank isle of bute,positive,"There are no accessible parking spaces directly outside the venue, however it's a very short distance from the Rothesay Ferry Terminal which has accessible parking. "
the baraset barn stratford upon avon,negative,"An ordinary toilet converted into disabled toilet, rather tight, no room for wheelchair, it had grab rails, but no pull cord seen. Clean and tidy though."
the baraset barn stratford upon avon,positive,"Just two miles out of Stratford apon Avon, large car park without any disabled bays, with a flat ride up to a long ramp leading into restaurant."
the bard and banker pub victoria,negative,"Downtown on a Main Street. Easy transit access, hopeless for private parking."
the bard and banker pub victoria,positive,Outstanding! Completely separate private room of a good size. The lost 1/2 star is because it's almost impossible to find and again it's a bit of a maze to get to it.
the barley mow london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby. The pub is just off Oxford Street, so zillions of buses are passing nearby all the time. There is an accessible toilet. During my visit I found that some thoughtless person had stacked a load of spare chairs in it (see my photo below), which made a sideways wheelchair-to-toilet transfer impossible. Accessible toilets are NOT store-rooms! All the available space is required by a wheelchair for manoeuvring and for transfer to the toilet."
the barn at assington sudbury,positive,Plenty of accessible and spacious parking. Really large with space for wheelchair user to transfer and carer if necessary.
the barn at beal berwick upon tweed,positive,"Large parking area, firm gravel, wide access ramp to the cafe with disabled bays adjacent to the ramp Large car-park with number of disabled parking spaces that has a ramp providing great wheelchair access.  Rather out-of-way so little if any public transport nearby. At end of restaurant. Well signed and very easy to find.  Hinged and wall-fixed grab rails provided. Not massive but large enough for carer to assist. It's a very popular venue, so the carparking area (which is vast!) can get a little crowded at lunchtime. The surface is gravelly, not paved with tarmac. Blue badge spaces close to building, on a gravel surface. All good once helped through the heavy door. Red cord tied up! We drove to Barn at Beal. There is a good sized carpark with several disabled parking bays which are situated just beside the ramp to access the building.  There is a disabled toilet which has an emergency red cord. See photo. "
the barony edinburgh,negative,"The number 8 bus goes right past the bar. Unknown to me they have an accessible loo, and I will take a picture the next time I'm in."
the base skatepark cic bognor regis,negative,No Changingplaces toilet but they do have a standard Disabled toilet
the base skatepark cic bognor regis,positive,Wheelchair parking right outside 
the bath arms warminster,negative,It is in the centre of Warminster for public transport is good however the whole of this area would be considered rural and it's not the same as being in a major city. There a good rail bus and taxi links but the Frequency may not be as you would wish. Parking for the Venue itself has one disabled room and therefore one disability accessible space but there is also a street based disabled access space almost immediately outside the front door. We did not have any problem in the seven days we were there This is Wetherspoon's public house so in the bar and restaurant downstairs it was an adequate disabled toilet but it did not have things like changing room facility just basic grab rails and slightly larger private toilet similar to those found in McDonald's restaurants however I was there as a hotel guest and had a fully accessible wet room 8 ft by 10 ft
the bath priory bath,positive,"There is parking outside the main entrance to the hotel.  The car park surface is gravel, not ideal for wheelchairs"
the battle of bannockburn visitor centre stirling,positive,"Right next to the Centre. Fine. Had a lift and use the disabled bays right outside the building. Great accessible loo. Plenty of disabled spaces near the entrance to the venue, with lots of space at the sides for getting in and out the car.  Free parking outside the visitor centre.  It's just off a main road so you could get there by bus. Great Disabled toilet with Euans guide card on the red cord Parking was good with wide enough bays to accommodate our WAV (wheelchair accessible vehicle) and room to wheel alongside each side of the car. It was as easy roll from the parking to the visitor centre's entrance being only around 50 meters away. Public transport might be more of a challenge as the main road where the buses run was some distance away. Although we did notice that there were some tour buses operating that may pull into the visitor centre complex. A large accessible toilet is located off the main corridor of the visitor centre. It has all the required facilities and was spotlessly clean and tidy."
the battle of britain memorial capel le ferne,positive,All parking is close but the closest are the blue badge bays on hard surface material linked to the pathway towards the door. Parking is free for badge holders. Modern clean toilet. Only difficulty might be the high paper towels and only a sanitary bin. See photo. Left a cord card as it was tied up. 
the baxters highland village fochabers,negative,Not enough space to manoeuvre so difficult. 
the baxters highland village fochabers,positive,Disabled parking close to the restaurant.
the beach house burntisland,positive,We travelled by car from Doncaster and parked just outside the main house. It was easy to reverse the car by The Beach House to unload.
the beach house edinburgh,positive,Good bus links and plenty of parking on street Other than difficulty with the door the disabled toilet is roomy and clean
the beacon eastbourne,negative,No transport for disabled - bare minimum disabled parking 
the beacon eastbourne,positive,"The Beacon is adjacent to Eastbourne train station and easy to find. On the street outside there are currently road works going on which means that some of the road is fenced off and there are limited crossing points. However, I will still give access 5 as this is temporary and the pavement outside is wide and the area is flat, so once the road works are over it should be easy to navigate. The taxi rank is close by, near the station. There is a Changing Places toilet and also 2 accessible toilets on the ground floor, see photo. They are in an area separate from the regular toilets. The accessible toilets require a radar key. They accessible toilet was spacious with grab rails and red emergency cord. Blue badge parking is available in the integral multi-storey car park and at nearby on-street parking areas. A second multi-storey car park nearby also has spaces for blue badge holders. Regular bus services pass by the front of the Beacon and an adjacent main line station housing taxi ranks provides for ease of access to transport facilities. As above "
the beacon museum whitehaven,positive,"free disabled parking at the venue. several accessible toilets all clean, with working emergency cords"
the bear cross bournemouth,negative,"Just one disabled parking space, but close to the entrance."
the bear inn hotel burwash,positive,"Pub has its own car park right by the back entrance from which there is step free access into the pub. Apart from having to go outside again, a modern spacious toilet, with red cord properly deployed - although the toilet paper was bizarrely high up the wall and may be out of reach for some. Does also double as a baby change."
the beardmore conference hotel clydebank,positive,Clean and plenty of room inside
the beatles story liverpool,negative,There are a number of Wheelchair accessible toilets available to use as you make your way round these did look like they were slightly  different in size   
the beatles story liverpool,positive,"Easy public transport and parking around Albert Docks as this is a major visitor destination.  Rail stations in the area.  On street blue badge parking is available but limited, although there is a Q-Park facility close by Based at the Albert Dock, there is plenty of parking. This is a stop on the tour bus as well. Fully accessible toilet with plenty of room."
the bedford hotel sidmouth,negative,The toilet in my room and the public ground floor toilets didn't have a grab rails. The toilets were clean.
the bedford hotel sidmouth,positive,Sidmouth doesn't have a train station but is do-able on public transport. There are step free buses from Exeter (9 or 9A) and the journey time is about 30 - 45 minutes. 
the belfry hotel resort sutton coldfield,negative,"We only saw ordinary men’s and ladies toilets, no disabled seen, and needed a long ride to reach them. I needed help to get back up a steep long ramp however, but Willing staff on hand as passing. I did not see grab rails or pull cords in the area of the hotel I was in "
the belfry hotel resort sutton coldfield,positive,"11 disabled bays available quite close to hotels entrance, and it’s on the level with a small slope to contend with."
the bell at skenfrith skenfrith,positive,"Spacious car park gave easy access .  No dedicated disabled space although probably not an issue Not sure there is any public transport  to this small village in the heart of Monmouthshire! Plenty of space , easy access and sufficient grab rails . Wheelchair accessible good sized basin was helpful too."
the bell haddington,positive,The car park is opposite the restaurant and you have to cross a busy road.  There are traffic lights 200 metres and we were lucky because cars were stopped for the red lights and let us through. The toilet was one of the best I have seen.  There was enough room to turn my wheelchair round.  Very clean.
the big adventure linwood,positive,Down the very back of the centre there is a disabled toilet. The toilet is large and spacious enough for a wheelchair and child or adult. Taps and hand dryers are at reach.
the big chill house london,negative,"This is possibly the smallest toilet I've ever used that was specifically billed as ""Accessible"". You can just about squeeze a wheelchair into the space and shut the door, but there's no room to turn around. I highly doubt a powerchair would actually fit. It makes transfers very tricky!  There were at least handrails on either side of the toilet, and the emergency call cord was in a reachable position. There was also a mop in the corner, blocking my access to the hand dryer. So be warned on that front."
the big chill house london,positive,"This pub is just round the corner from Kings Cross station, and all the roads you have to cross have dropped kerbs and traffic lights, making the trip fairly straightforward, except for navigating through the crowds..."
the big red barn company biggar,positive,"3 accessible parking bays - paved and a paved pathway to the door (25 metres). There is a large accessible toilet.    Whilst not exactly a Changing Places Toilet, it is well above the standard that I encounter on an everyday basis. I made a couple of suggestions and the  owner said that she would deal with them.  Although there was a  pull cord, it had broken off about 6 inches from the ceiling of the toilet.  I was assured that this would be dealt with immediately - will check on next visit."
the big sleep eastbourne,negative,Disabled parking around the front and side of the hotel along with on the opposite side of the road.
the big sleep eastbourne,positive,On the opposite of the square there is a large disabled parking bay The disabled en-suite was bigger than the room and the room was plenty roomy in itself. We had a twin disabled room.
the bijou by the sea buckie,negative,"Once inside they had all the rails expected. No red cord, bin in the way of transferring  and such a tight entrance you had to exit backwards failing the corridor before you could turn around."
the bijou by the sea buckie,positive,Carpark right outside but only one disabled space.
the birnam inn dunkeld,negative,"parking right outside, no specific reserved parking no accessible toilet"
the bishops palace wells,positive,"We were staying at The Swan Hotel just opposite the Cathedral, so it was just a quick wheel away. It was easy to find, large enough with grab rails galore. Lots of space.Easy to find.  Clean."
the bistro at vaughans kitchen devizes,negative,No disabled loo. All loos are downstairs so of no use to wheelchair users.
the bistro at vaughans kitchen devizes,positive,Disabled parking spaces in car park 2 mins wheel away
the black boy pub solihull,negative,"We give one star as unable to advice on what toilets were like, there is a disabled toilet, but it needs a key to be collected from bar, and it seemed staff were more concerned about hiding than wanting to help, so we left it."
the black boy pub solihull,positive,"Parking is of no problem, and although only two disabled bays, there is ample parking spaces. Coming along an inviting driveway you arrive right outside the entrance for the pub."
the black bull edinburgh,negative,RADAR key required. The lock is a bit jerky (reported to staff on Dec 31st). Limited space - one wheelchair and an assistant would maybe struggle. Handrails on both sides and red cord on right hand side - although this does not reach the ground. Space under sink to roll under. The toilet opens onto the main floor so no corridors or tight spaces to move around. 
the black horse inn maidstone,positive,"Plenty of parking, including opposite  the rooms. They aren't proper 'disabled' bays but may have been designated for residents - can't remember - but you could also park right outside the rooms. Carpark had rather a slope to it.  Sorry, didn't use the pub loo but the bathroom in the accommodation was OK if you don't need too many grabrails - I would have preferred some more. There was just one to the right of the loo and the left of the shower seat as you sat on them. (See photos) There were two sinks, one lower than the other."
the black prince woodstock,negative,"There is plenty of parking, however there is no dedicated Blue Badge spaces. Parking is near the entrance. "
the black rose tavern edinburgh,negative,There is no disabled access toilet though is accessible for those with cane or walking supports.
the black rose tavern edinburgh,positive,"Rose Street is in the Center of the Newtown, buses, trams are 100m and there are ample parking bays with usual blue badge consideration. Rose Street is however pedestrianised, it’s cobbled and one has to take care in walking."
the black sheep dublin,positive,Capel Street has a number of wheelchair parking spots to avail of. They have a wheelchair bathroom at the back of the bar (next to the board game table). It requires a reverse job in as the door opens inwards but it is big. Accessible parking is available on the street Door opens inwards but very large room with grab rails etc.
the blackbird bar and restaurant edinburgh,negative,See photo.  The disabled toilet is small and it is almost impossible to close the door  behind you  when entering in a wheelchair. There is also not enough room for a carer  to help.
the blackpool tower blackpool,negative,The nearest parking would be available at the Hounds Hill shopping centre around 10mins away I did not visit the parking area during this visit. The tram stop is just across the road from the tower as is local bus services as well There was a few disabled toilets around but was unable to find changing places toilet. I used one disabled toilet that was very unclean nappy in the sink and overflowing nappy bins which it was very dirty. Needed cleaning
the blackpool tower blackpool,positive,"There is a multi-storey car park a short distance from the tower, with accessible parking spaces  but the tram stops just outside the tower. The tram is accessible and has flat doorways to just wheel straight on. There were accessible toilets that had grab rails and easily signed, they were fine, there were accessible toilets on a few floors A number of good accessible toilets Radar key required Excellent disabled access for wheelchairs on the tram system with friendly staff. Clean & accessible on all levels visited. There is no parking. We arrived by tram. The tram & tram stop were easy to use, the tram staff were kind & helpful. The tram stop is a short distance from the tower. Please note that the accessible entrance is at the back of the building not at the front, that's the part that faces the prom, but it was level access & easy to find. Mum who is a wheelchair user used the radar key operated loo on the ground floor. There were 2 side by side, I think the one that we didn't use might double up as a baby changing room. The loo Mum used was clean, roomy & had grab rails."
the blackpool tramway blackpool,negative,Parking is an issue in Blackpool and there are restrictions in places . Most of the large hotels have there own car park if you are staying in Blackpool might be better to leave car  and use trams. The travel card that you can purchase to cover days is also accepted on the bus as well.
the blacksmith arms york,positive,"Although there is parking provided there are no specific disabled bays, however there is plenty of space within the car park.  The disabled toilets are located towards the back of the pub near the rear entrance. They are spacious enough to manoeuvre around easily."
the blacksmiths arms york,positive,"The disabled toilets are spacious allowing room to manoeuvre, and are accessible towards the rear entrance."
the blakeney hotel blakeney,positive,There is a dedicated blue badge parking space right beside the door. Blakeney is right by the sea in rural Norfolk so public transport is a lot trickier! There was an accessible loo opposite reception - clean & spacious... Only one issue - unfortunately the emergency cord was cut off at so nowhere near the floor & rendering it pretty useless!
the blenheim dawlish,positive,"The Blenheim is a level 2 - 3 minute walk from Dawlish Railway Station. There is step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station. From the train station you can see The Blenheim, an imposing pink, Victorian house. and its an easy level walk to the accommodation. Their website says ""There is metered parking along marine parade which is free from 6pm – 9am.  Blue Badge holders can park there free of charge 24hrs a day. Other parking include the Dawlish train station car park less than a 3 minute walk and free residential parking 5 minute walk away."" I had a toilet with a single grab rail on the right hand side in my en suite. The toilet there is slightly low but is was comfortable and manageable to use due to the grab rail. "
the bloated mallard hampton hill,negative,There is no disabled parking There is no disabled toilets
the block gasket burgess hill,positive,"Taxi rank seconds away, as are bus stops from Brighton and Haywards Heath, and it's five minutes (if that) from Burgess Hill Train Station. Easy access, incredibly clean."
the blue bell inn sandbach,negative,"There are no disabled parking spaces as the whole car park is a typical rustic country inn but there is lots of space and you need to choose your best spot. Car park is hardcore but not too difficult to push a wheelchair on. Can get busy on hot days as there is a beer garden (no ramp to the garden), so parking may be more difficult."
the blue bell inn sandbach,positive,Very good access Accessed from a single door to a corridor into a very big disabled toilet. Plenty of room for the wheelchair.
the blue house durham,positive,"The car park is level and well maintained with a well marked disable bay easy to find loo, well signed plenty of space."
the bluebell peterborough,positive,There is a designated space in the car park next to the accessible room. The only downside is the gravel surface but a powered wheelchair coped with it.
the bluebird cafe by the lake coniston,negative,Parking - think ithere were 3. Clean & tidy  Accessible for wheelchair 
the bluebird cafe by the lake coniston,positive,Enough space for a wheelchair and carer. Spotlessly clean. Wide doors and enough grab rails.
the boarding house howwood,positive,"Disabled parking available, wheelchair access via the ale house entrance. The staff at the venue are happy to organise an appropriate taxi home if necessary The loo is easily accessible, clearly signposted and beautifully appointed, with mirrors at appropriate heights and sturdy handrails. The emergency pull reaches just above the floor. Everything is very clean and 'grown-up' - what a joy!"
the boardwalk falkirk,positive,"the loos are easy to find. No radar key needed. Plenty of grab rails, Space for me to manoeuvre manual wheelchair"
the boat house ellesmere,positive,Parking space right outside the front of the cafe. Spaces depending on how busy the cafe is. However 2 larger car parks close by (opposite and 200m down the flat road) and roadside parking also.   Disabled toilet. Easy to get to. Spacious area outside the toilets for waiting.
the boatman windsor,positive,"4 disabled parking spots right near pub that also serve the train station.  Not sure about bus access but it is right by Windsor Riverside train station. We drove, but got the following access info for the station off of trainline: “ There is level access to all platforms until around 20:00. After 20:00 access to the station is via three steps and wheelchair users may require assistance.”"
the bond hotel blackpool blackpool,positive,"Hotel has own car park, it is a bit small but we had no problems Very accessible toilets downstairs, with all the grab rails and room you need.  Upstairs our room had a hoist, and could transfer onto a toilet seat and then go through to toilet. The location is just set back off the promenade and it has a bus route just outside of the hotel. The hotel provide a door to door service from anywhere in the UK. There is a car park located behind the hotel in which there is a lot of room for large vehicles to park.  Make sure advanced bookings are made as they do not often take people who turn up. It is very close to the pleasure beach and the sandcastle water park, which are two of the most visited places in Blackpool The toilet facilities were very easy to find and they were very spacious and private. The height of the sink was great for wheelchair users and the toilet had adjustments around it for assistance. The bathroom was really nice and didn't feel clinical at all (like some accessible hotels have felt in the past). There was a shower seat and the whole bathroom was very clean. Bathrooms in the bedrooms were second to none, the wet floor system was the icing on the cake for accessibility. The hotel can arrange door to door transport at extra cost, we did not use this. There is parking at the rear of the hotel. When the car park is busy it is possible that cars will need to be parked one behind another, however, if your car is parked at the back, reception ask that you leave your car key so that if the car in front needs to be moved & you are not available, they can do this. This is a reasonable request. Most of the hotels have small car parks & this seems to be standard practice. When we were staying the car park was quiet. There are dropped curbs from the car park into reception. The loo on the ground floor near our room was for the use of all guests & was huge, spotless, had everything thing I would expect. In our bedroom we had an accessible wet room. This was spotless & kept clean for the duration of our 3 night stay. One end had the shower which had 2 robust grab rails. The shower head was height adjustable the controls were easy to use & once set the temperature stayed constant. In the middle was a smallish basin with little shelf & mirror. The other end had the loo & a pull down grab rail. The door to the wet room was a sliding one & easy to open & close. One very tiny improvement would have been a hook to hang clothes, bathrobe or towel out of the wet. Read above"
the boness kinneil railway boness,positive,"There is a car park at the station with plenty of space. Be warned - Bo'ness is quite a hilly place and the road we took that lead to the station from the bus stop was extremely steep.  If you're thinking of travelling to the Bo'ness end of the railway via public transport, before visiting I'd recommend researching local buses/taxi firms if you're a wheelchar user, or would struggle with steep inclines. The station had a large car park with about 8 disabled bays next to the ramp that takes you into the station building.  There was a lot of disabled parking spaces.  There was really good access to disabled toilets which were easy to find and clean. There was plenty of disabled parking."
the bonham hotel edinburgh,positive, If you have a disabled blue badge then you can park on the single yellow line outside the hotel.  Alternatively there is a small carpark behind the hotel which has one disabled space. The accessible toilet is on the ground floor. It is  large  so there is plenty of room to manoeuvre a wheelchair and have a carer in with you. There is also an  emergency red cord.
the bonnie badger gullane,negative,"It is on the main street.  No parking outside.  We found parking.  Going East towards Edinburgh, turn first right, first right again and there is plenty of parking.  It is about 300 metres along a quiet footpath."
the bonnie badger gullane,positive,Good quality fittings as you'd expect from an establishment of this type. We drove to the Bonnie Badgers and parked on a nearby side street.  There is a bus stop just outside the hotel but there is no train station in Gullane.  There is a disabled toilet on the ground floor. It is spacious and has an emergency red card cord.
the book warehouse london,negative,There are no step-free stations nearby but several bus routes serve the area. I wouldn't dream of trying to park anywhere nearby.
the booking office edinburgh,negative,No immediate parking or public transport to Waverley Bridge but that's down to geography. If you're self propelling or being pushed by a carer you'll need to be able to negotiate a steep incline from/to Princes Street. Perhaps a better option is to park in Jeffrey Street or Market Street. There is no parking available but as it is situated on Waverley Bridge it easy to access from any bus going to Princes Street or train going to Waverley. We used a taxicab to get to the venue. No disabled parking but a prime location for Princes street public transport.
the booking office edinburgh,positive,"Thumbs up as per the earlier reviews and photos. Only minor quibble as previously mentioned was poor location of toilet roll holder. If they can fix this it'll be perfect. The Changing Places toilet is easier to find than the Male / Female toilets downstairs. It is brand new with plenty of room, height adjustable plinth, hoist with loop attachments and toilet with handrails. On street city centre parking is never too easy,  but opposite 100 bus terminus and very close to Prince's Street buses so easy from that point of view. Easily the most roomy disabled toilet in existence.  6 power chairs could do a formation dancing routine inside! Very spacious room. Closmat height adjustable sink and changing table. Ceiling track hoist. Have docked 0.5 because the toilet roll dispenser is typically badly placed.....far away and low!"
the boot room sports cafe   anfield liverpool,negative,There is only one accessible toilet it is located next to the ladies and gents and is off to the left next to the bar area. The Wheelchair toilet is also the baby change area the toilet has grip rails on both sides and it is a bit tight and there is no room for a care giver.  
the boot room sports cafe   anfield liverpool,positive,There is parking available at the ground and in the streets around the stadium its self so you should not have to far to go. There is also a Taxi Rank just out side the gates of the stadium and a local tour bus that runs from the Albert Dock area stops just out side the gates a number of local buses also stop next to or near the stadium 
the botanist leeds,negative,"On the small side, and lacking a full changing station."
the botanist sheffield,positive,"We parked very close, in the disabled spaces attached to the City Hall. It was great to be so close, but scowly faces at Sheffield City Council, who are messing with all the roads in the city centre, making actually getting to the City Hall quite a feat at the moment. "
the bothy bar pitlochry,negative,Accessible toilets were adequate with enough space when inside. A larger powered wheelchair may have some difficulty though.
the bothy bar pitlochry,positive,"Rail - The unmanned train station that serves this little village is only 2 minute walk away although I am unsure if this is wheelchair accessible. Bus - there is a bus stop directly opposite the hotel that serves the village but unsure of the type of service provided. Car -  good amount of car park space directly outside the hotel.  The surface is lose gravel, although quite easy go on wit a wheelchair. It is a little uneven if ambulant."
the bothy bistro burghead,negative,"The ladies toilet was also the wheelchair accessible toilet.  The toilet itself was clean, spacious and had wall bars etc. but a powerchair would be unable to to access it without moving highchairs etc. which were stored behind the door as they obviously have a problem with storage.  The staff offered to move the highchairs for me to get in.   "
the bothy bistro burghead,positive,Parking outside on the street but no disabled parking at the actual venue that I was aware of but there is a lowered kerb and it was easy to park.  There is also a car park nearby.
the bothy restaurant perth,positive,"Plenty of council car parks nearby that blue badge holders are able to park in for free. There is also some on street parking however, there were road works when I was there. Train station is nearby and bus stops around the city centre. I’m not from Perth so don’t know which ones exactly.  Disabled toilet is an okay size however, too many things around toilet which would mean some people may struggle to transfer. These things could be moved though, apart from the sink. See photo below.   I hung an emergency red cord card.  Didn't go by car but there are spaces fairly close by.  There is a multi storey car park but this isn't free for blue badge holders.  There is some on street parking close 250 yards away.   It is right next to most of the local bus services. I didn't use the toilet but there is one available and is on the level floor."
the bowes museum barnard castle,positive,"Disabled parking is at the rear of the premises. Local taxis serve the area but there is no railway station at Barnard Castle, the nearest main line station is Darlington 20 miles away.  I do not know any details of any bus  service to the Museum but buses do go to Barnard Castle from Darlington. and one could get a taxi to the Museum from the town centre. I drove from Darlington which was an easy journey of about 20 miles. Brilliant Toilets on Ground and upper floor.  Easy access and roomy, but most important spotlessly clean! They were well fitted with Grab rails and there was space for a carer. There is one disabled toilet at the side beside stores and the kitchen. It is raised loo and has grab bars and a 'paperclip'. It is big enough for a wheelchair."
the brandon works motherwell,negative,"Quite difficult to find, lack of signage. RADAR key required. There was only enough room for me in my powerchair which was okay as I can transfer independently but I still felt it cosy. Red cord hanging to the floor which is fab. Sink has space to roll under. There were two bins against the wall that made it look more cluttered ( Accessible toilet is also a baby change)"
the brandon works motherwell,positive,"Car parking is behind the venue, buses pass nearby and taxis can also stop nearby. It is level access from these drop off points into the venue."
the bricklayers arms shamley green,negative,"The bus stops in the village but not right outside. You really need to drive here. It's a shame there are no disabled spaces in the car park (the spaces are tightly packed, so whilst we've rarely been unable to park it's difficult to open the door as wide as I'd like).  There's a ramp from the car park to pub level then a short path to the rear door."
the bricklayers arms shamley green,positive,"Lovely -if a bit jaded- loo.  All necessary grab rails and alarm cord. Nice wide doorway, clearly labelled, plenty of room to turn a chair inside."
the brickyard nottingham,positive,"Well it's on a main bus route and just over the road are 2 free to park car parks, normally 2hrs free but in the evenings it's just free to use."
the bridal dressing rooms portsmouth,positive,"Plenty of on street parking, and car parks "
the brighton hotel brighton,negative,There is NO wheelchair toilet in Reception just a wheelchair wetroom indside room
the brighton hotel brighton,positive,"The Parking is first come first serve, but we parked outside the front doors of Hotel overlooking the Sea easily but there is a charge of £18"
the bristol hippodrome bristol,negative,No parking for the venue but the side street has on street parking for blue badge holders so it is fairly easy to find a spot It’s not a bad toilet. But there’s only one and everyone uses it regardless of it being a disabled toilet. 
the bristol hippodrome bristol,positive,"No hoist, standard disabled loo but you'll have to fight the healthies for the loo at break time as they don't want to wait for the normal toilets On bus routes. Free on street parking for blue badge holders or a multi story very near for everyone else. "
the british library london,positive,"The British Library is on Euston Road next door next door to St Pancras Station and close to King's Cross and Euston Stations. There are also a number of bus routes that stop outside the library. I travelled on public transport. There are disabled accessible doors on all floors, with power assisted doors for easy opening. Some of them are located inside the main toilet blocks and others are separately located. They are clearly sign posted. Toilets have emergency alarms and grab rails. On two separate occasions when I visited the emergency cord was not reaching the floor, I reported it to staff, and on my most recent visit the cord touched the floor. The toilets are usually very clean but on my last occasion one of the disabled toilets had a very wet floor. I reported this to a member of staff and they immediately got on the phone to their cleaning department.  There was a gentleman using it he carried his computer out with him. He was young and not all disabilities are visable so I shall give him the benefit of the doubt. It was clean. Easy to use. Very set up for the mobile disabled but no changing table for more disabled folk.  The British Library is on Euston Road next door next door to St Pancras Station and close to King's Cross and Euston Stations. Nearby is King's Cross tube station which is step free. Euston tube station is not step free and Euston Square tube station is only step free west bound. There are also a number of bus routes that stop outside the library. I travelled by bus. There is a bus stop directly outside and one the opposite side of the street. I used the accessible toilet on the first floor which has power assisted doors. The toilet was spacious and with grab rails. There was an emergency cord but it was clipped onto one of the grab rails so I unhooked it. The toilet was very clean and tidy.  Please note there is a Changing Places toilet at King's Cross Railway Station about 3-5 minutes walk way."
the broomhouse centre edinburgh,positive,"Parking is available in the adjacent streets. Bus services pass along the nearby main road (150m). There is an accessible loo and it is fairly large with the expected features. Spotlessly clean, grab rails, and bright and light. Not immediately obvious as regards location but staff will show you if you ask."
the brunch club liverpool,positive,"Nearest bus station 3 or 4 minutes walk and plenty of on street parking. Didn't use any transport as staying nearby , but think it wouldn't be a problem at all spacious and clean disabled toilet"
the bull hotel fairford,negative,"Only one designated disabled parking space which was occupied when we were there. This is just because of location, as all the parking is limited, but worth knowing.  Unsure about public transport but I suspect it is limited, based on location."
the bungo bar kitchen glasgow,negative,"There is parking outside the venue but this is perpendicular to the pavement which can cause problems to people who need plenty of room to enter/exit the car. There are bus stops on the main road not far from the entrance. The accessible toilet is large enough to turn your wheelchair. As you may or may not be able to see from my poor picture the flush is on the side nearest the wall, it's a bit of a pet hate of mine but on the whole a nice clean toilet. There are grab rails if you need.  "
the butchers arms pub oxford,negative,Streets around are narrow and not the easiest. You can park in a resident's only bay if you have a blue badge. Buses to Headington are regular and accessible but the pub is in a residential area off the main road.
the cafe at ridgeway newport,negative,"No parking, but you can park on the road right outside. There is a large disabled toilet, but only 1 toilet for everyone."
the cafe at st marys lichfield,negative,The only thing is that the corridor in the toilets wouldn’t be wide enough for wheelchairs and equipment that we may need to use because the corridor was very narrow. Non wheelchair users will be ok to get down and around the corridor.
the caledonian inverness,positive,See above
the caley picture house edinburgh,negative,"There are some disabled parking spaces in the streets behind and the nearest bus stops at the bottom of Lothian Road are close by. Space for a career, grab rails and easily found from the one floor of this venue which is accessible (that's if the lift is working) Not aware of any nearby parking.On Lothian Buses, the venue can be accessed easily by buses: 11, 36, 16, 47, 10, 34. X15, 124, 24, X5, 15."
the caley picture house edinburgh,positive,Accessible toilet is on floor 1 and opened by a RADAR KEY. Staff members are very helpful and more than happy to help with opening doors when you ask for a key. The loo has handrails on each side and a red cord that touches the floor. 
the caley sample room edinburgh,negative,"It's on a fairly busy road, however there are other residential side streets that you might be able to find a spot. I am very confused, they have 2 male toilets, one on the same wall as the bar and the other next to the female toilets, however no disabled toilets! Why the men need 2 but wheelchair user have none is beyond me. Also within the regular toilets they are very tight, no way a wheelchair user could make it in."
the caley sample room edinburgh,positive,I came by bus and the venue is only a few metres from the bus stop. There is a wonky drop kerb but I bumped up this with ease in my powerchair. No key needed to enter. These are very clean and spacious. No Red Cord though.
the canmore house bar restaurant dunfermline,positive,"There are ample public car parks within a 5 min walk to Canmore House, not having used public transport to get to the restaurant I am not 1005 sure of where exactly the bus stops are but I can say they are 10 mins from the Centre of Dunfermline high street walking and about the same from Dunfermline town train station although you may want to get a taxi from the train station and I am sure that buses will pass on the street in front of Canmore house, it is 3 mins away from the Alhambra theatre "
the capital asset perth,negative,Car parks and on street parking fairly close by.  Is on a bus route.  Did not use transport on this occasion. Had to park on the street It was easy to find.  It was big enough to use comfortably.
the capital asset perth,positive,"Parking is available outside the pub on Tay Street and it is very close to all bus routes I. Perth  There is an excellent, spacious accessible toilet on the ground floor that is accessible with a radar key  Uses radar key.  Good size and everything that should be there is. Staff hold a radar key."
the captain alexander liverpool,positive,"No parking at this venue but Opposite James St Train station and Taxi Rank, Bus stop nearby and Q-park a 5 mins walk away Operated by Radar Key. Very clean and spacious inside with automatic tap and powerful hand dryer, sign on the outside window advertising there was an accessible toilet"
the captain james lang dumbarton,positive,"The pub is in the town centre and, as stated above, does not have its own car park but there is blue badge parking fairly close. There are two on-street spaces about 30 yards away. Sadly these are not well monitored and are often used by people who clearly think 'I'll just be 5 minutes' - and they are - but as soon as they have left another person drives up and does the same.   A better option is the car park alongside the river behind the pub. There are quite a number of blue badge spaces here and level access for a wheelchair from there to the pub. The pub's outdoor space is on this street but you can only get to it from the inside of the pub, so it's not a handy shortcut. The toilet has a RADAR key and of course the staff will provide one if necessary. It is probably a good idea to keep it locked as the other toilets are up a lot of stairs - almost a double flight - so people would be tempted to use the accessible toilet.  It is roomy enough for a wheelchair user and assistant. There are grips on both sides. The red cord hangs to the floor. It is very close to one of the grips and once my relative pulled it by accident. A member of staff appeared promptly - very reassuring."
the cardiff story cardiff,negative,"City centre venue in pedestrian area, so no parking available but lots of disabled spaces nearby in St Davids shopping centre.(approx 500m, charge). Big accessible loo via giant lift to basement, let down by fact door cannot be opened from inside by independent wheelchair user and flush out of reach from chair. "
the castle centre london,positive,"There are 4 disabled parking bays, there is currently no signage but it's on it's way! These will be Blue Badge parking spaces. The car park and drop off point is right outside the entrance. The nearest station is Elephant and Castle (Northern and Bakerloo line). There are multiple bus stops dotted around the Elephant and Castle area. The closest bus stop is about half a minute away.  There are accessible toilets on every floor and they are very well signed and easy to find  and also have 2 Changing Places toilets. 1 in the dry change and 1 in the wet change. There are also Baby changing facilities"
the castle hotel lincoln,positive,"Parked DIRECTLY outside the door of the accessible room. In wet room.  Personally, I would have preferred grab rails on either side of the toilet, but understand that may not be convenient for wheelchair users."
the castle tooting london,negative,"Tooting Broadway is the nearest tube station but it doesn't have any step-free access. The nearest station with any sort of step-free access is Balham, 1.3 miles away, and this station is step-free only for National Rail, not for Tube. Lots of buses serve the area around the pub and can drop you off nearby.   There is an accessible toilet, with RADAR lock. Staff behind the bar have the key, but had mislaid it when I was there. Luckily the door was open anyway. I was VERY dismayed to find that the rubbish bin had been placed in the wheelchair transfer area, blocking access to this essential space which should be kept clear at all times. Worse still, the red emergency cord had been tucked BEHIND the rubbish bin, so it's totally out of reach. This is very thoughtless, dangerous and silly. This cord must be easily accessible, hanging freely all the way to the floor, so that it can be reached by anyone who falls over, for example in the often perilous transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back. If I had fallen over and injured myself, I would not have been able to summon assistance. "
the catch at fins restaurant largs,positive,"You need to drive to get there, there is a fair amount of parking, no labelled disabled spaces (I think not anyway) but there's room to operate hoists etc There is a spacious gravel car park with some undercover parking also available in an open barn, and also round the back of the restaurant."
the cathedral of the isles isle of cumbrae,positive,There are parking spaces in the grounds of the cathedral we drove as we took our car on the ferry
the cavern club liverpool,negative,We drive to the venue in a wheelchair accessible car. The was no obvious place to park so we had to park on a street nearby and  walk a relatively short distance . It was not easy to find a space to park even with a blue badge.
the caves edinburgh,negative,"Bit out of the way from main bus route, about a 5 minute walk from the bridges. "
the caves edinburgh,positive,On street parking is plentiful. There are buses nearby however some of the hills can be tricky to negotiate in a wheelchair. There is a fully operational disabled toilet however it is right next to the main entrance so can be a bit difficult to manoeuvre amongst the loiterers. Photograph is included!
the central hotel donegal,negative,no disabled parking bus stop just outside  never found one
the centre livingston,negative,"The Centre is a bit off the beaten track but there is a lovely big car park with plenty of disabled bays, and public transport is also good (bus/Dial-a-bus &  Handicabs)."
the centre livingston,positive,"At the shopping center, there is disables parking bays to make the shops more accessible for blue badge holders. Livingston North train station is a ten-minute drive from Livingston shopping center which is accessible by wheelchair as it has ramps.  This shopping center has a number of spacious disables toilets available which were clean. Exceptional; easy to find, easy to use, decent size and clean."
the ceramic cafe dunfermline,negative,"No disabled parking, not on a public transport route, fair walk to nearest bus stop. Narrow paths. No lowered kerbs for access from car park to path Disabled toilet was very small, barley enough room for a wheelchair never mind space for my carer, extremely difficult to manouever chair to get in or out of the toilet."
the chalet dunbar,positive,"The parking is a large hard standing surface and there is a good ramp up to the front door no problems with access The disabled bathroom was well kitted out with tracking hoist a closomat toilet and spacious shower with shower chair. All the rooms were clean and tidy The Parking was great. We require hard standing due to having a tail lift. There was plenty of room . The toilet facilities were good. We used our own toilet/shower chair this did not go over the toilet( used commode pan,but this is usually what we need to do). But access was good. The parking is near the ramp to get into the chalet There is a bathroom with facilities for disables as you can see on their website. There is also a shower chair. There is space for a carer. Set in the countryside this is somewhere that really requires you to have your own transport. That said, you could come by train and then get taxi out to the farm if you wanted to. The reason I wanted to award five stars is because the parking has been considered in that it is a hard finished surface big enough for four vehicles and is immediately next to the Chalet. No trekking over gravel or heading along paths or obstacle courses to get to the door. If you want to take up the challenge and explore the farm you can easily drive from one part to another. The Chalet and the farm are only a short distance off the main A1 road so you are well placed for getting to the local sights and attractions, as well as popping to the supermarket for the essentials. The wet room was spacious, bright and well appointed. A Closomat toilet was an unexpected bonus. Alarm cords had been installed in the wet room, and bedroom, and gave reassurance that you could summon help if needed. The fixtures, fittings and colours used in the wet room were all modern and stylish without any hint of clinical or medical. If I'm honest - I was a tad jealous as I'd love a wet room like that at home! The parking space was very good and long enough for us to get the ramp out onto even ground from the van and get the young lady out safely "
the chalet tearooms restaurant keswick,positive,There is one larger than average accessible loo with grab rails and plenty of space to manoeuvre a wheelchair and space for a carer.  The toilet was very clean and tidy.
the chanter edinburgh,negative,"The toilets are past the bar. The accessible toilet door is extremely stiff so you may need help with that. Inside is accessible although quite snug. There is a red cord, however this does not reach the floor."
the chanter edinburgh,positive,"Taxi can drop off right outside on Bread Street. Bus stops on Lothian Road. Fine - plenty of space. Bit manky but it was an Edinburgh city centre pub on a Saturday night!  Had to laugh when the drunk guys coming out of the gents next door to the accessible loo gallantly held open the door of the gents for me, and I had to indicate that, as a woman, I wasn't actually going in there! The Chanter is just off Lothian Road which has a number of bus links. Parking is close by. There is no real parking on Bread Street but there is parking on surrounding street. Nearby Lothian road is serviced by many Edinburgh bus routes.  The accessible loo is to the left of the bar on the right. The loo is well equipped but it is a bit on the small side for those with larger wheel chairs.  Lots of good public transport options given proximity to Lothian Road (loads of buses) and the tram stops at the bottom of Lothian Road.  Parking is limited and best bet is to park on a single yellow line across the road if you have a blue badge. we parked on Grindlay Street.  There is an accessible loo but we didnt use it so cant really comment."
the charlecote pheasant hotel stratford upon avon,negative,"Enough bays for general parking, disabled bays may be for those using disabled chalets, but all reasonable close to hotel entrance. There are no disabled toilets in main hotel areas, just poor public toilets, with concerns. The disabled chalets do have disabled toilets, with walk in facilities, but very basic."
the charter market salisbury,positive,Central accessible toilet 
the charterhouse london,positive,"The nearest tube to Charterhouse is Barbican (which has stairs) or Farringdon (which is steps free). It is then a 5 minute walk to Charterhouse Square. There are cobblestones in the square. On entering the museum there are three sets of toilets. Very impressed. One for wheelchair users, which is spacious with grab rails and emergency cord. One with a sign on the door with a person with sticks, which has grab rails but no emergency cord. Another toilet door which I didn't check out. Forgot to check when I was in the Thackeray Café whether they had any toilets, accessible or otherwise."
the chartroom restaurant inverkip,negative, We drove to the restaurant and parked in the carpark (see photo).
the chartroom restaurant inverkip,positive,Wheelchair accessible but no emergency red cord. See photo.
the chelsea drugstore dublin 2,positive,"It's on George's Street in city centre, so not much parking but lots of transport options The bar is attached to the Market Bar, so you go through a door in the back of the bar to access their fully accessible bathroom which has handrails, lots of space, and even a low down mirror. The accessible bathroom also has baby changing facilities"
the chequers potterhanworth,negative,See above
the chinese manor house edinburgh,negative,"There is a car park, but the it is small & tight without a designated disabled space. A reasonable size for a person who can stand but tight to point of being un-usable if on wheels. "
the chop house edinburgh,negative,One accessible toilet available. Bizarrely there is no handle to open the door from the outside! High-chairs are stored in toilet which makes manoeuvring difficult. Plenty grab rails. No emergency cord. Easy to lock/open door handle once inside.
the chop house edinburgh,positive,Plenty on–street parking available on and around Constitution Street. There is lots of on street parking nearby.
the church at the old manse lanark,positive,First class - and plenty of them. 
the cider barn leominster,positive,"Easy to find, plenty of space, clean and space for carer."
the cilwendeg shell house hermitage boncath,negative,Car park was small and fubctional. No disabled places but to be honest I have never seen another car there. 
the city of london police museum london,positive,"The nearest tubes stations are Bank, which has some disabled access, and St Paul's, which isn't steps free. I travelled by bus and there are a number of bus routes that stop nearby and then it's a 5 minutes walk. On my return visit in October 2018 I was pleased to find that an accessible toilet has been recently installed in the basement, which is accessible by lift or stairs. The toilet is spacious, with grab rails and emergency cord. Previously staff have had to escort me to another part of the building to use the facilities. Really helpful improvement."
the cliff hotel spa cardigan,negative,There are no dedicated parking bays for disabled visitors.
the cliff hotel spa cardigan,positive,"This is where they excel. The disabled toilet is excellent. A large and spacious room, with grab handles and plenty of space to even manoeuvre my powered wheelchair. Every time I’ve visited it’s been clean. "
the cliffs hotel blackpool,negative,Car
the cliffs hotel blackpool,positive,"Yes, good."
the climbing hangar sheffield,positive,"There are two disabled spaces right next to the door. I’ve never had a problem grabbing one at any time of day.  If you don’t have a blue badge, there are about 4 spaces near the door and a bigger car park just over the road, all on the flat. Woohoo! Huge room, door is light and not weighted to shut on you. It’s also a wet room with a shower chair. Emergency cord is always free. Clean. Excellent."
the clipper restaurant poole,positive,Parking in the Multi-storey is fairly good for disabled drivers/passengers. Spaces are monitored and offenders are ticketed.
the clock tower cakery restaurant sidmouth,positive,"Sidmouth doesn't have a railway station. The 9 or 9A bus from Exeter takes about 35 - 45 minutes and stops at the Sidmouth Triangle. There are other local bus services that go to Sidmouth. In the summer season the Sidmouth Hopper Bus stops at various points of interest in the town, it is step free and has a space for a wheelchair user. From the Sidmouth Triangle, where most of the buses stop, it only takes a couple of minutes to the step free entrance of Connaught Gardens.   I'm not sure if there is a toilet accessible or not in the restaurant. However in the gardens there is a disabled toilet which requires a radar key."
the cluny 2 newcastle upon tyne,negative,"Buses dont run that close to the venue and it is located on a very steep bank, so could be difficult for some people to reach. Parking is limited and I did not see any disabled parking, although there may be some that I just did not pass or was full. A lot of the parking is on steep banks, we parked on Lime street. Buses do run from Newcastle city centre to about half a mile away the numbers 12, 39, 40,  62 - you need to get off the bus at the stop before the Tanners arms. It is supposedly a 7 minute walk according to google maps."
the co operative food carnoustie,positive,There is a car park with many disabled parking spaces.
the co operative food derby,negative,No public transport access. Three marked disabled bays outside. There was tactile pavement in car park. 
the co operative food edinburgh,negative,There is a bus stop opposite coming from Princes Street and a bus stop heading to Princes street about 100 metres up the road.   There is a carpark around the back of the supermarket with disabled parking bays and a sloped entrance that takes you up the side of the building. It might be quite tight for some wheelchair users and has a fairly steep incline for a manual wheelchair user.
the co operative food edinburgh,positive,On street parking or dedicated disabled bays by the nearby library.
the co operative food swindon,positive,I got a bus to here which stops directly across the road near a crossing. There is a stop for buses in the opposite direction just outside the store. They have a car park with designated disabled parking bays.
the coach house ford park ulverston,positive,"We travelled by car, there were no designated disabled spaces but parking was sufficient, carrying on from the main carpark there are several spaces opposite the old house, these are slightly nearer the cafe"
the cock inn headley,negative,"Now, I haven't used the toilets. However, I am reliably informed by staff that there is one - and I've no reason to doubt them. Given how accessible the rest of the establishment is, it would be a massive oversight for the toilet not to be a toilet - and for it not to be of a good standard. The pub was also renovated at quite considerable cost, approx. 18 months ago: http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/headley-hill-pub-revert-original-8675805"
the cock inn headley,positive,The disabled car parking is described as being 'in the top car park'' by the lift I referred to above. On my first visit this did take a while to find hence why I referred to the pub as being deceptive accessible.
the cock inn hotel sheering,positive,Easy parking and easy access into the bedrooms from the carpark. The toilet was easily accessible but the room only had a bath in the bathroom and no shower for disabled individuals.
the cocoabean chocolate factory twynholm,positive,No transport links to the factory but good blue badge parking next to the entrance.
the coffee club restaurant glasgow,positive,"Plenty of parking outside with a good number of disabled parking bays.  There is a bus stop located nearby but couldn't say how frequent the service was. One disabled toilet next to the doors through to the coffee shop. Looked clean and, most importantly, free of clutter!"
the coffee inn dublin,positive,Accessible large bathroom
the coffee pot aviemore,negative,"There is some parking around the rear of the building - but Aviemore is quite small and compact, so parking anywhere within the town can lead you swiftly to The Coffee Pot. "
the coffee pot aviemore,positive,"Nice and spacious, but no red emergency cord. There is a grab rail, however. Certainly enough space to fit a wheelchair in. "
the collection lincoln,positive,There is a Pay and display car park right outside the museum with 4 disabled parking spaces. The last time I went here the disabled spaces were all taken up so I had to park in a normal space. It would be useful if there were some more spaces. There are 2 disabled toilets. One accessible toilet is downstairs and can be accessed by the lift. There was a decent amount of room inside for my carer and I. Probably not enough for me to turn around but it was manageable.   The 2nd disabled toilet is in the orientation hall of the museum.
the colosseum rome,negative,"Best approached on foot (although 'unpredictable' public transport does run). I counted two in total - all well sign-posted and although I personally did not avail myself, I am informed they are both a decent size & well appointed."
the colosseum rome,positive,"We walked to the Colosseum, but later in the trip we began to use the metro and there is a very convenient stop immediately outside the entrance. There are some streets close to the Colosseum where you can find disabled parking. Buses and some trams also stop close to it. We used the buses to get there so don't have any experience of driving or parking in Rome. Buses were easily accessible for my partner, and staff were all very helpful."
the commissioners quay inn blyth,positive,There are a number of disabled parking bays near to the entry of the ‘Pub with rooms’.   It was good to find level access from the parking area to the pavement.
the commodore vintage inn helensburgh,positive,We arrived by train and this is a flat walk along from the station. I am sure there is ample parking but we didn't use it. The accessible loo is in the pub area and very easy to get to and to get in and out of. Disabled parking to front and rear. Bus from Glasgow terminal beside hotel. 1.5 miles from railway station. One wheelchair access loo in main bar/food area
the compass edinburgh,negative,"Good buses 12 and 16 and the bottom of Leith Walk is about a 4 minute walk. See picture The accessible toilet is in quite a tight corner of the restaurant and the door opens outward at an awkward angle. Wheelchair users may require some assistance getting into the room. Inside, the toilet is spacious, however there is no emergency red cord and the hand dryer is on the opposite wall from the sink which isn't ideal. It is clean and tidy however, and there are no oversized bins which is good."
the complete flooring co bristol,negative,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately away near Waitrose on Link Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
the corinthian club glasgow,negative,It is in central Glasgow with all those restrictions you would respect with very limited on-street parking but with some local public transport including Queen Street station close by. Also no parking directly outside the main entrance means getting in and out of cabs made easier
the corner house frome,positive,Large car park at the rear.  No problems here
the cornerstone lancaster,positive,There is a divorced car park with lots of disabled spaces. It is on a bus route and located within the city centre. The hoist in the toilet was out of order due to a flat battery. This was flagged up to staff who responded positively.
the corryvreckan oban,negative,The nearest parking is some distance away back along the Pier itself. It is in this area that you will find links to public transport including bus and train
the cosy club bath,positive,"Clean and tidy accessible loo, easy to find and access."
the cosy club cardiff,negative,nearby multi-storeys
the cosy club cardiff,positive,St David's Car Park is very close. The accessible loo is very easy to find. There is a toddler-sized changing mat. quite roomy with grab rails Trains buses and public car parks all available.  Excellent dedicated disabled toilet Large accessible loo. A bit dark.
the cosy club leeds,positive,There is one disabled toilet and this is towards the back of the restaurant by the other toilets. The toilet had reasonable manoeuvrable space but you might struggle in a very large wheelchair. There were grab rails available. The disabled toilet was clean and tidy and checked regularly. The pull cord went to the floor. It was also the location for baby changing but there are no adult changing facilities available. 
the cottage loaf llandudno,negative,Parking on street.
the cottages at muston grange farm filey,positive,You can park outside the house but the paving is uneven and there is a small slope that is quite steep. There is a bus stop outside the park so you don't have to walk far to get a bus. The bathroom is very roomy with plenty of space for wheelchairs and carers. The shower is a walk in and has a chair. The toilet has grab rails around but is low.
the counter at the delaunay london,positive,"The nearest tube stations are Holborn, Covent Garden or Charing Cross. As it's located on the Aldwych there are several buses that stop directly outside of the café. I travelled on public transport. There is a large, disabled accessible toilet with grab rails and alarm. The nearest tube stations are Holborn, Covent Garden or Charing Cross. Unfortunately none of which are step free. The restaurant is on the Aldwych so there are many buses that stop directly outside or close to the restaurant.  There is a spacious, accessible toilet with grab rails and alarm. It was very clean and tidy when I used it. It smelt like it had recently been washed during our mid-afternoon visit."
the counter dublin,positive,"No accessible parking outside, near Trinity Luas stop Need to get staff member to show you as it's down past the kitchen. Sometimes require people to move as it's narrow down the back."
the counting house glasgow,negative,"Did not use the toilets but it was unclear as to where the disabled toilets are located, only signs for male and female which require you to go downstairs. Need to ask staff to find out. "
the counting house glasgow,positive,"We didnt park I got the train to Queen Street and walked down, 5 minutes maximum. Plenty of buses also pass the restaurant and parking is available at george square and surrounding areas.  There are bus stops all round George Square so public bus took me straight there."
the courtyard cafe at st johns lancaster,positive,Although we walked there are ample disabled car parking spaces close to the entrance. The bus stop is just outside and travels in both directions. The toilets were good - spacious and clean
the craighalbert centre dullatur,positive,"Parking is available on site.  The nearest railway connection is Croy Station and there are local accessible bus services. The accessible toilet I used was large, very well equipped, bright and light, and spotlessly clean."
the craven arms settle,positive,Giggleswick station is within relatively easy walking distance (across the road). It is unstaffed but step free. The West bound platform requires crossing the line on a barrow crossing. Level access from the station car park is via an unlit access road and as short stint along a mainish road with no pavement. There is a car park. Didn't notice any disabled parking. I didn't actually go in. From the outside it looks perfectly fine.
the cross keys york,negative,"The pub has no parking itself, although it is only a short distance to various city centre car parks and the various bus routes in York. There is an accessible toilet with rails etc, but it is accessed via a narrow corridor, then you have to turn immediately right to get in to the toilet, which is quite small and you would probably need to reverse out as there is not enough room to turn around. The door opens outwards so there is room to get your wheelchair in"
the cross keys york,positive,"The accessible toilet is very spacious, with good lighting and hand rails in appropriate places. There are lowered mirrors enabling wheelchair users to see themselves which is often overlooked!  The accessible toilet is also home to the pub's only baby changing facilities - as such, it may sometimes be quite busy.  However, the staff are good at ensuring the toilet is kept clean and well stocked."
the crossed peels stirling,positive,"There are 2 entrances, one on the lower floor coming in from Baker Street and then another to the upper level from Spittal Street. There was a disabled bay immediately in front of the Baker Street entrance - see photo- but it’s central Stirling so is quite likely to often be occupied. The train and bus station is about a 15 mins walk but uphill!  We had parked in the thistle centre car park and walked up. Still a bit of a climb.  Good sized , clean and even had a red cord that reached the floor! "
the crown at mickleton mickleton,positive,Accessible loo wasn't separately signed - it just said Toilets. But that's fine - I look forward to the time when all loos include an accessible one automatically! This one had all necessary grab rails and alarm cord. Really smart and clean.
the cruin arden,negative,There was a car park with plenty of space when we visited but I expect that it could become very busy at times. There were no marked spaces and so I feel it would benefit from having a few marked accessible spaces. The road leading up to the restaurant is in quite a poor condition with lots of potholes. 
the crystal palace glasgow,negative,Parking not available directly outside although there is a q park across the road
the crystal palace glasgow,positive,Access toilet both floors 
the cumberland bar edinburgh,negative,A bit of a walk  from Broughton Street and Dundas Street
the cuthbert brodrick leeds,negative,City centre pedestrian location. 
the cuthbert brodrick leeds,positive,"Well thought out. Not posh but included red cord correctly set, coat hook on door, sanitary bin at narrow side of toilet leaving wide side clear for right to left side transfer. No spring on door and rail on door to assist opening and closing.  It's in town, so good for public transport, but unsure where exactly the accessible parking spaces would be.  Easy to find the toilet, clean and well equipped. "
the daffodil inn llandysul,positive,A spacious car park with a dedicated disabled bay. Excellent toilets.
the dairy shop sidmouth,positive,"Sidmouth doesn't have a railway station. The 9 or 9A bus from Exeter takes about 35 - 45 minutes and stops at the Sidmouth Triangle, round the corner from the Dairy Shop. They have toilets but I didn't use them. However there is an accessible toilet requiring radar key, round the corner from the cafe at the Sidmouth Triangle. "
the dairyman brentwood,negative,"The pub is in the High Street and has no dedicated parking. Disabled parking is available outside Iceland, about 200 metres away. Additional disabled car park in William Hunter Way"
the dairyman brentwood,positive,Toilets large and clean
the dalton square practice lancaster,negative,"Limited parking outside on Dalton Square, but there is parking a short distance a way in Lancaster city council car parks "
the deaf institute manchester,negative,"There are no disabled toilets. I couldn't even get near the ladies toilet in my chair due to the bar and sound booth creating a narrow space. Even if I had, the cubicles and washing area are tiny: I struggled with a stick. I think the men's was back down several flights of stairs, so we didn't see them."
the deaf institute manchester,positive,"It's on a regular bus route and near several large car parks. We parked at the Aquatic Centre, which is 5 minutes away."
the dean tavern newtongrange,positive,No restricted parking on the street so can park right outside The disabled toilet of the restaurant complies however - when I first used this space was still a struggle when trying to transfer family member from chair to toilet. There is however a bigger toilet off the the bar area which allowed for three of us and the wheelchair.
the deep hull,negative,"Toilets were quite small. We asked if there was a toilet with a change bed and were told we could use the change bed in the first aid room when we needed to (we used it before leaving and it was fine). Score would have been higher if disabled toilet was bigger but was we were pleased we could use the change bed in the first aid room so still deserved a fairly decent score. The only area for improvement is the toilets.  They are clearly signposted and placed all around the site so no chance of delays and possible accidents as a result, but they are small.  The ‘crew’ team will offer assistance and there is the use of the first aid room to change Annie if I’d needed to, avoiding the humiliation of changing her on the deck!  Usual equipment in the loo, clean and tidy."
the deep hull,positive,"Lots of accessible parking. The venue had several free disabled parking spaces. There were disabled toilets on each floor. Disabled parking available that is free of charge. There are disabled toilets are available on each floor of the deep, toilets have emergency alarms fitted. Designated disabled parking spaces if you have a blue badge. There is a parking fee. There is also a drop-off point which has a dropped kerb. All the carpark is on an even level. There are disabled toilets but some are a bit on the small size if you're in a large power chair or mobility scooter. There is a 'changing place' with lots of equipment - just remember to pack your radar key to access it. Signage is good as far as In can remember. There was grab rails and a red cord but I did have to remind staff to leave the red cord hanging free to the floor. It was clean and in the bigger toilets and changing place there was room for my carer(s). There are disabled car parking spaces which are free.  There are disabled toilets on each floor however, sometimes not as tidy or clean as preferred but are shown that they are cleaned regularly through charts shown on the walls and doors of the toilets.  It doesn’t get any better than this.  Met at the entrance by a welcoming marshal who directed us to the disabled parking bays next to the entrance, a dedicated entrance for disabled visitors where we found level access, loads of spaces and clearly marked signage stating ‘free parking for disabled.’ I don't know about transport but there where quite a few disabled parking bays which were wider than the normal parking spaces. Parking with a disabled badge was free. What was nice was that there were three disabled toilets each at a different level. One near the entrance, one by picnic area/cafe and one by the restaurant cafe on the top floor."
the den london,negative,"At The Den there is no parking for away fans but the stewards found space for us to park in the coach parking to keep us away from the Millwall fans due to their reputation. It was quite a long way to go from Sheffield so not many disabled away fans travelled to the game, which meant it was very easy for us to find a space. The only thing is that if your club took a lot of fans then it might be a bit difficult so make sure you get there very early. The disabled toilet is located in the bottom corner of the stand, fortunately not in home territory! However there is only one toilet, which could mean queues and it is dated and very narrow so is not that great for access. If your mobility is more limited than that of myself then you will struggle. Be prepared! "
the deptford lounge london,positive,"Very close to Deptford Rail Station, which is wheelchair accessible and has a lift. 10 minutes to Deptford Bridge DLR, which also is wheelchair accessible (although once when I was at this station with a wheelchair user the lift was broken and we could not travel)."
the derwent pencil museum keswick,negative,"The pencil museum was re-built after the floods in 2015, and whoever decided to build the toilets outside of the main museum needs their head examined!  To access the toilets, you have to leave the building via the main entrance and walk outside the length of the building to get to the toilet block at the far end.  It rains in Keswick.  A lot!  So you are likely to get wet if you need to go to the loo whilst visiting the museum.  Entrance to the accessible toilet is via a ramp (see photo).  I was disappointed to see that my wheelchair access to the toilet was blocked by a large bin placed under a sign that stated the bin was for nappys only.  I was not able to move the bin, so had to go out and ask my carer to move it for me.  Whilst I appreciate many accessible loos are dual-use and double up as baby changing rooms, placement of nappy bins needs to be considered so that they do not block access for wheelchair users.  The toilet was clean and tidy with a sink, but no hand drying options as the hand dryers are located in the ladies toilet area!"
the derwent pencil museum keswick,positive,"There is a large car park immediately outside the museum so ample parking is available, but only a couple of marked disabled bays.  This is a pay and display car park that is free for blue badge holders."
the devils porridge museum eastriggs,positive,"I drove here. There were plenty of parking spaces when I visited, including some designated spaces for blue badge holders. I am not sure about public transport links and did not explore the surrounding area. Large car park to front of museum with blue badge spaces and lowered pavement. Spotlessly clean....ample space for a carer. Well signposted. The door did stick a bit on the carpet so my hubby needed to give it a shove. We travelled by car, 2 dedicated accessible spaces near the entrance , plenty of parking The museum is on the main Dumfries/Annan to Carlisle bus route, with a regular service passing the museum  Clean & tidy,  roomy, but had to move bins to manoeuvre my chair around Red cord down to floor, Euan’s Guide red cord card already in situ. If you are visiting the café after the museum, and need the loo, then try and go before you go to the café, as no loo in the café, and you have to go back round the museum to access the loo. "
the devils punchbowl hindhead,positive,"It's quite well equipped though dated. The loo seat was very loose and difficult to sit on,  the layout wasn't ideal with barely enough room to manoeuvre the wheelchair inside - I reversed out.  It's position at the foot of the staircase was difficult if people were using the stairs.  The door was a bit tricky to lock (I had to twist in the chair as I couldn't fully turn the chair. However I'm jolly pleased they had a disabled loo and applaud them for that - it's located in the entrance hall at the base of the staircase.  Whilst there's a sign on the door, signage from the bar would be helpful."
the devonshire cat sheffield,positive,Disabled parking spaces are available on the streets next to the pub. Bus and tram stops are less than 5 minutes away. A good-sized disabled toilet is on the ground floor.
the dickens inn middlesbrough,negative,It is located on the Teesside University Campus so parking is very limited
the diner london,negative,"There is an accessible toilet but it loses two stars. One star because the red emergency cord is MUCH too short, as you can see in my photo below. It should reach all the way to the floor so that it can be pulled if anyone falls to the floor in the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back. This really is terribly thoughtless. Another star is lost because the door opens into the toilet in such a way that it's very very difficult to both be in the toilet cubicle AND open and shut the door. There just isn't quite enough room to do this without a struggle."
the dining room kirkcaldy,negative,Car park at rear is muddy and gravely (not great for wheelchairs). Plenty on-street parking available immediately outside.
the dining room kirkcaldy,positive,One accessible loo available at the rear of restaurant. Plenty grab rails. Good amount of room to manoeuvre.
the dirty onion belfast,negative,It's in the heart of the Catherdal Quarter.  Not great parking but not too out of the way. 
the discovery cardiff,negative,Limited parking in front with no dedicated disabled space.  On-street and large carpark next door. Clearly marked accessible loo but access via 2 doors needed assistance and reverse exit.
the dockyard social glasgow,positive,Drove and got parked across the road. Easy access by bus. 
the dolphin betchworth,negative,"Great loo, clean, spacious, handrails etc. BUT someone thought they'd store the baby high chairs in there - so could barely get my wheel in let alone manoeuvre it, had to lunge across the room for the grab rail and couldn't get to the hand drier at all. Bad form!"
the dolphin betchworth,positive,We drove but I understand there Is a bus service to Betchworth (not sure how close it gets to the pub).  Blue badge bay was right outside the entrance with easy access. I only deducted that half a star on a technicality as there is only one space.
the dome edinburgh,positive,Very close to Waverly station. Good accessible toilet. A bit hard to manoeuvre on your own as the corridor is narrow and the doors are heavy. 
the donkey sanctuary leeds leeds,positive,You would need a car to get here as it is a remote location. The Sanctuary has a visitor car park with dedicated disabled driver spaces.  Adequate toilet with left to right transfer. All rails needed 
the donkey sanctuary manchester,positive,"Car park is great - flat and plenty of room, though no allocated accessible bays.   It is a bit far from the city centre but there are regular buses from Stockport, Chorlton & Ashton that stop almost outside. Perfect.  Range of facilities including ceiling track hoist and changing bed"
the donkey sanctuary sidmouth,positive,"In the summer season the Sidmouth Hopper Bus stops in the car park just by the entrance. Where you get off the bus is a board telling you the times the bus stops there and there is regular buses throughout the day. The hopper bus is step free and has a space for a wheelchair user. There is a public car park next to the visitors' centre which had designated disabled parking spaces. There are accessible toilets, these are spacious with grab rails and emergency cord. Toilets were clean. There is no changing places toilet."
the dormy clubhouse bar grill gleneagles,positive,"If you're coming by car, you turn into the main Gleneagles Hotel driveway  and it's before you get to the hotel on the left hand side. There is a Blue Badge parking space right outside the Dormy House. If you're coming by train the nearest station is Gleneagles station. Great loo - very spacious!"
the douglas hotel brodick,positive,You can drive up to and park close to the main entrance. All tarmac. There are 2 accessible toilets  fitted with grab rails near the restaurant and bar.
the dr martens store london,negative,"Zillions of buses go up and down Oxford Street. There are no step-free stations nearby, though if you're very patient you could wait until Bond Street Station becomes step-free some time in the next five years. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area. "
the dropping well dublin,positive,Good accessible loo in the main pub.
the dry dock leeds,negative,"Small, lacking in full changing facilities, awkward to get into due to over-lapping doors (You have to open one, go through, let it close behind you, then open the next one). The disabled loo is behind the door for the womens bathroom, but is gender neutral. While there is a disabled access toilet it is within the female toilets which presents a real problem for men who want to use it. The toilet seat is also loose which can be tricky but there is a decent amount of space within the toilet itself. Can be difficult to shut the door to the female toilets and the accessible toilet at the same time. "
the dry dock leeds,positive,"Since I walked to the Dry Dock, I am not of provisions for disabled parking. However, since the pub is right opposite Leeds Beckett University in the City Centre, there are plenty of bus options that are available.  The accessible loo is located near the drinks counter. It has side rails and is spacious too. "
the duck inn kings lynn,positive,"Car park is right outside The Duck Inn should not have any problems parking Regular spacious multiuse toilet, "
the duke of wellington london,negative,"Nearest step-free tube station is Green Park. Buses will drop you off a couple of blocks away in Shaftesbury Avenue. Three stars lost here for an otherwise *excellent* accessible toilet, because the staff often store big boxes and packing cases in the accessible toilet, not realising that the space in such a toilet is *not* spare, but is needed for wheelchair manoeuvring. Sometimes you can't even get inside the toilet because of all the stuff they store inside, right by the door! This is really terrible. And the accessible toilet door opens outwards onto another busy door, leading to frequent door-crashes."
the dukes lancaster,negative,It was a cold day and we had to park away from the building. However there were plenty of spaces near by and it was free to park with our blue badge. 
the dukes lancaster,positive,"The toilets were very spacious and clean both in the cafe and the round, they had alarm cords and arm rests. "
the dumfries larder dumfries,positive,"Situated on the pedestrianised High Street, but, several options for accessible car parking in the town centre, a few minutes walk away. Local buses stop a couple of minutes away, with seating in the pedestrianised are for a rest. It is permissible for local  accessible taxi services to drop you off in the pedestrianised areas"
the eagle coaching inn dundee,positive,"There are council car parks/on street parking close by and taxi rank is also nearby. There are also plenty of buses that pass through Broughty Ferry on regular basis. A train station is also situated in Broughty Ferry although I don’t know anything about how often they stop, I know it’s not that much though. There is a disabled toilet in this pub however the sign on the door says ladies. I feel this will put some people off using it though as guys may not want to use a toilet for ladies, I think the sign should be changed to a disabled sign so not to cause confusion.  Overall the disabled toilet is quite spacious, although you would not be able to transfer from both sides of the toilet."
the eagle market derby,negative,Toilet was clean (in past it hasn't been). Accessed using a radar key. Grab rails are of a contrasting colour around toilet and sink. No hand soap. Toilet was right hand transfer and the emergency cord reached floor (it used to be cut short). Toilet has a large paddle flush and sink is a lever tap. Enough space for a carer too. 
the eagle market derby,positive,Parking and public transport facilities are the same as for Derby Intu. The entrance to Eagle Market is a short walk from Derby Bus Station and the taxi rank. Shop Mobility is also attached to the Eagle Market.
the earl haig club cardiff,positive,I can't fault this. It was spotless and had plenty of room for a carer.
the edinburgh bow tie company edinburgh,negative,Rose Street is largely pedestrianised with some through traffic. Lots of buses on neighbouring Princes Street and George Street. No parking that I know of at the venue. 
the ellerby country inn ellerby,positive,The rear carpark has a smooth gently sloped path through the attractive garden into the hotel. The double doors that open onto the car park do have a very short but steep slope immediately in front of the doors which can be a challenge after one too many ! My advice is to use the garden entrance. The accessible loo is adjacent to the other toilets and easy to find. The door is wide and easy for me to open and close from my wheelchair. Once inside there is plenty of room to transfer with plenty of supports and grab handles. The room has always been very clean on every occasion that I have used it.
the elm tree tearoom chacewater,positive,"There are several disabled spaces right next to the entrance, but it's a small gravel carpark so you could park anywhere and be within easy reach of it. There is an accessible loo multiple hand rails and two sinks and different heights. It was clean and had a bin. Out in the country side, the cafe is on the edge of fields with adequate parking. Disabled spaces are by the door."
the emirates arena cafe glasgow,negative,"Its a hard one to judge here. Great if you drive as there are lots of bays, but there is no public transport to the Arena, which I find very weird given how new and big the facility is.  I was told by Traveline that the nearest bus stops at the forge, which is 10-15mins up the hill, so not ideal at all."
the emirates arena cafe glasgow,positive,There is a good accessible loo just beside the cafe
the empress of broughton street edinburgh,negative,"I wouldn't drive here are the on-street parking isn't good. The buses are good however, and it's close to York Place tram stop!"
the engine house visitor education centre highley,positive,"Flat, tarmac carpark with blue badge spaces. (Our Sat-nav went badly wrong in this area and their are road sign to warn drivers). You can get to it by car or steam railway but the car journey was quick enough from Bridgnorth. Entry is free with your rail ticket on that day. One accessible toilet - a modern build,  which is the proud owner of a Red Cord Card."
the engine shed stirling,negative,"You have to park a bit away as there is no disabled parking space close to the entrance.  Easy to access from station or nearby carpark if you can walk or have wheels.  It is very regrettable that this £11M publicly funded project was designed by HES without disabled parking bays or a drop-off facility.  Shore Road which runs by the Engine Shed is a narrow ( one lane in places with a chicane ) and busy bus route and even after being dropped off by my wife in Shore Rd, I found the walk around the building to the main entrance, some 60 plus metres to be challenging.  There is a disabled parking lay-by on the access road parallel to the railway which is obviously an 'afterthought' by the developers and Stirling Council as it is a considerable distance away and has to compete with train users and patrons of the several adjacent restaurants and cinema. Needless to say  such an arrangement does not take account of our Scottish climate. If one was using a motorised chair,  access might at a pinch be straightforward, but overall, it is extremely disappointing and disadvantages the disabled, although there are spaces at the building  for unloading and a 'pool' car for HES staff........ It is difficult to see how it has complied with the Equality Act."
the engine shed stirling,positive,"I had a quick look and it seemed okay but neither I or my friend have mobility issues so can't properly comment. Very spacious with lots of suitable rails. Red cord hanging free with red cord card on it. Spotlessly clean.  Right next to the train station and near the bus station. Spacious accessible toilet. Good size accessible toilets. The venues parking arrangements weren't too clear from the website information but a quick call made it clearer. There are two accessible parking bays nearby. The accessible toilet was easy to find, well signposted and large and spacious. It had all the facilities I would expect to see and worked well for me. This corner accessible WC was good for most users having a good mirror and colour contrasting toilet seat, but there were some obvious omissions or mistakes: - door signage was weak and should have been clearer with recognition for people with dementia - the door closer was a little heavy - the flush handle was not to the centre of the room - there wasn't a colostomy shelf, but we were advised that this was being fitted - the walls were reflective as opposed to being contrasting with the rest of the fittings - all guardrails were bright chrome which gave the room a modern look at the expense of functionality (plastic fluted and colour contrasted is advisable)"
the esplanade hotel llandudno,negative,Parking at the back.
the esplanade hotel llandudno,positive,The hotel has a small car park behind it. There are several accessible toilets on the ground floor with plenty of room to manoeuvre. Toilets were adequate.
the esquire house glasgow,negative,"Accessable on the ground floor, key was kept behind the bar so remember to ask before you go.  Good room, plenty to fit a chair and clean."
the etches collection museum of jurassic marine life wareham,negative,"There are limited disabled parking spaces, but the whole car park is close to the venue. If busy the restaurant opposite allows overflow parking. A car or transport is a must as it is not easily accessible by public transport. It is country roads and in some places single lane with passing places. Parking from the restaurant, it is a very small slope and uneven in places but in a wheelchair is no problem. It is still only across the road - perhaps 50yards."
the etches collection museum of jurassic marine life wareham,positive,Opened only in 2016 the disabled facilities are modern .   Accessible toilets were more than adequate. Space for a carer if needed.
the exhibition rooms london,negative,"There is a drop-down rail in the toilet, which qualifies it as a disabled toilet. The toilet room is reasonably large. However, high chairs are stored in the toilet, which means it is often difficult to manoeuvre. It is difficult to close the door because there is no handle so must be pulled shut with the lock, which is high up and small. Really you need somebody to close the door behind you. I ask them to attach a piece of string to the lock so that the door could be pulled to but this never happened."
the extraordinary hare wantage,positive,"We drove and parked in one of the 2 disabled bays by the front door, but there is also lots of parking at the rear. There is a bus Stop ID: oxfamwmd right opposite it but it is not the easiest road to cross on foot."
the famous grouse experience crieff,negative,"The door is extremely heavy as it's spring loaded.  Space wise it is quite large however a wooden baby changing unit takes up a lot of space in the corner.  The toilet itself is very low, not of the standard comfort height."
the famous grouse experience crieff,positive,"Plenty of parking spaces, three of them are disabled.  No public transport runs up to the distillery, the nearest bus stop is 1/2 mile away."
the famous star hotel restaurant moffat,negative,Car no parking 
the farm stratford upon avon,positive,"A lovely countryside driving area, takes you to this farm, with a very large car park, laid with compressed chippings and easy to push around.  There are just two disabled bays, but all bays are easy enough to use."
the farndon boathouse farndon,negative,Good size for power chair left transfer on to toilet. Only problem is doors one to get in to toilet corridor the other directly behin to get in to disabled toilet so can cause issues.
the fat fox inn watlington,negative,"available, once you move the sofa and the highchair. Too small to turn round in."
the fat fox inn watlington,positive,"Rear car park, no fixed or marked bays, firm gravel surface"
the fighting cocks arreton,positive,"You would need to drive here I'd imagine. There's a big car park with two blue badge spaces. These were helpfully by the door. The car park is firmly surfaced and level but there's a small but steep ramp up to the patio which was tricky for my walker. Not a major issue, just something to be aware of and take your time with. There is a disabled loo adjacent to the main loos. It has a sign on the door though it's not visible from the main seating area. It is spacious and well equipped. The door is easy to lock and open. The loo has a push button flush which is trickier than a lever but it's a minor issue. It was a shame to find the alarm cord tied up out if the way - otherwise it would have been five stars. Good size large car park. Two disabled parking spaces but the car park is mostly even or flat. There are bus stops nearby with regular service. Good size disabled toilet. Grab bars throughout with arm rest that folds down by toilet."
the fire station sunderland,negative,I travelled to Sunderland by train. The venue and adjacent Premier Inn were a 10 minute roll through the pedestrianised shopping centre. 
the fire station sunderland,positive,"I used 2, one in the restaurant, the other in the auditorium. No push pads to open doors and maybe a couple more would be good, as there was a rush to use all the toilets at the start of the interval "
the fish people cafe glasgow,positive,"next door to underground station and close to bus stops; next to multi-storey car park and small on road parking area only toilet is a large disabled toilet with unimpeded access and no stored items in it. Clean and tidy with grab rails and accessible wash hand basin, etc."
the fishermans retreat ramsbottom,negative,"The venue has a few disabled spaces but the road to the Fisherman’s Retreat is very hilly with pot holes in the road and the car park, entrance and surrounding area is really hard to get round in a chair because of uneven paths and hills."
the fishermans retreat ramsbottom,positive,There are good-sized accessible toilets with grab rails in both the restaurant and function room.
the fitzwilliam museum cambridge,negative,"There is no parking at the museum. Limited on-street pay-and-display parking is available on Trumpington Street. The museum is approximately 10 minutes' walk from the city centre, where the Grand Arcade car park has accessible blue badge spaces, and accessible bus services pass down Trumpington Street."
the fitzwilliam museum cambridge,positive,"There is one accessible toilet, situated near the lift on the lower ground floor. It's reasonably well designed, with drop-down rails, and a door that opens both ways. However, on our last visit we found the accessible toilet being used at length by an able-bodied cyclist to change his clothes - having RADAR-key access would be an improvement! We were able to park immediately outside on a single yellow line with a disabled badge in our own bus"
the fleece bristol,negative,"We usually park on the road just round the corner from the venue, where there are spaces or you can park on double yellow lines with a blue badge.  Unfortunately this is a cobbled road :( Some buses go to/from Victoria Street just round the corner.  It's also about a mile from Bristol Temple Meads station. Good but no radar key (and not massively clean anyway)"
the fleece countryside inn barkisland,negative,They have parking round the back and front   No disabled toilets 
the flotterstone inn edinburgh,negative,"Car park is adjacent to venue, a short walk/push away - ample space therein. Public bus passes nearby too. Aright but a bit cramped and out of the way"
the fluke inverness,positive,"Spacy, easy to open manual door. Clean but not locked and open to public. Room for a carer."
the flying scotsman renfrew,positive,"Nice, newly tarmac'd carpark includes two disabled carparking spaces right opposite the main entrance. Disabled toilet is right at the end of the pub by the backdoor leading to the outdoor smoking area. When it is busy it can be difficult to negotiate a wheelchair through the pub to get to this loo. Expect to have to move several people out of your way! The toilet it's self is adequate. It's not the biggest toilet ever but it complies with legislation and is functional."
the foley arms stourbridge,positive,There is a disabled toilet but I've never used it I have only been in the general ladies toilet which is quite big.next visit I will check out the disabled toilet and update the review
the foot of the walk edinburgh,negative,On street parking but often busy. On street parking although a lot of yellow lines. Bus stops a short distance away.
the foot of the walk edinburgh,positive,There is an accessible loo. All the expected facilities and plenty of space.
the foresters arms beckington,positive,Street parking available.
the forge shopping centre glasgow,positive,"the parking is good when you can get a space as they always use the disabled spaces, also good bus links Their is only the disabled toilet up the stairs or within ASDA what can be a pain "
the fort hotel dundee,positive,"There are council car parks/on street parking close by and taxi rank is also nearby. There are also plenty of buses that pass through Broughty Ferry on regular basis. A train station is also situated in Broughty Ferry although I don’t know anything about how often they stop, I know it’s not that much though. There is a disabled toilet in The Fort and is spacious for a wheelchair and if they need assistance also but, there is no changing place toilet though. Down at the beach in Broughty Ferry there is a changing place although, it is only open till 5pm in the Summer and 3:30pm in the Winter."
the forum theatre barrow in furness,negative,"You need to park at the town hall. And pay at the town hall and parked it and the town hall. They need to be clean the toilets every day and they should be tidy at all the time and clean,"
the forum theatre barrow in furness,positive,"There is disabled  parking outside the Forum 28, Also a large car park not far away for parking and disabled parking. there is a bus stop out side the Forum 28. The toilets are very clean with plenty of room. Parking available in a disabled bay outside the cafe, ramps on the way into the building  The disabled toilet is easy to find and there are two available within the building, one upstairs and one downstairs."
the foundling museum london,positive,We went from Kings Cross - which is not too far away - and we had a lovely sunny stroll! Not sure what the accessible parking is like near the venue. Spacious and clean. From what I remember there were accessible loos on multiple floors.
the fountain bar edinburgh,negative,There is an accessible toilet between the bar and restaurant (it's also the baby changing facility). I didn't use the toilet so not able to report on what it's like inside.
the fountain bar edinburgh,positive,"We live close by so don't use any parking, however it's directly across from Fountain Park Cinema Complex which has plenty of disabled parking available. Large dedicated disabled toilets. There are a range of buses that stop very close by due to it being opposite the cinema complex, so there are good connections with the city centre.   There is a range of on street parking available as its a largely residential area and the Fountain Park complex has its own underground parking with disabled parking bays."
the four horseshoes chobham,negative,There's an adjacent parking area for the pub. No disabled spaces I could see.  Is alongside the pub so a bit of a trek to the front door. Don't know about buses. No parking right outside front door.
the fox letchworth garden city,negative,Toilets are easy to spot. Has many grab-bars and is very clean but is not very large. Fine for average scooter but too small for some larger powerchairs.
the fox letchworth garden city,positive,Has large car-park with at least two spaces for disabled. Rather remote site so little in way of public transport.
the fox on the hill london,negative,"There is an accessible toilet, the door is unlocked with a RADAR key. If you don't have a RADAR key, the bar staff have one. There were two great annoyances with this toilet. (1) The red emergency cord had been tied up in a complex way around a raised grabrail (see my photo). This is very silly and thoughtless. The red emergency cord must hang freely all the way to the floor at all times so that it can be reached by anyone who falls over in the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet & back. (2) There was an ENORMOUS bin in the way so there wasn't room to turn: VERY annoying."
the fox on the hill london,positive,"Denmark Hill London-Overground station is nearby and is fully step-free, and several bus routes serve the area too. The pub has a car park."
the full moon inn southwell,negative,Gravel car park no allocated spaces 
the fumbally dublin 8,positive,Accessible bathroom with handrails etc.
the furness building society stadium barrow in furness,negative,"there is disabled parking, they are every near the entrance. they have a bus stop near holker street near Asda and the train station 5 min walk there is a disabled toilet and they are very clean, tidy and room for a carer."
the gables hotel wotton under edge,negative,"We did not see any disabled toilet, just men’s or ladies, and you might have been able to get wheelchair in, but did not try it, then it’s just general toilet cubicles. We left it."
the gables hotel wotton under edge,positive,"The hotel lies on a main road, so it’s easy to drive to, and there are two disabled bays reasonably close to entrance. "
the galleria outlet shopping hatfield,positive,"We drove and there is free parking for Blue Badge holders. The spaces are spacious and it is easy to access the restaurants and the lift to the shops and cinema from them. Can only drive here from where I am, There are disabled spaces so you won’t need to use  lift or slopes to get to the upper level of shops and restaurants. There are limited spaces but I've never not been able to get one since I got my blue badge,  parking i free if you register your badge and car registration at the information desk (not sure if it's still staffed at present though)."
the garage glasgow,negative,There isn't close by parking near The Garage nightclub so would probably suggest taking a taxi to avoid a long walk to the club. 
the garage glasgow,positive,"In a nightclub, it is very good to half wheelchair access to the toilet next to the G2 room."
the garden gate london,negative,It is street parking and residential parking in this area. Small but fully functional disabled toilet.
the gardens of trauttmansdorff castle merano,negative,There is a bus/car park with disabled spaces although it is a fair treck to the Gardens' entrance.  It is inadvisable to arrive by anything other than foot as Merano is a bit out of the way. They were fine - but there weren't enough of them.  (And there was a bit of a scrum to access the one in the cafe.)
the gargunnock inn gargunnock,negative,"The main car park at the rear on Leckie Road leads to steep steps, so you need to go to the front door on Main Street for wheelchair access. There is on-street parking but not so much. It's only about 50m from the car park to the front door"
the gargunnock inn gargunnock,positive,They seemed fine
the gate arts community centre cardiff,negative,On-street parking only but one Disabled space at front of venue.
the gate arts community centre cardiff,positive,Accessible Loo available but not visited.
the gate newcastle upon tyne,positive,"Easily accessed via wheelchair/powerchair, car, bus or train due to being close-by to Northumberland Street, an undergound multi-storey car-park underneath the venue, Haymarket and Eldon Square bus stations and Newcastle Central Station. Most buses have ramps and there are a good number of disabled parking bays. Plentiful accessible toilets throughout the venue all with plenty of room for wheelchairs/powerchairs. Parking in 'The Gate' car park located underground. Access from china town.  A storied car park with plenty disabled car parking spaces. However this car park is popular and is usually very busy, especially on weekends.  There are public buses directly outside the gate entrance and run regularly. However, i would not recommend the metro system as the stations are quite a walk from the gate.  Public and disabled toilets are located on each floor. They are easily accessible and are generous in size. All disabled toilets are equipped with grab rails and the sink is positioned at a suitable height. "
the gateway restaurant edinburgh,positive,"There are dedicated blue badge bays at the West gate to the gardens.  No road to cross with lots of space for unloading wheelchairs, at the West Gate.  Regular buses at the East Gate, although this is a distance from the Gateway cafe.  There is another care at the East Gate, however I haven't been there. The accessible toilet was well sign posted, easy to find.  On the same level as the Restaurant. Grab rails, clean and tidy.  Had room to manoeuvre with walking frame. Only issue is it feels a fair distance to get to depending on where you are sitting in the Restaurant. Also accessibility toilets right at the entrance to the gardens, without the dreaded baby changing facilities.  Easy assess for wheelchairs with room to move."
the george hotel brasserie buckden saint neots,positive,Spacious and well signed blue badge parking. Clean and spacious accessible loo. The door opened inwards which would normally have been an issue but because of its size and layout it was fine. The fixtures and fittings kept with the rest of the decor and were shiny chrome. Full length mirror too. One thing that could have been improved was that the Red Cord seemed to have been cut off half way up so if she'd had a fall my pal wouldn't have been to call for help.
the gin palace dublin,positive,There is wheelchair parking on Strand Street and on Bachelors Walk We have one wheelchair bathroom here tucked away under the stairs and I had no problems with getting in and out of it.
the glassmaker bristol,negative,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately 200m away on Station Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
the glassmaker bristol,positive,Disabled access toilet with grab rails and baby changing unit.
the glassroom edinburgh,positive,"Buses stop around the corner and there is limited parking available outside Clean, basic and handy - no need to leave the hall to use the bathroom. It is very long and spacious. See pics for more"
the gleddoch house langbank,negative,no accessible bays at front entrance to hotel 3 bays at entrance to spa
the gleneagle hotel apartments killarney,positive,"There was plenty of parking outside the hotel, including several blue badge spaces. The hotel's accessible shuttle bus into the centre of Killarney worked well for my small scooter, and I understand this bus also goes to the local station, although I don't know about the access there. "
the glenturret distillery crieff,positive,4/5 disabled parking spots
the globe pub london,negative,"Baker Street Station is very nearby but is not step-free. However, if you can get out of your wheelchair, you can get all the way to street level via escalators. Zillions of buses serve the area. I don't know about parking but you certainly wouldn't try parking in the street in this area."
the glover arms perth,positive,"Easy to get to on the A85 from Perth to Crieff, bus stops right outside too.  Lots of parking, and a good number of disabled bays by the front door. Loo was easy to find, and not a bad size.  Had all the bits and bobs you needed, could just have been a little cleaner."
the goat dublin,positive,Accessible parking outside Loo with handrails in women's bathroom
the golden fleece chelmsford,positive,A large disabled toilet with easy access.
the golden lion hartlepool,positive,The toilets are situated directly across from the bar. There is one disabled access toilet which was clean and contained equipment such as grab rails all within wheelchair height and an alarm cord.
the golden lion hotel stirling,negative,Too small lack of room for wheelchair transfer or carer Lock on door was small and fiddly
the golden lion rochester,negative,They always sit ppl in front of doorways as this is a eating venue as well on both occassions if visited now one bring on a ptebooked Christmas meal toilet has had hurdles to consider before visiting toilet
the golden mile playa de la americas,positive,"Many people will likely be on their holidays and staying in a nearby hotel, so may not  require transport.   There are several small car parks in Last Americas each of which have several marked disabled spaces. In general, I noticed there are a few disabled parking bays on most of the main/bigger streets, including on the Golden Mile.  The local buses (green ones) all can lower to allow people on/off easier. They have two sets of doors, one at the front where the driver is, and another in the middle of the bus. The middle set are wider and would provide better access, there are marked disabled spaces within the buses  There are accessible toilets at the accessible beach in Las Americas and at several other points along the esplanade.  Several of the bigger shops/shopping centres also have accessible toilets.  I was not aware of any changing places toilets."
the golf inn gullane,negative,No Blue Badge parking outside.  Venue is on the High Street and there is a 45 minute restriction.  Visitors will need to offload and find unrestricted parking.  We parked a short distance round the corner.  There is a bus stop right outside the venue. See above
the golf inn gullane,positive,"I didn't use the toilets but my carer checked it out for future visits.  She said it was massive, enough room to turn round a wheelchair. Might be a bit small for large wheelchair. Fine for my light one."
the golfers rest north berwick,positive,Large disabled loo at the back of the pub .....see photos 
the goring hotel london,positive, We got a train from Clapham junction to Victoria .  From there it was a five minute walk to the Goring Hotel.  The disabled toilet is located on the fourth floor . It can be easily accessed by a wheelchair user by going in the lift. I have never been in such a luxurious  disabled toilet .  There is plenty of space . Instead of paper towels there proper hand towels. There is a  phone and emergency button at floor level if any  assistance is required .  An added bonus was that the decor was lovely .
the granary edinburgh,negative,Parking is on-street but very busy. Nearby bus stops provide an alternative mode of transport. There isn't anywhere to park as it's mainly residents' parking.  There is a bus stop about 250 yards away (only two different bus routes). Some on street parking nearby. Accessible buses pass nearby along the Shore.
the granary edinburgh,positive,"There is an accesible loo on the ground floor. With a wide entrance door and space to get in easily. Lots of buses stop nearby Is usually parking available in the street. Large, easy to access and clean! Great! Disabled toilet easy to access, perfectly clean and presentable An accessible loo is available on the ground floor."
the granary glasgow,negative,Being in Shawlands parking is quite limited. Because it's on the apex of Kilmarnock and Pollockshaws road the bus service is brilliant. Easy to get to from a lot of places in the South side.
the granary glasgow,positive,"The accessible toilet is quite large so plenty of room to move around . It has one of my pet hates, the toilet flush on the far side out of reach for some. The lock on the toilet door is also quite high."
the grand brighton,negative,We arrived by taxi which was fine. 
the grand brighton,positive,We were able to park in front of the hotel using our blue badge Accessible and plenty of space We telephoned ahead to check about parking. The concierge were great they advised use we could outside on a yellow line & use my blue badge. We also had the option of having our car parked in the car park.  The staff were extremely helpful. We chose to park in the car park & even had an offer of one of there wheelchairs. Toilets were on the ground floor with wide access and a separate toilet was available for disabled users. This had plenty of room & hand rails available. We had an accessible room  which had an adapted toilet which was good. 
the grand hotel blackpool,positive,Bus stop outside the hotel and Tram stop approx 500 yards up the promenade.  On site parking £7 Per Night
the grand hotel eastbourne,positive,"The hotel is on the seafront in Eastbourne, close to a bus stop.  There are 2 disabled parking spaces and any of the spaces in the car park can be reserved free of charge if you hold a blue badge"
the grand social dublin,positive,"Bathroom is good but you need a code to get in and can't lock it from the inside, the staff have often come in and opened the door on me without knocking."
the grantley arms wonersh,negative,"The bus comes through Wonersh but doesn't stop right outside.  There's a car park to the side and no apparent direct way in from it so you have to walk round the front.  The path is uneven and includes a cobblestone section.  There are no disabled bays in the car park. It's great that there is an accessible loo. However there's only one small grab rail - I had to use the wash basin to hold onto as well!  There's no alarm cord.  I reckon there would just have been enough space to turn a wheelchair round, but transfer would have been tricky with such a small, singular rail."
the grassmarket edinburgh,positive,On street parking and plenty of space to park with a Blue Badge An automated toilet (accessible) is situated in the Grassmarket. Access is via a RADAR key or 30p payment.
the great wall shetland,positive,There is a large car park which is all  tarmac then you go onto a paved area to go into the restaurant. It is all level & easily accessed.  The toilet is accessible although you have to go through a passage which is quite tight with a few objects in it. There are grab rails but no emergency cord. It was clean & tidy. 
the green frog moffat,negative,Off the main road.  Parking was fine. Went by car
the green frog moffat,positive,One disability toilets see photo  Ample parking outside main door. Well equipped single room. Appropriate rails and space around toilet Very easy. Close to the main entrance 
the green hotel kinross,positive,"We drove down from Pitlochry and there are 2 parking bays for the disabled outside the front door. If you are travelling by bus, the bus stop from the north is just across the road and from the south, it is outside the bank next door. The accessible loo was fine and easy to find.  There were plenty of grab rails and there was space for a carer, but not enough to turn my wheelchair round to go out forwards.  I had to reverse out."
the green lunch box paisley,negative,"Limited parking outside on street, but on Newton st (behind Maxwellton park) there is usually plenty of space and a 2 minute walk away. No disabled toilet facilties, but toilet is fresh and clean, door is wide enough to be accessible by wheelchair but no handrails for support, room for one rollator to be parked but again space is limited"
the green room london,positive,"Between Waterloo and Southwark underground stations, both step free access from the Jubilee Line. Don't know about parking, but is part of the National Theatre who are normally quite good at arranging it. The loo is to the left of the entrance. Spacious, but with a bit of clutter from baby change stuff around the toilet itself. Red cord was tied up, and soap dispenser was a bit high."
the green welly stop tyndrum,negative,There are 5 disabled parking spaces near the entrance. Two of these had no additional space at the sides and there wasn’t much room. The car park is quite stony and there is gravel which made it quite difficult to self propel my wheelchair.  There is one accessible toilet at the back of the venue (reached by using a wheelchair lift up some stairs). There was quite a lot of space and it was clean. 
the green welly stop tyndrum,positive,"Good sized toilet with a changing table. Was nice to see a Red Cord Card attached to the emergency cord. Note that there are steps to the toilets if you are coming from the main entrance of cafe. There is a platform lift beside the steps, but if you'd prefer not to use this there is also a level entrance doorway to the toilets from the coach parking spaces outside. This depends on where you choose to park/drop off of course. My only criticism is the placement of large bins beside the toilet space. "
the greenstone dereham,positive,"Lots of parking. Blue Badge spaces right outside pub door. It was very clean, lots of space. Suitable grab bars , alarm pull. No places to change adults except the floor. "
the greenway hotel spa cheltenham,negative,"Spotlessly clean, nicely decorated, but very small, my husband had to leave chair outside in passageway. There is no accessible toilet, just small ladies or gents, and I found I needed to get up from my chair to make use of their very clean, nicely decorated toilet facilities."
the greenway hotel spa cheltenham,positive,"A wonderful drive to get you to the hotel, and the car park is large enough with two disabled bays close to the front entrance. Plenty of parking for the Spa itself, with its own car parking area, allowing easy access into the Spa itself."
the greyhound chippenham,negative,If you have some mobilitye.g. You use crutches you will be abke to access the Gents and Ladies toilets. There is no disabled toilet. 
the greyhound chippenham,positive,There is a large public (free) carcar park opposite the pub. There is some space outside on the road too. 
the grill at dakota hotel eurocentral holytown,positive,"A number of disabled bays immediately outside entrance of the hotel. Toilet was perfectly accessible for me. However, the door is a folding door that may prove difficult for anyone with an upper body impairment."
the grove bournemouth,positive,Fully accessible  with a lift. Good size car park. Accessible and very smart loos.
the grumpy goat glasgow,positive,"now that Yorkhill has moved, it is considerably easier to park in this area and the restaurant is right on the street"
the guild of foresters edinburgh,negative,"Street parking only I think but drop-off is always possible and parking nearby is likely.    Also, the excellent Lothian bus service passes the door"
the guild of foresters edinburgh,positive,"Excellent toilet, and when I pointed out to a member of staff that the emergency red pull cord had been neatly arranged to keep it well clear of the floor (and the floor is where you might be in the case of a fall! )  I was taken seriously and I am sure that this will have been remedied at the time of writing We drove and parked at in the nearby Tumbles car park as we were going to be wandering along the promenade, but there is on-street parking closer to the pub. There is also a bus stop just outside. Very, very clean, and a nice big size - just not huge. Decent sized accessible loo located next to the bar. Didn't need to use it on this visit."
the guildhall linen exchange dunfermline,negative,Not too far from the bus station however the closest parking intended for blue badge holders is normally always full and it is not very close to the car parks.
the guildhall linen exchange dunfermline,positive,"The RADAR toilet is always very clean, there is a pull alarm and bars around the toilet that can be moved up. This toilet is also used as a changing area and staff toilet however. Free parking on street before 12 noon and after 3. Superb and my greatest bugbear is emergency cord cut short or tied up. This venue always meets spec."
the gulistan house dundee,negative,"There is an accessible toilet right as you come in the back entrance of the restaurant so it is quite easy to find and is beside the other toilets. It is very small though and wheelchair may struggle to get in, especially if someone needed assistance. Wheelchair users would definitely struggle to turn to get into the sink as on the other wall adjacent to the sink is the baby change.   If someone had to transfer from the right-hand side of the toilet then this would not be possible as the toilet is right up against the wall. However, also when I visited there was a mop and bucket at the other side of the toilet that would get in the way.  To me the toilet wasn't very clean and the emergency red cord was too far away from the toilet."
the gulistan house dundee,positive,"There is usually a council car park right across the road from this restaurant however, when I visited there was construction going on so there weren't many parking spaces available. I'm not sure if this is permanent or not.  With the restaurant being in Broughty Ferry though and over the bridge from the main high street, there is plenty of on street parking and another council car park roughly a 10 minute walk away.  There are lots of bus stops on the road where this restaurant is and buses pass through Broughty Ferry on a regular basis. The train station is also right across the road, although I don't know how often they stop but I know it's not that much. There is also a taxi rank roughly a 10 minute walk away. "
the hair boutique by rachel helen cranleigh,negative,"The loo is located at the very rear so potentially a bit of a trek for some. Whilst not specially adapted, the owner has installed a rail to be helpful and is considering further improvements.  The loo is very spacious  there's no alarm cord but staff are close at hand.   No signage at present but staff can direct."
the hair boutique by rachel helen cranleigh,positive,There is a blue badge bay about five yards from the door and space to park directly outside the salon on double yellow lines.   The nearest car park is about ten minutes walk/push away so on street parking is the best bet.  There's a bus stop almost opposite in the High Street.
the half moon london,positive,"Herne Hill Station is fully step-free. Speak to staff before you travel as they will have to deploy manual boarding ramps. The station is not always fully staffed after 6pm, which is disappointing and strange as it can mean that wheelchair users are not able to use the station after 6pm.  Many bus routes serve the area.  The accessible toilet is very good but there were two serious flaws:  1) The red emergency had been twisted in a complex way round a grabrail. This is silly and dangerous. This red cord must hang freely all the way to the floor all the time, so that it can be reached by anyone who falls over and needs to call for assistance. It is *not* too long, it does not need to be tidied away or tucked away or twisted around any grabrail. It is the length it is for a good reason. See my photos below.  2) There was a huge bin, along with eight or so folded yellow plastic 'wet floor' signs, just to the left of the doorway. These objects make it very difficult to turn a wheelchair in the toilet. The reason accessible toilets are so spacious is precisely because wheelchairs need a lot of room for manoeuvre. As things are currently laid out in this toilet, it is too difficult for a wheelchair user to turn around and park next to the toilet in the wheelchair transfer area. This means that in practice, it is impossible for most wheelchair users to use the toilet at all. The large bin and the wet floor sign need to be moved away, and a smaller bin installed elsewhere in the cubicle (though *not* in the wheelchair transfer area of course)."
the harbour paphos,negative,There was a car park nearby
the harbour paphos,positive,"There was a fuly accessible toilet, accessed by a low gradient ramp"
the hare chelmsford,negative,"There is plenty of parking ,but only one disabled space. There is also a charging point for electric cars."
the hare chelmsford,positive,Excellent access to the spacious disabled toilet
the hare old redding,positive,"Car park with disabled spaces, popular at weekends.  Staff will advise if car park full.   Didn't use public transport.  Clean accessible  toilet with grab rails and alarm cord near  kitchen. Roomy.    Plenty of room to the accessible toilet and inside. Clean and tidy with standard additional handles."
the harrow inn wanborough,negative,"This is a difficult one to rate.  Although there is no accessible toilet in the pub itself, if a wheelchair user isn't booked into their accessible room, the staff are happy for you to use the toilet in that room, which is completely accessible.   The room is about six metres from the pub entrance."
the harrow inn wanborough,positive,"Massive carpark which, although doesn't have a marked disabled space, is never full, even on the very busy May day and so there is plenty of room for parking leaving space for access.  The carpark is a little rough in places, but not enough to cause any problems."
the harry potter shop london,positive,"This is within a major London train station, so couldn't really be closer to public transport. Underground, buses and taxis are all also nearby - though you would have to find what was best for your individual needs. As in central London, driving and parking could be difficult. The shop is incorporated into the railway station at Kings Cross. There is an accessible loo and Changing Places Toilet adjacent to the shop on the station concourse."
the harte and garter hotel and spa windsor,negative,"There is no car park for the hotel which might be tricky, but there is an unloading zone outside the entrance and there was no issue with having to rush.  If coming from the station then the hotel is really convenient being about 20m round the corner."
the harte and garter hotel and spa windsor,positive,"Excellent, no complaints"
the hawthorns west bromwich,positive,"The disabled parking is near to the ground, it's a bit of a jaunt back at the end of the games, but 9 times out of 10 you can safely get through. I'd advise you take a loud bell or in the winter months a torch, that way you're seen if you are in a wheelchair /scooter /or power chair.  The toilets are accessible, but at times especially after the game, rather wet floors"
the hayes conference centre hayes lane swanwick,positive,easy by car lots of disabled toilets around the hotel
the heath pub cardiff,negative,I didn't need to use the disabled toilet but it was at the end of a short corridor which had to be accessed via a heavy door which opened outwards. Not ideal.
the hedley verity leeds,negative,"There is very limited car parking nearby,  but it is very close to several bus stops, and is maybe a mile from the train station. The side street for wheelchair access is cobbled and uneven."
the hedley verity leeds,positive,There is a disabled toilet with enough room to be used by a powerchair user however it could be a tight fit for others
the helix grangemouth,negative,"Not enough parking.  Inappropriate surfaces.  Too far from children's play area, lake, Kelpies. Lots of car parking but not enough disabled spaces.  Accessible loo at the lagoon and the visitor centre. Downside to the toilet at the lagoon is that there is only one accessible loo and that seems to double up as baby changing. As it's the closest loo to the children's play area at busy times you can have to queue for a long time behind the babies. With a facility this new why didn't they have separate baby change?"
the helix grangemouth,positive,"I drove and there were 4 disabled parking spaces close to the start of the path. There was gravel to cross hencce why only 4 stars. It's great to see a park with so many facilities without disrupting the nature or green space. I came across three public toilet buildings while walking through the Helix, and they all had accessible toilets. I even spotted a Euan's Guide Red Cord Card in one!"
the hen and chicken bristol,negative,On street parking outside. Accessible toilet in downstairs pub.
the hen and chicken bristol,positive,Street parking available
the henglers circus glasgow,positive,Usual city parking. You just need to get lucky on the streets. Being on my mobility scooter that lives in the car I was able to scoot quite a long way.  Clean accessible toilet with Radar key entry or key at the bar. It had all the necessary rails and the red cord was fine but problems created by combining it with baby change. Nappy bin by the toilet would make side transfer difficult. Would be a bit of a squeeze to also fit a carer. Unless they are petite!
the hepworth wakefield wakefield,positive,"We travelled to the gallery on the free Wakefield bus that is wheelchair accessible. There is a bus stop very close to the gallery.  No problems.  They have changing place toilets and normal accessible toilets the rest cord was hanging freely in the disabled toilet Plentiful blue badge parking next to the entrance Well signposted, large room with lots of room to manouevre.  Plenty of grab rails outside the gallery for cars and around Wakefield there is a free accessible bus that goes to both train stations and bus station. The new wakefield Westgate station is fully accessible but the Kirkgate station is being modernised. wide door but a sharp turn to enter. large room."
the herringbone north berwick,negative,There is off street parking but it is busy in this area there is also a good bus service and train station in North Berwick Restaurant is on the main street and parking is hit or miss. We were unlucky and did a circuit of the town before we found a space about 200m from the venue. The pavement is quite narrow and a challenge on a bank holiday with all the tourists. But don't let this deter you as the meal experience is worth the effort.  No wheelchair accessible toilet but the staff said I could use one and the carer could keep the door of the other one opposite open to provide privacy. I have a leg bag and we just checked for the purpose of this review (too much information!)
the hideaway cafe bridge of allan,negative,Transport links are not great here. The cafe does not have its own car parking spaces. There is on street parking in Bridge of Allan but it is for 30 minutes max. There are a few car parks in the village. There are bus stops near by. The cafe is about 10-15 minute walk away from the train station. 
the high dive edinburgh,negative,There is two bus stops not far away. Less than 10 minutes away I m a wobbly walker 
the high dive edinburgh,positive,There is photographs 
the high field town house birmingham,positive,"Parking in the private carpark can be limited so its on a first come first served basis.  But having said that we had no problem parking. Receptionist will call a taxi (the hotel is 2.4 miles from the city centre) Seemed plenty of space (no clutter), grab rails (stylishly fits in with the decor), emergency cord."
the high line new york,positive,Not sure about parking - but the High Line is easy to access from a multitude of locations. Many of the New York Subway stations are wheelchair accessible - including 14th St 8th Ave which is just a couple of blocks away from the Gansevoort elevator. Standard US accessible loo set up. Located within the main restrooms. Pictured is the one just near the Gansevoort St access point. Large with everything you would need. Also nice and clean
the historic dockyard chatham,negative,"The accessible toilet near the children's play area is completely inadequate: the red emergency cord is much too short, it stops at waist level and should reach all the way to the ground; there is no soap, and nothing to dry your hands with.   The accessible toilet near the main café is excellent, with everything correctly configured - except that there was a rubbish bin in the wheelchair transfer area, which is very silly and thoughless."
the historic dockyard chatham,positive,"I don't drive so I don't know about parking. The Dockyards are about a mile from Chatham Station, and there are bus routes running between the two locations, I noticed that the buses have wheelchair ramps but I didn't use buses so I can't comment on their accessibility. Chatham Station is fully wheelchair accessible, has exceptionally friendly and helpful staff, and ramps. To get to the platforms, cross the road in front of the main station building forecourt and follow the signs pointing to slopes and ramps which run to to either platform 1 or platform 2. We arrived by motorhome and parked in a large bay on the left as you drive into the docks area (before the main car park). There is loads of parking and even on a bank holiday, it was nowhere near capacity. There are paths to walk around to the entrance. On this occasion, I didn't specifically look for accessible parking but I think they are right outside the entrance. Toilets all over the site and a good number of accessible ones. All clean, well sized and equipped. "
the hitching post dumfries,positive,It was a U shaped toilet. A fair bit of space and enough grab handles for me.  It was very clean. 
the hive worcester,negative,"bit of a hike/wheel, near bus station and train station"
the hive worcester,positive,ok so long as lazy able bodied users hog it
the hogs head inn alnwick,negative,"Accessible toilet had grab rails, low basin and mirror, two red cords. All good till you come to the shower. Accessed by climbing into the low bath. Adjustable shower on the wall was far too high to reach safely.  We had to pull the red cord for help when my husband slipped off the toilet on to the floor. No response to the red cord for 1 1/4 hours in the early hours. Very apologetic staff had difficulty resetting the alarm and had to climb into the bath to reach it. Really needs to be a wetroom and abandon the bath. The floor tiles were quite slippy even when dry which was what made it impossible for my husband to get up when he fell. "
the hogs head inn alnwick,positive,"The hotel is located right beside the A1 and about 5 minutes from the centre of Alnwick. Loads of space to park. Flat and easy access to the hotel. There are more parking spaces here than they could ever use and quite a few are marked disabled, though perhaps a little subtly. A lot were used by non-blue badge vehicles but there are so many it really isn't an issue. Very new and built to the latest standards. Could find no fault."
the hollies appleby in westmorland,negative,Parking space right outside the front door.  You really need a car to get about.
the hollies appleby in westmorland,positive,"Parking at front is good with a paved area for wheelchairs and path to rear of property Fully adapted wet room Parking was availble on site next to the cottage.  The access was perfect , well laid out wet room well equipped with shower chair and rails. There is a small step at the front door but there is a hand rail and there is easy access through the back door. The parking at the front of the lodge is spacious and its possible to park close to the front door My parents are both elderly and have mobility needs. The Lodge has been very thoughtfully designed with wheelchair users and those with mobility needs in mind. there is a downstairs bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom has low level fittings and plenty of hand rails and is a wet room. The kitchen has low level adjustableunits and the doorways downstairs are wide enough to accomodate a wheelchair. Parking at the lodge was excellent with no threshold to manoeuvre when using the back door. We used our own car during this visit. In general we found parking ok around the Lakes and Dales. Some of the pavements were difficult to negotiate mainly due to lack of ramps and vehicles parked on the pavements. However, this can be said for most places. One trip we would recommend for powered wheelchair/scooter users was Grisdale where there was a lovely path going around a lake. As previously stated the wet room and loo is excellent. Plenty of parking. We reversed the car onto a paved area at the side of the lodge and lowered the ramp on to that. It's a dedicated space. Public transport I don't know, but there is a station close by. Transfer from the right but plenty of room to position the chair close in. A solid grab rail on the wall to the left of the loo but I didn't find it necessary to use it. Comfortable too, for a change. Plenty of room to have a carer present."
the holly bush alcester,negative,It doesn't have its own parking. We were lucky and got the last space outside on the street. However there is plenty of parking in the town's car parks which are only 5 minutes away.
the holly bush alcester,positive,Easy to find and get to. Toilet was very large with lots of grab handles and would accommodate a wheelchair and a carer at the same time if so required. It was clean and tidy and everything worked when I visited .
the honest lawyer hotel durham,positive,"There were two disabled parking spots outside rooms one and two. However one spot was on a slope so very difficult for me to walk on or get out of the car. The second spot, if occupied, meant you couldn't wheel to the bottom of the access ramp - instead we had to divert til we found a big enough gap to fit the wheelchair through. Not a great inconvenience but would have been a nuisance for someone walking with a walking aid. Lovely accessible loo in main bar.  Centrally located. Sign on door. Well equipped, roomy and clean. Loo in room could have done with lower grab rails (shoulder height when sitting - would have been better slightly lower).  There were no rails by the basin. The shower had just one horizontal  bar so getting in and out was tricky.  The floor was tiled in the loo (non slip flooring in shower alone) which gathered condensation after shower was run, becoming very slippery. There were two moveable shower seats/stool, it was good to have the extra one to hold onto."
the honey pot keswick,negative,Not very big so struggled to close the door once I'd got my electric wheelchair in. Cord about 1 metre too short. 
the honey pot keswick,positive,It's in the centre of the town so car parks not too far away.
the horsebox cafe and gift shop grangemouth,positive,"There are toilets right outside this cafe and shop in an attached building. I didn't use them however, so cannot comment (but other accessible toilets within the park as a whole were great)."
the household cavalry museum london,positive,"Access to the loo is up a small ramp and has a slightly tight corner to negotiate. The door is opened automatically pressing a button. Once inside, there is a good amount of space. We had been at Westminster that morning so had come across after that - that's a wheelchair accessible station on the Jubilee Line. Not sure what the Blue Badge parking provisions nearby are.. I didn't use them but my pal did - said that they were absolutely spotless. There is a ramp to access the accessible loo from the shop."
the hub aberdeen,positive,Can't comment on parking. Bus no. 20 from the city centre gets you quite close (5 minute wheel/walk) - see review of St Machar's Cathedral for more detail. Located in the entrance hall on the right after you enter the building & well signed. Easy to access & spacious. Well equipped with grab rails. Side transfer possible from both sides. Only minus points were (1) alarm cord too short so not reaching floor level. (2) loo roll located so that only a loo user with arms of simian length could reach it.
the hub edinburgh,negative,Parking isn’t great for the hub but there are a couple of accessible spaces at the top of Johnston Terrace. Slightly hindered by the absence of a dropped kerb to the pavement in front of the Hub. The gateway to the Hub could do with some remedial works to iron out the rough and lumpy concrete forming the threshold.
the hub edinburgh,positive,Parking is not brilliant being at the top end of the Royal Mile ( a fairly steep hill). There is an accessible toilet with all the features you would expect to find. There are two disabled bays across the road from the hub. you can park in the car park at the castle the toilets are accessible too There are a couple of good accessible loos. On diff end floors which was handy. Doubles as baby change. Red cord was tied up when visited. Yes all perfect .
the hub ice cream parlour coffee shop johnstone,negative,Large toilet. Wheelchair accessible but no handrails
the hub ice cream parlour coffee shop johnstone,positive,Drove in car - large carpark at rear. Short walk from bus stop
the huxley edinburgh,negative,We came by bus. The restaurant is on the corner of Lothian Road and Princes St so there are many bus options and also a tram stop a few minutes walk away. I am unsure about parking. The toilet is a decent size. No Changing Places nearby that I can note. The toilet is not locked so no need to ask staff for a RADAR key. The red cord was not hanging to the floor however.
the hytte hexham,positive,There is a large parking area which will accommodate adapted vehicles. Own transport is needed as it is set in country lane off the A68. Grab rails in position There is ample parking right outside The Hytte and room for turning vehicles also. We did not use public transport as we had our own minibus so unable to comment.  There is lots to see and do in Northumberland but you will need transport or access to transport as The Hytte is set in a small village lane. Ample space in the bathroom for turning / manoeuvring a wheelchair or other aid. Spotlessly clean and tidy and clutter free.  Plenty of space for Carers to support.  Grab rails in situ. I don’t think it’s on a bus route so I would say a car is essential and there’s ample parking space just outside for numerous cars. The wetroom is fully kitted out and plenty of space to manoeuvre my electric wheelchair.There is a another bathroom which can be used also.
the imperial hereford hereford,negative,No disabled parking on site Only just big enough. Difficult to transfer from chair to toilet and back again.
the imperial palace edinburgh,negative,Only drop off zone facilities available outside the restaurant but plenty of public transport can be used.
the imperial palace edinburgh,positive,"Despite being behind a heavy door which you will need assistance with, these are superb - accessible, large and clean."
the imperial the imperial,negative,I  didn't drive I walked I didn't use them but I hear there big
the inveralmond brewery perth,positive,"There is a disabled parking bay on site next to the front door. Additional parking on site and at the roadside outside the building. The clearly signed toilet is near the front door, in the corridor between the bar and production area. It is clean and tidy with space for a wheelchair and carer. It has grab rails and an alarm."
the irish whisky museum dublin,positive,"Right opposite Trinity College, lots of buses stopping nearby and a short-ish walk from Luas trams. Very good and clean."
the ironworks inverness,negative,"Parking is very limited at venue car park which requires a permit available from ticket office, there is Rose street multi-storey car park about 400 mtrs away and on street parking close by. "
the ironworks inverness,positive,"Accessible toilet on ground floor is very clean and spacious plenty room to move around and for a carer, situated by the little bird cafe  I was dropped off next to the venue where there is a drop off/ pick up area but there is a small car park next to it with dedicated disabled parking spaces"
the isthmus tarbert,negative,There is plenty of parking but it is limited next to the restaurant - they have one designated disabled spot.  There is room next to the entrance to disembark and then park if necessary.
the ivy buchanan street glasgow,positive,The toilet was spacious and very clean. 
the ivy on the square edinburgh,negative,Parking was not easy partly due to roadworks which made the nearby disabled parking bays impossible to use. Instead I and others where dropped off outside the restaurant while my dad the driver hunted for a space. Luckily due to the fact that I have a disabled blue parking badge he manage to park a short distance away on George Street.  There are plenty of bus stops in close proximity is to the restaurant and Waverley train station is close. Another option is of course the Edinburgh tram which is also very close. 
the ivy on the square edinburgh,positive,"Being in the centre, with work going on around St Andrews square, dedicated disabled spaces are not in use at the moment.  Handy for buses and trains which are 2 minutes away on princes street. The loo was very nice, clean, spacious with grab rails, full length cord, and a large mirror on the door. ample room to turn around.  NO baby change, which is a welcome change leaving the space for better access. Drove, parked each time using blue badge on George Street. There is a disabled toilet on the ground floor beside the stairs. The disabled toilet has a emergency red cord. See photo"
the jam jar rothesay,positive,Plenty of level parking space Very easy to find with plenty of space. Grab rails beside the toilet and towel dispenser was lower.  Space beside the toilet for a carer.
the james watt greenock,positive,There is lots of pay and display parking nearby although with over 6 disabled parking bays nearby.  See picture below but the disc zones can be misleading. In order to park in those Disc zones you do need to display disc to park there for 2 hours.    The pub also has its own car park which customers can use for free although it is slightly hidden and does involve a tiny hill.   There are cobbled streets as well in and around the Jimmy Watt.   The Greenock central train station is five minute walk away.  They do have toilets for those with impairments didn't actually go in to see it sorry. 
the jazz cafe london,negative,"There is an accessible bathroom but there are many problems: 1. The door which the public use is controlled by a radar key handle which is at the right level. But there is also much higher up lock which must be turned. 2. There are two doors into the disabled toilet - one lead into the public area and the other leading directly into the dressing room for the acts. The store has a small lock which must be turned otherwise people will come into the toilet and invited! Even if the door is locked, the handle will go and you will do a very nervous wee! 3. There is only one drop down rail on one side the toilet, the other side is completely open and too far away from the wall for you to use it as a support. 4. The disabled toilet is used as a changing area for the act and so you may have to wait a long time until you can get in."
the job bulman newcastle upon tyne,negative,"I did not actually drive there but I know that there is a car park around the back of the pub which has disabled parking spaces. For someone with a wheelchair, the parking may become a problem."
the job bulman newcastle upon tyne,positive,There is an accessible toilet that has to be accessed with a key from behind the bar. It is checked hourly which means that it is always clean and tidy. It has grab rails and an alarm cord which makes it a very good and acceptable accessible toilet.
the john bunyan st albans,positive,"Good parking, but the lane leading to the pub is single track with passing places"
the john millington cheadle hulme,positive,Large car park and a number of dedicated disabled spaces. On major bus route and within walking distance of train station.  Clean and tidy. Radar key needed. 
the jolly botanist edinburgh,positive,"There are many bus stops nearby both on Dalry road, Morrison St & West Maitland St. There is limited parking on Morrison Street but plenty in the Dalry road area and other neighbouring streets.  The loo is to the right of the bar as you enter. It is a good size for bigger wheel/power chairs and has an emergency cord.  We had walked there so not 100% sure about parking, but imagine you could park somewhere on Dalry Road and head round. Also plenty of buses drop off nearby and Haymarket train station is very close by. Very nice and clean disabled toilet facilities."
the jolly good fish cafe teignmouth,positive,"The café is in Teignmouth town centre, which is a five minute level walk from the train station. Teignmouth train station has step free access available. There are also a number of local buses that stop near by."
the jugged hare london,negative,"It's city centre london, the bus stop was quite a bit away."
the kelpies falkirk,negative,"Apologises, I can not rate the toilets because they were closed to the public due to the COVID - 19. We drove to the nearest Tesco supermarket to use their toilets. The toilet was very small there was not enough room for myself and support worker. "
the kelpies falkirk,positive,"Parking is easy this is either at the main car park or by the visitor centre.  There is also parking near the play park area. There was a lot of disabled parking There were plenty of loos. Car park is all well paved and wheelchair use no problem. This car pack gets particularly busy on the weekend. A separate area (even closer to the visitor centre) was being used as ""overflow"" disable parking when we visited. The visitor centre is working out of a temporary building just now. A purpose built building is due next year (I think) There is a single (huge) accessible toilet at the visitor centre. There is a good ramp up to the entrance of the building but there is a very low ledge you need to negotiate to get in. The loo also accommodates a very big baby changing area and an accessible shower! At Helix park home of the Kelpies, there are two car parks with a lot of disabled parking spaces. Queensferry you can park in the street if you have a blue badge.  There was plenty of disabled parking.  There were a lot of disabled loos and they were clean. Parking was good if you come by car as you have a selection of car parking points. You can also get up close to the visitor centre if you head for the barrier at the access  road and make yourself known. If you arrive on the water in one of the fabulous boards you couldn't get any closer with a selection of mooring points. Public transport may be a little more challenging although there did appear to be a bus stop but we didn't see any buses. The visitor centre had an accessible loo. Large, bright and clean and tidy. Is a wee distance from the venue (200 yards maybe).  A tight space for a wheelchair ♿ user  As mentioned there is disabled parking but they could do with more spaces for such a popular venue so you may struggle to get a space. Excellent facility Ca park attendants tell you where there is. A disabled space and its free Regardless of the lack of public transport, getting there is quite straightforward. The park was really busy when we got there about 3pm on a Thursday afternoon in August.  My friend has a blue badge and the person at the car park entrance mentioned we could park at the visitor centre, very close to the sculptures. We just had to give a £3 deposit, get a card and then give it back on return. The was about 8 accessible bays.  Another option of getting there is to walk about 45mins from Falkirk along the canal. Good accessible loo in the visitor centre. Lots of parking and free for disabled. We arrived by car on a surprisingly busy Wednesday during holidays. The overflow parking on the way in was full; with cones to discourage drivers continuing to the main car park.   The overflow parking appeared (and is) some distance from the Kelpies, so we took a chance and drove round the cones. The main car park was also full with an attendant operating a 1 in 1 out system.   After a 20min wait we were sent round to the empty coach parking to give us more space for the wheelchair. They also waived the £2 charge (think overflow was free to all). Shame we had to wait but no biggie really. I didn't need to use any toilet facilities so can't comment. However, the toilets at the car park were all in Portacabins. All the toilets I did see had several steps up to them. I didn't seek out a specific disabled toilet. It is so great to see the baby changing facilities separate from the accessible toilet! The toilet was large and clean, and I even spotted a Euan's Guide Red Cord Card!"
the kilted donut edinburgh,positive,"Not much parking around, although you could parking off the street, but the shop is on a busy main road and right next to popular bus routes going to Ocean Terminal. "
the kilted kangaroo stirling,positive,"There are some parking spaces right outside the bar which are accessed through the alleyway. Stirling train and bus stations are both about a 10-15 minutes from the venue as well.  There is a spacious accessible loo, however, there was no red cord.  When I visited I took my car but didn’t know if Kilted Kangaroo had a car park and I wasn’t very familiar with where any parking spaces were. We drove around and found onstreet disabled parking spaces down a side street so decided to park there. As we walked towards the restaurant I noticed there was a walkway across the road leading towards a car par but, couldn’t see where the entrance was for cars. You walk down an ally way to get to the restaurant and as we did I noticed there were cars outside the entrance. I don’t know how they got into the area and there didn’t look like there was a lot of turning space.  I am not from Stirling so I can’t comment too much on the public transport however, I did see buses drive up the high street road where the restaurant is located so I’m guessing there are bus stops nearby. The train station and bus station is roughly a 15-minute walk away. It’s quite a narrow and busy high street so I can image it could be a little difficult for a taxi driver to park right outside. A small car park, close to the bus and train station. There is no red cord but the toilet is spacious and has the appropriate grab rails."
the kinema in the woods woodhall spa,positive,"Loo isn’t huge, so don’t expect a big Changing Places one, but I got in easily in a manual wheelchair and the transfer was left to right. Space to turn chair to lock door ( which is a sliding door with an easy catch. I locked it. I often don’t as I have fear of getting stuck!) There are two disabled toilets in the building, both next to each other located next to the ladies toilets. Theses cubicles are very spacious and provide a horizontal, vertical and a folding grab rail on either side of the toilet. The sink isn’t too high making it easy access for disabled customers to reach. Both doors are sliding doors with a lock that you can engage by twisting the door handle."
the king and castle windsor,negative,I couldn't get to it!
the kings arms london,negative,Lots of bus routes along Oxford St will drop you a few yards from the pub. No step-free train or tube stations nearby.
the kings fund london,positive,"The King's Fund is tucked away down a side street off Cavendish Square, which is the square directly behind John Lewis on Oxford Street. The nearest tube is Oxford Circus, which is not step free and is often very busy. However, a number of buses stop very close by. The accessible toilet is on the ground floor and close to the library where the group met. There were grab rails and an emergency cord. It was spacious and very clean. It was also rather posh with individual hand towels, which you usually see in luxury hotels. "
the kings head inn newton under roseberry,positive,Some disabled only parking spaces Good access although didn't use the facilites
the kitchin edinburgh,positive,"There is lots of parking available in the area with the Scottish exec parking available for free at night. Large disabled toilets with grab rails. Parking quite near to the restuarant and as mentioned there are a bit of cobbles to get to the actual entrance. Lots of parking at Commercial Quay. Not sure if there are dedicated Blue Badge spaces. Buses to Commercial St, but then you'd have to walk round to the front entrance. Plenty of room for taxi drop-off, but then cobbles to negotiate Loos beside the bar through a (reasonably heavy) door - ladies', gents, separate accessible cubicle with plenty of room inside. Spotless. Lovely soap.  Staff leap in to action to open the door when they see you approaching!"
the klub dundee,positive,"There are 3 parking spaces outside of the gym, they aren't disabled parking spaces but if you exit from the back of your vehicle it would be okay. The owner said to me if my beautician mentions to her that I am coming she will put a cone out so there is a space available for me.  I'm not from this area so I don't know much about the public transport but the beauticians is located on the main street of Invergowrie so I think there will be bus stops nearby."
the ladybird boat trust wyton,positive,"The bathroom is wheelchair accessible and has plenty of space for a carer as well, but there is no hoist or changing bed."
the langley tap chippenham,positive,"Small car park with a disabled bay with was free for us on a busy Friday night. In the middle of nowhere so not sure about public transport. (See pictures attached) Little ramp and a door to get into where the loos are, I needed help holding the door as it’s hard to open while going up the slope in a manual chair. Disabled loo is unlocked (no radar key needed) and the door is very light. Nicely tiled disabled toilet / baby changing room. Not huge but a decent size. Just a basic disabled loo so no adult changing. Plenty of rails and a full length mirror on the door. Red emergency cord hangs all the way to the ground but with the lock (see pics) not sure if someone would be able to get in from the outside in an emergency, though there might be a way - I didn’t ask."
the lantern room edinburgh,positive,Good bus links on London Road and Elm Row. Near Edinburgh Waverley station and the York Place tram stop.
the lass o richmond hill richmond,positive,"Accessable loo, large enough for a wheelchair.  Clean and with grab rails.  Key for toilet kept in a special place, but staff show you where when one arrives.  Very helpful staff."
the last post paisley,positive,right at the train station at paisley buses are easy to get to this place this is a good size with the pull cord only one problem is the cord is often tucked behind the bin in the toilet
the leadmill sheffield,negative,"Blue badge holders can park on the street outside the venue. Please note that the pavement is very uneven. Bus stop: within 5 mins Tram stop: 10-15 mins (access through railway station) Train: 5-10 mins Unfortunately, the disabled toilet is very inconveniently located for live shows. It is at the opposite side of the venue to the viewing platform, and it can be tricky getting to it when there is a crowd. However, security staff are always available to clear a path. The toilet is a reasonable size and well maintained."
the lexicon bracknell,positive,"Plenty of disabled spaces near to lifts Decent sized accessible toilet, well signposted. Also have a huge changing places toilet with hoist and shower easily accessed with a Radar key."
the library at the bridge glasgow,positive,"This venue has a massive car park, the public transport is very good here at the venue  Their is a disabled toilet within the bottem of the libary and their is one within the cafe at the top,"
the library of birmingham birmingham,negative,Immediate area is under construction at the moment so not sure how parking would work. There are only a couple of disabled spots next to the library and they were both occupied.There is no public car ark.Transport is good by bus or train as it is near the city centre
the life academy edinburgh,negative,"The loo is on the same level as the therapy rooms, but there is a ledge to negotiate. No grab handles inside. Not enough space for a carer I don't think. The lock is quite high up."
the life academy edinburgh,positive,"You can park on the tarmac out the front of no. 3 and there are two spaces reserved for the Life Academy (3B), which I imagine you can use with prior notification. Buses to Morningside Road. Plenty of space on the tarmac for a taxi to turn."
the light leeds,positive,"There is parking in the light, with a number of disabled parking spaces A number of accessible toilets around the mall"
the lightbox woking,negative,"We are always saved a parking space, which is a major asset, as nearby car parks are often very busy.  The Lightbox car park is not very big.  Trains are within walking distance, but major roads to cross, but with audible signals."
the lightbox woking,positive,Unisex toilets on all levels.
the lighthouse glasgow,negative,I never used the accessible toilets so I am unable to review although going by everything else in this venue I would be surprised if they are not more than adequate. Parking and transport might be an issue for some people as the Ligthouse is set in a side street off Buchanan Street which in itself is pedestrianised.
the lighthouse glasgow,positive,"We walked so I'm uncertain about public transport, although The Lighthouse is down a lane just off of the pedestrianised part of Buchanan Street which made it easy to reach.  Well signposted and reached via wide, spacious corridors.  The accessible toilets are clearly signposted and provide easy access."
the lime tree cafe knaresborough,positive,"Plenty of parking at the venue Toilets easily accessible, clean and well maintained"
the limes country lodge hotel solihull,positive,"You arrive after driving through pleasant open countryside and enter the grounds across a compressed chippings carpark, plenty large enough, with spaces for disabled to park quite close to hotels entrance."
the liner liverpool,positive,There are two parking bays directly outside main entrance.  Double lines on road - can park using blue badge Disabled loos on ground floor.  clean
the linton hotel east linton,negative,This is covered in the introduction.
the linton hotel east linton,positive,Good size and well equipped.  You need to go in and reverse out.  Not quite enough room to turn round.
the lioness of leith edinburgh,negative,Difficult to get dropped off near this place but there is  a dropped curb directly opposite the entrance.
the little angel henley on thames,positive,Good parking.
the little bakery south queensferry,negative,"Parking isn’t so easy along this narrow, busy street, but there is some on street parking. We parked in the car park beside Scotmid just two minutes away, although this was up a fairly steep hill - however it did have lots of accessible parking spaces. "
the little bakery south queensferry,positive,"Big toilet, a little bit messy when I visited. Didn’t notice an emergency cord beside the toilet - sink and hand dryer were at a mid height which was good. This doubles up as a baby change space."
the little red train rethymno,positive,The train was great as it stopped at several stops on its journey with plenty of time to get off. It was hand for me to get to places that I wouldn't otherwise see or perhaps even find. I felt that it was good value for the seven euros that I paid. As with most places in the area there were plenty of bars and cafes where you could find a toilet. Some had accessible toilets as well. 
the lobster shack north berwick,negative,"Parking can be very tricky in North Berwick, particularly at weekends. But there are plenty of public parking spaces in town that are only a short stroll from the seafront."
the loch house lochwinnoch,positive,The Loch house is very accessible by car on the main route towards Glasgow. There is also a car park with disabled parking spaces available. The restaurant has an accessible toilet which is quite small with hand rails. The toilet is near an open set of stairs which lead downwards. Please be careful if you are visually impaired.
the loch katrine experience stirling,positive,"large car park (not busy on a weekday out of season) with couple of disabled spaces and readily accessible disabled toilet in car park. disabled toilet in car park accessible, with okay cleanliness but bit chilly on typical 'summer's' day in Scotland One can drive to thre Trossach Pier from anywhere in Scotland.  Theree is one disabled parking bay right beside the booking office with another three withing 50 yards Sorry, I did not use them, but did note an accessible loo onboard.    See https://www.lochkatrine.com/contact-find-us/accessibility/"
the lodge forest visitor centre stirling,positive,Free disabled parking spaces beside the entrance. There is also a large carpark with pay and display parking.  Excellent disabled toilet near the entrance There are around 5 accessible spaces near the visitor centre. There are lots of other parking options dotted around the pond. Usually there is a charge for parking but this was not the case when we visited. The toilets were operating on a one in one out policy when I visited. This meant that the block of toilets was gender neutral and the accessible toilet is found within the block. It was spacious with a good layout. 
the london peace pagoda london,negative,"There's very little accessible public transport in the vicinity. Bus routes 44, 137 and 452 will drop you off at the Chelsea Gate of the park. I don't know about parking."
the loose box bar kitchen london,negative,We were on foot- me in wheelchair. We had walked about 15 minutes from nearest step free tube station at Westminster.  I dare say there were buses passing nearby - this is just off the beaten track between Westminster and Victoria - easy to find in Horseferry Rd. Didn't see any Blue Badge spaces nearby though there may well have been.
the loose box bar kitchen london,positive,"Lovely loo, clean and well equipped. Only three criticisms : (1) it's got no signage on it so we had to ask if they had one and where it was ! (2) they have placed a table and seating so close to it, you can't manoeuvre a wheelchair in or out (3) the door is quite heavy/well-sprung so it's quite difficult to manage."
the lord darcy leeds,positive,Slightly small for my powerchair & PA to fit but we managed. The toilet was key locked so could only be used by people with a radar key & it was clean.
the lord lounsdale paisley,positive,"The pub has a large tarmac car park with several blue badge spaces. The car park is on a slight hill, but the disabled spaces are on the level. There is room to drop someone off if these spaces are occupied. The loss of half a star is only because the accessible toilet is at the opposite end of the pub from the eating area, so quite a long walk for some. It is opened with a key so would need a walk back to the bar to collect this if you didn't know. We opened it with our RADAR key.  The cubicle itself is roomy with plenty of space for a wheelchair and carer. There is a  drop down grab rail and one attached to the wall on the other side."
the lord rosebery scarborough,positive,Plenty of room for my blind mother-in-law to take a guide with her. I parked in a disabled bay within on street parking behind the venue. Very close to railway staion Easy to find and roomy enough to get my power chair turned around in. Clean and well kept
the lorne bar oban,negative,"Parking on street, but free if you display your blue badge. Parking is up against a wall, so little room to manoever from drivers side. Also means transferring in and out of car / wheelchair in the road Pub close to transport hubs, and town facilities. Good drop downs on pavement"
the lost gardens of heligan saint austell,positive,We travelled by private car.  There were lots of disabled parking spaces.  
the lowry salford,negative,"Car park is Multi-storey across the street and 5 min walk.  Tram link connecting to Manchester although quite a distance to walk to -we did it in 15mins. Good taxi rank directly outside It's not very easy to get there on public transport from where I live (even though it's not far!) so I took a taxi which was able to stop very close to the entrance. Parked in shopping centre next door, undercover and plenty of bays available.  Staff a bit rude when I just checked if we had to pay with a blue badge (you do, just like everyone else apparently!!)    * Edit parking is now free with a blue badge :) * Meets minimum standards, and are very clean.  No hoist or changing beds. Fortunately there is a large bit of work surface in baby change area by the sink that we could lift little one onto to be changed."
the lowry salford,positive,"Toilets are good and clean. The are big enough for turning room.  No seats for a carer although ample room.  Quite a long sloped floor from main floor to toilet on ground floor - gradient compiles but length makes getting back to main floor for theatre, cafe, bar, shops can be difficult without assistance. Very large and clean but there was a bin in the transfer space (hence I knocked a star off). Doesn't have a RADAR lock.  They appeared to have one in the gents and one in the ladies. really easy by car bus train or tram toilet was large and clean you do not need a radar key"
the macallan aberlour,positive,Drove to site outside Dufftown. Not sure if there are public transport options. well signposted and easy to find.  Internal roads signposted and parking well laid out
the machair bar glasgow,negative,No dedicated accessible loo. Ladies' through reasonably heavy door and then standard cubicles.
the machair kitchen tarbert,positive,"Designated generous disabled parking , in front of entrance All Tarmac  Fully equipped disabled toilet, all modern facilities and spotless. Plenty of room to manoevere wheelchair"
the magic mushroom billericay,negative,"We drove, there is a small car park for users of the restaurant on the opposite side of the fairly quiet road. No disabled bays. It was early evening and not busy. We managed to park where no-one could park beside my door so that I could transfer to my wheelchair.  There is a main bus route nearby (A129). There were two large toilet cubicles accessible from the restaurant. One was slightly larger than the other with an outward opening door. There were no grab rails and it would have been a very tight squeeze for a carer. "
the maid of muswell london,positive,Free side road parking Easy access
the mailbox lincoln,negative,The bar is on the high street so there is no disabled parking in the immediate vicinity..
the mailbox lincoln,positive,Decent sized  toilet. Not enough room to spin around 360° and you might need to ask people sat near the door to move if you want to come in and out of it.
the main course gullane,negative,"Easy parking on street outside restaurant, good bus service to Gullane from Edinburgh or from North Berwick but no train station nearest station is NorthBerwick."
the main course gullane,positive,A Loo for disabled people is available but  I didn't see inside . Restaurant is on the main street with a bus stop close by.  There are three blue badge parking spaces within 50 metres but when we arrived they were taken up by three cars not displaying badges.  Managed to park not far away so not a problem. A good sized disabled toilet.  Very clean.  
the mall london,negative,Accessible toilets are available in the adjacent St. james Park. It a bit of a distance but better than nothing at all.
the maltings theatre cinema berwick upon tweed,positive,"The car park is situated immediately outside the Maltings entrance. There are 44 spaces, 8 of which are for the use of disabled badge holders. The car park is situated within easy access of the town's main street. There is a disabled toilet available at the Maltings accessed via the lift."
the man behind the curtain leeds,positive,On street parking nearby with designated blue badge parking. Parking also in the nearby multi storey. 
the manifold way grindon,negative,"You need your own transport as its a bit remote.  There's a car park at Weags Bridge, nearest village is Grindon. You'll need a map reader or satnav to find it.  There's a  small car park, which will get crowded in summer weekend periods. No disabled spaces. However we had no problems. The surface is Tarmac but not completely smoothe. However I didn't find it an issue. If you start at Wetton Mill tearoom instead, there is limited parking there - but since this is by the tearoom, I presume that's for customers?"
the manifold way grindon,positive,Accessible loo at Wetton Mill tearoom.   It was spacious and reasonably well kitted out (though I seem recall the loo was quite low).  Bit of a lip to wheel over to access the loo block. Not radar key operated. No facilities at Weags Bridge.
the manor house hotel holy island,negative,We parked outside the village and I used my wheelchair trike.  There was a small car park and I don't recall any blue badge spaces but can't swear to it! However not all spaces taken - though this wasn't peak season or a weekend.
the manor house hotel holy island,positive,"Brilliant - roomy enough to manoeuvre wheelchair inside, plenty of grab rails, super clean. All loos should be like this!"
the masons arms camelford,negative,See above
the masons arms solihull,positive,"Well laid out, slightly tight for wheelchair, though far better than others I have used, it is an older building. Generally, very clean, just some clean bits of toilet paper/towels on floor, blame previous users. Access from lower area requires assistance if using wheelchair, ramp less than perfect. Overall, better than many I have found in new builds, do they ever ask potential users!"
the master builders bucklers hard,positive,We didn't see any designated disabled parking spaces however there was plenty of space in the hotel car park. Needed to cross the gravel car park before reaching the patio.
the maynard arms london,negative,"Apparently they do have a disabled toilet, but it cannot be accessed by wheelchair as it is on a different level"
the mcmanus dundees art gallery museum dundee,negative,"We got a taxi here which was able to drop us very close to the main entrance. I'm not too familiar with Dundee's public transport, but the museum is at an intersection of various main roads."
the mcmanus dundees art gallery museum dundee,positive,"You can't fault the parking with a couple of good sized accessible parking bays to the rear / side of the building. If you're visiting by bus there seemed to be lots of buses buzzing by. It's also a short walk from the City Square. If coming by train it is about a twenty minute walk. The accessible loo is located on the lower floor and is adjacent to the standard toilets. It has lots of space, grab rails and a changing bench but doesn't have a hoist.  I arrived in Dundee by public transport (train) and made my way around the city using a manual wheelchair with power assisted by a Batec. It was simple enough to get to the McManus from the train station. I did notice a couple of accessible parking bays in the forecourt of the McManus. The accessible loo was easy to find and was spacious enough for me. It had a large changing table too, which some people may find useful. The toilets are down a floor but they are large and tidy with great wheelchair access. 2 Blue Badge spaces near back door.  Other disabled parking on nearby streets.  Close to bus-stops and taxi-rank. Changing places toilet.  Toilet seat loose on visit - reported to staff - should be fixed. There was a disabled toilet signposted but I did not use it"
the medicine garden downside,negative,3 blue badge parking spaces near to entrance. You would need a car to visit.
the medicine garden downside,positive,We drove and were delighted to find a spacious car park with overflow.
the merchant leeds,positive,This venue has a disabled toilet that was relatively simple for me to navigate in my powerchair though a radar key was required. 
the met bury,positive,you can get the bus or tram we drove but it does not have a carpark there is disabled parking a a few streets away there is a disabled toilet bit basic but does the job
the metropole lounge at the hilton cardiff,negative,I don't know because I don't drive. Taxis very close by in Park Place. Plenty with ramps. Multistorey public carpark in Greyfriars Road.
the metropole lounge at the hilton cardiff,positive,My only complaint is that there are no signs on the doors of the two accessible loos which are just inside the entrance.
the metropolitan museum of art new york,positive,"I would recommend using the Bus system, take a bus up Madison Ave and get off at 86th street and walk westwards towards the park. Entrance is to the left of the main steps. All bathrooms were accessible, but not up to the standard of the UK or Japan."
the midland hotel morecambe,positive,"Disabled parking spaces near the ramp Signposted, large luxurious toilet with plenty of room for wheelchair access Accessible parling spaces at the front of the hotel adjacent to the two ramps (left and right) of hotel entrance. There are a number of accessible rooms with large bathrooms and accessible loos. Loos can also be found on the foyer , bar and conference facility areas."
the midland tapas and wine bar beaumaris,positive,Plenty parking in the town and also disabled free parking opposite the Pier. Both within walking distance. Accessible toilet.
the mile castle newcastle upon tyne,negative,"The accessible toilet is on the second floor and is reached via a platform lift. There is no signage to this toilet. There is an obscure door leading from the main bar to the platform lift, with no signage on it. The lift is fine. The toilet itself would be fine if the thoughtless staff hadn't placed two bins in the wheelchair transfer area, see my picture below."
the mile castle newcastle upon tyne,positive,"The branch of Wetherspoons is very near the Central Station Metro stop which, like all Metro stops, is fully step-free. Several bus routes also serve this central area of town."
the milk barn falkirk,positive,2 disabled parking bays right at the door Great disabled toilet
the mill arts and events centre rayleigh,positive,There is a reasonable sized car park right nearby with 5 disabled spaces right next to the ticket machine. Parking is free on Sundays. This venue is just behind the High Street so there are plenty of buses.
the mill at rode rode,positive,Car park is sizeable.  No problems here.
the mill at sonning reading,positive,"The theatre is in a village which a 10 minute taxi ride from Reading Station. Reading Station has step free access and the taxi rank is immediately outside of the station. The taxi was able to drop off/ pick up directly outside the theatre.  Taxi from Reading Station cost about £12 - 14 (2017).  There is no local bus service. There is a car park. There was a disabled accessible toilet on the 1st floor but there was a queue, so unable to comment as I used the ladies toilets. A least one of the cubicles in the ladies has a single grab rail to aid transfer.  Update from further visit in March 2018 when I did use the accessible toilet. It's located on the first floor and is a spacious cubicle with grab rails but no emergency cord.   UPDATED 2019:  Accesssble toilet has been refurbished and there is a brand spanking new accessible toilet, with lots of grab rails and an emergency cord which reached to the floor. Brilliant. Thank you Mill at Sonning it looks amazing."
the mill cafe tillicoultry,positive,Lots of disabled parking spaces at both entrances and all parking is free. There is a bus stop close by on first bus 52. Easy to open and close door with all appropriate hand rails but not much space to transfer if that is required 
the mill centre bathgate,positive,I am aware that there is a bus stop at the back of the centre next to the car park and there is also one out the front. It is on the main road running through Blackburn towards Bathgate and stands out quite well. At the back of the centre there is fair sized car park which is shared with the Partnership Centre. Unfortunately there are not many disabled parking spaces who those who need them. The nearest train station is in Bathgate which is approximately a  45 minute walk away.
the millstream marden,positive,"There is only one disabled parking place, and the marking is a bit faded"
the moat house annan,negative,"On street parking in front of the property. We actually parked fully on the pavement, giving sufficient space to lower wheelchair ramp at rear of vehicle. This gives direct access to front door immediately beside. Small / gentle concrete incline to front door. Unfortunately their is a small lip to negotiate at the fresh hold of the door and we found it easier going in backwards than forwards. Once inside the property all areas fully accessible on wooden floors."
the moat house annan,positive,"We parked on the pavement outside the Moat House and this was satisfactory. Bathroom was splendidly equipped including an X-Y ceiling hoist and a Closomat. There is parking outside the house with space for wheelchair ramp.  Downstairs bathroom has a hoist and accessible shower for wheelchair users.  Parking immediately outside the house and easy to stop/drop off away from or close to the kerb, depending on needs of passengers. 2 accessible toilets - 1 in each shower/bathroom, with arm rests/grab rails Street parking out side the house, with plenty parking space any time. We drive a big VW Van. Bathrooms are very well adopted, with plenty of space even for 3 people, ground one is fitted with track hoist and hoisted shower bed and top one has a wet room shower. With wide doors, grab rails, alarm systems. Excellent - see website / photos for detailed spec - meets a broad range of requirements. We drove with one of our own wheelchair accessibke vehicles and a hired van. There always was a spot free right opposite the propery - side street parking. Plenty of space to manoeuvre the wheelchair in the toilet and sufficient heights of the bathroom facililties. "
the moat house stafford,negative,"For this review PART THREE of Moathouse visit, we can only give 1.5 stars for parking for disabled, as it’s a long haul of push and pulls to get you up and into the bar area.   The disabled toilet is miles away, having to go out and round to reception area, but if you can manage it, there are ladies and gents in the pub itself. For this review, PART TWO, the car parking is not quite so good, as you still need to park by the hotels reception entry. There are four disabled bays for you. But then it’s a push and pull effort to get to ponds and canalside. We can only offer one star on this particular PART TWO review, as to get to disabled toilet you have to go round and down the slope to hotel entrance, up the ramp, in through a pull handled doorway, and round to toilets.  However, this is clean and tide, spacious enough with grab rails if needed."
the moat house stafford,positive,"Driving to hotel was a pleasure (well, after getting off M6) the village of Acton Trussell is very nice, and exciting to get first view of hotel. There are disabled parking bays available right by hotel entrance. There was a disabled toilet by reception and that was easy enough, very clean, nicely tiled, pull handles, and enough space to turn around in there. Toilet in the bar area was just ladies and gents and a lot smaller."
the moody cow farm shop cafe and bistro aberaeron,positive,Plenty of parking on rough gravelly surface but easy to push wheelchair on...disabled spaces on concrete hardstanding.
the moorings hotel fort william,positive,You park at the front of he hotel and make your way  around to the back  to the restaurant however the signposting is not great and we entered through the front doors. The staff were brilliant and got out ramps to get us through the hotel rather than let us go back out into the cold. New facilities are excellent.
the moorings paphos,negative,We did not see any parking nearby The Moorings has an accessible toilet but I didn't use it.
the morecambe bay partnership kendal,positive,The parking is in the Clocktower Business Park car park . The two trampers are kept in a shed adjacent to the car park. There is no public transport to this venue
the mossy paisley,positive,"By car, accessible by bus (main road) Small gravel car park and side street parking. Clean tidy and roomy"
the mountain coffee co gairloch,negative,The toilet is just about large enough to get a wheelchair in. however it's in a very narrow corridor with an unfortunate angle to it. i was glad of my sherpa (thanks mum!)
the mountain coffee co gairloch,positive,you'll need a car as it's up the top of a very steep hill. There is a small car park
the mulberry farnham,negative,"They are just outside a train station with a lot of taxis operating and a large car park but they are on a hill so the journey from car park to pub was difficult. They have their own small carpark but no lines for spaces or disabled bays and it is very steeply sloped. The hallway to the disabled toilets was very narrow and had very little room to turn in. There was a coded padlock on the disabled toilet that only a manager knew the combination to. When the manager opened the door it was full of storage. There was a basket in the doorway which because of the sink I couldn't push it out the way and couldn't fit in the door, there were 4 very large speakers stacked in there and some other things that meant I couldn't use it. The manager had to come back and empty out the room for me."
the mulberry norwich,positive,Easily accessible and reasonably large.
the mumbai mansion edinburgh,negative,Across the road from Haymarket Station and on several bus routes.
the museum of cannock chase cannock,negative,"Toilet is small, we left chair outside, but it’s clean and well looked after, with a grab rail."
the museum of cannock chase cannock,positive,"It was easy enough to find, with plenty of parking for such a small museum."
the museum of methodism john wesleys house london,positive,"I travelled by public transport. The nearest tube stations are Old Street and Moorgate, neither of which are step free. The nearest step free tube station is King's Cross and from there you can take the 214 bus which stops almost outside the Museum/ Chapel. There is an accessible toilet in the crypt, which is accessible via a lift or stairs. It's spacious and clean with grab rails. The emergency cord was short (sorry forgot to bring my red Euan's cord cards with me that day). There is a sign on the wall saying ""the light in the toilet automatically switches off after 5 minutes and I wasn't sure where you could switch it back on. "
the musical museum brentford,positive,"Close bus stop and good parking, but pavements a bit rough and nearest station isn't step free. There was an accessible loo but I didn't use it."
the mustard seed perth,positive,"There are 4 disabled spaces, but none were available when we arrived so we parked somewhere else.  There is a large car park and regular handy bus route. Couldn't find the toilet initially so asked a member of staff who pointed me in the right direction.  Toilet was fine and plenty of grab rails etc."
the national archives richmond,negative,"I found public transport to the National Archives as a person with a mobility disability extremely frustrating. However, once I arrived it was really worth the effort, so please don't be put off. The nearest tube station is Kew Gardens. It has limited accessibility for people with mobility disabilities. While there are ramps so wheelchair users can access both platforms, there is no lift interchange between the two sides of the station.  This means that people travelling towards Richmond on exiting find themselves on the same side of the railway line as the archives. However people travelling from Richmond into Central London, are on the opposite side of the railway line from the archives and as there is no step free interchange they have to have take an extended route around the railway line to get to the archives. On the National Archives website there is a helpful map outlining the route. Alternatively the R68 bus stops at the Kew Retail Park, which is nearby and also stops outside Richmond Station. (Given that Kew Gardens tube station is also the stop for the  famous gardens, a world heritage site, it is deeply disappointing that there isn't better accessibility). They also have car parking."
the national archives richmond,positive,"There are accessible toilets on each floor. However when I arrived I looked for the toilet on the ground floor and it wasn't easy to identify where the accessible toilet was. I saw a general sign for toilets, which was in the conference area part of the building and asked at the desk if there was an accessible toilet there and I was informed that the toilets were in the main archive area. I didn't see any sign for an accessible toilet on  the ground floor. I ended up going into the ladies toilet next to the café, even though it had on accessible toilet sign on the door. I had to walk past about 5 or 6 cubicles as an accessible toilet was on the far end of the row from the door. The door did not have a sign on it saying it was accessible, I worked it out for myself that it might be given that the cubicle was larger than the others. The cubicle was spacious, clean, had grab rails and an emergency cord. However the website describes the ground floor accessible toilet as being"" near the welcome desk, opposite the Security Control Room"", so maybe there is a different toilet. I saw the first floor accessible toilet which was near to the lift as that was clearly sign posted but I didn't use it. It would be helpful if the ground floor accessible toilet was better sign posted."
the national bowl milton keynes,positive,"There is disabled parking near the stage which you have to book in advance or you can do what we did and spend the night at the nearby Premier inn, 5 mins walk away.To come from the train station is difficult as a long walk or by taxi which can't drop you nearby so still a walk."
the national gallery london,negative,"Several bus routes will drop you off in Trafalgar Square but the nearest step-free stations are quite a long way off - Green Park and Westminster. Good accessible toilets in several locations. In the one toilet, the red emergency cord had been tied up out of reach in a complex knot, see my picture below. This is very silly and thoughtless. The red emergency cord should hang freely all the way to the floor so that it can be reached if someone falls to the floor in the often precarious transfer between wheelchair and toilet. In another toilet (see my other picture), the red cord is simply too short. Three stars lost for these failures."
the national hotel dingwall,negative,"From what I could see, there was parking on-street with plenty of space, although no specific accessible spaces. I must admit though, I had already parked outside the football stadium and wheeled round to the hotel in less than 5 mins."
the national hotel dingwall,positive,"Good sized, easily accessible toilets."
the national piping centre glasgow,negative,"There isn't any specific parking available for The National Piping Museum but, there is on street parking available behind the venue that is run by Glasgow City Council and blue badge holders can park for free here. Unfortunately there aren't many dropped kerbs near the on street parking though and I had to drive on the road for a while. I know however this is out with The National Piping Museums control.  For the pop up Piping Live event there was no accessible access. My helper had to move fencing that was set up for the event for myself and other ambassadors to safely get up on to the pavement. Maybe a temporary ramp should be places at the kerb when events are on, like they have when road works are happening.  I am not from Glasgow so, I don't know much about the public transport. The National Piping Museum is located in the centre of Glasgow though."
the national portrait gallery london,negative,"The nearest step-free tube station is probably Green Park, which is quite a long way off. If you're arriving by train at Charing Cross it's only a short distance to the gallery. Several bus routes will drop you off in or near Trafalgar Square. The accessible toilets are good. But the one in the basement, on my previous visit, had its red emergency cord tied up high and out of reach of anyone who might fall to the floor. The luxuriously HUGE toilet near the basement café had its red cord chopped off (see picture)! This is incomprehensibly stupid. These cords should hang freely all the way to the floor so that someone who falls over can summon assistance. Three stars lost for all this."
the national portrait gallery london,positive,"There is no parking on site but there are Blue Badge bays in some nearby streets. The Gallery web site has more information. Public transport in the immediate area is mainly buses. There are several accessible toilets throughout the building. Difficult to comment further than out of Covent Garden Station round the corner and into the Gallery. The nearest tube stations are Charing Cross, Leicester Square and Embankment but none of these stations are step free. The nearest step free station is Green Park from which a bus can take you to Trafalgar Square.   The National Portrait Gallery is adjacent to Trafalgar Square where several buses stop close by.  There are 4 accessible toilets, located on Floors 0, -2, -3, 3. I didn’t use the toilet during my visit."
the national wallace monument stirling,positive,"Getting to the Monument's Visitor Centre was easy as we came by car. A bus service also operates between the National Wallace Monument and Stirling Castle. The accessible parking bays were immediately outside the front door to the Visitor Centre. To get up to the Monument, which is high on the hill about the Visitor Centre, there is a walkway or you can take the courtesy minibus. There is an accessible toilet in the Visitor Centre. A very spacious, clean and bright facility."
the natural history museum london,negative,"I arrived by bus and it wasn't clear how to get there, but my iPhone helped me out. Busses are accessible, but the underground needs improvements. Disabled toilet was hard to find, signs weren't totally clear. The bathroom was too small, there wasn't a bin and needed more work doing as TLC. Not much space, okay as I can stand alone from my chair but think it would be a struggle for anyone needing support There are blue badge spots, however you have to book them as there is only around 5 spots. Its not clearly signposted either of how to get there."
the natural history museum london,positive,"The nearest tube station South Kensington is not step free. Although the Piccadilly, District and Circle line stop there all the platforms involve steps to the ticket office hall level and then further steps to street level. This is really disappointing. There are a number of buses that stop outside or near to the V and A. I would suggest picking up bus no 14 from Green Park which is an step free station. I arrived in a taxi from Victoria with some of my group, as out of the group of 12 - 14 friends, 3 of us had mobility disabilities."
the new calf shed sutton mandeville,positive,"Parking right outside the front door. Accessible bathroom, handrail for toilet, lower sink, wheel-in shower."
the new club edinburgh,positive,The club has dissabled parking and elevator access via their rear doors on Rose Street although calling in advance to confirm your parking is definitely recommended The club has a fully automated disabled toilet with automatic doors and grab rails if required. 
the new harbour cafe shetland,positive,"I honestly can’t remember if there was an accessible toilet in The New Harbour Café however, it was quite small, so I think there was only a male and female toilet. Although there is a Changing Places toilet not far away in the town centre of Lerwick."
the newbridge hotel newbridge,negative,Accessible bus stop but street parking otherwise
the newlands coventry,negative,"Even though I didn't personally use the toilet myself from speaking about this with my friend they said that the toilet was spacious clean and was comfortable enough to fit both a carer and young person in, the one thing that did concern them was that there were no proper locks on the doors of the bathroom so if another person needed the toilet they could walk into another person using the toilet  There was an accessible toilet that had handrails and was of a decent size. However, the door did not have any locking mechanism on it and it was not a changing spaces toilet."
the newport restaurant with rooms newport on tay,negative,"Went here with a private car. Had to park on a main but side road, which wasn’t ideal but didn’t cause any problems, road is very quiet. Unsure if there was disabled parking around the back of the restaurant. "
the newport restaurant with rooms newport on tay,positive,Large accessible toilet in the restaurant area. Clean & plenty of room to move around with a power chair.
the noble comb shipley,negative,"There are 2 disabled parking spaces, and it gets very busy, so spaces are not always available unless you arrive for 11:45 am for your lunch, and by 12:30 there are no parking spaces left at all until the lunchtime rush is over. "
the noble comb shipley,positive,"The disabled toilet was clean. Easy access and a reasonable amount of space for a large power-chair. The red cord was wrapped around the wall bar on arrival, but I untangled it to hang free. Small hand basin, and liquid soap . There is paper towels and a hand dryer.  The waste bin had a pedal as well as lip so could be lifted by hand. No Radar key required as it also doubles up as baby change. "
the nook rothesay,positive,"Two minutes from the ferry. Parking on the main road. Pavement reasonable.  No designated space. No problems, but may be busier in Summer. Spacious.  Not used by me."
the o2 arena london,negative,"Far more accessible toilets required and those that are provided should be radar locked. Please stop lumping disabled access toilets with baby change facilities why is this considered acceptable campaign needed please. Toilets inside arena more needed with radar locks. Outside venue but still in complex only one accessible toilet under stairs near cinema and it's baby change as we'll grrrrrr  not radar locked either . Only alternative is to use a restaurant but this is not ideal . Also toilets in the car park would be good after a long journey it a fair distance to the complex It's a bit confusing on approach as you are told to follow signs for the blackwall tunnel and it is only very close that it suddenly tells you to take the exit just before so unless you are aware and in the correct lane (being the left lane) you end up on a 15 minute trip through the tunnel there and back to get back to the exit!!!  Once there the car park is fairly easy to find and there are quite a few blue badge spaces (not particularly signed but in a fairly obvious position!!) however considering how hard it is for getting to events via public transport for disabled people parking is very expensive with only a very small blue badge reduction.  The walk to the arena is not 100% easy to make without help or power (e.g. electric wheelchair) but not the worst I've ever seen and once onto the actual approach to the O2 it's all fairly smooth and easy. There was one accessible toilet before the actual arena (in the area we were in) and so at times this was being used by lots of people who didn't need to because it was a long queue for the ladies!!  The one accessible loo was only just big enough to fit me my chair and carer in, was also (as often the case) the only baby change and the nappy/incontinence/sanitary bin was overflowing hours before the concert even started.  There was no one managing the toilets to allow disabled people to have priority and thought that it was quite appalling that (although I don't need it) there was no changing places so anyone needing this sort of facility would have been forced to use the floor which would only have been big enough for a smaller person and although there were grab rails and an emergency cord there was no hoist or anything like that.  I didn't use the toilets within the arena itself (once past security for the event) and so didn't notice what was available there, but judging from the other facilities I can't see it having been any different. The parking spaces were good, lots of them and nice and wide etc.  It's a shame however that you have to pay so much to park there, I know it's to encourage public transport use but when you're in a wheelchair it's not that easy.  I would have given more but the cost added to nearly 25 minutes to get out because of sheer volume of traffic trying to get through 2 barriers and I think that there must be a better way!! ONE toilet with baby change in it, staff wanting to change the bin before me going in after having waiting 20 minutes for 4 families to change their children's nappies and toilet paper being on the cystern at the back which meant twisting round to get it meant that I wouldn't give higher.  The toilet in the priority lounge didn't have an emergency cord which would have meant no help had I fallen, but at least this loo was cleaner tidier, not a baby change and a much shorter queue!! The Tube station at North Greenwich is very well laid out and joins up with the bus station but is is a very hefty walk to the Arena.  Although getting to the station  via a step free way or least amount of walking is very difficult via Zone 1.  The best route for me I have found is H&C line from Kings Cross to Mile End, Change at Mile end to Stratford (platforms are next to each other) and then CL to Stratford to North Greenwhich on the Jubilee Line."
the o2 arena london,positive,"Pre booked disabled parking is cheaper at 13 ukp and can easily be paid and booked on line or by phone .number plate recognition means no ticket as machine welcomes you by name and gives access to car park one closest to the arena The O2 Arena, London is very easily accessible and the local transport caters for those with disabilities such as having step-free access at all platforms at North Greenwich (the closest station), as well as lifts between platforms. The O2 Arena has disabled access parking in close proximity. I do not drive, so I am unsure of the parking aspect. But the public transportation to get here, especially the tube is fantastic. Step all the way through, and the Jubilee Line is one of the cleaner lines on the underground. I found the loos to be perfect for my needs, they were easy to use, but please note I do not require a changing table or hoists etc.  Whenever I used the facilities, they were not dirty, so I think they do really well with keeping it in tip top shape.  There is plenty of disabled parking available, and it's possible (and advisable) to book and pay for this in advance. Discounts are available for blue badge holders. Assistance is available, if needed, to get you from the car to the venue. The car park is a fair distance from the entrance, and there's a road that needs to be crossed. There is also a drop-off area approx. 150m from the main entrance. The O2 can also be accessed by tube and various bus routes as well as via the Thames Clipper. The nearest tube station (North Greenwich) is reportedly fully accessible. There are accessible toilets situated throughout the venue, including near to the entrance to each of the accessible viewing areas. These are of variable size and design, and include at least one with a hoist. When you could get to them they were clean and well maintained. It seemed that there was nowhere enough of them and they seemed to be in sections that when I was trying to get out of the arena at the end of the night I was told I couldn't go to the nearest one as I needed a ""VIP ticket"" to use it even though I had used it on the way in. vip disabled toilets have a hoist but thing these should be in normal toilets to! You'll never have a problem getting a parking space. However the distance from the Car park to the arena is quite a trek if you have walking issues. No problems if you're in a power chair \ scooter. Perfect. Always clean and plenty of them."
the oberoi mumbai mumbai,negative,One on Pool level but none on lobby level. 
the oberoi mumbai mumbai,positive,Valet parking available. 
the observatory restaurant edinburgh,positive,"There's a large taxi rank at the front of the building and regular busses passing by. There isn't any on-street parking, but there are a few large indoor car parks at nearby John Lewis. The pedestrian path leading up to the building is exceptionally wide and smooth. "
the officers club paisley,positive,Parking available on first level of car park
the old bank city pub and chop house carlisle,negative,There are disabled parking in the street nearby but it can take a while to get a space There is a toilet that the restraunts can use on a balcony one level up via a lift. The restaurant staff will show you where it is and unlock it. It isn't huge and turning space is limited so you may need to reverse out. I'd advice having someone with you to help with the door. The centre of Carlisle is quite old so access is difficult to find. The slight awkwardness of this toilet is worth the compromise 
the old boatyard seafood restaurant arbroath,positive,Council car park around harbour adjacent to restaurant.  Very clean with hand 4 handrails.
the old brewery london,positive,"The pub is a few minutes walk from Cutty Sark DLT step free station.  There was an accessible toilet in a corridor outside of the pub passed the gallery area. I'm unsure if there were any toilets immediately within the pub area. The accessible toilet was also used as a baby changing place. While waiting to use the toilet I had to stand in an narrow corridor. The accessible toilet was spacious, with grab rails and emergency cord. Loads of different ways to get to Greenwich - we took the Riverboat which was fun in itself! The pier is a couple of minutes from the Old Brewery just past the Cutty Sark. We went back into London via the Docklands Light Railway which we find very accessible - that was about 15 mins away from the Old Brewery - mainly because there were so many people to navigate!"
the old chain pier edinburgh,negative,"As a warning, there are half a dozen steps down to the toilets, though with the age of the building and its listed status, this cannot be held against the business. Using a symbol cane, this was no problem for my mother however this would be an entirely different matter if one of us were a wheelchair user."
the old chain pier edinburgh,positive,"There's a bus stop directly opposite and parking available very close by, just off the road where the pub is situated, on Newhaven's side streets"
the old clubhouse gullane,positive,Plenty of off street parking just outside the club house. No  Blue badge needed.  Parking is free.  The disabled toilet  is spacious but it does not have an emergency red cord.  See photo.
the old farmhouse totton,negative,"Just the two disabled bays Large toilet meaning you can manoeuvre easily in your wheelchair,   but the lock is broken so you need someone to watch the door. It could also do with some bleach - yuck."
the old fire station oxford,positive,"The city centre is pretty easy mostly for wheelchairs, as it's flat. There are disabled parking bays nearby on New Inn Hall Street and Beamont Street. You can also park in residents' only bays if you have a blue badge. Upstairs, theatre loo is good. There's another downstairs but if you're a wheelchair user, you'll have trouble getting the connecting door open. Once inside, it's bigger and clean and there's a roll in shower. "
the old horse leicester,positive,"Car park available, plus on street parking after 6pm Great"
the old library waterfoot,positive,As mentioned very spacious with full changing table and hoist for an adult user . 
the old lodge minchinhampton,negative,Spacious offroad type parking.
the old lodge minchinhampton,positive,wheelchair accessible toilet available
the old manor hotel lundin links,positive,"Two dedicated blue badge parking spaces one the right hand side of the car park.   There is a 3rd space through the gap between Saddler's Bistro) and the hotel entrance.   Local bus service (Stagecoach no 95) double decker runs hourly between St Andrews and Leven and stops close to the hotel. NB For single decker buses (X58, X60, X62),. powered wheelchair and mobility scooter users require a permit - call 01333 426038 or email aberhill.disabilityhelpdesk@stagecoachbus.com to discuss. There are two accessible toilets - one to the right of the stairs opposite the entrance to the lounge/ bar area and one Just off the Largo function suite."
the old market hove,negative,"Parking in Hove is pretty difficult, and there are very few disabled parking spaces. I parked about 200m away and walked (I use a stick) - the venue is on quite a steep hill. Blue badge holders can park free and for unlimited time on street in pay and display bays, but not in permit holders bays."
the old market hove,positive,"It was in the basement, accessed by a small lift, and fairly difficult to see the signage. Very spacious though. Not terribly clean, but it was an hour into a sold out gig."
the old mill harvester bridgend,positive,Only 2 spaces but is a small harvester
the old mill inn pitlochry,negative,"Always have walked here, though I didn't see any parking spaces near by, I am pretty sure that cars and taxis will be able to drive up to the front entrance and drop people off. It's just off the high street so not too far away from public transport either. "
the old mill inn pitlochry,positive,Accessible loo available for to take a pic.
the old mill tea room dawlish,positive,"The nearest station is Dawlish train station. There is step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station. There are step free, local buses that stop close by. The tea rooms are a couple of minutes level walk from the station."
the old plough cobham,negative,Accessible loo with plenty of space but why store a chair in there ?! 
the old plough cobham,positive,The pub is very close to the railway station and has one disabled space next to the rear entrance. 
the old spring well harrogate,positive,There is multiple disabled parking spaces outside of the pub. All are straight outside the door and easy to spot when you enter the car park.  Large accessible toilets for wheelchair users. 
the old station st andrews,positive,"Disabled room on ground floor and there is a door nearby with paving slabs outside. You can park next to the paving. Devon rail on one side of toilet, fixed bar on the other, heightened bowl. Remarkable for a B & B."
the olde coach house inn ashby saint ledgers,negative,"The loo was OK, fair amount of room.  Only gripe - a bit cold as it was near an open door....brrr"
the olympic museum lausanne,positive,"Disabled parking very limited, but public transport is excellent and highly accessible."
the open arms hotel dirleton,negative,"No public transport.  No blue badge parking but if you let the hotel know when you book, you can park at the front door.  However, there is an area covered in gravel between parking and the front door - not great for wheelchairs!  Also, there is a 25mm step to get in. Again, not great. Access is tight unless you have a standard manual wheelchair.  It is further compromised by the fact that the handrail doesn't lock up.  It is, however, very clean."
the oracle reading,positive,Great parking options and bus stops from all sides
the orange tree richmond,negative,"There is a generally well-laid-out accessible toilet at the back of the back bar, secured by a RADAR key lock. Mysteriously, the staff keep their RADAR key in the basement, not in the bar (why???!), so you may encounter a delay if you don't have your own RADAR key.  There are some bad features of this toilet.  - I found the red emergency cord tied up out of reach, this is very thoughtless, dangerous and silly. This cord must reach all the way to the floor so that it can be reached by anyone who falls over in the often perilous transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back.  - The RADAR lock was broken. It cannot be raised to the 'locked' position. This means that I was unable to lock myself into the toilet, so that anyone else with a RADAR key would have been able to gain entry while I was in the middle of doing my business, with my trousers down. This is TOTALLY NOT-OK! The RADAR lock needs to be replaced with one that works correctly.  - The hand-dryer was much too high on the wall for a wheelchair user to reach. It's incomprehensible that anyone could have decided to install it at that height in a toilet specifically designed and intended for wheelchair users.  See my pictures below.  I spoke to a deputy manager in January 2019 about these problems, she listened sympathetically and was sweetness itself, but by September 2019 these problems have not been fixed, which is very disappointing. "
the orange tree richmond,positive,"Richmond Station is a stone's throw away and is step-free to train (District Line, but take care choose the optimal place on the platform where the gap between platform and train is narrowest), and step-free to platform (London Overground and National Rail - talk to staff before travelling as they will need to deploy a manual boarding ramp).  Lots of bus routes run past the pub.  I wouldn't dream of trying to park nearby. (If I did dream about it, it would be a bad dream.)  "
the orangery north berwick,positive,"There were 6 blue badge parking spaces immediately by the front door.   Pathway from car park to entrance should be extended by 2 slabs to avoid going on gravel, which is not good for wheelchairs. Toilet good size for both electric and manual wheelchairs. "
the orchard theatre dartford,positive,Can book car park space same time as booking tickets. Parking is close to venue and in an exclusive carpark.
the original bierkeller lincoln,positive,"There are parking spaces available on Silver Street, not immediately outside the bar, But a little further along the street. There is a disabled toilet with a radar lock on it. It is a good size, with enough room for me to turn my powerchair around, and there is enough space for my carer as well. There is a grab rail.  However, I have noticed that sometimes the staff use the disabled toilet. I'm not sure why. There are able-bodied toilets downstairs."
the orkney museum kirkwall,negative,"Parking is on street or in nearby car parks.  A regular accessible toilet, however it was very clean and had electronic locking. "
the outsider restaurant edinburgh,negative,"It is on a very busy street with limited parking. We walked from quite far away.  See above. Fine with blue badge. There are some bus stops on George IV Bridge, the number 23, 27, 41 and 42 stop there. I think it might be on some of the tour bus routes too. Parking isn't great nearby. You might be lucky and get a space on Chambers Street. The restaurant is walkable from Waverley Station but it is up a steep hill. "
the outsider restaurant edinburgh,positive,Large accessible toilet on the ground level. Was able to move and turn in my wheelchair. Not used but pointed out by waiter as sat at table.
the pack horse leeds,positive,There is a disabled access toilet with reasonable space inside to move around. A radar key is required. 
the paddle steamer largs,positive,"We arrived by train. The pub is about 10 minutes walk away. The pavements don't all have dropped kerbs, your best option is to cross the road when you leave the train station and then cross back over when you are at the Costa (Wetherspoons is a couple of doors along from Costa). To access the platform lift we walked past the entrance facing the road and round the building to the side facing the sea. You walk past a second entrance and then you will see the platform lift and a door nearby. There is a bus stop right outside the pub for those travelling by bus. It is right next to the Largs Ferry Terminal so very handy for anyone arriving on the ferry or could be used as a rest stop before a journey on the ferry. The nearest car park is Seafront Carpark which is a short distance away. This could be accessed by the promenade, which is a nice seafront walkway which is flat and wide. This toilet was an OK size with a red cord that hung correctly all the way to the floor. There were some bins in the transfer area which could easily be moved nearer the door. To access the toilet you had to go through two quite heavy doors."
the painswick stroud,negative,Small car park with no designated disabled parking
the palace hotel paignton,positive,"There is excellent public transport links. Paignton Train Station , which has step free access, is a 10 minute level walk. There are numerous buses that stop near by. Almost directly outside is the bus stop for the number 22 bus, which goes into Torquay and beyond. There is a car park, which had disabled parking bays near the entrance.  The car park has an automatic gate. The hotel is very centrally located, directly opposite Paignton Pier, although the hotel stands back from the seafront.   Accessible public toilet on the ground floor which was spacious, clean and with grab rails and alarm. There is also an accessible toilet in the accessible shower room in the Genisis Health Suite. There was a standard toilet in my bedroom and didn't have grab rails."
the palais dundee,negative,"It's on a busy road near bus stops, but I'm not sure where the nearest parking would be. At the moment there is lots of scaffolding outside which does make the path a little narrower than usual. There is one toilet in the tea room and it is spacious with hand rails. It does not have an emergency cord however. "
the palmer arms dorney,positive,"Yep, close to the restaurant, all clean and tidy. Staff have a key if it's locked."
the pantheon rome,negative,Limited street parking -  I would go on foot.
the pantheon rome,positive,"You can get accessible public transport that stops close to here. A lot more on Rome's buses are now accessible. There are parking areas close to here, but I'm not sure how many are disabled parking bays."
the paper boat aberfeldy,negative,No specific disabled parking spces but no problem in finding suitable space (nose in facing the water and unloading the scooter from the boot).
the paper boat aberfeldy,positive,"Not a changing places loo but a perfectly normal clean facility.  No problems. It is not particularly well signposted but a really pleasant surprise to stumble across it.  Kenmore itself is a really small place and only has one hotel which we did not visit so it would be unfair to comment on it but the entire area is a pleasure to visit. Parking is available outside there are not a lot of spaces, the road along to The Paper Boat Café is very narrow, be mindful of pedestrians and on coming vehicles. There is a disabled toilet right next to main toilets, signed posted well and enough room for a carer."
the park at owa foley,positive,"Heavy doors but once in, very spacious and accessible. Restrooms were spread out across the park. "
the park bistro linlithgow,positive,"Two designated Blue Badge spaces in the car park. Did not use public transport so cannot comment. Accessible toilet off main restaurant area. Corridor has seating stored to the left side but still wide enough to negotiate. Left transfer onto toilet. Grab rails either side of toilet and a wash hand basin. No emergency cord. Seating outdoors - not tried as it was raining. No Public Transport. Blue Badge parking by front door. Large car park, on the level with the restaurant, plenty of disabled parking, clearly marked, restaurant staff saw us coming and opened door for me - I was pushing my daughter.  Also - restaurant on a level with the towpath on the Union Canal - it's easy to walk there from Linlithgow, and to explore the canal-side after a meal."
the park medical practice derby,negative,There is a basic accessible loo but it isn't the greatest because you have to go through a door into baby changing facilities then try and navigate around a huge bin to open door into the toilet.   There is limited transfer space on either side of toilet. Front transfer would likely be needed unless your chair is tiny. Limited space for carer assistance.   The grab rails are white so not of a contrasting colour. The mirror was okay height for a seated position but the coat hook was too high. 
the park medical practice derby,positive,There are two disabled bays. One is next to door. There is a bus stop on the street outside but the other bus stop to go back the other way is further away and across a busy road. 
the parlour belfast,negative,Buses stop near Queen's University and there is some on street parking but unsure about restrictions.
the parlour belfast,positive,They are at the back of the pub through a door. No key required and they are checked regularly. I could turn in my power chair but might be tight for a wheelchair user inside with a companion.
the pavilions in the park horsham,positive,"Lots of disabled Parking right outside main doors A 'as good as' Changing Places Toilet with Shower Trolley, Shower, hair dryer, Manual Hoist, sit down wall mounted bench with rail, Toilet and sink on the dry side of the swimming pool for open access to the public who just want to use the toilet and NOT swim, also there is the same on the wet side changing rooms for those that do"
the peak at stirling sports village stirling,positive,"There is a large car park with a good number of accessible parking spaces directly outside. The car park has regularly got traffic wardens coming round checking who is in the accessible bays.  There is a bus service that runs just outside the centre but unsure as to what number as I always travel by car.  The train station is about 15 min Wheelchair push away.  There are quite a few accessible toilets  throughout the centre. The smallest of these is located just next to the cafe at the main entrance. The other accessible toilets are a good size all with showering facilities. These are scattered throughout the sports centre including at least 2 upstairs near the gym, 2 near the sports halls, 1 in the ice rink and 1 in the NCA. I did come across one of the toilets that had a bed and portable hoist in but not sure of weight limits etc. I think it would be advisable  Car park is massive but busy there is a couple of them There is plenty of parking -whether disabled or not- outside the sports village and it is completely accessible. There isn't a lot of transport that takes you directly to the doors, but there are several drop off points around the site.  There are disabled bathrooms on both floors that are fully equipped and are large enough to get around. I didn't count the number but there were numerous accessible parking bays outside the front entrance - they had space at the rear of the space and at the side of the space for entrance from both angles. The kerb was dropped to allow wheelchairs access to it and the door was less than 10 metres away.  Let down only by the absence of an official changing places toilet. Everything else was fantastic and spacious. "
the peartree edinburgh,negative,"Parking on street, unsure of time allowance etc. Wouldn't be able to access the building to use them."
the peat inn restaurant with rooms cupar,positive,"On-site parking is free for customers. The car park is situated at the front, side and rear. Guests can be dropped off at the front of the restaurant if required. There are 25 parking spaces. Although there is no specific designated Blue Badge parking, you can let staff know when you book and a space at the front of the restaurant will be reserved for you. The car park surface is gravel (very thin), but it is usually possible to park to avoid having to negotiate it.  We had drivend to the Inn and parked in the side car park, reversing in so that the ramp of our WAV reached the monobloc path. The monobloc path goes from The Residence to the restaurant, around the perimeter of the car park. Restaurant staff are extremely attentive and are on hand to assist if asked.  For full details and maps of how to reach the Peat Inn are available on the website. As it is situated in a rural setting, it is not on a bus route so arriving via your own transport or by taxi is essential.  The nearest railway stations are Leuchars (7.8 miles) and Cupar (6.7 miles). Taxis are available at the station. If you need an accessible taxi, it's best to book in advance with Williamsons on 01334 476787. Moffat and Williamson bus company runs a Flexibus service - details are available from www.go-flexi.org or telephone 01382 540624   The toilets are behind the reception area, including a unisex accessible toilet. There is level access from the reception/ bar. The accessible toilet is small but it accommodated us both - one in a Sunrise Quickie power-chair plus a carer. The wash-hand basin was low enough to allow access for the wheelchair user. Grab rails were black to contrast with the walls. There is no red cord but the working bar is opposite and staff are close by. "
the pen museum birmingham,negative,1 toilet in the museum (It is only a small museum) but would be accessible to all EXCEPT those with older children or adults who have other needs.
the pen museum birmingham,positive,"I saw no disabled parking available on site, but there is on road parking just up the road from the museum.  The museum is also on a bus route which stops right outside. (from Birmingham city centre)"
the peppermill forres,positive,Nearby free parking with disabled bays
the phoenix garden london,positive,"Phoenix Gardens are a hidden away community garden close to Covent Garden, Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street. It's one of those places that you wouldn't know it was there unless you knew about it. However it is very easy to get to by public transport. The nearest tube station is Tottenham Court Road which is step free and about a 5 - 10 minute walk away.  There are several buses, 14, 19, 24, 29, 38, and 176,  that all stop very close by in Charing Cross Road. If going southbound along Charing Cross Road the nearest stop is Cambridge Circus, opposite the Palace Theatre. Going northbound the nearest stop is Denmark Street which is directly outside of Foyles Bookshop.  The entrance to the gardens is in St Giles Passage.   You can either turn into Phoenix Street at the side of the Phoenix Theatre, and the garden will be straight in front of you. You will then need to turn right and walk round the outside of the gardens to reach the entrance on the other side. Or alternatively the gardens can be approached from turning into St Giles Passage from Shaftsbury Avenue.   Please note not all the pavements have dropped kerbs nearby."
the phoenix highlane,positive,The toilet is a good size and well maintained.
the piebald inn filey,negative,I asked if they had an accessible toilet. They said yes but it was down a few steps. That was when they said they had a ramp but I was not keen to try that (they are always too steep) and so I went back to the motorhome and used my own.
the piebald inn filey,positive,We arrived by motorhome. The road in is quite narrow but not that busy so we had no problems. Nice wide entry into a huge car park. We'd booked electrics and they are all along the back edge of the car park. There are some blue badge spaces near to the entrance.
the pier lower upnor,negative,did not visit
the pier lower upnor,positive,Car park at back of venue
the pier sopot,positive,"Easy to find , large size"
the pier stronachlachar,positive,Plenty of spaces close to the building and the pier itself These seemed fine
the pig   on the beach swanage,positive,"The carpark is gravel but two disable parking spaces are adjacent to a flagstone path, on the level and approximately 20m from a wide access door with a very small lip that I could manage by myself.  As we drove I do not know where nearest public transport is. Fully accessible wc with good space and kept immaculately clean."
the pine marten beckwithshaw,negative,"The loo is in one of the restaurants , not adjacent to the main toilets which are upstairs. It takes some finding and I disturbed other diners to reach the loo door. Once inside the loo it takes some manoeuvring to reach the toilet itself. There are support bars and the room is clean but it is not ideal."
the pine marten beckwithshaw,positive,Disable parking bays outside front door. Large accessible lavatory with room for carer. Not signed at all. The loo is off one of the dining areas so worth mentioning when you get your table.  Need radar key or ask staff. With disabled parking right outside the front door and a safe stone ramp upto the door it could not be better for wheelchair users.
the pine marten dunbar,positive,"There are several blue badge spaces with cross hatching on both sides. The rest of the car park is large so there would be room to drop someone off if the spaces were full.   The path from the car park to the entrance is smooth paving. It is not a long way in the accepted sense of the word, but for those like my relative who can only walk very short distances a wheelchair is needed. The photo of the the path is taken from the space we were parked in. There is a lowered kerb beside it. The toilet is very good -  large enough to give room for a wheelchair user and assistant. There is a drop down rail on one side and a fixed rail on the other. (I've noticed that some toilets, even recently refurbished ones, only have a rail on one side which means my relative cannot use them.) The red cord went to the floor.  The toilet is at the opposite end from the entrance so again quite a 'long' distance."
the pitt edinburgh,negative,"They are accessible but they aren't the best. There's not really an accessible toilet as far as I'm aware but there some of sort of baby changing toilet with ample space. Unfortunately this toilet inside didn't lock so anyone could walk in.  Thumbs up for being gender neutral though. I didn't use the toilets when I visited because given the pop-up nature of this market they weren't the best! They are tucked in the corner at the very back and up a set of steps. I didn't see any designated accessible loos, so if they exist they are poorly sign posted. "
the pitt edinburgh,positive,"There is parking on Pitt Street and the streets surrounding there. You can get a 7 or 11 bus near enough to the venue, but unfortunately Pitt Street involves a cobbled road. Pavements are wide enough though."
the pizzeria villaggio cardiff,negative,some parking behind but unsure whether our mobility vehicle would fit under arch.  Disabled spaces available in nearby village CP (free)  300yds.
the pizzeria villaggio cardiff,positive,Accessible loo available and clearly marked but not used this visit.
the play king llanelli,negative,"Out of four disabled spaces three (except mine) had no disabled blue badge, so they do not appear to be enforcing the scheme."
the pleasance edinburgh,positive,Nearby buses but a taxi or car might be better. Spacious and modern 
the plough leatherhead,negative,There is on-site parking but only one disabled space which is a normal size parking space marked for disabled use. 
the plowright theatre scunthorpe,negative,Spaces are limited close to the venue
the plowright theatre scunthorpe,positive,"Large disabled toilet, ample room for carers to assist if required. "
the poplar farm abbotts ann,positive,"Although there is Blue Badge parking by the main entrance, the main car park is away from the restaurant, with steps down to resraurant level.  Disabled loo direct off the restaurant. Grab rails & emergency pull cord."
the portland hotel chesterfield,positive,"Disabled toilet is good but a little bit small, enough room to move around in a powerchair."
the portobello bookshop edinburgh,negative,"I came by bus (Lothian 21, 26, 42, 49, 124 buses pass through here) and I believe there is some curbside parking on the High Street."
the post house coffee co dundee,positive,"The cafe is on the main street in Invergowrie, we’ve been able to park using the blue badge just outside the cafe. There’s also disabled parking bays across the road outside a shop. "
the postal museum london,negative,There is a bus stop just round the corner. Clean and accessible.
the postal museum london,positive,"The nearest step free tube stations are King's Cross and Farringdon. From both these station you can take a number 63 bus to a stop which is a couple of minutes level walk to the museum. Also there are other buses which stop close by. There are accessible toilets in both the main museum building and Mail Rail. In the main building there are toilets on the ground floor next to the self service counter in the café. There are a number of individual unisex toilets, some of  which also have a wheelchair symbol on the door. In the accessible toilets there are grab rails and an emergency alarm, although the cubicle I used the cord was clipped onto the grab rail. In Mail Rail the toilets are on the lower floor. The signage for the accessible toilets in the Mail Rail was non existent. I raised this with staff when I was there and they said they would address it. There is a large screen with seating, which is separate from the  Accessible Rail Mail Show. Either side of the screen are doorways which have the unisex toilet sign at the entrances. There was no accessible toilet sign. Looking face onto the giant screen through the right hand doorway is an accessible toilet with grab rails but no emergency cord and only a unisex toilet sign. There is also another door which has a triangular fire notice on it, which gives the impression of it being a cupboard, and it was only on closer inspection that we realised that the lock was for a radar key. I used my radar key and discovered that it was a Changing Places toilet, with a bed, screen, hoist, grab rail but no emergency alarm."
the pot cardiff,negative,"There is no car park and on-road parking is very difficult. There is a bus stop nearby. East to find, wide door, I didn't notice anything else which makes it particularly suited to a disabled user."
the potting shed tearoom inshriach garden aviemore,negative,"The location is very rural, a small parking area situated across the road from venue. there is a 100-150 meter driveway to reach the cafe. No disabled parking any closer to the building"
the potting shed tearoom inshriach garden aviemore,positive,"There is a small car park across the single track road right at the entrance to the garden. It is impossible to drive right up to the door, but the garden path leading the the tearoom is wide. If you want to take a taxi, it costs around £10 from Aviemore train station."
the press kitchen york,positive,"This restaurant was a two minute walk from our hotel, there was on street parking and its just a few mins from the centre of York, maybe 15 mins walk from the train station.  The toilet was a good size, clean and tidy. The hand wash and hand lotion had brail on to identify each one. There was room to turn and grab rails. The red cord hung to the floor at the left side of the toilet which is also the side one would transfer from. The bin was at that side but it was easy to move it out the way, it didn’t need to be that close to the toilet. "
the principal manchester manchester,negative,"The accessible room in the Palace hotel was amazing! Very big, easy to get around, good bathroom facilities, lift access to the room and a flat main entrance.  This is the only draw back to this hotel; there is no real parking! Around the back of the hotel, down a side street are some parking spaces but there is no wheelchair access to the hotel via the back so you have to go all the way around.  Not ideal at all but is very central to the town centre."
the principal manchester manchester,positive,"Although I cant comment on the public toilet the bathroom in the accessible room I stayed in was very easy! With level access shower, grab rails, shower seat and a big room the bathroom wasn’t just accessible it was a bit of luxury.   This is rare for any hotel accessible bathroom."
the principal york,negative,There is parking available for an additional price. Limited amount of spots designated for people with disablilities.
the principal york,positive,"There are disabled rooms which are very well equipt. The bathroom is large and has grab rails, shower seats and a low bath. The toilets in the lobby of the hotel are easily accessible for people with disabilities."
the printing press bar kitchen edinburgh,negative,Signage could be better as it suggests the lift to the accessible loo is in a different direction to what it actually is. Wheelchair lift down to loos with plenty of space in it. Not far from lift to accessible loo. Explanations within lift re: which floor to choose could be better.
the printing press bar kitchen edinburgh,positive,Taxis can drop off and pick up right outside and (in theory) you can park there but I wouldn't bank on getting a space on George Street
the priory centre saint neots,negative,"The Priory Centre car park is run down. There are only 2 disabled spaces which are hidden away and the markings are almost disappeared!  The one 'disabled' toilet is small. I couldn't fit my power chair in as the doorway was too narrow. The door itself is highly sprung and heavy, which is impossible to use if on your own. There is a weird all in one metal rail that runs from the toilet along the length of the facility. It blocks the sink off too! There are multiple boxed in pipes and so it is very small. The toilet is low down and there is no easy way of getting up. The sink is so small and inaccessible. To dry your hands there is a blue paper towel dispenser. "
the priory harvester gloucester,positive,3 disabled parking spaces outside.
the puffin bistro wine bar north berwick,negative,"Being on the High street parking is a bit hit or miss, however 50 yards around the corner there is a disabled parking space, with a few other Disabled parking spaces within walking distance. "
the puffin bistro wine bar north berwick,positive,"I did not visit the toilet myself however the carer that was with me always checks out how easy to find, how accessible and how clean the disabled toilets are and I was given a 5 star report.  North Berwick High Street can be a bit of a nightmare to park in. We were very lucky and parked right outside hence the 5 star rating. If you are unlucky you might find you have to park a long way away. A very large, well appointed toilet. Not quite big enough to turn around in but great all the same. "
the puffing billy exton,positive,"There is adequate parking within their carpark. But there are also level access spaces in the surrounding Road. Clearly signed. Good facilities. There are two doors, which could cause some issues, but staff are quick to help if needed. But having two doors helps for people's who's condition can be embarrassing."
the punchbowl solihull,negative,"I couldn't see any disabled parking spaces. Plenty of other parking but... There is a disabled access toilet with rails. But it was really smelly and unpleasant to use. Also there is a tiny dip in the floor between the bar and the toilet. (About the thickness of a floor tile) It is not marked out and was enough to cause me to stumble. A little step to get over whichever way you go to the toilets, and quite small inside, with just basic needs."
the punchbowl solihull,positive,"Driving here was a pleasure, it’s through pleasant countryside, and inviting looking inn as you arrive. No disabled bays, but all parking reasonably close to entrance anyway. "
the purple partridge raskelf,positive,"Drove from Thirsk , big gravel car park Accessible large enough for wheelchairs to manoeuvre around in"
the quaich cafe fochabers,positive,You can park on the high street next to the coffee shop Basic disabled toiled but had everything I needed.
the quarry and the dingle shrewsbury,positive,"There are disabled toilets located at the top of the quarry park area, near the main gates. There are disabled parking but if the isn't any space there are more further in town. Near the playground accessible toilets, have to find a park staff to use it."
the quay hotel spa deganwy,positive,"Good parking facilities. There is a lot as disabled parking spaces around the hotel. I am not sure if there is public transport down to the hotel as I drove and the only thing that I would worry about if i hadn't is the train line that runs across the enternce of the Quay complex as I'm not sure my chair would have gone over it. There is accessible toilets around the hotel and in the spa area, there is also an accessible toilet in the building across the car park (i think it was for the marina) There are 2 spaces by the entrance. The rest of the car park is level Tarmac Brilliant and huge, very clean always fancy soaps , and that's in the toilets off reception."
the quay musselburgh,positive,"There is enough space to park. We have not used the car park as we were using the public trunsport, however it seemed like there is enough space. Spacious and clean."
the queens gallery   palace of holyroodhouse edinburgh,positive,"There are accessible parking spaces on the main road immediately outside the entrance to the ticket desk. Across the road at the bottom of the Royal Mile there is also a taxi rank. Lothian Bus number 35 regularly passes by the gallery with the stop a short walk away.  Sizeable. No red cord. On street blue badge parking is close by to the Gallery. Accessible buses pass nearby. Taxis can drop off almost at the door. An accessible toilet is available in the adjacent courtyard area. Buses go very close, lots of space to be dropped off and picked up by taxis or support. Only annoying point about toilets is that they are not based in the cafe or shop building, you have to go looking for them and go outside. It was suggested that better signposting and symbols would have been good"
the queens hall edinburgh,negative,"Lots of public transport available but if driving, it is better parking in the surrounding streets and walking as the venue is on a main road. Big enough but difficult to get in and out of, as it is on a main corrider. The Queen's Hall is easily accessed by Lothian Buses, but parking is not great in the surrounding area. It is within walking distance of the main university campus and about a 20 minute walk from Waverley Train Station. The accessible loo is a bit tired looking, see pic, needs upgrading but it does what t says on the tin?!"
the queens hall edinburgh,positive,"On main bus routes Good selection of public buses, 2, 3, 5, 8, 29, 30, 33, 49 but on street parking would be tricky. "
the queens head london,negative,"This pub is in a small side-street off the King's Road in Chelsea, with no step-free stations anywhere nearby, but plenty of bus routes going up and down the King's Road, all of them theoretically wheelchair-accessible."
the queens head london,positive,"The pub is located just off Gray's Inn Road, very near King's Cross Station, which is step-free to all lines. In addition there are zillions of buses serving the immediate area. So public transport is very favourable for getting to this pub."
the queens leeds,positive,There is direct access to the hotel through Leeds City train station. There is valet parking available but we do not know the costs of this. Taxi drop off is at the front of the hotel. 
the raeburn edinburgh,negative,"Does not have it’s own parking, we parked on the main road."
the raeburn edinburgh,positive,"When we phoned to book, the staff explained that they only have room to park 4 cars as there is on street parking round about. However, they reserved us one of the places on hearing we needed disabled access.  The disabled toilets are on the ground floor, easily accessible in my power chair, spotlessly clean and tidy with lots of space and grab rails. Lovely hand-wash! I deducted half a star simply because the paper towels were packed so tightly into the dispenser that each one tore as I tried to remove it. "
the railbridge bistro queensferry,negative,"Because it is far from town, it is inadvisable to go if you have no lift. There are disabled blue badge places in the shore front car park but people may have to park up the hill. Large, clean and functional - however not too easy to get to (as they are at the rear and behind a heavy door) They also double as baby changing facilities."
the railbridge bistro queensferry,positive,"There is a train station in South Queensferry  (Dalmenay), which is about a 10 minute walk from the Bistro. It is downhill going to the Bistro, but walking or pushing going back up the hill to the station might be harder!  We came by car, there is a large car park directly across the road from the Bistro, with several marked disabled bays."
the railway club carlisle,positive,"No allocated disabled bays, but plenty of parking available near doors. Very poorly lit though"
the railway tavern london,negative,"Apparently they have a disabled toilet, but seeing as it is on a different level. (I.e. down a short flight of stairs) to the wheelchair accessible entrance, I did not visit. It"
the ranald hotel oban,negative,"No designated parking, parking is in the one way street outside hotel. Parking is free between 1800hrs and 0900hrs, and free 24hrs if you display your blue badge. Drop down from pavement outside hotel . Railway station 5 minutes away, which has a taxi rank outside. Coaches drop off in same area. Note about parking in street,  parking is on right hand side of street, therefore limited door space from drivers side. Also means transferring from car to wheelchair in the street with cars passing close by, although most were considerate"
the ranald hotel oban,positive,"Accessible loo in entrance hall, excellent plenty of room to manoevere , grab rails in place, however assistance cord tied up and locked away in a cupboard. As mentioned access to bathroom in room was impossible without someone holding door open. Roomy wet room with plenty of room to manoever, sturdy foldable seat in shower area, only concern was no info on weight restriction of seat. Grab rails in place, but could have benefitted from a horizontal rail to right hand side of toilet to enable pushing up off toilet.coat hook half waŷ down door kept banging my companion in the back causing bruising, would perhaps be better placed to side of door. Only half of floor where shower situated seemed to be non slip surface, would be problematic if wet with crutches or sticks, causing a slip hazard Lovely quality toiletries provided in room and public areas"
the range falkirk,positive,There are accessible parking spaces outside the main entrance of the store. The nearest public transport is about a fifteen minute walk out of the central retail park. I spotted customer toilets on the ground floor in the right hand corner as you walk in the main entrance. The accessible toilet was clean and spacious.
the range huntington,negative,"This is where the 'bad' bit comes in. From the ground floor access is made to the loo upstairs via a lift. It tends to be mucky inside and out. The accessible female toilet is at the dear end of the ladies toilet - that's not a problem, personally, but despite the sink inside and soap (if it's a good day!) there is no hand-drying facility available."
the range huntington,positive,"Now that the disabled parking bays have been re-painted, parking is very easy for Blue Badge holders. There is a large parking space which has disable parking both at the entrance and exit points. The only disadvantage is that the nearest bus stop is at Monk Cross, Shopping Centre which is 15 - 20 minutes walk away from The Range. There are customer toilets both on the ground floor and 1st floor and can be easily found using the signs. The toilets were clean, spacious and had everything that you needed, for example grab rails and alarm system are installed. "
the range truro,negative,"There is some Blue Badge parking but only three spaces which were suitable for a long wheelbase WAV with a rear lift, which were all occupied. Our vehicle was too big for the other spaces so we ended up parking at the furthest point of the car park and parking over the space behind as well. We then had to navigate the busy car park. With a little more thought they could have installed a smaller version of a Changing Places toilet. My son was entirely unable to use this toilet."
the rare breeds centre woodchurch,negative,"A big let down. No unisex accessible toilets. Cubicles in the men's and women's (outside the restaurant) .  A large cubicle in the inside restaurant women's toilet but this was not clean and had wrongly placed support rails which made it unusable. I knew of another one on site in the events centre so had to ask staff to open it. This one is only in the men's toilet (a room within the men's urinal area). The door wouldn't close without taking off foot plates, no clear space under the sink, no sanitary or continence pad bins. They state no hoists on site.  Really poor."
the rare breeds centre woodchurch,positive,Several marked accessible bays near the entrance on a hard surface. 
the real food cafe tyndrum,positive,Good toilet My PA drove her and I to Tyndrum to meet Sarah and have fish and chips. Got parked right at door and went up the ramp to enter. Guy at door gave  us menus. Low down sink for washing boots and dogs and one for people to wash hands. Anti bacterial hand gels everywhere.
the red lion oxford,positive,"No parking at the venue but there are on road disabled bays on nearby Beaumont Street and New Inn Hall Street and you can park in resident's only bays in Oxford if you have a blue badge. There is one and it's big enough with handrails but you need to use a radar key, which they have behind the bar if you don't have one. I didn't check it this time but the lock was broken last  summer for some time."
the red lion winfrith newburgh,positive,Very large car-park with two disabled spaces few yards from entrance.  Bus stop nearby for occasional bus.
the refinery edinburgh,positive,"Good number of buses go to Saint Andrew Square and the tram stop is very close.  See photograph. There are Lothian busses stopping nearby in the square and on Princes Street, lots of taxis available in this part of town, and nearby parking in the square and on George Street. It's also close to Edinburgh Waverley Train Station."
the refreshment room carnforth,negative,"Toilets are big enough to move around in, no changing place facility but was good enough for our needs"
the refreshment room carnforth,positive,The bus stop is just outside of the entrance to the car park for the train station with a wide range of disabled spaces available in the car park as well. Regular buses and trains for the local area
the regal cambridge,negative,"There is street parking outside the club, but it is often unavailable."
the regal cambridge,positive,"There is an accessible toilet which can be opened by a radar key. The disabled toilet is a bit strange - you go through a lobby to it. I waited outside for quite a while before realising the door led to the lobby and not the main toilet! Bar staff have a radar key for it. Inside it's a little bit small, but nicely done and very clean."
the regency hotel solihull,negative,"Toilet needs maintenance work, not very big, has a grab rail.it’s clean enough but needs a coat of paint"
the regency hotel solihull,positive,"Easy to reach, lots of parking spaces, but very off putting appearance of the hotel"
the reliance leeds,negative,"The café is about a mile from the train station, & car parking nearby is limited. However, taxis drop clientele off directly outside the café, & there are several bus stops nearby. The pavements are in places uneven, with some of the kerbs being rather steep to get up & down, but there are proper crossings on the main road if not on the side streets. I didn’t use the toilets, but I did notice that the sign for them directed you through another manual door."
the renfield training conference centre glasgow,negative,There is limited on street parking.  Bath Street and Sauchiehall Street have a good bus service from the city center and the West End. Charing Cross train station is within walking distance but it is not accessible for wheelchairs. There is a car park on ElmBank Street.  They have an accessible toilet. It's fairly small but manageable.
the rex berkhamsted,negative,"Situated by the disabled access door, it seems to be used by everyone on the ground floor despite there being ladies and gents toilets upstairs. This means that it can get very busy at the end of the showing when everyone is leaving. "
the richmond st deli aberdeen,negative,There is a bus stop on Rosemount place a few meteres away from the deli. There is also one disabled parking space directly opposite the front door. There is on-street parking nearby also.
the richmond st deli aberdeen,positive,The accessible toilet was spacious and clean.
the ring london,negative,Southwark Station (Jubilee Line) is just over the road and is step-free.
the rings cupar,positive,"You can park right outside the door Plenty of room to turn chair to transfer to toilet or to roll commode chair over toilets Parking right at the doors with a very large car park  Each room had an ensuit and with showers or baths. One of the baths had a lift in it so anyone could get in and out easily  Car is essential to get to the Rings. Parking plentiful Large wet rooms ,plenty of space. Only 4 because the grab rails are the temporary ones currently but they were firm hold. Sliding doors go away completely so clear access into bathrooms. We were able to park right near the house, as we'd requested this on the booking, but otherwise, you can unload the car on arrival right by the house, and then move the car to a car park within the grounds. Very clean, spacious and well fitted out with grab rails, seat riser and sink with space underneath for legs. Able to park right by front door Fully wheelchair accessible, grab rails and toilet frames available Parked outside. Parking for rest of family. Very clean, plenty of room to manoeuvre. Shower fantastic. There is parking directly outside the door. The driveway is gravel, but it sits on a tray to stop it from moving or sinking when wheelchairs drive across.  There were toilets in each room - plenty of space for maneuvering a wheelchair, transferring to the toilet or using a portable hoist. Bathroom sinks were accessible and allowed A range of movable grab bars are available for use wherever needed such as the toilet or shower areas.   There is a main car park at the top of the property but level parking is provided outside each unit. This gives easy access to the room you've booked. Each room has a wet room with plenty of room. Hand rails and other aids are also available.  i drove in car. as mentioned in other posts parking is plentiful and adjacent to the accommodation. was glad of my sat nav to find the cottages in the dark. a real joy driving along the country lanes. can't comment. looked the part. Ample space to park at the house for several cars. The Rings is located less than 10 minutes out of Cupar and was very easy to find.  All bathrooms in the property were wetrooms and at least 3 of the 8 bathrooms were fully accessible (I didn't go into the other 5 but was led to believe they were accessible). Very clean and finished to a very high standard. Underfloor heating throughout  There was more than enough parking for everyone and a designated drop of zone as we had a disabled access van to drive the clients around in. Only small issue, probably not terribly fixable, but the hill down to the drop of zone is a wee bit steep if you're in a larger vehicle, so be careful!  Our clients didn't use the toilets however, as far as I could see they were very accessible. Large wet rooms, shower chairs provided, easy use taps and toilet flush. "
the rising sun london,negative,"The accessible toilet can be found towards the back of the pub & is radar key operated. There is a table in front of it which makes getting in awkward, & the lock was broken when I used it (although this may well be fixed now). The cubicle was small but clean."
the riverfront newport,positive,My husband and I parked in the car park opposite but there are spaces outside the theatre. You may have to contact the theatre regarding these. I didn't use it but there is no option on this form to say so.
the roald dahl museum and story centre great missenden,positive,"From London Marylebone Station it is about a 45 minute journey to Great Missenden. When travelling from London, when you exit the train there is a either a footbridge with no lift to cross or there is a step free slightly uphill path, which is signposted Way Out and with a wheelchair symbol, see photos. I used the step free path, it had continuous hand rails on both sides and it brought me out into the street. From here I turned right onto the pavement and walked down street which had a notable, but not too steep slope, see photo. At the bottom of the hill you turn right onto the High Street, which is flat, and it is the road where the Museum is located. If you require a drop kerb, keep walking along the road until you get to the Cross Keys pub, where there is a step free crossing. The Museum is only 3 - 5 minutes walk from the station and is well sign-posted.  On the way back there is no need to cross the bridge to get on the platform for trains towards London. There are 2 accessible toilets. One by the entrance in the courtyard and one between the Solo and The Story Centre galleries.  Both are spacious and clean. They have automatic lights, grab rails and emergency cords, which reached towards the ground. "
the robert burns birthplace museum alloway,negative,I can only give three stars for the accessible toilets. There was an accessible toilet in the main visitor centre but unfortunately this was out of action. I had to go to the Burns cottage and the adjacent education centre to use the other accessible toilet. This did distract somewhat from my enjoyment of the experience of visiting.
the robert burns birthplace museum alloway,positive,We arrived by car and visited the visitor centre first. Some handy blue badge parking spaces were very close to the main entrance. We discovered that you could drive to the Burns cottage and also park in handy accessible spaces by the entrance. Has its own private car park directly outside with a good amount of accessible spaces. Unsure about getting there via public transport. Are a good size in the museum. There  is also an accessible toilet at the cottage area.
the robert ransome pub ipswich,negative,"The door is a good weight, however the internal lock is placed too high for most wheelchair users to reach, especially for those who cannot raise their arms much, as in my case. The lock position meant that my boyfriend had to wait outside to make sure noone intruded."
the rocks dunbar,positive,"Plenty of parking outside when we arrived for lunch on a Wednesday. Probably not as easy at the weekends or evenings. No designated Blue Badge parking. Toilets clean and tidy. Not huge, and unsuitable for large electric wheelchairs."
the roman baths bath,positive,We parked in a disabled space close to the Roman Baths
the roost bridlington,positive,"No problem for wheel-users but someone with difficulty walking might need to have a rest between car and door, but there is a table and chairs there. There is a double bedroom with an ensuite bathroom which has a shower over the bath and the other room can be configured as a twin or a king-size double and the ensuite bathroom is a wet room with just enough space to manoeuvre a wheelchair.  The loo in the wetroom was very high. Grab rails by sink, loo and shower. No shower seat but they provide one if you ask. There are 360 degree views of all the rooms on the website so you can get a really good idea of what you're getting."
the rose crown romaldkirk,negative,We'd driven. There is a bus but no idea where it came from or went to. No disabled parking at the front of the building or in the rear car park.   The car park is covered in deep shingle making it hard to walk on or wheel a chair on. The loo in our room had a single waist height grab rail - great when going in but too high to be of help when standing up again. There was a nearby stool though which came in useful! There was a red alarm cord (tied up but I dare say I could have had it lowered if I'd asked). No accessible loo evident in the main building which I dare say is down to this being such an old building.  Just worth bearing in mind if you were thinking of visiting just for the bar or restaurant.
the rose of hungerford hungerford,negative,There was free blue badge parking with accessible loo in the car park which was about 1/4 mile away.  
the rosemary restaurant stanton fitzwarren,positive,"There are disabled parking spaces, but they are up quite a steep slope, which is easy enough to do if one is mobile, but otherwise may require a helping hand. Perfect toilet.  Good size with everything at the correct height.  Nice toiletries and a good size mirror too."
the rosslea hall hotel restaurant rhu,positive,"Disabled parking places at front door Toilets to left of front door, handrails and bars in place."
the rotunda glasgow,positive,There is plenty of disabled parking available in the car park but no dropped kerb to access the venue itself 
the royal arch dundee,positive,"There are council car parks/on street parking close by and taxi rank is also nearby. There are also plenty of buses that pass through Broughty Ferry on regular basis. A train station is also situated in Broughty Ferry although I don’t know anything about how often they stop, I know it’s not that much though."
the royal burgess golfing society of edinburgh edinburgh,positive,"As above, but I think only one disabled space. This does not matter as the car park is big and flat."
the royal hotel waterloo,positive,"Easy assess from car park outside. Has a disabled room on ground floor with parking right outside for an overnight stay. Clean, well arranged disabled toilet."
the royal mews   buckingham palace london,negative,there is lots of buses passing by so it has a good bus service stopping nearby.
the royal mews   buckingham palace london,positive,there is a decent sized accessible toilet. It's not far from Green Park station - which is wheelchair accessible.  Very clean and tidy - could have done with the Red Cord hanging correctly to the floor though.
the royal mint experience llantrisant,positive,Plenty disabled parking near entrance ramp.  Clean purpose built modern. Easy to find. 
the royal oak cerne abbas,positive,No problems with parking 
the royal oak fritham,negative,"Not sure if the bus comes here. We drove and got there early as parking is a bit tight. There are no Blue badge spaces. Once spaces outside the pub are gone, it's on street parking."
the royal society london,positive,"I travelled by public transport. The nearest tube is Piccadilly Circus or Charing Cross, which both have poor disabled access. There are many buses that stop near by, in Piccadilly or Trafalgar Square, and then it is a few minutes walk. I travelled to Trafalgar Square on the bus and then it was a flat 5 - 10 minute walk to the Royal Society, and I think this may be the best option for people with mobility difficulties, as Piccadilly is up/ down a hill. The disabled access toilet is on the ground floor just behind reception, through a door which has a sign saying members only area. Due to it's location the person with a disability would have to ask a member of staff to gain access to the toilet. The toilet has grab rails, reasonably spacious and well maintained. The main toilets are in the basement and accessible by lift, but I didn't use these."
the royal yacht britannia edinburgh,negative,I did not see a disabled toilet but wasn't looking for one as I used one in the center before going on board. I would surgest looking at their website or calling to get any questions answered. 
the royal yacht britannia edinburgh,positive,"I parked in multi-story car park attached to the Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre where the Royal Yacht Britannia is located. We parked on level E which was recommend because that is the level you enter the Royal Yacht Britannia box office on. There was plenty of accessible parking on this level of the multi-story car park however, it was very dark when driving around and difficult to see the parking spaces. I noticed later on that the lights are environmentally friendly lights that go on when you get near them which is good but, I feel it was quite dangerous, especially walking/driving out with the car with other cars driving around.  Due to not being from this area I don’t know anything about where or what public transport is available but, there is plenty of information available on the Royal Yacht Britannia website. There was an accessible toilet on every level of the Royal Yacht Britannia which I was extremely surprised about, especially the size of them. Within the tea room that accessible toilet is very tight to move around in. I struggled to turn around and I can imagine it would be difficult for someone to transfer out of their wheelchair, especially if someone is assisting them. There is a fire evacuation chair in the Tea Room toilet that takes up some of the room, I don’t know if this is able to be moved someplace else?  All other accessible toilets were surprisingly very spacious on the Royal Yacht Britannia. The only thing I noticed was that one of the accessible toilets, I think it was on level 1 of the yacht, the floor was a little uneven. I felt weird driving on it, I don’t know if it’s because you’re lower down and closer to the water as well but, I think it would be a little difficult to transfer from your wheelchair. This can’t be helped though because it is an old yacht, I was just extremely surprised how many accessible toilets there were. I wasn’t able to look at the accessible toilet in the ticket office/museum are before you go on to the yacht but, I can imagine it would be similar to the other ones. I put up Euan’s Guide emergency red cord cards in as many of the accessible toilets that I could however unfortunately I ran out of them during my visit.  There is no Changing Places toilet at the Royal Yacht Britannia or Ocean Terminal. The closest one is at Royston Wardieburn Community Centre which is a 13 minute drive and approximately a 53 minute walk away from the Royal Yacht Britannia. I used the number 22 Lothian Bus which takes you right outside Ocean Terminal. There was at least one accessible toilet on board. It was a bit tight  which is understandable. There were grab rails and an alarm. Disabled parking is part of the OceanTerminal shopping centre where Britaninia is located. There is some distance, around 200 m, between the parking and Britannia. It is all on the level if you park on the same level in the multi story car park. Surprisingly there is even an accessible toilet on board the yacht. The space and facilties were good with a raised toilet, grab rails and plenty of space to turn. I drove there and parked in the free parking for The Ocean Terminal Shopping Center. I used my wheelchair to get to the yacht. "
the rspb newport wetlands newport,positive,Free disabled parking.   Accessible Loo in centre/coffee shop.
the rule st andrews,negative,"Although there is on street parking, parking in Street Andrews is very limited.  The toilet was clean and roomy. "
the rumblin tum lochgilphead,negative,Public(radar key) disabled toilet right next to the car park. The toilet is kept ok but is a little run down. The Rumblin' Tum doesn't have a disabled toilet. 
the rumblin tum lochgilphead,positive,There's at least 4 disabled parking bays between the two car parks opposite the Rumblin' Tum cafe. The bus stop going both ways(towards Tarbert & the other heading towards Lochgilphead); heading towards Tarbert the bus stop is right infront of the car park and the other heading to Lochgilphead is almost opposite. I'm not sure on how often the buses run here as I did not use a bus to get there. 
the running horse maidstone,negative,"A few accessible parking bays, no hash area, sloping hard surface. A small amount of general parking across the road.  Spacious inside, larger than usual with babychange well out of the way. Full set of support bars in the right place. Slippy floor. The let down was that access via the corridor would have been impossible in a large power chair. No access front on to the door to open it. Diners can watch whilst you struggle to open the door. RADAR key needed."
the safari lounge edinburgh,negative,"Bus stop right outside the pub and plenty of buses go past.  Though walked here. One positive, they have toilets, on the same level. But, the men’s are really exposed, the urinal is basically beside the door and when the door is open everyone can see you pee as its beside a busy corridor where folk go between two rooms.  No accessible loo.   "
the salisbury arms edinburgh,positive,"Accessible parking spaces are right outside. You usually have to type in your car registration number on a tablet when you arrive. Not sure if they are currently using the same system (recently reopened post Covid-19 lockdown). Near to bus stops which are on the number 2, 14, 30 and 33 Lothian buse routes.  There are two disabled parking bay just outside the entrance. There is a disabled toilet on the ground level .  In order to access the toilets and you must use the  radar key scheme .  See photo .  It is wheelchair accessible and very spacious . See photo .  There is an emergency right cord Disabled parking space in front of building - perfect. Spacious toilet and easily accessible. The car park has 2 disabled bays with plenty of space to get in and out the car. The only issue is that the car park is locked until opening time, which can be difficult for people looking to arrive early for a meeting etc. The accessible loo was perfect for me and had everything I was looking for as a manual wheelchair user. Plenty of space to move in and around. The disabled access spaces in the car park, are no wider than the other spaces making the accessible spaces less accessible to some. "
the sandeman perth,negative,The accessible loo is fairly easy to find as it’s right near the woman’s and mans loo. 
the sandeman perth,positive,"There isn’t a car park as it’s on the street. There is on-street parking and a multi - storey car park near by which isn’t free for blue badge users. The accessible loo is easy to find as it’s right near the woman and men’s toilets.  I use buses to get around Perth which is handy for me as the pub is in the corner of where the buses drop off and pick up. There is also a car park in the same street across the road. Generally I get someone able-bodied or standing atleast to order the food but there is a shorter area at the end of the bar that you should be able to use to order where they can then see you. It can definitely get busy trying to order during football times. Their accessible loo needs a radar key. Generally in okay repair. Has grab rails and is Generally tidy. It's also a baby changing unit which does take up a fair amount of space when it's down. We didn't use transport but the venue is easily accessed by bus, taxi or car.  There is no private car park but is on street parking and a multi-storey close by.  The multi-storey is not free to blue badge holders.  There is a bus and taxi rank just around the corner from the venue.   There is an accessible toilet, but none of our group used it on this occasion.  All of the group had used it previously and said it was a good toilet.  "
the scotch whisky experience edinburgh,negative,"The venue is close to the Castle esplanade, there is limited on street parking in this area but there is some available on Johnston Terrace.   There are buses that drop you off at the Royal Mile or on North Bridge and then you can make your way up towards the experience. It's on the royal mile therefore there is no direct parking , however there are some disabled parking spots on the street behind the venue We arrived by tram and got off at Princes Street. We then made our way up The Mound and Ramsay Lane. This way is very steep and not the most easiest way to get to The Royal Mile. I believe an easier route would be to go along by Bank Street and Lawnmarket. I'm not sure which buses take you to this area. The attraction is located at the top of the Royal Mile with the nearest on-street parking about a ten minute walk away. The nearest buses stop on North Bridge just a little bit further down the Royal Mile. The main street is cobbled, however there are concrete pavements either side. I arrived having walked up from the Lawnmarket and the nearby bus stops. Nestled as it is below the castle and on the Royal Mile there isn't much scope for close proximity parking. That said vehicles can drop off at the door so an accessible taxi is an option. Maybe getting off one of the tour buses in the Lawnmarket would also work for some people. It's up near the Castle esplanade which means there aren't any direct bus links, with narrow pavements and cobbled roads up to the venue. You could get a taxi, but for affordability getting a bus as close as possible to North Bridge would be wisest. There are several buses in the surrounding area: 3, 5, 7, 8, 14, 35."
the scotch whisky experience edinburgh,positive,"The accessible toilet was on a lower floor - well signposted and easy to find - just take the lift down. It’s not the largest of loos but it was fine. The disabled toilet was easy to find & when our disabled friend took the wrong turning a member of staff was on hand to direct him. It was clean & tidy, with room for a career.  Well Signposted Accessible loo is on a lower floor which can be reached easily through the lift. The accessible loo is on the lower floor adjacent to the cafe / restaurant. A lift connects the floor and is of the deep and slim variety. The loo is clean, tidy and well lit. It has a Male space for most wheelchair users but may be a little tight for large power chairs.  There is ample parking around the Royal Mile, parked on Chambers Street next to the museum however this might not be practical if you have difficulty walking. The disabled toilet is fully accessible, however it is made smaller by very large sink. It is still usable by a wheelchair user. This The toilets are located on the bottom level which is accessible by stairs and lift. I loved how clean the accessible toilet was. The toilet has a fold-down grab bar on the right-side and the toilet roll holder was within easy reach. I l also loved the large roll-under sink because it was a good size and height. The only downside was the space within the bathroom. Once the door is closed it can be difficult to move your wheelchair around, especially if you have someone in helping you.   Since my last visit an additional accessible loo has been added on the lower floor. It is fabulous; with beautiful fittings, plenty of space, and I could turn completely around with my powerchair! We got there on the 35 bus which dropped us off a little bit further down the Royal Mile. Not sure where the nearest Blue Badge parking spaces are. Accessible toilets on the bottom two floors via the lift which is ample for wheelchair and powerchair users. The new accessible toilet on the bottom floor next to the function room is delightfully roomy and bright (kudos for the Red Cord Card attached!)"
the scotsman hotel edinburgh,negative,"The accessible toilet was well appointed and would be spacious. Due to its use as a baby changing facility and a portable changing bench block access it was not accessible to me. There is an accessible toilet by the conference area and grand staircase. Unfortunately, it is blocked by a portable baby changing unit. Transport for me was pretty good with bus stops only a short distance away on the North Bridge. It's also fairly handy for the station. The accessible toilet in the conference meeting room area needs some attention. There was a large wooden baby changing unit immediately in the entrance area that prevented my turning and getting in. I had to ask for it to be removed. The beautiful, white, hand towels were on a shelf out of reach for me as a wheelchair user - another wet hands day."
the scotsman hotel edinburgh,positive,The hotel is well placed for public transport with bus stops on the North Bridge. There is also another entrance to the hotel which goes out on to Market Street opposite the railway station.
the scottish cafe restaurant edinburgh,positive,"Buses run  along nearby Princes Street. If coming by car there is some dedicated accessible parking on the Mound by the galleries. Alternatively; you can come on the tram or train which are both handy although it is a good five minute walk away. The restaurant has is own dedicated accessible loo which was great. Large, spacious and clean."
the scottish deer centre cupar,negative,There is a disabled toilet but it could do with upgrading. There is a loo but it is very dated and wouldn't fit most power chairs.  The door is a slide door that doesn’t offer much privacy and there is no mirror.  Getting into the toilet involves some tight manoeuvres. 
the scottish deer centre cupar,positive,There is a carpark with disabled bays close to the entrance. I've been to this attraction many times and never had a problem finding a disabled bay. There is an accessible toilet close to the entrance before entering the area with the animals. The toilet has a sliding door and although it's not a very large toilet there was still space for my wheelchair and carer.  There are 3 blue badge spaces in the middle parking bay. There is a path towards the courtyard which has a fairly steep gradient but is suitable for wheelchairs.
the scottish fisheries museum anstruther,negative,"There's an accessible loo to the right of the shop as you go in. Its quite small but works for smaller wheelchairs. Museum doesn't appear to have own parking and you have to rely on public car parks or street parking. If you're lucky you can get a space in the carpark by the RNLI shop which is opposite the  Museum and then you don't have to walk or push too far. Blue badge parking in the public car park opposite is free but very limited. Disabled toilet in shop, down a bit of a slope which may be steep coming back out."
the scottish fisheries museum anstruther,positive,"The best way to get to Anstruther is by car or bus. The nearest train station is at Leuchars. Stagecoach provides the local bus service - routes X60 and 95 - https://www.stagecoachbus.com/timetables. There is also a Moffat and Williamson Flexibus - www.go-flexi.org or telephone 01382 540624.  The nearest bus stop is directly outside the museum. The stop on the opposite side of the road to the museum has a bench and shelter.   There is a public car park across the road from the museum, with 2 designated disabled spaces. There is a public car park at the harbour with additional designated disabled spaces.. Both are free for blue badge holders. We parked at the car park at the harbour and walked the short distance to the museum.  "
the scottish parliament edinburgh,negative,For us this was very simple with good bus access to The Parliament from town.  We only had to go on one bus from the Milton Road Campus and then a short walk down from Abbeyhill. No public parking facilities but there is a car park at Arthur's Seat that is close by.
the scottish parliament edinburgh,positive,"Taxi dropped me off at the entrance of the building so no parking issues to speak of. Toilets were we'll sign posted, in good condition and very spacious. There are a few accessible parking bays outside. Bus 35 and other tourist buses pass frequently. People who use a blue badge can park on single yellow lines in Edinburgh with no limit I used the Changing Places toilet which was fantastic. Staff are nearby if you need help opening doors. Toilets are near the gift shop on the bottom floor. Parking in arrival was fairly easy as there are accessible parking bays opposite the entrance. They're a in a dedicated lay by and it can get quite busy at times. If you are using public transport there are several bus services that pass close by. The toilets were excellent. With several accessible toilets throughout the building and a Changing Places toilet adjacent to the shop. The toilets were spacious, well appointed and spotlessly clean. Great to see them all sporting a Euan's Guide Red Cord Card as well! Allocated bays opposite the parliament entrance. Excellent. The toilet used had various sized slings, hoist and a changing /washing area. Disabled parking across from Parliament building.  Disabled parking bays are available immediately opposite the main entrance on the far side of the road. If you are coming to an event by invitation you may be able to make arrangements for close proximity parking if you speak to the event organiser. Some of the best accessible toilets in town! There are several accessible toilets all with differing permutations of layout. All the features you would expect and spotlessly clean. A Changing Places toilet is also available; just ask a member of staff for directions. I travelled to the Scottish Parliament from a meeting in the city centre. The number 35 bus stops right across from the Parliament entrance.  There are several disabled parking bays immediately opposite the Parliament entrance for Blue Badge holders.  If you're walking from the city centre it's a down hill stroll along the Royal Mile. Going down's fine but a bit of a push up if you're walking - a handy bus stop outside the Parliament and on the foot of the Royal Mile has accessible buses stopping there that will take you up the hill. Full marks for the accessible toilets. The Parliament has several and these are of different layouts and sizes. The one I used was fine and had enough space to turn my powerchair.  There is also a Changing Places toilets available, a notice by the accessible loo gave further information. There is transport and parking at the door but across the road the station is about15. Minutes away Signage could be better  Taxi, the 35 bus or parking in the row of accessible parking at the front of the building. Toilets throughout the building, including a changing places toilet on the ground floor."
the scran scallie edinburgh,positive,"We went by car, we were able to park right outside."
the scrib tree douglas,positive,One Disabled Space One disabled toilet . Clean and roomy with a feature of indvidual towels
the seafood ristorante st andrews,negative,"Car park free for blue badge holders BUT is some distance away and to reach the restaurant you have to go up a steep incline almost too steep for my wife. There is a longer route that is more gradual, but no good on a rainy day."
the seafood ristorante st andrews,positive,"Nice, clean, roomy toilet "
the seahorse shalford,positive,"Although buses pass down the main road, not sure how close by they stop. We drove - there are two disabled spaces in the car park.  The main car park gets busy - there is an overflow car park but it's at the top of a steep slope. There's a great accessible loo to the rear. Sadly it's not signposted - I've been here before and didn't know it was there!  Has all necessary grab rails and alarm cord. Clean."
the secret garden cafe weymouth,negative,Car parks nearby are private so very expensive - no price reduction for blue badge holders. Side roads are generally unsuitable for parking so ended up parking quite a distance away near the Bowls club.  Hard to navigate as not many drop kerbs & lots of cobbled/unkempt paths.
the secret garden cafe weymouth,positive,"Loo was accessible & quite large. Not much of a transfer area so had to do a forward transfer. There were rails & red emergency pull cord, however, this was tied up in a big knot (I left a card). Low sink. Peddle bin for the hand towels.  It is currently still being worked on so this could change."
the shard london,positive,"I have to give this 5 stars for the view alone!!  There are toilets at entrance level.  However, I recommend visiting the toilets on floor 68, as these are known as 'the loo with a view'  There are a row of standard toilets, each of which has floor to ceiling windows giving amazing views over London. (There is an electronic blind you can put down if you are feeling shy).  I was really pleased to find there is an accessible toilet at the end of this row, also giving the views. It also is done in the same style as all the other toilets.  The hallway to get to the toilet is fairly narrow, particularly if other people are standing waiting- again might be a problem for a bigger chair/scooter.  We walked there but got public transport back. It's at an accessible tube station (London Bridge) but the lift was out of action. Staff quickly showed us where to get an accessible bus though. "
the shenaz   indian restaurant glasgow,negative,A few accessible parking spots at Mitchell theatre across road and some street parking. No accessible toilets.
the sherlock holmes museum london,positive,"The nearest tube stations are Baker Street and Marylebone, neither of which offer step free access. However, there are several buses that stop nearby. I would suggest travelling to King's Cross, Victoria or Paddington and then taking a bus to the museum."
the ship inn irvine,positive,"Tons of free parking, disabled spaces but also plenty of reasonably sized spac es that are long enough to use a hoist without standing in the road. Dropped kerbs are properly low too"
the ship inn stonehaven,negative,Although no direct disabled parking outside there are plenty of spaces around the location. A few minutes walk away is free parking car park with 2 dedicated spaces.
the ship inn stonehaven,positive,"Share baby changing facilities, however the loo is a very good size with good facilities."
the shore clinic edinburgh,positive,"Taxi drop-off right outside. On the level but off one of the two rooms, so make sure you're booked into 'the room with the loo' (sorry!). "
the shrewsbury coffeehouse shrewsbury,negative,"Unfortunately due to the size and layout of the building their toilets are downstairs, this personally doesn’t present a problem as I don’t often need an accessible toilet "
the sill bardon mill,positive,Clearly marked bays near entrance.  Accessible loo on each floor. Changing places space with shower and hoist and changing table. Detailed descriptions on website.
the sill national landscape discovery centre hexham,positive,There is a full changing places size toilet available with height adjustable shower stretcher/changing bench as well as shower and toilet. There are also additional disabled toilet facilities - the place is new. clean and well organised
the sipping room london,positive,We took the tube - Canary Wharf is fully accessible. Very big disabled toilet 
the slanj arrochar,positive,"There is a large flat tarmac car park. Although there are no designated blue badge spaces it is easy to drop someone off at the door. The toilet has a drop down rail and a grab rail on the other side that is near enough to be useful (not always the case!) There is room for a rollator and an assistant. I think there would also be room for a wheelchair and assistant. I don't recall seeing a red cord. The toilet is down a short corridor from the restaurant with a right angle turn, but fairly easy to get to."
the slug lettuce edinburgh,negative,"The accessible toilet was nearby to where we were sitting. It's not the largest and could be a problem if you have a large wheelchair or need assistance from a carer. It has a RADAR style lock to the door although it was kept open. It was let down by the lack of a bar to help you close the door. Once inside you are dependent on someone else pushing the door closed. If you are using a toilet witha carer also present, this toilet is very small, there was barely room for my chair and the two of us to actually maneuver ourselves into the right position.  The toilet was also extraordinarily high,  making it problematic to use. It is a radar key toilet, but it seemed to always be open, perhaps because it doubles as baby changing."
the slug lettuce edinburgh,positive,You can park in the underground car park and come up in the lift. There's also a bus stop about 50m up from the centre. Omni is close to the tram stop in York Place and is around 500m distant. It is very accessible by bus and there is the Greenside car park which is very suitable for mobility vehicle.
the slug lettuce york,positive,"There is a good sized disabled toilet, which is located close to one of the entrances and near the bar. There is enough space to manouvre a wheelchair. The key to access the toilet must be requested from the bar to use this, which could be difficult at busier times as one has to rely on a member of staff being available to leave the bar to unlock the toilet."
the smiddy inn cumbernauld,negative,"Wide spaces but not, blue badge user friendly "
the smiddy inn cumbernauld,positive,"Probably the best the reviewer has encountered in a pub/ restaurant setting. Uses radar key, available on request "
the snowy owl cramlington,positive,Parking bays outside main entrance. Car park level with good surface.  Not a huge number of disabled bays but plenty of other spaces. Not sure about buses but assume car needed to get here due to location. Great - only loses a star due to door to negotiate on the way and alarm cord far too short to be of use to someone on the floor. There would be room to put a wheelchair alongside the loo if the waste bin were moved.
the society room glasgow,negative,"The venue is in the middle of town so there are many transport options. Bus, train, car, taxi or subway! However there are little to no parking spaces outside the venue. If you are lucky enough to find a space close by you may have to cross the many busy roads. The closest train stations are Glasgow Central which is a six minute walk, Glasgow Queen Street five minute walk and a short six minute walk from Buchanan Bus station. Overall okay to travel too."
the society room glasgow,positive,"Women’s, Men’s and disabled toilets all easy accessed but no easy to spot. Women’s and Men’s toilets are down stairs but all bathrooms spacious with plenty room to move around. Grab rails in toilets with small area for carer or friend."
the southern edinburgh,positive,Lots of space to manouevre.
the spanish butcher glasgow,negative,although meter parking close by it is occupied.  we parked St Enoch's which is close by and accessible    approx 300 yards away 
the spanish butcher glasgow,positive,The toilets were very roomy and ample room for wheelchair with appropriate handrails   The access was via a door at the back of the restaurant which although I found difficulty with opening the door from restaurant.  Staff were very quick to see my challenge and offer assistance
the sportsmans rest llanbedr y fro,positive,Large carpark on an incline with disabled spaces at the very front. Disabled toilet on site access a little bit tight but  possible
the spotty bag shop banff,negative,Did the job. No red cord or space to turn around so had to rev reverse out. Bin in the way of transferring.
the spotty bag shop banff,positive,There are a few parking spaces outside and a large carpark about a minute's walk away. No blue badge spaces but lots of space.
the sse arena wembley,negative,"Parking was plentiful, but was chargeable at £35.  Not really acceptable when public transport connections for passengers in wheelchairs is not great."
the sse arena wembley,positive,Fantastic toilet facilities.  Clean and roomy with multiple stalls.  There was a stall for adult changing and a sink in each stall.
the sse hydro glasgow,negative,"I walked but the nearest car park was extremely busy and the traffic was really bad.  Why oh why can't there be some Blue Badge parking nearer the front door? There is lots of space. We were lucky in that there were a group of us so we got dropped off at the entrance and one of us then went to park the car. I'm not sure what the public transport links are like nearby but there are lots of venues in the area so would imagine it's pretty good. Plenty parking in nearby multistorey but walkway to Hydro is a bit of a walk, lift then walk. All exposed to elements. Cost £8 which I expected. Would be better if had blue badge parking directly outside but doesnt. Took 30 mins to get car out of multistorey due to high volume of cars leaving. Although there was signage they were still difficult to locate. Not as many accessible toilets as expected. You will need radar key or help unlocking from staff. I am able to use regular toilets. Bit inconvienient that ladies are only at each end..plenty of mens toilets scattered throughout venue Disappointed to have to move a chair out of the way  that was blocking the doorway to the accessible loo I visited. The toilet was accessed using a RADAR key. It was not particualrly spacious and could be difficult if you had a carer. It wasn't the cleanest of loos I'd seen either. I was dropped off in a car at the front door. I believe this is also where taxis can come too and public transport. I did have to roll on the road to get onto a kerb so more drop-kerbs would be preferred. If you’re coming to park there is a parking garage almost next door which charges. CG 2014 venues have no on-site parking. However for general use distance is perhaps challenging. Huge distance from the car park to the venue. Walkway doesn't go directly into the Hydro but requires circumnavigation of outside of building. Radar key required but staff on hand and very helpful. Doors are heavy and difficult to manage independently."
the sse hydro glasgow,positive,"I've never parked in the multi storey parking so can't comment on the venues parking. I always park on Minerva St/Minerva Way near the exhibition centre train station and walk through the tunnel.  There are accessible toilets on ground level and Level 2. There is also a changing places toilet in the West lobby of Level 2. All accessible toilets are operated by a radar key, which can be issued by a steward or purchased from the Information Desk if you don’t have your own.   Generally the toilets are good, but when I went to use one it had a lot of rubbish lying about.  Car Park across the road, covered walkway to venue and lifts to get to ground floor. Accessible toilet a good size for wheelchair and carer, entrance to toilet with radar key, staff on hand if you don't have one. Toilet very clean. Pretty easy to find as signs are around and if you can’t see the signs, there are lots of staff walking around that you could ask.  Parking in nearby car park Spacious. Very Close to the venue, brilliant Clinically clean and very easy to access Blue Badge parking is available in the adjacent car park. Vehicles can drop off out side the main door. There's also an accessible bus service that runs into town. The Exhibition railway station is a short distance away if travelling by train. I used the accessible toilet which is at the top of the ramp to 056. It was big enough for myself and a carer. RADAR key is required to get in - every staff member has one on their belt. The red cord touches the floor and handrails are on both sides. The multi-storey car park has several disabled parking bays on the second level.  It is £8 to use the car parking facility for disabled parking swell as normal parking. To get to the disabled toilet, you need to ask the steward who opens the door for you. When you're in the toilet, it is very spacious and I could easily turn my mobility scooter!  There is parking at the venue though this costs £10, if you can, you can find on street parking. Spacious accessible toilets using the Radar key.  If you’re in the lower half there is a toilet very close to the platform which is great, and its not too far upstairs. There are a lot of accessible toilets and there are changing places toilets on both levels. All toilets are clean and accessed by radar key, they are all big and modern."
the stables wavendon,positive,Brilliant. Right outside and a very short distance to get inside. Multiples and easy to get at and use.
the stag and hounds binfield,negative,"There is a car park, but no Blue Badge parking, however it is possible to drop passengers close to either the front or rear entrance. On a bus route, but very irregular service. No disabled toilets"
the stand edinburgh,negative,"As it's in the centre of Edinburgh there's not much parking. My partner and I took the bus and we had a fair 10 minute walk from the bus stop up a hill which you expect when in Edinburgh. Our bus stop was on Princes Street and there are lots of buses that take you there and the tram can also get you fairly close by. Did not visit the bathroom and could not see any signs for an accessible bathroom. Due to venue being packed, I couldn't have gotten to it if there was one anyway"
the stand glasgow,positive,Fully accessible loo on the main level.
the star inn the harbour whitby,positive,"No private parking but there is a large car Park opposite and behind the Star. With local knowledge there are 3 disabled parking areas close by, on the main road through town, but not that easy to find as a visitor. My suggestion is to stop immediately outside to drop off a mobility impaired person. Once inside the loo is good with left side transfer, low basin, support rails etc. It's location is not ideal as it is through the Ice Cream shop (same business ) which may be crowded at times. No signage within the restaurant or reception area."
the state rooms   buckingham palace london,positive,"We walked and bussed home - very accessible - but it seemed you could also apply for a parking space.  More than one loo and they were offered when we were near to one. All a good size.  Parked inside the Palace grounds - telephone in advance. Or you can wheel from Victoria or take a taxi There is a large accessible toilet which you can access on arrival. Large and the toilet flush is also easy to reach. If you had a car you can actually park it in the Palace grounds - 'the safest car parking in London' as one member of staff said.  There is a specific loo which all members of the access group are offered. It is large and has everything you need, and more. Very private and comfortable. N/A came in on train Easy to use"
the station station yard,positive,"If driving, the disabled parking is great and positioned right by the entrance. I'm not sure about public transport but the buses have a good reputation in Richmond and there's a swimming pool next door so I would assume buses stop there."
the steading edinburgh,negative,Large car park but only 1 disabled space Medium sized car park with enough room for a short stay.  Venue is also near a bus terminus.  No 'special' disabled parking. Large and accessible enough but the fist set were locked and it was a treck to the other ones.
the steam wheeler glasgow,negative,There were not many disabled spaces but did manage to get one. They were near restaurant. 
the steel cauldron sheffield,positive,The toilets had easy access and were clean. If you have a very large power chair you may not have room.
the stirling arcade stirling,positive,There is on street parking and a multi-storey at the nearby Stirling Shopping Centre. The train station and bus station are also close by.
the stirrup inn willoughton,negative,"The car park is small and unmarked so there is no designated disabled parking as such. The toilets are small, in the Female toilets there are two toilet cubicles, one bigger than the other however no grab rails. "
the stone trough inn york,negative,"Not on a bus route, a large sloping carpark with no Blue Badge space"
the storehouse restaurant with rooms kirkwall,positive,"No bays, but hosts will accommodate you so you can park in front of hotel door. Great accessible toilet on ground floor, and accessible room.  Good space to manoeuvre Very clean.  Definitely space for carer."
the storey   printroom cafe bar lancaster,negative,"5 mins from the Railway Station, Blue Badge Parking in St Nicholas Gate Shopping centre multi story car park 10 mins away"
the storey   printroom cafe bar lancaster,positive,"Two modern Radar Key Operated Wheelchair accessible toilets, well kept and very clean!"
the strand london,positive,It's not possible to park as it is a main road. There are frequent accessible buses passing along the street and Charing Cross is a nearby railway station.
the studio edinburgh,positive,It was tricky to find on our first visit but getting there is easy.... if you know how!! My pals parked in the accessible parking at the Festival Theatre. You then exit the car park the opposite way - so away from the main Festival Theatre. There is also a bus stop right outside.
the sun hotel hitchin,positive,cant actually remember if the was D/P but parking was close enough to our room
the sun inn newbattle,negative,Big parking space level with the pub but the Tarmac surface is really bad.  Thus ensuring a really hard job for whoever is pushing the chair and an uncomfortable ride for whoever is in the chair. Cramped
the sun inn newbattle,positive,As above
the sun inn swindon,negative,"There was a well signposted loo near the bar.  It was reasonable clean and spacious. It had grab rails by the loo.  But no alarm cord, plus paper towels were not anywhere near the washbasin. Major issues for me were (i) I had to get through a door so heavy, I couldn't manage to get it open even with my full weight against it (ii) no bar on the door to enable me to close it once inside (iii) tiny bolt which was all I had to hold to close the door and too small for me to hold .  After the heavy door, there was a sharp left turn, and the baby changing station on the wall - broken and in the way."
the sun inn swindon,positive,"Four disabled spaces right outside the entrance.  Nice gentle ramp to the entrance, with excellent clear sign pointing the way for disabled patrons. Can't comment on public transport, hence not given five stars."
the supreme court of the united kingdom london,positive,"Westminster Station is on the other side of Parliament Square and is fully step-free. Several bus routes serve nearby Whitehall and Parliament Square. There are many accessible toilets, both the ones I used were spacious, well-designed, well laid-out, and 100% fit for purpose."
the swan dumfries,positive,"We drove, street parking and private car park across the road available. The surface in the car park is a bit uneven. Easy to find , unexpected ‘dip’ when entering toilet, which caused chair to jolt. Clean & tidy , roomy, plenty of grabrails in place. Red assistance cord in place,  Was difficult to shut the door behind me , my companion had to come and close it for me "
the swan inn kidderminster,positive,I drove here. I don't know what the usual parking facilities are like because there was an event on so the arrangements were different from normal. The pub did have some parking but I don't know if they had wide spaces. Public transport looks to be infrequent to the village but I don't know for sure.
the swan ramsey,negative,"There is no parking area designated to The Swan, however there are parking facilities across the road in Parliament Square. The nearest disabled parking bay is located nearby to this at the entrance to Parliament Street. There are also disabled parking facilities a short (3 minute) walk away in Shoprite car park. The walk from both of these car parks has lowered kerbs and pelican crossings with audio prompts when crossing roads."
the swan ramsey,positive,"The accessible toilet in The Swan is well kept and has grab rails, an alarm cord and sufficient space. However it is difficult to locate as there is no sign on the door."
the swift at carrickfergus harbour carrickfergus,positive,"large public free car park beside the restaurant with 2 disabled spaces beside the restaurant and more at the castle end of the car park reasonably sized disabled toilet, well appointed but through a heavy fire door"
the symphony hall birmingham,negative,"I drove to the venue and am very lucky to have won a draw that they have to distribute the limited disabled parking places they have on site. On the public parking, there are about 7/8 on road disabled spaces, and a similar number in the Cambridge Road multi story car park. This car park is ok but the parking is on a slope making transfers a bit tricky and there is a gap between the car park paving and the main pavement which is just right for dropping a wheel down. From Multi story to venue is ok . Have parked across town a bit at the Mailbox and caught a taxi there and back..Venue is served by buses that go along Broad Street. There is considerable disruption as there are major building projects on going.  "
the symphony hall birmingham,positive,Pre book your parking space with the box office. Space was right next to main entrance No changing table for those that would need one Presume this is good There are several loos around the site - need radar key or ask for help. Very clean and good quality.
the tack room bromyard,positive,Parking at the facility is great. No public transport.
the talbot hotel malton,positive,"There is disabled parking close to the main entrance. At the time of our stay it was fully occupied, however the manager was very helpful in ensuring we could park close to the door There is a good accessible loo in the main lobby, and the disabled bedroom had very good disabled facilities - grab rails, shower seats etc - all very clean and well maintained"
the tall chimney swadlincote,negative,Average. Not very clean
the tall ship at riverside glasgow,negative,The ship does have an accessible toilet but not having used it I can't comment further. The accessible loo is accessed via the lift and is fine except that the door lock didn't work. I reported that and am confident that it will be fixed asap.
the tall ship at riverside glasgow,positive,"There are lots of disabled parking spaces available at the front of the riverside museum. The nearest accessible toilets are with the riverside museum which have handrails but no changing places toilets  I visited via the Hop On Hop Off bus but plenty of parking if you go by car.  For the age of the vessel they have done a great job with the toilet. Just basics of accessible toilet but well done.  We came by train from Partick station, which is about 10 minutes walk but a nice walk. If you arrive by car, there is a drop-off point. I don't know about disabled parking. The 100 bus stops very close by. The Tall Ship is located by the Riverside Transport Museum. There is a large car park with Blue Badge parking spaces. There is a bus service to Glasgow City Centre. Decent size accessible loo - clean and tidy. Has a Red Cord but this was tied up - otherwise would be 5*!"
the tank museum weymouth,negative,A variation as some are good and others not so but all work.
the tank museum weymouth,positive,"There was a large car park right outside the entrance.  But I cannot remember if special disabled spaces were available, sorry. Know there is a disabled toilet as I visited it, but I hadn't got the idea of what to look for yet.  Although saying that, they must of been grab rails, for me!! Parking outside and all surfaces are smooth and bump free. Plenty of Blue Badge spaces and flat road access into the museum. Not covered so you might get wet if it's raining! Toilets again very good, plenty big enough to transfer."
the tattersalls brasserie worcestershire,negative,"Altho' the hotel has a car park this is primarily for residents, restaurant guests are permitted to use it if there is space. (We visited twice & were able to use the carpark on both occassions.) There is limited road parking nearby, however the road immediately outside the hotel & adjoining side street has double yellow lines.  There is a carpark not too far away with daytime access to the hotel by a small shopping arcade - but access via the arcade is closed in the evenings.  Unfortunately a good restaurant spoiled by parking."
the tattersalls brasserie worcestershire,positive,"A good disabled toilet, however it is a bit of a twisty walk from the restaurant, with some uneven flooring."
the tea room at victoria park manchester,positive,There were changing place toilets 
the telford path and the ferry road path edinburgh,negative,"There are accessible toilets in some of the shops at Craigleith Retail Park, but none that we found elsewhere on the route."
the telford path and the ferry road path edinburgh,positive,Can't comment on the parking other than to say that there is shopper's parking at Craigleith Retail Park at the southern end of the Telford Path. Good Lothian bus connections to there and from near to the various exit points on the path described below.
the terenure inn dublin,positive,"Toilet is accessible but if you're in the restaurant section you have to go outside and into the bar, bit tight getting through all of the barstools to the toilet at the back"
the tetley leeds,negative,"Accessible toilets were signposted physically, and on floor signs."
the tetley leeds,positive,"The car park has plenty of disabled parking bays, and there are a few nearby bus stops and taxi drop off points."
the thai terrace guildford,positive,"The restaurant is located on the 7th floor over the car park. We parked in one of the blue badge spaces on the Sydenham Rd level (which I think is level four of the car park) . There were only a few blue badge  spaces but I don't know if there are any other spaces on other levels.  Of course the downside is having to pay as the spaces are inside the multi storey however after 6 on a Saturday it's only £1. The loos are sited adjacent to the main dining area, along a short passageway. There's a separate accessible loo - clearly signed with a wheelchair emblem. Staff also alerted us to its location when we were first seated. It was clean and reasonably well equipped (though the backrest had detached and needed re fixing) and would have got a better rating had it not had so much stuff stored in it! It would be impossible to align a wheelchair alongside the loo because of chairs stored in there. Otherwise good!"
the thekla bristol,negative,"There's a public car park with disabled spaces right next to the boat.  Unfortunately the quayside level is one step up and a couple of steps down from the car park, immediately outside the venue, although you can make it just one kerb-sized step down if you head right to the quayside a little further along - you may need to have a scout around."
the thistles shopping centre stirling,negative,blue badge parking largely reserved for shopmobility. No additional time or allowance made for blue badge holders. Very expensive. There is an accessible loo by primark store. perhaps we were just unlucky but it was pretty smelly and not very clean
the thistles shopping centre stirling,positive,"Local buses stop nearby, there is a car park, and the centre is a short distance from the railway station. The accessible toilets also double as baby changing areas. The are large, clean and well equipped. They can be busy at times. There is a car park at the rear and a shopping centre as close to both the train station and the bus station."
the thomas centre covenham saint bartholomew,positive,Plenty of parking onsite. Straightforward and room for wheelchair access.
the three bishops brighstone,negative,Not sure how close the bus gets though the pub is in the main part of Brighstone.  There are a few parking spaces at the front but the main car park is at the rear (behind that there's also a free public car park). There are no designated blue badge spaces that we could see. The main car park is pea shingle which is a nightmare to walk on with any sort of walking aid and my wheelchair had to be towed backwards by my carer. It was all a bit difficult really. Then there's a lengthy (but by comparison easy) push up the gently ramped patio to the entrance.
the three bishops brighstone,positive,"The loo was smart and well equipped. It was easily visible from the main bar area, with a clear sign on the door. The alarm cord was sadly part-tied up otherwise it would have been five stars. Plenty of room to turn a chair inside. Radar key operated but pub had their own key."
the three chimneys house over by dunvegan,positive,We got dropped off by a local taxi - they can get you pretty much to the door. There was a bit of gravel / uneven path just outside but we managed ok. No public transport nearby but that's pretty much the same with most of Skye. As with everything there it was a decent size and to a very high standard and needless to say clean and tidy.
the three chimneys house over by isle of skye,positive,Plenty of car parking space. Toilets were good with handrails & an emergency red cord. Clean with enough space to manoeuvre my wheelchair. 
the time capsule coatbridge,negative,Only 2 available although both are large and have showers available for personal use  
the time capsule coatbridge,positive,"There are many disabled spots lined up in front of the building, also with the pool being almost in the center of Coatbridge there are regular buses for those who cannot drive. "
the tobacco factory bristol,negative,"Parking on street outside or in the Aldi car park round the corner (beware charges). In the theatre there's just one unisex disabled toilet right next to the gents, no radar key and often used by blokes when there's a queue for the gents in the interval."
the tobacco factory bristol,positive,Street parking available. No the cleanest but roomy and fully operation.
the tony edge national centre wraysbury,positive,"The facility has got its own car park, so you can be assured ofa space. I wouldn't advise public transport as it is outside of town. I definitely go though - its worth the journey. There certainly was a disabled toilet/changing room - I changed in it. There must have been enough space therefore. As I said I discussed the hoist with staff so I'd be shocked if there wasn't one."
the tower of london london,positive,"The nearest tube station is Tower Hill which has a lift between street and platform. Step free bus numbers 15, 42, 78, 100 and RV1 all stop near to the Tower of London. There are public accessible toilets on Tower Hill, which are open 24 hours a day and operated using a RADAR key.  A Changing Places toilet is also be available at Petty Wales on Tower Hill on the event dates.  Tower Hill tube station is about a five minute walk away."
the travellers rest cardiff,negative,3 disabled spaces next to beer garden/entrance.  Spaces on sloping site so not so good for rear access. Standard disabled toilet with no changing area
the travellers rest cardiff,positive,Accessible loo available but not used on this visit. Disabled parking round the front.
the treehouse board game cafe sheffield,positive,"There are 3 disabled bays (free) to the side of the venue and a paid, covered, parking facility in the same location.  There is a single accessible toilet with no steps to negotiate. Grab rails well positioned and it was very clean and tidy. "
the treehouse cafe edinburgh,negative,Yellow lines outside  Not accessible 
the treehouse restaurant alnwick,positive,There is a designated car park located next to the treehouse which is signposted disabled parking drop off which can also be used for people who hold a blue badge. Alternatively their is also blue badge parking in the main Alnwick garden car park which is situated on the same site as the treehouse restaurant and only a short five minute walk away from the treehouse entrance.  Their is a levelled accessible toilet in the treehouse restaurant which was easy to find and clearly signposted. The toilet was clean and tidy. There was grab rails around toilet and plenty of room to manoeuvre and space for a carer.  There is disabled parking near by and in the town The accessible loo was available and had a reasonable size room and facilities. It was clean and very usable
the trentham estate stoke on trent,negative,"Easily accessible buy car.  Disabled parking small, unmarked but no issue at our visit. Didn't use any disabled facilities."
the trentham estate stoke on trent,positive,"Can be busy, but good sized spaces and provided outside the Garden Centre and by the shops. Child and Parent spaces also limited. "
the tunnels bristol,positive,Free parking immediately outside after 6pm.
the two brewers london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby. Several bus routes will drop you off very near the pub. Clapham Junction station is deceptively far away, because it's not actually in Clapham, it's in Battersea. The 345 bus will bring you from Clapham Junction (which is fully step free) to the Two Brewers. The accessible toilet is too small, so that it's very hard to manoeuvre and turn once you're inside. In addition the rubbish bins take up far too much space and make the transfer to the toilet very hard. The toilet is usable, but it's uncomfortable and far from ideal."
the ulster hall belfast,negative,taxi
the ulster hall belfast,positive,We could only find 1 disabled toilet on the ground floor.  I think there should be more available.
the umbrella cafe whitstable,negative,Disabled parking in two public car parks next to the cafe
the union canal edinburgh,positive,"Disabled parking at Linlithgow canal basin, and plenty space at Muiravonside church. Linlithgow train station is near the canal basin Leisure centre car park has plenty spaces , head for the south end and you will see the zig zag ramp up to the canal. Toilet is located within the leisure centre , there are no facilities along the towpath. "
the union canal towpath edinburgh,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Lothian buses 1, 34 and 35 will get you to and from the Canal Basin at Fountainbridge. It is possible to leave the towpath at Harrison Park (buses 34, 35, 44 & 44A will get you back to the city centre from Slateford Road and buses 10 & 27 will get you back to the city centre from Polwarth Terrace. If you leave the towpath at Meggetland, you can catch Lothian 34,35, 44 or 44A on Slateford Road."
the usual place dumfries,positive,"I travelled by wheelchair taxi, dropping off point outside venue, on a very busy main road.Street parking available, the nearest dedicated disabled parking space I observed was at the public library around the corner. Venue is on public bus route The venue has one of the few Changing Places Toilets in the area, however this was blocked by the table taking contact details at the main entrance, so did not view, plenty of helpful staff, so am sure would only take a moment to enable access. Another accessible toilet available, clean , roomy, and plenty of room for chair and carer"
the vale of llangollen canal boat trust llangollen,positive,There is a car park right next to the canal with accessible pathways. Disabled spaces are available but limited in number. Toilet is accessible with a grab rail. A little small but it’s a canal boat so they have done the best job possible to increase space with a sliding door. 
the valley london,negative,"I always go by train (via London Bridge). Charlton train station is 5 minutes walk from The Valley. You'll have to find your own parking space and put time aside to arrive and leave the stadium - the traffic is often bad because of the crowd. I give a low rating as a radar key is needed, a lack of hoists and the temperature of the water is unreliable. The toilets are clean however and there is enough space inside and outside of the toilet for me to get around."
the vaults theatre london,positive,"The nearest tube station is Waterloo. However only the Jubilee line has step free access. There are several buses that stop close by. There are 2 accessible toilets. There is one near the entrance, which is the one I used. It is in a row with other toilets. I was quite shocked when I went in, see photo. The cubicle was very small. To the right of the toilet was a support beam for the roof and on the left was a free standing baby changing table, which when I tried was too heavy to move. There were 2 grab rails, a drop down one next to the toilet and one behind the toilet and the support beam, so difficult to access. When I returned with Liz, a member of staff with the changing table and 2 of us in the toilet including me and my crutch there was no space.  Liz agreed that the changing table would be moved out later the same day. I agreed I would write my review as it was when I visited, but acknowledge what they were planning to do in my review. The accessible toilet had no emergency cord and there was a communal sink was outside the cubicle with the hand dryer above it.  Liz brought to my attention that there was a second accessible toilet which was located by the bar area. This involved walking the entire length of the corridor and through the bar. This toilet was larger. There were grab rails, a regular sink and a baby changing table in the corner."
the velvet coaster blackpool,negative,There is no parking outside the venue and there is limited parking in some of the side streets around the venue. The venue is however just across the road from the South Pier and Sandcastle Water Park.
the velvet coaster blackpool,positive,"Bus stop outside, Pleasure Beach Tram stop across the road  Large car parks nearby  Massive Changes places Accessible toilet  Yes a 5 Star Toilet in a Wetherspoon Pub ?  The reason for this is the fact that it is one of the changing places toilets so has fantastic facilities. It is opened using a Radar key and is located in the corner next to the Bar area on the ground floor. The other toilets are on the upper floor but we did not visit this area. free street parking behind the venue.   disabled toilet on the ground floor. with hoist and changing bed"
the victoria hall stoke on trent,positive,Fully accessible spacious disabled toilet on the lower ground.
the victorian market inverness,positive,"Getting to the Victorian Market is easy as it has entrance on four compass points. You can come out of one entrance and be near the railway station. Leave by another and the buses stops are outside the door or perhaps take the route that places you in the Main Street that runs from the river up toward the modern Eastgate Shopping Centre. We were surprised to find tucked away in a corner a fabulous accessible toilet. Access was via a RADAR key and a notice on the door giving instructions where to get help if you didn't have a key. It was beautifully warm, very spacious, and well appointed."
the view at hencote shrewsbury,positive,Decent size toilet (with an Alarm cord that went to the floor) 😄
the view north shields,positive,"Slope down towards the beach for ramped access or via step flight of stairs st the opposite side. Allocated disability parking spaces on this ramp.  If using public transport, the Metro has a station at Tynemouth and Cullercoats. www.nexus.org.uk/nexus/metro for further information. Easy access toilet is available in the main restaurant. "
the view port william,positive,"The car park beside the venue is, I think, a public car park. The surface is gravel although I was just about able to push the wheelchair over it. It would also be possible to drop someone off at the concrete area at the bottom of the ramp. In the nearby square there is further parking. A roomy accessible toilet with plenty of space for wheelchair and assistant. There are grab rails on both sides. The door to the toilets is easily reached so no-one has to move their chairs to allow access."
the view restaurant newport on tay,positive,I usually park at the front door on the street but have no problem using the car park as it is all on the level and there is a very good ramp at the front entrance.
the village inn largs,negative,There are accessible toilets available Just off the main restaurant. The space in the toilet itself is quite small however it does have handrails
the village restaurant gretna,negative,"Had to ask where toilets were. Sliding door to heavy to move on own,  Difficulty accessing toilet, because of nappy changing mat left hanging down and blocking access. 3 large bins in the room reduced room to manoevere wheelchair. Grab rails in situ, and accessible sink. Emergency cord tied up and inaccessible from wheelchair. As with many disabled toilets that double as nappy changing room, unpleasant smell of soiled nappies. Had to text my brother to come and open the sliding door of the toilet, as I could only reverse my chair out as there was no room to turn due to bins, and heavy sliding door was impossible to move "
the village restaurant gretna,positive,"Plenty of accessible parking close to the restaurant, the Outlet is served by a local bus service"
the vulcan coatbridge,negative,There is no parking outside this bar due to pavement layout and busy road area. There is some limited parking at the rear of the pub but this is mainly for the staff in the shops in this area. The nearest parking is at the Quadrant shopping centre this is a good distance to travel if you have a disability. There is one accessible toilet this is to the left hand side of the bar it has a RADAR key lock on it but was in fact open. It is of a good standard size that you would expect.
the vyne basingstoke,positive,You need a vehicle. When there disabled parking. There is also a buggy to take mobility challenged directed to house. Great. Could move around. Specific to disabled people (not a dual baby changing area) Only 4.5 points as had to wait for 15 minutes whilst an abled father & little boy finished using the Disabled Toilet. Suggested they put a sign on door stating if you not disabled us the door to your left hand side.
the waiting room edinburgh,positive,Parking  was in the 8 space car park which has only 1 disabled space
the wallace collection london,negative,"There are currently no step-free stations nearby but patient visitors might wait for Bond Street Station (which is very near by) to become fully step-free when Crossrail opens some time in 2018. Meanwhile there is an orgy of buses on Oxford Street which will drop you off outside Selfridges, after which it's a short walk/roll up Duke St to Manchester Square."
the wallace collection london,positive,"The Wallace Collection is conveniently located in Central London. We were staying nearby so just tootled along - but it’s not too far from major transport routes. The toilets are in the basement are are reached using the lift I mentioned above. The wheelchair-accessible toilet has an electrically operated door, with big push-buttons both inside and outside the cubicle. The layout is absolutely perfect - full marks! It is a rare pleasure to give a wheelchair accessible toilet five stars!"
the wardrobe leeds,positive,The Wardrobe is very close to Leeds Bus Station and about a 20 minute walk from Leeds City train station. Taxis can drop off outside but we do not know about parking.  The disabled loo is in the backstage area which was pointed out to us. The toilet was cold and they only had wall bars as opposed to a pull down bar. The toilet was clean with enough room for a medium sized wheelchair. There is not enough room for a carer. 
the warehouse gloucester,negative,No disabled parking. Had to park on the road side opposite the centre
the washington forres,positive,There is ample parking nearby with plenty of disabled bays.  
the watch house truro,negative,"There is a public carpark very close to the restaurant, however it gets very busy during the tourist season and you have to pay, even with a blue badge. The carpark gets steeper the further in you go so I would advise trying to park as close to the entrance as possible."
the watergate hotel washington,positive,We travelled from Baltimore airport to the hotel in a wheelchair accessible taxi. There are very few wheelchair accessible taxis in Baltimore/Washington D.C.. We had to call a specific taxi company when we arrived at the airport  to request a wheelchair accessible taxi. The ride was a little uncomfortable and bumpy but we did manage to squeeze ourselves and our luggage in.  Although when we initially arrived at the hotel we did not need a parking space it was good to know that the hotel had an unground car park. There is also a metro station (foogy bottom) approximately 0.6 Miles from the hotel.
the waterside hotel west kilbride,negative,Blue badge spaces at the end of the ramp leading to the front entrance.
the waterside hotel west kilbride,positive,"Parking was directly in front of the hotel off the main road The toilet space in the room was in the wet area with x3 grab rails.  I never needed to use public toilets. The shower is a wheel in shower with x2 grab rails.  The room was a good size, tiled with reduced slip surface. The Waterside is easily accessible by car and there are plenty of disabled parking spaces available in the main car park in front of the restaurant. Accessible toilet is very spacious and well laid out with lots of hand rails "
the weavers table tearooms and bakery paisley,negative,"Disabled toilet/baby change is easily accessible. Currently the baby change table might prove a bit of an obstacle for wheelchair users, but the place is only just opened and the owner has plans to improve this."
the weavers table tearooms and bakery paisley,positive,"Disabled parking across the road, multi-storey car park at the end of the road."
the wee red bar edinburgh,negative,No designated disabled toilet's available.
the welcombe hotel   premier collection by best western stratford upon avon,negative,"If needed, it’s there."
the welcombe hotel   premier collection by best western stratford upon avon,positive,"Parking can be had at far end of hotel, close to Spa, if room. Easy flat level entry then Parking is ok, there’s enough spaces, but no real disabled bays, it’s just take your chance how close to entrance you can get."
the welkin liverpool,negative,A good but basic accessible toilet the door is well marked and it is about half way between the door in and the bar area the area to the toilet door was free of chairs and tables and the door opens outwards. Radar Key required but no room for care giver
the wellington portsmouth,negative,There was parking on the other side of the road which is residents only but can be used with a disabled badge. There are very few dropped kerbs so it took a bit of a detour to cross the road.  There is no accessible toilet. 
the west house dundee,positive,Council car parks with blue badge spaces - one  across road and one about 200 yards away.  Can be dropped off near door.  Bus stops nearby. Adequate room for wheelchair and carer.  Grab rails.  Flush is button on top of cistern.
the wharf inn southam,negative,"2 disabled spaces next to Pub (both occupied at time of visit) Parked on ""old main road"" (now bypassed) at front of building. Best effort has been made to a very old building, toilet is accessible in a wet room with shower, fixed and fold down rails. A little tatty and possibly not suitable for a large power chair to maneuver, transfers may be difficult to users who are not especially mobile. I had no difficulty but am a wheelchair using above knee amputee."
the wheatsheaf inn lower woodford,negative,Only 1 space
the wheatsheaf inn lower woodford,positive,Very good though did have to ask for a couple of high chairs to be moved to gain access.
the wheelabout tenby,positive,Car parking in the house grounds of property The Wheelabout for at least two cars. All amenities score a full 5
the wheelhouse restaurant langbank,negative,"The disabled parking is reasonable with 3 parking bays available. There is a disabled toilet but if I remember right, it isn't that great.  They have got a swing door to the toilets and that isn't really accessible if  the person is on their own."
the whisky shop london,positive,"Green Park station is near by and is fully step-free. Jubilee, Piccadilly and Victoria Lines. Lots of buses serve Piccadilly, so the accessible transport options are excellent."
the white bear ruislip,positive,"Ample parking with 2 designated disabled parking bays. Public transport limited.  A fully functioning disabled toilet facility. Clean, tidy Fully operational with toilet paper/hand wash/drying unit, grab rails . Space for a carer and manoeuvrability .   NO high chairs/chairs/or other detritus in the toilet. 10/10"
the white goose dundee,negative,"As far as I’m aware there isn’t a disabled toilet at this restaurant. It looked like I couldn’t get the toilets because of a high table so, I got my helper to take photos for me. They are all single cubicles and judging by the photos, plus my helpers opinion, I don’t think a wheelchair user would manage, especially if they need assistance. You can see an image of one of the toilets below.  Of course there isn’t a changing place toilet either, the closest one is in the V&A which is a 5 minute walk away and open till at least 5pm. 10pm if the V&A restaurant is open."
the white goose dundee,positive,"There is not a car park available for visiting The White Goose as it is located on a main road. However, with being in the city centre there are plenty of on street parking spaces and council car parks that are 5/10 minute walks away. I would suggest parking in the Gelty Street car park as it is the closet and lots of disabled parking spaces available.  It is a minimum of a 5 minute walk to the train station and there are plenty of bus stops going all over Dundee and Angus."
the white hart cricklade,negative,There is designated parking on the street but you might need to drive around a bit to find it if the spaces near the pub are taken.  Public transport is bus only to the small town
the white hart london,positive,"Walking distance from Waterloo which is accessible on the Jubilee Line. Not sure about parking. Nice and big, only quibble was red cord wasn't hanging freely."
the white horse banbury,negative,There is an accessible loo but it is not signed and is not with the other toilets.  It is small so only really suitable for those who can stand to use the toilet.   Dogs are welcome in the bar but not normally in the restaraunt. I'm sure an assistance dog would be welcome but let them know in advance and I'm sure they would find a suitable table.
the white horse bedford,negative,Two disabled parking spaces. Near the access ramp. The disabled loo is at the other end of the bar from the disabled access ramp.  It’s clean.
the white house guildford,positive,The loo is clearly labelled and is adjacent to the bar. It's Radar key operated but the bar staff happily unlock it if you don't have yours. The loo had all necessary rails and pull cord. It was perfectly clean and was sizeable.
the white house leeds,positive,Lots of disabled parking in front of the building 
the white lady edinburgh,negative,The venue i on a main road which may put some people off but public transport is good and there is ample parking (including disabled spaces).  However wheelchair entry to the bar is less than salubrious being through back doors. A bit cramped and difficult to get into.
the white lady edinburgh,positive,"The restaurant car park is directly next to the ramped, level access.  Good bus service Easy to find, and easy to access.  Good wheelchair turning space inside"
the whitney museum of american art new york,positive,We had just finished Highline before we went to Whitney so for us location was perfect! Good sized loos located within the standard restrooms and fitted out to the U.S. standards. Take the wheelchair accessible bus up Madison Avenue and get off at 74th  Street. High Standard
the whitworth manchester,negative,There is parking directly to the side of the building with disabled parking.  Work was being done on the street when we visited but easy space found.
the whitworth manchester,positive,Easily found.  Although the main entrance looks RADAR key controlled it's not.  All closets are ceiling to floor separated .
the wildebeest stoke holy cross,positive,The restaurant has a reasonable sized car park. There are no designated disabled parking bays. The accessible loo was well signposted. Its a reasonable size. It has good grab rails around the loo and sink. It has an alarm cord. Although there is a baby changing table its drop down so it doesn't take up too much space and was quite light to push up against the wall. The door was reasonably light to open (but does have a door closer). The lock was a good sized lever. To get into the loo the handle was quite small. I recommended another grab rail to make opening the door easier to the staff - I hope they put one on. Good.
the william dampier yeovil,negative,"Not got its own parking, there is parking a few minutes walk away, and so is the bus station. "
the william dampier yeovil,positive,"Easy to find, easy to use. Radar key can be used or if you don't have one if you ask they give you one. "
the william quarrier scottish epilepsy centre glasgow,positive,You have a car park on site and there is also on street parking. You can get here by the number 34 and 3 bus which passes close by. The toilet was large and clean. It had an automatic light when you entered. It had a lever lock that you could operate with a closed fist. The only drawback about the toilet always the flush was on the wrong side.
the wilson art gallery and museum cheltenham,negative,"No parking attached to museum , but as very central in the town  did not have far to go to find disabled parking either on street or in local car parks. Very close to the Cheltenham bus station."
the wilson art gallery and museum cheltenham,positive,"easy access  , plenty of room , good grab rails , alarm cord accessible , and easy to use facilities. Disabled loos on each floor which is excellent. might benefit from adding the wheelchair sign to the male and female figures on the clear signage as then would negate having to ask which floor the disabled facilities were on.Would have given it 5 stars if it has been clearer!"
the wine press dundee,positive,"The view from The Wine Press is actually a public car park, so you're very close to parking and quite a few other bars and restaurants. It's also a short walk from the train station which is great. "
the winslow liverpool,positive,"Newly built disabled toilet, key available from the bar if not already unlocked."
the woodhouse stirling,positive,"Large carpark with designated disabled parking spaces. It's in the country so would need your own transport.  Excellent disabled toilet in main cafe area. I drove to location and ample parking. 2 disabled parking bays. A disabled toilet is available, with grab rails and emergency red cord., It was very clean and tidy.  Several accessible parking spaces next to the building. This is a rural cafe so you'll need a car. There will be a bus passes very close by  Accessible toilet door opens away from the cafe but is in a corridor so it's slightly aukward. Lovely and clean and scented.  For those needing a Changing Place this cafe is a few miles from Blair Drummond Safari park and Stirling "
the woodlands tavern llanvair discoed,positive,2 bays
the woodside worsley,negative,"The ""easy access"" toilet is microscopically small. I could really only just fit my manual wheelchair in. Fortunately I am able to a standing transfer but someone who cannot do this would struggle, there is not enough space to put your chair at the side of the loo even if a bin wasn't there! There is no way you could fit a carer in the room with you as well unless they are very small!  The toilet only has one grab rail on one side which made getting myself back up quite the challenge!"
the woodside worsley,positive,Has a disabled parking bay outside in the car park. I arrived by taxi so I'm not sure about local transport links.
the works restaurant aylesbury,positive,There are some good car parks nearby but not immediately outside. I can push myself with no problem from the multi-storey.  Very easy to find. Spotless. Good handrails. Perfect.
the world of mechanical music northleach,negative,No onsite parking but easy parking around the corner from the museum. Quiet day so might be harder when busy. Buses from Cheltenham stop close to museum but not sure if all are wheelchair accessible. Access into the loo is not wide enough for a powerchair to get through the door easily but about to start work to widen doorway and refurbish to a better specification . Standard height loo and one grab rail and again these facilities going to be upgraded imminently.
the wynd centre paisley,negative,Car. No carpark but public carpark next door on steep hill.
the wynd centre paisley,positive,"Yes, fresh and clean"

Spacious, clean and well equipped. there is lots of parking outside the front of the building. three fully accessible toilets including a bed and hoist"
the york inn exmouth,negative,The toilet was not easily accessible and was not wheelchair friendly. A lot of work needs to be done to bring the disabled toilet up to the required standard.
the york inn exmouth,positive,"It was easy to park outside, but it is not on a bus route."
the younger building edinburgh,positive,"Directed by security staff, there is plenty parking round the back of the building. The security staff direct you to accessible parking that is directly by the entrance."
the zone motherwell,positive,Parking easy and bus stop outside Hand rails and wide doors
theatrau sir gar ffwrnes llanelli,positive,"The venue is located 100 metres from the main town bus station, with traffic free and level access from the bus station through to the front door.   The Eastgate car park, with fully accessible disabled parking bays located just 50 metres from the theatre.  On-street free disabled parking 80 metres, 130 metres and 175 metres from the venue. Drop-down kerbs at all points to cross the road.  A good sized toilet located right next to the box office, enough room to get wheelchair in, carer in, with handlebars to help. "
theatre by the lake keswick,negative,A bit difficult to find - best approached by car (spacious car park with disabled bays) or by foot (just follow the signs for 'The Lake'). Access tight and only just able to fit in. Must reverse out so if you are unable to stand locking the door would be impossible.
theatre by the lake keswick,positive,"Parking available close to entrance Stanndard loo, ground floor On a slope but close to the theatre and lake with a good tarmac surface. If all the blue badge spaces are full it is easy to find and end space as the car park is large. There is a large car park adjacent to the theatre with a number of accessible parking spaces.  I would advise arriving early as this can fill up quite quickly. The wheelchair accessible loos had just enough room to manoeuvre my self-propelled wheelchair, but powerchair users may need to reverse out depending on the size of their chair.  Grab rails were provided.  Acceptable levels of cleanliness, but not great, probably due to it being really busy by all users."
theatre royal bath,positive,The toilets are adequate with just enough room with some careful maneuvering!
theatre royal dumfries,positive,"Easy to find in main reception area. Clean, plenty of room to turn.  Plenty of grab rails in situ.  Room for a carer.  Assistance cord in situ ( complete with Euan’s Guide Red cord card!)"
theatre royal glasgow,negative,"We saw that there were accessible toilets on each floor. The one that we saw was fairly small. Although a public car park nearby, lets me be dropped off and the car then parked in car park."
theatre royal glasgow,positive,"I'm not sure about the nearest bus stop, but there is parking nearby. We walked from Queen Street Station which is about 10 minutes away. Staff are happy to book taxis and assist people into taxis where necessary. Plenty of on street parking  The toilet facilities were roomy, having room to turn my chair with ease and comfort."
theatre royal haymarket london,negative,I could not get into the accessible loo in my wheelchair. Really poor design. Wall opposite the door and the turn is so tight I couldn’t manage. 
theatre royal london,negative,No parking and public transport is not great in Covent Garden if you are in a wheelchair so we went by taxi from Waterloo but wheeled back.
theatre royal london,positive,The accessible toilet is inside the main entrance to the Gentlemen's toilet which is excellent. When the toilet is adjacent to the Ladies I always find lots of non disabled patrons use the toilet which is really annoying during the interval. The toilet was clean and reasonably spacious. 
theatre royal newcastle upon tyne,negative,I used a taxi so have no information about disabled parking. There was a bus stop opposite the theatre so probably  the best bet would be to check with the bus companies for details. The distance from the train station to the theatre  is about 3/4 of a mile and up hill part of the way.
theatre royal newcastle upon tyne,positive,Accessible loos are well signed but the one I used was quite small. It was clean and there was  plenty of hot water. Grab rails were provided and everything was very clean. clean toilets

thecentremk milton keynes,positive,"I managed to find a space relatively easily considering it is December. very easy A fair amount of lovely, flat  accessible parking which is free if you have your blue badge. I have't tried the multi-storey car park but find outside more convenient. Lots of  accessible loos in the centre. Again, John Lewis wins hands down because there are loos on the top and lower floors. It is also the only place that I have come across that has a dispensing machine for tights, tampons etc in an accessible toilet. Thank you JL!"
theory test centre glasgow,positive,There are toilet facilities on most floors and these include disabled accessible toilets. 
thinktank   birmingham science museum birmingham,negative,"Didn't check these out as was out with Grandad so my son went to the mens toilets, but did see a few around."
thinktank   birmingham science museum birmingham,positive,"Based on the currently neglected east side of Birmingham, there is a multi story car pack with lots of disabled parking, (may be challenging for colour blind drivers, as bays and walk ways are marked red for the disabled, blue car parking and green walk ways)"
thirsty cambridge,positive,"The toilet is unisex, fairly large, and accessible-looking with bars by the toilet, low sink and dryer."
thirteen thirty one york,negative,"This venue doesn't have parking but there is a park and ride that stops at exhibition square and you'd have to access the venue on foot over cobbled streets or there is a street in front of the venue where you could be dropped off. The disabled toilet can be found across the courtyard, about 10 metres from the accessible entrance. The toilet is unisex and you have to get the keys for it from behind the bar. It's about 6ft by 4ft with lateral transfer space and wall mounted rails, some of which dropped down. There is a sink and hand dryer. This toilet didn't have a functioning alarm, paper hand towels or a coat hook."
thistle foundation centre of wellbeing edinburgh,negative,"I  always take a taxi cause not sure how to get from Roseburn to here  by bus, "
thistle foundation centre of wellbeing edinburgh,positive,"Accessible car parking bays, right at the entrance, well signposted and plenty space. Fantastic changing places facility within the centre, as well as other accessible spaces. Also very accessible by bus as nearest bus stops are in 5 minutes or less walking distance and many bus routes go close by  allowing visitors to travel there from all over Edinburgh and the Lothians and perhaps further a field  two or more accessible loos available making waiting less necessary, wide variety of facilities useful to people with different types of disabilities and large print and symbols to help the visually impaired or those with learning disabilities  Great parking and lots of space around accessible parking spaces. Lots of busses along Niddry Mains Road (it can be quite busy though) and taxi drop off right outside the door.   HUGE changing places facility and great accessible toilet too.  Winning! Fantastic "
thomas jefferson memorial washington,positive,We travelled to the memorial in a wheelchair accessible taxi. We got dropped at the roadside at the back of the memorial. There are only a few wheelchair accessible taxis in Washington DC so is it necessary to book in advance. There is the Smithonian metro station which is approx. 20 minute walk. 
thomas2 lincoln,negative,"There is no car park at the cafe, but it's not too far from Lincoln central car park. There is a disabled toilet but it's a bit difficult to get into with a wheelchair. The toilet is situated on the side of a small corridor, and when the door is opened you are facing the back of the door. So you have to go past it to get in, but with the door open there is not much room between the door and the opposite wall.  Plus there is not enough room to go past the door before you open it so that you can enter it from the other side. So, Smaller wheelchairs will probably do a better job of getting in here."
thomond park stadium limerick,positive,I travelled to the ground via taxi and they were able to drop me off right outside the ground. I didn't have to wheel far at all to get in.  I didn't use these facilities however there were disabled toilets available just behind the Wheelchair Spaces.
thornbury castle bristol,negative,"The car parking is at the moment on grass land a few hundred feet away from the gateway, but is easy enough to push along for a few feet until you reach the hard pathway leading to castle. There is no designated disabled bays, but more than enough room for all parking. Easy enough to get to, but it’s only a small toilet, so you will need to be able to get up off your chair to use it. It had grab rails to support and help you. Very clean, as expected."
thornbury castle bristol,positive,"On a dry day it is easy enough to push across the grass to reach the level hard path that leads you to the gateway of the castle. It’s on the level, close to reception and the Great hall, but it’s small so maybe you will like I had to, leave the wheelchair outside in a spot you can find. It had grab rails, and was spotlessly clean."
thorp perrow bedale,positive,"There are marked bays near the entrance but on busy days these might all get full, however there is plenty of space . You need to pre-book the scooters by ringing 01677 427203.  There is an accessible loo near the cafe and another at the bird of prey centre, both of which are really spacious with plenty of grab rails. "
threaplands garden centre lhanbryde,positive,4 disabled bays in large car park with level access throughout centre. Large accessible loo with 4 grab rails and an emergency cord Came by car. Easy parking in blue badge space on tarmac close to entrance. Good with suitable fittings and red cord card on the red cord.
threave garden and estate castle douglas,negative,The toilet was on the small side and I didn't have enough space to manoeuvre. It had grab rails and was very tidy though. The door to the bathrooms were very hard to get through with a small doorway and a high bump on the floor (my castors couldn't get over it)
threave garden and estate castle douglas,positive,"Lots of disabled parking. You have to drive up a road to get here and it's not on the bus route and the closest one is in town roughly a mile and a half away. Disable parking next to the visitor centre Easily accessible, clean loos, with room for carer if necessary. Not a Changing Places toilet. There is parking directly outside the front door. I didn't personally access the disabled facilities, but they look pretty good."
three abbey green bath,negative,My cousin had brought her mother to meet us and had parked outside Bath and come in on the bus. This had worked well.  We did not use public transport during our short visit but did see plenty of buses that were labeled with access for disabled but I cannot comment further. I cannot comment about the venue's parking as I don't know what is available. 
three abbey green bath,positive,"Parked in Southgate underground car park, less than 5 minutes walk. Easily accessed via lift We were able to use a ground floor toilet at the Three Abbey Green during the daytime. There was one step down and another up to it but it was preferred rather than using a public toilet. "
three lemons aberfeldy,negative,There is on street parking. There is also limited accessible parking in the town square which is 2-3 minute walk away from the restaurant. There is also a coop shop with parking directly across the road that has accessible parking.
three lemons aberfeldy,positive,A good sized toilet. It also doubles up as baby changing area and sometimes inconsiderate people leave the wall attached changing bench down which is a bit irritating.
threipmuir reservoir balerno,negative,"Nice big car park nearby but the rest needs to be done on foot.  Our group got Social Work transport to the said car park but it may be worth driving and then walking, although nearby Currie is on a good bus route."
thurlaston garden centre tea room leicester,negative,"Largely only accessible by car, I do believe there is an occasional bus service. As mentioned previously there are two designated disabled parking spaces. There is a large area of tarmac for parking then there is a further area of gravel for parking but this is both difficult to push over and is on a reasonably steep hill."
thurrock garden centre south ockendon,positive,There is a large car park with disabled bays right by the entrance. This is on a major bus route.
thurrock thameside nature park stanford le hope,positive,Spacious and clean toilet with plenty of grab rails.  You might need to move the bin but nothing new there!
thursley national nature reserve elstead,negative,"There's a medium sized car park with an impacted dirt surface, broadly level but with occasional roots, stones and dips. No blue badge spaces but there was plenty of space when we went.  I doubt if public transport passes near by so car probably needed."
tick tock unlock liverpool,positive,Fairly basic accessible toilet
tidmoor cottages weymouth,positive,"Secure parking facilities next to cottages.  Accessible buses close by. Spacious. Downstairs wide door. Trombone arm. Raised toilet seat available The parking at Tidmoor Cottages is fine as you park next to the cottage which makes it very easy for unloading. The bath room is OK,the toilet is low which was fine for me as I am short but a raised seat can be supplied if needed, the shower area is fine and there is plenty of hot water. parked just outside front door of cottage. no probs We were met on arrival by Sarah. The cottage was behind secure electric gates in which there was a key fob to open which made it much easier when reversing out. There is local transport (bus) virtually right outside if you wish to travel into Weymouth. A accessible loo with an additional raised seat if you needed it. With drop down supports. There was also a shower chair seat to aide with showering and anti slip mats provided."
tiger martial arts high wycombe,positive,Excellent parking and staff was right there to help and meet and greet It is so big had plenty of room to manouver
tigerlily edinburgh,positive,"Centre of Edinburgh is always going to be an issue for parking but on this occassion we managed perfectly, the original plan had been to get the train in and just push up from Waverley but as it was a miserable day we opted for the car instead. Toilets were perfect for my needs, as I do ISC's I don't need to transfer, so no issue "
tiled hall cafe leeds,negative,"I think it's bad practice for accessibility that because one set of toilets is broken, that this then stops accessible toilets being used too. Signage to alternatives needs improving."
tillicoultry baptist church tillicoultry,positive,There is limited parking next to the church in Murray Square and includes a disabled parking bay. The local bus bay is also at Murray Square with access to many local towns.
tillybods wakefield,positive,We walked as we live close by. Tillybods is in a residential area. There is a bus stop very close by with links to Leeds and Wakefield. There is roadside parking available close by. 
tim hortons barcelona,positive,Subway lift is just down the street

time tide north berwick,positive,"Like any town with shops in the centre of a town, parking is plentiful but it is just your luck on whether you get a space or not we drove around the centre twice and were able to find a disabled parking space within 10 mins. the space was within 3 mins walking of the restaurant we were going to and 5 mins from the shop. "
times square new york,negative,"Parking in general is not popular in central Manhattan. People rarely drive as the city is very busy meaning car parks are further out of the city and would then require further transport to reach the centre or a long and busy walk. The large crowding of the city is the main factor impacting the overall score.  Overall toilets were usually clean. Large restaurants and shopping centres would have accessible lifts to get to the fully equipped and accessible toilets. However, smaller businesses often did not have accessible toilets, nor were they equipped with grab rails. "
timpson edinburgh,positive,"Bus Service on this main route in and out of the City is  well provided in either direction, there is ample parking too."
tinkerbells emporium stirling,positive,"I parked about a 10-minute walk away on a side street as we were wandering around the shops but, I’m not sure about what other parking is available as I’m not from Stirling.  The bus and train station is roughly a 5-minute walk away. I don’t know where the nearest local bus stop is though. "
tintinhull garden yeovil,negative,Only accessible by car - through narrow village roads. Drop off point for disabled close to the house/entrance. Then parking in a field about 400m away (across a grassy orchard) Present but not visited.
tinto tapas bar glasgow west end glasgow,negative,On street parking adjacent door to restaurant but can be busy big enough and fine for somebody with walking stick etc but a bit crowded with stored equipment. But for somebody in a wheelchair it would be bit difficult to access as at the rear of restaurant and would perhaps need staff to move items around toilet door and possibly in the toilet itself
tirana international airport nene tereza tirana,negative,"There are no direct flights to Tirana from Edinburgh, from the Airport to the City of Tirana there are buses but with no dedicated disabled support, taxi is the most popular, there is no train service in Albania, buses can be disorganised and leave and arrive at one venue in Tirana, there is no organised timetable. Did not see any dedicated disabled or priority parking."
tiree ranger service crossapol,positive,"This is difficult to assess, as we are not normally wheelchair users. The wheelchair user would need assistance to manoeuvre on to the beach and would need to be pushed. Drove my own car. Ferry terminal in Oban is accesible if required although tickets can be printed in advance so no real need to leave your car. Car gets a 25% discount with a Blue Badge which is a saving on an approximately  £100 ticket. Access is via Lift from the car deck, the staff are excellent and very friendly, the right balance of offering to help and accepting that you are not helpless.  Ferry is OK,but acess to the open deck is very limited to a small very enclosed area on the bow of the ship  There is no publicly accesible lift on the boat and therefore you are limited to the main deck, however this is where the restraunt and shop are located, not much of an issue.   Parking was never an issue on the Island, the Single COOP had a space directly outside. The Male and Femal Public toilets in Scarinish are both accesible toilets and are serviceable. Easy too find, very close to the COOP. They are also accesible to the sheep, who do not always get there on time, but there are local volunteers who clean up after them, dont worry to much it's only sheep poo, washes off easily and isn't too smelly  There are toilets in the Hotel and local Cafes although I didnt have need to use them"
tiso aviemore outdoor experience aviemore,positive,Great - there is parking right outside the front door.
tissington trail ashbourne,positive,"Study any good map and the trail is easy to trace from Ashbourne to Buxton with several accessible points, mainly where there used to be stations or where there is a decent car park. Some of the bridge/road points are not accessible. We got on at Hartington Station. Disabled loo at former Tissington station - bit grotty but welcome!  If going to Herbert's, they have a lovely one."
titanic belfast belfast,positive,The disabled toilet was spacious and had enough room for the carer. The toilet we used had just been cleaned and it was regularly cleaned throughout the day.
titanic experience cork,positive,One disabled parking space by the attraction.
titanic hotel liverpool,positive,"As already described. Although I only saw 2 disabled  bays outside main entrance and a few further down the car park, there seemed ample parking.  We had a disabled toilet in our bedroom which was perfect (other than a small sink).. We didn’t visit the toilets on the ground floor but I noticed a sign for a disabled toilets."
tivoli gardens copenhagen,negative,"There are accessible toilets but even with a map I found it difficult to locate them. It was especially difficult in the evening as the signs are very small. There was an accessible toilet in the aquarium, which was spacious, clean and had grab rails. However when I later needed to the toilet I found the accessible toilet was closed and some shrubbery had been placed in front of the door. There was no sign to say where the nearest accessible toilet was. "
tivoli gardens copenhagen,positive,We arrived by cruise ship and took the local bus =£5 return. All buses accessible and drivers friendly and helpful with putting the ramp out.  Antiquated but adequate. There was even an adult changing bed. Like something from “Carry on Matron”.  Tivoli is right in the city centre by the main railway station. There are also a number of buses that stop close by the entrance. The buses are accessible and drivers were helpful. 
tk maxx edinburgh,positive,"I came by public transport - there's some buses that come directly into the park, although I'm not sure what services, and you can also get a bus into Asda and then make your way through from there (buses that go into Asda include the 4, 5 and 49). There's lots of parking spaces available throoughout the park."
tk maxx york,negative,TK Maxx is located in the centre of town without a car park. There is always a distance  from a car park to access the store. The train station is also nearby. The nearest car park is the Q-Park Shambles.
tlh carlton hotel torquay,negative,The car park is right outside the hotels doors and around the side. You can reserve a parking space to be closer to the main doors. There is a bus stop outside the hotel and across the road so very close.
tlh carlton hotel torquay,positive,There is a disabled toilet right by the reception. The toilet is large and easy to manoeuvre with enough space for a carer.
tobermory ferry terminal tobermory,negative,"Had a look for the accessible loo that CalMac promised on Euan's Guide but couldn't see anything. Ended up eventually going to a public accessible loo in the aquarium/harbour management building 10 mins walk away at the far end of the seafront (luckily I was using a scooter so I could get there), and that was excellent. Well done aquarium. "
tobermory ferry terminal tobermory,positive,There didn't seem to be any special arrangements for cars carrying disabled people; you just park in a queue to get on the ferry like everyone else.
toby carvery liberton edinburgh,positive,"Adequate disabled parking and additional parking from the far side of the building. The entrance is not very obvious, as there is another door central on the building.   Bus stop is close by on the main road, the only concern is if not coming in a vehicle there is not a pathway or adequate lighting on the driveway. "

toby carvery strathclyde park motherwell,positive,"Accessible parking right outside. Plenty of parking outside including blue badge bays at the entrance. All level access inside. No public transport as it is in Strathclyde Park. Taxis can be phoned. At the blue badge pays the drop kerbs don't match up completely but the main kerb is completely flat. Accessed via RADAR key to the right of the carvery. It is also a baby change facility. Hand rails on either side of the bathroom. A red cord is hanging to the floor on the right hand side of the toilet. There is one vertical hand rail next to the sink. It is on the smaller side but I managed inside with my power chair and a companion although there was no room for me to turn fully, I just rolled in and reversed out."
tobycarverylauristonfarm edinburgh,negative,"The venue is a bit off the beaten track (we arrived by tail lift bus) so a walk may be incurred.  However, there is a lovely big car park."
tobycarverylauristonfarm edinburgh,positive,"It has it’s own car park, including disabled spaces  Excellent - easy to find, large, clean and well appoited. I was driven there but the nearest bus stop is a few hundred yards way Well signposted access with radar key. Always clean."
today bread london,positive,"Walthamstow bus station is near by, as is Walthamstow Central Station, which is step-free for London Overground but NOT step-free for the Victoria Line, which terminates here.  A good accessible toilet, a bit too cramped with excess bins, so turning space is limited. Initially I found the red emergency cord tied up at a very high level, but as soon as I mentioned this to staff they promptly untied it and put a sign on it asking people not to tie it up, as it needs to hang freely all the way to the floor in case anyone falls over and needs to summon assistance from the floor. "
todsworthy farm holidays albaston,positive,Parking out front with level access. Ground floor bedroom with wet room en suite.
tog 24 livingston,negative,"Lots of parking at outlet village, but not much blue badge parking and you have to pay the same as everyone else, with no additional time allowed for blue badge."
tollcross international swimming centre glasgow,positive,"Ample parking spaces including Disabled and Family designated spaces. Nearest bus stop is a short walk away. Toilets within the complex are well sign posted and easy to find. Disabled toilets have enough room to manoeuvre, are very clean and have grab rails to provide support. Plenty of disabled bays right along the front of the centre with lowered kerbside. The accessible toilet I was shown was the best I have seen in any venue, anywhere in the world. At one point there were 6 wheelchair users and 3 others in the toilet and there was still plenty of space! CG2014 venues have no on-site parking however for general use in the future thought car parking signage was insufficient. Great for pubic transport  They have a couple of the disabled toilet  Car park quite small. Several blue badge bays. The bathroom is very big and spacious. All the equipment you need. Parking for disabled visitors right outside the front door! Accessible buses pass along the nearby road and will take you into the city centre. There's one of the best wet rooms and loo that I've ever seen. It's set out in a similar style to the Changing Places loos complete with hoist and changing facilties; as well as a shower. On our visit we managed to get five wheelchair users in the room at the same time to take a look!  Other accessible toilets were avaialble in the changing areas and in the cafe area.  For wheelchair users wanting to watch the swimming there were dedicated platforms."
tomatin distillery visitor centre tomatin,positive,"Tomatin Distillery is set a short distance from the main Inverness to Perth (A9) road and is some sixteen or so miles south of Inverness. Interestingly, you also get a great view from the train as the railway passes on a viaduct above the whisky sheds.  The majestic entrance with its stone walled branding leads you along a single track roadway that starts ascending the hillside. A burn flows rapidly on your left and the grey imposing structures of the whisky bonds are on your right. Passing under an archway of the railway viaduct above the cottages and houses of the distillery village come in to view. A sweeping turn to the left and a bridge across the burn your roll into the distillery yards.  Disabled motorists can park in one of the two accessible parking bays adjacent to the visitor centre building. The main car parking is just a short distance around the corner in the shelter of one fo the whisky stores. The distillery visitor centre had toilet facilities, including an accessible toilet. The accessible toilet was spacious, clean and well appointed. "
tonic dundee,positive,"There is no car park for this restaurant however, there is a council car park a 5-minute walk away and on street parking close by. There are lots of bus stops up and down the Perth Road which most buses stop and there are taxi ranks nearby too. Train station is roughly a 15-minute walk away."
tony macaroni dundee,negative,"Did not need to use the facilities and also as explained in other reviews I am a hoist transfer so can't use normal disabled toilets. However, I did not see any signage for a disabled toilet when entering the restaurant. "
tony macaroni dunfermline,positive,Lots of space to park and lots of disabled spaces free.
tony macaroni edinburgh,positive,The restaurant has an accessible toilet. You go through a door shared with the other facilities into a lobby where the loo entrance is. This first door is heavy but staff have been quick to help when I have used it. The accessible loo is fine. Bus stop very close by that a number of buses stop at. I believe there is parking underneath the Omni Centre but we didn't use it on this visit. Spacious and clean. Lots of buses from Leith walk and also from the bridges.   Disabled parking in Omni centre car park (warning - it is expensive!) A decent size and clean.
tony macaroni glasgow,positive,"disabld parking directly opposite, 20 m fro door There is ample parking with plenty of accessible spaces. Silverburn has its own bus terminus a couple of hundred yards from an entrance, so plenty of buses. Toilet was clean and tidy. There was a door to enter the corridor to the toilets but there is plenty of staff and people about to give you a hand. It had a sliding door to enter the toilet."
tony macaroni livingston,positive,"I think it's a few hundred yards from the bus route, not sure, but disabled parking is fine"
top barn farm shop worcester,negative,"Parking close to shop entrance, no disabled bay as not needed Wooden old shed, in need of work, no actual disabled toilet, just same as public use, it does have a grab rail, but, well, look at photos."
topolabamba edinburgh,positive,"Great public transport on Lothian Road. Being on Lothian Road, this restaurant is great for buses. It's also very close to the taxi rank opposite Usher Hall."
topolabamba glasgow,positive,"There was an accessible loo at the rear of the restaurant. It had a sliding door which could have been tricky for some, but it had everything I needed from a loo."
topping company booksellers of edinburgh edinburgh,positive,"I came by bus and this dropped me off across the road. Lothian buses 1, 4, 5, 14, 15, 22, 25, 34, 44, 49 pass this way. The accessible toilet is great in my opinion. It is in the back of the shop near the lift and travel books. No key is required and the Red Cord was hanging to the floor which is great."
topshop edinburgh,positive,"This Topshop is a stone's throw away from Waverley Station, it's great. It's also really close to Tram stops and bus stops, not to mention several taxi ramps."
topshop york,negative,"I did not notice any disabled parking outside the shop. However, there is a public car park which contains disabled car parking about 5-10 minutes walk away. I did not notice any toilets."
tor na coille hotel banchory,negative,The disabled toilet on the ground floor is in the ladies toilet - not ideal.
tor na coille hotel banchory,positive,If you're lucky you can park right outside the main entrance - however this is not designated for disabled parking

torrance hotel glasgow,positive,2 disabled parking spaces Disabled toilet just off the bar area. Very spacious and plenty of grab rails
torre abbey torquay,positive,"Torre Abbey is a 8-10 minute level walk from Torquay train station and similar but slightly shorter from the sea front. There are no buses that stop directly outside but there are many buses that stop on the sea front nearby. If you approach from the sea front from King's Drive, there is the very pleasant Kings Gardens, with a pond and wildfowl, which also offers bench seating.   If you arrive by car there is designated disabled parking spaces (see photo). The cafe has an accessible toilet, which was spacious and clean. It had grab rails and an emergency cord, but it didn't reach to the ground.   There were some portaloos at the side of the Spanish Barn which included an accessible one. However I didn't use this."
torrieston by elgin,negative,No toilets. I guess closest may be in the village or Elgin.
torrieston by elgin,positive,Need a car to get here and then there is a gravelled parking area which was busy at the weekend but very quiet on the week day I visited. No spaces are marked so you can park away from others as though in a blue badge space. There is an information board which shows the disabled access walk information and map.
torwood garden centre larbert,negative,Not many disabled spaces. Car park quite bumpy to get over on wheelchair wheels. can't get to it with a wheelchair due to all the junk in the corridor outside. Had to abandon chair and struggle down on sticks.
torwood garden centre larbert,positive,"There was an accessible toilet which had everything I needed. Grab rails next to the toilet, emergency pull cord and space for turning my wheelchair. There was mirror positioned high on the wall, but it was angled facing down so I was able to use it just fine."
totnes rare breeds farm totnes,negative,"Short ramp up to the door, heavy spring, door only opens half way. I only just got in. Door opens inwards and the toilet is exposed to people on the train platform if carer/assistant exits. No toilet on the farm side of the railway. "
totnes rare breeds farm totnes,positive,We came via steam train. Train has ramp access and the station has a hard surface slope down to the track to cross to the farm ( see pictures).   
tottenham hotspur stadium london,negative,"I used a cab, but there is also parking free for blue badge holders. There is a step free station nearby, however, as with all TFL transport the lift is not always reliable. Plenty of buses pass the stadium."
tottenham hotspur stadium london,positive,Plenty of space.
tottergill farm cottages brampton,positive,"Designated space for this cottage. On rather a slope. Access to farm involves rough, pot-holed track. Wetroom bathroom with one grabrail by showewr and one by toilet. Owners will lend seat raiser and shower seat. Full access statement with measurements on owners' website."
touchbase glasgow,negative,There is ample on street parking. Paisley Rd West is a short walk and is serviced by many bus routes 
touchbase glasgow,positive,"The building has many accessible toilets. The one I visited was very clean and roomy. The one negative was that the alarm cord was tied up. The toilet facilities are brilliant - so spacious, well equipped and comfortable. They are always so clean and stocked with baby wipes and cleaning products. They are great for any age so hopefully as my daughter grows, I can continue to take her to Touchbase and not worry about accidents/changing etc"
towcester racecourse towcester,negative,Close to the entrance but the car park is a little rough and rocky so not a smooth surface
towcester racecourse towcester,positive,Great facilities very spacious just difficult to initially get into the doors are quite heavy and would require some assistance.
tower bridge exhibition london,positive,"Great carpark at Towerhill not very big but we had no problem getting a space & managed to get a blue badge one too. Very reasonably priced for London £2.50/hr. I'd definitely use this carpark again. It is recommended on Tower Bridge website as the nearest one. I called the staff for more details & found them  to be very helpful. There were disabled toilets in the exhibition which were plenty big enough with good disabled facilities. My only concern was there wasn't one in the entrance area, the first one was on the South side of the exhibition. This meant seeing some of the exhibits wondering how far the toilet would be!"
tower bridge london,positive,"Being in the City of London there's loads of transport options with nearby Tube, DLR, and mainline stations, as well as buses and taxis. The accessible loo in the South tower was great; in fact one of the nicest I've seen for space, cleanliness and usability."
town end farmshop airton,negative,There is a large car park. There are no designated blue badge spaces. There's plenty of space to park but the issue is being able to park close to the shop and this is a very popular place. The car park surface is uneven and has loose chippings in places.
town end farmshop airton,positive,"There's a disabled loo adjacent to the main gents and ladies loos. Well signed, clean, well equipped."
town of cannes cannes,positive,I travelled to Cannes on the Express 210 bus. This departs from Nice Airport every 30 minutes during the day and the bus serves both Terminals 1 and 2 in both directions. The bus itself is a coach. There are 3 - 4 steps up at the entrance and a sign by the front door showing a person with a stick. In the middle door is a wheelchair sign. The journey cost 33 euros return (2017) and journey time via a motorway took about 40 minutes.  While I was in Cannes I walked everywhere so unable to comment about local public transport. However I did noticed that there were frequent buses driving along La Croisette. the sea front.
town of colchester colchester,negative,No red cord or tied up high 
town of lourdes lugagnan,positive,Transportation made very easy with fully equipped lift access coach.
towneley park burnley,positive,"Usually good access to parking, but can be limited near the hall."
trafalgar square london,positive,"Nice and clean. When I went in they were with the radar keys that they were not abused by the general public There are lots of buses that stop close by. Nearest tube stations are Charing Cross or Leicester Square, neither are step free. The nearest step free tube stations are Green Park or Tottenham Court Road. The accessible toilet was very clean and tidy. It is accessed directly off the square, on the National Gallery side. There are separate men and women toilets and each also has an accessible toilet. The accessible toilet on the women's side is just before the pay turnstile. It can be opened with a radar key or you can ask a member of staff to unlock it for you. The toilet is large with grab rails.  My only concern is the colour contrast for people with a visual impairment. The walls, door, sink, soap dispenser and toilet are all made of the same shade of stainless steel. Also the hand dryer and floor are grey. Bright red foam has been put on the grab rails, but no where else.  By the door was a red light (not illuminated) and below what appeared to look like a reset button. However, I could not see an emergency cord or button for assistance, although it looks like at one time there might have been one given the light and button. Accessible London Buses pass on two sides of the square. The toilets to the North side of the square have standard male and female sections as well as a dedicated accessible toilet. The toilet staff will open the door for you. It is a clean, fairly spacious and modern in design. Its level access from the square."
tram stop edinburgh,positive,A great hub for getting the tram or changing to one of the many buses that stop at the adjacent bus stops.
tramway glasgow,negative,"Got  a bus from city centre, bus stop about 100 meters from venue. "
tramway glasgow,positive,Disabled parking at venue Spacious and reasonably easy to access.  Well kept and clean although possibly showing its age See photographs
translink brisbane city,positive,As before
transportation lipa,negative,"Public Toilets are not available, many just use the road side as a toilet for pee. Many toilets are not cleaned properly, tissue has to be taken with you."
travelodge bath waterside bath,positive,Three designated Blue Badge parking spaces which were free for the duration of our stay. Ramped access and automatic doors made for very easy access.
travelodge birmingham airport birmingham,positive,We were allowed to park beside the reception for 15 minutes and then we parked about 1 minute away from the entrance to the hotel. You'll need to book your car parking at least 24 hours before your stay. The loo in my bedroom had everything that I required.
travelodge birmingham sheldon birmingham,negative,Bathrooms in the rooms are large and have grab rails but they have normal baths unadapted and therefore unusable if you cannot climb into them.
travelodge birmingham sheldon birmingham,positive,Busy location but once there it does have many disabled parking spaces so no problems. Don't know about nearby buses.
travelodge bodmin roche saint austell,positive,I parked outside front doors in disabled space. All level access.Public transport 100yds to St Austell.
travelodge bolton central river street bolton,positive,"You can park for up to 15 minutes beside the reception, however, there is a private car park about 5 minutes away from the hotel and there are disabled spaces. The bathroom deserves special mention. I am a mobility scooter user with very limited physical mobility. The shower was superb having all necessary grab handles and a wide shower seat which made for a more secure shower experience. Toilet grab handles were also perfectly positioned.  Overall the bathroom facilities were of such a high standard that they should be used as an example for disabled facilities for other hotels."
travelodge bristol severn view bristol,positive,Has 2 Disabled bays near door.  In accessible rooms there are very large bathrooms with plenty of room to move about
travelodge cheshire oaks ellesmere port,negative,"It's in a retail park with cinema, restaurants etc - so parking is pot luck. We found close parking fine.  New style accessible bathroom. We took our own hair wash basin as typically the sinks are too small to lean over. Plenty of turning space for over shower chairs but probably not a hoist. All clean and warm - my only person difficulty is the seat was an elongated narrowed style which hurts my pelvis. Always pot luck what fixtures and fittings will be used. Floor grip was reasonable. Large door entry."
travelodge dublin airport north swords hotel swords,positive,"plenty of space to get in/out of wheelchair taxi, disabled parking too. only used the one in my room and it was grand except the emergency chord is in a silly place, too easily set off when getting in and out of bath from wheelchair."
travelodge edinburgh central edinburgh,positive,"We travelled by car and used the on-site parking next to the building. There were 3 dedicated disabled parking spaces, car park fills quickly Those with mobility restrictions may be better being dropped off at entrance, as carpark hilly, and quite a walk from the carpark. Parking free to blue badge holders, advised to let reception aware on check in. Public buses passed by  10 minutes walk for abled bodied people from Waverley Railway Station Noticed lots of wheelchair accessible taxis in the area Accessible toilet in reception area, not visited  Bathroom in accessible bedroom roomy and plenty of grab rails"
travelodge edinburgh central princes street edinburgh,positive,The toilets in your room is large and spacious with plenty of room to leave a wheelchair.
travelodge gateshead newcastle upon tyne,negative,i think there was about 10 disabled parking spaces in the car park near reception. 
travelodge gateshead newcastle upon tyne,positive,I think there were some disabled parking spaces near reception. 
travelodge glasgow paisley road hotel glasgow,positive,There is no specific disabled car parking but the hotel has private parking so it is not a long walk to the hotel! Great accessible toilet with plenty of room for maneuverer. 
travelodge glasgow queen street glasgow,negative,"There are parking bays on the street that can be used for free with a Blue Badge. However, being the city centre, it’s very busy and they were often all taken up. There is discounted (via the hotel) parking in the NCP Glasshouse car park in Glassford Street a block or so away. Glasgow City Councils own website says Blue Badge users can park on double yellow lines but fails to say NOT in a no loading area, which this part of Queen Street is. As a result we got a parking ticket! Currently appealing!"
travelodge glasgow queen street glasgow,positive,"In the cafe/bar, there’s a manually operated lift to the lower floor for the accessible loo. All good. Queen Street is easily accessible from either Queen Street station or Central station near the city centre. Parking could be slightly more tricky because of the city centre location. I can’t comment on any public toilets within the hotel but the toilet in the room itself was very spacious and had handrails and an emergency red cord."
travelodge grantham a1 hotel grantham,positive,Fine for our needs.
travelodge hemel hempstead gateway hemel hempstead,positive,"There was two bay, they weren't exactly close to the building however.  About a 10 meter walk, there was normal bays closer. It was fine for my needs, nice high toilet.  However the shower sucked!  It was basically a dribble and no pressure. Decor wise the bathroom just needed a bit love."
travelodge hotel inverness fairways inverness,positive,"Plenty parking spaces adjacent to the hotel. My room had Easy accessible toilets with no roll in shower. Instead, it had a bath with a shower over it with plenty of grab rails."
travelodge inverness city centre hotel inverness,positive,"The Travelodge in Academy Street offers guest an amazing location to stay and use as a base to explore the city. We arrived by train and it was a short five minute walk from the railway station to the hotel. The bus station was equally close being a few minutes walk away with connections for local buses and the long distance services.  The hotel has automated entrance doors. These are accessed via a shallow ramp with hand rails for all visitors.  The location is excellent as a base for exploring as it is within minutes of the railway station, the bus station, the Caledonian Sleeper office, the main streets, and the riverside. There is an accessible toilet in the lobby adjacent to the reception.  "
travelodge inverness inverness,negative,Disabled parking close to door.
travelodge inverness inverness,positive,"There were a few disabled parking bays directly outside the hotel front door. There was plenty of non-disabled parking bays too around the hotel. The accessible loo in the room was very spacious and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. There was  a bath with an over-bath shower, but there was an internal bath bench which gave me the choice of a bath or shower. Obviously this won't necessarily suit  those who require a wet floor shower room. We travelled by car, easy to find, several accessible parking spaces Accessible bathroom, clean and roomy, plenty grabrails. No wet room, but the website clearly states there isn’t one at this location. There was however a bath seat available, the first time I’ve seen this in a hotel. Red cords in bathroom and bedroom"
travelodge kinross m90 kinross,negative,It has 2 disabled parking spaces right in front of building.  I parked my car in their car park
travelodge kinross m90 kinross,positive,"The loo in the room was accessible and had grab rails and emergency red cord. It was big with space for a carer.  I say it was accessible, it a bit of a tight turn to get into it but once in it was great apart from shower over bath"
travelodge liverpool stoneycroft liverpool,positive,parking and buses Room comes with a wet room.
travelodge london central waterloo london,negative,Taxi parking outfront was ideal. Its about a 10 min walk from Waterloo Station but was disappointed to realise there's no step free access to many of the lines so attempting to the tube was off the table. 
travelodge morecambe hotel arndale centre,positive,"No parking on site, car park nearby, 20 metres, Blue Badge, no charge, unlimited time. Toilet available at entrance, access by wheelchair. Disability room available on request with grab rails around the toilet and emergency chord."
travelodge scarborough st nicholas hotel scarborough,negative,"The hotel is situated in a square opposite the Grand Hotel, there are parking meters all around the square but it is VERY difficult to get a space, we parked around the corner and walked to the hotel, you can drop off outside the hotel or park for 3 hours on double yellow lines with a blue bade just at the front."
travelodge scarborough st nicholas hotel scarborough,positive,"Toilet in the room is fine, grab rails and hand rails to the side. I didn't use the bar accessible toilet."
travelodge swindon west swindon,positive,"Car park with 3 disabled spaces.  Cant comment on public transport  Excellent wetroom in the bedroom. Plenty of grab rails, lower sink, mirror,  soap dispensers and electric razor points. Large comfortable fold down shower seat"
traverse theatre edinburgh,negative,"There are several disabled parking spaces beside venue  in Cambridge Street but several venues use them so not always available. More spaces a couple of streets away outside Lyceum theatre. There is a multi storey car park nearby which I have not used so do not know how user friendly it is. There is a disabled toilet on ground level. The only thing I would say is that it is behind two sprung doors, and these posed a problem for me on crutches.  The toilet itself was adequate though. I didn't check it out but my pal was suprised that it wasn't a bit bigger. The door also opens inwards so there wasn't too much space."
traverse theatre edinburgh,positive,"Easy to find, almost big enough. Disabled parking is situated right outside the theatre, good accessibility  There are some disabled parking bays in Cambridge street just opposite the entrance I didn't require the disabled parking, but apparently they have disabled parking spaces on Cambridge Street, just opposite the theatre. Large loo, doubles as baby change. Red cord doesn't reach the ground. Easy to get there on public transport - the Traverse is just off lothian road. There are also several parking bays nearby."
treacle bar kitchen edinburgh,negative,"There is no designated accessible bathroom in this restaurant, but the main toilets are on the level-access floor of the restaurant. The doors appear to be standard width doors, so they will not be accessible to everyone. I asked some staff members about this and they told me they have had wheelchair users in the past use these toilets. So they will be accessible to some, but not all. It's worth checking with the venue in advance. The restaurant is around a 5 minute walk from the Omni Centre which does have accessible toilets."
treacle bar kitchen edinburgh,positive,Brilliant bus links on York Place and it is on the tram line.
treadwells books london,negative,"There is a bus stop nearby & taxis can be found in the area, although it is some distance from an accessible tube station."
treadwells books london,positive,"The nearest accessible, step-free station is Tottenham Court Road. There are several buses that stop very close by."
tredegar house duffryn,positive,"Plenty of  wide bay parking. Easy access by road. Came by car.  Room enough, but not unusually NO MIRROR!!"
trenchers restaurant and takeaway whitby,positive,Amazing - grab rails - plenty of space - unbelievably clean
trengwainton tearooms trengwainton,negative,Disabled parking bays near to tea room.  Car park gets very full so may have to drop the disabled person off and park in another part of it.  On bus route from Penzance.
trengwainton tearooms trengwainton,positive,Loo next to other loos at end of tearoom.  Brilliantly set up with grab rails and low access basin.  Approached via a lobby with room to turn wheelchair and I reckon there is room for a second person although didn't need that.  Very clean.
trent bridge cricket ground west bridgford,negative,It is best to arrive at the ground on foot; parking is best done in a side street although plenty of public transport is available.  No parking at the ground.
trent bridge cricket ground west bridgford,positive,"There are several dotted all round the ground (some need a RADAR key) but all are large, clean and fully accessible. Parking is available price £5 got there little late and ended up in carpark at the pub just on the otherside of trent bridge about ten minute walk.  To get good parking go early. Plenty of toilets but i didnt need use them but facilities look clean if you want drink go between overs coz end of innings creates big ques"
trevase granary hereford,positive,there is parking adjacent to the building. As it is in the middle of the country visitors would need their own transport. The loo in the wet room next to the downstairs bedroom has a handrail adjacent. The owners provided a raised toilet surround for our visit. there is plenty of space to manoeuvre in. 
trevi fountain rome,negative,I'm not sure if the area is meant to be pedestrianised but it definitely feels like it. I couldn't imagine many cars wanting to navigate through the crowds here. The streets leading to the fountain are narrow and winding like most of Rome's older districts.
tricheco bologna,negative,"Public transport, buses where pretty good in Bologna but totally inaccessible! "
tricheco bologna,positive,see pic
trinity cheltenham cheltenham,negative,When you arrive at the church is quite difficult for disabled users to get inside as you need to cross the road however there is no dropped curbs for disabled users so I had to go down the end of the road and cross there. Access to the toilet was difficult as you have to cross the road and it is difficult is a part of a different building. Small toilet with 2 hand rails either side
trinity college dublin,positive,RIght next to Trinity Luas stop and if you have a disabled badge they will usually let you park inside if you enter at Lincoln Place Accessible bathrooms throughout and changing places bathroom on the ground floor of the Arts Block. Ask security to open it for you.
trinity kitchen leeds,positive,"The site has two accessible toilets next to the main food court, these are large enough to move around in when in a medium size electric wheelchair and have appropriately placed grab rails "
trinity leeds,positive,"The only thing that could be done better is having some toilets on the ground floor as well. The toilets that are available have very good disabled access, with large standard toilets or even larger disabled toilets if needed. These are on the first floor which is accessed by going in a lift."
trivia trails warwick,positive,We met the organiser at Pub in Warwick and we parked in a disabled parking bay just a couple of minutes from the meeting point. I do not know if there was disabled parking exactly at the meeting point but this may be something to look into.  Good accessible toilet at the meeting venue 
trnsmt festival glasgow,positive,"There is a street closed off for blue badge parking. All you need to do is show your blue badge and show your ticket. There are disabled toilets throughout the festival, including a large number within the enclosed viewing platform area. The toilets are well stocked with toilet roll which is topped up throughout the day, there is water for washing your hands and there is alcohol and sanitiser."
troon swimming pool troon,positive,"Troon Swimming Pool has several disabled parking spaces available. It is right next to a bus stop and a 5 minute walk from Troon Train Station. The disabled toilet is good and clean. However, it could be a challenge if two people are required to access it as the toilet isn't that big. There are large disabled parking spaces right next to the venue. There is also a bus stop across the road from the swimming pool, with traffic lights in which you can cross at safely. The toilet was large with easy access and the ability to manoeuvre around inside the toilet was good. There could have been more sings to direct you to where the toilet was but other than that it was very good."
tropical butterfly house north anston,positive,Ample disabled parking bays close to the entrance Did not use but well sign posted
tropical butterfly house sheffield,positive,"Parking for blue badge holders is next to the entrance. This is the first time it’s been busy, and I suspect the lack of parking attendants means non badge holders had helped themselves. But we did get a space, and if you had to park in the main car park, it’s all level access. There are plenty of disabled loos, though the one close to the cafe down a tight corridor is worth avoiding when open (tight corridor, parents using it as a baby change). The rest are spacious and clean. I don’t think any are Changing Places, however. Please check online."
tropical world leeds,positive,"There are 2 (that I could see) massive disabled parking bays just outside that hold about 6 cars each. The buses are also very regular and the stops aren't far away. I was reliably informed that they were sufficient, there is also a disabled access toilet in the reception/giftshop area at the start and another in the walk through experience itself."
tropiquaria wildlife park washford cross,positive,"There are dedicated spaces for disabled drivers and passengers, just be aware that the car park is gravel. Nice big toilet, but it is a shared space which has baby changing. There are no ' Changing Spaces' however which is sad. Able to park right outside, less than 10m to the gate. One set of disabled toilets shared with baby changing - easy to use and not far from anything in the park."
troqueer cemetery dumfries,positive,"The Commonwealth Graves can be accessed through the main gate which has a large carpark adjacent . Public bus service stops in the car park May also be accessed via the river path.  Older parts of the cemetery can be accessed via the main entrance to the church via the main road, some street parking available"
troxy london,negative,"The venue suggests you use public transport but incorrectly stated they are 200 metres from the dlr station (it is actually 400 metres). They have no parking facilities at all. They said you could be dropped at the venue whilst someone parks your car, the car parking they suggest is one stop away on the dlr. This is not necessarily helpful if you need your carer with you. So overall the journey was awful.  The toilets were passable, however the venue had lost their radar key when we arrived, luckily I had mine. The disabled loo was difficult to get in and felt a bit like a dumping ground. "
trump turnberry scotland turnberry,negative,"disabled parking is not bad, but car park and road is still getting work done at present.  "
tsb bank dumfries,positive,"I got wheelchair taxi into town, but street parking car parks nearby, dedicated disabled parking spaces nearby Public transport bust stop 2 minutes away"

tui holiday store elgin,positive,TUI arranged for us to drop of our car at Edinburgh airport.
tullie house museum art gallery trust carlisle,positive,Blue badge parking in the street outside Disabled toilets on all three floors.
tullie inn alexandria,negative,"The accessible toilet is also a baby change - not a problem in itself, but the changing platform would not stay up against the wall. While I was assisting my relative the platform was resting on my back. The toilet is on the small side. It might be difficult with a wheelchair and a carer.  There is a drop down rail on one side but the one attached to the wall on the other side was a bit too far away to be really useful. Sadly this is often the case with accessible toilets.  It was good to see the red cord went down to the floor.  The toilet is at the back of the bar - about as far away as possible from the pleasant glass area at the front of the restaurant. "
tullybannocher cafe crieff,negative,Rough carpark with no marked spaces. Used a lot by bikers. Dont think it's near any public transport. 
tullybannocher cafe crieff,positive,Great disabled toilet on main floor. We left a Euans Guide red cord card
tunbridge wells railway station royal tunbridge wells,positive,"There are disabled parking bays on the Morrisons side of the station close to the entrance, there is a dropped kerb near the station entrance door. There is also parking available in the Morrisons multi story car park, there are two disabled bays at entrance level, there is an automatic door and lifts that will take you into Morrisons where you can exit and cross the road to the station.   There is a taxi rank on the Mount Pleasant Road side of the station. Ringing ahead for an accessible taxi would be advisable as not all are accessible. Bus stops are also on this road."
tune hotel liverpool street london,negative,No parking. Liverpool street station is a short walk away but the pavements around the hotel are narrow and uneven. The underground at liverpool street is step free on one side only so on return journeys you must return to the same side of the track.
tune hotel liverpool street london,positive,Bedroom ensuite very big and there is a good size disabled toilet at reception.
tune hotel westminster london,negative,"About a 10 minute walk from Waterloo station, if you don't get lost, like I perhaps did ;). Not sure about bus routes. See pic"
tuppenhurst barn bb and cafe rugeley,positive,"Disabled spaces would give it 5 stars. The disabled toilet was immaculate.  No problems there, plenty of room for the chair, grab rails, the red emergency cord hung freely to the ground and there were clean hand towels for visitors as well as being very clean.  Alas no hoist and you have to share with babies but never mind, which would give it 5 stars. "
turner contemporary margate,positive,There are disabled spaces just outside the gallery.
turtle bay newcastle upon tyne,positive,"Perfect fit for a power chair, Radar key available from behind the bar"
tusitala edinburgh,positive,2 Spaces for blue badge holders
twa tams perth,positive,"Street parking, close to bus station and train station. Enough space to manouevre, very accessible."
twickenham stadium twickenham,positive,"Too many non-disabled people using loo Disabled parking for one vehicle is normally included with ""wheelchair package"" tickets. This is usually in the car park of the nearby Tesco, a short walk away from the stadium. The route from the car park to the stadium is not direct, and involves crossing roads and a bit of bumping up and down kerbs. And it's worth being aware that exiting the car park after a match may take some time! There are a number of accessible toilets situated around the stadium, and accessed via RADAR key. They are variable in size, shape and design. All those visited have drop-down rails and space for side transfer, though they could do with some updating and upgrading. There is likely to be a queue directly after the end of a match! There is also one (rather small) accessible toilet in the nearby Tesco store and during major events at the stadium a portable accessible toilet is often situated in the Tesco car park. On most recent visits there has been a Mobiloo parked on the stadium concourse - this has an accessible toilet with hoist and changing bench. The organisers have told me this will be a regular feature on match days."
two temple place london,negative,"Temple Place is near Temple tube, though this has lots of steps. Bus access is easier but means a bit more walking . Hand rail loose, bin overflowing, wet floor = trip hazards. Door hard to use."
two temple place london,positive,Disabled accessible toilet on the ground floor. It's quite spacious and there are grab rails. When I visited the emergency cord only reached midway down the wall and I informed the staff that it should reach the floor and they said they would follow that up.
twycross zoo atherstone,negative,"Easily accessible by car.  Disabled parking OK, however spaces are unmarked so poor parking quickly leads to a shortage in spaces. All generally unclean, and of the porta cabin variety.  Disabled facilities, shared with baby change so queues, impatient people  a problem.  No disabled changing. We managed to obtain a disabled parking place which was near to the entrance. Filthy and combined with baby changing so long ques Toilets ok with grab rails, etc, but doors too heavy and difficult to use with rollator/walker."
twycross zoo atherstone,positive,Plenty of parking.

tyne and wear metro newcastle upon tyne,negative,"Some, but not all, stations have wheelchair-accessible toilets. This can vary as the stations are widespread. I have not seen a toilet within a metro station yet."
tynecastle stadium edinburgh,negative,The disabled toilets are easy accessible with a couple of them available.
tynecastle stadium edinburgh,positive,"I went by taxi and it was easy - we stopped outside Tynecastle. There is an accessible toilet Tynecastle Stadium is located close to the West End of Edinburgh (Near Murrayfield rugby stadium) and can be located from there by taking the Dalry Road fork at Haymarket and continuing until Dalry Road joins Gorgie Road. From the Edinburgh City Bypass (A720), take the A71 Edinburgh West slip road and follow signs for City Centre. We were sitting in the Roseburn Stand which is located at the north end of the stadium. Access for wheelchair users is by the McLeod Street disabled gate. I have read many reviews of Tynecastle that says there is no parking for disabled supporters (Home and away support), but this is simply untrue. I emailed the Hearts disability access officer (Keith Ferguson) to ask where the best place for wheelchair users to park would be and he replied and said that he would be able to give me a space in the car park behind the away stand (car park is in the old school behind the Roseburn Stand). He told me that the street closed at 2pm sharp. He also told me to try and arrive at the gate between 1.30 and 2.00 when he would be on the gate and could make sure I get in OK. My tip would be, if you decide to visit Tynecastle to email Keith Ferguson by going on the Hearts website and clicking on club then contact us and select Disability access officer as your department you want to contact and to ask him about your parking options (It might be much different to my experience depending on the size of your club). However when we went to park, I was told that I wasn't on the list so I said that I had emailed Keith so it wasn't a problem. I would recommend this service to anyone who wishes to go to Tynecastle.   I had to ask the steward for a key to open the disabled toilet (ICTFC should take note). When inside the toilets are HUGE, it had everything that I needed and it was nice to see a proper red cord. Although, you can see by the photo that the railings was covered in rust or something else (You make your own mind up) but I wasn't going to check."
tynemouth aquarium north shields,positive,"There was a large carpark adjacent to the aquarium with a number of disabled parking bays close to the entrance to the aquarium, although we felt that these were not well signposted."
tynemouth longsands north shields,positive,2 dedicated parking bays right next to the sand. Other bays available also.  Buses and metro links a short distance from the beach too.
tyneside cinema newcastle upon tyne,negative,"Typical city centre parking, sometimes easy, sometimes difficult"
tyneside cinema newcastle upon tyne,positive,"I don't drive, so I don't know what the parking is like - but from a quick search, the nearest blue badge spaces are in Nelson Street and Nun Street. There is also good access via the metro; monument is the nearest stop, less than one minute walk away.   As I have a disabled bus pass, I went with my partner by bus. There is a direct bus that stops on the opposite side of the street directly opposite the cinema.  All accessible toilets had a changing place and had enough room for at least one carer to also be inside. To open the toilet, a radar key is needed and these toilets are on levels 1, 2 and 3 . They are extremely spacious and have lots of grab bars which can be easily reached and used due to their lightweight nature, and a red cord that hangs all the way down to the floor so again is easy to access. Toilets are easy to find as they are near the lifts on each floor as well as well signposted.  "
ubiquitous chip glasgow,negative,There is on street parking on Byres Road which is not far from the venue but this is an extremely busy street. The accessible toilet was small and did not have a changing table. Most with a mobility impairment would be able to manage ok. The lighting was also quite poor which might affect anyone with a visual impairment. The biggest issue for me was the toilet is accessed through the bar which is extremely tight an don a Saturday night was full. It took quite a while to make my way through the crowds. This was made far easier by the superb staff member who accompanied me.
ucl roberts engineering building london,positive,"Roberts Building at UCL is close to Euston Square tube, which has step free access only westbound. Euston, Warren Street and Goodge Street tube stations are also close by but access is limited.   There are several buses that stop nearby. There has been a recent change in some of the London bus routes and this means that buses that previously served Gower Street are now going down Tottenham Court Road. This means the bus stop is no longer as close as it used to be. This is disappointing as we seem to be going backwards with regard to bus access. Assessible toilet on the ground floor. Sorry I didn't take any photos and I can't remember the details. The toilet was spacious with grab rails, but I can't remember about the emergency cord."
ullapool museum ullapool,negative,"Street parking, is available right outside.  "
ullapool museum ullapool,positive,The toilet is on the ground floor and has a red pull cord. The sink will take a chair underneath and there are some toilet grab rails. There is space for a carer as well.
ullswater steamers ullswater,negative,There is disabled parking at a car park about a 5/10 minute walk from the entrance. There is a pavement all the way to the entrance so you can push a wheelchair there. The issue we had with our group is that if someone isn’t using a wheelchair but struggles with mobility it can be difficult. When we arrived back after the boat trip we brought the cars right outside to pick our group up but it is worth contacting the venue to check this is ok. There are disabled toilets where you get the boat from (Pooley Bridge) and to (Glenridding). However the toilets on board are below deck which is down some steps and they are not disabled toilets and are very small.

ulster museum belfast,positive,"I spent 20mins trying to find street parking, but if you have a blue badge there are 5 spaces inside the museum grounds at the entrance. If you haven't got a badge and walking is an issue, I advise you to get dropped off.  Museum is just past Queens University so catch a pink city bus to here and it's a short walk. Disabled loo is on ground floor just beside cafe. It could be quite a journey if you are on top floor & need to use facilities, so you might want to use them first before you start. There are so many interesting things to see here you wont want to rush away."
ultimate picture palace oxford,negative,This is the killer. The toilets are down a staircase below the stage. Absolute disaster for the disabled. There's a disabled loo in the locked church opposite & you might try George & Davis ice-cream over the road for a loo.
ultimate picture palace oxford,positive,"Blue badge spot directly outside, buses with disabled access on the Cowley Road. Reasonably accessible."
ulva ferry terminal isle of mull,negative,No disabled parking as such but plenty of room to park near the toilet.
uncle henrys farm shop   butchery cafe grayingham,positive,"There is car parking next to the shop and cafe building and there is disabled parking immediately next to the entrance. We visited the toilets, it was a standard disabled loo (ie no changing bench), there was a baby change unit with a maximum weight of 25kg which is what we used."
underbelly bristo square edinburgh,positive,I got the train into Edinburgh and used my scooter to get to the venue. Some areas are partially cobbled and due to hills it would be hard in a manual wheelchair. Busses and taxis are easy to access throughout the city. During the festival there are certain roads closed to cars so remember this. It is also VERY busy so give yourself extra time to get to venues. An excellent and well appointed toilet with an emergency bar all around the bottom of the wall rather than a red cord. High quality fixtures and fittings and plenty of time to transfer from a wheelchair on to the toilet. I was shown to it after asking where to find it.
underbelly george square edinburgh,negative,The 'disabled moo loos' in George Square were clearly signposted and situated beside the ladies and gents. There was a ramp to the toilet door but unfortunately the door opened out the way necessitating any wheelchair user to pull the door open while rolling back down the slope. The loo had grab rails and plenty of space inside. It also had a sharps box which was alarmingly open (but fortunately empty) when we were there. There was a disbled toilet but it was quite filthy and the sistern was broken so it wouldn't flush properly. Ther was no hand towel. I untied the red cord and added a red cord card.
underbelly george square edinburgh,positive,Parked in disabled on street parking Very good sized accessible loos that are located beside the bar and food kiosks outside the auditorium. 
union chapel london,negative,"Leave enough time to get there as parking is limited - there's no parking as such. I don't mind walking for 5 minutes or so but some might. Personally, I must be satisfied with the parking facilities as I've never travelled there by public transport but I hear links are good. Bear in mind though, that gigs finish around 22:30 so to get a train may be a little stressful at that time of night. I would certainly recommending going though, it's a great place. I reckon most manual wheelchair uses can get into the toilets. Others will struggle. I wouldn't class there to be an accessible toilet - there's no hoist. I perhaps have too much sympathy for the people and the venue but I don't know how many options they have to improve this"
union chapel london,positive,"The nearest tube is Highbury and Islington which only the Overground platforms are accessible. The nearest accessible tube is King's Cross. There are numerous buses that stop very close to the chapel. There is one accessible toilet, on the ground floor to the right of the stage and is signposted. It is spacious and clean with grab rails but no emergency alarm."
union square shopping centre aberdeen,positive,"There are plenty of parking bays outside the centre and there is an indoor car park too. The centre is attached to Aberdeen train station, so it’s very easy to get to by train.  Toilets were a little smaller than expected, but were clean and had everything I needed. I even found a Euan’s Guide red cord card inside the loo.  The Centre is attached to the station and is also handy for buses and taxis. It's also very close to the harbour for the ferry services. Plenty of accessible loos to choose from. There's even a loo with a changing bench and hoist near the bus station entrance!"
uniqlo london,positive,"Tottenham Court Road Station is near by and fully step-free but check before you travel because its lifts, which are new, are notoriously unreliable and often break down. Oxford Street has zillions of bus routes running along it. I wouldn't dream of parking in the West End, or if I did, it wouldn't be a dream, it would be a nightmare."
united states capitol washington,positive,We traveled on the metro and got off at a station that was only a short distance from the Capitol. Yes
unity kitchen cafe london,negative,We couldn't find the disabled parking. Info for the olympic park is bad. We ended up parking in a residential but which had reasonable access
universal studios hollywood universal city,positive,There was parking very close to the park gate and the route would be wheelchair accessible. Taxis can also get very close to the entry - I didn't notice public transport. Accessible toilets were available around the aprk
university college hospital grafton way building london,positive,"The bus stop is on Tottenham Court Road is a couple of minutes walk away. The nearest tube stations to the hospital are Euston Square, which is only step free westbound, and Warren Street. The nearest step free tube station is King's Cross. I used the accessible toilet in the Imaging Department. The nurse showed me where it was. On the door is an image of a man and a woman and a toilet. Written on the door is patient WC and underneath is signage in braille. There was nothing on the door to indicate it was an accessible toilet. However inside there was a brand new, spacious accessible toilet with grab rails and emergency cord. There were even coat hooks on at two different heights (sorry my photo chopped the coat hooks off). It was clean and tidy and a pleasure to use.   In the reception area there was one sign indicating an accessible toilet.   I noted that there were a separate baby changing and baby feeding areas. I mention it in this section, as often baby changing facilities are in the accessible toilet, and often I've been places where I have had to wait while the facilities were being used for baby changing or vice versa.     I feedback to reception about the lack of signage on the accessible toilet and she will follow that up  with her manager.  I also asked if they had a Changing Places toilet and staff didn't know what one was. So again I raised that."
university college hospital london,negative,"When I arrived at 1st floor surgical reception I was asked to provide a urine sample. There was no accessible toilet in the reception area where I was seated and a member of staff had to escort me through a locked door into Section D where there were accessible toilets. When I did get to the accessible toilet it was spacious and had grab rails and an emergency cord. Also when the staff had asked for a sample they handed me a test tube and seemed surprised when I said I couldn't manage that and required a cardboard pan, and then had to go and find me one.  When I was on T6 Gynae Ward, initially I had a catheter and then I used the assessible toilet on the ward which was spacious, had grab rails and 2 emergency cords. "
university college hospital london,positive,"The nearest tube stations to the hospital are Euston Square, which is only step free westbound, and Warren Street. The nearest step free station is King's Cross. There are also several buses that stop outside the hospital entrance on Euston Road.   The nearest tube stations are Warren Street, which is not step free, and Euston Square which is only step free westbound. The nearest step free tube stations are King's Cross or Tottenham Court Road. From either there are buses that will stop near by the hospital.  There are spacious accessible toilets with grab rails and an emergency cord. The toilets were clean and tidy. The nearest tube stations to the hospital are Euston Square, which is only step free westbound, and Warren Street. The nearest step free station is King's Cross. There are also several buses that stop outside the hospital entrance on Euston Road."
university dental hospital of manchester manchester,positive,I got the bus here and a taxi home because I finished at rush hour and don’t like busy busses. The bus stop was close by
university hospital wishaw wishaw,negative,"There are lots of spaces available  Too small, for a wheelchair, well the toilet I used "
university of derby derby,positive,The Derby Uni buses stop outside the main entrance.   There accessible parking bays near entrances.  Toilet in visitors waiting room is accessible even though the door doesn't say it is. Navy coloured grab rails around toilet and sink. Plenty of floor space.  The loo in the atrium isn't worth the effort if you're in a wheelchair as it is tiny.   No changing places facilities. 
university of dundee botanic garden dundee,positive,"large car park with  blue badge spaces. Easy to find. Grab rails. Adequate space for carer. Clean and tidy. There is also a much larger toilet on way to gardens which ha grab rails and is also always clean and tidy. Buses stop at the end of the drive and on Perth Road, 200 yards away. Improved car parking with three blue badge spaces and two car charging points.  Toilet with good circulation space, all required rails, good contrast for vision impairment. Lost a star as there is no emergency cord. "
university of east anglia norwich,positive,"The main carp ark has multiple accessible bays. Next to that is the main bus stop. The buses all have ramps and kneeling suspension and 1 wheelchair space. These both lie at the top of a hill looking down on man campus. If you are using a manual wheelchair you'll need to be quite fit to get up the hill. 3 accessible loos but can be a challenge to find. Loo on floor 01 (1st basement) next to the main lifts shaft, is small and narrow and not suitable if you need a carer. Although there are grab rails there isn't one that drops down beside the loo. Has an alarm cord and a mirror. 2 loos on floor 02 (2nd basement). One is in the old library down a series of corridors with powered doors. Its a reasonable size with grab rails, alarm cord and mirror. The second is in the newer part of the library round the corner from the new lift. Has foldaway light changing table. Good room, grab rails, alarm cord Main car park has quite a few disabled bays. Buses also stop next to car park. All Norwich buses are accessible with ramps and kneeling suspension, but usually with just one wheelchair space. Unfortunately both of these are at the top of a fairly steep slope with the main campus (including the Student Union) at the bottom of this slope. If you are a manual wheelchair user you will need to be pretty fit to get up it. The accessible loo off the bar (""Street Level"") is accessed using a RADAR key. Its a reasonable size with grab rails, alarm cord and mirror. There are two loos on the next floor up (""Walkway Level"") in between the gender neutral stalls. Newly refurbished they are bright and good contrasting colours between grab rails and walls. Alarm cord and mirrors. On the top floor a new accessible loo will be available from October 2016."
university of hull hull,positive,There were multiple disabled parking bays spread over the campus. WC toilets for disabled users are available and more are being created with hoists being put in place too.
university of lincoln lincoln,positive,"Number of parking spaces available on campus . Pre booking essential Most floors have disabled toilets, hoist and new changing room faculties noted main atrium.  Note coming out of lifts in chair bit scary as glass sides on walkway and no turning spaces."
university of oxford botanic garden oxford,negative,OK once you are in but gravel outside would be restrictive for a manual chair. Fine for space and cleanliness.
university of oxford oxford,negative,"For parking, check the Council website at https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20043/disability_and_accessibility. There's not much at some University buildings but blue badge holders can park in residents only bays as well as disabled bays on the roads. I didnt see any special parking. No special toilets."
university of oxford oxford,positive,This varies but most colleges and depts have an accessible loo now.
unorthodox roasters stirling,negative,Small. Red cord tied up. Once untied it was still a metre of the floor. Had to reverse out and one of the tables makes this quite tight. 
up at the o2 london,positive,"I reached the 02 through a combination of trains and underground- which serve London well. There are also buses. There is a website giving more information about accessible public transport in London. Large accessible toilet/changing area. Hoist and plinth. Nearest tube is Greenwich A dozen or so disabled spaces by Tube if you can nab one! If not, lots in car park 1. fully accessible"
urban cafe edinburgh,positive,Easy to find and I think should be easy to manoeuvre around. 
urban outfitters edinburgh,positive,Many buses stop on Princes Street as well as the trams. 
urquhart castle drumnadrochit,negative,"The castle’s visitor centre has its own car parking. You leave the main road and turn in to what at first looks like a lay-by. Sweeping further in you see a line of parking bays with some accessible ones just by the tower like entrance to the visitor centre. The tower is small and going inside you learn the mystery of its size as a handy life takes you down to a large visitor centre set in to the hillside over looking the castle and loch.  If you aren’t coming by car you can take a bus from Inverness as several of the buses will stop at the visitor centre on their journey along the loch side.  Some of the Loch Ness boat tours include a stop at Urquhart Castle where a wooden jetty sticks out in to the Loch and enables passengers to come ashore. Wasn't used byt clearly marked Very poor. There is disabled toilets but they are BOTH closed at the SAME time for refurbishment so there was no disabled toilets and when I asked the staff why the toilets were both shut, he said ""there is disabled toilets 2 miles into the town"" -_-"
urquhart castle drumnadrochit,positive,"Drove and parked right outside entrance in a disabled space. Arriving by car we were able to park our WAV (wheelchair accessible vehicle) in one of the accessible parking bays right out side the Visitor Centre entrance. The only tip we'd have about parking is to arrive early as the car parking can get very busy at times. The accessible toilets were adjacent to the gift shop area. They were ket locked but a steward was quick to step forward with the key and open the door for us. Large, clean and functional. Got parked in disabled space very close to entrance and ticket office.  These bays were coned of  to try to ensure blue badge holders only.  Helpful steward directed us to park There are accessible toilets adjacent to the shop. These were kept locked when we visited but stewards were quick to pop across and unlock them as required. They were sizeable and clean. Plenty of spaces and car park generally well laid out."
usher hall edinburgh,negative,"Only parking available is in the adjoining streets, via blue badge but patrons should be aware of residents parking, and the neighbouring Lyceum Theatre.  Buses are plentiful on the nearby Lothian Road. Not really suitable - small and difficult to get into. I was a bit confused about the place and couldn't find any accessible toilets except a very small one with a slim doorway, but I think in another review there was something about a bigger toilet! At the end there weren't really staff to say where to go, just that we had to leave the hall! The toilet was clean though."
usher hall edinburgh,positive,"Taxi rank available immediately out side.   Some disabled parking available on Grindlay Street. A number of accessible toilets available. Great. Not enough disabled parking. There is plenty parking nearby and also good bus links. I have only spotted one disabled toilet in the venue. There may be more, but I only know of one. If there is only one that would explain why it's also busy. There's an accessable loo near the accessable spots in the circle. It has its own door so no queing or trying to get passed other patrons. Perfect. I didn't come by car as I stayed nearby but I understand that there are disabled parking spaces available very nearby and meter parking without time limits.  The train station is a bit of a walk (or wheel) but doable and there are lots of buses available as well. The accessible toilet in the Grand Circle is very close to the disabled seating and it was clean and very spacious with lots of grab bars and well signposted.   There are disabled parking spaces in Cambridge Street just by Shakespeares bar (opposite the Traverse Theatre) but in festival time these get filled quickly.  Bus stop is just opposite the hall so very handy. Yes - large disabled toilet just opposite the dedicated disabled seating on the first floor.  Not sure what the toilets are like on the ground floor but expect they are similar. Remember it's a city centre, so is competition for spaces. Plenty of rails and room. Disabled parking spaces right outside.  The loo on the ground floor was huge. Loses half a mark for not having a changing places toilet.  Got the no 16 bus that stops right outside. Only got a glance at these - but they looked spacious and clean."
uss midway museum san diego,positive,Parking was near to the ship and taxis could stop right outside the reception
v rev vegan diner manchester,negative,There was an accessible loo downstairs. There was limited turning space due to a large bin.   Grab rails were around toilet and sink and were of a contrasting navy colour. The toilet seat was also navy.   The flush handle was small. The sink had a lever tap and the door handle lock was large. 
v21 sbectrwm community enterprise centre cardiff,positive,Lots of disabled spaces but always well used. Large car park. Several accessible loos. Large 'Changing places' toilet now open. (Radar key required)
va dundee dundee,positive,"Ample parking all around the museum with modernised mainline rail station on other side of road. Bus routes close by. Easy to find and ample space. We parked in the small carpark beside Discovery Point which is free for blue badge holders . The train station is opposite the museum  Excellent disabled toilets on ground and second floors. Already had Euans Guide red cord cards! The train is just across the road.  Which is quite a walk if you have Mobility issues. The car park is about the same distance. There are 6 accessible parking spaces right outside the V&A, however there are only a few normal parking spaces along with the accessible ones. These are public spaces though so the V&A cannot guarantee one will be available.    Within a 10-minute walk from the V&A there are 4 council car parks in every direction, blue badge holders can park here for free.  Dundee’s newly opened train station is directly across the road from the V&A, which has a taxi rank beside it. The bus station is a 10-minute walk away from the V&A, there’s also plenty of bus stops nearby due to being situated in the city centre.  The accessible toilet on the ground floor and second floor of the V&A is very spacious, however the toilets are close to one side of the room, so you can only transfer from one side. A great facility that the V&A has is a Changing Places toilet!!! It is a massive accessibility toilet including all typical features, as well as a ceiling tracking hoist and a soft changing bench. The Changing Place toilet is on the first floor of the V&A which can be accessed by the lift beside the main entrance. Although the V&A closes around 5pm, the Changing Place toilet will be open until around 10pm whilst the restaurant is still open.  I arrived by train. The station is conveniently located for visiting the V&A. Parking is also available nearby next to RRS Discovery."
va museum of childhood london,negative,I used the London Underground which varies with accessibility. Sometimes trains have problems which means there are steps to negotiate which are a nightmare.
vac halifax,negative,"There are two spaces at the front for Disabled but they can be full,plus the other spaces you are limited on hours to park "
vac halifax,positive,No issues there well thought out 
vagina museum london,positive,"The nearest tube stations are Camden Town and Chalk Farm, both of  which do not have step free access. The nearest accessible tube station is King's Cross. Alternatively you could use Tottenham Court Road tube and get the number 24 to Hartland Road/ Camden Market stop, which is close to the entrance of the market.  The are a number of buses that travel between Camden High Street and Chalk Farm which stop near Camden Market. There are no toilets in the museum. Staff at the information desk will assist with providing directions to the nearest accessible toilet, see photo of the map. The toilet is located in another building so it means going outside again. The nearest accessible toilet is 1 - 2 minutes away from the museum. See my photos of the route. On exiting the museum turn left and at the end of the alleyway where Dr Matens is turn left again. Walk towards the archways directly in front of you and there you will see a sign for the accessible toilet. Turn right, go up a slight slope and then a further short slope. Almost immediately after you will see a wide entranceway on your right, see photo. Turn right into here and make towards the lifts on your right hand side. Take the lift to the basement and turn right, and the accessible toilet is immediately next to the lift.   The accessible toilet requires a RADAR key and there is a notice on the door saying how to contact a member of staff if you don't have your own. The toilet was quite spacious, it was clean with grab rails and an emergency cord which only hung three quarters of the way down.  The Vagina Museum's website gives the location of the Camden Society, as being the nearest Changing Places toilet. However, recently the Wellcome Collection has opened a Changing Places toilet and this is a short bus ride and walk away. "
valeries tearoom whitley bay,negative,We parked a little way away from Valerie’s as we wanted to enjoy the walk along the spotlessly clean prom so wasn’t aware of nearby parking.  There is no parking immediately next to Valerie’s .
valeries tearoom whitley bay,positive,Beautifully clean and spacious . Located on the first floor
valley gardens harrogate,positive,"There are a number of disabled toilets; one situated in the playground and another near the main toilets, these are quite hard to find.  From a glance they seemed to be clean and included grab rails but seemed quite small inside. Huge car park located around the corner with accessible parking spaces. There is also busses and trains that come into Harrogate town centre and pass Valley Gardens.  There are clean Harrogate Council accessible toilets located on Valley Gardens. "
valley view restaurant   carnon downs garden centre the beeches,negative,"The garden centre and restaurant is wheelchair accessible and there are a few disabled parking spaces within close proximity to the entrance and exit of the garden centre. Without driving it would be possible to get to the garden centre although it would involve walking 200m or so from the nearest bus stop so driving would be preferable if the option is available. The walk would have a small section where there is no pavement so walking on the road would be unavoidable. There is  a disabled toilet with pull cord in case of emergencies tucked around the corner of the café. Sign clearly shown on the door however it seems that people prefer to use the disabled one instead of the normal ones due to cleanliness of the latter. The toilets could do with a remodel soon to stop this occurring in future, and signs throughout the garden centre indicating location of the toilets would be a benefit."
van gogh museum amsterdam,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. We got there by tram from Amsterdam Centraal Station - trams 2 and 5 will get you very close to the museum - the stop is called Van Baerlestraat. There's no mention of dsabled parking on the museum website. There is an underground car park under Museumplein, and it appeared to have lift access, but we didn't use it.  Excellent - spacious, clean, well-equipped with grab rails, plenty of room to side transfer if you wish, and those wonderful Dutch alarm cords which stretch horizontally around the room just above floor level, so that the alarm cord could be reached wherever a user happened to fall. Can we have more of those in the UK, please? There is an underground Q-park parking garage not far from the museum with accessible parking and an elevator.  Taxis can also drop you off fairly close to the museum.  To simplify things, the company Accessible Travel Netherlands can arrange taxis for you.  If going by public transport, be sure to call ahead to ensure all the trams are wheelchair accessible. There is an accessible toilet on the main level."
vangarde shopping park huntington,negative,"I purposely park in a blue badge area that is right outside the main entrance of the food hall of M&S. There are other blue badge parking bays, but they are too far from main entrances for me."
vangarde shopping park huntington,positive,"The accessible loos in M&S are perfect (especially with the added Euan's guide 'red cord emergency' cards. The loos in other venues (eg Cafe Nero and Giraffe restaurant) are good but have small things to change to make them perfect too - for example, pedal-powered bins - a bugbear of mine. "
vapiano edinburgh,positive,"A tram stop is nearby on St Andrew’s Square, buses on Princes Street and Edinburgh Waverley Train Station nearby. The accessible toilet is huge, I could do doughnuts in my wheelchair! There a only two bins which really makes a difference too. Great public transport links, close to tram, bus and Waverley Station. There is also parking available in St Andrews Square and on George Street. At the very bottom of the restaurant, the accessible toilet is in between the ladies and men's toilets, so watch out for doors opening either side of you as you enter and exit the loo. It's a great sized toilet, very clean and with a good length emergency cord. Half a star dropped for its location at the very bottom of the restaurant, reached by lift or two sets of stairs. "
vatican city rome,negative,There are various toilets dotted around The Vatican  - just ask.
vecchia bologna bridge of allan,negative,No disabled parking.
vedi derby,positive,There is on street parking outside the building which is free for blue badge holders. There are two bays saved for disabled badge holders.   The bus station is about 10 minutes walk away at a moderate pace.   The pavement is smooth with plenty of flush lowered kerbs and there are crossings on busy main road to get from Intu to Vedi.
veggie master derby,negative,"Parking isn't great. Nearest car park is Grove Street which doesn't have any decent accessible bays. The only bay was one slightly larger, painted in white with no marked out areas with word disabled in it. The car park, like all Derby council owned car parks, isn't free for the disabled unless you're on high rate mobility DLA (not PIP) and have a permit.   The pavements are terrible at minute too as the council are doing road works so large areas are blocked off. "
ventnor botanic garden ventnor,positive,"Bus stop nearby but the buses are hourly and irregular. Recommend you visit by car Large flat and smooth car park. Designated blue badge parking (free) plus electric car charging point.  2 accessible toilets (one in the downstairs cafe, one in the upstairs cafe)  Plenty of room to manoevre in the upstairs toilet with a single handrail. The accessible toilet upstairs is the only one provided for all patrons. I did not use the toilet downstairs so cannot comment  "
venue cymru llandudno,positive,"The Venue Cymru carpark facilities include disabled spaces.  However, for anyone not coming by car, the theatre is a fair walk from the centre of Llandudno / most of the hotels. Clean toilet facilities for the disabled, with handrails, etc."
verdant works dundee,negative,"The toilet I saw was a little tight for space and I couldn't see an emergency cord, but it was very clean and brightly lit. We travelled from the town centre to Verdant works, around a 10/15 minute journey. Some of our group walked and some used a wheelchair and power chair. Difficult to access and curbs on pavements surrounding the location are quite high.  Narrow roads, uneven pavements and cars parked on the side of the road made it difficult to get to the museum. The members of our group using a wheelchair or power chair often had to travel on the road.  The journey to the museum would be easier via car and parking near the location. "
veritas leeds,negative,"There is some car parking available down the road but this tends to be full, so a blue badge may be needed to park on double yellow lines. There is a bus stop very close by, and the train station is also nearby. The pavement is slightly sloped but relatively smooth, but unfortunately only has one curb drop nearby which can make crossing the road, particularly at peak times, very difficult. The disabled bathroom is through a manual door to one side of the bar; on the left is the disabled stall, and on the right the steps leading down to the other toilets. The disabled cubicle needs a radar key, which can be obtained from the bar if you don’t have one yourself. The bathroom itself has grab rails and emergency pull cords, but is very small and difficult to manoeuvre larger, powered wheelchairs around."
vicarage road watford,positive,"My Dad and I drove and arrived early so may have missed the majority of the traffic. It is in a residential area, which means there aren't many routes out of the stadium. This didn't bother me as much as it could of done - we saw a good game with many highlights to chat about!  There's a car park with good number of spaces at the bottom of the lane, to the left of the club shop. This is 30secs from where we watched the game and there was no great cram to her in. You see: there' are benefits to the stadium being so tightly packed. Once you're there, you're there: you don't have to wander around endlesssly to try and locate everything. The toilets were perfectly adequate for me. I had no difficulties - and as I say they'll have there Changing Places toilet up and running quicker than you can say antidisestablishmentarianism (by there next home game, I believe). If you require a hoist, you're safest bet is to ask for a seat close to this. And EG are going to send them cards from the Red Cord Campaign, too!"
victoria and albert museum london,negative,"Several bus routes will drop you off just outside. The nearest tube station is South Kensington, which is totally non-step-free and completely useless to a wheelchair user. The nearest step-free station is Earl's Court, which is 1¼ miles away. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area."
victoria and albert museum london,positive,"I have visited by car using one of the 12 blue badge parking spaces in the middle of Exhibiton road. I have also come by train and taxi via Waterloo station. The taxi fare is around £10- £12 each way. There are accessible toilets on levels 0 to 4 which are all large with light weight doors. The sinks, hand dryers and toilet flushes are all set at the correct height. The only  negative is the lack of a disabled toilet next to the cafe. The nearest tube station South Kensington is not step free. Although the Piccadilly, District and Circle line stop there all the platforms involve steps to the ticket office hall level and then further steps to street level. This is really disappointing. There are a number of buses that stop outside or near to the V and A. I would suggest picking up bus no 14 from Green Park which is an step free station.  There is an large accessible toilet to the left when entering the main entrance, by the lift. It was spacious with grab rails and emergency cord (sorry no photo). London, buses are always no real drama in my experience.  The nearest tube station South Kensington is not step free.

There are a number of buses that stop outside or near to the V and A. I would suggest picking up bus no 14 from Green Park which is an step free station.

There are a number of buses that stop outside or near to the V and A. I would suggest picking up bus no 14 from Green Park which is an step free station.  There is accessible toilets. These are spacious with grab rails and emergency cords. I think there are accessible toilets on all floors, but I only used the one by the Cromwell Road entrance. This is very much near the start of the exhibition - good accessible toilet, make sure you go before you go in as it would be a bit tricky going back. Plenty of good accessible toilets in many places throughout the museum. The ground floor one, near the main entrance, sometimes has no water supply to the handbasin, I've reported this to staff a few times and they are always very concerned and friendly about it, so if you find problems, report them to a member of staff. One recurring problem with the accessible toilets is that the red emergency cord has been tucked away out of reach. This is dangerous and thoughtless. The red emergency cord must hang freely all the way to the floor at all times, so that it can be reached by anyone who falls over and needs to summon assistance. Tucking it away out of reach is putting people's safety - and possibly even their lives (in the case of serious injury following a bad fall) - at risk. "
victoria art gallery bath,negative,Some on street disabled parking near the venue but we used the Park & Ride with very accessible and frequent buses.
victoria hotel forres,negative,There is a train station less than 10 minutes from the venue and a bus stop less than 5 minutes away. There is also reasonable parking at the site however no designated disable parking. 
victoria palace theatre london,negative,The theatre is really close to Victoria train station but there's loads of roadworks so it's chaos.  However we used a taxi from Paddington station and this was a great way to travel and the driver found a really good place to drop us off.
victoria palace theatre london,positive,As on the day I visited there was engineering works and hence no trains to Victoria so I travelled by train to Waterloo and took a taxi. The disabled toilet was next to the side level entrance to theatre and it had a folding door which gave easy access to a clean and reasonably spacious toilet. At the interval we were shown to the toilet by a member of the access team. Floor length emergency cord in a good location. We traveled to the theatre by train from Clapham Junction to Victoria station.Wheelchair users should use a ramp to get on and off of the train.  It is necessary to inform a member of staff at the station if you need to use a ramp .   Once that Victoria station we walked approximately 0.2 miles to get to  Victoria Palace Theatre .  A member of staff pointed out a  disabled toilet as we entered the theatre. I did not use it but could see in from the outside and it looked relatively spacious and had grab rails.  I had intended on taking a photo when we were  leaving but unfortunately the toilet was occupied. . Really clearly signed and clean and spacious. Victoria tube station is right next toit and it is accessible.
victoria park glasgow,positive,"there is plenty of on street parking surrounding Victoria Park. there are plenty of portaloos, including accessible ones."
victoria park stadium dingwall,negative,Limited amount of disabled spaces which are first come first served and are directly opposite the stadium main entrance. The road  to the ground gets closed by police a half hour before kickoff so need to be parked prior to that. There is an accessible cubicle within the main toilets. I can't really judge it on this occasion as I was late but I have been here before so I know that there are a few disabled parking spaces for away fans.  Dingwall train station is 5 minutes away and I would recommend getting the train.  The toilets are easily accessible and very spacious.
victoria shopping centre harrogate,negative,"There is a lot of parking available however this is difficult to navigate as the shopping center parking is not directly linked, it is the other side of the railway station and you would have to use the lift within the car park to take you to the floor that has the over road bridge to the shopping center. There is a car park opposite the shopping center on ground level with disabled parking spaces however the car park is small and busy and therefore difficult to park some times. There is a bus station and railway station opposite the shopping center and they both have disabled access and accommodate for wheelchair users. "
victoria shopping centre harrogate,positive,"There are toilets on the second level which are sign posted including disabled access, there are also toilets on ground level however these can only be accessed outside, on the side of the shopping center. There are grab rails within the disabled access toilets and they are spacious however they do not include advanced technology such as hoists."
victoria theatre halifax,positive,Dedicated disabled toilet near the side entrance. Staff seem to guard this at interval to stop everyone using it. Disabled toilet is clean and well maintained.
victorian times paignton,negative,There is no accessible toilet and the toilet they have is up a short flight of stairs.
victorian times paignton,positive,"The tea rooms are located in Paignton town centre, a few minutes walk from the sea front. There is excellent public transport. Paignton railway station is step free and many buses stop close by.  "
victorias secret glasgow,negative,We parked a little while away behind Buchanan street. There are some blue badge spaces dotted around the city centre but you have to be lucky to catch one. There is also multi-storey parking available nearby
vieux nice nice,positive,Buses and trams stop in the vicinity but it will involve a short walk. Approaching from the sea front is a level walk. I didn’t use it but I saw a sign for toilets including an accessible toilet at Cours Saleya. I walked passed it and notice there was a 0.50 euro charge. 
viewpoint san nicolas granada,negative,"I would not recommend doing the climb on your scooter or in a wheelchair. It’s steep with lots of cobbles and takes ages.  To avoid most of the cobble stones, a taxi is probably your best option. The streets are restricted to taxi and authorised people only it should be able to drop you immediately next to the viewpoint. There are still cobbles to overcome but they’re tightly packed.  You can take the bus from and back to the city centre (C31, C32 or C34). They´re accessible by ramp with a wheelchair parking area onboard. The driver may not speak English but they are usually very helpful. The ramp got stuck on the bus I took and he helped me to get the scooter and me off the bus without it. This was not expected so I think I was just really unlucky on that occasion.   As access to roads up there are restricted, I don’t know how you would get close to park. I didn’t see any car parks on the way.  I didn’t find an accessible toilet."
vikingar largs,positive,There are three disabled parking spaces available in the Vikingar car park There are disabled toilets available within Vikingar The toilets have handrails however the toilets are quite small and cramped with little space to move. There are disabled parking spaces available outside the Vikingar centre it is also possible to walk along the prom from the train station . There are 2 accessible toilets one on the ground floor and one upstairs beside the gymnasium. Both toilets are small but have handrails  Vikingar can be accessed using car bus or train. I have used the car and the train The train station is a fair distance to walk but there are disabled parking spaces at the front of the centre. Toilets are in main reception area and upstairs beside the gym. Both have handrails and are quite small inside. They are manageable with assistance. Both toilets seats are quite low down to the ground. Both have red cords
villa athena peyia,negative,Grab rails on request for the toilets. Not wheelchair accessible so I have marked as 3 star
villa athena peyia,positive,"Cy-Breeze car hire met us at the airport with a much needed friendly face.  Car was just outside arrivals hall. Much easier than other companies who park in nearby fields, so you have to go stand in sun and wait for a minibus (not for me). The villa itself was perfect for us and the pool was warm and inviting and the car even had its own shaded area! You can use your Blue Badge in Cyprus."
villa carpe diem maroni,positive,"Lots of parking at the villa all on block paving so no issues when using a wheelchair. I would recommend renting the WAV or a car for non disabled people. The village is only 10 minutes away in the wheelchair. There is no public transport. Lots of space in the Loo plenty of room to maneuver a powered wheelchair. Everything in the one room a wash hand basin, toilet, shower and a bath also a commode shower chair. Still room for a power-chair and a portable hoist if needed. Photos on the website will show the layout of the room. A standard toilet with drop-down bars, also a toilet raiser so all sizes catered for with the commode shower chair going over the toilet. The shaded carport adjacent to the accessible flat works very well. The wet room and loo is spacious and well equipped. "
villa ephrussi de rothschild saint jean cap ferrat,negative,There was a ground floor accessible toilet in the villa. I went in and found it spacious but it did not have any grab rails. I went out again thinking I must have gone in the wrong toilet but when I checked at the receiption desk they seem surprised that I expected an accessible toilet to have grab rails. Sorry I was so annoyed I didn't  go back in to photograph it and I had to wait till I got back to Nice before I could go to the toilet. 
villa ephrussi de rothschild saint jean cap ferrat,positive,"The bus number 15 from Nice stops outside the entrance to the villa grounds.   From Nice take the bus 15 from Promanade des Arts opposite Théâtre National de Nice. This is near Modern and Contemporary Art Museum (MAMAC). The bus costs 1.50 euros (2020) and from Nice city centre it took about 45 minutes. The bus also serves Nice Port. The bus drops you off at the stop called ""Passable - Rothschild"", which is opposite the entrance to the villa grounds. On the way it is on the same side as the villa. See photos. There is also a car park in the villa grounds."
villa timily poli crysochous,positive,"Park in private drive, level access to house. If you don't want to drive and there are disabled people in the group, then I don't have any hesitation in recommending C & A taxis in Polis. They have minibuses with lifts in the back and passengers who can't leave their wheelchairs, are anchored to the floor. It costs approx. £140 for a return journey and takes 45 minutes from Paphos airport. When you have to leave your villa, they will collect your luggage and you can either go to C & A when you are ready, and their whole family is very welcoming. Level access to wide door wet room with grab rails and flip down shower seat. On request, a self propelling shower chair/commode. Moveable hoist hire, pool hoist"
villa zoe puerto del carmen,negative,"Only 1 accessible bathroom due to narrow doors, need to be able to manoeuvre manual wheelchair to gain access"
villa zoe puerto del carmen,positive,Parking available directly outside property
village de noel nice,positive,"Village de Noel, Christmas market is held in Albert 1'er gardens, which is adjacent to Place Massena, Nice's main square, and Promenade du Paillon, park, where the main Christmas lights are. This area can be easily reached by accessible buses or tram, which stop very close by.   In the Old Town, known as Vieux Nice, there is an animated nativity scene in the square outside the Cathedrale Sainte-Reparate in Place Rossetti. Most of Vieux Nice is pedestrianised, there is a maze of streets, and its shopping area where visitors go is mostly flat. Buses and trams stop in the vicinity but it will involve a short walk. Approaching the cathedral from the sea front is a level walk.   Maison Auer, an old fashioned chocolate shop, is directly opposite Nice’s Opera House, 7 Rue Saint-François de Paule, and buses and trams stop nearby.  I didn't use the toilets but there were public accessible toilets in the Christmas market and in Cours Saleya, in the flower market in Vieux Nice. The toilets were 0.5 euros. It seems where there are public toilets there are accesible toilets."
village glasgow glasgow,positive,"There are 15 clearly marked disabled parking bays at the front entrance, each has lines to the side and front. There are signs up to show these areas. The website says it is close to train stations and bus stops There is an accessible toilet in the foyer which is easy to get in and out off. It is quite long, there is space to turn, there’s a call button and red cord. There are grab rails and its always clean and tidy Easy to drive there and lots of free parking. It is level from the car park, into the hotel. Not sure about public transport  Large accessible toilet in the reception. Plenty space to move around."
village leeds south morley,positive,"Close to the M62 with numerous disabled parking bays adjacent to the front door. Entry from car Park to reception is level. The disabled loo in reception is good but, turning in my powerchair, to lock the door is tight. The loo is very clean and well equipped with drop down support rails and grab handles. There is space on the right as you face the toilet for a  wheelchair to transfer, with enough room for a carer to assist.  Staff are aware of the need for the red alarm cord to hang freely to the floor. With 15 disabled spaces spread on either side of the entrance and also immediately opposite it could not be better. An excellent disabled loo near to the restaurant and bar area. It has numerous grab rails and alarm chord but it is a little tight for my power chair.  Cleanliness is first class."
village maidstone maidstone,positive,"Plenty of disabled spaces which do not seem to be abused so parking is always easy The toilet itself is good but it's down a long corridor and the doors are heavy and not automatic,  somebody always gets it for me but is not by any means a guarantee"
village manchester ashton ashton under lyne,positive,Parking right outside building and clearly marked out bays. 
village solihull solihull,negative,"Not an easy place to find as our sat NAV did not register where it was, so had to find own way here, which took some time. It’s not well signposted, and in the middle of our newly built housing estate."
village urban resort blackpool,negative,Parking was good as there were accessible parking bays. Spoilt somewhat by guests vehicles intermittently blocking the only dropped kerb access to the front of the hotel. The hotel complex has a fairly long drive before reaching the main road so quite a distance to walk for buses. Taxis do come into the resort and drop off at the door. There are two publicly accessible toilets in the complex. One was fine and the other out of order.
village urban resort edinburgh,positive,The Village has a modern look and feel with wide walkways to the front and side and level access from the parking areas or the footpath to the main road where bus connections can be made.  The entrance to the Village Hotel is on the western side of the building and vehicles can drop off or pickup guests from the door. The main door is wide and automated as you approach it. An accessible toilet is available on the ground floor and is to the left of the approach to the Leisure Complex. As a visually impaired person I use public transport. Buses go from the Princes Street past the hotel as many are going to the nearby hospital.  A taxi ride from town takes around fifteen minutes. There are loads of accessible car parking bays outside the front door. A large accessible toilet is next to the reception area.
vindolanda hexham,positive,"Ask to drive back and park right at the museum for best wheelchair access. There are car parks, but they are far away and a very steep incline so best to park right at the museum in  back parking lot. Plenty of room to navigate and plenty of grab bars and private sink. Good parking and enteaces. Good to have the additional option of moving the car to museum so all options are available. Easy access and well located No problem getting a blue badge space in the car park. There's a loo by the entrance at the top of the site, but I used the one in the museum at the bottom. This, when I eventually got into it, was large and clean with good rails, but the door was a bit too automated for its own good! A touch pad outside is supposed to show when the loo is occupied or free, and then you tap the pad to open the door. After waiting a very long time (taking into account that wheelchair users like myself tend to be slow in the loo) I began to suspect that the loo wasn't actually occupied and the electronic lock display was faulty. It turned out I was right, and it took some effort by two members of staff to get the loo open for me.  "
vine inn cumnor,positive,Large carpark next to the pub This rating is not for the toilets inside the pub (don't know if there is an accessible one or not) but for the public Changing Places toilet next to the carpark.
virgin active health club edinburgh,positive,"Apparently it's on two levels - one on the club level and the other on the next level up. The club is all on one level and there is one disabled toilet opposite the class studios, and one containing a disabled shower in the ladies' changing room."
virgin active health club nottingham,positive,"Plenty of parking close to the entrance, and three dedicated parking spots for blue badge users. You can park here for free for up to 4 hours, but if you need more time you just sign your car in at reception. This gym is also just a stones throw away from Nottingham train station, making it the perfect place to go if you're travelling via train."
virgin money street events   edinburgh festival fringe edinburgh,positive,I didnt use it but it was accessible and there were volunteers to help if needed I am sure this could have been requested on Welcome as well if they knew you were coming.
vision pharmacy derby,negative,Limited parking but there are several buses.
visit scotland edinburgh,negative,Apart of  doors opening  inside which likely may cause problems - space wise is not too bad.
visit scotland edinburgh,positive,Allocated disabled parking spaces right outside the entrance. Multiple bus links going to Ocean Terminal which is over the road.
visitor centre tea shop compton,positive,"There are three disabled spaces in the car park, closest to the tear room. These are clearly marked. We drove but apparently buses pass here as there's a bus stop virtually outside. I've taken off half a star only because the car park is gravel and some may find that a bit hard to walk or wheel on, but it's not deep gravel and it's not very far across the car park from the disabled spaces. Loo was round the back outside but through a lobby. If there was signage, I didn't see it.  The separate assisted loo is well equipped. Only negatives are that you have to go outside to reach it and pass through a lobby (extra doors to negotiate). "
visitscotland office glasgow,positive,It was particularly good for access to public transport as they were bus stops immediately outside and it's only a short walk to the train station is both Queen Street and Central. Plenty of taxis were in evidence as they passed by the door frequently.
vittoria on the bridge edinburgh,positive,Very close to public transport links. The restaurant is located on George IV Bridge so a short distance from Waverley Station and near bus stops as well Yes there is an accessible toilet on site  There is parking a available on Chambers Street if you are lucky enough to get it and you can use your blue badge. Buses also drop off on Chambers Street. There is also a taxis rank across the road from restaurant. Dedicated large disabled toilets.
vittoria on the walk edinburgh,negative,"Parking outside on Brunswick Street is possible but you'll be lucky to get a space! Lots of buses going up and down Leith Walk, and a taxi an park right outside."
vittoria on the walk edinburgh,positive,Quite small (but at least the door opens outwards). The baby changing table gets in the road a bit.
voco oxford thames oxford,positive,"You are able to park up quite close to entrance for hotel, in one of the three disabled bays, and a brick pathway will lead you into the hotel itself. We arrived after by-passing Oxford, driving along a well tendered parkland of tall trees that lined the drive, and parked up very close to the hotels entrance, where three disabled bays await you. A delightful brick paved path leads you towards the lovely entrance, and you know by now you are going to enjoy your visit here."
voco st johns solihull,negative,"We found ordinary toilets which were nice and clean, but cubicles were rather narrow, so had to leave wheelchair outside and walk in, however, by chance we did see disabled toilet later on near to reception desk, but a bit late then."
voco st johns solihull,positive,"Easy enough to find along town streets, but a drab and tired looking car park awaited, with three disabled bays close enough to main entrance with a ramp available to get into hotel."
vodka revolution sheffield,positive,Devonshire car park is just across the road and parking is free for blue badge holders. There is a drop off point outside the bar entrance too.  Bus and tram stops are just a couple of minutes away. Very good disabled toilet to the left of the bar on the ground floor.
volksoper vienna,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Our tram got us to within seven minutes of the Volksoper, and it was an uphill push. Trams 40, 41 & 42 get you from Schottenring, on the edge of the city centre, to a stop a couple of minutes from the Volksoper. There is a U Bahn station (Währingerstraße-Volksoper) just across the road from the Volksoper. It's on Line U6."
vose farm holiday cottages truro,positive,definitely need your own transport as the farm is in a remote area.  details here: https://www.vosefarmcottages.co.uk/
vox cinema kuwait city,positive,"The Mall which the cinema is located in, has various parking lots each with plenty of disabled parking spots right in front of the mall entrance which is very convenient for the individuals using the space. Once inside the mall, elevators can be found almost everywhere and an elevator can be taken to reach the cinema on the top floor.  All the toilets have a disabled loo, which is spacious and has grab rails with its own private sink. The wheelchair can move around easily without feeling tight or inclosed and if a carer is needed there would be enough space for two people. The grab rails by the toilet make it easier for the individuals to support themselves  when independently using the toilet. The accessible toilets are always the cleanest. "
vue cinema barrow in furness,positive,good good
vue cinema edinburgh,negative,"Not brilliant, apart from the large taxi rank by ""The Playhouse"" next door.  Public transport is good with regular buses to nearby Princes Street & Leith Walk. (Personally, I came by taxi and my friend - who lives in Bonnyrigg, by bus.)`"
vue cinema edinburgh,positive,"The car park was good but a bit steep to get the wheelchair out. It was easy to access but it needs more space. Parking is super easy there is a Car Park attached to Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre and there are dedicated Blue Badge spaces. If travelling by bus, loads of Lothian buses stop at Ocean Terminal and they are all wheelchair accessible. These are excellent - modern, clean, roomy, accessible and easily found.` Multi-storey car park so protected from the weather."
vue cinema glasgow,negative,Parking wasn't so good all spaces were taken by non blue badge holders
vue cinema glasgow,positive,Used the loo that's upstairs but had no loo roll but was very clean
vue cinema halifax,positive,"Parking is located within Broad Street Plaza, and has disabled parking spots. The car park has lifts which enable you to go from the car park to the ground floor of the Plaza, where the entrance to the cinema is located. "
vue cinema inverness,positive,"There are a few disabled car parking spaces about a 100 metre walk to the entrance of the cinema. There are two disabled toilets, one right outside the cinema and one in the main reception. I think that the disabled toilets are both big and spacious so you have plenty of room to move around. Very good in my opinion."
vue cinema leeds,negative,"more than one available, reasonable size. There are times I have been when there is no disabled parking spot as there are other businesses/entertainment  in the same area and some people use the cinema disabled bays."
vue cinema leeds,positive,parking bays within 50m of entrance. Bus stops 100m away from major routes.
vue cinema london,negative,"There is parking at Westfield, and it is possible to arrive step-free on the Jubilee or DLR lines. Beware of the maze leading you out of Stratford Station. If you've come by Jubilee Line, you are likely to end up at the two lifts at the foot of the staircase leading to the bridge to Westfield, and these lifts are dreadful. One was out of order when I visited, the other was hugely over-full. I queued for 20 minutes to use it. As so often when venues are run by ignorant staff, the red emergency cord had been tied up out of the reach of anyone who might fall to the floor and need it. Disgraceful. A rubbish bin had been put in the wheelchair transfer area. In other respects this toilet was OK."
vue cinema stirling,positive,If u travel by car there are several disabled parking spaces just outside. If you are traveling by train you will need to cross over a bridge but there is lift access if you can't use the stairs then just a 5 minute walk from bridge to cinema. If you are traveling by bus the closest stop is right across from the cinema with low kurbs It is very easy to find and very big. It is very clean and lots of space for help if needed. There are rails to help. There is lowered pavements so a wheelchair can get up and there is a lot of clear disabled parking which most people respect!
vue cinema york,positive,The venue is located at Clifton moor centre with a public bus top nearby and several disabled parking spaces.
vue cinemas doncaster,negative,Excellent parking facilities & regular bus service
vue cinemas doncaster,positive,Excellent
vue cinemas edinburgh,negative,Loos on level of screen - pretty tight and usually stinking from the nappy bin. Have only ever been dropped off outside the venue. No parking for anyone outside the venue but there is a car park under the venue. I haven’t used it but there will be a lift to the main level. I assume there will be designated disabled parking in the car park. Drop off point just outside the venue and level entry to the venue from the street
vue cinemas edinburgh,positive,"Lots of Blue Badge spaces in each inside car park and directions to cinema clearly signed. Lifts at each car park and level access from there to the venue. Bus stops outside the building (flat access). Ask taxi to drop you at ""the outside car park where Debenhams used to be"" and you'll enter the building with the lift straight ahead of you. Very easily accessible toilets. Good entrance. Large space so easy to use for wheelchair or mobility scooters as there is turning space. Ample room for a career. Plenty of rails to help and sink, drier at an appropriate height.. very clean and checked regularly. There are several bike racks out the front of the building, and three bus stops nearby with shelter and seating. One is just a few yards from the Vue, while the other two are across the road. The nearby carpark is connected to the Omni Centre via a tunnel with access to an elevator. Usually, a few taxis are waiting just outside if you need a lift home. "
vue cinemas exeter,negative,Only parking is up/down a massive hill!
vue cinemas glasgow,positive,"This is a great shopping park as lots of parking and great buses only thing what lets it down no train station St Enochs car park is behind the Centre itself. If going to the cinema (+ don't have a blue badge) Get your parking ticket validated at the cinema, and the parking is only £1 for 4hrs - long enough for any film!   The nearest train stations are Glasgow Central and Queen Street. Buses and underground are also nearby. There were several accessible toilets, these were next to the other toilets, and had the same decor.   The toilet was large enough to manoeuvre a wheelchair/ have carers.  The toilet had a full length mirror on the door - something which is often missed in accessible toilets."
vue cinemas halifax,positive,"Accessible toilets are on both levels to screens 1 - 4 and to screens 5 - 9. They are a bit tight for a carer to join you, but it is possible. No Changing Places toilets. They are usually kept clean."
vue cinemas lancaster,negative,Well sign posted. Onstreet disabled parking. Bus / train station too far away. 
vue cinemas lancaster,positive,It was very clean. Staff directed me to the toilet and it was accessible. 
vue cinemas leeds,negative,There is a disabled access toilet though it somewhat narrow and maybe difficult for some to negotiate 
vue cinemas london,positive,"The cinema/ shopping complex is almost opposite Angel Tube Station which is not step free. Nearest step free station is King's Cross and from there and there is the option to take buses to outside of Angel Central. There are several bus routes that serve the Angel Islington. There was an accessible toilet in the main foyer. It required a RADAR key to open it. Inside it was spacious and clean. There were grab rails and an emergency cord which reached towards the ground. The lighting levels in the toilet were very low and this is why I marked it down slightly, I needed a moment for my eyes to adjust and this might be a problem for some visually impaired people."
vue cinemas norwich,positive,Multi storey next door with lots disabled spaces or right on good bus route Large easy open door lots of hand rails clean tidy good height toilet room for carer. Easy to find 
vue cinemas stirling,positive,"Plenty of disabled spaces in car park. Close to the train station. Great disabled toilets on both floors There is a large public car park just next to the cinema. It has a number of marked disabled bays. Otherwise you have to pay at ticket machine to park, but it is a set rate of a couple of pounds for a full day's parking, so is very reasonable.  The cinema is also very close to the train station, and there are local buses too. "
vulcan lodge cottages rhayader,positive,"There was ample parking at the side of our cottage on tarmac, there is more parking to the rear of the cottages but this is on small gravel, there are bus stops nearby, but the venue is just over 3 miles from the village of Rhayader. There is a garage with Spar and Greggs cafe about a hundred yards away. The cottages were fully adapted wet rooms, with stools, grab rails, hand rails at the side of the toilets."
w washington dc hotel washington,positive,We went there after visiting the Smithsonian and it was about 15 minutes. Not sure what parking is like nearby. Clean and tidy and spacious as per most of the US loos!
waddesdon manor waddesdon,positive,"Very large car park with many blue badge spaces.  There is a wheelchair friendly shuttle bus to transport visitors from the car park to the gardens and house. There is an accessible loo in the new visitor centre in the car park, there is one near the house but it's not really big enough for a wheelchair. There's one at the stables but this is a long walk downhill. There is also cafe there.  "
wagamama aylesbury,negative,"Plenty of accessible spaces at the top and bottom ends of the car park, however Wagamamas is in the middle and there are no spaces directly outside."
wagamama aylesbury,positive,"Spacious accessible loo. This was located away from  the other loos (the regular toilets were upstairs and the accessible one was at the back of the restaurant, downstairs). A lovely loo with appropriate rails and decent tiles, low level sink etc. fab!"
wagamama edinburgh,negative,Some on street parking in Castle Street if you can find a space or theres the Castle Street car park. Lots of buses go up Lothian Road.
wagamama edinburgh,positive,Very nice and clean.
wagamama high wycombe,positive,Loads of disabled parking in the nearby multistore. There's also a nearby road with about six disabled bays which are limited to three hour stays. Food service is quick so you'll easily be in and out in that time unless you get sidetracked by the shops. One disabled toilet which doubles as a baby changing station. It's kept locked and fairly clean and the staff have a radar key if you don't.  I've been there loads and never had to wait so don't be put off by the fact that you're sharing it with parents.
wagamama london,negative,"There is a Raddar  toilet next to M & S.  The toilets I have so far discovered are on 3rd floor of John Lewis - very nice toilet BUT no Raddar lock on it when I went some lady was using it and taking her time,  she looked guilty but .....  I had to wait There are loads of buses in Oxford St of course, which is a block away, but the nearest step-free stations (until the completion of Tottenham Court Road Station c. 2017) are a long way off - Green Park and King's Cross. A brand new and rather swanky accessible toilet. The red cord is long and reaches all the way to the floor. The only problem is that two bins had been put in the wheelchair transfer area. So it was not possible to park next to the toilet for a sideways transfer. Two stars lost for this rather thoughtless failure."
wagamama london,positive,"Brent Cross is very accessible providing lifts are working Tottenham Court Rd tube station is fully step-free street to train (Northern Line), street to platform (Central Line, and - beware! - no manual boarding ramps on Central Line platforms).   Many bus routes serve nearby Oxford St. What a pleasure to be able to report on a perfectly designed and laid-out accessible toilet! Full marks! Across the river from the accessible Westminster Tube Station, taxi drop off is a little walk away."
wagamama manchester,positive,Quite a few reserved on street parking places for disabled drivers on the side roads off Deansgate.
wagamama norwich,positive,Good
wagamama swindon,positive,"I got a lift, but the Outlet village has public transport and free disabled parking. Disabled toilet is a standard, basic one so plenty of rails but no adult changing or hoist. Not huge but room to manoeuvre. Emergency cord hangs all the way to the floor. Well stocked, clean and tidy, and a full length mirror. "
wagamama trowbridge,positive,Disabled parking outside the front door Fully accessible disabled loos
wahaca cardiff,positive,The restaurant is in Cardiff's city centre and close to Cardiff Central train station. The shopping centre also has its own car park. The accessible toilet was quite stylish and very clean. It loses a mark because there was no red emergency cord. One of the bins may also be slightly in the way for someone using the transfer space.
wahaca edinburgh,positive,"Very close to an Edinburgh tram stop, numerous bus stops and very near to Edinburgh Waverley. Closest parking is probably beside St Andrew Square or in the train station itself. Wide paths with dropped kerbs outside.  Disabled parking is on street, just around the corner on St Andrew's Square. Plenty of room The venue is across the road from Waverley station, there are plenty of bus links and there is even a tram stop. The toilets are fully accessible We could walk from our hotel to the restaurant but it was easily accessible from the street. Easy to find, had to go up in a lift from the ground floor. Plenty of room, well equipped. "
wahaca southbank london,positive,"There are tube stations nearby, as there is parking on street, however if you were walking and you had issues with mobility this is maybe not the best venue for you. If you use a wheelchair a power chair however this is ideal. There is a wheelchair accessible toilet, which is easily accessed, and has ample room."
waitrose edinburgh,positive,Plenty of space and very clean. Accessible door. To the right of entrance to store from Comely Bank or to the right of the lifts from the car park.
waitrose ponteland,negative,There are only three disabled parking spaces available and the parking gets very busy at times. Parking is very close to the entrance/exit door.
waitrose salisbury,positive,Plenty of disabled parking  All easy
waitrose swindon,positive,This supermarket has the best disabled parking I have ever seen anywhere. They have a specific blue badge only separate parking area right at the front.  The bus stops are not as close as they could be. Maybe something that the local bus company Thamesdown could consider.
waldorf astoria berlin,positive,"accessible toilet, 1 per floor"
waldorf astoria edinburgh   the caledonian edinburgh,negative,"We used public buses, and bus stops involved a little pushing, but easy enough over uneven paving at times, and a number of routes to pick from with a little research."
waldorf astoria the caledonian edinburgh,positive,"The hotel has its own car parking and an entrance from the car park directly in to the hotel.  Conveniently placed, the hotel is a short distance from Princes Street and the many buses, trams, taxis and tour buses that travel along there. There are several accessible toilets throughout the hotel. I visited two and they were large and easy to access. Private car park at back of hotel with disabled access to reception Accessible toilets on main floor The hotel has its own car park.  Public transport is widely available with a taxi rank outside the main entrance. Trams and buses plying their way along nearby Princes Street. There were two accessible toilets off of Peacock Alley."
wales millennium centre cardiff,negative,"I was at the Centre for a week for a major event. I sometimes used two walking poles and sometimes used a scooter. I usually used the disabled toilet on the first floor which was very convenient. However, one day I popped in from outside just to use the toilet and used the main toilet on the ground floor. It was a busy day. There was a queue on the left hand side to the ladies toilets so I had to pass these on my scooter, coming to meet people coming from the gents/disabled/baby changing toilets. This was doable and didn't bother me. I parked my scooter outside the disabled toilet at the end of the corridor and went in. This was a well-equipped changing places toilet. When I came out, I found that the only way to turn around would be to poke the scooter's nose into the gents' toilet for a sort of 3 point turn. As far as I can see, the only alternative was to reverse the scooter along the busy, narrow corridor against the flow of men, disabled people and people with pushchairs. This was an extremely frustrating experience.  I was so cross that millions of pounds could be spent on an iconic building without paying due attention to the dignity of disabled people.  "
wales millennium centre cardiff,positive,"Public car park next door, some disabled spaces on the street and ring venue to book venues own disabled spaces if it’s a very popular event  Regular disabled toilets and toilet with hoist on ground floor, useful if you are exploring the Bay you can just pop in The venue has its own carpark and tickets can be purchased for the disabled spaces when tickets for events are booked but there were none available when I booked. There was disabled parking available in the public multi-storey car park very close by. Tickets for this can also be purchased for £3.60 in advance if you are attending an event at WMC. We didn't know this but our parking only cost £4 anyway. I didn't use the accessible toilets this time. Parked outside despite it being a weekend. Please see photos. These were stylish, clean, well-sized and well equipped. Far superior to your average accessible loo. Next to venue by prior arrangement. very good as far as I remember. I am not confined to a wheelchair so don't usually take one into the toilet."
waleswood caravan and camping park sheffield,positive,"This site is just off the M1 at J31. You can actually see the motorway from the site, though no noticeable road noise. The road into the site is wide enough for two vehicles to pass.   The path from the campsite down to the country park is steep and very uneven. I decided not to attempt it on my own. To drive down, you have to go back to the main road and down to the next right turn. Shame there isn't an accessible path down but it whatever they did would mean a fair climb back up. They have clearly put a lot of thought and planning into accessible facilities, which is great. I did use the toilet a couple of times but I mostly use my own. There is a key code on each toilet door and they give you the code on arrival, but it's a bit pointless really as the locks seem to not work and if you just pull the door they open anyway.   The elsan point (where you empty the motorhome toilet) is on a level concrete path and is low enough to reach from a wheelchair. I've had a look at it and hope to test it out on my final morning. Big well done to the planners though on this one, as emptying the loo is rarely manageable on my own! Relatively easy access from the road network, with open aspects to the aproach."
walford mill crafts wimborne minster,negative,Only really accessible by car.  No vehicles allowed on site but the neighbouring (cheap) Pay and Display car park has (only) 2 disabled spaces close to the mill.
walker art gallery liverpool,positive,Merseyrail. Central Station.  Lift from platforms always busy and you have to queue. Staff really friendly and helpful
walking on air kinross,positive,"Disabled parking clearly marked next to clubhouse Disabled accessible toilets, clearly marked. Cubicle lark enough for scooter/Powerchair and carer. Drop down assist bar, grab rails etc. Separate hand washing. Very visibly marked disabled parking bays. Ladies and gents disabled toilets with extra wide door. Lots of space for carer too. Drop down bar plus other grabrails. always very clean  "
wallops wood cottages southampton,positive,Next to the accessible cottage. Large car park also available nearby Can't remember much about it but was clean & tidy
walltown crags greenhead,negative,Didn't use it so can't comment. However there is a loo.
walmer castle and gardens walmer,negative,"Accessible toilets are available but I can't remember exactly what they were like. Didn't use, but had a quick look in and they looked standard, albeit along a fairly narrow garden path. They are a long way from the house though, and involves having to get the side gate to the gardens unlocked by a staff member."
walmer castle and gardens walmer,positive,"There was quite a lot of parking which was nearby the entrance.  There is dedicated disabled parking near the entrance to the house, but if you are accessing the castle after walking there from Deal along the promenade (which is lovely and flat) then the path makes you navigate through a pot-holed gravel car park, along a tree-rooted path and over a road with no drop kerbs."
wardie bay beach edinburgh,negative,"Wardie Bay is on one of North Edinburgh's main roads, there is a bus stop right by the entrance to the beach, no parking space nearby that I'm aware of."
wards nurseries garden centre ltd dronfield,positive,There are about 5 disabled spaces although  it is a common place for the elderly to go for lunch so the disabled spaces do seem to fill up quickly. The only way to get to the garden centre is by car or taxi. There is no bus stop near by and no footpath on the road outside the garden centre. New disabled toilet installed with grab rails and easy to use tap.
wareham forest tourist park wareham,negative,First off the disabled access bathroom toilet did not have an emergency cord. The lock on the door was small and fiddlely to use. Not enough grab rails. Shower did have a fold down seat. Floor very slippery when wet. The seat provided was a white plastic patio seat. Every time I stood up I was worried as it did not feel sturdy.
wareham forest tourist park wareham,positive,Plenty of room to park
warkworth castle and hermitage warkworth,negative,"This Is difficult to rate fairly. On the one hand, it's great there is one. However it was very difficult for me to use it and I'm lucky in that I can weight-bear.  Even then there was barely enough space for me to put my feet on the floor, getting out of my wheelchair. So many would find this difficult, if not impossible for their needs. Once on my feet, there wasn't enough room for my knees when sitting in the loo as my wheelchair was pressed up against it! I travelled by car. The carpark was gravel with a couple blue badge places, near to the entrance . Not too bad"
warmley waiting room bristol,negative,Warmley waiting room does have a fairly large toilet with a small step to access. I was able to use this with my crutches but would not be able to in my wheelchair. It is not an accessible toilet. It does not have rails or pull cords etc. There is a council run toilet block opposite with a radar key disabled toilet. 
warmley waiting room bristol,positive,On several bus routes. On the Bristol to bath cycle path. Shares its land with ‘Warmley Wheelers’ cycling for the disabled. Council car park and on street car park very near. 
warner bros studio tour watford,positive,"lots of parking spaces big enough for me and two carers I arrived at the studio by car and was delighted to see so many parking bays for disabled access, the staff in the parking lot were really friendly and welcoming and directed us to the next available space. From what I understand if you come by train there are regular shuttle buses from the local station, Watford Junction, all of which are wheelchair accessible. Toilet facilities are clearly delineated, with the disabled toilets having good accessibility and room inside if you need someone with you. Watford Junction Railway Station is where I caught the coach to the studio which is wheelchair accessible, because I was travelling from the Midlands it was extra hassle as the lifts are out of action until February 2020. Would be a lot easier if didn't have to be diverted. There is disabled parking outside the entrance.  To get the bus there was quite a big queue and no seating. They also didn't let wheelchairs on first which meant there was very little turning space to get into the wheelchair space.  In reception there was a basic accessible loo with grab rails (grey) around the toilet and sink. There was also a changing places toilet. There were also other basic accessible loos available as you went around the studio.  There was also toilets in the car park near the bus stops. We got here early and we're the first I. The disabled parking area. This is next to the door and plentiful.  Perfectly adequate.  There are a good number of disabled spaces with plenty of room as well as being really close to the entrance making access easier. There are plenty of disabled toilets throughout the tour and they are all spacious, clean and well maintained. Drove straight to the venue, plenty of disabled parking right outside the entrance. Plenty of room and very clean. There are ample disabled parking bays with plenty of space. Although my son does not have a blue badge we were directed to a disabled bay to make it easier for my son. Disabled toilets are plentiful, clean and well maintained. There are several throughout the tour. It is well set-up for using public transport. You can get a train from Euston Station (in central London) to Watford Junction - make sure you get on an express train as this only takes 15/20mins.  At Watford Junction there are special Harry Potter' buses which come to the station every 20mins  and transport you to the door of the studio. These buses are all double deckers, they have an ramp at the door if required, and a wheelchair space on-board.  If travelling by car, they have a large free car-park, with marked disabled spaces. Standard accessible toilets are found throughout the venue.  However, they also have  an 'Accessibility Plus' facility, which has a changing-bench, hoist (you should bring your own sling) and even shower facilities.  Disabled parking really close to the door. Big bin next to the toilet makes transferring virtually impossible "
warrender swim centre edinburgh,positive,"Disabled parking spaces outside the front door. Buses on the nearby Marchmont Rd and Grange Road.  Decent sized, well equipped bathroom. Enough room to swing a long haired dachsund.  Several spaces in front of the centre, with ramp access up to main entrance. There is a sharp bend in the ramp, and wobbly tarmac at that point, which may prove difficult to negotiate unaided. Ramp into accessible toilet, shower fully equipped with handles and seat. Door opens outward, so help will be needed on way in."
warwick castle warwick,negative,Small. Very low. Only 1 side had a grab rail so needed help
warwick castle warwick,positive,Parked in castle car park. Fee payable even with blue badge but good location and easy to get to the castle
washago community centre washago,positive,We travelled by car. Large parking lot near doors. Two dedicated handicapped parking spaces. 
wat tyler country park basildon,positive,There are 4 large disabled parking bays right outside the exhibition centre. There is also a fair sized car park there as well as outside the Green Centre and also a smaller one at the marina end of the access road.  Pitsea station is nearby but it would be about a 15 minute walk and includes going over a level crossing. The disabled toilets are a generous size with grab rails and a lak of clutter.
water lane boathouse leeds,negative,"I couldn't see any toilets on the ground floor in the accessible area, but it was busy so I may have missed something."
water of leith walkway edinburgh,negative,Limited on street parking. Accessible buses run to and from Cannonmills.
water of leith walkway edinburgh,positive,"Can't comment on the parking. Excellent bus service (Lothian 26, 12, 31)  from city centre to Roseburn and from Slateford back to city centre (Lothian 34,35,44). At the Water of Leith Visitor Centre. Down a corridor. The person on duty was very helpful indeed - opening doors for us and showing us where the accessible toilet is. The accessible toilet is on the small side, but manageable. Can't comment on the parking. Lothian Buses 44 and 44A will get you from the city centre to Balerno High School, very close to where the walk begins, and then back from Currie to the city centre. It's a frequent service. There is an accessible toilet at Canonmills and is accessed using a RADAR key."
waterloo east railway station london,negative,"Getting to Waterloo East: all National Rail services at the main station, Waterloo, have step-free access, and there is a pedestrian bridge, with lifts, to get you from Waterloo to Waterloo East. On London Underground, only the Jubilee Line has step-free access at Waterloo. The Northern and Bakerloo lines at Waterloo (a major London terminus!), are no-go areas for wheelchair users. Many buses serve Waterloo Station. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area."
waterloo east railway station london,positive,"There is an excellent accessible toilet on the middle pair of platforms, spacious, well-designed, accessible by RADAR key. It is refreshing to find such an excellent toilet on the railway network."
waterloo gardens teahouse cardiff,negative,In a quiet residential road. No car park. Close to Albany and Newport Roads so plenty of public transport. On street parking available.
waterloo gardens teahouse cardiff,positive,I didn't check for grab rails. Room for a carer and easy to find.
waterloo railway station waterloo station,positive,"As a main station there is no parking but you can drop people off. There are plenty of public transport options from the trains themselves, the underground, plenty of buses and taxis. There was an accessible toilet off the concourse which was accessed via a RADAR key. It was easy to get in to but a little tight on turning space once you are in."
waterloo tea cardiff,negative,City Centre arcade so no street parking but parking nearby in John Lewis (100m) or St David's centre (200m). 500m from Cardiff Central Station. Accessible loo with grab bars but too narrow to turn a wheelchair or for side transfer and not deep enough to close door with power chair in.
waterloo tea cardiff,positive,Very easy to find. I had left my mobility scooter outside and had walked in so I couldn't really tell how easy it would be to manouevre but there seemed to be enough space and the toilet was spotlessly clean.
watermouth castle ilfracombe,positive,Loads of level disabled parking right outside of the main entrance. At least two wheelchair accessible toilets. The toilet at the top of the park doesn't have any grab rails but the one at the bottom of the park does.
waterperry gardens oxford,positive,"We drove, parking was fine, I walked to the gift shop to pick up the scooter."
waterside holiday park spa weymouth,negative,"Parking alongside caravans. Can be tight at some units so check when booking especially if, like us you have a large w.a.v. Several accessible loos unisex with radar access. Roomy with red cord alarm. "
waterside pool ryde,positive,"Near a main bus route and not far from the bus station, train station and hovercraft terminal. Next to the beach with plenty of public parking including disabled spaces. Blue badge holders park free. Accessible loo in shower room Ceiling track hoist. Plenty of well placed textured grab rails plus pull down rail Emergency cord. Clinical waste bin Easy open/lock door handle Textured grab rail on back of the door Plenty of hooks on back of the door"
waterston house aberlady,positive,We drove from Edinburgh to Waterston House. There is a small car park which has a disabled parking space.  There is a   Disabled toilet. 
waterstones edinburgh,positive,At the back of the top floor where the cafe is. Were actually pretty clean (seen some pretty ropey ones in Waterstones!)
waterstones glasgow,negative,There is little to no parking nearby.
waterstones glasgow,positive,"I used the accessible toilet on the Lower Ground floor next to the cafe. (There is another next to the Cafe Bar on the top floor but I didn’t use this). The cafe one is through one door which was quite heavy and then you have to turn left/ do a U turn to get into the toilet. Plenty space inside for a powerchair to turn and for someone to come in with you. No red cord though!! Don’t know how to report this, any tips reviewers?  "
waterstones london,negative,"The nearest step-free station is King's Cross, which is quite a distance away. Several bus routes will drop you very nearby in Gower St. There is an ""accessible"" toilet which is almost useless for wheelchair users. If you are lucky, you will find it open and the access code hand-written on a piece of paper stuck on the door. You will need to type the access code onto the security lock if you can. Inside it's cramped, far too little room to manoeuvre, not even enough room to wash a hamster. There is no emergency cord. This is completely useless! If you fall over you will not be able to summon assistance. It can be a life-and-death matter in the case of a fall and serious injury. There are no step-free stations nearby. At Angel tube station you can get from street to platform using only escalators, which is a bonus (no fixed steps at all). Many bus routes pass Islington Green, amongst others the 43, 73, 19, and 38. Several bus routes will drop you off nearby. There are no step-free stations nearby, though if you are patient you could wait for Tottenham Court Road Station to become step-free, c. 2017. Trafalgar Square and nearby Whitehall are well served by buses but there are no step-free stations in the vicinity, unless you use the suburban trains to and from Charing Cross, where ramp assistance, as at all mainline London stations, it a bit patchy and random. There are no step-free stations nearby. There are several bus routes serving nearby Charing Cross Road."
waterstones london,positive,"There is one customer toilet. It's wheelchair-accessible and well designed, but staff have thoughtlessly put a large waste-bin in the wheelchair transfer area. They do not understand that this area is NOT free space but is required by a wheelchair user for parking when transferring to the toilet. Toilet paper is not replenished frequently enough. Many bus routes serve Piccadilly and stop right outside the shop. Green Park tube station is step-free and just a few blocks away. But check before you travel - the lifts at Green Park are notoriously and infuriatingly unreliable.  There is a spacious and comfortable accessible toilet on the 5th floor, adjoining the bar/restaurant. It's very good and there is even a decorative display of beautiful round objects in one corner (see my picture below). The shop is on Piccadilly and is near to Piccadilly Circus and Green Park tube stations and several buses run  along the street. I travelled on public transport and the bus stop is next door to the shop. There is a disabled access toilet. I didn't use it on this occasion. Clapham Junction Station is spitting distance away. On a good day you can get prompt ramp assistance there when boarding or leaving any train, though the assistance service can be patchy and a bit random. The London Overground also serves this station, and their ramp assistance is almost always completely reliable and friendly. Many bus routes serve this immediate area too, so for wheelchair users it's a good place to go shopping."
waterstones richmond,positive,"Many bus routes serve Richmond, and the station is less than half a mile away, District Line and National Rail, with staff always on hand to give assistance with ramps etc. A really good accessible toilet with everything correctly in place, a long red emergency cord dangling freely to the floor as it should, and plenty of room for manoeuvre."
waterstones scarborough,positive,"Parking can be a problem, but then it is a shop in the middle of a pedestrian precinct of a holiday town, so parking always a problem"
waterworks museum hereford,positive,"Own transport. See below The toilet was adequate for my needs, (mobility scooter) although a larger scooter user would find it a squeeze. The facilities were clean and there were paper towels soap and air freshener available"
watford junction railway station watford,positive,Bus stops are located at the front of the station including the Harry Potter tour bus. 
watt brothers robroyston glasgow,positive,Dedicated parking at the door of every store in this retail park
wave london,positive,"The nearest station is Hackney Central, which is part of the Overground. According to National Rail Step free access to ticket office and Platform 2 (eastbound) only. Access to Platform 1 (westbound) is via footbridge.   There are several buses that stop within a level, five minute walk of the cafe.  The cafe is a little bit tucked away. It's in Dispensary Lane, a pedestrianised alleyway, off Mare Street. I have attached a photo of the entrance to Dispensary Lane. There is a very short walk where there are walls on both side but from the entrance you can see ahead there is the  cafe, nail bar and beauty salon as well as some flats and public bench seating, so it feels safe to walk down. The Lane is off Mare Street by the junction of Kenmure Street. At time of writing it is opposite a Vodaphone shop. The Lane is level, paved. At the rear of the cafe is a toilet. There is a single grab rail and no emergency cord. Also in the toilet is a changing baby area. See photos for details. "
wayford bridge inn stalham,positive,"I arrived in my car and, at check in, was directed to disabled parking adjacent to a ramp to get to my room"
weald and downland open air museum singleton,positive,"We drove, there are four blue badge bays opposite the ticket office. Can imagine it would get a bit crowded sometimes but there's plenty of parking on site. Apparently you can drive a car into the middle of the site with permission, if you couldn't otherwise make it in.  There's also another entrance below the ticket office which we were given the code for."
webbs wychbold droitwich,positive,"Very easy parking with lots of disabled bays Just over 3 miles from Droitwich town, with an easy to find route, a huge car park is available, with many disabled bays for you."
websters sports centre kirriemuir,positive,Lots of parking less than 50m from front door over flat ground Easy to find. Lots of space
wee lochan glasgow,positive,Although it is on a Main Street there are plenty of on street parking spaces in the surrounding residential streets offering free level access parking.
weetslade country park wideopen,positive,The car park is at the start if the walk. Brown tourist signs direct you from nearby roads. There are several blue badge spaces nearest to the path.  I'm guessing buses pass nearby but I did not take note.
weetwood hall estate leeds,negative,"Multiple disabled toilets can be found throughout the venue on both floors. The locks displays the words “vacant” or “engaged”, both on a white background, which is difficult to read even for someone with relatively good vision. I did not need the toilet during my time there so cannot say anything else."
weetwood hall estate leeds,positive,"Disabled parking poorly marked and all round a circular entrance area , I think Never easy to park on a circle Is on a bus route Room to turn round"
welcome break ashorne,negative,Yes there was a disabled toilet and it was a reasonably large size but the thing that really surprised me is that there was only one vertical rail that was on the wall behind the toilet cistern. There were plenty of horizontal rails and a drop down rail to enable side access but I require vertical rails and there wasn't one that I could use!
welcome break birmingham,positive,Disabled parking right by the door. Changing places toilet available. Fitted with hoists etc. Wonderful facility but on my second trip it was in dire need of cleaning. No sign of a checklist for cleaning and didn't know who to report to.
welcome break gretna,negative,"The loo was clean and tidy, but a little small and the lock was broken.  They did have a sign to say they were aware of the lock being broken.  I was fine as I had my dad with me to stand guard but not sure what you were meant to do it you were alone - sing?"
welcome break gretna,positive,Plenty accessible parking right outside the front door.
welcome break newport pagnell,positive,Drove obviously! Several blue badge bay by front door. Well equipped. Not really large enough to turn a chair inside.  Reasonable clean.  No radar key needed. Plenty of Blue Badge parking spaces and close to the entrance Free parking for up to 2 hrs Accessible loo Changing Place - just remember your Radar key Clean and tidy with plenty of facilities  Lots and lots of space to move around in and room for carers. Only downside was that the Emergency Red Cord should have been longer but I left a card.
wellcome collection london,negative,There are buses that pass by the door but i am unsure which service is provided as we arrived by foot. I could not see any accessible parking.
wellcome collection london,positive,"We were travelling on foot - it's a short distance from Euston and King's Cross stations - with plenty of train and bus links. Very good - clean and spacious. The Wellcome Collection is centrally located on Euston Road and almost opposite Euston Station. Also nearby are Euston Square and Warren Street Tube Stations. The nearest step free tube station is King's Cross. There are a number of buses that stop very close by. I travelled on public transport to get there and it was only a 2 minute walk from getting off the bus. The automatic flush- dry toilet in the Changing Rooms toilet is now operational. Clean, spacious, emergency cords with Euan's Guide cards, everything perfect.  The Wellcome Collection is centrally located on Euston Road and almost opposite Euston Station. Also nearby are Euston Square and Warren Street Tube Stations. The nearest step free tube station is King's Cross. There are a number of buses that stop very close by. I travelled on public transport to get there and it was only a 2 minute walk from getting off the bus. The accessible and Changing Places toilets are open on each level. They were extremely clean and tidy. They are spacious, with grab rails and emergency cords which reach to the floor. In the Changing Places toilet there is a sign saying that toilet can be flushed manually or operating the touchless controls you can activate the wash/ dry mechanism. While I was there I couldn't get it to work (and I did report this). There should be a mechanism to squirt water to wash you and then a drier comes on.  This maybe really useful for people who find it difficult to wipe their bottom.  The Wellcome Collection is centrally located on Euston Road. It's almost opposite Euston Station and also nearby is Euston Square, Warren Street and King's Cross stations. There are a number of buses that stop very close by. I travelled on public transport to get there and it was only a 2 minute walk from getting off the bus. There's disabled accessible toilets on each floor and these are clearly signposted. They are spacious, clean and with alarm and grab rails. The Wellcome Collection is centrally located on Euston Road and almost opposite Euston Station. Also nearby are Euston Square and Warren Street Tube Stations. The nearest step free tube station is King's Cross. There are a number of buses that stop very close by. I travelled on public transport to get there and it was only a 2 minute walk from getting off the bus. Changing Rooms toilet is clean, spacious, emergency cords with Euan's Guide cards.

There are a number of buses that stop very close by. I travelled on public transport to get there and it was only a 2 minute walk from getting off the bus. A Changing Places toilet has recently been installed on the ground floor. It requires a RADAR key, which can be obtained from the information desk or cloakroom. This includes hoist, adjustable bench, toilet, shower. There was a trolley well stocked with toilet roll and rubber gloves. There were 2 emergency cords.   Also on the ground floor are 2 brand new accessible toilets. One of which also doubles up with baby changing facilities. They are spacious, with plenty of grab rails and with emergency cords.  All emergency cords have Euan's Guide Red Cord Cards on them.  The Wellcome Collection is centrally located on Euston Road. It's almost opposite Euston Station and also nearby is Euston Square, Warren Street and King's Cross stations. There are a number of buses that stop very close by. There's disabled accessible toilets on each floor and these are clearly signposted. They are spacious, clean and with alarm and grab rails. There are two on site disabled parking spaces that must be booked with the the Wellcome Collection's Access team. Space is tight and a WAV driver may need an escort.  It has 2 accessible bathrooms and 1 changing place bathroom. All bathrooms are in one area. These 3 bathrooms are separate from the able bodied bathrooms. The separation is well designed. Of the two accessible bathrooms, one has a nappy changing table. I visited the accessible bathrooms only and both were very clean. Nice fresh decor as well  I arrived into London Euston train station and it was only a short walk to Wellcome. The nearest underground stations are Euston Square, Euston and Warren Street.  I believe there are accessible toilets on every floor. They each had a different look and the one on the second floor had a sliding door. On the ground floor there is a Changing Places toilet that can be accessed with a RADAR key. The accessible toilets I look at looked like there was enough space to manoeuvre and had the appropriate grab rails and red emergency cords (with Euan's Guide's Red Cord Cards attached). The flush on each was located on the wall behind the toilet, which might not be the best location for everyone. It was great to see that two of the three accessible toilets I looked in also had a shelf next to the toilet. "
wellow trekking centre wellow,positive,You can't park directly beside the cottage. There is a large car park which is fairly close but I couldn't push myself to it and others in my group helped. Would be easy enough in an electric chair. There is a very large wet floor shower with a toilet that has rails. There was a shower seat but no rails at the shower 
wells cathedral wells,positive,"We parked in The Swan Hotel where we were staying so there was no problem.  Lovely, clean, accessible loos with lots of grab rails. "
wells farmshop cafe peach croft farm abingdon,negative,"No disabled spots, just a pot holed rough loosely compacted ground area, made to look worse by the heavy rain, and very limited food on offer, but in good condition, would buy if needed, but not appealing enough for the journey to get there."
wells maltings wells next the sea,positive,We parked In the Wells next the sea town centre but there are disabled parking spaces adjacent to the cultural centre. Fully accessible disabled toilet with sink in the cultural centre by the cafe 
welsh countrymans gamefair carmarthen,negative,"Parking was provided in a makeshift farmers yard which was hard standing, but had no markings. Members of staff had no comprehension of what space wheelchair users need, and ended up blocking vehicles from both wheelchair access, as well as blocking the ability of cars to get out of the car park.  For our visit, it required announcements to the whole arena to get drivers back to vehicles to move them so that customers could leave!  The venue is in a field along a countryside lane that has no pavements, and is 0.5 miles from the nearest main road. Buses in the area are infrequent, on Saturdays there is a bus at 10am, 2pm and 4pm.  On Sundays, four buses operate at 11am, 1pm, 4pm and 6pm but are accessible for a single wheelchair. There were three toilets marked on the map, for the toilet nearest the arena, they were mobile toilets with no disabled provision. It was impossible to maneuver a wheelchair to other two toilet blocks to see if they were accessible."
wembley stadium wembley,negative,I travelled on Coach so couldnt comment on the parking 
wembley stadium wembley,positive,"Drove to the venue, pre booked free disabled parking. The parking was right outside the stadium entrance and accessible by ramp. Clean and spacious. Radar key needed so no queues or sneaky desperate people. There is plenty of accessible parking at the stadium for blue badge holders. This has to be booked in advance, which can be done via the venue's website. For some events blue badge parking is free; for other events there may be a charge - this depends on the event promoter. The nearest tube stations - Wembley Park and Wembley Stadium - are stated to have step-free access, though we did not inspect this. There are stated to be 147 accessible toilets within the stadium, accessed via RADAR key. The two toilets that we visited during our trip were both spacious, with fixed rail on the wall side and drop-down rail on the other side."
wemyss bay ferry terminal wemyss bay,negative,"Parking good, right at front of station with extra parking around the side, although it gets very busy and sometimes difficult to park. There is also a bus stop just outside  Did not use the toilets on this occasion but did not see any signs for a disabled toilet so unsure if it is just ladies & gents?"
wemyss bay ferry terminal wemyss bay,positive,Easy & stress free.
wentworth garden centre wentworth,negative,"8 disabled bays are available towards the entrance gates of Wentworth Garden Centre. On my visit, these disabled bays were full with a couple of cars queuing for a disabled by to become available. Due to the business, car parking spaces close to the entrance on levelled tarmac are quickly taken. Although the garden centre does have a large car park besides the disabled bays, uneven, pebbled ground which could hinder manoeuvring wheelchairs.  A bus stop is located a short 5 minute walk from the garden centre which buses from the centre of Rotherham run frequently throughout the day."
wentworth garden centre wentworth,positive,"Toilets are well sign posted around the garden centre. Fully adapted Disabled toilets are also available which on my visit appeared clean and large enough to manoeuvre a wheelchair when required. There is a large number of disabled parking spots. Therefore, every time you visit you are always guaranteed to get a disabled parking spot. The disabled parking is located right at the entrance. The loo's are easy to find. There are disabled loo's, which have a hand rail and a cord if you need immediate help. They are very clean and get checked regularly. The loo's are on the same level making it wheelchair friendly."
west bank park york,negative,"There is an accessible toilet available which also doubles as a baby change. The toilet is opened by a radar key and swings outwards. The toilet has a grab rail attached to the wall on the left side and has a drop down rail on the right. There are also rails next to the sink. The toilet is a high toilet which helps with standing.  There is an alarm cord in the corner of the toilet.  The score is knocked down because whilst the toilet itself was clean and any rubbish was contained in a bin, the floor of the toilet looked dirty and this makes the whole cubicle appear unsanitary. "
west bank park york,positive,"There is a small car park near one of the entrances to the park. This does not have any designated disabled spaces or any spaces outlined.  There is a small side road between the car park and park entrance, both sides have drop kerbs. It is also possible to park on the residential streets near the park entrances but this is not guaranteed.  There are numerous bus services passing on the main road between the city centre / train station and Acomb, another entrance to the park is located on this road. There are bus stops very close to the entrance on both sides of the road. There are drop kerbs and a central island if the road needs crossing to get to the park entrance.   Each of the four entrances to the park have level access and the gates are held open during the parks opening hours. The openings are wide."
west dean gardens chichester,negative,Limited disabled parking spaces (4)  but close to the entrance.
west dean gardens chichester,positive,"I drove to the gardens and I do not know about public transport. There are 6 generously sized blue badge parking spaces, 4 very close to the entrance and 2 a further 10 metres away. See photo. One accessible toilet. Clean and the red cord touched the ground. No photo as there is one from the previous review. I also liked the fact the door was not heavy so I could open and close it myself and there was plenty of room for me to turn around and open the door. The disabled loo I visited was marked on the map, clearly signposted and reasonably equipped."
west dumbartonshire citizens advice bureau dumbarton,positive,CAB has its own car park with disabled bays linked to the main building by good ramps.  Male and female toilets with all required rails and ample side transfer space from left to right. The cord was too short but in their defence the toilets were new and had been signed off by building control.  Chief exec was right on to it. 
west lothian gymnastics livingston,negative,There are 3 main disabled parking spaces closest to the building the only thing that would be annoying is that the spaces are quite close together especially when there are other cars at either side.
west lothian gymnastics livingston,positive,Not the easiest to find but a relatively good size for anyone needing assistance on in a wheelchair.
west midland safari park bewdley,negative,"The park invested 2.5 million in it's new Living Dinosaur attraction but spent nil money (from the three toilets I visited) in making toilet facilities accessible. The toilets in the car park do not have support rails each side nor much space. The same goes for the ones at the reptile house. The cafe toilet I used  was dangerous, missing many support rails (and the one provided was the wrong length and height to be useful to hold onto), the toilet seat was child size.  I nearly fell on the floor. Hand towels were not reachable from a wheelchair."
west midland safari park bewdley,positive,Blue badge parking a short walk from the walk around section was fine - smooth flat surface to get out. I don't recall hash lines to the rear of my car for safe rear entrance/exit.
west park goole,negative,"There are two accessible toilets. At one end of the car park is a RADAR locked toilet, which is very basic and not really maintained now. However, it is often cleaner than the main one.  Next to the cafe is an accessible toilet which is open to all. I think this is also the baby changing facility. It is currently used by all, due to Covid restrictions, and is therefore busy and often not as clean as it should be. Due to the nature of the park attracting many young people, we have often found groups of teenies playing in the toilet and had to wait ages for them to come out."
west park goole,positive,Access to the parking area is down a small residential street (well signposted from the main road). The entrance area is a little narrow and has a height limit. The car park has recently been extended and now has plenty of parking. There are several blue badge spaces.
west park leisure centre nottingham,negative,The toilet in the reception area is small so would be a squeeze if you need a carer. From what I've seen so far they do not have a changing places toilet but I'll update if I find a hidden one. Grab rails were white and around toilet and sink.   The reception desk has a lowered wheelchair accessible counter. 
west park leisure centre nottingham,positive,There is free disabled parking outside of gym.   I came from Derby and the bus stop was located quite a walk away from the gym across a busy road. 
west princes street gardens edinburgh,negative,"You can park on street in Kings Stables Road. Then you have a fair distance to walk to get into the park, around 500 metres. If you come by public transport you can arrive from the Princes Street side of the park but beware of the very steep slopes you have to descend to get in. These ramp like slopes are not suitable for wheelchairs users. You'd need a rope, climbing gear and some sherpas to get down it! Parking is available in the car park off Kings Stables Road."
west princes street gardens edinburgh,positive,"Lots of wheelchair accessible buses pass by the gardens, although if you're looking for the most level access entrance, get a bus to Lothian Road and enter the garden via King's Stables Road. There is a multi-storey car park right beside the King's Stables Road entrance and lots of on street parking too.  The Park does have accessible toilets both at the East end and within the Ross Bandstand. I visit the one at the East end and must warn that it is built into the hill so it's quite a slope to wheel up to it. The entrance door has a RADAR lock and requires you to do a ninety degree turn to get in. Once in the space is long and narrow. It's clean and fairly good for what it is. From out of town , we park at Ingleston and get the wheelchair accessible tram into the city; the Princes Street stop isn't far from the National Gallery. Available in the Gallery and the Academy. There are accessible toilets adjacent to the children's play area and the Ross Bandstand."
west runton beach cromer,negative,No disabled toilet and there is a step at the entrance. However the toilets were very clean and well kept. The toilets are half way down the slope to the beach and you can get right up to the one step before entering the toilets.
west runton beach cromer,positive,There is parking above the beach but not tarmaced. Overflow parking is on grass. It’s not particularly level but I had no problems with my mobility scooter. Cost is £3 per vehicle for the day.
west sands beach st andrews,positive,Ample parking in the area immediately along the beachfront and beside the office.
west side market cleveland,positive,They have a car park with disbaled parking at the back on the market. There is a bus stop accross the road from the market aswell. 
west yorkshire playhouse leeds,positive,"Right in the city centre, just opposite the bus station so very good public transport connections. They also have a large car park, with about 15 disabled parking spaces that is free if you display a blue badge.  Changing place included in the accessible toilet, that needs a radar key to get in. Large and well equipped; very happy with this toilet.  There are disabled parking spaces directly outside the main entrance - however there aren't really enough of these so if you were unlucky parking would not be very convenient Top notch disabled loo with masses of space.  NB - requires Radar key to access"
western gailes golf club irvine,positive,There is a car park level with the ramp at the front door. You can be dropped off directly at the front door.
western yar estuary easy access ramble the quay,negative,"There's no car park and no disabled parking. However the ramble starts on a quiet country lane where  there is room to park and unload with care. Make sure you don't obstruct passage for passing cars,"
western yar estuary easy access ramble the quay,positive,There are no loos along the trail. However there is an excellent disabled loo if you visit Off The Rails towards the end if this trail.

The Centre is next to both Stratford International and Stratford Regional Stations. These give accessible access to the High Speed One railway service, the accessible Jubilee Line and the Docklands Light Railway. Top marks for the loos. Westfield has a Changing Places Toilet as wheel as several conventional accessible loos. All well signposted, clean and easy to access."
westminster abbey deans yd,positive,"There is an accessible toilet adjacent to the standard toilets. They're located through a side door to the Abbey where you cross a small courtyard into the dedicated toilet block. A helpful attendant held the doors and pointed out the way. On the way out and back in to the Abbey he helped by clearing the way for my chair through the crowds. The accessible toilet was spotlessly clean, spacious and had all the facilities you would expect to find. Check continually that all arrangements were made & have proof of email etc. Many available, some better than others. There were toilets and these included an accessible toilet. They weren't too easy to find at first but the stewards were very helpful and pointed out where to go."
westminster abbey london,positive,The nearest tube station to Westminster Abbey is Westminster which is step free. There are several buses that stop very close to the Abbey. There is an accessible toilet in the cloisters. It is spacious with grab rails and emergency cord.

westmorland general hospital kendal,positive,A number of Disabled bay at the Main Entrance and main entrance and a number to the side entrance .

There are three disabled parking spaces directly adjacent the museum at the top of Mushroom Lane and a further three disabled parking spaces available toward the bottom of Mushroom Lane near the tennis courts (access to the museum from these is through the park).   Blue badge holders can use Pay & Display bays on Mushroom Lane, (near the Dam House entrance) and Damer Street  without the need to pay .  "
weston park museum sheffield,positive,There are accessible toilets within this venue designated for public use but the toilet is not for the sole use of disabled people.

There is level access to the accessible toilet and everywhere else :)
westonbirt tetbury,positive,"The disabled parking is great and close to the entrance. Fully accessible changing area. Lots of disabled spaces in tarmaced carpark. Small toilet at entrance, but large changing places toilet near cafe."
westquay shopping centre southampton,positive,"Lots of well signed and monitotlred disabled bays. Clean, wide, and plentiful!"
wetwheels solent portsmouth,positive,"This is based down Gunwharf Portsmouth, they have a few rows of disabled bays which are very wide so enough room to get any aids out and set up. They have a couple of lifts to the car park. They are next to a train station and a bus depot for those who travel via public transport. The access from and to all these sites is good, with newly paved areas including nice ramps.  Gunwharf have a couple toilet blocks which do include disabled toilets. "
wey arun canal billingshurst,negative,"Parking is informal by roadside in Drungewick Lane near small bridge over canal. Though not a busy road, take care due to narrowness of road and proximity to bridge.To reverse walk access car park for Onslow Arms, Loxwood- overflow car park is behind canal centre. No disabled bays.  "

weymouth sea life adventure park weymouth,negative,There is 2 disabled toilets there the disabled toilet at adventure island has the emergency cord tucked into a fixture so it is not hanging freely all the way to the floor as they should be. Other than that it is fully accessible but the toilet is very low to the ground.

whitby abbey whitby,positive,"There are allocated spaces in the first car park you come to BUT don't use that, continue on bearing right and follow the road round past Whitby Brewery until you come to the turning circle at the end. Go through the archway to the left  (there is a sign indicating disabled parking spaces) and sure enough there are six spaces just inside on the right. These are FREE whereas you'll have to pay in the other car park. I can't describe it as our powerchair user didnt use it, but therewas one in the visitor centre I think and another in the cafe. Sporry can'r comment further - mnaybe someone else can add a comment about this?"
whitby library whitby,positive,there is disabled bays opposite the enterance. accessible large cubicle toilet.
whitby town whitby,positive,"Disabled designated bays have a time limit allocated and marked on the signs, up to three hours only. You can park all day free in the pay and display and they have a park and ride system too but I didn't use that so I do not know if they are accessible buses. The towns pavements are good but there are cobbled streets in a lot of places so I used pavements a lot. There were several around the town and on the paths along the side of the beach and the path along the top of the cliff. All Radar key and very clean, not in high season when I visited."
whitbys fish chip restaurant doncaster,negative,The disabled bays are quite a distance from the entrance
whitbys fish chip restaurant doncaster,positive,The place has ample disabled car parking and is also on a bus route so is a very convenient place to visit. Again excellent toilets with grab handles and plenty big enough for a carer and also for me to turn around in there.Very clean also.

white cross bay holiday park and marina windermere,positive,2 spaces outside the lodge dedicated to the property
white hart lane london,positive,"Managed to park up a side street near the ground with a disabled badge. Although it took a while to get moving after the game it was well worth it to be back in the warmth Plenty of options to park around staduim, due to construction of new stadium limited on site parking for anybody. Nearest tube with lift access is Tottenham Hale and plenty of buses pass the stadium . National  rail Northumberland park is accessible.  Easy to find slightly on the small side but are manageable  Disabled Parking available right outside the main entrance, multiple transport links like bus tube also available near stadium toilets were a decent size and reasonably close"

white hart sports social club sedbergh,positive,Not built yet but will be big enoiugh for wheelchair to turn a full circle
white house hotel bowness on windermere,negative,Hotel Review The White House   If you need disabled access and facilities forget this hotel. It's a danger if you use a wheelchair.   Disabled access and facilities are none existent. The disabled bedroom has no handrails in the shower. There is no shower seat in the shower as advised and I was given a garden sun lounger to use. The bathroom floor is slippy and no mats supplied watch it or you will fall for sure. The toilet is a normal low level toilet so useless for accessible use and will cause a fall.  Access to the hotel and bedroom was pathetic. No ramps I had to use pieces of wood.
white rabbit glastonbury,negative,"No Toilets available, but there is public ones a short distance away that are disabled friendly. There is no onsite parking here and the High St can be busy so on-street parking can be difficult but there are two car parks nearby with plenty of disabled spaces; I was able to find one every time I tried.  There are buses into Glastonbury from other areas but no train service but this helps to give it an other-worldly effect and making the journey is part of the 'Glastonbury experience' especially when you see the Tor come into view when driving into Glastonbury."
white rabbit glastonbury,positive,"Lots of public car parking Small number of disabled parking spaces over the road, large car park a few minutes walk away.  Accessible toilets accoss the road in Excalibur cafe, and in car park a few minutes walk away."
white rose shopping centre leeds,negative,Good number of spaces are provided but its rare to find one free. No enforcement so it is abused.
white rose shopping centre leeds,positive,"There are disabled parking bays at each entrance and a security guard patrolling to see this is not abused (unusual!!). The accessible toilets in entrance 5 have a left and also a right opening door ie. 2 disabled toilets. One of the accessible toilets in entrance 6 is operated by a Radar key and is a large room with a hoist and sink with adjustable height! Every accessory you might need either in one of the several disabled toilets or the fully functioning changing place They have about two or three of these in the shopping center. They have baby changing in too so expect a wait. Although they are clean they are very out dated and need to be replaced. Lots of disabled spaces. I used Car Park 6 and there remarkably was a guard checking that only disabled people used them spaces. There is a large changing room by the entrance (on left-hand side). It needs a radar key and door is rather heavy but provides no real problem (probably just needed oiling). I noticed numerous other disabled toilets but only visited one, which was fine but obviously not as big as the changing room."
white spot caledonia victoria,negative,In a mall with a couple of marked parking spaces and a badly marked ramp. Not very good.
white stuff edinburgh,positive,Parking immediately outside on George Street. This can get very busy - but there are also good bus links with stops a short walking distance away.
white swan london,negative,"Very close to Pimlico underground station.  There is an accessible toilet, with a radar key."
whitegates nursery northallerton,positive,"I travelled by car so have no knowledge of any public transport but it is deep in the country about 10 miles from Northallerton so perhaps a taxi from Northallerton?  There is a large car park at Whitegates and includes Disabled Parking near the entrance. There is a fully  accessible and clean toilet, easy to find and space to manoeuvre. There were grab rails and space for a carer. "
whites tavern belfast,negative,Not signposted as accessible but they are level access through a narrow door at the back. Just enough space for myself in a wheelchair.
whitmuir the organic place edinburgh,positive,We drove.  There are two disabled parking spaces just beside the main building .  The disabled toilets are in the main building on the left hand side as you enter through the main door.  They are spacious and have emergency red cords. See  Photo 
whitstable harbour whitstable,negative,We found parking a bit tricky - purely due to the volume of people that were obviously in Whitstable the day we visited. When we did find a spot though it was near the Harbour and it turned out to be very convenient!
whitstable harbour whitstable,positive,There are public toilets that visitors to the Harbour can use. We didn't need to use the loo - but were delighted to see a Changing Places sign!! Totally unexpected... We will definitely be recommending Whitstable Harbour as a place to visit now...
whitwell wood worksop,positive,"Bus drops people off at bottom of road so there is a half mile tarmac trek to reach the trail. Two disabled parking spaces down the hill (ignore first two car parks) and this opens out on aforementioned bumpy track to resrvoirs. If you use the bottom car park instead you will have a short, fairly steep climb to the disabled entrance on a tarmac surface."
whole foods market london,negative,"This restaurant is in the centre of London, so it's not the easiest place to access in a private vehicle. However, once you get into the restaurant it is extremely easy to access. There is limited parking available near to the venue, so the best transport route would be via taxi (plenty of which can accommodate wheelchairs around London) or via the bus."
whsmith edinburgh,negative,The Gyle Centre has lots of car parking space with dedicated disabled bays close to the main doors. The are also a variety of buses that drop off at the centre. The new tram service from the city centre has a stop at the Gyle. The Gyle centre has accessible toilets in the main concourse.
whsmith letchworth garden city,positive,The store is in the town centre and has some on street parking nearby. Car parks are not far away with level paved access.
whsmith london,negative,"There are no step-free stations nearby. The misleadingly-named Clapham Junction station, which is actually in Battersea, not Clapham, is over a mile and a half away. Several bus routes serve Clapham High St, and parking opportunities in the area are very limited."
widow cullens well lincoln,negative,"Probably no close by parking for main entrance in Steep Hill, but may be parking in Michaelsgate for back entrance.  We went by mobility scooter and walking from Castle Hill.   WARNING:  Do NOT attempt to go UP Steep Hill from the bottom in either wheelchair (probably impossible and dangerous) or a mobility scooter.  We tried the next day, and my scooter died, which was very traumatic."
widow cullens well lincoln,positive,"Accessible toilet is by the upstairs bar, so wheelchair and scooter users need to go outside and round the corner if in the downstairs bar.  Once there, all is very accessible."
wien museum karlsplatz vienna,positive,Can't comment on the parking. Karlsplatz U Bahn station (fully accessible) is three minutes from the museum on level paths through a small park.
wiener linien vienna,negative,"Some U-bahn stations have accessible toilets but in many cases you need a Euro Key to use the toilet. They are generally clean, with a grab rail by the toilet and an alarm, but vary in size."
wiener linien vienna,positive,Four stars rather than five for two reasons. (1) There are a few U-bahn stations which don't have lifts. (2) The older trams are not accessible and we sometimes had to wait a while for an accessible tram to arrive.
wightlink ferry port portsmouth,positive,"When checking in, you put hazard warning lights on, so staff are aware you need access, you are directed to a special lane, then onto the ship, where you are guided to park near the door to the lift, leaving plenty of room to get the wheelchair/rollator/walking sticks out.  This process runs smoothly and quickly. Once up in the lift to the passenger deck, there is a disabled toilet close by and friendly staff to direct you there. Signs were placed on our car when we entered the terminal making sure it was clear we needed lift access and a wheelchair.  Once on board we were directed to an extra wide space next to the lift. A ramp was put in place so we could get to the lift. There was an accessible loo on the decks we used; the door was very heavy which is. Why I deducted a star. It was also a child changing room so understandably busy, so I had to wait to use it. Otherwise well equipped."
wightlink ferry port ryde,negative,"The car lanes are entered by passing by a manned booth. Here you must give in your ticket to be scanned and always, always reiterate that you have booked a space near the lift for wheelchair access and tell them where you need extra space, ie, at the rear/side to remove a wheelchair and the driver/passenger side for exit, whichever applies. Quite often I have arrived, having booked a wheelchair accessible space only to be told that there is no record of it. (This is much more prevalent on the Portsmouth side returning to the Isle of Wight than the other way round.)  You should then be placed into a dedicated lane and when being loaded on the ferry will be asked to put on your hazard lights to make the crew on the car deck aware that you require a space near the lift and extra space to park. When parked, before alighting from your vehicle if you need space at the rear of the vehicle, always make sure that the crew allow that space with the car parked behind - many times I have found that they park other cars too close to the rear of my car.    "
wightlink ferry port ryde,positive,"The older ferries all have disabled toilets, a bit grubby with hard to open doors but with handrails and emergency cords. The new ferry has a large disabled toilet with plenty of room for a wheelchair and a carer or two. It has ample handrails, both fixed and pull down, an easily accessible sink and a well placed mirror. Each time I have used it, it has been clean and tidy. No RADAR key is necessary As a Blue Badge holder we were priority boarded and parked next to a lift.  They also ensured we were in a line right next to the terminal building and that we had plenty of space to get the wheelchair in and out.  The terminal is fully accessible though the coffee shop is across the car park.  Parking on board was easy, we were shepherded into an accessible space for the lift and a ramp was put there to combat the necessary lip from the deck door.  Staff were on hand to help and were excellent throughout. Terminal Disabled toilet accessed with the key, but are not usually kept locked.  They are clean and functional and there are plenty of staff around ready to help.  I didn't try the toilets on the ferry but they are described as accessible and are disabled designated."
wild cabaret glasgow,negative,this is almost N/A as there is no parking for the surrounding area bar an NCP multi storey car park around the corner however with good pavements etc this wouldn't be an issue to get from. the street however is quiet enough for drop off with wide smooth pavements making wheelchair use easier.
wild cabaret glasgow,positive,the toilet itself is in a large room. Appropriate bars in place and plenty of space to maneouver. it does double as a baby changing area. it isnt where the other bathrooms are but near the front entrance discretly placed and definately accessible but does seem a little out the way.
wildheart animal sanctuary sandown,negative,"There is a bus stop directly outside the zoo. The zoo is situated on Yaverland seafront very close to Sandown town centre. Parking is in a large gravelled car park. There are half a dozen disabled spaces nearer the entrance. It is privately owned and blue badge holders pay £3 to park.   The disabled toilet has enough space to move around with a carer but has a small threshold step to get into.  There is a pull down hand rail.  It is shared with baby changing and being a family orientated attraction there can be a VERY long wait to get into there. There is not a changing places toilet.  We arrived by car, the car park is very much on a par with the park itself, the parking surface and walkways are made up of broken concrete and gravel.   The accessible toilets were of a good size with plenty of room to maneuver, there is a small threshold step in the doorway but ok for an active user.  biggest disappointment was that it also doubles as a baby changing room, there was a lady in with two children (around 5 years old) which led to me having to wait outside for 10 minutes.  "
wildwood brentwood,negative,There is is no parking outside this venue but there is good disabled parking in Sainsubry's car park which is about 300 metres away. Please note parking fees apply and it closes just after the shop closes so check the website for shop hours. If you are staying later there is a dedicated diabled car park about 100 m further down William Hunter Way. Access to the Restaurant is on the High Street and if coming from Sainsubry's the Ongar Road pavement is narrow and a little uneven.
wildwood brentwood,positive,The loo is on the ground floor and has a very large door with great access for a wheelchair. The only bugbear is that it opens right onto the restaurant and the door is very heavy. But if you puit a partitionin front of the door it would limit access and such a large door is always going to be weighty.
wildwood edinburgh,negative,"There are no disabled toilets, all toilets are downstairs."
wildwood edinburgh,positive,On street parking nearby. There’s no parking outside but there are some disabled parking spaces on Grindlay Street however it gets busy. However it's possible to get dropped off there if theres no spaces left.
wildwood llandudno,positive,Easy to get to down the wide aisle. Big toilet with lots of handles. The waitress followed me down and opened the door for me although it wasnt necessary to. She was there again to hold it open when I exited too. Very thoughtful.
wilko nottingham,positive,Trent Barton Indigo stops near by. The parking in Long Eaton is also free if you have a badge and there are at least 3 car parks to choose from. 
wilks bristol,negative,Street parking on double yellows outside (but OK with blue badge). Bit tricky to get onto the pavement. There is no disabled loo which was disappointing as the they are big enough for a wheelchair and would only need the addition of bars - though access would be tight.
william cafe glasgow,negative,Only had a small coffee so the toilets were not trialed on this occasion! I'll be sure to have a couple next time so that they can get a good use!
william cafe glasgow,positive,On street parking is available outside and there are many side streets also with free parking! 
williams and johnson coffee co edinburgh,positive,"Lothian Buses 16, 22, 35 and 34 stop right outside it. It is a few minutes walk from the shore. Brand new hipster accessible loo, see picture! There is no parking in closest proximity, but the buses stop just outside the cafe."
williamson park lancaster,positive,Car Park is small and can be difficult to navigate. Disabled bay not easy to find
willow 10 chalet benderloch,positive,Not sure about public transport access but no problem parking in the dedicated parking space outside the chalet. Very good bathroom which suited my needs very well. It may be worth bringing your shower chair depending on your needs. Room for 2 cars outside your chalet.
willow tea rooms glasgow,negative,There is a NCP multi storey car park 3 min walk away.
willows coffee shop dundee,positive,"There are around 4 council car parks dotted around Broughty Ferry where there are plenty of accessible parking spaces and blue badge holders are able to park for free. There is also onstreet parking available and parking available beside Broughty Ferry beach which is around a 10-minute walk away from the main high street.  At the other end of the main high street there is a taxi rank, when I regulary walk past I have noticed there are usually at least 2 WAV taxis. Buses that run from Dundee to around Angus stop on the main road beside the main high street. There is a train station in Broughty Ferry however, I’m not sure how frequently trains stop here. There is an accessible toilet at Willows with baby changing facilities inside. It has a standard lock on it but, isn’t extremely spacious. I feel a wheelchair user would struggle if they needed assistance from someone. The toilet is positioned closer to the far corner of the accessible toilet which means that if someone can only transfer from the right-hand side they may struggle. I think the sink is at a reasonable height for wheelchair users however, I feel the pipes underneath might prevent wheelchair users to get in close enough. The emergency red cord was hanging freely and I attached a red cord.  In Broughty Ferry there is a Changing Places toilet down near the beach which is roughly a 10-minute walk away. This facility is open different times of the year depending on what season it is."
willows coffee shop perth,negative,There are no disabled parking spaces very close to the venue but all are within reachable distance.  It is fairly close to a local bus route.
willows coffee shop perth,positive,"Accessible toilet is good, but gaining access is a little tricky. Disabled loo on the ground floor, you do need to open two doors however.  Spacious enough, could do with a slightly higher toilet."
wilson cottage tavistock,negative,"The toilet was spotlessly clean. Again, not an accessible loo but did have a grab bar near the toilet, grab bars and movable seat in the shower cubicle which was accessed over one small step."
wilson cottage tavistock,positive,"You can park your car outside the front door, It is then no more than 10 feet to the front door."
wimbledon   all england lawn tennis and croquet club london,negative,"*Shudder*. First of all, the good news: it's easy to get a parking place on the day in the allocated field for blue badge holders across the road from the venue, and they had laid down a plastic walkway this year to help you get from your car up to the road without having to cross too much grass or other uneven surfaces. The problem is getting there: the trains and tube in London are 90% useless for wheelchair-users, so we have to endure a long, hot, slow drive through cramped residential roads to get to the Wimbledon tennis from where we live in the north of the city. It's a good job it's a fun day out when you get there, because this has almost put us off going again. There are no accessible stations near by, yet Blue Badge users receive no discount on the official carpark charge of £25 if booked in advance of the Championships opening, or £30 cash on the day. Despite the high charge, access within and from the carpark is highly problematic, with a mud and gravel track that wheelchair users share with cars, and which is particularly steep and uneven at the top. There is no pedestrian crossing and no stewards assigned to the road, which makes crossing over to the ground frightening and dangerous. However, a buggy service does operate within the carpark. The toilets are Radar-key operated, which cuts down on misuse, but queues are still common. The 'accessible' toilets vary in size, and the entry to the sole accessible toilet on Court 1 is off the corridor to the rest of the toilets which makes getting in and out and waiting problematic. When I visited the emergency cord had been tucked behind the pipes, so I left a Euan's Guide card explaining how it operated and needed to be maintained."
wimbledon   all england lawn tennis and croquet club london,positive,"There is disabled parking available relatively near the entrance. The roads nearby are busy so allow plenty time  A reasonable sized toilet at Court 1 and a fantastic Changing Places toilet close by. Radar keys are given out on arrival at the main entrance.  I drove to Wimbledon in my drive from Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle (WAV) but the traffic at 10.30 was relatively quiet with queuing traffic only on the last approach to the car park. Disabled car parking is pre bookable and costs £25 but it is well worth it as you are parked as near to the entrance to the court you are allocated tickets to. You are warned in advance the ground is rough and you may  need help over the ground and on to the metal ramps. This is standard for other outdoor venues. I have fortunately managed to get one ticket and a free companion seat via the ballot in 2015 (Court 3) and 2018 (Centre Court). On both occasions the toilets were very close to the allocated seating, operated only by radar key (staff all carried radar keys in case you forgot your own or your could borrow a key for the day). Toilets were regularly cleaned and were spacious. There is one toilet with a full changing facility with space for 2 carers to assist. I wish I had taken photos Particularly good accessible loos on Centre Court, where they're right near the wheelchair seats and it feels like hardly anyone else is using them. The ones I used around Court No 1 were clean and reasonably spacious too, and opened with RADAR keys. "
wimborne model town dorset,positive,"Well signed and ramped. Shared with baby changing so manoeuvring the wheelchair wasn’t simple and the loo grab rail wasn’t really accessible. As usual, the loo roll holder was behind the seat! "
wimpole estate arrington,negative,"Nearby parking. Not enough of them Disabled parking is available close to the courtyard and house. When we visited, a lot of the disabled spaces were taken by vans belonging to the traders at the craft fair, which seemed rather unfair. The disabled toilet in the courtyard is in a narrow area, which might be difficult to turn a chair in. I'm able to get out of my chair if I have to, so I managed OK. The toilet wasn't particularly nice or clean, but it was spacious."
windermere lake cruises bowness on windermere,negative,"We parked in the long stay carpark which is quite a long way away. Blue badge holders get 1 hour extra free. 12 hours of car parking cost £7. Finding the loos on the jetty can be a challenge. The RADAR loo in Windermere had 2 bins which needed to be removed before I could get my chair in. On return busstop for the  555 no dropped kerbside at Waterhead. Also driver refused to take us on same bus with 2 wheelchairs.  Also very dangerous crossing the road at waterhead, no crossing lights.  We wouldn't attempt this again.  Just on the pier at Waterhead and Bowness."
windermere lake cruises bowness on windermere,positive,good parking no toilets onboard but there are nearby use a radar key
windmill community campus kirkcaldy,positive,Blue badge parking at the main door. Ample on site parking. Service bus stops at the main gate.  Visitor and pupil toilets have dedicated accessible toilets. Large circulation and side transfer spaces. All rails and red cord. 
windsor castle windsor,negative,"Easily accessible by train, bus or car. There is no disabled parking at Windsor Castle. The nearest disabled bays are on the high street but there is rarely one free. Most of the available parking is by the river which means a long, steep uphill walk to the castle. All 3 disabled toilets at the castle require a RADAR key. I used the accessible toilet in Engine Court. Access to the toilet is not flat and it would be extremely difficult to unlock and open the door without assistance from a carer. No disabled parking outside the castle for space and security reasons. I was fortunate to find a disabled space on the street opposite the castle entrance. Ther is none on site, it is what parking you can find within Windsor eg normal car parks and just park."
windsor castle windsor,positive,"Very good, roomy"
wingham wildlife park wingham,negative,"Parking is on a compacted field/soil surface. 6 spaces for blue badge holders on the left of the entrance on the same ground. Drop off recommended. Smooth path to the new ticket centre entrance. Two toilets with wheelchair access. Two toilets with step free cubicles for men, 1 toilet cubicle block step free for women, 1 toilet block with one step for women. No light on the women's toilet and my husband paddled through liquid in the men's' by the tortoises. I used the wheelchair accessible toilet here. Very large, gritty floor due to the outside terrain. Not a full compliment of support rails. You have to be a gibbon to reach the toilet paper. Lift up tap to get water flow."
wings edinburgh,negative,Its in the centre of town meaning parking is difficult and during certain times in summer would be almost impossible.
winston solicitors leeds,negative,"Level access to main toilets on ground floor, but not disable friendly. Disable friendly on lower floor with space and grab handles."
winston solicitors leeds,positive,Plenty of onsite parking. At Front two bays close to a ramp to front door.
winter gardens blackpool,negative,Not sure there is any designated parking but plenty of parking spaces in town within walking distance. Not sure of toiletting situation but there is a changing place in Blackpool tower which is a minutes walk away.
winter gardens blackpool,positive,"Getting to the Winter Gardens for us was a short wheel from the railway station. Several folk were arriving by taxi and being dropped off at the door. The other option may be to walk up from the tram stop or the nearby bus stops. There was an accessible loo in the corridor adjacent to the Spanish Hall. It was clean, spacious and fit for purpose."
wistow maze leicester,positive,The venue had disabled parking closest to the café as well as directly next to the maze entrance. The disabled facilities were clearly marked and staff were dotted around to help out if needed. The toilets were located in a small cabin with stairs and a ramp. Very easy access.
witch alm niederau,positive,"We skied to it, but it was very close to the slopes and had space to store our sit ski's.  The mini bus that picked us up after had plenty space to turn and load us."
wolds village driffield,positive,We travelled by motorhome and the venue is just off a main road and the car park is quite big. We easily parked our 7m vehicle there. The car park is on a slight slope and there are good paths going down to the tea rooms and gallery. The toilets were across the courtyard and there was enough space to get a wheelchair plus dog between all the tables. The accessible toilet was clean and a good size. 
wolds way lavender malton,positive,"The Farm has plenty of parking with wide spaces, close to the entrance which are suitable for disable visitors. Toilets are access by a flat narrow walkway. "
wollaton hall and deer park nottingham,positive,"Great parking facilities, plenty of blue badge parking, but the car park does consist of small stones so they can be a bit of a pain for wheelchair users. Spacious, well maintained and close to the restaurant."
womad music festival charlton,positive,"Awesome. The car park is close to the main campsite for people with disabilities, on grass, but the ground is flat and even in wet conditions is accessible, so you can drop off all your gear right by your tent and park nearby. There are accessible disabled mobile loos and showers available both on the main site and also on the disabled campsite, and these are regularly serviced and clean."
womankind charlie miller edinburgh,positive,I got there on my mobility scooter.  There isn't dedicated parking but there is a bus stop just outside and on-street parking.
wood nook caravan park skipton,negative,"The journey here was okay. We came, as advised by the site, from Skipton up a B road to Grassington, which was fine. You turn left off this road in Thresfields, up a long dead end. Initially, this is a normal road but the last km or so is the narrowest single track road ever! I was driving the car and had to do a double take. Hubby was following in the motorhome. He must have wondered where we were going. Glad we took the car, as days out, getting the motorhome up and down that lane would have been stressful!"
woodford leisure centre hull,positive,"Eight disabled bays in car park, with pedestrianised area for safety. Plenty of shelter/ scooter racks opposite entrance. Good bus links as situated on main road (Holderness Road). Main reception area: Contained one disabled changing place with shower and toilet, and a separate disabled toilet. The changing place was spacious and equipped with shower, wall mounted electronic changing bed, tracking with overhead ceiling hoist, electric adjustable sink and mirror unit (with curved basin for ease of access) with easy reach long handled tap, toilet with grab rails, and emergency red cord within reach, and screen for privacy. The disabled toilet included lowered sink, toilet, grab rails, emergency red cord. Observed to be clean and tidy throughout.   Main and teaching pool changing/ toilet facilities:  Three disabled shower rooms, all in use during visit therefore staff member advised one was equipped with hoist, and two with shower seats. One separate disabled toilet. Spacious and flat access to pool areas from changing room, with PoolPod access into swimming pools.  Leisure pool changing/ toilet facilities: Separate family/disabled changing room, with benches. Two disabled toilets fitted out identically to previous disabled toilet. "
woodhorn museum ashington,positive,The website advised not to use the postcode but follow the brown signs.  This we did and got there with no bother.  There was a large car park adjacent to the entrance to the museum site which had a number of disabled bays play an ev charging point. There were accessible toilets inside the main building but I did not use them and therefore the score I have allocated may be incorrect.  From what I read on the website there is also a changing places unit which is superb.
woodstock coffee shop woodstock,negative,i did not use the toilet
woodstock coffee shop woodstock,positive,"i do not have a blue badge as i was not approved for that. however i find that local buses in oxford and the countyr are very good and most of the bus drivers are very helpful, also chiltern railways from oxford parkway station"
woodstock road baptist church oxford,positive,"Parking is available on site for those who require it, with plenty of road side parking at weekends for those who do not need to park at the church, with reserved spaces. A reading of four only because there site is space constrained and so their are less parking spaces than desired site to council restrictions. One large toilet with required handled and space to turn wheelchair. Other toilets are available. Not five in score as shared toilet with baby change; but they have their needs too!"
woodstock woodstock,negative,"The main car park involves a walk to the old quarters, and it’s almost impossible to park along it’s main streets, but you never know, you may just find a spot. It’s at least worth driving through to see the old historical buildings, and to get the best view of Blenheim Palace.  These will only be available in main car park, we did not visit."
woody nook at woodcote woodcote,positive,Plenty of parking space
wookey hole caves and attractions wells,positive,They have a good sized car park which has a few disabled spaces and a main car park which is nearer to the entrance has a couple of disabled spaces outside the hotel. They have a accessible toilet next to the car park spaces and inside the main building. 
worcestershire county museum hartlebury,negative,"It was very basic, but clean enough, with pull cord and grab rails. "
worcestershire county museum hartlebury,positive,"A lovely driveway leads to the house, with reasonable parking, although we only saw four disabled bays."
worcestershire county museum hartlebury castle,positive,Parking on the flat next to the entrance for bade holders. A number of accessible toilets with a variety of fittings and space sizes - very well described on their web-site.
world museum liverpool,negative,We took a Taxi from the city centre to the museum which cost about £4.00 however there are a number of local buses that pass by the doors of the Museum and the local tour buses that take you on the city tour also stop in the area as well. Did not notice any Blue badge parking in the area the nearest large car park is some distance away  A few free disabled bays near entrance but it's a bit of a battle to get one. Some ordinary Pay & Display £5 over 2 hours.
world museum liverpool,positive,"Arrived by Merseyrail who were not up to their usual standard, as assistance was a bit variable.  Got off at Central Station.  The changing place was fine but looses one point as it was located on the first floor which meant waiting for a lift up and down. See previous comments.  There is a wheelchair accessible toilet on every floor and a wonderful changing places facility on the 1st floor all of the toilets have good signage and the 2 that we looked at were clean and useable  It was strange that the café is on the ground floor as male and female toilets but no accessible toilet ? This might be the place most people would look for one after having a tea or coffee      Well signposted accessible disabled toilets. Adequate room for carer. A bit careworn, but adequate and reasonably clean."
worms head gower,positive,By road it is relatively simple although some roads are a little narrow in places. Large car park free for National Trust members. Accessible loo at the car park with radar key.
worthing leisure centre lancing,negative,Nearest bus stop just down the road.
wroxton house hotel banbury,negative,"We arrived from the Banbury area, and main A422, and you pass this delightful hotel as you enter Wroxton village, but you need to drive round the bend to find its car park. The entrance itself gives you a feeling that all is going to be well.  You can be dropped off by foyer entrance while driver parks up, or park yourself before making your way into hotel. However, the car park area is on a stoney and rough area, we found it hard work to get across to foyer, so lower marks given at this time for parking. If it happens to be raining on your visit you may not be very pleased about that by the time you get into hotel, as we found no disabled area provided near the foyer. But please do not let that spoil this delightful little hotel visit for you, stick it out and you will really enjoy your visit. The disabled toilet is on reception desk level, but steps to get up to get you there, (photo provided) but staff will provide the use of the ramp to help you. You have to enter a passageway via a door, and you will need help to open it. The disabled toilet itself is smallish, but very clean, and a grab rail is provided, but you will not be able to manoeuvre much in there, (photo provided). "
wuff dublin,positive,"Good accessible bathroom, but a steep ramp to get up to it"
wwt arundel wetland centre arundel,negative,The Disabled toilet is a standard disabled toilet This is no good for us as we need a Hoist assisted toilet with and adult changing bench which they did not have
wwt arundel wetland centre arundel,positive,"Lots of wheelchair accessible spaces large car park with plenty of dedicated disabled parking spaces. Flat and consisting of packed earth, perfectly accessible.  A large disabled toilet is situated in the cafe. Plenty of room to accommodate a carer and wheelchair. Well placed handrails, both fixed and pull down. Clean, tidy and well looked after Plenty of disabled parking bays, easy access "
wwt castle espie wetland centre comber,negative,"I walked from a nearby house, the roads are very narrow and widey, you are taking your own life in your hands. Public transport is non existent. But there is a large car park available.  "
wwt castle espie wetland centre comber,positive,See pic
wwt llanelli wetlands llanelli,negative,"Whilst the venue had a bus stop, there was no scheduled buses operating to and from it. Closest bus stop with a scheduled bus service was 1.5 miles away, along a route not suitable for wheelchairs (part of route with no pavement, no drop-down kerb where pavement ends and pavement recommences), the footpath from the railway bridge has a full width gate that is locked, and a side zig zag that is very hard to get a wheelchair around. One path also has a boulder which reduces the width, only way to pass with wheelchair is to ride into the nettles next to the path.  Parking, there are 10 disabled parking bays provided at the front, but these bays are 2400mm wide with no wheelchair hatched areas, which makes them unsuitable for wheelchair users when the venue is busy. "
wwt llanelli wetlands llanelli,positive,"large  car park with many disabled parking bays large disabled toilet centrally located, but no hoist or change bed Parking was near the facility and easy to use, there were spaces The toilet was clean, easy to access, next to the other toilets and had loads of information inside about the reuse of water, very informative as well as very easy to use. By car, disabled parking right outside entrance Two disabled loos with space for carer."
wwt martin mere wetland centre burscough,positive,Approximately 25 disabled spaces available Disabled toilets are accessible but only the ones where you can transfer or be transferred are available. No changing facilities for adults that need hoisting. Quite a few disabled parking bays but could have done with more  There is a free car park with several designated accessible bays. I used the accessible toilet by the cafe.  It had enough space to manoeuvre & grab rails on the wall. It was clean & tidy.
wwt slimbridge wetland centre slimbridge,positive,Plenty of disabled parking. As far as I am aware - there is no public transport to the site.There is parking for coaches as well as cars. Lots of disabled parking. I don't think you could get there via public transport -even if you can use public transport Properly equipped disabled toilets. And I liked that there was a toilet block in the car park including a disabled toilet. If like me you always need the loo once you've arrived this is good
wycombe leisure centre high wycombe,positive,plenty of free disabled parking on the first floor of parking garage.  Also new park and ride is right there as well so can easily get to by bus. Seperate disabled loo and changing area.  Full wet room.
wyevale garden centre diss,positive,Very large hard surfaced car park with Blue Badge spaces.
wyevale garden centre oswestry,positive,"Good parking, quite a number of disabled parking spaces."
wykham park farm banbury,negative,"The entire Farm and shop was not appealing, the parking area was rather untidy looking with quite a few pot holes. In all honesty we did not bother to try to find it as found whole area not at all impressive, so we forget to check it out."
wymondham alpacas wymondham,positive,"The Alpacas are at Centre Paws a dog friendly place with a cafe, toilets, camping, dog walks, dog agility and other dog related services. There is a large car park with a relatively level surface. No disabled places marked but I have never seen the car park full. You can also, if needed actually park right by the cafe if you ask."
wyndhams theatre london,negative,"The toilet was not easy to find and it was not sign posted. The toilet was in a storage cupboard , there was only one grab rail. There would have not been enough space to transfer from chair to toilet. There was not some for a carer or a changing place. The toilet did not operate a red cord system  or alert at all. "
wyvern theatre swindon,positive,"we always take a work vehicle that is a transit van for 3 or 4 residents in wheelchairs, and there is parking out the back right next to the easily accessible entrance, the theatre has its own car park which needs to be paid for in the day and evening otherwise it is a 15 min walk from the train and bus station"
yafford mill barn self catering yafford,positive,Perfect in a car. Parking right by the house with a paved area where you can put your car if a solid surface is needed. Great! Multiple handles and a good space. Beautifully tiled and decorated.
yanns at glenearn house crieff perth,negative,"Disappointing.  The toilet was lovely and clean, but very little thought had been put in to disabled access.  A handrail had been put on the wall but it was so far from the toilet you'd have no chance in reaching it.  No red cord and the toilet was just of standard height. Lighting was very dark, I'm sure it was atmospheric, but could be hard for any one with sight issues."
yanns at glenearn house crieff perth,positive,"There is a large carpark.  However it is a funny shape, no marked out bays, if they are busy you could get a little stuck.  I definitely recommend reversing into a space if you can."
yates york,negative,There is no parking facilities at Yates but a nearby bus stop that our group used as we travelled to the restaurant using public transport. 
ye olde starre inne york,positive,"Shoehorned into small area but big enough for standard hand wheelchair. Access by gradual easy ramp, tight right then tight left turn at top. Unsuitable for mobility scooters"
yearsley pool york,negative,"one relatively spacious disabled toilet, hand rails/bars etc included - happy to see."
yearsley pool york,positive,"Due to the layout/design of the building, toilets are situated pool-side (though bear in mind this is an Edwardian building). There is a disabled access toilet and changing facilities. The swimming pool is situated just off Haxby Road, a main road through York, on Haley's Terrace. It has plenty of parking available, along with disabled parking bays just to the right of the main entrance. The swimming pool is accessible by public transport on bus routes 1  or 5, with the bus stop 70 metres away The Toilet is situated in the specially design and adapted disabled changing room located at poolside just 2m from the pool. The toilet is unisex. The door of the changing room opens inwards. There are numerous well situated grab rails in the changing room along with a fold out table/bench and a shower with shower seat, there is also a functioning emergency alarm and disposal facilities available. Standard toilets are also available. parking available near the pool All toilets and changing facilities are located opposite the shallow end of the pool. The disabled facilities are 2 metres from the pool edge and hoist- both changing place and toilet are located in the same room. There is a transfer space to the right of the toilet and a fold away hand rail is at the left hand side. There are vertical hand rails either side of both the mirror and the sink. There is a seat and a back rest in the showering area with a horizontal handrail to the left of the shower seat and another horizontal handrail to the left of the shower unit."
yellows american bar grill norwich,positive,"Parking available outside club shop, at the back of the ground and on the road. Easy to use, clean and a good size."
yen rotunda glasgow,negative,Quite a large car park and ramp to door but completely packed with cars close together and on kerbs - possibly being used by attendees to the SECC complex for Take That concert night
yew tree farm shopping village wotton wawen,positive,"Parking is available quite close to converted buildings, and mostly on the level, even if over bumpy pot holed areas which offer no problems at all as to getting around."
yha ambleside hostel ambleside,negative,"There is disabled parking spaces but they were usually taken by non blue badgers and the staff were not helpful in tracking down the owners. I was allowed to park in a ""do not park here"" place blocking entrance to the watersports hut but at least we had a place. Call in advance and ask them to reserve the space."
yha the sill at hadrians wall hexham,positive,There's a car park with blue badge spaces outside the hostel and landscape discovery centre (which share the same eco-friendly building). We also saw modern local buses stopping there several times a day.  Good clean spacious loos with rails in the en suite bathroom and in the communal dining room.
york art gallery exhibition square,negative,"This isn't great.  you have to park in the nearest council car park which is on Bootham and tends to get busy.  It does have blue badge spaces but not many.  The route out of the car park is bumpy and the pavement isn't wide enough for a wheelchair in places so you have to use the road.  This isn't a reflection on the art gallery but is something to be aware of it you're visiting Parking is 5 minutes away. I don't drive so unsure about what the provision is like. They were also unclear if they had any spaces closer.   Accessible by bus - stop directly outside the gallery. 2 entrances both with ramped access. Good level access and wide corridor but only 1 designated accessible toilet. Clean, well kept."
york art gallery exhibition square,positive,"Plenty of parking available although some are liable to flooding, but you can easily find the relevent informationfor this. I only travel by car but I know that there is a good train service. Getting about the city by powerchair is difficult because of the pavements. York also has many ancient  walkways so be prepared for the bumps - best when it is quiet. No real problems other than I was conscious of people going past and some noise from reception. I am hyper sensitive to noise so probably in the minority. The dryers are too noisy for me to use and I carry a microfibre towel. I would prefer paper towels and a larger loo but no real complaints."
york art gallery york,positive,On site parking is free and buses stop outside this  venue  We had a taxi from the Railway Station and we were dropped off at the door of the Art Gallery. Accessible Loos were spacious and spotlessly clean.
york castle museum york,positive,Used York Shopmobilty to hire a scooter and they provided their own parking spaces in Piccadilly car par.  Scan blue badge on exit and parking is free. There is the castle car park just next to museum with ample disabled parking spaces and it is possible to be driven to the door to be dropped off if the distance across the car park is too far to walk All toilets were signposted and staff are on hand to direct if necessary. Parking for blue badge holders is free and on the road right outside the main entrance (not signposted). There are disabled parking spaces in the car park which is a 2-3 minute walk. 
york cocoa works york,positive,"In the centre of York, there is on street parking with blue badge. Nearby bus stops and not far from the trainstation (10 min walk) As mentioned above, staff were helpful and offered to remove the changing table but it was fine. Easy to get in and out, very clean and tidy. There was a red cord next to the toilet hanging to the floor, everything was easy to access. There were grab rails. "
york designer outlet york,negative,"There are two main sets of toilets. If you go straight on from the accessible parking entrance, there are some toilets on the right, which includes a RADAR locked changing places. This always used to be spotless but didn't seem that clean today. On the other side, near Starbucks are some more toilets. There is an accessible one but it is right next to the ladies and is nearly always full. This means waiting such that wheelchair and dog completely block the entrance to the ladies. Seems a poor design really. Also, that one always stinks. Even my dog takes a sharp intake of breath!"
york designer outlet york,positive,"Lots of parking available, and disabled parking spaces near to the entrance. Bus stop also very close to entrance, so very convenient if using public transport. Large accessible toilets with grab rails, and plenty of space for a carer if necessary. The is plenty of disabled parking spaces next to the entrance. The parking bays are wide and the kerbs up onto the pavement are dropped to allow easy access for users Large spacious toilets with grab rails, a raised toilet seat and wash hand basin. The shopping centre has disabled toilets on both the first and ground floor There is a sign of mobility of which if you follow it then leads to a car park with plenty of parking spaces just for disabled people. It is level floor from the parking to accessing the entrance with automatic doors. Large toilets with grab rails fitted at the right places, has raised toilet seat, has plenty of space for a wheelchair to move around. Clean and well maintained. There are available disabled toilets on both floors and in both sides. Designated 'blue badge' parking area - south entrance. I have commented on 'no mirror' at east entrance toilet - it is being refurbished at present. All other toilets are fabulous - for me personally! The outlet had a specific 'blue badge' parking area. But finding a space within the other car parks can be difficult especially during peak times as the car parks can become very busy. The toilet used was the one opposite café Nero, they have recently been redone and have a good sized wheelchair accessible toilet. Accessible parking isn't signposted until you actually arrive at it, but we know where it is, so we were fine. There are plenty of spaces and it is clean and open, with level access through automatic doors into the centre. There are pebbled areas around the parking which are great for toileting my assistance dog before going in. Park and Ride site so regular low floor buses from various stops around York. Lots of disabled parking spaces. If you follow the signs for mobility then there is a mini car park just for blue badge holders. Flat access from car park to entrance. Separate disabled toilet without baby changing. Disabled toilet has bars in all the right places. Always clean and well maintained though. Still used by parents with kids despite the lack of baby changing."
york district hospital york,positive,at least 30 spaces out the front generally good but quite far away from the main reception relatively
york explore library and archive york,negative,"Driving, travel by car:  There are 2 parking bays for blue badge holders that are using the library, with a maximum stay of 2 hours. You do not need to book in advance to park. The bays are outside the library entrance, meaning there is no road to cross from the car park to the entrance. The surface is tarmac and level, consequently it is suitable for wheelchair users.   Public transport: There is a bus stop just a a minute round the corner from the library's entrance. "
york explore library and archive york,positive,"Coming out of the lift upstairs, there is a disabled toilet. To gain access to the toilet, a key from reception is required. The toilet door is light to open, has a handle lock and inside there is sufficient room to transfer. The toilet offers a rail and a drop down rail either side of the toilet to assist transfers, a sanitary disposal bin and a large mirror, a low level sink with a lever tap and an emergency alarm pull cord.  There is a changing room specifically designated for people with a disability. Unfortunately the date i went, it was out of use as it is under construction. Although it will be completed in the near future."
york maze york,negative,"Very small, no changing area and dirty."
york maze york,positive,Very easy to find and lots disabled parking right by entrance.  Around 20 spots.
york minster york,negative,"Important to keep in mind York central is very busy, there is no car parking or bus stops right outside though it is still an option. Disabled parking are a 5 min walk and if you're coming from the train station is a very easy to find about a 5 min walk! not sure about these - more room maybe!!"
york minster york,positive,"I used train return from Edinburgh, the Minster by walking with a cane was only 10 minutes from the Train Station, York is so compact that once you leave the Minster you have the rest of old town on your doorstep. I did not use these facilities in the Minster or in York but they were clearly marked, staff and members of the public offered help if I passed by or where close to one. Disabled toilets were available, including a hand rail and space to maneuvering a wheel chair. We didn't use the toilet facilities during our visit and I don't remember seeing any signs for such but we did visit the 'Silver Street toilets while I the city centre and was pleasantly surprised by a full changing places facility despite not being badged as such (radar key entry) transport able to drive right up to outside. caution with length of stay though. The closest bus stop is 0.2 miles away. Buses provide disabled access.  As the building attracts many visitors per day I thought there should be more disabled toilets. However the toilets provided were large enough to maneuver a wheelchair and for a carer and service user can both move around easily, grab rails were also provided.  Public transport is very convenient. It has disabled access and the nearest bus stop is 0.2 miles away.  Disabled toilets were easy to access as there is enough room to manoeuvre a wheelchair as well as it including a hand rail.  A standard disabled toilet was available with hand rails and adequate space to manoeuvre a wheelchair inside."
york railway station york,negative,"There are very few disabled toilets available at the station. There are relatively few disabled toilets available at this train station, however those that are there have level access from platforms 2 and 9. There are both male and female disabled toilets found on platform 1, however locating these is not easy due to lack of signage. The disabled ladies toilet is a cubicle inside the ladies toilets. The door to the toilets is push button operated. The cubicle was wide enough to fit a wheelchair into but maybe difficult to turn a wheelchair around in, possibly making transfers harder. The facilities inside the cubicle were good, with a raised toilet, grab rails and a button and pull cords for assistance. There was no cubicle for changing other than the baby changing rooms. Disabled parking bays at the side of railway station. Automatic door to toilets, only one fairly small disabled toilet."
york railway station york,positive,"The transport links are 5 star at this venue, there are a number of public transport links located at he entrance of the station. A taxi rank that provides drop off and pick up points directly outside the entrance. This taxi rank is also equipt with taxis that can accommodate wheelchair users. There are also a number of bus stops outside the venue that provide transport to a number of locations. If using own transport there are a number of disabled parking spaces and the pavements are lowered from here to the entrance of the station so it is accessible for wheelchair users. There are both male and female disabled toilets located in the station although these could be made more accessible by have more signs to make them easier to find. Inside the toilets they are accessible for wheelchair users but it could be made easier for a wheelchair user to use by creating more space so they can move around easier. The station has a pick up and drop for impaired mobility. Directly outside the entrance to the station is a taxi rank which is all flat surfaces and wheelchair taxis are available on request. There is a short stay and a long stay car park next to the station with disabled access to the station which wheelchair users can use unaided. Toilet was huge, had a hoist, changing bed and height adjustable sink. Toilet flush wasnt great. Lots of space for a carer- you could fit a whole family in there! I used the train to get to York, but there is a good local bus service and also long distance buses serve the station as well. I have not used the car park so cannot comment on disabled parking. It may be as well to contact the station directly before travelling to ascertain the availability of disabled parking spaces.  Because I had used Passenger Assist I was met by a member of station staff ,my wheel chair was taken down the ramp and I was assisted to the concourse. All brilliant service.  The Accessible toilets are adjacent to Platform 2 and between Platforms 8 and 9; these toilets are operated by a RADAR key and a RADAR key is available from station staff. Public transport is easily accessible from the railway station with a taxi rank and a bus stop directly opposite. There are also disabled parking spaces are available just outside the station. Wide electronic doors allowing access to the toilets are manually operated by a large button placed just below waist height, allowing easy reach for wheelchair users. In terms of disabled parking within the train station there is a number of disabled parking spaces within the car park at a reasonable distance from the station itself. As well as this there is also a drop off point outside of the main entrance which therefore will allow individuals to be dropped off right outside of the building if necessary. Within the station there are wheelchair accessible toilets fully equipped to allow easy use. Including a lowered sink and hand dryer. Both the short and long stay car parks are situated next to the station with disabled access into the station, which independent wheelchair users are able to use unaided. This station also offers impaired mobility pick up points. The taxi rank is just at the front of the station, with level access from the main entrance, and offers accessible and wheelchair taxis, though there may be a wait for these. The station itself is easily accessible by public or own transport. There are bus stops outside the station that are on routes covering nearly all of York. There is a taxi rank based at the station, to allow visitors to York to be able to hail a taxi just outside the station. Those arriving at the station in their own car, there is abundance of disabled parking bays with direct access to the platform. All pavements leading to the station have lowered kerbs and tactile paving surfaces at all crossings. All the pedestrian crossings at the station are zebra or pelican crossings. Transport to York station is provided by providing a taxi drop off and pick up lane, this is located right outside the entrance to the station.There are also bus stops which provides buses to a number of locations in york. If using your own car disabled parking spaces are provided and lowered pavements are evident, this makes it easier to access the platform. Both male and female toilets are located inside the station. However a sign inside the station might help in finding these easier. The toilets provide access for wheelchair users, however could be made easier to use if more space was provided to move around."
york st john students union york,negative,"There is no parking directly outside the students union, however there is disabled parking on the University site which is around a 5 minute walk. Although this is very limited and may take longer depending on the individual. Disabled parking available at about 300 yards, closest bus stop is 800 yards away. Level access from car park and bus stop to the venue. "
york st john students union york,positive,There is one disabled toilet situated in the students union which has a lot of space. Accessible loo easy to find. Very spacious with room for baby changing included. Grab rails around the toilet. 
york theatre royal york,negative,"There is no onsite parking, the nearest car park is off Bootham.  A number of buses stop immediately outside and taxis tend to use the bus stop to drop off.  There is a taxi rank around the corner. There is no parking for the theatre but there is a drop-off space outside where the kerb is lowered. Depending on your mobility, you could also do what we did - got dropped off in Duncombe Place round the corner where there is plenty of space then scooted round. We visited in an accessible taxi - parking near the theatre is not good. Also, there was a problem of no fully dropped curb outside the main entrance. I only visited the accessible toilet on the dress circle (1st floor level). Once inside everything is as expected but the sign from one side of the bar, where my seat was, to the other side (where the toilet is) is non-existant.  Due to this theatre being located in the city centre and on a main road, there is limited car parking. There are, however, spaces to park on Duncombe Place if you are a blue badge holder, which is located to the rear of the theatre. There is also a bus stop directly outside the theatre so public transport could be an option."
york theatre royal york,positive,"Although not very noticeable, there are limited blue badge parking spaces located at the back of the theatre, but the distance from the car park to the building is appropriate Very easy to find the toilet and in a great location. The wheelchair is able to fit through on observation and appears to be easy to navigate around. The toilet contains a red alarm pull cord for emergency purposes. Ground floor loo easy to find as well sign-posted, and there is another at Dress Circle level. Spacious and with plenty of grabrails. Only issue is you can't reach the hand dryer without manoeuvring chair/scooter with wet hands.  Two accessible toilets, one on the ground floor and another on the dress circle level."
yorkshire air museum york,positive,When entering the museum in the car there is a hut where you make payments for all of your entries. The staff at this hut are very friendly and helpful and point you in the right direction of parking. There are disables parking bays located at the very front of the car park.  Fully accessible toilets in the toilet block. Toilet blocks very clean and well maintained.
yorkshire childrens centre huddersfield,positive,"The car park lacks disabled bays, but the venue is directly next to the train station, with several bus stops nearby too. Lacking full changing facilities but otherwise excellent."
yorkshire event centre harrogate,positive,"Ample parking on site. The site is also on the bus route.  Lots of accessible loos around the site which are well sign posted and visible from a distance. As previously mentioned in this review they also have a ""Rolls-Royce"" of Changing Places in the exhibition hall which has the best equipment and is extremely large.  Excellent disabled parking with plenty of space between vehicles for a wheelchair. Excellent, the event centre has recently installed a changing place facility making days out more accessible for all.  Without this it is difficult to enjoy family days out."
yorkshire museum york,positive,"Good access to the one disabled toilet, but there can be queues at busy periods"
yorkshire sculpture park wakefield,negative,There is no cost for the park but you have to pay for the parking and it is up to £8 for the day or £5 for 1-2 hours. Our advice to anyone with a wheelchair is to park in the smaller car park rather than the main visitor park.
yorkshire sculpture park wakefield,positive,"spacious and clean We drove and parked in one of the plentiful blue badge spaces outside the visitor centre. Only possible drawback was having to pay - blue badge holders have to pay too.  No objection to paying but a disabled visitor on their own would need to get to and use the paystation. Accessible loos in visitor centre and at entrance to country park. Possibly at other points too but I didn't see them.  One in visitor centre was spacious, well equipped, clean. Apparently the country park one is radar key entry (the visitor centre one is not)."
yorkshire wildlife park doncaster,negative,"There are various disabled accessible toilets within the park, however there is not one at the car park meaning that you have to walk into the park first to find this. They are all level access and large, with wide doors making it easy for a wheelchair user and carer(s) to be present. In the Safari Cafe toilet, I noticed a hoist, which is ideal if this is required. However, there is not a hoist present in every toilet facility. The toilets themselves are high, which is beneficial for anybody transferring from a wheelchair to the toilet with assistance.  at the main entrance and in the café there were accessible toilets that were easy to find with plenty of room to move around and space for me to help my nan.   we found all toilets easy to access. Please see my main comments. Although there is a bus route, I would not recommend it. We went by car and it seemed like it'd be a very long walk from the main road into the park. Disabled parking is not signed till you are there. The disabled spaces are not marked out and on uneven gravel/mud surface full of big puddles. Around 20 disabled parking spaces are available directly outside the entrance. At busy times the spaces will be full, so it may be necessary to park in an ordinary space. There is a drop off point at the entrance.  Buses do travel to the park but there will be a 10 minute walk from bus stop to park entrance. There is one disabled toilet just inside the entrance of the park, which is also a baby changing unit. This can mean a long wait! Some portaloos are available at other places around the park but they appeared to be unsuitable for wheelchair users."
yorkshire wildlife park doncaster,positive,"There is 20 disabled parking spaces available, which are a short distance from the entrance to the park. The spaces are very spacious allowing room for bigger vehicles and the use of ramps. At busy periods the disabled parking spaces are not always available however ordinary car spaces are still spacious and are readily available. The car park is of rough terrain (Gravel) making it potential difficult to push a wheelchair across however there is a path at the side of car park running to the entrance. The disabled car parking spaces were extremely wide, so the car doors were able to open to their full potential to ensure that a disabled or wheelchair user can easily get in and out of the car. There is no restricted access to the rear of the vehicle either, so that a ramp can easily be located for assistance. The spaces are located near to the entrance, with the pathway there being level.   Easy to find, sign posted well within Doncaster. traveling by car was easier as there is a long uneven path leading up to the entrance. I arrived by car and there was ample disabled parking. We had to ask where it was because otherwise we wouldn't have found it. There were 4 disabled toilets at this venue. One of these included an adult changing area and hoist. There are disabled toilets throughout the park and in the restaurants/cafes. They are well maintained and have all the relevant bars to help. However they have one single disabled toilet by the entrance which also is a baby change so you have no chance of using it. Disabled parking next to first building - park shop - so very convenient; however, doesn't have parking bays so cars can park close to each other which may make it difficult for some people to exit the car or get a wheelchair up to the car if someone has parked too close. Accessible toilets available at each toilet stop. Only issue is that in ladies toilet at the entrance, there is an additional toilet that had the accessible sign on it with a baby changing facility.  This would not be suitable for someone with mobility problems.  Although it is slightly larger than the other cubicles, the toilet is placed so near the wall that the toilet paper dispenser prevents someone sitting comfortable or having space to stand from sitting easily and there were no grab rails in here.  It was difficult to use not having mobility problems. Parking for blue badge holders is by the main entrance/shop. There is a rogue sign pointing in the wrong direction, but hold your course towards the main building, and you’ll be fine. Have your badge ready to wave at the attendants.  There are plenty of accessible loos. My preference is to avoid the one closest to the entrance due to a big, heavy door I always struggle with. Plus currently the queues for the toilets are quieter elsewhere.   The disabled car parking offers 120 spaces for blue badge holders only and were very wide so the car doors were able to open to their full potential to ensure that a disabled or wheelchair user can easily get in and out of the car. There is no restricted access to the rear of the vehicle either, so that a ramp can be easily used. The spaces are located near to the entrance, with the pathway there being level.   There are various disabled accessible toilets within the park, however there is not one at the car park meaning that you have to walk into the park first to find this. They are all level access and large, with wide doors making it easy for a wheelchair user and carer(s) to be present. In the Safari Cafe toilet, there is a hoist, which is ideal if this is required. The toilets themselves are high, which is beneficial for anybody transferring from a wheelchair to the toilet independent or with assistance.   The car park is close by to the entrance, with disabled spaces at the closest end to the entrance, with only a short walk between the car park and the entrance. There are a number of toilets around the park, with a disabled toilet to allow for additional room where required."
young vic london,negative,The accessible toilet is good. But the red emergency cord was tied up and hidden well out of reach of anyone who might fall to the floor. Not only tied up: the plastic triangle at its end had been hooked around a water pipe! This is incomprehensibly stupid. These cords should hang freely all the way to the floor so that they can be reached from the floor in an emergency. Four stars lost for this - and for the stack of spare restaurant chairs placed right in front of the accessible toilet. Which bit of 'accessible' do they not understand?
young vic london,positive,"I don't know about parking, but Southwark Station (Jubilee Line) is a few yards away and is fully step-free."
yummytori edinburgh,positive,"Plenty of parking near-by but its on a busy main road, so no car-park, but space for a vehicle to stop and get someone out.   There is a bus stop right outside with a number of different buses to catch. Great toilet, all new and shiny."
yuvraaj restaurant sunderland,positive,Restaurant has its own car park but plenty of parking on the street too. Fully accessible with all required handrails. 
yves saint laurent museum marrakech,negative,The museum is a little out of the centre of town - we got a cab. There are different types of taxis some of which are more spacious than others!
yves saint laurent museum marrakech,positive,Clean & tidy!
z arts manchester,positive,Z Arts is on a bus route. Its on a busy main road. There are disabled parking bays at the front of the building.
zaap thai street food york,negative,"Being in the centre of york, parking is very limited. There are some bus stops nearby. "
zads manchester,negative,I came on the Stage coach 86 bus which stops near by. This bus doesn't have audible or visual stop information.  There isn't a car park that I could see. 
zanfish derby,negative,"There is parking out front but there are no designated disabled bays. Several buses go near by including Spondin Flyer, i4, Indigo and Ilkeston Flyer (all Trent Barton). Road is busy but there is a pelican crossing though. "
zest cafe saint andrews,positive,"There is on-street parking right outside Zest, with no time limit and free to Blue Badge holders only. There are designated Blue Badge parking spaces nearby. Parking is   £1.10 per hour for other vehicles, with a two-hour maximum stay. There is a parking meter just 5 metres from the café entrance. Emerging from the rear of a wheelchair-accessible vehicle, care is required as access is directly onto the busy road. The nearest dropped kerb is at the nearby mini roundabout. There are moveable tables outside on the street, with a canopy for cover. The streets around the café are paved, with a slight camber.  St Andrews can be reached by the main roads A91, A917, and A915. The nearest railway station is Leuchars, 10.2 miles or 16km away, approximately 20 minutes by car or bus. Accessible taxis can be booked in advance - contact Williamsons on 01334 476787. There is a regular bus service from Dundee via Leuchars station into St Andrews, Stagecoach route no.99 has low floor access, wheelchair access and Wi-Fi.

On street parking, free of charge for any one with a blue badge.  Many spaces right at the door. Clean, spacious toilets."
zest cafe st andrews,positive,On street parking available and free for blue badge holders. Plenty of spaces in front of the cafe and in the surounding area. There is a disabled toilet in the ladies which you get to by going through two doors. The loo is clean and spacious and has rails and an accessible sink. Easy access
zitto north berwick,negative,Blue badge parking is in the main car park next to the public toilets.  Once parked you have to walk through the car park and turn left until you see the rear entrance to Zittos.  You then cross an area covered with large gravel.  Not ideal for wheelchairs.  The rear entrance is clearly marked.  This leads into the lower dining area.
zitto north berwick,positive,Large toilet.  Well appointed and clean.  You have to be pushed in and then pulled out as there is no room to maneuver.  
zizzi glasgow,negative,No specific car park as it is in the city centre. There are a number of disabled bays in near by queen street.
zizzi london,negative,We took the train and a taxi which was easy.  I don't know about parking. Couldn't see any signs and couldn't get to the toilets because it was all too tightly packed with tables
zoo berlin berlin,positive,Got there via the underground which was easy to use and pretty accessible too. Walking from the underground to the zoo was quick and easy with wide flat paths.
zoo veldhoven veldhoven,negative,No specifically separate section for disabled vehicles. Plenty of level parking available near the entrance
zsl london zoo london,negative,The nearest London Underground stations are at least 15 minutes walk away. Buses and taxis are options.
zsl london zoo london,positive,"Clean and spacious. Car parks outside, however I chose the train/cab option without a hitch. Plenty of accessible loos which were well signed. Grab handles on both sides, vertical and horizontal.  Most were spotless - great for a Saturday in half term - the one in the restaurant had been well used and was a bit grubby."
zsl whipsnade zoo dunstable,negative,"We chose to drive write up to the zoo entrance to save a walk from the free car park.  On arrival I had to choose between free car parking or a free 'carer' ... both in the region of £20.00. The staff member was friendly and helpful but no one in the kiosk was able to tell us whether the bus from the free car park was wheelchair accessible 😕. If it was, I'd have chosen that option.  I think the team there needs to know as that would help other visitors"
