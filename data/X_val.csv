0,There is a very good regular bus service with buses passing the door frequently and victoria train and tube station are in close proximity. Unsure about parking as we did not take the car.
1,"As previously mentioned access is pretty poor despite having the ramp outside it’s very small and difficult to manoeuvre around. The items are on high shelves that are difficult to read/reach from wheelchair height. The counter to pay is also very high up and with racks on the edge with more items for sale it’s very difficult to get the wheelchair close to hand over change/use the card machine. 

Tables were okay to sit at but not much room for moving around as previously stated.  "
2,"There was a small lip at the entrance door, which was narrow and didn't open fully. My wheelchair just fitted through but it was very tight. The tables had large bases so I couldn't get my chair very close - I ended up transferring to one of their chairs to get close enough to eat comfortably."
3,All are excellent and happy to help.
4,"Lots of space in the toilets for changing, and there is a changing room available with a hoist near the main entrance."
5,I saw no specific disabled parking for the hotel. We were able to always park near to the rear of the hotel.
6,pleasant enough but didn't anticipate needs and nothing special
7,"Wide aisles, generous sized lift"
8,"We went as part of a group including people with disability. The menu was not extensive or adventurous, but the prices were very reasonable and everything was very well cooked. It was a delight to find a traditional pub of character with easy access."
9,"Visited with my wife in her wheelchair. Most paths were good, though the walled garden was more difficult and the greenhouses not wheelchair accessible. We stuck to the main garden area, not going to the more park like areas, but came upon some unexpected steps (fortunately my wife has some mobility and was able to cope with the steps with my help - no rails to help.)
As another reviews has said the entrance/shop/restaurant is cramped and depends on others' cooperation to negotiate. Restaurant has lots of outside space and tables if the weather is fine. But the recommendation for lunch is to get there as early as possible (service starts at 11:45).
"
10,"An accessible cafe with very friendly and helpful staff. Seating is all on one level with a choice of high back chairs, booths or bucket seats. "
11,"Multiple disabled toilets can be found throughout the venue on both floors. The locks displays the words “vacant” or “engaged”, both on a white background, which is difficult to read even for someone with relatively good vision. I did not need the toilet during my time there so cannot say anything else."
12,"There was no vacant disabled parking area but as it is a small village, we were able to park on the quayside at the back of the hall.  There are buses to Findhorn via Forres from Inverness, apparently some are accessible but I was unable to verify this."
13,There is access via a small and overly severe ramp at the door. Once inside access to lower level only (five or six tables).  Disabled loo on the site about twenty metres away.  Food was nice though a bit pricey for what it was and small choice for veggies.
14,"The bar, café, restaurant and conference centre downstairs are accessible. There is no lift to go upstairs where they have got a small conference room and further all bedrooms, which are all only accessible by stairs."
15,Good staff. Worth a visit 
16,"We were in our own car and used disabled parking spaces with my blue badge.  These were generally easy to find, but not numerous.  We also used the ferries on the lake; these were able to take my powerchair, and had lifts to get access to all levels."
17,"Staff were excellent and made our trip!
One on one help with clear professional and very friendly attitude."
18,Good access and space in loo. Right to left side transfer.  Lost a star as there is no alarm. 
19,Very Friendly and Helpful
20,There is level entry from the front of the shop. The shop is very old and the lifts are exeptionally small but I managed in my manual wheelchair with space for one extra person. Not all the restaurant are accessible but the Parlour and the Diamond tea Room are accessible. Avoid the Gallery restaurant which requires access via staff lift - although the staff were very friendly it is a little awkward as you need to be escorted by someone. Staff in the Gallery Restaurant are NOT friendly
21,"Finding the building was not easy as a visually impaired person.

I travelled in the company of a powerchair user. I could manage the steps up to the entrance but my travelling companion couldn’t.

I understand there are two ‘accessible’ bedrooms but did not progress to see these so cannot comment further."
22,"Unfortunately, the disabled toilet is very inconveniently located for live shows. It is at the opposite side of the venue to the viewing platform, and it can be tricky getting to it when there is a crowd. However, security staff are always available to clear a path. The toilet is a reasonable size and well maintained."
23,"Amazing wheelchair accessible apartment in a lovely neighbourhood with fantastic public transport links into the centre. There is a range of apartments to choose from such as 1, 2 or 3 bedrooms with en-suite bathroom, kitchen and living area. There is also 24-hour care service if required, adapted gym, physiotherapist, hydrotherapy pool, a range of equipment (such as hoists) and a lovely restaurant. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Loved our stay there!"
24,Yes there was a disabled toilet and it was a reasonably large size but the thing that really surprised me is that there was only one vertical rail that was on the wall behind the toilet cistern. There were plenty of horizontal rails and a drop down rail to enable side access but I require vertical rails and there wasn't one that I could use!
25,"Step free access.
We were in a room on 2nd floor, lift available.  The room was not particularly close to the lift, and the distance could be a problem for someone relying on a rollator or sticks only.  I was in a wheelchair, with able bodied husband, so not a problem.  There was one set of fire-doors in the corridor, which were normally open, but on one occasion closed - needed an able bodied person to open the door.
The room was large enough to easily get around in a wide wheelchair.  Bathroom fully accessible, with seat in shower, and grab-rails"
26,Every thing is easily accessed on ground floor
27,"This is a very smart restaurant in Ballyhackamore, the lunch deal was pretty cheap and tasty."
28,Only had a problem once accessing the building - an ice-cream van was parked across the ramp to entrance. Politely asked to move van - no problem!
29,Can access in a wheelchair. 
30,On our visit Gallery and Academy staff were very helpful
31,"The Chalet tearoom / restaurant is wheelchair accessible, with a large wheelchair accessible toilet, friendly staff and a lovely atmosphere.

Personally I go here for the cakes (they are delicious!) but all of their food comes highly recommended.  There are large wooden tables and chairs inside, and some seating outside.  The outside seating area is less accessible, but there is plenty of room inside and no problem to have a chair moved if required to allow wheelchair space.

This tearoom is very popular so can get busy, particularly during peak times, so if you want to go for lunch then I would suggest going before or after peak lunchtime periods (or phone in advance).

Parking is on-street and can be busy and congested.  Options are to park a bit further away or to travel from Keswick which takes around 20 minutes on a mobility scooter via the traffic-free Keswick to Portinscale path (see photo)."
32,"Access to the Staion is by lift at the west end and ramp at the east entrances, at the moment the whole area of the St. James Centre area is being redeveloped so the James Craig walk is closed. Well serviced by tram and bus services."
33,"We are not disabled, but found the parking more than satisfactory."
34,"When I phoned in advance to discuss my health related requirements and when I checked in the staff were very helpful and friendly and I felt reassured. However, once we were in our room the help was lacking. One example-I needed to wash medical equipment and lost my washing up liquid, there was no where to buy any and the hotel refused to help with this!"
35,"very unhelpful staff in visitor centre, there was nothing to see there anyway, 30 mins are car parking but it too 10 minutes to get wheelchair out of car, & 10 mins to put it back then 2 mins to get to visitor centre. If you stay over 30 mins then minimum charge is 6.30 e for 2 hours"
36,The hotel is half way along the Royal Mile and a prime spot for exploring the city. It has three accessible bedrooms.
37,I came by public transport was easy to get from bus stop to atik. 
38,"Easy, level access from the pavement into the store as a wheelchair user. Once inside there are tablet style terminals where you can look up what you want to buy and make your purchase. A different approach to the usual Argos. The tablet style terminals were accessible from my wheelchair but may be a little high for some people. Didn't spot a lowered more accessible one but there may well be one.

The collection points are accessible for wheelchair users."
39,"China Exchange is a Chinese cultural exchange charity which hosts a variety of events which are open to the general public.  They offer a regular programme of talks, music and other events. Their Prudential series features talks + Q+A with famous guests from film stars, musicians, business people, etc. Events are reasonably priced, especially if you manage to book early and get on of their early bird tickets. Past speakers have included Princess Eugenie, Tom Jones, Goldie Hawn, Michael Caine, Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber, Stephen Fry, Michael Parkinson, Jude Law and Tracey Emin. "
40,For a gardens built on some pretty uneven ground the access was good.
41,The staff were all amazing and super helpful. They were always more than happy to help and very friendly. The kitchen staff were also very accommodating and happy to make meals for my dietary requirements. I couldn't fault the service at all. 
42,"Clean and tidy, fully accessible, roomy loo. Easy to find not far from entrance."
43,"It’s sad to report on my most recent visit the staff were verging on discriminating. They offered husband accompanying me my wine, not once but twice. They even went as far as to address him when asking what I wanted to order.  Some members of the staff were better than others. Overall though I found them unfriendly and caring."
44,"There is one accessible toilet upstairs and the standard toilets are downstairs - this is the reason for the low star rating. I've been to this restaurant many times now and consider it a family favourite of mine, but I feel the accessible toilet should have a RADAR key as it appears to be abused by people not necessarily needing to use it as it may not be very clear the standard toilets are downstairs. I've found myself having to wait for quite a while, while others are using it. 

The toilet itself is a good size with space for turning. There are grab bars on each side of the toilet and beside the sink. The emergency cord is also next to the toilet and I've hung my Euan's Guide red cord card each time I visit as it seems to be removed. There is a big mirror on the wall too which is at a good height for wheelchair users - it gives an almost full-length view - yay!
"
45,There was an accessible toilet in the entrance area. Modern and large enough to accommodate a sizeable powerchair.
46,"Victoria Station is very nearby. If you're arriving at Victoria by train, you're likely to get ramp assistance (though it's very hit-and-miss at this station). Many buses will drop you off here. The tube is completely un-accessible - a disgrace for such a major London transport hub."
47,"Good.
Car park is flat with few disabled spaces. Ground floor easily negotiated. Lift to dining room on first floor."
48,Excellent you can park outside your Lodge
49,Level access into the building and a gradual ramp up to my table.
50,"We went to London to see the show HAMILTON at the Victoria Palace theatre. A member of staff took us along a side street pathway (which was a little bumpy) to the wheelchair accessible entrance to the theatre. Once inside he pointed out a disabled toilet that I could use. We were then taken to the ground floor box. The box was at the back of the stalls and had a slightly elevated straight on view of the stage. The view was classed as restricted (couldn’t see the top area of the stage) but there was very little impact on the overall viewing of the show. There were 4 removable chairs in the box. 1 chair was removed so that my wheelchair could slot into the space. My family sat in the remaining 3 chairs. There was another member of staff who brought us drinks and sweets that we requested. There was also a list of merchandise that was available to buy. After the show finished we were asked to hang back for a short amount of time so that we didn’t get caught up in the crowd.
It was a really enjoyable evening that I would recommend especially if you have an interest in hip hop/rap music combined with American history and politics.😀"
51,the staff done what had to be done
52,"It’s all on the level to enter Spa, and no steps to be seen inside. As it’s a small Spa then you can see and use all the facilities here."
53,"Even seasoned festival-goers couldn't understand why the condition of toilets at this festival was so bad by day one! We managed to find a permanent public toilet beside the local cafe which was usable, and there was a disabled loo there. It was being used by everyone by the looks of it though. I did not see signage for any other accessible toilets - although they will have been there."
54,"The museum was very accessible for wheelchair users, given that the exhibits are trains.  

The Train Ambulance exhibition was fantastic, we used a wheelchair (borrowed form the Museum) for the visit and were able to get up onto the 'platform' using the exhibits lift.   On display was also a Rocket from Japan, again the Museum had built a ramp to allow wheelchair access and the entrance to the train was wide enough to take the wheelchair onto it.  The display stands are also well designed, as the wheelchair was able to tuck under it, enabling the user to get close to the sign.  We also booked in for Afternoon Tea on the Countess of York and that too was accessible with a lift and a ramp onto the carriage.  Staff were very attentive and helpful.  All in all a fabulous day out."
55,"The Royal Mail Delivery office is located not far from the town centre area. This is also the collection point for items that they have been unable to deliver to you.
There is good general access from the town centre to the office it is part of a small industrial estate."
56,Entry to the visitors' centre is flat from the disabled car park and there is an electric door opener. There is a clear way through the visitors centre and an all weather route round the reserve. All bird hides are easily accessible in a scooter and there are also handrails.
57,"All toilets were accessible, no alarm cords."
58,Not sure on the parking but if you left Queen Street station via the George  Square exit as you come down the ramp there is a push pad door in your left which takes into the hotel. Best place to stay if you want to be In the city centre and are taking. The train. Taxis could also pick up and drop off right outside this door.
59,"The staff here are respectful, helpful and well trained in Disability Awareness - from greeting and exhibition to the cafe and gift shop I was made to feel welcome, and all questions were answered politely and enthusiastically. "
60,Good access with good across field tracks suitable for motorised or manual (with help) all down hill to the poppies so obvious a steady climb back to the car park - but worth it
61,"Nido Student accommodation offers a positive outlook on the accommodation of disabilities in public buildings.  Staff are very aware of access issues and are on hand at any given moment to assist residents and visitors in a friendly and polite manner. In addition, every area of the building is equipped accordingly to the needs of people with disabilities, ensuring that no one faces barriers while going about with their occupations around the premises. Overall the building is available to everyone and is constructed in a manner that makes it wheelchair available.  "
62,"In town so very good for public transport, and I believe there are disabled parking spaces near to the museum."
63,"Access in and around the park was good. We followed the various paths and explored around the lakes, gardens and activity areas. The Visitor Centre in the middle of the park was accessible. Finding you way was easy as there are loads of signs and a very good map that you can download from the website."
64,"Easily accessible, friendly staff. "
65,Parking is available on site by arrangement. The Theatre complex is close to Waterloo Station which offers a range of connections and there are plenty of local buses and taxis.
66,"Staff were friendly but a little too much. I was rushed into the lift and had to ask them to leave me to wander the area taking up the atmosphere. Similarly I was bundled to the front of the line to wait to go inside the wine bar area when I'd actually wanted coffee, then I just had to wait in line, which was awkward."
67,Always friendly and helpful and will give you directions on the best route via ramp and lifts to the exhibits or exhibitions you wish to visit.
68,"The staff at Morecambe FC were very welcoming on arrival, The staff would help you find anything if at all you don't know were something is."
69,"The venue is a couple of miles from the town centre where the River Ness meets the Moray Firth, therefore you would need your car or take a taxi to visit if in a wheelchair, otherwise it is a long walk. They do have a minibus service though if you don't need a wheelchair. The ticket office is very roomy and accessible, as are the adjoining cafe and toilets. Everything is flat and spacious and I found no problems when I got there. 

I was really impressed by the smooth and manageable ramp leading down to the boat and once  on board I was really pleased to see how much room there was; I could turn very easily and was able to have a 360 degree view.  If the boat was really busy, this might have been a bit more difficult.  I had the choice of sitting both outside on deck or inside and both had amazing views!"
70,Sheildaig is a small village in the Scottish Highlands so only accessible by car. Nanny's is a cafe right on the waterfront and there is parking right outside. There's no dedicated blue badge parking as such but you should be able to park close by.
71,"Nice wide doors, step free entry, large accessible toilet. We went at lunchtime and had a large sandwich on freshly made bread and a freshly made pizza with a soft drink thrown in for a fiver each. They serve alcoholic drinks and are open in the evening too. Had a nice courtyard outside for the summer, but I couldn't see how you would get to it in a wheelchair (and forgot to ask!)."
72,"Wheelchair accessible shops and restaurants, plenty of blue badge parking"
73,"Spacious venue with plenty of lifts between the levels and wings (north , South , East and West ). Parking is available on site and Disabled registered cars have discounts for congestion charge"
74,"Manageress ( from another restaurant apparently) was exceptional very friendly and excellent customer service skills, even though food was delayed"
75,"Every therapist at Cora gives you personal treatment according to your needs & based on your physicians orders. They are all caring & strive for great results too! I have had the pleasure of utilizing Janeal, Lisa, Amber, Inez, Eddie, Kevin, Christine, Nicholas, Javier & Foirella & Monica. They are all professional & caring individuals who only want the best for you while in their care & strive to succeed too! They have all made a huge difference in my lifestyle since my left hip replacement & I am so thankful they patiently worked with me. KUDOS to the Cora Staff!! They rock!👍👍👍"
76,The car park is always very busy and unfortunately at the first hint of rain the disabled bays are flooded to quite a depth. (See photo). A bus goes to the retail park across the other side of the dual carriageway but it is still quite a walk to go through the subway.
77,"Several (about 12, I think) disabled car park spaces."
78,"Parking was good and in a disabled space and the wheel (I was pushed) fine but then came the cobbles, everywhere except on the grass, by the time the day was done my brain was scrambled and my stomach was well mixed.  What did you expect from a medieval castle I hear you cry, well nowhere had I read that in the reviews.  Firstly we watched a demonstration of medieval swordsmanship which was surprisingly good as I heard nothing.  It was also outside and cold.  

To warm up a bit the castle was next.  To get inside I was lifted (in the chair) over a couple of steps, by 3 or 4 people and viewed the ground floor easily.  Getting to the first floor was the fun bit, there was a lift as used by the Queen but it after 2 large steps and no way could my chair be lifted here.  Nothing else for it but to get out and make it to the lift as best I could.  The lift was a tight squeeze for me and my brother (the Duke of Edinburgh must of used the stairs) and there was another chair waiting for me there.  This floor was then viewed without further incident and we went down in the same manner.

As some of Harry Potter was filmed here there was a 'witch' giving 'broomstick flying
After the castle a round of crazy golf was called for, no not me I went for coffee and a scone in the cafe.  There was a treehouse cafe too, which had a suitable walkway for wheelchairs so I had to try it out.

Had a good walk around the water gardens, which were thankfully cobble free, the wheelchair went everywhere, but it wasn't quick enough to avoid the splashes.  It was a great, full day(less the cobbles)."
79,"The best bits of the Alhambra were: 
1- The spectacular views of Granada and the surrounding area. You can see all of the historic buildings and the mountainous landscape in every direction from this high point. 
2- Nasrid Palace. The beautiful mosaic and carved tiles, mouldings, and ceilings were the highlight for me. Ive never seen so much detail and variety. 
3- The tranquility of the Generalife garden with their trees, herbs and wildflowers. 
4- I also had a good ham and cheese sandwich and a Colacao (like hot chocolate) at the cafe on Plaza de los Aljibes de la Alambra. 

The worst bits were: 
1- Driving over the cobble stones and dirt ground on the mobility scooter. It was a rough ride in lots of places. 
2- The crowds later in the day made moving around while keeping sufficient distance for Covid difficult and stressful. The earlier you get there the better for both temperature and crowds. They were controlling the flow of people through the Nasrid Palace so it wasn’t stressful in there. 
3- The frustrating lack of access where there could be ramps or covered cobbles."
80,From the city centre you can followl the riverside paths west towards some islands in the River Ness. There are various bridges that inter connect these with both sides of the River. All the paths are wide and flat apart from a short section of regular pavement. Though only a short walk from the city it feels like being in the countryside. Could also link it with a trip to the Eden Theatre /cinema and the Aquadome swimming pool. 
81,There aren't any.  But many in the local town. 
82,Usually okay depending on road works and parking spaces
83,"Gliding volunteers are made up 
1 volunteer pilot and 3 volunteer helpers who are on duty every Friday to assist with everything .
Everyone makes you very welcome, including staff in clubhouse and cafe.
"
84,"Very helpful staff, most obliging... Happy to show us other areas of the hotel / restaurant that we were interested in. And very smiley!"
85,"Darwin Brasserie is on 36th Floor at the Sky Garden overlooking the River Thames. The tables are small and space is a little cramped for a wheelchair user but it is a fun experience and the staff are friendly. It is busy but we had a table for lunch at 2.30pm when the restaurant was much quieter and we were also able to sit at a table with a better view. The Sky Garden is an accessible garden set over 3 floor at the top of the 20 Fenchurch Street and offers 360 degree uninterrupted views across the City of London. It is free for visitors to view the gardens as long as you book an entry ticket on line in advance, although if you book a table at one of the restaurants you do not need to book an entry ticket. Darwin Brasserie overlooks the gardens on floor 35 and the 360 degree external viewing platform. As part of your visit to the restaurant you should make time to look around floor 35 and go outside but make sure you have a coat as it is very cold both inside and outside on the main viewing floor. Darwin Brasserie itself is enclosed and is therefore warm."
86,"The Farm has plenty of parking with wide spaces, close to the entrance which are suitable for disable visitors."
87,"The toilet in the bathroom has one shaky grab rail, but it was not possible for me to get in/out of the bathroom without assistance - no space to manoeuvre , and steep narrow ramps to get to the bathroom

public toilet in  the basement accessed by lift.  Plenty of space, grab rails etc."
88,Car park at rear is muddy and gravely (not great for wheelchairs). Plenty on-street parking available immediately outside.
89,"There are 3 disabled parking spaces right beside the front entrance to the hotel, although this sometimes isn’t enough. At the conference that I was attending here, there were more than 3 people who require disabled spaces and needed to park further away whilst also having to use up 2 standard parking spaces.

I am not from Stirling so don’t know about the public transport, but I did notice there was a bus stop nearby and the train station is a 10-minute drive away."
90,"The CodeBase staff are super friendly, as are all the other people I've met who've been working here!"
91,"There is no dedicated car parking at the Museum. The nearest public car park is the Q Park on Durham Road.

There are three disabled parking spaces directly adjacent the museum at the top of Mushroom Lane and a further three disabled parking spaces available toward the bottom of Mushroom Lane near the tennis courts (access to the museum from these is through the park). 

Blue badge holders can use Pay & Display bays on Mushroom Lane, (near the Dam House entrance) and Damer Street  without the need to pay .  "
92,The stadium is 5 minutes off the M9 motorway and very easy to find. With plenty parking and very good level access into the stadium it is one of the better grounds not in the top division of Scottish football that is worth a visit!!
93,As with everything there it was a decent size and to a very high standard and needless to say clean and tidy.
94,"Either park on main road with blue badge or, if no room, go to Scottish Office park behind restaurant."
95,Perfectly adequate. 
96,Sarah is helpful and there if you need to know anything.
97,We used the stairs their was not that many but their is a lift you can use also if needs be 
98,No disabled loo. All loos are downstairs so of no use to wheelchair users.
99,"Third time at this festival.  The organisers have put a lot of thought  into making it accessible and are very helpful through the booking process (free carer ticket available if you'd be unable to go without assistance). The viewing platform for the main stage is a reasonable size but the one by the other stage is tiny.  Large screens either side of the main stage, so if you prefer to stay amongst the crowd you can still see the bands.  They could do with screens on the other stage too, as the crowds all tend to stand up when the bands get going so you get a good view of the back of peoples heads!  Previously driven to the festival and blue badge holders are provided with special parking area.  However, this year we got dropped off by taxi and the 'parking police' were not  overly helpful when the driver asked if he could drop us off closer as he had a wheelchair user in the car.
Disabled port-a-cabin toilets were provided by each stage, although I am finding these increasingly hard to use.  Also had the problem of everyone else using them as there was a distinct lack of 'normal' toilets available and  continuously ridiculous queues all day."
100,"There is an accessible toilet in the station - it is the only toilet in the station, so can be used by anyone, but only at station staffs discretion.

It is not that obvious where the toilet
 is - if coming from the East Princes St entrance, it is along the wall at the opposite side of the station.
The toilet is locked (not by a radar key) and you must ask a member of staff to let you use it.
When I asked, they checked I had a train ticket and that I was travelling, before letting me use it. 

You go through one door from the station platforms, there is a small (unused) room, before another door into the toilet. These are standard doors, not automatic or push button, but have a support-type handle on the back. They are quite wide doors, so I think most people in wheelchairs would get through without difficulty.

The toilet is a large space, plenty of room for a carer if you needed one. 
The facilities were clean. 

There was a red cord but it didn't reach anywhere near the floor.

When you are finished you are to tell the member, so they can lock the door again. "
101,Step free wide entrance
102,"Unless you were in an organised tour, most staff were pretty indifferent but most were helpful and spoke English."
103,The Fountains Learning Centre caters access for all disabled students but the staff also makes it possible to access all areas of the library.  And to top it off the learning centre also employs disabled staff which makes life as a student a little more comfortable!
104,"When I was at eat (Leuchie respite centre)I went to The Puffin Restaurant in North Berwick, my carer went inside and emerged with two staff who assisted us to our table and were on hand in case we needed help. they were brilliant during my visit and were brilliant at engaging with me and not asking my carer what I would like. the menu offered a great choice as did the specials sheet. the food arrived sharpish and was great value for money and tasted great. I left room for a Pub and was very impressed with how beautifully clean the restaurant was considering how busy they were the staff delivered everyone with a friendly efficient and speedy service. my carer checked out both the Ladies and found them to be clean, fresh and tidy, she also said the disabled toilet was spacious enough even for my Electric chair if required. a lovely atmosphere meant that we had a great day out, Thanks to all at the Puffin. Also thank for supporting Leuchie by taking a collection tin for us."
105,"There are two on-site accessible toilets available for all visitors to use that are accessed by a platformed ramp. The toilets are like porta-cabins but, very spacious. Any sized wheelchair would fit and you would be able to have numerous people assisting you. Although even though it's very spacious, the toilet is tightly located in the left-hand side of the room so wheelchair users would only be able to transfer at the right-hand side.

Unfortunately, there isn’t a Changing Places toilet on-site and I’m not sure where the nearest one is."
106,Might be a bit small for large wheelchair. Fine for my light one.
107,"Café was wheelchair friendly though the desk where you placed your order and where you paid wasn't at a lower level for wheelchair users.
I could navigate my wheelchair around in the café okay - In some areas of the café the tables and chairs are quite close together but in other parts there is room to manoeuvre around.
In the shop part of the garden centre (we didn't go into the pants section) the aisles and displays are very crammed together and it was very difficult for my carer to manoeuvre my wheelchair around and there where some part of the stair that where too inaccessible even for my narrow wheelchair."
108,"The main entrance has six steps from the gift shop into the museum so access is via the large hanger door next to the entrance. Once inside, there is plenty of space to see vehicles in the hangers and look into the shop window displays. Some side rooms are either very tight on turning space or you have to enter forwards and go out backwards. One small area was up stairs. The cafe was up some stairs (see photo). There is one table at the bottom of the stairs and staff brought a menu and described the food available. I could see most exhibits and shop windows from a low height and the floor is smooth and flat. There are buttons to activate an audio description of some shops/history.  Outside is a picnic table with wheelchair access. There are no rope barriers between motor vehicles."
109,There are so many animals to see and there are lots of activities for younger children. It is a fair price and  the food is great. Me and my family will definitely be going again during the summer holidays.
110,You have to pay for the parking. Details are on their web page.
111,There is disabled parking at the front of the venue.
112,"A nature reserve with many species of birds just off the m6 motorway with great accessible paths and tracks take you round and about the lake that has a totally level access floating village with cafe, shops, information centre and a large accessible toilet everywhere has good wide doors. There are accessible viewing rooms around the lake where you can sit and watch all the different wildlife. Only assistance dogs are allowed in the nature reserve and floating village. There is also an adventure play area for the kids."
113,"Disabled access kinda depends on your ability.  It is partially off road, with the right equipment it would be no problem e.g. electric wheelchair."
114,Plenty of parking and well signposted from the road. Not sure about the public transport options.
115,"There was an accessible toilet at the entrance and near the cafe, although they didn't have an emergency cord. There was a sign suggesting ""personal care facilities including a hoist"" was available at reception. "
116,"A little tight and must be able to transfer. Support rails and shower stool.
Toilet flush on pedal.
Remember, this is a boat, carrying it's own water supply so ""ship shower"" so you don't run out!"
117,"Very good at the hub,"
118,"Automatic doors, all on the flat. Very large store, with no seating for a rest if using walking aids.
There are accessible toilets on the premises, but no signage reflecting this, otherwise signage good."
119,There was a lot of disabled parking spaces but we decided to go around the back of the beefeater and park beside the premier inn hotel and enter via the premier inn and enter via the back of the beefeater. Excellent car parking. 
120,Came by car. Easy parking in blue badge space on tarmac close to entrance.
121,"Friendly staff.  majority will do anything to help you.  the kitchen is a training cafe, so a high level of disablity awareness."
122,Great day at Homelands. The Paxton Centre had talks on #Accessible Fife and Fatigue Management. There were therapy tasters and a mindfulness session. The welly boot garden now has a few colourful additions from the 'Paint a Welly' workshop. The cafe served delicious home baking and tgere was a consultation on what people would like to see on offer in the Paxton Centre in 2016. Ideas ranged from yoga to conversational German to a bridge group.
123,"As explained in part one review, it’s handy as near to hotels entrance, but difficult to then get in via the ramp, as told in part one, so please read that as it shows you how to get in."
124,"Bathroom only had one handle beside the toilet. Shower was very high up, had shower doors that ended two feet from the floor and no grab handles, but had a bath weirdly enough. It was nearly impossible to get about the bathroom in my chair."
125,"Following a fairly recent renovation the provision for disabled people is excellent. Obviously parking in the centre of Newcastle is an issue but there are some disabled bay nearby. Once in the building the facilities are excellent. There is a lift to every floor, screen and cafe. There are numerous disabled toilets throughout the building. Wheelchair users and their partners are allocated seats/spaces at the back of the circle in the Classic Screen which makes the view excellent. In the other screens the seating is at the front which is not so good, but OK"
126,Most of the 'exciting stuff' takes place in the car - eg when you're driving in the lion enclosure! At the areas where you get out to explore most of the structures have ramps into or onto viewing areas. A notable exception is the boat trip to the chimps and some of the activities such as the Flying Fox zip wire. There is also good signage throughout and 'talking telescopes' but we didn't try those.
127,Super friendly and helpful
128,"All staff and volunteers are very helpful and friendly. They are currently working on improvements for visitors with visual impairments and visitors who are neuro-diverse. Museum staff were very open to anything that would make for a better visit. On our visit, shop staff were happy to discuss any changes and move things around to make things easier for us. "
129,"Staff were sympathetic, and helped me to get OUT of the shop (I had got stuck between some display units) but I didn't feel they really understood why such a tightly-packed shop, inaccessible to wheelchair users, is (1) discriminatory (2) bad for business. "
130,"This is a good pub serving interesting food out in the countryside near to Kirkham Abbey (English Heritage). Its major weakness is that apart from a ramp into the pub foyer, there are absolutely no disability friendly facilities - no accessible toilet, the main part of the pub is accessed via stairs, no  Blue Badge Parking Bay and the Baby Changing Facilities are in the Ladies Toilets only. The staff were very friendly but made no attempt to assist us to solve the issues. Their WebSite does not make mention of these issues. I am prepared to reluctantly accept that there may be structural / design issues making them difficult to solve but customers should be warned before they come."
131,They were brilliant they let us look around the day before our visit as we were concerned about access they also looked after my assistant dog while I swam and found my helpers swimming costume  which she accidentally left behind
132,We didn't see any designated disabled parking spaces however there was plenty of space in the hotel car park. Needed to cross the gravel car park before reaching the patio.
133,"Services have disabled parking spaces around entrance. However it is hard to tell which are disabled and which are parent and child. There is level entrance to Greggs which is outside of the main services and into the main entrance. There are a few steps for entry which you go in. There is a rail and a wheelchair mini-lift/stair lift. The toilets involve a long walk around the services so you go past all the shops and restaurants. However there is a ""secret"" door to the right as you get to the top of the stairs. This opens up to the corridor where the toilets are. The M&S is only at Westbound services. There is a footbridge to this or if you ring a number displayed at the disabled parking spaces you can drive there via an access road."
134,"Costa Coffee does not have a car park but, there is on street parking and a couple of council car parks that allow free parking for customers with a disabled blue badge.

There are buses that go all over the Dundee and Angus and a train station beside the main street but, I’m not sure how often the train stops in Broughty Ferry."
135,"Rancho Grande is a sea front restaurant, serving a wide variety of food. It also offers take away cakes and there is also a small shop area selling food such as biscuits, etc which would make nice gifts. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. The ground floor is step free."
136,Staff very helpful and friendly.
137,"Staff were welcoming and friendly. Food was ordered at the counter, and then the food and drink were brought to your table."
138,"There were lots of volunteers each very friendly and helpful. Good organisation to greet, register and kit out with safety gear and then onto boats."
139,"The hotel has its own small car park plus ample car parking in the nearby streets and Railway Station, 2 mins from the Hotel, there is a 30 min butservice from Edinburgh, with a concession bus pass this makes all the difference and can help make it a real adventure, there other services from Berwick, Haddington, North Berwick as well as Edinburgh. The bus stops are outside the Hotel on either side of the street east and west bound."
140,Downstairs accessible bathroom but lock is sometimes broken
141,"A delightful cafe situated in a stupendous spot
The food and service is always good
I think I must visit it about 5 times a year - am going again next month"
142,"The door is a little heavy at the front entrance, once inside the cafe is flat throughout. The only other potential issue is that some of the tables are a bit close together. Overall very good though."
143,"Very easy to park. Long wide ramp to access terrace. Flat entrance and spacious interior. Good food and drinks. Friendly and helpful staff. When I was unable to have some items on a large breakfast they told me it would be cheaper to change the options on a kids breakfast, thus saving money on the same items."
144,"A lovely hotel with good disabled access, level and spacious with good sized lifts. I found the doors to the room a bit on the heavy side to open. 
My room turned out not to be an accessible one, but I managed with the wheelchair. This was due to me travelling with a team and other players got the wheelchair rooms and said they were great. Good amount of grab rails and wet room shower. I apologise in advance as I never got photos of the accessible rooms, I only took photos of my room."
145,"It was fabulous to be part of the audience for the BBC Radio Scotland young Traditional Musician of the year 2019!  The show featured six phenomenal finalists in this traditional Scottish music competition. 

The Glasgow City Halls is a great venue with lots of traditional character to the building. It is situated within the Merchant City area of Glasgow. For Wheelchair users this is quite a pleasant area to navigate as there are quite a few dropped kerbs and pedestrian areas.

The venue itself has quite a few heavy manual doors which I found only manageable. I am not sure if I approached the venue from the wrong side but found myself having to do a complete circle of the outside of the building to find the accessibile entrance. There is a multi storey car park on the same street as the city halls , however this may be difficult for vehicles with a high roof. 

There is also an open air car park on one not too far from the Halls. This is quite rough ground with pot holes at a cost of 6 pounds for 12 hours this may be cheaper than elsewhere."
146,"There is a hotel car park with barrier entry and exit and several disabled parking spaces at the back of the hotel right near the hotel entrance doors.
I cannot comment on public transport as I arrived by car
The hotel is on a hill so it is a bit of a push in a manual chair to get down to the riverside"
147,"Generally disabled access in the area was easy, plenty of ramps onto pavements and good access to most buildings.  Restaurants were very accommodating and made space for my powerchair at tables when needed."
148,"It's through a heavy door, which is a fire door so there's a reason! The door swung out which helps when getting in and out but is always tricky to then close to use the toilet. Other than that it was well sized, clean and stocked. "
149,"Super friendly, I'm deducting half a star as they were clueless as to their allergy menu."
150, Both receptionists were helpful carrying our baggage and advising us where to visit and the restaurant staff also seemed fine. 
151,It may not be in the centre of town but the access is great. It doesn't have a ceiling hoist but the access for a powerchair user is great in every other way.
152,"There are two accessible loos, one of them downstairs and the other one in the second floor of the museum, both of them are easy to access through the lift and easy to find due to the clear signs.
The loos are big enough and very clean and tidy."
153,Ground floor has no steps Cafe is easily accessible with a lift to the first floor of the Museum.
154,"Dawlish is a small resort and the main town centre by the seafront is flat. All the town's main tourist attractions are a couple of minutes, level walk from the train station, apart for Dawlish Museum (see seperate review) which is on a hill. Opposite the railway station is the safari mini golf (see my seperate review). There is a brook that runs through the centre of the town, which is home to the famous Black Swans and other waterfowl. Next to the brook is a large lawn, trees, flowers and shrubs. There is plenty of seating and it is a popular place to relax. In this area there is a tourist information office, which is step free (if I remember correctly) and there are toilets including a public, accessible toilet which requires a radar key.
On one side of the brook is Brunswick Place and on the other The Strand. These two roads are the main shopping streets in Dawlish. There is a good selection of cafes, tea rooms and pubs in Dawlish. There are also a few gift shops and an indoor amusement arcade. There is also a co-op supermarket, bank and chemist. On Brunswick Place there is Dawlish Waterfowl Centre and the Shaftesbury Theatre, which I didn't visit during my stay. Continuing along following the brook you come to Manor Gardens, a waterside park with benches and a children's play area.
There are lovely sea views and also a sea wall walk (see my seperate reviews).

"
155,There is some disabled parking available at the harbour.
156,Can't comment on the parking. The Metro system is fully accessible and the gallery is about five minutes on foot (and on the the level) from Monument Station. Local buses all have manually operated ramps and the drivers we encountered were very helpful.
157,2 spaces outside the lodge dedicated to the property
158,Staff were pleasant and helpful. I didn't need anything but I'm sure they would have obliged.
159,"Easy to find with space to manouvre/include a carer, but not super clean."
160,Great disabled toilet (see photo). It’s  spacious and has an emergency red Cord. There is a sink and a mirror which are both at a suitable height for wheelchair users. There is also a baby changing unit.
161,"An excellent upper end Indian restaurant with good access.  At the old Dore Station in west Sheffield with a number of disabled parking spaces immediately outside the restaurant. Easy ramp access into a wide opening door (admittedly with another straight after) with staff very quick to open them for us.  Tables well spaced so easy to get to a convenient table. Excellent toilet, very spacious and no highchairs or similar stored in there preventing an easy transfer onto the toilet.  Oh, and really nice food, lots of fish and seafood, many different dishes as well as some standard curries."
162,"This year due to covid19, there are not so many accessible public toilets in Javea. However at the El Arenal beach  most restaurants have access to a disabled access toilet."
163,Plenty of space in wet room for wheelchair or showerchair and carer
164,"The staff are very helpful and friendly , they always ensure that you are alright and assistance can be requested."
165,"I didn't use the primary accessible loo, but I was impressed to see in the ladies that one of the cubicles has been converted to be more accessible - it has grab rails inside and the door opens outwards instead of inwards. It would be a tight squeeze to fit a second person inside though, and there's no indication outside that these facilities are there, which is a shame!"
166,"On street parking was available, but no disabled parking was spotted near the venue."
167,Pathway pretty smooth - see photos.
168,"There is a ramp from Festival Square up to the front door. Once inside plenty of room to manoeuvre. However, the disabled loo is downstairs so you must take a lift."
169,Staff are very helpful but they are limited but the information booth is always manned if you need help.
170,"Access onto the station is good, also into the shop and cafe are all on one level. There is a ramp onto the train with a member of staff to assist. The only problem is the 10 minute walk to the museum. The start of the path at the station end is pretty uneven  with stones. It is a cinder path thereafter and pretty flat but prone to puddles in wet weather. "
171,Usually ok but not usually had to ask for help during my visit.
172,I was not able to get into this shop. Zero stars.
173,"Gentle slope to front door and totally level access throughout Though the front doors are heavy and might require bit of assistance. There is plenty of room between the tables to easily reach selected table. Large illustrated menu plus more fiddley paper ones to order using pencil, but waiter happily did this for us."
174,"Good level access to get into the garden centre as the cafe is situated within. The entrance is flat with no steps which is ideal for a wheelchair user or somebody using sticks or with a rollator. The doorway into the cafe is opened manually but with no steps into it, the door is wide enough for wheelchair access."
175,"I decided to stay overnight in Glasgow following the Euan’s Guide Ambassadors event meet and review of both Glasgow Winter Markets. This Hotel was popular and often full, mentioned on Booking.com. As a budget Hotel with basic services and a price to match, could not fault it. It was exactly as described on the Hotel website and by uk standards a 2* Facility. The entrance foyer was ample in terms of space, stair cases to 7 floors and 2 lifts occupancy for 4 - 6 people ample space for wheelchair space and access. There was no car parking facility, but travelling by train or bus was only 40 m away. I was informed by someone who had stayed there last year, the breakfasts were buffet style, limited choice but plenty and it certainly was.
The room I had was large and spacious, comfortable and well provisioned, each floor was fully accessible."
176,A great accessible hotel with great views.
177,Could not have been improved.
178,"My daughter had a great day out at Bolton Abbey Skipton.
The access to the Abbey was brilliant. We could park directly next to it - not on the official car parks. The area around the Abbey was fine, we did not have too many problems with the electric chair on the grass although the walking paths leading further away were too steep for us. But close to Bolton Abbey we were really content to wonder and laze in the sunshine by the river"
179,"Parking is very difficult in Glasgows west end but my father has a blue badge and found a accessible parking spot just around the corner.
I traveled by bus from the city center, Dumbarton Road is very well servred bus route."
180,Given the vessel is floating the access can be difficult at times according to the level of tide. There are two access ramps to board and embark. These can at times be set at a very steep angle and may make it difficult to get aboard. Once on board access was very good and a lift will take you to the various levels of the ship.
181,"The accessible bathroom was large but it was a"" bath tub not a roll in shower. The grab rails have been put in a very strange position. The horizontal ones are fairly normal but the vertical ones, one is on the wall behind the toilet and the other one is on the far wall facing the toilet i.e. nowhere near the toilet itself!
Also, there is no rail on the door to help you close it."
182,"Located 45 minutes North of Amsterdam, and 8 km from the nearest beach is a beautiful mix of a relaxing country setting and all the conveniences of a big city. This city is proud of its Westfriese heritage which can be experienced Every Thursday between July and Mid-September at the Westfriese folk festival.   During the summer months, there is always something going on.  From the weekly Thursday market , music concerts and festivals,  chariot horse races, art fairs, and even a fish market.  This city can be accessed by train and by transit buses.  There are also taxi companies who can accommodate all needs."
183,"This is a very large 24 hour Tesco inside Falkirk's central retail park. Access overall is good, and the supermarket is close to public transport and plenty of accessible parking spaces."
184,Access was by ramps making everything easy to access. 
185,"Took my wife in her wheelchair and accessed the bar area via the in-house microbrewery accompanied by the bar tender. Disabled toilet also easily accessed.
A brilliant bar with excellent cask ales brewed on site.
Dog and family friendly.
Highly recommended"
186,"Slight ramps, no steps I saw. A floor I'd love to take everywhere to push on, quick with loads of grip. Good signage. Low level bar was excellent."
187,"Our approach was along a nice driveway (photo 1) towards car park area, which is large with 9 disabled bays close to the main entrance (photo 2), which itself is through an archway (photo 3) wide enough for wheelchair or scooter to easily get through and all on the level.
A truly delightful courtyard welcomes you to sit in among the flower beds, and there is a ramp (photo 4 ) is help you move around.
The first little shop we visited was a gift shop, (photo 5) full of interesting knickknacks 
that we could browse through, (photo 6)  and this is all on the level. (photo 7).
We then went through another archway (photo 8) with quite a few little stalls to see,  
all on level polished brickwork paving for easy access (photo 9). There was a sweet shop with large glass jars, (photo 10) then we entered a little shop selling cards, framed  pictures and other gifts (photo 11). Back in the beautiful courtyard, (photo 12) a picture postcard Tea room (photo 13) draws you towards it. Beside the lovely flower display the entrance awaits (photo 14). There is a small low step to get you into the Tea room, which is manageable, although we chose to leave our wheelchair outside. The entrance is all on the level and is very appealing (photo 15). There are a number of rooms for you to choice where to sit to enjoy your refreshment and the restaurant is very nicely laid with dark relaxing cane furniture (photo 16), and there is a terraced area outside, also tastefully inviting. We sat inside to enjoy our toasted tea cake and coffee, along with quite a few others also enjoying their selection.  
As you exit, there is a toilet by the entrance door, (photo 17) very basic with bare necessities, (photo 18) although this is not the actual disabled toilet.
Linking the courtyard lies a compressed gravel pathway (photo 19) passing a couple of lovely small shops, which is very easy to move along with your wheelchair, leading to the disabled toilet (photo 20). 
Our final thoughts
 If you enjoy these converted shopping villages, then this one is for you and is a must when visiting Northampton area and the other places around here we have reviewed for you. You will spend quite a bit of time happily browsing through all the different shops and the must see Tea room. 
We feel you will cope with this visit, especially if like myself you are able to get up off your wheelchair or scooter, and take a few steps on your own. However, your carer will be able to help you enjoy your visit here."
188,didn't use the toilet so can't really comment 
189,"The main entrance to Pudsey Civic Hall has automatic doors, but sadly the doors after this point are all manual & quite narrow, usually requiring both to be open to allow a normal-sized powered wheelchair through. The downstairs space is large & space will vary depending on the event hosted there. The lift is accessed by going through the main space and a fire exit, which is awkward. The little is small, without mirrors, & is scarily close to the stairs. It makes disconcerting sounds, jolts, & the doors take ages to open. Genuinely terrifying, & I've been in some scary lifts. The corridor upstairs is extremely narrow, & the landing area very quickly becomes crowded. There is 1 disabled toilet on the ground floor which is clean & spacious. The venue is accessible in that I can get through the door, but clearly the building was designed with disability as an afterthought. I believe there are parking spaces nearby. There are busses & trains in the area."
190,"This is one of my step fathers favourite little cafes to go in, although it's more Christian based cafe with a little shop at the end for Christians out there that wish to buy their faiths items etc.  Myself not being a Christian felt a bit uneasy but they do lovely jacket potatoes and food.  Nice hot chocolate and cappachinos for step dad! Would recommend their little fruit buns too.  Two disabled toilets which is unusual as most cafes here just have one.  Hand santiser and one way system, might be a bit tricky to get a large wheelchair around."
191,"Not sure of public transport, but 3 disabled parking spaces right by the entrance pass."
192,Plenty of car parks with numerous disabled spaces. 
193,We only used the toilet in the room which was very spacious for my wheelchair.
194,It's perfect.
195,"the trains are regular to Glasgow, I dont know about car parking but I think the buses are regular to here"
196,"Step free, some small gradients on compact earth paths. Some paths are paved with a little loose shingle. The best camera views are right next to the lakes which involves going into grass for a few metres. There are no barriers and some large drops of the grass into the lake so caution is needed. The map was a little misleading but once at the lakes it was easy because each lake was next to the last one. A few paths are labelled no wheelchair access including one bridge and part of a woodland walk on the other side. We went to take photos of the autumn colours and a few hours was enough time to walk around the lakes. 

The gift shop is accessible but a little tight in parts to move around. Payment desks were low and lots of staff on hand to help."
197,"We drove to Barn at Beal. There is a good sized carpark with several disabled parking bays which are situated just beside the ramp to access the building.
"
198,Staff in the centre are good. Shop staff can be helpful or a little patronising (talking to the people with you on your behalf).
199,accessible facilities including level access shower and appropriate toilet - shower seat also available and conventently placed next to one of the accessible bedrooms 
200,"From the limited interaction I had with them, they seemed lovely.  Helped me tidy up before I left, smiled and said hi when I entered."
201,Disabled access inside the venue is perfect it is all level access from room to room and wide open areas for easy turning. There are seating areas in every area in the cafe areas and on some of the wall areas. The only part that lets the the venue down on disabled access is the outside of the building on and out of the venue as the paths are narrow and if a car parks with their bumper over the kurb you have to go up and down side of ramped areas that have a little step to get the wheelchair up.
202,Level access and lift to. Concert hall .
203,"Brilliant staff , beautiful scenery and wildlife and accessible for all ages and disabilities"
204,Good gym with friendly staff. Very spacious with good equipment.
205,There were plenty of loos.
206,5* for the parts of the tour led by Jon the driver and Dominic the guide. Another driver was charmless and even sped past people waiting to board. I would recommend you do the tour with live guide. Commented tour is best for non English languages. 
207,"Great little pub. Serves breakfast from 10am. Great food menu. Range of food from burgers, ploughman salads, bar food, steaks, sandwiches and specials. Range of soft drinks, ales, coffee etc... Traditional beams country pub. Large car park. Wheelchair accessible. Very friendly staff. Good value."
208,"Since my previous 2 visits, the accessibility at The Enchanted Forest has improved greatly and during this visit I didn’t encounter any problems in my wheelchair. I didn’t get stuck this time."
209,"Access to the cinema was good with wide corridors and ramps. Using the lifts in the shopping centre to get from the car park into the cinema can take a while, especially during shopping hours, as only 2 lifts for the whole area "
210,"This is a delightful hotel worth an afternoon visit, with beautiful grounds, two duck ponds, canalside restaurant, history, and cannot be beaten on a warm sunny summer day. 
HOWEVER, IT IS NOT WHEELCHAIR FRIENDLY. Sadly, we found it very difficult to get around, to many steps, slopes to fight, narrow doorways, and we must say, nearly all the staff were not interested in helping, so it was very disappointing for us, but at the same time, we still enjoy visiting this hotel as often as we can, it’s become a favourite afternoon visit over the years, SO DO NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF, it’s a delightful hotel in its own right, and we would encourage you to go and enjoy a visit here.

You will notice that we have offered you three reviews, it is a nice place, so reading will help you make up your mind as to visiting.

On this part one, we show you the hotel itself, and a little about its history.

First of all, as you drive along country lanes bounded by farmland and open fields. and through Acton Trussell, the modern well kept houses welcome you after your short drive (having more than likely just come off the M6) you pass by many lovely modern homes with well kept gardens.
The village of Acton, (Saxon name Actone, Ac the name for Oak, and Ton meaning settlement) is mentioned in the Doomsday book, and the village of that time, 1086, had just 18 holdings, with the Tenant-in-chief of the manor being the Bishop of Chester.
Then a record of the 1300’s shows a John Trussell living in the Manor, and in 1320 timber framing has been discovered on a small mound of the property, and this manor remained in the family line until the 1500 hundreds.

Driving through the village you quickly arrive at the small sign and driveway for the Moathouse, which you first see overlooking a lake and well kept grounds.
For the disabled, it is best to drive immediately to the right on a driveway, and head for the old house and park up alongside the entrance for the hotel which has four disabled bays (photo 1). Ahead stands the delightful looking 14th century Manor (photo 2) but you will need to walk past the main door to reach the path and a ramp to help you get into the hotel (3) you can see the ramp on (photo 4) Then it’s in through a pull handle door and up to a large wooden reception desk. (5). Opposite is a lovely sitting area (6) which was very comfortable and pleasant area to sit (7) while my husband took a few photos of the hotel. A wide passage led towards toilets (8) with disabled in the centre (9) which was spacious, very clean and simply tiled in light colours (10) with grab rails and pull cord.
Further passages showed the way towards the bar and restaurant (photo 11) passing a delightful and cosy looking lounge (12 and 13) and other corridors led to bedrooms (14).
Now the annoying bit, after guiding his wheelchair along corridors, and bends to reach the bar, you are faced with steps, that no wheelchair user can get up, and had to come all the way back to reception desk, to go out of the entrance, down the ramp, along and uphill to the far end of the hotel buildings before struggling in through a pull handled doorway to get into the passage (photo 15) then pull handle doors again (16) which was very difficult to manage on his own, and had to get up out of chair, no staff willing to come and help, before checking out the bar (17) and a warming well lit fireplace (18) but now faced with having to come back all the way through corridors with pull handle doors, our to the pathway and ramps, up into the hotel entrance, struggle to use pull handle doors before getting back to reception desk to let me know we would have to do that walk again if we wanted a drink. 

It would have perhaps been easier if staff helped a bit more, but for most of our day we were ignored, and it’s because of the difficulty of getting around, and receiving very little help, that we would suggest you thinking carefully about making use of the hotel, and that’s a shame, because able bodied visitors would really like this place, it’s very popular."
211,Great! The museum itself is a glass room all on one level. All exhibits were in glass cases that were at around waist height. There was a good ramp leading up to it too.
212,"I want to praise this hotel particularly because it had a family room with an accessible bathroom - something which can be a real pain to find, as it's usually assumed that disabled people won't have children... It had step free access to the communal areas and our  bedroom, and was clean, comfortable, central and good value for money."
213,The couple who were our contacts were very helpful. I did not need to contact them re access issues.
214,The cafe has waiter service. I was welcomed in and service was prompt and very good.
215,It is level access to the store. Automatic doors open to let you in. There  is plenty of space to manoeuvre.
216,Step free entrance with large revolving doors and a dedicated automatic door.  There is a lift to take you up to the show room and restaurant/cafeteria. See photo .  There are large bollards that surround the area just outside the exit doors.  This is to prevent customers from taking their trolleys away  from the building but it does mean that wheelchair users and Proms have to exit via a bell controlled gate.  It can take some time before somebody opens the gate  which in bad weather is annoying.See photos
217,"The Staff at the St.Vincent Arms are happy to help no matter what the problem, they are always very friendly."
218,"Surgeon's Hall is set back from the road and is in its own small garden. There is step free access from the pavement to the museum, and there is a path through the garden, see photo. There are automatic entrance doors, which had a push button. Inside there are stairs and a lift which takes you up to the museum entrance on the third floor. Both the History of Surgery Museum and the Wohl Pathology Museum had step free access. Although the upper floor of the Pathology Museum has narrow doorways and this might not be suitable for some wheelchair users.

Both exhibtions are laid out like a traditional museum with cabinets, exhibites and information boards. Some of the objects are easier to view than others. Photos are not allowed inside the museum."
219,"The organisation does its utmost to ensure wheelchair users are made very welcome:
- All staff were extremely helpful
- Entryway, cafe, gift shop and toilets on one level
- Concessionary Access price, and carer can enter free of charge
- Small cafe with enough space for wheelchair users

Two doorways into the Chapel, one is very narrow. But other entrance has double-doors.
Crypt only accessible via stairs. However staff have a booklet containing photos of crypt, for those unable to use stairs.

Exterior of the Chapel has gravel chips all the way round, supported by driveway grid, therefore relatively level and consistent."
220,"Lots of space at the Brentford Gate, close to entrance."
221,"Getting into the building at reception requires a key fob, or you need to buzz. The doors aren't automatic however, and there are two sets of glass doors to go through. Once inside the floor is nice and smooth and the light is bright. The lift is through a set of heavy double doors which are sometimes propped open. This is also where there is an accessible toilet. The building is a bit of a maze if you need step free access, as the lift takes a bit of getting used to!"
222,"Super helpful, knowledgeable and enthusiastic. "
223,"Good, clean, well appointed toilet but difficult for chair users because of that narrow turn."
224,Main event had adjoining car park. Marquee no parking but drop off ok. 
225,"The accessible toilet was just big enough for a wheelchair user and someone to assist them. It didn’t have an emergency red cord though which are very important and it could do with a little bit of a freshen up, a lick of paint or something. Wheelchair users would only be able to transfer from the left-hand side of the toilet.

There is no Changing Places toilet here. The closest one is roughly a 9-minute drive away in the Macrobert Art Centre."
226,"I spotted fully working lifts, ramps and wide doorways."
227,"There are disabled spaces but they do fill up quite quickly so an early start is recommended. It’s not tarmac , more stone but the scooter coped well. "
228,Accommodation is all on one level so no issues getting to the toilet
229,"Easy access with wheelchair, they do have an accessible toilet, however there were loads of high chairs stacked up outside of it that had to be moved before we could get in and although there were handles in the wall there was no drop down handle that we need as my wife only has the use of one arm.
Decent food, some portions were quite big for tapas so watch how
Many you order,could do with a more extensive wine list "
230,ground floor loo wheelchair friendly
231,Always very attentive.
232,Friendly and welcoming.
233,The staff are great at choosing a table that suits your needs. You can wheel in with level access from the Omni. There's space to easily wheel to a table. The tables are at a reasonable height for wheelchair access and many of them can be moved if required.
234,Easy access and good parking facilities
235,"We had a brilliant day out at Landmark Forest Adventure Park, and while not everything is fully accessible, all of the activities are visible and in the open which makes it a great place to go with all the family. The accessible treetop trail is fantastic as well."
236,Staff were very friendly and helpful in accessing the hangers and serving food.
237,"Phoenix Park is easily accessed by public transport, The Red Line of the Luas (Tram) stops at Heuston Station which is within a 5 minute wheel of the park. "
238,"Our trip today included a visit to the Black Boy pub in Knowle, and is part of our historic canal tour around Stratford apon Avon area, which we will offer you details of our tour at a later date.  It is situated just outside Henley in Arden, and the attractive little town lies in Warwickshire, in an area that at one time was forested, and then known as the Forest in Arden. In 1140 the first charter was granted so that a market could be held at Beaudesert, which helped the growth of Henley, and  
following this, in 1220, Henry 111 granted Peter de Montford a royal charter which allowed a market to be held at Henley in Arden. Peter, and his more well known brother, Simon de Montford, were both killed at the battle of Evesham in August 1265. 
Today, a few buildings remain in Henley of historic interest, such as the Guild hall, and the one mile long High street has many historical buildings you may like to see. The small town is now a popular destination when visiting Stratford apon Avon, which is only 8 miles away.
The pub we visited is not the original Black Boy, which stood some distance away, but these premises were built in 1793 to take advantage of the growing canal trade.The new owners the Rigby family restored the old pub in 1993 .
It is thought the name Black Boy was named after King Charles 11,  a nickname given to him by his mother Queen Henrietta Maria. The merry King, Charles Stuart 11; was known as the black King of England, the word Stuart coming from the old Nordish root Svart, which means black. Like his ancestors before him, King Charles 11 was very dark skinned, but he is falsely painted white in paintings. He was born in 1630, and was nicknamed the black boy by his mother Queen Henrietta Maria, because of his dark appearance
His appearance certainly wasn’t English, he had a dark complexion, black hair and dark brown eyes, he resembled his Italian maternal grandmother Marie de Medici side of the family. He was 6 feet 2 inches tall, inherited from his Danish paternal grandmother Anne of Denmark. He died without an official heir on 6th February 1685, having survived the Bubonic plague.
All English pubs named the Black Boy are named after this Charles 11, because of his dark complexion.
The journey to the Black Boy pub is a very scenic trip, through remnants of the forest (photo 1) which gave Henley its old name Forest in Arden. The driveway up to the pub was very intriguing, and again very scenic (photo 2), and when we saw the pub it looked colourful with many flowers and made us feel we wanted to see more. (Photo 3).  The car park is large with two disabled bays, and it’s all on the level, an easy push for wheelchair along compressed ground (photo 4). The main entrance is on the level, (photo 5) but there is a notice saying no pushchairs or prams, but a wheelchair or power chair etc is allowed access through this door, as stated by staff.  However, if you wish to sit outside, which is alongside a scenic canal, you have to go along a side entrance (photo 6) although narrow, power chairs will get through. The outside 
Area is very pleasant, right by the canal with many barges moored or passing by. (photo 7). The seating area is very pleasant (photo 8) with many tables and chairs as you enter along a paved area, and beyond this is a grassy area (photo 9) with concrete paths to go along to reach these tables. Moving around is not a problem. However, it sadly is not very clean, tables cluttered and a general feeling of neglect. If you do decide to sit outside, the staff are non existent, so you have to go and order for yourself at the bar, but to my husbands concern, he found two high steps waiting for him, so impossible for a disabled person, unless you go back along the passageway to the main door which is a bit of a bother to have to do.
The interior is very basic, (photo 11) uninviting, doesn’t draw you to want to sit there and relax. The bar itself was just as basic (photo 12) with what seemed a limited choice in drinks. You need to move around pub to reach disabled toilet (photo 13) and The disabled toilet has to be opened by a key collected from staff, so you could be waiting a long time. (photo 14) and we were concerned about using it, so cannot advice you as to size or facilities. Other dinning areas were just as uninspiring (photo 15), but sadly, it is in a lovely setting when sitting outside, so management need to sit and discuss a way forward if wanting to keep customers returning, or eventually the uninterested attitude of staff will catch them out, and they could loose out on a good thing, as many people do love these canal outlooks (photo 16) "
239,Easy to access shop and speak to friendly staff who have loads of experience helping people with disabilities try water sports. They want as many people as they can try to get involved with sports on the river and will go out of their way to help.
240,"Good, but one misses Lothian Buses' power-operated ramps. The double doors are wide and the wheelchair/buggy spaces just inside them. This 66 year-old accompanist was able to get wife & wheelchair on and off buses without the need of a ramp. A ramp would be essential for solo wheelchair users and power chair users."
241,There is an accessible toilet
242,Toilets seemed to be available on nearly every floor.
243,Very helpful. Made sure we had a table that was the right height for a wheelchair user.
244,Number 8 bus goes down and up Broughton Street regularly 
245,"If you book in advance they have a secure car park with spaces for blue badge holders or people on their access list. There is no charge for this. It's approx 25yds from the front door, less on the way out as they open a side door. I managed to book a space on a busy Friday night, same day, and needed to collect the parking voucher from the box office. Excellent facility."
246,"This can be a difficult place to find, as each time we have visited, we cannot follow Sat NAV, it just says that the area cannot be picked up, and we have to find our own way there, so try following our easy directions for you, just in case your sat NAV will not register. Its worth the effort if you like small chic shopping stores.

First of all, set your sat NAV to a place that will be shown on sat NAV.      CV35 7JJ.
This will take you to Hatton Arms inn.  It will be closed until 12.00 but it’s your start.

TURN LEFT from the inn on A4177, then immediately TURN LEFT on B4439. 
Take note of brown signboard for Hatton country park.
A short drive later, at cross roads, TURN LEFT on brown sign Hatton country world and for Norton Lindsey.
Cross the Grand Union canal, and then railway bridge.
Then a few yards later, TURN LEFT for Hatton country world.
Stay to the right at junction by school sign, and drive up to car park.
Don’t bother to try to find disabled parking, just park as you need.
WATCH YOUR TIME HERE, I HOUR IS FREE, then it’s £2 for the rest of your time here.

TO RETURN TO HATTON ARMS INN
Return from car park to country lane.
TURN RIGHT, after leaving car park. cross railway and canal. TURN RIGHT AGAIN
TURN RIGHT AT A4177 and return to Hatton Arms
Then resume your journey to next destination.


OUR REVIEW
The village does not open until 10.00, so set sat NAV to get you here for 10.00. 
There are disabled bays, (photo 1) but anywhere will do you.  The area is a rough uneven roadway, not well maintained, and even uphill in places. Just beyond disabled bays is a entrance into shops, with a parking machine if you feel you will be more than an hour, we have always moved off before the hour is up. 
The main walk for shops is near to disabled bays, as you came in (photo 2) again with a bit of a push needed to move along, but you quickly arrive at the first little shop (3) usually a good selection at reasonable costs. (4).  Other shops include the sweet shop (5) but more interesting is the distillery (6).
You will soon arrive at the far end of shops and get to the entrance for the childrens  
Adventure world, (7) but from what we have seen the park is for very young toddlers and rather expensive for what they seem to get, but at least it’s a day out for the kids. In the park itself you will find some shops, and a restaurant (photo 8). 

Actually there is a lot of things that should amuse the kids (9) with paths leading all round the park (10) and for parents, plenty of seating (11)
The main path leads you back towards other shops now (12), that hold small stalls as well (13)  before arriving at the bull pen shops(14) and antique shop (15) and passing a garden centre (16) then it’s out by passing car park machine (17)  and your return journey to the next port of call.

A fascinating place to visit, although we felt this was not as good as our first visit here, as not many of the shops were open.  
The adventure park was good for toddlers and young families, but we felt very expensive for what you got."
247,"please see my review, this will soon be a five star toilet.  The owner will be installing a new grabrail"
248,"Signage around the station is clear and there are ramps at the entrance and exit to the ticket office with automatic doors. An automated ticket machine is available on the platform if accessing the office is difficult.

There are several benches on both platforms and a shelter with seating on platform 2.

The new lifts are located close to the ticket office and are clearly sign posted."
249,My friend asked a member of staff to open the side fire exit door and I used the slope to get to the door. Once in it was all flat. The food was lovely and the staff were friendly and helpful. The bar in the next room sales great cocktails.
250,I would recommend trying to sit by the loos which are at the back if you use the outside entrance or at the front if you enter from inside the outlet village. This means you don’t have to travel through as many tight spaces to get to the toilet. Disabled toilet is decent.
251,"Helped with heavy doors at entrance, good at pointing the way."
252,"There is no disabled parking which I seen. So being a wheelchair user, I need room to get out and back into my car and have the confidence that no one will park next to me to obstruct me getting back into my car. I parked down at the main car park and there is no drop curd to get up onto the pavement. They do have a very small movable ramp to get up onto the pavement but caution is advised as someone could easily tip out of their chair when using it."
253,"Loo accessible (unisex Radar key) good space for carer to assist. Clean, grab rails and easy to find. Monitored by security so only used by those meant to use it!"
254,"excellent access for people with disabilities, lifts for wheelchair access to the post office."
255,There is lift and quite a lot of seating like chairs and sofas.
256,"Room was very small, asked for bed to be raised for hoist access, which it was but the bed was left in the middle of the room, so no room to get passed. Thick carpet in room made pushing hoist extremely difficult."
257,"There is one and it's big enough with handrails but you need to use a radar key, which they have behind the bar if you don't have one. I didn't check it this time but the lock was broken last  summer for some time."
258,"I did not have reason to speak with staff, but they are easily seen around the place and I felt I could have asked for their help if I needed it.
There are staffed desks at each of the entrances.
The museum was quite busy, with a mixture of visitors including families and school groups, everyone seemed to be welcomed."
259,"Good Lothian Bus links with stops on Broughton Street. Some on street parking, but not guaranteed. "
260,"Several steps to main entrance, wheelchair access is along the side of the building and up a ramp. This door is a fire door and has to be opened from inside. My friend had to leave me in the  wind & rain and go back around the building to main entrance to gain access. The surface outside to the ramp looks as though it would be quite slippy underfoot when wet.There is a lift to upper floors. Plenty of seating for a rest, but quite a long corridor from accessible entrance to public area"
261,"Check in was a wee bit slow due to  ‘the system’ being down and things had to be done manually.  Key cars allocated, we headed to our rooms.  The wheelchair room was fairly close to reception but in order to get to my room I had to go along one long corridor and then along another of similar length. I have to say by the time I  got to my room I was completely shattered.
Once in the room, it was massive!.  A large double bed and another single away in the corner of the room beside a desk and sofa.  The hairdryer was tucked away under the kettle with tea and coffee.  Typical open wardrobe (I can never get the hangers back on using one hand), shelves and power points, althought there wasn’t any beside the bed or even USB charge points such as in a Hoiliday  Express. Just a personal thing, but I did find the bed rather soft and low down.  I suppose not having a grab rail (nor my ‘Better half’) I did find it a bit difficult getting out of bed in the morning"
262,We didn't use the car park but did use the transport to the hotel which was first class. The return trip to the airport they didn't send a wheelchair accessible van so we had an hour wait. When we did get the van it was first class.
263,"The toilets were used for both disabled & baby change, This meant that the bins were overflowing with nappy sacks as no one had cleaned them."
264,On Victoria Street which is not ideal for parking! Best bet is getting a bus to George IV bridge.
265,1 was very nice and helped however he could.  The other kept insisting we were disabled and should be sat in our wheelchairs as only paid for 1 seat 
266,Fantastic. Really helpful onboard and off. Explain how ticketing works clearly and you can hear them offering help to everyone on board for whatever reason. 
267,"There are very few Disabled parking bays for such a new building which is very disappointing.
There is a vast car park with lots of parking space for abled bodied people.
There is no public transport to the Garden Centre and it is a good 30 minute walk from the bus stop to the actual venue "
268,Access was pretty good as the doors were wide enough to easily wheel in and one set were automated with push button pads. Once inside there was ample space to get around and see most things. There was a mezzanine level displaying bicycles - this wasn't accessible.
269,"Probably the last store of its kind in Scotland even though it’s not independent. All the Fraser stores carry pretty much the same stock, but this is the flagship store in Scotland, the customer service still has a bygone era feel to it especially among the older, experienced staff. There are more entrance and exit doors than most other Department Stores of which 4 double sets are power assisted and once in the Store, ample ramps and lifts throughout. As said earlier, being the flagship, we can only get particular products that we like here, one Edinburgh Store has closed followed by what used be Jenner’s in Edinburgh at a later date. The Hermes boutique shop offers a range of unique Hermes products and to accompany it, the service to match. The staff cannot do enough to assist with a patience to match. They also have the awareness and the observation to recognise and be alert to offer support. "
270,I used the toilet at the pier there is one at the entrance to the pier and one in the Terrace Bar. Adequate for my scooter but not ultra modern. 
271,"There was a disabled toilet next to the main car park, although this was an outdoor toilet. There was also an indoor toilet available in the main building. "
272,No steps entrance door wide enough and level. Soft play and cafe on one level. 
273,The staff were as helpful and as patient as they could be but the fact remains there is NO LIFT to the stalls. I was told this is because it is a listed building and therefore not allowed to install one.
274,"Wheelchair accessible,  all on the flat. Lacking disabled toilets though.  Drink cheap! Large wheelchair friendly function room"
275,"City Centre location, on street parking fairly close.  Didn't use transport on this occasion."
276,Helpful staff.
277,All the staff are great. There are plenty of staff who are all clearly made out by their distinctive uniforms. Also they are only too happy to help you out.
278,the staff were very well informed about access and explained which paths might not be suitable for my chair.
279,"Disabled parking very limited, but public transport is excellent and highly accessible."
280,Overall Nuffield health Milngavie is very accommodating to people with disabilities through implementing a wheelchair lift and disabled parking. This creates a positive atmosphere for visitors who require this service. 
281,The carpark has amply disabled parking
282,There is a dedicated blue badge parking space right beside the door. Blakeney is right by the sea in rural Norfolk so public transport is a lot trickier!
283,A good height with foldable rails to either side.
284,The parking is near the ramp to get into the chalet
285,"East to find, wide door, I didn't notice anything else which makes it particularly suited to a disabled user."
286,Limited parking but accessible buses stop very close by.
287,Didn't have much contact with staff but spoke to someone twice who was polite and friendly. 
288,"As it's in the West End, driving is a bit of a non starter. Nearest stepfree tube is quite a way. We walked/wheeled from Waterloo which was a good 25 minutes."
289,"All staff I encountered were keen to be helpful. Someone should tell them that it's OK to smile occasionally - they were needlessly severe and humourless, and occasionally a tiny bit officious."
290,"There is a step into the café. They have an extravagantly long folding metal ramp which they can deploy whenever you need it, and because it's so long you get a lovely smooth gentle ride up to the entrance. Some of the waiters and waitresses don't know about the existence of this ramp (the manager hasn't briefed them properly) so if you ask and you're told ""We don't have a ramp"", don't believe them!"
291,"The welcome from the staff as second to none. As it's a family run farm shop, everyone coming in and leaving the shop while I was there were treated like family too. There was a lovely atmosphere in the store."
292,"Savignypl. 11, 10623 Berlin, Germany, 
There are  about 10 restaurants in this lovely little square, after visiting them all to try and get dinner, I found this was the only one with a disable toilet. It is a great busy place about a miles walk (or wheel) from the zoo, great to eat out of an evening and they do great Vietnamese food"
293,Limited on street parking. Adjacent to the station and the Airlink bus services.
294,"Step-free entry into the bookshop, but I was unable to get at most of the bookshelves. Not recommended for wheelchair users."
295,"Absolutely fantastic service, I rented an electric wheelchair to avoid taking mine abroad in case the airline damaged it. The chair I was provided with was fantastic for the terrain and enabled me to go wherever I wanted independently. The gentleman Frederico met me at the hotel lobby at the time arranged and as he was running late we left the chair in the lobby with reception for collection. I am quite small and of course rental chairs are generally larger than ones I require but we found it very easy to use pillows and my own cushions from my manual wheelchair to make it suitable - however it maybe necessary that certain extra cushions are taken to make the chairs fit every individual. The chair we hired was a Terra which I'd not heard of before but was definitely the best electric wheelchair I've hired abroad. It had a great range, managed small kerbs and bumps with ease, had a small wheelbase with great turning circle and fitted on all the buses easily. It definitely made the holiday a holiday for all. I'd definitely recommend Amigo 24 for any electric wheelchair hire in the future if we end up in an area that they operate in. They also hire out manual wheelchairs and mobility scooters as well as other mobility and disability aids which can be incredibly handy and helpful whilst away on holiday. "
296,"In my room I had an accessible toilet with a single grab rail and in the ground floor communal area there was also an accessible public toilet. It was signposted from reception. There was a manual door into the sink area which had wheelchair space below. Then there was a second manual door into the spacious toilet area. There was a single grab rail, see photos. There was no emergency cord and the door was unlocked/ didn’t require a special key to open it. The toilet was very clean."
297,"Parking is probably one of the weak spots as it is not easy to park in the area. That said, it is true of so many places in the city during the festivals. Bus travel was easier with Princes Street only a short five minute walk away. "
298,"Perfectly OK, told us where the lift was, staff appeared when needed. "
299,We were able to get the information we wanted from the website prior to visiting. We ordered tickets by post. Once in town the service was very accessible for us and easy use as a powerchair user.
300,staf were very helpful & friendly.
301,There are 2 ramps giving access to clubhouse
302,The toilet facilities are accessible for wheelchair users
303,The parking is good but the park gets busy. Edgebaston cricket ground is just over the road so avoid match das as parking gets full.
304,Easy to park and good range of level access shops but no public toilets.
305,Car parking space right outside the door.
306,The Brooks Hotel was not what I expected although I’m not sure what that was. Going in the door the magic began to unfold as it was a cross between Alice in Wonderland and Harry Potter. Every corner revealed something different and exciting.
307,"Our tour guide Laura was lovely, she had been out the night before scouting the location and making sure that all the places she wanted to show us were accessible. She was friendly, funny and easy to chat to. She made sure that everyone in the group was comfortable with the pace and volume of the tour and ensured that we were all enjoying ourselves. I would recommend this tour wholeheartedly."
308,"The nearest tube station South Kensington is not step free. Although the Piccadilly, District and Circle line stop there all the platforms involve steps to the ticket office hall level and then further steps to street level. This is really disappointing. There are a number of buses that stop outside or near to the V and A. I would suggest picking up bus no 14 from Green Park which is an step free station. "
309,There are many toilet facilities throughout the venue that are all fully accessible. 
310,The staff were increadibly kind and caring. We were looked after from the security men to the customer shop to the people in the shop. Every was really kind. 
311,"Although it is a 300-year old coaching inn, the owners have tried hard to make access as good as it can possibly be. The level access entrance porch door has a clearance of 26 inches, then a sharp left turn leading into the reception area. On our visit, the wheelchair user was in a Sunrise Quickie 6-wheel and she is a very experienced driver. She managed with relative ease, but anyone with a larger manual or powered wheelchair might struggle to manoeuvre. Previous diners using a wheelchair have opted to phone ahead to check access and one keen diner even visited ahead of booking to make sure she wasn't disappointed. Staff are more than happy to discuss your access needs in advance to ensure you have a positive experience. 

The reception/ bar and restaurant are on ground floor level and have level access throughout. There are no doors between each of the 3 dining areas. The reception area has comfy chairs and fixed, padded, bench-type seating, all without arms. A seat with arms can be made available and all tables and chairs in this area can be moved around if required. The reception/ bar area has wooden flooring and there is short pile carpet in the dining rooms. Diners can enjoy aperitifs and canapés in comfort whilst choosing from the menu and are then escorted to their table once their meal is ready. All dietary requirements can be catered for with prior notice.

Lighting throughout the building is natural daylight. There are wall lights, and candles on tables throughout the restaurant. For guests staying in The Residence, there is good lighting throughout the car park and between the bedrooms and the restaurant. There is a monobloc path from The Residence to the restaurant with a slight gradual slope from the Residence. 

There is a manual, double glass door at the entrance to The Residence, with a very small raised lip. A member of staff is normally on duty at reception between 8.30am and 8pm to assist if required. There are eight suites in The Residence, seven of which are split level with bedroom and bathroom on the lower floor plus a separate living room on the upstairs mezzanine level. The corridor and rooms are carpeted.  There is also a fire door half way along the corridor, which shortens the distance from The Residence to the car park and the restaurant. At the far end of the corridor, there is one level, designated accessible room with lots of space to move around, plus a luxurious, en suite wet-room. There is a small, raised lip of 1.5 cm to shower entry. There are lever taps on the washbasin and bath, with horizontal and vertical, colour-contrasted grab rails around the shower. The floor is tiled and there are down-lights throughout bathroom. All bedroom furniture can be moved to suit guests' needs. The wardrobe has a pull-down rail for easy access. 
"
312,"The accessible loo was easy to find, very spacious and well-facilitated and clean."
313,"For a busy, modern day airport terminal what you would and should expect, all areas fully accessible, ample seating with refreshment and food outlets.
The Fullers London Pride outlet offered BSL and large Print assistance."
314,The staff are friendly and helpful but on busy days it can be a long wait till order taken.
315,One member of staff was friendly and helpful and directed me to the toilets.
316,"The venue has one or two disabled parking spaces, there are good bus links and on street parking nearby."
317,Private car park at back of hotel with disabled access to reception
318,"Friendly, local staff. Never had anyone question me for not looking disabled when I have purchased a disabled ticket or requested a seat reservation."
319,"Some treatment rooms not accessible for wheelchairs. Waiting area has nowhere to 'park' so you are not in the way of other patients. 'Disabled' toilet cannot accommodate a chair, no grab rail on one side of toiletand door will not close with a self propelling standard sized chair inside"
320,"There is disabled access, lifts, several accessible toilets, induction loops, large print maps, wheelchair hire and registered assistance dogs are permitted"
321,Was at Newcastle at weekend and found building called the Baltic. Just wonderful things going on....wonderful views of all the bridges.
322,Staff are helpful and friendly.
323,Access around the whole apartment building where we went was 1st class. 
324,The cafe is up on the old platform in the old waiting room. It’s a steep ramp to get up on to the platform. The entry to the cafe is step free at the front but has a step down to exit at the back. You can also get to the seating areas by coming back out the front and round the side. There is a marquee at platform level with seating in or down the ramp there is a level floor hexagonal covered seating area or a wooden area but this has a step. 
325,"Ramp,entrance and toilet facilities good but no access to upstairs"
326,"The Regal is a Wetherspoons pub and club just outside of the centre of town. This venue is completely accessible for a wheelchair user, however it is let down by how crowded it can get on a Friday and Saturday night."
327,King's Cross underground station serves both King's Cross and St Pancras International railway stations. There are several bus routes that stop outside.
328,Excellent and very friendly! They make sure the facilities are extremely clean. 
329,The access is very good indeed for all types of chairs and scooter as well although. You have to leave the scooter downstairs
330,"Very friendly and helpful. Asked if I needed and assistance, showed me to the changing room to try my purchase. "
331,Disabled parking available that is free of charge.
332,"Very good , wheelchair friendly"
333,"The toilets were of a high standard. They were spacious, clean and there was plenty of them. There was a disabled toilet which had plenty of room and grab rails included."
334,"There are wide automatic doors on entrance to the foyer of the theatre and a low counter at the box office till. A lift can take customers to the studio, main house, dress circle and theatre bars. Wheelchair spaces are available in the theatre stalls and circles if pre-booked. Assistance dogs are allowed in all parts of the theatre. For hearing impaired individuals, a loop system is available from the box office counter. Brochures are also available in large print and audio transcribed formats. There are BSL performances on specific showings as well as audio described performances. Staff also explained that they provided easy read maps of the theatre layout to individuals to reassure them of the place before they entered. Similarly, there are also touch tours at the theatre, where individuals familiarise themselves with the set, props and costumes before the performance. "
335,Level access in the church. The only challenge is getting up the short hill to get in (and cobbles at the entrance to the path)
336,For me the access was great. I only awarded three stars as it would have been great to see them have a wheelchair accessible 'car' on the train. I didn't manage to see or find one. I particularly liked the audio commentary as it brought things alive for me as I may not have known what I was looking at otherwise!
337,"No step at door, inside it's a bit tight but I am sure they would serve you outside"
338,"Car parking is behind the venue, buses pass nearby and taxis can also stop nearby. It is level access from these drop off points into the venue."
339,"Superb accessible toilet just of the main cafe area. Good wide door, bright and light, with plenty of space to manoeuvre. Easily room for a carer / PA if required. Grab rails and fittings all at good height and easy to access."
340,All very friendly  and helpful
341,"There is space to temporarily park outside the restaurant however for a longer-stay disabled parking bay, they are round the corner at a further distance. There is flat ground throughout the town centre if you were to access the restaurant from already being in the town. There are no bus stops immediately by the restaurant, however there are within a 5-10 minute walk. "
342,"The red cord in the disabled toilet was tucked behind a pipe and had been cut short by approximately one metre.

I untucked it to let it hang before attaching a Euan's Guide Card.

"
343,The buses to downtown Disney springs are fully accessible and everything is flat and accessible.  The car park is a long way from the rainforest cafe though so I wouldn't recommend driving
344,"As always I check out the disabled loos, most of them didnt even have an emergency cord, one I couldnt even get my wheelchair in, another had more spiders in than I was willing to sit around and count,  One of the 'new loos' which had one an award, had the red cord so tight in the corner behind the loo that it would be impossible to get to if you fell,  Most of the attractions although say they are accessible are not truly if you cannot walk, on the 'Thomas' Train I had to wait until everyone was on so the train could pull forward as the barrier was in the way and couldnt turn my wheelchair to get up the ramp. on the Drayton Manor train I could get on fine, but there was a step that made it near impossible to get off again the guard had to push my electric chair.  Most rides unless u can walk are not accesible I am fortunate that I can partly weight bare, or I would have been excluded from even more rides."
345,"Chose to go to Preston Park and Museum on a rainy day with grandkids.  Park is lovely for the kids, but the museum was a lovely surprise.  Easy access, nice wide spaces inside for our boot scooter to navigate around, lift to the relevant floors.  Displays inside small but cover a lot of things, we especially like the 'olden day's (60s/70s etc) bit upstairs of how we used to live. Also outside is a small street set up in that 'olden day' style.  Street was partly cobbled but also partly paved so again no problems for the scooter.  Nice cafe there too but we didn't use that."
346,The car park is opposite the restaurant and you have to cross a busy road.  There are traffic lights 200 metres and we were lucky because cars were stopped for the red lights and let us through.
347,Not many disabled spaces. Car park quite bumpy to get over on wheelchair wheels.
348,"The reason for the half star is that once you are in it's flat, but that's where it ends. It had a tall step to bump Pauls wheelchair up and an extremely heavy door, had we known there were no disabled toilets we wouldn't of bothered. Once inside they had booths but only for people who were eating so, as we were only in for a pint, we were directed over to a high table with high chairs. So we sat at completely different levels while we had our pint."
349,There are steps leading to the front entrance however there is a wheelchair accessible entrance with push buttons to open the doors around the side of the venue. 
350,"There is a ramp between car park and the hotels reception, it's bar and restaurant. There is a toilet for disabled in the corridor between the three.  The is a lift to rooms on the first floor.  There is a fan in the room and it's needed - it was the hottest day of the year and the room was like a sauna."
351,"The disabled facilities were clearly outlined in the brochure and included information about wheelchairs, hearing assistance, toilets, parking, assistance dogs, ear defenders, an easy read guide to visiting the festival, an easy read guide to the programme, additional needs badges and volunteer escorts.  Their brochure was also available in large print, braille, audio CD and MP3 format.  They provided details of how to contact them should help with access be required.  We used these contact details for help with our parking problems and this help was indeed provided.

The large cafe was accessible for our wheelchair users and we were able to pull tables together so that we could all sit together and watch all the activity. The food available would not necessarily have been ideal for our people with disabilities but we had brought their own food with us anyway."
352,The staff in the Sea Life Centre was helpful and gentle. At the Coffee Bar the staff was very nice. 
353,"Great little gym and nice libary - great if you just want to sit on a comfy seat and relax while reading a book. However, I mostly use the venue for the gym. As a disabled man, I feel keeping my fitness to a high level is vital so, I attend the gym in Fochabers multiple times a week. However, I feel that it is only a suitable gym for you if like myself, you have the ability to come out of your wheelchair and transfer onto the equipment.  "
354,"There is no parking at the station, unless you don't mind parking your car on the streets next to it. There is a bus stop directly infront of the stations main entrance. There is also a taxi rank outside main entrance, where you can either get dropped off or if you need a taxi, there is always taxis waiting outside."
355,Entrance straight off pavement.  Very slight lip but the door was wide enough for my wheelchair but would not suit an electric chair.  By booking early the carer could alert the waiter who opened an inner door.
356,"There is a good (free) car park with some designated accessible places.  This place is really wheelchair friendly - the paths were all accessible & I had no trouble getting round the venue.  
Had a nice sandwich & a pot of tea in the cafe.
The accessible toilet at the cafe had plenty of room, grab rails etc."
357,"Ask to drive back and park right at the museum for best wheelchair access. There are car parks, but they are far away and a very steep incline so best to park right at the museum in  back parking lot."
358,It was immediately obvious that the organisers had considered accessibility and gone to great lengths to welcome disabled visitors.
359,London Luton Airport is located north of central London. It is a smaller airport than Heathrow or Gatwick and is served by several airlines and offers flights to worldwide locations.
360,"I only interacted with the person serving at the counter, who was very friendly. The café offers self service."
361,"The whole experience of our week in The Yorkshire Dales has been excellent, a great part of this was because staying at The Dairy allowed my husband to be independent and stress free, not things that can often be guaranteed when away from home, because of different levels of accessibility in accommodation.
We took my husbands mobility  scooter as well as his wheelchair. There is plenty of all around the cottage for turning a wheelchair and the scooter was parked in the hallway next to a wall socket.
This exceptional cottage is not only completely accessible, but is also beautiful, luxurious and comfortable.
We have already booked another holiday at The Dairy."
362,"3 Lifts operated with Room Card

Accessible ramp into the hotel"
363,"Wheelchair accessible, pleasant atmosphere and good food."
364,"The countryside around here is a little hilly, rising up to 450 feet, it’s good grazing and dairy farmland, lots of trees but no large woodland as such, but a pleasure to drive along. This is a small old fashioned canal pub, close to the junction of the Grand Union canal with the Stratford and Avon canal. The canal itself reached here in 1815, and it stands next to bridge 65. The canal itself is in a very attractive area, with lots of greenery, and inviting (photo 1). It is not far from Lapworth, on the B4493, and stands next to bridge 65. We mention this simply because there is an interesting walk for the able bodied, perhaps you may have children, or your little dog needs to find a wee place, but a short circular walk can be taken from here. First of all be careful crossing the B4439 as you need to get to the other side of the bridge ahead, then there are steps that will take you down onto the towpath, then walk away from the pub, with the canal now on your left, and take the short walk to the junction of the Grand Union canal with the branch canal known as the Lapworth link,   I believe this was opened in 1995, and going along this stretch of canal will take you round to meet the junction with the Stratford and Avon canal. You can then continue along that towpath and return to B4439 to turn right and return to The Navigation, but again be careful if you have children with you. If you the disabled person wants to see this connection of canals, then you need to drive out of car park area, and turn right on B4439 and go over the little canal bridge, then just a few yards later, turn left on Brome Hall lane, and drive past the few houses to a small parking area by the waterworks buildings, and to your left is a very small car parking area on dirt. Take the path leading down to towpath, and you can enjoy the views of the canal from there. Notice the Barrel roofed cottage by junction of the Lapworth link, most unusual. It’s a nice little area around these canals, but you really need a dry day, as it’s all dirt track, and may be impossible for you to get round to the actual junction itself, but you may wish to give it a try.
So, what do we feel about “The Navigation” 
First of all make sure you have entered the Sat NAV directions for this pub, as there are three Navigation pubs in the vicinity, so enter B94 6NA for directions. We used this pub as part of our canal trip, and we will give you details on this trip later on with a fresh review of our historic canal trip.
The Navigation is in a beautiful setting alongside the Grand Union canal, and as we approached this small pub it had an appealing look about it.The car park was of a reasonable size, with easy access to the pub, simply going round the side of it into the delightful garden area, where we sat looking at the canal views with weeping willow trees, an idyllic spot for relaxing. A path takes you to the area under a canopy, (photo 3) and as it was very hot it gave plenty of shade to allow us to enjoy the surroundings. To get to the bar ready to order our drinks was easy enough, all on the level and through the little door (photo 4) then up to the bar, still all on the level.
It’s just a basic bar, nothing fancy, (photo 5) but a reasonable choice of drinks. You ride over a stone flagged floor, (photo 6)  so it was easy to get wheelchair along. There is a big log burner which we imagine in the winter when lit, would be very warm and welcoming.
Outside again, when you go through the canopy, there is a grassy area with tables and chairs (photo 7) and from here you can get unto the towpath to look over canal, but for walking you would need to get to the other side for the 
towpath. 
We enjoyed our short visit, very pleasant on this nice warm day, and enjoyed our drinks.  (photo 8). It serves a pint unique to the pub, Lapworth Gold, brewed in Coventry. 
We will say this though, that it was very pleasant sitting outdoors, rather than inside, which we feel is just a very basic pub, and it looks better from the road than indoors (photo 9). 
Our final thoughts. 
We chose this pub because of the historic Lapworth link, it’s not often you will find a circular walk between two different canals, so although The Navigation didn’t inspire us it was interesting enough a short break. We did not need toilets, so failed to report for you, but we cannot imagine a separate disabled toilet here, it’s not a big enough pub. For a short visit as you tour around, we feel you may manage this little pub and think we can recommend a visit for you."
365,"The V and A has two step free entrances in Cromwell Road and Exhibition Road. I entered from Cromwell Road and there is a gradual slope as well as steps to the entrance. There was a revolving door and an accessible entrance next to it. When I arrived I got  manual wheelchair from a number which are near to the entrance. 
On my visit I stayed on the ground floor visiting the Frida Kahlo exhibition and restaurant. The entire route was step free. Getting to the exhibition involved going through the gift shop, the aisles were wide enough but it was busy. 
The Frida Kahlo exhibition was very popular and sold out on the day we visited. The exhibition focuses on her as a person and her image with a collection of personal artefacts and clothing. There is only a small display of her art work.
We had timed admission and there was no queue when we arrived. The exhibition was laid out in a series of rooms. The first was a long, straight corridor with paintings and photographs on both sides of the walls. The exhibits were at standing height but the labels were at a lower level which was perfect for me in a wheelchair. The other rooms had items on the walls plus display cabinets which were at wheelchair user height. I'm glad I used a wheelchair to get around as there was no fixed seating inside the exhibition.
Frida Kahlo was a disabled artist and one of the rooms focuses on her health and disability. On display is her prosthetic leg, decorated corsets which she wore after her operations and an assortment of medication. There are several photos that includes Frida's wheelchair. Interestingly when I was in this room people were very aware of my wheelchair and proactive about moving to let me see the exhibits, while in the other rooms both before and after I was often invisible. 
At the exit there are manual doors but a member of the public was there and opened the door for me.
Exiting via the gift shop there were two unmarked slopes, both of which caught me by surprise and I nearly needed up rolling into members of the public. 
The café is self service with free standing tables and chairs. It was busy when we visited."
366,Has fully accessible disabled toilets.
367,"The venue is level from the door in there is a large lift located just in front of the door if you want to go upstairs .  We did not use this area during this visit. 
There was room to move around in wheelchair to access area we wanted to go during our visit ."
368,"Disabeld access is good overall with ramps up to the main doors. However, I was surprised to find that the main doors had automatic door opening buttons but when I pressed these they did not work. Instead the automatic doors had been replaced with  standard manual doors with quite strong return arms on them, not easy when your in a wheelchair. This said I found the rest of the museum was widely accessible and managed to get to every one of the exhibits that I wanted to see."
369,"There are buses & taxi ranks nearby, but accessible tube stations are lacking."
370,Generally disabled access is very good. Automated doors for wheelchair access. Great toilets. Very helpful staff.
371,"Good effort with the toilets, could be a little cleaner."
372,"Access in and around the building:

The building has a prominent entrance. The reception was bright and light with good signage. There was a hearing loop which was indicated by a prominent sign.

The lift had good contrasting controls and braille buttons. The doors to the bedrooms had good signage.

Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:

The accessible bedrooms were bright and spacious. The bathrooms were well lit. The rooms had a large button telephone.

The fire alarms in the rooms had the usual audio sounder but were also equipped with flashing lights. Vibrating alters for pillow were also available for hearing impaired guests.

Access in the dining area:

The dining area was large and well laid out.

Access to other facilities:

The hotel also had a bar and lounge area."
373,Some of our group arrived by car and were able to park adjacent to the building in the accessible parking bays. I and my companion arrived by Tram which was super accessible for me as a powerchair user.
374,"Fantastic Changing Places Facility.  You need to ask for the code to get in, but it’s beautifully clean and well equipped.  "
375,There is a big step at the entrance. The shop has no wheelchair ramp. I was unable to get inside. Zero stars.
376,"We visited Chester's Fort because it is an English Heritage site and we are members. With hindsight, some of the other Hadrian's Wall attractions are probably better for wheelchair access. We had a lovely visit but I was very limited in what I could access."
377,"Brilliant, absolutely accessible and friendly"
378,Staff were very friendly and welcoming.
379,Parking is next to the house with tiled surface all the way to the front door.
380,"There is a level access door but this is usually locked so bring a friend. The food was delicious and this warm, dog friendly pub has a good atmosphere and lovely staff.

I did not explore whether there is an accessible toilet on my visit so please take this into account."
381,"From the front it looks really small, but there's a big space around the back, where the drinking water is also kept. Though there's two steps down to that area. You can sit outside and a bit instead the building that is all on one level (though everywhere is roofed!). 
Wide spaces between tables."
382,"Difficult for disabled people due to the sheer numbers of people congregated at the entrance to Edinburgh Castle, then the rush once we were let in."
383,"The Beacon shopping centre houses Eastbourne’s largest collection of retail outlets under one roof. With an integral multi-storey car park the Beacon has three floors of shops, cafes, restaurants and a multiplex cinema all providing level access for the less able. Shopmobility is a mobility scooter, powerchair and class 1 wheelchair hire facility immediately outside the rear entrance at the eastern end of the centre and alongside the centrally situated accessible toilets is a Changing Place toilet facility.  "
384,Fantastic hosts and staff - nothing is too much trouble.
385,All the staff we met were very helpful!
386,We researched the place before our visit to ensure there was wheelchair  Access.  There is ample car parking for a fee.  There is a map illustrating different routes around the park but no actual markers along the paths.   The views and trees are stunning but the paths are gravelled and there are plenty  of undulations not ideal for a chaired person.  It was hard work wheeling and pushing.  We prefer nearby Bradgate Park with its tarmac pathways .  
387,A small ramp at the entrance but otherwise fully accessible
388,"Opposite the shop, well equipped, spacious."
389,Nearby parking.
390,"The main theatre is fully accessible, with a lift to the upper floor - and staff will take out seat(s) downstairs if required."
391,"You would need to drive as quite a remote area, no direct public transport."
392,"Although rushed  off their feet, staff did their best to make our evening enjoyable..  Most had good English and helped with seats etc."
393,"There are no steps throughout the whole park, all the ground was even and if you needed any help at any point you know there is plenty of staff around."
394,Helpful staff. First front desk waitron did not know the accessible entrance information but called over another staff member who was very helpful. 
395,"There are 3 disabled bays (free) to the side of the venue and a paid, covered, parking facility in the same location. "
396,If you want to help or even if your starting up a Vouluntry group they can help 
397,"Caring and thoughtful, all very helpful without being over the top - all you would wish."
398,"The Main Bedroom with en-suite wet-room (probably the best I can recall, always hot water, surfaces to accommodate toiletries etc. (a major fault I find in holiday wet rooms)"
399,There is a single width lift ....no use for large motorised chairs or scooters
400,Apart from checking tickets I didn't interact with the staff. There was no interval for the performance.
401,"Beautiful forest scenery takes you to the starting point, sometimes along busy roads, but it’s also quiet on some, and you cannot miss the sign to say you have arrived.
There are three disabled bays available just yards after arriving, but if full, the main free car park is just a few more yards away."
402,"No hoist, standard disabled loo but you'll have to fight the healthies for the loo at break time as they don't want to wait for the normal toilets"
403,"The centre itself is a bit off the beaten track, so a walk if arriving by foot.  However there is a large car park with plenty of disabled bays available."
404,"Appalling: broken seat, red cord only reaching part way to the ground and no flush arm visible. "
405,"There are 4 Christmas Markets in Edinburgh in 4 locations pretty much within what’s known as ‘ the square mile ‘. They are all varied but based on the same Christmas theme, this site is West George Street from. Castle Street, westwards to Charlotte Square, where both sides of the road have been pedestrianised, no parking or bus facilities in this area though you are surrounded by nearby vehicular Access. This is dominated by a light show which is at roof top height and a also at foot andStreet level. Whilst there are some retail stalls, the main focus is on the bars, restaurants and clubs who have outdoor areas in the pedestrianised area. There are craft, jewellery, art and written goods available with winter clothing.  There is good temporary flooring in place rather than uneven, cracked paving and pot holes, but it can  be slippery in the wet. There is ample access for chairs and power scooters throughout the area that areramped. Toilet facilities are via the providers I mentioned earlier, did not use them so can not comment. Access is from either Castle Street, Rose Street that runs parallel with George Street and via Charlotte Square. As there is no traffic you can utilise the road areas, it’s busy but not congested. It is staffed by the same event company and they are particularly helpful."
406,"We went to hear Sharon Van Etten last night - the venue was standing on the ground floor and open seating on the balcony, which is up 33 steps. No lift.  The ground floor is flat access from the street but there’s nothing to help you see over the standing crowd if you’re sitting down, as was mentioned in the other review.  Festival staff were polite but unable to help with access in any way.  I gave it two stars because I surprised myself with being able to climb and descend 33 steps!  I hope future work on the venue includes provision for people who can’t climb stairs or stand through an entire gig."
407,We have been here before and always enjoy our stay. We have 2 dogs one of which is my assistance dog. The lodge is very comfortable and spacious. The lodge sleeps 8 to 10 people and is dog friendly. There are also profiling beds in the lodge which helps me to sleep better. Lots to do in the local area. The seated exercise class on a Wednesday morning is great fun in the Paxton Centre.
408,"Set in a modern building, the hotel offers accessible rooms, food and beverages, as well as a friendly welcome. Its location in the heart of the city made for easy access to everywhere we wanted to visit. 

A ten minute walk to the river side, five minutes to the main shopping area, and five minutes to the Victorian Market made for a great time."
409,"US Capitol  is one of the most iconic buildings in Washington DC. I would say it’s a must see. Entrance was free. Once we got through security ( for prohibited 🚫 items see https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/plan-visit/prohibited-items )’we made our way to the tour (45 mins long). I would suggest that you pre-book your place on a tour on the Capitol Hill website to avoid queuing ( https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/plan-visit/book-tour-capitol). The tour was packed with information about the history of the building and the congress.
After the tour we spent 45 mins !!!!! queuing to go into the senate gallery ( https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/plan-visit/watching-congress-session). I am not sure it was worth the wait.
We then had a quick snack in the large cafeteria that had a selection of basic hot/cold/sweet and savoury food.
Overall I would say the building was extremely accessible and I would definitely recommend visiting it. More details about accessibility to follow."
410,"The National Memorial Arboretum, not been in my chair before, I would hope they are geared up for me! As they deal with many veterans and amputees don't they.  Yes I was right and all was well.  First thing to do was go on the Land Train  that runs round the site.  This was good as there was a commentary on the memorials we passed, I managed to hear most of it too.  The best bit of it was I could stay in my chair as I was just wheeled aboard.
Following on from the train was to walked about a bit (you know what I mean) the paths are really smooth and wide, although there are some memorial which require off road skills.  At one point there were steps but a smooth slope was adjacent to it.  There are also plenty of benches for pushers to rest.  Not sure how I would get up to the memorial wall,  As it threatened rain and we went in for coffee and cake.  However whilst on the train I did see a wheelchair being pushed up a spiral path but it looked like hard work and I am not sure Mom would be up to that.  Before leaving I checked out the shop which was easy to negotiate and the disabled loo which was fine and one of the best layouts visited yet"
411,"Access into the entrance is on the level, and you reach the reception desk, but this has steps down into the booking in area of reception, but willing staff came to help us. Just across from reception is the beautifully decorated George’s Bar, and you really must go in and enjoy the views and a welcomed drink, but sadly, there are steps you have to go down to benefit the lounge area. You have a choice now, of sitting by the bar itself, which is on the level before the steps down into bar lounge, 
or you can go outside again, along to the ramp of the terrace patio, and back across to the doorway, with a pull handle, and get into the main lounge which is now all on the level for you. A bit of a nuisance if it’s raining, but it is such a lovely lounge.
If you now want to enjoy looking around the Abbey, or taking afternoon tea, or using the bathroom, you will need to go outside again, across the terrace and up the ramp and back to reception area, where the Abbey and all its holds is yours.  Do try to spend some time wandering along many corridors with amazing rooms to see, it’s on the level for you, so have a go, just encourage your carer to keep going, it’s a beautiful Abbey, so do not miss out."
412,Didn't use the accessible loo so can't make further comment on it other than it was at least located at a good position next to the access door.
413,"There is inbuilt ramp to get it, the doorway is not especially wide so larger wheelchairs may struggle. There is a lowered counter to pay, it’s table service which is helpful, and the tables are a good height. One time I went and there weren’t any of the ‘normal’ tables and just a booth but the staff were helpful and said it was ok to get out of my chair and have it sitting in the isle so I could sit in the booth. It s quite a busy cafe so getting a table on weekends is hard if you don’t book. "
414,"All generally unclean, and of the porta cabin variety.  Disabled facilities, shared with baby change so queues, impatient people  a problem.  No disabled changing."
415,"Such attention to detail was shown by all staff we met - and so helpful but not at all intrusive. After my 1st night, I mentioned that there was no reading light in my bedroom - I had an excellent contemporary lamp the following evening!"
416,There is a small patch of rather rough ground next to the visitor centre which is labelled for disabled parking.
417,"People were cooperative with deafness, using notepads and pens for communication."
418,To get in there is one glass door that opens inwards. Turn right and you will be seated by staff. When entering a chair was moved from a table instantly and everything was smooth. One star off just because of the door being heavy I could not open this independently.
419,"I had such a great night here! The food was amazing, great service and zero accessibility issues, I just wish I got better photos! The atmosphere was relaxed, the smells were amazing, the service was really good. I can’t eat much and have a feeding tube, there was nothing I’d be able to eat from the starters so I asked for a main meal of chicken and roast potatoes as a starter- very small, no veg or salad etc, they provided this at half the normal price. I really appreciated the chef doing this, the plate still looked amazing and I felt like I was able to ‘participate’ more in dinner  with my friends."
420,Level access into shop with automatic doors. Seating available near till. Hearing loop sign spotted. Shelves were high. Didn't see a designated accessible till. Wheelchair accessible trolley available. 
421,"There are 3 parking spaces outside of the gym, they aren't disabled parking spaces but if you exit from the back of your vehicle it would be okay. The owner said to me if my beautician mentions to her that I am coming she will put a cone out so there is a space available for me.

I'm not from this area so I don't know much about the public transport but the beauticians is located on the main street of Invergowrie so I think there will be bus stops nearby."
422,"The staff in the restaurant in particular were all charming and happy to assist with anything they could from moving a chair out of the way to make room for a wheelchair, to carrying the tray over to the table. They went out of their way to make sure we had anything we needed and I was deeply grateful to them."
423,"National Trust volunteers provide buggy rides for the less able, but book in advance."
424,"Could not be better, outside the front door and on smooth tarmac."
425,"Access across the railway at Westerton Train Station used to be via a narrow pedestrian bridge making it very difficult for anyone with impaired mobility to access both platforms.

The old bridge was replaced in 2018 by a new wider bridge and lifts have been installed making it easier for all passengers to cross the railway to the opposite platform."
426,Very helpful staff that are ready to open doors and answer your questions with out any qualms.
427,"All staff that I spoke to during my visit to Sleeperz were very friendly and helpful. Due to not staying over I didn’t have the usual enquiries that I do in other hotels. I did speak to the General Manager about the need for a hoist and he said he would look into it, which is always a positive thing."
428,"There are 8 or 9 disabled bays outside the Cinema, however they are nearly always full and for a large complex with a bowling alley and numerous restaurants the proportion of disabled bays is not working."
429,"Disabled loo clearly marked and staff showed where lifts and loo were when getting off the carriage, I say getting off but it was totally level access for the disabled seats. Very clean,roomy,with good rails."
430,"Our first visit, everything thing was just right. Cottage with everything we needed including the hot tub :-)
Even the weather was kind to us. We shall certainly be going again. Thank you everyone at Brickhouse Cottages."
431,We came as pedestrians. Parking likely tricky given it's on a busy road but there are lots of buses running up North Bridge.
432,There are disabled toilets and it was easy to get there 
433,"It’s a compressed soil area, with wide paths, and a lot can be seen, but at New Fancy it’s not really disabled friendly, as too hilly, but worth going to see for a quick visit.
A short drive away you will arrive at Mallards Pike, a beauty spot, again with wide compressed soil parking area and paths. This site is a little more hilly than others, but you can cope. After paying £2.00 for parking ticket, a number of walks can be taken, your carer should manage quite well for you. Seating is available to enjoy views,  but cafe will be closed over winter."
434,Disabled access is fantastic the security lane for disabled people is separate. They are lifts inside both Victoria station and Manchester arena that are easily accessible. Disabled viewing platforms are available in each block with security present to assist if needed. Singage Through the venue was clear. 
435,Easily accessible location for wheelchair users
436,The staff member who answered the phone to me came straight down to give access. At every opportunity they offered help and support which is great. 
437,Plenty of rails and room.
438,"Good clean loo, situated in the bar. Red cord was tied up but otherwise very clean, good quality soap and handcream, very stylish."
439,There are large accessible toilets in the booking hall. Staff will help with directions as they are tucked away around a corner.
440,Friendly and showed us a map. I think we could have navigated the one room without the pre talk on how to see the exhibits.
441,The keypad entry has small keys and there is no raised line on the 5 for those with visual impairments. You can get a fob which makes things easier but they cost £6. The door is electronic but it opens really quick so it hits the front of my chair. The water fountains are not at an accessible height and the sign for toilets points to the stairs not the lift. There is a lift to all floors but the doors are manual and you have to keep holding the button down to get it to work. There are no machines that can be used directly from a wheelchair other than free weights and majority of the machines are awkward transfers as well There is no braille signs. They do require those with access needs to have a Personal Evacuation Plan. There are help points with large print signs. The help point has braille label. 
442,"parking is tricky.there are buses which pick up some of the clients who use the facilities. on the whole,the disabled facilities are very good"
443,"The toilets are roomy, clean and easy to access."
444,Access through main doors and rear access to rooms.
445,"Staff are excellent at physically helping if you want e.g. with carrying drinks, guiding a blind folk, operating lifts, reserving seats together in the cinema, if you come as a group, etc.
I'd describe the staff as helpful, cheerful, respectful. They are very disability aware and are well trained. The wheelchair space booking system on their computers seems to be very clunky - not the staff's fault."
446,This is the killer. The toilets are down a staircase below the stage. Absolute disaster for the disabled. There's a disabled loo in the locked church opposite & you might try George & Davis ice-cream over the road for a loo.
447,there is a disabled toilet next to the ticket office you have to ask staff for the key.
448,"The station staff were all very helpful, the staff in the booking office particularly so."
449,"Lift to all levels, Electric doors with low level push button"
450,This is an old listed building however there is a small lift on the outside of the building for step free access and on the inside there are plenty lifts to take you throughout the building. There are a number of toilets and the staff were extremely helpful.
451,Disabled toilet on site access a little bit tight but  possible
452,Staff were very friendly and helpful.
453,"Their is a car park within the venue, its on a major road just behind the Glasgow Fort"
454,"Inside the venue, I couldn't fault the access. My only gripe was the heavy double entrance doors for my hubbie to push me through. However the jolly and plentiful stewards were quick to react and help him.  Flooring is smooth to wheel on.  All wheelchair spaces were at entrance level as were the loos and food/drink outlets (which were great as well). I got a fantastic view - the row in front was sufficiently low as not to impede my view even when they stood up.  Whole track is easy to see."
455,"Spacious and very well-equipped, with a wide door. Easy to get to from the dining areas."
456,"Staff were all friendly, very welcoming & helpful. "
457,"The staff were helpful and informative, and opened more suitable ways in for me on my scooter when things got a bit tight around the entrance/shop area."
458,Very good apart from the havy fire doors
459,There are disabled parking spaces from the side entrance to the station. Low-level and high level trains can be accessed via a ramp which can be booked with Scotrail Passenger Assistance. 
460,We have always found the staff friendly and efficient.
461,"I took the wheelchair taxi, but public buses will stop here, and large car park with several dedicated accessible spaces"
462,"Assist staff are excellent. They have set area's for wheelchairs, stand alone  chairs if you need more room for whatever reason. Access to a disabled toilet. The member of staff helping me checked on me regularly to make sure I was comfortable, was there anything she could get me etc. I was treated very well and it made the whole evening a very enjoyable experience. There is a number to phone to arrange and more information on their website about what is available."
463,North Berwick is notorious for lack of parking. You will have to park on street parking. You will have to park in the main car park opposite the ship inn  there are blue badge spaces. Walk on to the street turn right and signals is one hundred meters .
464,"The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful and really went the extra mile to help me out despite my 'special needs' (!), for instance bringing me out a chair while I was waiting in the queue. They also replied to my Facebook queries about accessibility very quickly with really useful information, and an unprompted offer to reserve me a table for the gig. Lovely people."
465,"Many buses serve this store so it's easy to get here, there are very large car parks too so it won't be a problem getting a space here."
466,I met up with some friends for coffee at the lounge bar of the DoubleTree Hilton hotel in Edinburgh city centre. This venue has the Neatebox app Welcome installed so I was able to let them know in advance that I was coming and what assistance requirements I need. As soon as I arrived I was greeted at the entrance by Ricardo who guided me through to the lounge bar where I met up with friends for a coffee and blether. 
467,"level access , automatic doors , wide foyer , no doors into the public areas , including the restaurant. Ample lifts with good space inside so no problems for wheel chairs getting to all floors.
The accessible bedroom I stayed in had a working automatic door which enabled easy departure from the room and unlike most hotels with automatic doors , the mechanism was in good working order. The only issue was that the door was only automatic from inside the room , not on entry and overcoming the inertia  to push the door open was difficult. Getting out was a breeze
Roomy entrance to bathroom and plenty of space for transfers both in bathroom and bedroom."
468,"There is an accessible loo near the cafe and another at the bird of prey centre, both of which are really spacious with plenty of grab rails. "
469,Great loo - very spacious!
470,"Parking was near the facility and easy to use, there were spaces"
471,Lots of disabled parking in front of the building 
472,Complete step free access throughout. 
473,No specific wheelchair parking and the car park was a bit bumpy and pot holey.
474,Staff raced out with a ramp which gave access to all restaurant
475,"Long gently sloping ramp to entrance but uneven slabs making progress difficult for wheelchair. Inside lobby wheelchair lift to raise approx 3 feet to Restaurant. Assisted by reception staff whether I wanted it or not. When up to restaurant level gate opened and switch/lock mechanism fell off. When challenged, staff said it wasn't actually ""broken"" it had ""just fallen off"" and it had been like that for some time. It was then pushed back into place to prove that! It fell off again when going back down later.
Floors in restaurant flat but not level (it is a historic building)."
476,There were accessible toilets which were very well located.
477,We drove in our car. The website details where the on road blue badge parking is and it is quite close to venue. Not lots of blue badges spaces but we got parked easily. 
478,Friendly staff.
479,From the train to the station concourse is fairly straigforward once you locate the lift. It's tucked away at the end of the platform along its own corridor. The lift itself is large and has plenty of turning space. Once on ground level there's a clearly marked route to the barriers where one is wide enough for wheelchair access. One route out of the station from the Jubilee Line is level.
480,We used the jubilee line so it was easy to get to this station. Not sure what the access is like for for the district & circle lines?
481,"Lots of space in the Loo plenty of room to maneuver a powered wheelchair. Everything in the one room a wash hand basin, toilet, shower and a bath also a commode shower chair. Still room for a power-chair and a portable hoist if needed. Photos on the website will show the layout of the room. A standard toilet with drop-down bars, also a toilet raiser so all sizes catered for with the commode shower chair going over the toilet."
482,"Signage was minimal, there was no seating to rest on, from the parking to the venue.  Access to the food festival was off the main path, onto and then across the grass which was muddy in places.  Difficult with a walking frame.  No matting to make it accessible for difficult at best. Site of the festival itself is on a slope and very muddy, again with no matting in the area's of heavy footfall."
483,Good sized accessible toilet.
484,Big toliets with grab rails wet rooms in disabled rooms with seat
485,"Everyone we meet during our time in the village were doing the work voluntary were very helpful and wanted to tell you about the village etc 
  
"
486,We were met by Kim on arrival who was extremely friendly and helpful.  All staff we met during our stay were exceptional -a real asset. 
487,"Wheelchairs could get into the castle but dont expect to get very far once in. If your able to walk, you will probably have a good time."
488,Always friendly and polite.
489,Friendly and helpful. One staff member saw us heading for the accessible toilet and rushed across to open the doors for us.
490,"Flat surface and level access entrance into the store. There is a revolving door with a wheelchair button, which I think slows down the turning of the door. I've never had to do this as the door doesn't revolve very fast anyway. There is also a wheelchair accessible door on the left which has a large push button to automatically open the door.

There is a large lift to take you up to the showroom, but there is also a wide door to take you through to the markethall if you don't want to go through the showroom. Lots of space to move around."
491,"There's plenty of disabled parking close to the entrance and there is no height restriction meaning that large WAVs and Minibuses can use it too, which is handy as it is situated next to the Eastgate Shopping Centre but it's worth noting that there is a 3 hour maximum time limit."
492,"Excellent in every way: good lifts (when they're working, which is usually), good staff, easy access all areas."
493,"Level access, automatic electric doors.

Wheelchair accessible trolleys are located inside. Mobility scooters & manual wheelchairs available.  They also have the small metal baskets.

Hearing loops were available according to signs. 

I didn't see any designated accessible tills. Not much space at scan and go tills. 

The shelving and fridges/freezers were typical of supermarkets and difficult to access. The scales for fruit and veg was really high. 

No music but they do have a tannoy system.

The lift to up stairs is at back of store inside the Argos. "
494,There was a proper disabled toilet at the hovercraft report on the Isle of Wight
495,Staff are always very friendly in Mimi's and will offer you a very warm welcome.
496,There was some lovely scenery on the walk. 
497,"Despite the obvious limitations of an old building, access was quite straightforward and staff were lovely.  My transfer seat had a great view of the stage."
498,"Level and very smooth access, plenty of shops, disabled toilets, lifts. Always clean.  Can be  a little busy at weekends. Plenty of places to eat. Feels safe to shop. Long opening hours. Would recommend."
499,Really friendly and helpful. Thanks! 
500,"Chemist treatment room is too small for wheelchair.

Didn't see any manual wheelchairs or accessible trolleys."
501,In general staff are helpful and pleasant.
502,"Clear signposting
Flat access
Automatic doors
Plenty of room for wheelchairs to manoevere in reception and clinical areas
Wheelchair height area at reception desk
Facilities for hearing impaired clients
Walking distance not too far for mobility impaired, but wheelchairs to assist available just inside entrance,
 seating close to entrance, and reasonable height seating all with arm rests
Dedicated safe play area for children next to reception with full  observation , and key code to access area"
503,"Four star water front hotel opposite Torquay railway station.  Overall in the communal areas there is very good accessibility ramps, accessible public spaces and accessible toilet on ground floor, 2 lifts. The hotel has 132 rooms and their website states ""The Grand has one bedroom with fully-equipped wet room, fitted with grab rails around the bathroom and it is situated on the ground floor.  A shower stool can be provided for use in this room."""
504,Nearest tube is Greenwich
505,"This was very problematic. Firstly the accessible toilet is not sign posted. It is in a corridor behind a door marked staff only. One of my own colleague told me off for going into an area marked staff only, see photo. When I went through this door I found that a trolley was blocking the accessible toilet. This happened twice during my stay. When I went into the toilet for the first time there was a stair climber wheelchair, which took up most of the space in the toilet, I was told this was there as it had been used the day before. I explained that the accessible toilet should not be used as a store room.  This was removed before my second loo break. The toilet had grab rails and was clean. The emergency cord didn't reach to the ground. "
506,"The staff were very friendly and helpful. They gave us the closest table which was easy to use, they took chairs away without needing instructed. Good experience!"
507,"This museum is located in the old White Star Line building in Cobh (formerly Queenstown), which is where people would have bought their tickets for a journey on the company's liners. Cobh/Queenstown was the Titanic's last stop before the ship came to grief in the mid-Atlantic, and the museum focuses particularly on the Irish passengers who boarded there. At the beginning, you are given a 'boarding pass' with one of the real Queenstown passengers' names on it, and after you have worked your way through the various video presentations, recreations of Titanic cabins and displays of artefacts, you find out whether the passenger on your boarding pass survived the sinking.

As a wheelchair/scooter using visitor, I felt able to join in with all parts of the experience at the museum. There's a wheelchair lift to get into the building which you can operate yourself (unlike some places where you have to send in a person who can climb stairs to ask for help, which isn't really proper access). When you get inside, it's sometimes a little tight around the corners, but given the importance of housing the museum in the historic setting of the White Star Line museum, I felt that a good job had been done in making the access as good as possible."
508,"You can walk around two of the pond areas at Monikie and both pathways are layered with grass. The pathways vary in width as you walk around and in certain areas there are stones within the ground that can cause the pathway to be quite bumpy. There is a gradient hill at either side of the pathway so it might be difficult for wheelchair users that aren’t very confident with their driving. When I walk past the ponds I always feel more comfortable going to the left as I feel that pathway is better, and it’s a shorter walk for the colder days.

Before or after your walk, there are two grassy areas to enjoy a sit down, picnic or BBQ. These are all flat areas and very spacious. If your lucky you might even be joined by the ducks that live in Monikie Country Park.

The ground in the childrens play parks is mainly covered in bark which can be quite difficult for wheelchair users to drive on. There is a pathway going around the pay equipment but, you can’t get close to any of it. Between the two play parks at Monikie there is a small wooden bridge to go over which I feel would be hard to drive on as there are wooden ridges at the start and end of the bridge. I just feel the combination of driving on a gradient and over the ridges would be difficult.

There is also a café/restaurant on the grounds of Monikie Country Park called …, which I will review separately another time."
509,"On the University of Leeds campus just outside the city centre, in the Student's Union, Old Bar is a great accessible pub!

Obviously full of students, but lecturers and visitors too, Old Bar has a great atmosphere whenever you go. 
They have a wide range of food and drinks, with a varied menu that caters for vegetarians, vegans, lactose and gluten intolerances. 

There is a pool table and they have various TV screens that show the news or sports, with additional screens that come down to project bigger matches too. They have a pub quiz every Thursday, with other events such as gigs every so often. 
This does mean that it can be quite busy on Fridays and Saturdays, and the noise levels may be problematic for some people. 

There is a lift down to Old Bar as well as step free access around the side. There is an accessible toilet as well as gender neutral toilets if required. "
510,"Excellent modern accommodation finished to the highest of standards, with wonderful views over the open country side. Warm welcome and great full English breakfast. Would have stayed longer but no vacancy. No hesitation in recommending, whether able bodied or not."
511,Plenty of disabled parking with level access to main entrance.  Automatic doors
512,"The bathroom was very disappointing and clearly a token effort.  I knew before we arrived there was going to be a bath instead of a shower.  Not great but I was only staying 1 night.  The toilet was extremely low (even my dad commented how low it was), thankfully I had asked for the height when booking and brought my own seat riser (they don’t supply such a thing), even with that it was hard work.  The hand rails were badly located, the drop down one even when down was too far back to be of use.

The sink was lower down, but as it was boxed in there was no room for knees underneath.  They had also opted for two taps instead of a mixer one. Such a scolding issue.

Unfortunately they had decided not to put a carpet bar on, so the join between the bathroom tiles and room carpet had a raw edge that I got my foot caught in each time.

The floor files also got very slippy when wet, I couldn’t get off the toilet when we first arrived as my feet kept sliding. 

There was no disabled toilet upstairs at the function suite as no access.  However there was one in the foyer of the hotel, but I never used it."
513,"All staff that I encountered during my visit were very friendly and helpful. They made sure I knew which areas weren’t accessible and they always greeted you when you walked past them during the walk.

The only issue I had, and I don’t even know if you can count this as staff, but I struggled to get in touch with the organisers of the event by multiple emails to get my free carer ticket. Their office was only open I think 3 days during the week and I had to eventually phone them on the day I was attending the event and it got sorted. But it was very stressful as up until the day I didn’t know if I would be able to go."
514,"Staff where friendly and helpful.
Though I was with my carer the staff in the café where happy to get items for me in the café.
Café staff where also helpful when I asked about allergies.
Around there store however there was no staff around to help e.g. to point out how inaccessible the layout of the shop was or to ask to help find items."
515,Very helpful and friendly. Nothing too much trouble
516,bus stops nearby
517,"Toilet was huge, had a hoist, changing bed and height adjustable sink. Toilet flush wasnt great. Lots of space for a carer- you could fit a whole family in there!"
518,"I wouldn't call it accessible, but they've done what they can - a dozen or so steps down, then a 90 degree turn and a few more steps down to the door to the loos (and another area with further tables).

On the way down the stairs you can check out some of the goods for sale - i picked up a lovely Moroccan bowl.

Stairs are metal with a textured surface which helps your feet grip. Chunky banister right down - poss. both sides? Definitely on left though.

The accessible loo itself had plenty of room for me - although of course I'd had to leave the scooter upstairs!"
519,Everyone we met on the bus journeys was helpful and friendly.
520,Parking next to disabled accommodation
521,Paved path to barn. No steps. Low threshold that wheelchair could be taken over. Space to move about in main area and surfaces made moving easy (in a wheelchair).
522,"It was easy to wheel into the park from the street. The main paths are hard surfaced and fairly level; as well as being in good condition. It was fairly easy to wheel on to the grass areas and have a look around.

There are dedicated areas within the park such as the children's play area and the football area."
523,No designated car park but you can park on the street outside the cafe and there are many buses stopping nearby.
524,Red cord had been replaced with string and had been knotted so it could not reach the ground. Two bins by the entrance. Was pretty dirty even for festival standards :) Ridiculous signage - door was covered with flyers so you could barely make out where it is.
525,Friendly and extremely helpful.
526,All the equipment you could need supplied and thoughtfully laid out shower room and toilets
527,Good size toilet access could be better but right across from Costa in shopping centire is an excellent rader key toilet good size good access very pleased.
528,"All of the staff we dealt with were very pleasant, helpful and willing."
529,Their is a disabiled toilet just outside of the main room what is really good 
530,"Excellent! All areas accessible and I could see everything I wanted. There are one or two tanks that you can actually climb into but I couldn't get into those but all the others were laid out with plenty of room to wheel around them. 
We didn't go outside on our visit due to the weather so can't comment on the accessibility of the outside unfortunately."
531,You enter the shop through level access however the entrance door is pretty tight but once you are past the entrance then the shop has normal garden centre products and a lovely wee coffee which I would definitely recommend.
532,"Access on one level if entering from the main street, to access the bar would need to use entrance on Lochrin Place as a few steps up from the bar from the main entrance."
533,We got their via DLR and Underground from Greenwich. Got off at South Kensington and walked for about seven minutes through the covered walkway and through the museums underground entrance. The exhibition was about a three minute walk away.
534,Managed to get round the garden but that was all. 
535,"There are 22 reserved parking spaces for disabled customers.

There is free use of wheelchairs offered for the period of your duration at the shopping centre. Mobility scooters are also available, as the centre works in partnership with Travel Extra Mobility Service. For more information about the hiring, there is information on the website https://www.ststephens-hull.com/  "
536,Staff are great. They go out of their way to ensure you have a great day.
537,"It’s all woodland, so expect a little huffing and puffing, but on a dry day, you may get around quite easily, it depends on the strength of your carer. We did not see any benches for a rest, so bear this in mind as to the distance you want carer to push."
538,"Space is provided adjacent to the toilet in the cabin for easy transfer from wheelchair. However, as someone over 6 foot tall, the hand rails are a bit low and there is no high level support for someone standing upright.

(There are other accessible toilets around the ferry, however I've never needed to try them ...)"
539,"I didnt find any accessible toilets. On the ground floor there are regular toilets. 

In my room although there was no toilet grab rail I was able to easily use the vanity unit to help me up.
"
540,Flat access throughout accommodation including onto large terrace from 2 patio doors
541,"As mentioned, the disabled are treated like royalty in this cruise terminal and nothing is too much for the superb staff to handle."
542,"Disabled access to the tents was good but not sure about any of the rides as i didn't go on any.Make sure you get a table or you can't buy any food or drink ,areas set aside for wheelchair users but they get busy early."
543,Across the road from Haymarket Station and on several bus routes.
544,"There was a space marked with a Blue Badge symbol near the archway that leads to the hotel and there is ample parking generally. The car park was gravel which could have been a problem, but we were able to park near enough to the pathway to be able to get straight onto it."
545,Vikingar is my local lesuire centre. There are swimming and gym facilities available I have recently been attending a low circuit fitness class which is mostly seated. Staff are very helpful and will work with you on a fitness programme that suits your needs There are accessible changing rooms and the pool can be accessed using a hoist.
546,"We stayed in Pinder cottage, though Hoe Grange has a range of cottages with different levels of access. Not only is there excellent access but also equipment to borrow if needed."
547,"Extremely attentive and efficient, esp with a noisy lively group "
548,"There are lifts and several bathrooms specifically designed for people with physical disabilities, making it a comfortable environment. "
549,"Lovely welcome from every volunteer that we encountered, offers of help without needing to ask."
550,"We accessed the beach via a path accessed around the side of the houses beside the lighthouse and carpark.
No signage, it was a local resident who approached me and kindly showed me how to access the path, which he said had recently been resurfaced
Path not tarmac, and a bit bumpy  and uneven in places.
Level access to picnic area
Seating at picnic area"
551,"There is one accessible toilet on the first floor located next to the lifts. there is room for a carer to assist in this area if required. Access is via 2 doors. 
There was a red cord in this toilet but was tied up Red Cord card left"
552,All the staff were very helpful and knowledgeable. The role-play element of the main tour was particularly engaging.
553,The parking was limited. There was a car park around side too. The accessible bays appear wider but aren't very well marked. 
554,"The waitress we had was lovely, friendly and very accommodating. "
555,"It's on George's Street in city centre, so not much parking but lots of transport options"
556,One one level both inside the restaurant and it’s outside seating area.
557,The pub is very close to the railway station and has one disabled space next to the rear entrance. 
558,Very friendly staff
559,"There is a ramp up to the entrance. Doors are electric and open automatically. Throughout there are labelled accessible routes which are ramps. Lights are bright. Induction loops available. 

Library: there are lowered desks for computers with large print keyboards. Books are shelved at a decent height. Large print and audio books available. There is lowered counter at reception. 

Council house: lowered check in counter, phone & self payment machine. Did not see lowered computer though for accessing information. Chairs available throughout. "
560,Friendly and informative
561,"This was the hotel found for us by the staff at our first (completely inappropriate) hotel, the Court House Hotel.  It was very easy to find, being just off the ring road, and close to the main train station.  Being just outside the old town, it is a new building that is fully accessible, and has free onsite parking directly outside the door.
The reception is accessible step-free.  Lots of chairs to sit in while waiting.  Lifts to all floors which were big enough for my mobility scooter.
Our room was not large, but there was plenty of space for my mobility scooter, wheelchair and our luggage.  The double bed was two singles joined together - very, very comfortable.
Nice, varied breakfast with hot and cold items.  There was an in-house restaurant, with very standard fare.  We did not eat there as there were so many good restaurants nearby.
The hotel is only a short distance by mobility scooter to the Old Town with the Oude Gracht, Vredenburg Place (markets on Friday and Saturday)  and a multitude of very good restaurants.  Ask at reception for the short cut through a foot tunnel.  
Utrecht is a really lovely city - even in the continual drizzle that met our visit.  The roads and footpaths are mostly flat enough for a comfortable ride on wheelchair or mobility scooter.  Few cars around, but millions of bicycles everywhere.  May cause problems for blind visitors, as you cannot hear them coming."
562,"The main open street serving area gives great access to the counter and is level from the pavement area in to the venue.
However the café area to sit in is a bit of a problem due to lay out and size of the area available however a standard manual wheelchair will go through the door and you can move chairs away from the table if you require."
563,Level access into the restaurant with a very light door easily manoeuvrable in my manual wheelchair. The staff were over immediately to find us an accessible table.
564,"Very welcoming, helpful and understanding "
565,"Accessible toilet on ground floor is very clean and spacious plenty room to move around and for a carer, situated by the little bird cafe "
566,"I visited Saffron Screen for an autism-friendly screening with my ASD son.  The staff were very helpful, we used the Social Story provided to prepare for our visit, and the provisions for the screening were very welcome (low lighting throughout, lower volume).  A really lovely, welcoming and inclusive afternoon out!"
567,Access was good. 2 disabled parking bays near the entrance.  Good clean accessible loo (although requires a radar key). Only issue is it can be quite busy inside.
568,Stratford is an accessible station and there are people in bright pink t shirts greeting you when you arrive. They direct you to the accessibility transport to the venue. We weee told where to come after the concert to be returned to the station. The people operating the minibuses were lovely and made the journey easy. I’ve never started a concert so easily. You are dropped next to an accessible entrance so really easy to use public transport. 
569,"In Cathedral close ( also accessible)
Step free access and toilet big enough"
570,I don’t remember any problems getting into the cafe part. There isn’t an automatic door but there were no steps at the entrance and the staff are very willing to help.
571,"Access was by the players and officials gate. It was manned with a steward who would give directions. The signage to the disabled are was ok not brilliant, but I'd visited in advance and had been welcomed and shown everything. The area has a good view of the park where a wheelchair user sitting can see all the ground. It's probably raised about a metre above park level and is in line with the edge of the penalty box."
572,Extremely helpful and polite
573,Costa is mainly accessible for wheelchair users. There is level access and a disabled toilet downstairs as well. The counter may be a bit high for some though.
574,"Very helpful and friendly staff. I did the gin tour and Mum waited for me in the Tearooms. While I was gone the staff went out of their way to chat to mum about the distillery, the weather, what we'd been doing etc. Nice touch.
A blind lady was doing the gin tour in my group and the tour leader made sure she was included, knew what was happening and gave more descriptive narrative as she couldn't see the pictures etc."
575,"Having asked specifically for a room with disabled access and being assured this would not present a problem, turned up to discover that the room was only accessible via a flight of stairs! Also, no grab rail in the shower/bath, so I am really confused as to what the hotel considers a disabled accessible room. 

We were there for a wedding, which took place in the hotel. To access that, we had to go down some steps, up another two sets of steps and then down another flights of stairs. No lift available to reach it. Thank goodness I wasn't in my wheelchair is all I can say.

It's a real shame, as the service was lovely and the room was small but nice. However, I dare not stay here again as my legs will not take it. They shouldn't be advertising themselves as disabled and wheelchair accessible."
576,"The loo was very easy for me to find and had all that I needed, with handrails etc. It was very clean and modern inside, and had obviously had some investment. It would be useful if it was a little bigger though."
577,Very cheerful and helpful.
578,"Abbey Street Car Park is close by (0.1 mile). There is also a bus stop located about 1 minutes away (Stop B10 V1 the villager, leaves from Derby Bus Station). "
579,There is a loo in the disabled changing area which is very spacious and has grab bars in the right places
580,"There are 2 disabled toilets in the ski centre. One is close to the ski slope and i think is used as a bit of a ""free for all"" toilet. The other- which is usually a bit cleaner- is behind DSUK's office"
581,Brilliant!!!
582,Right next to the bus & train stations. Disabled parking is next to the taxi rank at the train station
583,"Wheelchair friendly restaurant. Gorgeous food. Friendly, helpful staff."
584,Considering the building wasn't built for disabled access the team work extremely hard to ensure that peoples needs are catered for.
585,"Excellent access, loos and staff."
586,"We said I needed wheelchair access to the train, they told me where to stand (next to a padlocked ramp), train arrived but no one came to get the ramp. I had to make my way onto the train with some helpful passengers"
587,A lift takes you to the first floor. Access to the food area AND the disabled toilets is via a mini lift. This was out order on our visit and the staff hadn't contacted anyone to get it fixed!
588,"Mixed feelings! Firstly they had done the classic of storing the hoover in the loo taking up loads of space!!! Even if you move it, it is still tight and to get two people in if one is a powerchair user is a bit of a challenge. Thank goodness the door opens outwards! Having said that it was clean and tidy, we coped and it would not put us off from coming again!"
589,"What a fantastic morning spent on the beach, the venue is all set up to hoist you into the Beach wheelchair from your own chair. the Beach wheelchair can be self operated or depending on your level of disability you can be driven by your carer if required. I found the welcome from the young lady at the Beach hut to be, very warm and she put any fears or trepidation that I may have had at rest straight away. the experience was like driving my car once again after having to stop driving only 3 years ago, when I was unable to get in and out of my car. "
590,"Good parking and access at the entrance. No automatic doors, but helpful staff who would open them.
Once inside, very steep slope down to the museum. There is a hand rail.  Had to go down backwards ( manual chair user but if you have very good back wheel balance you might manage down, using the handrail for safety) . However, getting back up was not possible without assistance. 
The next couple of levels of the museum had much better slopes that could be managed independantly. 
Disabled toilet was on the lower level and was large and easy to access."
591,Grab rails in toilet which is clean and spacious.
592,Went with a group of disabled Veterans and was enthralled with the museum and did not want to leave. So much information and exceptionally well set out
593,"All the staff - guides in the rooms, members of the garden team, workers in the restaurant and shop, drivers of the buggies - were so kind and helpful. They just wanted to ensure we had a great visit and made the most of our day. "
594,"Staff were very friendly and helpful. It was a little confusing at times for me as I can't read the signs or the markings due to being visually impaired. Staff were quick to help and prevented any embarrassment of going the 'wrong way'. Staff managed the queues and people were able to social distance at all times which felt good. Overall, the helpfulness of the staff made for a great visit and I would visit again."
595,A delicious and unique cafe with lots to offer if you like abit of quirkiness. Not friendly for those with a disability but staff are very helpful and nothing is too much for them.
596,Staff knew little or nothing about hearing loops. Were'n't unhelpful but weren't helpful either.
597,The entrance to venue(see photo) is approximately 30 metre away from the car park. The entrance door is not automatic. There is a small lip at the doorway.
598,They were helpful and friendly
599,The sea front is about a 10 minute downhill walk from Brighton train station. There are also some local buses that stop nearby.
600,"The toilet facilities are brilliant - so spacious, well equipped and comfortable. They are always so clean and stocked with baby wipes and cleaning products. They are great for any age so hopefully as my daughter grows, I can continue to take her to Touchbase and not worry about accidents/changing etc"
601,"There is a large, flat tarmac area outside the restaurant, although this is not marked for parking so I'm not sure if you are meant to park there. There are several marked parking spaces outside the shop which is close by. The one blue badge space is near the shop entrance, rather than closer to the restaurant. However, it is very little distance from there to the restaurant for those able to walk and easy to push a chair because of the tarmac."
602,as previously
603,"We used this pub twice in a week (once on the way to a holiday and once on the way back). We had good food on both occasions.

On our first visit the pub was busy but the member of staff found us a suitable table (one I could get under in my chair.) At all times she spoke to me. She showed me where the disabled toilet was. ""Do you need me to wheel you?"" And she went on ahead to check the toilet was free.

On our way back we arrived for lunch earlier and the pub was quite. That said the young man who greeted us wasn't sure where to seat us as there were a few bookings. However, a lady came along and sorted it out.

A friendly pub with good facilities and lovely food. If you're visiting nearby Stonehenge or Salisbury it is worth a detour"
604,Beyond helpful and lovely.
605,ramps under building with clear signage and lift
606,This is perfectly designed for anyone in a wheelchair - no steps and facilities designed with wheelchair user in mind. No particular adjustments were needed for us with regard to visual or hearing impairment.
607,Toilets are really good with a choice of 5 wheelchair accessible available.
608,"Odeon Cinema is located outside the centre of Huddersfield, next to the Galpharm Stadium, which is sign posted from Leeds Road, Huddersfield. Is easy to find and is not situated on a rod that has a steep gradient. A large car park is available with sufficient parking spaces."
609,Toilets vary depending on where you are in the hospital on wards they can be tight to negotiate and then the other toilets in the hospital can be ok. Some offer better access than others. However the red cords in most of the toilets are tied up.
610,"Fino is a new Italian restaurant in Wakefield where the Cowshed was, and owned by the same people who own Robatary and Qubana in Wakefield. Access isn't great, I would guess the building is listed, and the toilets are upstairs. They did make concessions such as putting us at an easily reached table and offering me to use Robatary's accessible toilet, which is just down the road. For someone like me with a chronic illness who can walk a little with help and is more concerned with food intolerances, I would say Fino can work. For others, not so much. 

The food options are good for gluten free, dairy free and vegans. I can't eat gluten, potatoes, peppers or onions, which can be difficult in restaurants, and they accommodated me fine with plenty of options. Everything is made from scratch so he said I could amend most dishes, but they do warn traces may be found because there's only one oven etc."
611,"The Centre has a range of staff available to support customers, the information desk is staffed and there are concierge services."
612,Worth going there for the food
613,One small step into the shop and towards the outside toilet facilities. Outside in terms this is a former fishmongers with a large yard the toilets are located in one of the outbuildings.
614,"A great place to eat locally sourced food in a lovely location on the Heritage Trail around Loch Leven. Plenty os space, good signage, all on one level, plenty of parking, scooters to hire. Also lovely gift shopping and large deli. "
615,"There are two wide entrances just a few metres apart from each other. One has a small step down, and the other is completely level. Once inside, the restaurant is all on the same floor, but one half is on a raised stage accessed by a few steps. There are plenty of seats on the main floor however, and these aren't excluded from the atmosphere in any way. The tables are low and the chairs are moveable. There isn't a dropped counter that I could see at the bar, but it is table service here."
616,"3 accessible loos but can be a challenge to find. Loo on floor 01 (1st basement) next to the main lifts shaft, is small and narrow and not suitable if you need a carer. Although there are grab rails there isn't one that drops down beside the loo. Has an alarm cord and a mirror. 2 loos on floor 02 (2nd basement). One is in the old library down a series of corridors with powered doors. Its a reasonable size with grab rails, alarm cord and mirror. The second is in the newer part of the library round the corner from the new lift. Has foldaway light changing table. Good room, grab rails, alarm cord"
617,We parked just round the corner from the library. There were lots of parking bays.
618,level entrance but few tables  to fit a wheelchair  under
619,"When leaving the car I came across a ramp to access the building that has a gradient suitable for a mountain goat - definitely not for those who have difficulty walking (I use a four wheel walker). Going in was bad enough, but coming out (with brakes full on) was pretty terrifying. I wasn't sure if I'd end up on the roadway! I should imagine that a wheelchair pusher would have to be pretty fit to assist their charge, or risk a heart attack themselves!
The female disabled toilet was clean to a basic level, though smelled.
There was then another ramp to take you up to the eating area, not the easiest gradient but much better than the external. This area was not the most inspiring, so a cup of coffee was all that was consumed."
620,Very wide isles and front entrance to the store. Nice seating areas outside. Very well marked paving areas too.
621,"Friendly , helpful and knowledgeable and keen to make their museum as accessible as possible. Our guided tour was led by Sally , whose friendliness , enthusiasm and passion made the tour utterly enjoyable ."
622,No steps. Fully accessible disabled toilet. No push buttons on heavy door. 
623,Very clean and tidy - could have done with the Red Cord hanging correctly to the floor though.
624,Doesn't always smell as clean as it should
625,The cafe is at the heart of an attractive park run by the community. The outdoor seating area was sheltered  and bordered by plants in pots. The food was very good.
626,"In this review I will talk about the whole city of Bahía Feliz in terms of wheelchair access. Gran Canaria tourism for disabled travellers is developing quickly with more adapted taxis for wheelchair & scooter users especially in the more popular visitor areas like Bahía Feliz but outside the taxis there are much improvement the city of Bahía Feliz can make for wheelchair users. First off, kerbs in Bahía Feliz are about double the size of kerbs in Scotland and the drop down kerbs in Bahía Feliz are about the same size as average Scottish kerbs (If you somehow find an drop down kerb in Bahía Feliz)"
627,Entrance to toilets through heavy door.  Accessible toilet could not be inspected as it was occupied at the time I went to check.  Will check again.  Ladies and Gents toilets up three steps.
628,really good both in public areas and in the rooms.Automatic doors to reception and our hotel block. Dining room and bar accessed by lift which worked well.
629,"It's not perfect, but I've been to the Wimbledon tennis fortnight three times now, and found each time that there are well-established facilities in place for wheelchair-users. And if you are allocated tickets to Court No 1, the view from the wheelchair places is fantastic."
630,Owners George and Erica very helpful 
631,"They couldn't do enough for me and my party, ensuring we all had a great day together."
632,"I'm delighted to report that there is a new suite of toilets (the old ones were awful, cramped, tiny, with long jumbled queues) and that the accessible toilet is perfectly configured and quite luxurious. Again: full marks!"
633,Very friendly and welcoming.
634,"Varied toilets facilities to accommodate most, if not all levels of disability."
635,As next to central station easy to get to would not recommend bringing a car as dear parking in the town 
636,Very friendly 
637,Friendly and helpful.
638,Good access all round the ground great stewards all very helpfull and friendly
639,There is no parking specifically for this store however there are bus stops just along from the store and vehicles are able to pull up outside for easy access to and from transport.
640,Disabled access toilet with grab rails and baby changing unit.
641,"Being used to the more traditional style of distillery we weren't too sure quite what to expect. What we discovered was an oasis of excitment to stimulate the nasal passages, the taste buds and the understanding of why whisky is so important to Scotland. If you then add in a lovely cafe with an 'oh so tempting' menu, great staff to guide you, and a beautiful countryside setting you have the makings of a five star visit!"
642,Staff helpful
643,"The doors were already open when I arrived, so not automatic. Lots of room and space and my chair fit nicely under the table. Could get easily in and out."
644,"It’s hard work getting from reception and into toilets, there are far to many doors to push your way to get from one door to the next, you will need to take your carer with you to help open these doors, and then it’s only a basic toilet. Disappointing for such a large hotel.
 "
645,Two disabled bays directly outside of building with dropped kerb at one end. Unfortunately the delivery drivers frequently use and partially block them.
646,"This is really where the park excelled themselves! All staff were extremely helpful and nothing was ever too much for them. Whilst disability awareness is sparse, customer service is at the heart of everything they do. If you are clear in expressing your requirements and ask them specifically for what you need, they will go above and beyond to provide it. 

As already said, the staff put in an enormous amount of effort to ensure that I had a fully immersive sensory experience with the dolphins, which was above and beyond what they had to do. "
647,"Access in and around the building:

Getting around the building was good as there are bright wide corridors. The restaurant and bar were well laid out with good contrasting colours. Lifts were large and also went down to the swimming pool, gym and car park levels.

Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:

The accessible rooms were bright and spacious. Fitted with alarm cords and deaf alter pillow alarms.

Access in the dining area:

The dining area is large but there is a logical route in and staff will help you find a table.

Access to other facilities:

The reception was to the left as I went in. The desk is equipped with a hearing loop."
648,We travelled by car.Dedicated disabled parking space at the door.
649,"Nearest bus stop is the home of kirkcaldy buses, just a few metres away from the theatre. (5 minute walk)"
650,Large accessible loo. A bit dark.
651,"Plenty parking at adjoining Premier Inn Carpark.
Dedicated disabled parking clearly marked, would think they'll fill up quickly as shared with the Premier Inn, we arrived about 6pm and got one of the last 2 disabled spaces"
652,Took a while for someone to come out and serve. The first glass I was given was filthy and had the remains of someone's orange juice. I took it back for a clean one and without apology was given another. That was just as bad. I drank out of the bottle.
653,They're was everything
654,Staff in the shop and inside the stadium are very helpful and friendly. As it is a league 2 club ( although they should be promoted this year) all the staff get to know supporters who go regularly there is a happy friendly family feel about the stadium
655,"Excellent food and drinks, lovely staff in a reasonable accessible building. In the Summer when the doors are open I don't have any problem to get in and out of the building by myself. Only when the weather gets worse you call a member of staff to help you with the front doors, which are rather ancient. This place has got a disabled toilet where I can get in with my powerchair. 
All dogs are very welcome in bar area.
"
656,"Cannot comment on public transport as I took my car. There are 2 disabled parking situated beside entrance of restaurant. When we arrived both spaces were empty so my helper parked in second one as more turning space. Although when I got and away to go on pavement to enter restaurant I noticed my car was parked over the dipped kerp. Therefore my car had to be moved into the other space.

See image below of parking space where dipped kerb is."
657,"Good for buses, but I'm not sure how much disabled parking there is in this area."
658,Staff were very helpful and friendly.
659,"Clean, well designed accessible toilets on both floors.  Changing Place facility available."
660,Didn't use the loo downstairs
661,Always helpful and friendly.
662,"On return busstop for the  555 no dropped kerbside at Waterhead. Also driver refused to take us on same bus with 2 wheelchairs. 
Also very dangerous crossing the road at waterhead, no crossing lights. 
We wouldn't attempt this again. "
663,Has a changing place however is rather small with only excess to the bed from one side. 
664,"Access is via two wide doors these were open during our visit and staff  at the door to direct people to the café area and toilets etc. The main passage or walk ways around the venue had space there were a few bottle neck hold ups however there was around 5 coaches in the parking area and a number of cars.
The space between the displays in some areas meant you had to go in a roundabout way to get there but they are trying to show people a much stock as they can "
665,Entrance is step free and with powered door to one side. Atrium is light and spacious with reasonable signage. Off the atrium is the cafe which is a bight tight on space to manouever around. However the coffee and cakes are great. Also in the atrium is a large accessible lift with mirror which gives access to all floors. Corridor doors are generally held open. Doors into secure areas need cards to access and are then powered. The student social space is in the basement. Its large light and airy with a powered door to access. Many of the classroom doors are powered. The lecture theater is in the basement and is accessed by two powered doors. The top level is accessible to all. To access the front of the lecture theater you need to use a slow stair lift - key is gotten from reception at ground level. Unfortunately fire regulations limit it to one wheelchair user at the front at any one time. 
666,"Disabled access from station is quite ok, a long ride along walkway, narrow lift to take you down to all the hall entrances, reasonably short push to get you into the hall you are viewing, but after that, we find it rather frustrating as often there is not enough space for you to pass the thousand of other users, and it means sometimes missing a few areas you may have wished to see. Mind you, it’s all on the flat, so that’s something."
667,There is parking a available on Chambers Street if you are lucky enough to get it and you can use your blue badge. Buses also drop off on Chambers Street. There is also a taxis rank across the road from restaurant.
668,They are all great 
669,"Very good, they will help to make your trip here enjoyable."
670,"Calling any fellow bookworms.... you HAVE to visit Barters Books!

It is one of the largest second-hand bookshops in Britain, and created in what was once a Victorian Railway Station. This does nothing to convey the atmosphere of the place though, and it is the relaxed cosiness which is its greatest appeal. Squishy armchairs gathered round open fireplaces, helpful staff, tea and coffee for customers with just an 'honesty box' for paying, pet dogs are welcome; you are actively encouraged to make yourself at home and while away several hours here!

PS. Don't forget to visit the café!"
671,"The bus station is located near the city centre within a short distance of all the shops. There are a wide variety of buses available that go to places such as Edinburgh city and airport , Aberdeen and many more. "
672,A disabled toilet with grab rails but no pull cord
673,"All staff are extremely helpful, friendly and charming. There are a lot of staff - nursing, physio, admin, auxiliaries - and many are behind the scenes but all staff do an amazing job - from the CEO down. "
674,Arguably the best burgers in Edinburgh but not v accessible. One step to get in so OK for manual wheelchair with assistance. No disabled toilet.
675,I found the staff to be excellent. We're happy to move chairs and tables around for our accessibility needs with no fuss and were always happy to help bringing drinks across.
676,"Plenty room 
Disabled toiled sign 
Very clean 
Staff helpful"
677,The Motel One is a modern hotel build within an old building. It’s very well located for the railway station.
678,There is a pay-and-display car park Just across the road where blue badge holders can park for free. There is also a disabled toilet in this car park.
679,"Step-free access to the small ground-floor café/lobby area, a lift to the basement where the brasserie is, and plenty of room to manoeuvre around the brasserie itself. Not a step in sight. Full marks."
680,CodeBase staff are really helpful. If you let them know that you are here to meet one of the Euan's Guide team then they will let us know and we can come and collect you from reception.
681,There wasn't a disabled toilet.
682,Really friendly and helpful. Lavinia and family are on site and ready to give help and advice if needed.
683,"The national library and one of the largest libraries in the world. Anyone with a genuine need to look at the collection can apply for a free readers' pass and use their reading rooms. It also houses a business centre, permanent exhibition of historic books and manuscripts, as well as hosting temporary exhibitions and holding regular events. On site there is a café and book shop. The library has excellent disabled access which includes ramps, lifts, accessible toilets and providing study aids."
684,"This was a clean, easily accessible hotel, above standard for the region. Restaurant, reception and bar were on ground floor good for wheelchairs."
685,"No steps - the trail was all on a wide, smooth surfaced path with social distancing enforced. There is a dedicated email address for queries from powerchair and wheelchair users. The paths were well gritted too. 

Lighting is low in some places for environmental reasons and visitors are encouraged to bring a torch but we didn’t need to use it. Sound volumes are restricted to specific light shows away from areas of wildlife in the gardens. 

Signage was very clear and staff were easy to identify, friendly and helpful. 

There was a large, clear map of the event at each entrance and a QR code that could be downloaded to your phone or tablet with information about the sound and art installations. 

"
686,"Don't bother staying anywhere else if you want to visit Hadrian's Wall as a wheelchair user. This top-end modern hostel is just up the road from the Vindolanda museum and has: en suite private rooms (NB beds are made for you at YHA hostels these days), accessible bathrooms, cafe for breakfast and evening meals, and an accessible landscape discovery centre next door."
687,"Automatic doors, low counters and friendly staff! "
688,"It's about a 3 minute minute walk from North Bridge - if you go through the steps free arcade, plenty of buses go pass here, I can think of Lothian buses - 5,  7, 8, 14, 49. There's others I'm less familiar with.

Its about the same distance from Waverley Station, its up a rather steep street through."
689,Staff very helpful when requesting disability room. They asked me would I require assistance in case of fire.
690,"Overall access is pretty good for people looking for a walking route with a smooth path. The dark noisy atmosphere in the tunnel will not be suitable for everyone. It is a popular cycling route, so expect to pass lots of fast bikes (the noise they make coming down the tunnel sounds a bit like there is a train coming!) "
691,The staff were friendly and accommodating 
692,Because we pre booked staff came straight out with a ramp as soon as my carer made herself known. Plenty of room to manouevre in the restaurant but could not get the wheelchair under the table but no big deal. 
693,Lots of parking and free for disabled.
694,Staff are a ray of sunshine and couldn't be more helpful.
695,There is an accessible loo off reception I find it difficult to open doors but staff always seem to be on hand to help without being asked.   There is space for a carer and it was clean.   
696,Double door entry. Accessible tour. Helpful guides. 
697,"Throughout the walk all the pathways were very smooth and accessible, I only came across one area that was graveled like the car park but I managed to drive over it my powered wheelchair. I was really surprised that there weren’t any speed bumps along the pathway protecting any wires for all the lights they had.

One thing I would say is that there should be seating dotted around the walkway for visitors who struggle to walk long distances as the only seating I saw was at the food area which I think was just over halfway around. The walk took us approximately 2 hours however, we did stop to get something to eat. I didn’t manage to get a photo of the seating area beside the food vans as it was quite dark but there were only 4 picnic benches spread out which I feel they could have had more. It wasn’t busy so we managed to get a table but probably would have struggled at the weekend. Like most food vans where you order is quite high up and if I was on my own I wouldn’t have been able to order as there is a lot of background noise as well.

When I got to the entrance I got told that the last part when leaving isn’t accessible for my wheelchair as it is a field and the ground is very wet due to recent weather but someone will be there to help me another way. I got taken through the private grounds of Glamis Castle which was very nice but also very dark. Luckily the staff member had a very strong torch."
698,"We have just enjoyed 4 glorious days at The Rings. Accessibility at its best with wet rooms, ceiling hoists, bath lifters, accessible kitchens,  everything is top knotch. The cottages are spotless and set up to feel comfortable and home like with fully equiped kitchens and all the facilities you need to enjoy a fantastic break. There's floor and ceiling hoists, a profiling bed, single or king size beds, decking to get around the  building. A warm welcome and a glorious view. We relaxed because we e been on the go for 2 months but there's plenty to explore in the area for those who need to be on the move. "
699,"Some of the corners were a bit tight but a good day out I enjoyed it I would say it would be hellish if busy.

Staff where lovely "
700,I am a regular for this tuesday thing is its the 2nd tuesday of the month and I support it
701,Level access with double doors to the entrance. The ground floor is accessible with space for a casual drink or a table if you're dining.
702,"Nice wide aisles, easy to get up and down."
703,Staff were perfectly friendly but also gave you space to browse. They seemed happy to offer assistance when needed.
704,"See above. This is a tarmac path with a smooth surface and easy gradients.  From Craigleith Retail Park to Crewe Road North is 0.75 miles.  There are wheelchair accessible ways off the path on both sides of Crewe Road, with nearby bus stops. We explored the next section (the Ferry Road path). There are accessible ways off the path at Boswall Place (0.5 miles from Crewe Road North) and at Wardie Road (0.96 miles from Crewe Road North) and convenient bus stops on Ferry Road."
705,"Helpful, and good English spoken via email and on the phone"
706,This was my second visit.  The first was in 2014 when my experience was similar to the previous reviewer.  This visit was better.  The layout of the bistro has been greatly improved and accommodated four wheelchairs and carers with ease.  The service was good but the food was in my case average and in my opinion was overpriced.  I had pre-booked a tour of the brewery.  This was the highlight of the visit and if you're interested in this sort of thing it compensates for any deficiency with the lunch.  
707,"There is a disabled toilet which is spacious but has no emergency red cord.
 See photo "
708,"While trains run between Whitby and Pickering, both having large public carparks, Grosmont has a reasonable sized carpark which fills long before a train departs. Goathland Station has a very small carpark will no other carpark within half a mile. All carparks require payment including Blue Badge holders. Buses to both Grosmont and Goathland but very few and far  between. As for Levisham station it is so isolated that I doubt any visitor would find it by car so little carparking is available"
709,"The restaurant is located in a pedestrian square. There is a bus station quite close, but I didn't see it. I took a taxi to the nearby Plaza Charco and walked there in a few minutes."
710,"A huge car park, with three disabled bays quiet close to hotels entrance.
 DO REMEMBER TO REGISTER YOUR CAR to get out at barriers, or face a fine.
It’s easy to follow sat NAV directions as well."
711,"Next to a canal and road. Pub, restaurant, camping field, caravan site, on site hairdressers/beauty salon, launderette and camp/village shop. Popular with locals, tourists, boaters and motorcyclists.
Helpful staff, good food and drink make up for some of the old buildings failings. 
A nice touch for those not ""drinking"", is free refills of tea, coffee and soda water with cordial."
712,"Outdoor ramps up to the  Kunsthalle.  As the Lichtwark Gallery is an old building, there are a lot of steps inside, but there are also lifts (including wheelchair lifts) so you can get to every room - though sometimes not directly.

There are price concessions for disabled visitors, and the carer goes free.  The Kunsthalle is closed on Mondays

There is a lot more about disabled access on their website https://www.hamburger-kunsthalle.de/en/accessibility - if it is all in German, click the EN in the top right corner of the page and you will get all the information in English.
All the artworks are labelled in German and English"
713,"The venue is really good and accessible 

There is plenty of wheelchair parking spaces in the car park and within the areana "
714,There is a disabled parking bay on site next to the front door. Additional parking on site and at the roadside outside the building.
715,There is 1 bay for blue badge parking outside the venue and 2 small car parks near by. There are good public transport links though.
716,"Not bad, but could do better for such a popular venue."
717,Limited disabled parking on the street outside. I came by tram and mobility scooter.
718,"Portcullis House is adjacent to Westminster tube station, with step free access to the jubilee, district and circle line. Portcullis House is Exit 4. There are also a number of bus routes that stop close by."
719,"All areas of venue accessible.  My friend had to push me across the courtyard to the restaurant entrance, as uneven and sloped,making it difficult for me to manoeuvre.also quite a steep slope up to butchers area"
720,"I was really dismayed by the accessible toilet. See my photos.

The approach to the toilet is a combination of an extremely dark corridor combined with glaring lights which dazzle your eyes - a really nasty, uncomfortable experience.

In the toilet cubicle the lighting is very dim.

The red emergency cord was tied up high and out of reach. It was not possible to activate it from below the level of the grab-rail. This is VERY dangerous and negligent. If someone falls over in the precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back, and is injured and needs to summon urgent assistance, they will not be able to do so from the floor, and this could have very dangerous and serious consequences. The red emergency cord should reach all the way to the floor at all times and should NEVER be tied up or tidied away.

One other small point: the accessible toilet is labelled 'Disabled toilet'. This toilet is not disabled. It is for disabled people. It should be labelled 'Accessible toilet'. This is a small point, but important because the right wording shows respect for customers.

The basic layout and design of the toilet, if everything were present and correct, is good. All the problems above are caused by the stupidity and negligence of management and staff. 
"
721,"Staff brilliant, reception ladies in particular were most helpful
Offers to help push my wheelchair, but respect at same time for my independence, when I did not wish assistance
I had attended on my own and was frequently checked that I was ok, and that I was able to get home ok"
722,Kind and friendly staff
723,"Efficient, helpful and friendly."
724,"This area is alongside the Leeds Liverpool Canal and used to be a tip, but has been changed to a country park. The wild flower meadow is about half a mile long and has loads of flowers. "
725,"Part of the Odeon chain of cinemas, but this one has recently been refurbished, and is now an Odeon Luxe. The biggest difference being the fancy new seating, every single seat in every screen individually reclines making them very comfy, and they each have their own little table. Good screens and sound (actually possibly a little bit too loud!)

Easy wheelchair access throughout, lots of room to move in all main areas. Ramp as well as stairs to front doors, which have push-button opening. All on the same level once inside. 
This cinema recognises the CEA card.

Hearing loop available at cinema tills and at the Costa cafe in the foyer, also film adaptations available Eg. audio descriptions, subtitles (but would be better to check their website/in the cinema, as may only be certain showings)

Generally seems to be two wheelchair spaces per screen (is relatively small cinema rooms for an Odeon, but this can be a good thing!) These were at the back of the screen we were in, with carers seats (luxury ones!) right beside them. Tiered seating, so all have a good view.

There were steps going down to the other rows of seats, a handrail went down the length of the wall beside them. Loads of leg-room when sitting in the seats, so would be quite easy if you had to get in or out during film.
"
726,"The staff were very helpful and friendly. The reception staff ordered me a taxi on departure and it arrived in a couple of minutes. The waiter staff were always very attentive although the restaurant was busy. However, I was booked on a dinner, bed and breakfast basis and hadn't booked a time slot for dinner on Saturday. It wasn't a deal breaker but I was left standing while the member of staff went through pages of their list before they found my name and confirmed that they could get me a table, and I think given I have a visible disability/ crutch, it could have been handled a bit better. Therefore my advice is if you go make sure you pre-book a time slot for dinner. 
Big shout out for the cleaning staff who were amazing, not only was my room kept lovely and clean but they would see me coming and go and push the lift button for me, when I arrived back after breakfast and they had just started cleaning my room, they left so I could get ready to go out. They are a real credit to the staff team."
727,"The main entrance has steps and two side by side double doors, but there is a clearly signed wheelchair accessible entrance just to the side of the church via an opened gate. There are some cobbles to cross, but they are very flat. Once inside, the church is spacious, quiet and calm. The lighting is dim, but not too dark. "
728,Good large loo at back of cafe.  A few things (highchairs etc) a bit in the way outside of it but pretty good apart from that.
729,Great accessible loo on ground level. Clean and tidy.
730,excellent
731,Everyone is so lovely here! 
732,Just above the Metro St James. Two public car parks across the road. 
733,"Puerto de la Cruz is on the north coast of Tenerife. It's a traditionald and charming resort which caters well for tourists. There is the seafront and several beaches, a town centre which has lots of restaurants and shops, a number of beautiful gardens, parks and squares. Its a low key resort."
734,Level access with doors wide enough we believe to get a wheelchair through
735,"The main entrance is wide and level with automatic doors. Good circulating spaces and an adequately roomy lift. Our room was excellent in terms of circulating space, as was the ensuing bathroom."
736,"I am a season ticket holder at Inverness CT and obviously love Caley Thistle but I have to be honest that the accessibility is not great. First of, It can be hard buying a ticket if you're not registered with the club as being a wheelchair user. You have to be registered with the club (unless you're a away supporter) if you are wanting to get a ticket so bare that in mind. "
737,"When you arrive at the Dormy House you are greeted with steps. If you are a wheelchair user, have no fear - go around the back and there is an accessible entrance. Good accessible loo and lovely fire!"
738,Didn't drive but it is on a reasonable quiet street
739,Bus to and from the airport is shown as accessible but depends on who is driving.
740,"There are accessible toilets, these are spacious with grab rails and emergency cord. Toilets were clean. There is no changing places toilet."
741,"For such an old and iconic building, the wheelchair user access at KAGM is fantastic and has improved dramatically since it's refurbishment. Staff are extremely friendly and the disabled toilets come with all the modern equipment you would expect and are kept in a good condition. The availability of disabled parking can sometimes be tricky, but this is more to do with the sheer number of visitors that this attraction receives. It would be good to see it better enforced however.

 The KAGM is a must for able-bodied and disabled tourists alike!"
742,Former summer residence of the King of Greece and birthplace of Prince Philip in 1921.  The palace also houses a museum. There are extensive grounds.
743,"The toilets are outside of the coffee shop. When you enter the garden centre, there is signs telling you where the disabled toilets are, once inside the toilet I felt that it had everything that I needed."
744,Variable. Some were lovely and helpful. But some where really not helpful at all. I pointed out that the entrance tables left a very tight turning point for people and there was no way to access the ramp easily due to others entering. The response was ‘other people have managed’. 
745,"There are a number of streets on the flat, and there was enough for me that was accessible for a week. However there are areas I couldn't explore which are up a flight of stairs.  Most cafes and shops have a step or two to enter but many of the cafes also have outdoor seating. There are also some churches and museums to visit in the area. Some of the roads are pedestrianised but motor bikes or delivery vehicles frequent the area. I found most of the paving smooth rather than cobbled."
746,"They really try to help disabled guests, particularly in the way they have bathrooms in two disabled rooms. We stayed in the suite and some of the doors involved careful steering although my wheelchair is not wide. Bathrooms have Devon rails beside toilet and chairs on wheels in shower. You can access basins from chair."
747,I got a taxi from Waterloo. A little pricey but they drop you right outside.
748,I was pleasantly impressed with the service received at B+Q. The aisles are large there is plenty of room to drive my powered wheelchair around. Even the lighting section which is a bit more cramped still had space. I was really impressed with the service and a member of B+Q staff even offered to support my entire shop. I declined this offer as I only needed on product. but it was nice to be asked.
749,Very clean and tidy. It was also used as a baby changing station
750,"My name is Matthew, I am disabled and I use an electric wheelchair. For my birthday in October a friend gave me tickets to see the Wizard of Oz pantomime at the Atkinson Centre. I went with my Dad and a friend. Dad and I are regular theatre goers and would normally be looking forward to the evening but this time we were super excited because it was our first outing since the Coronavirus pandemic started earlier this year in March. We were also very apprehensive as social distancing measures were still in place. We didn’t know what to expect and wondered how safe we would be.

From the beginning the staff at the Atkinson reassured us. We pre ordered our drinks crisps etc. for the interval from the box office and were given information on the time we were to arrive and what to expect.
On the night we arrived at the time stated. Staff took our temperatures, ticked our names off the list and showed us to our seats. The theatre was socially distanced full about 100 seats. The performance was really great. My favourite characters were the lion, the tin man and the scarecrow. 

Everyone seemed to rise to the occasion trying to make up for the reduced audience. At the interval our pre ordered drinks were a little mixed up but the staff were on to it right away and got it sorted. Everything was conducted in a safe and friendly way. Seats not in use were clearly indicated and directions easy to follow. At the end we were the last to leave. Everyone went out in sections directed by the house manager. It was a happy crowd leaving the theatre, everyone enjoyed the show and the staff thanked us all for going. We had a really great and safe time and felt full of Christmas cheer and ready to enjoy our small family Christmas."
751,Good size accessible toilet. Carded 
752,"It is all on the flat. There are some cobblestones to walk over. Little bit chilly when you first arrive, but soon heats up. Bar bit high up if in regular vwheelchair or powerchair that does not rise. "
753,this is almost N/A as there is no parking for the surrounding area bar an NCP multi storey car park around the corner however with good pavements etc this wouldn't be an issue to get from. the street however is quiet enough for drop off with wide smooth pavements making wheelchair use easier.
754,Nearest accessible Tube station was Westminster - about fifteen minutes on foot.  Buses abound and presume could be taken to the venue as it's located in Victoria. Didn't see any Blue Badge parking nearby.
755,"Airport staff were friendly and helpful, but staff in the shops and food outlets were less patient."
756,"We have been staying here for many years now...  We have stayed all over the country in differing 'accessible' accommodation and this just knocks spots of them all.   It is a home from home.  The owners are very accommodating and the design of the bungalows is just fantastic and truly fully inclusive.  My partner and I have disabilities and we are able to really work as a team using the facilities, especially the kitchen...  Because it is so well designed, many of the things that can be a struggle or require support, we manage independently here.  The bungalows are large with wide corridors that are easy to manage with mobility equipment.  There are really well appointed bathrooms/bedrooms and the owners will provide equipment if they have it, and if they do not they will try and source it for you;  all they ask is advance notice :). The owners will even support people to source care providers if they need them.


We bring an assistance dog with us and she loves the opportunity to explore in the safe open green areas.   We honestly can not recommend here highly enough.  We are looking forward to our next holiday later in the year."
757,"At the front entrance, there are steps. There isn't a bell to alert for access and no signs to say if there is a ramp. However, I have been in contact with the venue to advise on how to improve this. There is a ramp at the back entrance in the alleyway up to Princes Street car park. The ramp us metal but wide with hand rails either side. The ramp needs reinforcing as it was like being on a trampoline in my chair! To access the cafe you go through the main hall and staff were very friendly and helpful. "
758,"As the venue is inside the Intu Eldon Square shopping centre - parking and transport are great. 
There are two large Bus Stations (Haymarket and Eldon Square) with regular accessible bus links around the North East. Both stations have accessible routes to the venue. 
Smaller more local bus stops for local bus services are also nearby and are again accessible and near easy access points to the shopping centre.
Parking is available throughout the City Centre with disabled bays being prominently displayed. The closest parking would be in Eldon Gardens which has 15+ Disabled Parking Bays and is also home to ShopMobility."
759,Clean and spacious
760,The staff are friendly and approachable 
761,"There is 1 changing places toilet with plenty of room for carers. The changing place toilet requires a radar key to access. It is located between Debenhams and Marks & Spencer. The main corridor does not sign post towards it. 

Another accessible loo is on level 1 near entrance to eagle market. 

On level 2 there are 2 disabled loos between food court and TGI Fridays one has radar key access. There are also two more loos next to Mark & Spencer's on level 2 one of which is also radar key access. 

Next to the changing place toilet is a small accessible loo. 

In total there are 5 disabled loos that I know of. They aren't all the same size. The ones I've been in difficult to turn in with limited transfer space."
762,"As a young Sheffield United fan I want to travel to away matches to back my team and Bolton Wanderers was the next trip! I am unfortunately confined to a wheelchair and away grounds can sometimes seem daunting experiences: where is the accessible parking, where are the seats, are they accessible, where are there disabled toilets etc.? Supporting your team is a great feeling (especially when you win) and with an understanding of the problems you might encounter, I want to share my experiences of football grounds with you so you can feel a bit more confident about stadium accessibility in the future. "
763,The staff at Springwell pub were very friendly. Staff were waiting to greet us at the door and ask us where we would like to sit. The staff helped us to our seats and made it clear that they were there if we needed any more assistance. The staff were always kind and polite throughout the whole of our experience. 
764,Level access entry
765,The entrance to the hotel is situated in its own car park with space outside the front door to drop off and pick up
766,Staff are fantastically helpful in providing accessible seating and advising on menu choices. 
767,"Small cafe (opposite the Green Welly). Plenty of parking, two disabled spaces but these weren't any bigger than normal spaces. Ramp access to door. Double doors which are quite heavy. Not much room to move around inside if you're in a wheelchair but staff were very helpful . Good range of food and lovely cakes."
768,Generally great - you have to remember that this is a trail and its not completely flat all the way round. There are a couple of short steep sections that are usually when the path changes direction and when you go across one of the short bridges. 
769,12 hole safari themed mini golf.
770,"Whilst this hotel used to be excellent, a recent visit found the facilities in the 'disabled accessible' room were very disappointing.
The low lavatory had 1 single - and very misplaced - grab rail.  I had to haul myself up using the heated towel rail.  The bathroom sink was of regular height and was built into a unit which I could not get my knees under.  To add insult to 'injury' the shower was a fixed head, over the regular height bath, and the provision for the disabled guest was a seat which sat over the bath like one of those old fashioned  racks that your granny had for her soap and sponge!  The chair swivelled to allow you to turn it round to sit on, then swivelled back to let you face the shower.  If like me, you have problems with your legs, you need a partner or carer to lift your legs over the side of the bath."
771,"The disabled access is around the side, a stores entrance too. You ring the bell to get someone to let you in. Often there are supplies that have been delivered left in the way and the person answering the door has to move them. There are limited 'kerbs' dropped enough to get over and you are left pushing on a road. There are steps at the front so this is the only disabled access. There is a sign to direct you around the side of the building. There is a lift to access all floors and push buttons to open automatic doors. There is limited seating. The only place to sit is when you go to watch the silver swan exhibition. "
772,Seriously impressive food.  Wheelchair accessible to boot.  Don’t know about wc as didn’t try to use it.
773,It is accessible but not very spacious for wheelchair users 
774,"Toilets are in the Stable Yard, there are no public toilets in the house."
775,"Ramp access into restaurant. Very spacious between tables, there are tables up one step but there plenty of tables on access level. Tables are at acceptable height for my wheelchair."
776,"Access at rear, so you can't get into all of the areas but it's pretty good."
777,Hard standing immediately outside the door with cover.
778,"Good public transport routes on Sauchiehall Street, Charring Cross Station is about a 5 minute walk away."
779,Level access to ground floor and therefore no problems in accessing the building
780,large  car park with many disabled parking bays
781,Staff were friendly enough.
782,Large supermarket car park adjacent.  Could only see 1 disabled space directly opposite restaurant door.  Not sure about public transport in the area.
783,The local bus stops close by or you can get a taxi which will stop outside.
784,Normal sized regular disabled toilets
785,"I recently managed to get back into Shrewsbury town centre , I’ve been on weeks of bed rest. 
 The council have recently spent many thousands on pavement works in the town. It appears that they didn’t think to consult anyone who is in a wheelchair and uses a ramp or tail lift(like I have) 
  They have put bollards on the pavements; but at the end of parking bays, this makes it not possible for wheelchair users to exit their vehicles onto the pavement . (See photos) 
  It’s very frustrating and I have tried to engage with the council,to no avail yet. 
  The situation will not help draw disabled shoppers if spaces ;inc the designated disabled ones can not be used by all !"
786,"Good access, room between tables and at counter for wheelchair user
Lack of signage for toilets"
787,"There is level access into The New Harbour Café, the door does need to be manually opened however when I visited the door was open. The door is also wide enough for a wheelchair to get through.

Most of the tables in the café are booths with a table leg at the edge so a wheelchair would not be able to sit at it. There was a long table at the door which had a long booth seat at one side of the table and moveable seats at the other side. When we visited the moveable seats were piled up to the side to allow a wheelchair to easily get access. Now I don’t know if this was a coincidence or if they have this set up for wheelchair user, mobility scooter users and prams. Anyway, it was really handy and if it is the latter reason then it’s good they think about this. The table was also at a good height for me in my wheelchair.

With me being with my helper, she went up to order our food because there wasn’t much room. If I had to go up myself I would have managed, but there was no need for me to."
788,"Great Museum in an iconic place in the middle of Edinburgh's city centre with great views towards Princess Gardens. With Accessible main entrance, the whole museum is in the same level having a fair space in between walls and corridors making it easier for everybody to visit it. The museum also has Accessible toilets. Worth to be visited."
789,I rolled there as its only 15 minutes from my house. There were quite a few kerbs without kerb-drops and lots of uneven round when coming in through the back via the carpark near Morrisons. I believe their might be blue-badge parking there though if you did have a car. Closest bus stop is right around the corner. 
790,"Entry is free. The fossils, rocks and minerals are attractively displayed, explanations are easy to read and there is plenty of space to manœuvre between them. There are a few interactive exhibits, and a section aimed at younger visitors explaining the work of a geologist. 
A great way to spend a couple of hours, learning about the local geology. "
791,4 spaces next to the front door
792,The venue itself has no parking as it is located in a pedestrian precinct but there is accessible multi-storey parking very near.
793,As mentioned pavements are lowered therefore this makes it easier to access the platform as there are no steps. Zebra crossings link a safe way to access the station as it can get busy during the rush hour at the station. Inside the station there are lifts which can be used opposed to the stairs. This makes it easier to access the bridge linking to all platforms on the opposite side of the station building.
794,Not the easiest to find but a relatively good size for anyone needing assistance on in a wheelchair.
795,Impressed with the parking set up. You come first to the main car park where there are 3 blue badge spots. If you carry on down the steeper tarmac path it is signposted for emergency and blue badge traffic only. There are two spots at the bottom here right next to wooden platform. Even if these are full it’s still worth checking as you can use the area to drop off disabled passengers. 
796,"There is a large car park directly beside the water park. The only issue is that the Disabled Parking spaces get filled up pretty quickly. 

Public transport wise, the Tram stops directly outside. They have power wheelchair access. "
797,The staff that we interacted with were helpful and friendly 
798,"Those we met were very friendly, willing to offer advice and support, so well done to them all."
799,"On-site parking is free for customers. The car park is situated at the front, side and rear. Guests can be dropped off at the front of the restaurant if required. There are 25 parking spaces. Although there is no specific designated Blue Badge parking, you can let staff know when you book and a space at the front of the restaurant will be reserved for you. The car park surface is gravel (very thin), but it is usually possible to park to avoid having to negotiate it.  We had drivend to the Inn and parked in the side car park, reversing in so that the ramp of our WAV reached the monobloc path. The monobloc path goes from The Residence to the restaurant, around the perimeter of the car park. Restaurant staff are extremely attentive and are on hand to assist if asked.

For full details and maps of how to reach the Peat Inn are available on the website. As it is situated in a rural setting, it is not on a bus route so arriving via your own transport or by taxi is essential.

The nearest railway stations are Leuchars (7.8 miles) and Cupar (6.7 miles). Taxis are available at the station. If you need an accessible taxi, it's best to book in advance with Williamsons on 01334 476787. Moffat and Williamson bus company runs a Flexibus service - details are available from www.go-flexi.org or telephone 01382 540624

"
800,Top class venue for pre match entertainment with friends and family
801,Staff were extremely friendly and helpful
802,The staff were wonderful
803,"I just assumed there was an accessible toilet with the other toilets - there was probably a sign too, but I didn’t see it.
Difficult to manoeuvre from the restaurant to the toilet due to tight corners and two doors to open.
Not a huge room but adequate for my compact mobility scooter. Grab rails present, clean and tidy. (I had a ‘red cord’ card ready but there was already one there!).
I like the Italian grammar lessons on tape in the toilet!
"
804,"There are several pay car parks nearby, and the Gallery is right opposite the main train station - so plenty of public transport.  We came by mobility scooter (and foot) from the hotel, so cannot say how accessible the parking etc actually is"
805,Parking is available in the adjacent car park and it is possible for  disabled visitors to embark near the visitor centre and then park.
806,The venue we could not use because having a wheelchair it was to busy for us and we were asked to come back as there were no seats and no room for wheelchair 
807,"Parking was right next to the front door and level, thus providing easy access to and from the vehicle."
808,"Staff were humiliating, patronising, ultimately did not care at all. I was given a seat at the top of three rows of seats that involved climbing across people and up stairs. On the way out I was sent down some pitch dark wet steps which took me around 40 minutes to get down. Their emails to me were basically bullying. Absolutely horrible experience."
809,All staff are ever so helpful towards every guest that enters the hotel regardless of ability. Upgrades or adaptions upon arrival if you find your condition or illness prevents you from enjoying your stay can be arranged and staff are more than happy to help.
810,Not great.  Toilet was very low down and the floor was highly polished so slidey under foot.  The shower was over the bath and although the bath side was low there was no hand rails to help you in and out.
811,Emergency cord tied up out of the way
812,"There are several escape games at Breakout Aberdeen - we played Black and White which was accessible and the staff advised all of their other games were accessible. There is a seating area when you first enter the venue with an accessible toilet to the right when you enter. The counter is high but you don't really engage with staff in the teception area instead you spend time in the seating area until your whole team are ready - there is plenty of space in the seating area for relaxing and using the facilities until you're ready to play. 

The game itself also has plenty of space - it was set out like a living room with sofa and coffee table but plenty of space to move around. The puzzles are mostly at an accessible height for everyone to get involved with. 

The only problem is that you're locked in a room by a key - there is an emergency key on the back of the door if you want to leave but if you do we were advised it stops game play and you're not allowed back in. We were advised if you wave at a camera to get attention we could be let out and then would be allowed back in. "
813,"If you are collecting your tickets upon arrival there are several booths from which to do so, one of which is lowered for ease of access for wheelchair users. The front entrance has a level access and this is continuous throughout most of the tour. The exceptions are the entrance to the great hall and Diagon Alley which are both on a slight incline. At the end of the tour (I wont spoil the surprise) there is an area which has ramps for wheelchairs to descend. There are rest spots throughout however, if necessary staff are also happy to provide visitors with a collapsible stool."
814,the hub is accessable for wheelchairs
815,"New Look is generally fairly accessible throughout. Level entrance. The front door is 1645mm wide, and is generally open. In winter only one door is open so it’s about 800mm wide. There is no bell or knocker for assistance on the front door, but they have them in the fitting rooms. They used to have a hearing induction loop but couldn’t find it. The till height is 1010mm. There are no Braille aids. There is seating available. There is no toilet, the nearest disabled toilet is in Costa Coffee a few doors down. We have not uploaded any photos as New Look need to check with their Head Office."
816,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced.
817,"The outdoor seating in front of the pub is step free and consists of fixed picnic tables and benches. Entering  the pub involves a single, small, low step and 2 sets of double doors, which were slightly tricky to negosiate with a crutch. Inside there is a central bar at standing height. There are free standing tables and chairs,which are quite close together. On the evening I visited it was busy and it was slightly difficult to get to a free table. The pub is on the ground floor. I didn't notice any upstairs seating."
818,"For a small venue in a cobbled area of Leith, I was pleasantly surprised by Harmonium's disabled access! The vegan restaurant has an impressively large and varied menu, and the atmosphere is perfect for after-work drinks or a catch up with friends. "
819,"From the lady at the Visitor Centre who clearly explained how to find the house accessible parking to the lovely security man who operated the lift for us, all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful."
820,"One of the main squares in Puerto de la Cruz, with garden, benches to sit, childrens play area. Square is surrounded by restaurants and bars"
821,"There is ample parking off Forres High Street, with disabled bays.  "
822,This was my first visit to the Lyceum and I wasn’t disappointed it’s a lovely theatre with good access. Accessible seats are at the rear of the stalls but it’s not a huge theatre so you are still close enough to enjoy all the action. Booking accessible seats was easy via the box office and with the free personal assistance ticket it was fantastic value for money. I use a fairly large power wheelchair and had no problems with access.
823,We drove there - it’s well signposted from the road and there is a decent sized car park. The Cambridge city sightseeing bus also stops there.
824,"Our tour guide was excellent and she prepared us thoroughly for the visit, gave a relaxed pace and responded to our needs. We were a small group and she was both well informed and very helpful throughout. The Town Hall Staff were welcoming and helpful, especially when we entered a room and when we needed to go against the flow of traffic. The enquiry desk on the ground floor was staffed by helpful and smiley people. The staff in the Sculpture Gallery Café were welcoming and really helpful. Service was quick and efficient. "
825,On street parking but often busy.
826,"TOILETS and REFRESHMENTS
Good access"
827,There was a lot which was handy.
828,"There is an 'accessible' toilet. Access to it was blocked by a huge stack of chairs which it took two men quite a while to shift out of the way. The toilet is too small, there is no room to park your wheelchair for a sideways transfer to the toilet (if you need this, stay away), there is no emergency cord. So it's a kind of half-hearted stab at the idea of an accessible toilet. Could be better."
829,"Not many blue badge parking spaces and when we got there all the spaces where taken so it made it problematic for getting me and my wheelchair in and out of the car.
We did mention this to customer services and suggested having more accessible parking spaces especially as the car park is very big.
If you don't have a blue parking badge there is some nearer spaces to the entrance but these are usually taken up first so there may be a bit of a walk to the entrance."
830,"It's hard to speak too highly of the hotel staff, all of whom were very attentive and alert to the specific needs of people with disabilities. On booking, it's possible to opt for a personal assistance care package. A variety of these are available, offering different levels of care according to guests' needs."
831,They were so good with disabled access. They were very clear where to park
832,"This friendly family run hotel was an excellent base for our (I was part of a group) Tyrolean adventure.  It had been used by the company before so our Tour Manager knew it.  Although not designed for   disabled guests, all our needs were met  and the language difference wasn't a huge problem."
833,"The staff were lovely, very professional.  I took half a mark off as there was no personality about them."
834,"Wheelchair accessible Parking
The nearest disabled parking space is in Calle Pireo however, the whole of the promenade is step-free and a great flat rolling surface so you can park in any disabled spaces behind the Arenal Beach area and then wheel to Bambula. If distance walking/rolling is an issue then the disabled space in Calle Pireo is the nearest.

Once you park there, you roll towards the sea and then turn right when you reach the promenade. La Bambula is the last restaurant that you come to."
835,"Car park has a number of disabled bays, parking area is level and has stone chips.
Level access, with specific entry and exit doors during Covid restrictions.

Farm shop, furniture shop, and restaurant all on one level, with scenic views of farmland and Ochil hills.

Low score due to the fact that whilst sitting in my electric wheelchair my knees would not fit under any of the tables. This meant I was sitting 18-24 inches from the table, very difficult to eat and drink from a distance, also made it hard to hear my fellow guests above the background noise.
Really irritated me, especially when staff seemed well aware that this problem exists. Maybe a small issues for them, but a big deal for me. "
836,The floor is leveled and the store is very spacious for wheelchair access and there is a lift in the building. 
837,"no bother at all. staff guide you through safely. 
theyve made adjustments brilliantly when raised and spent alot of money to make itsafe and accessible. the staff really do go out their way"
838,Full disabled access throughout - unfortunately there isn't anyone manning the ticket desk any more but there is clear opportunities for booking trains on the platform and help points on the station platform.
839,We got dropped off by a local taxi - they can get you pretty much to the door. There was a bit of gravel / uneven path just outside but we managed ok. No public transport nearby but that's pretty much the same with most of Skye.
840,"This is very much near the start of the exhibition - good accessible toilet, make sure you go before you go in as it would be a bit tricky going back."
841,"My reviews of record shops continues. This is another new record shop in Edinburgh, taking over from a classical CD store.

It is very fresh, with well stocked of mostly rock. There was some that took my fancy but the deals weren't great. I reckon the owners are still finding their feet.

There is a massive 200mm step at the front door, I did ask if they had a ramp and they sincerely said they would look into it. They then asked if I needed assistance getting out, which is something.   "
842,"Accessible for a manual wheelchair user with strong arms as there are some steepish parts. Accessible loo which is basic but does the job. Ramps to gift shop/tea shop etc. Parking  not great due to gravel, but staff spontaneously said that I could park on the Tarmac drive."
843,"Staff were really welcoming and pleasant, which made experience better."
844,"The main entrance has steps, but entry next door along provides a ramp, then it was easy enough to move around, but this hotel does have steps at points of interest, so it’s a case of look around until you find ramps to help you. You cannot get down to gardens though, and far to long a push to bother with other ways, but you can see gardens from terrace area."
845,Ramps onto barge.  Platform lift.
846,Staff are all very friendly and helpful. Phill the manager is very accomodating. Cup of tea was available too!
847,Lots of space but the corridor to the toilet is not very big.
848,"It would be my assumption that Vienna Airport was lacking in various areas given it needed upgrading. There as ample signage to and for facilities  not a lot of seating other than in the eating and drinking areas, fewer lifts that were small."
849,"Single yellow line at door, easy to get in and out as no steps and one slight slope in restaurant."
850,All on level ground.
851,Volunteers at the event were helpful. Top marks to the shuttle bus driver who was helpful and thorough.
852,"The road parallel to the restaurant is a main road which has trams running along. I didn't use the tram while I was there so unable to comment, apart from I noticed that the new trams had wheelchair signs by one of the doors."
853,"As a huge Friends fanatIc, I was beyond excited to be going to Friendsfest! And it was everything I hoped it would be. There are three sets there to tour: Monica's apartment, Joey and Chandler's apartment and Ross's apartment. During each tour there are at least 20 people, however the staff ensured that I spent some time, even just for a moment, my own in the set slack you get the full experience too. There are plenty street food trucks to choose from, including Joey's pizza, and a Mocolate van (but rest assured it is not chocolate they used). There is of course the Central Perk set with the clever cordon so that you can enjoy a coffee right next to TVs favourite coffee house. The only part that was tricky for a wheelchair user was a section for having your photo taken – it was a giant replica of the photo frame covering the people on Monica's front door. There is a decent sized step up to this however I am quite fortunate that I have a curb climber on my wheelchair."
854,"We stayed one night here on our way back from Scotland to home but it’s worth spending more time here as it’s not just a hotel but a World Heritage site with a visitor centre and plenty to see.
The hotel is in one of the old mill buildings and the rooms incorporate original features which add a bit of character to the otherwise fairly bland bedrooms. They are comfy enough and have good views and gorgeous photos of the site, which is by the Clyde and its waterfalls. Inside there was a bar (rather loud radio) and lounge (sunny and pleasant) as well as the restaurant and it’s all very easy to get about – they’ve obviously put some thought into access issues and staff were happy to let you sit wherever suited you best. 
Definitely recommended for somewhere a little different to stay. 
"
855,"It is very regrettable that this £11M publicly funded project was designed by HES without disabled parking bays or a drop-off facility.  Shore Road which runs by the Engine Shed is a narrow ( one lane in places with a chicane ) and busy bus route and even after being dropped off by my wife in Shore Rd, I found the walk around the building to the main entrance, some 60 plus metres to be challenging.  There is a disabled parking lay-by on the access road parallel to the railway which is obviously an 'afterthought' by the developers and Stirling Council as it is a considerable distance away and has to compete with train users and patrons of the several adjacent restaurants and cinema. Needless to say  such an arrangement does not take account of our Scottish climate.
If one was using a motorised chair,  access might at a pinch be straightforward, but overall, it is extremely disappointing and disadvantages the disabled, although there are spaces at the building  for unloading and a 'pool' car for HES staff........
It is difficult to see how it has complied with the Equality Act."
856,Easy access ramps with wide doors.  There are no problems regarding accessibility. 
857,"Fantastic place on Tuesday they were very busy but took the time to make sure we got in and seated having someone with me who is  partially sighted and elderly. The staff were fantastic they went out of their way to help us they even took our order and delivered it to our table.
Very impressed also with the new information on allergies a big notice easy to see and to understand. I myself have 87 allergies so was very happy to see this displayed.

I cannot praise this shop enough or thank them for being so helpful. Very happy indeed  "
858,"This castle is on the coast of East Neuk. Its not accessible but I found if I walked slowly and had my personal handrail, it wasn't too daunting."
859,The building has a good easy to find ramp and is well signposted throughout.
860,"I travelled by car so have no knowledge of any public transport but it is deep in the country about 10 miles from Northallerton so perhaps a taxi from Northallerton?

There is a large car park at Whitegates and includes Disabled Parking near the entrance."
861,Useless. A lady who was supposed to be a steward was watching the 2 disabled fans for the entire game like I was going to jump of my scooter and start dragging myself onto the pitch. Then at full time she asked ME to lift a gate to let people through.
862,Fopp as a chain sometimes tends to be cluttered with some stock on the floor but this shop wasn't too bad and the aisles where wider than normal.
863,"There are disable parking bays in car parks reasonably close to Birmingham New street station, but expensive. Most Birmingham buses have bus stops near to station entrance, but that’s hard work, so we prefer to travel in to station by train, leaving our car at home, or in free disabled space at nearest station to home. So far, we have not experienced any theft or problems by so doing.  Then this cuts out a lot of trouble during our journey into station."
864,"The disabled access in the main restaurant is very spacious and easy to manoeuvre round. The main doors are very heavy and I require assistance to open them. There is excellent ramped access at the front of the restaurant, There is a sandwich board which has been awkwardly placed at the top of the ramp platform. It would be helpful if this could be moved to the other side of the door to facilitate better access."
865,"There's automated doors at the entrance. Then immediately in front of you is a staircase and a platform lift to take you to the main floor. There's large lifts to each floor. The new Being Human gallery is located on the first floor. The exhibition is well laid out  and spacious. There is objects, art work, information boards and videos with captions.  There is plenty of seating with arms so it easier to transfer. 

At the entrance to the gallery there was a shelf on which were Being Human large print guide. Written above the shelf were the words, tactile map, tactile book, BSL and audio description. There was a note which said that the materials were coming soon and would be available by the end of the month (November 2020).

The exhibition has a lot of interesting items on display. The signage throughout the gallery was impressive. Black on a silver background which provided a good contrast and the title of the object was also written on the top of the signs in braille. At the bottom there was a number BSL and a headphones symbol and what I assume was the number in braille. One of the exhibits entitled Medical Heirlooms, which was an art work of vases representing different health conditions also had a tactile shape of the vase.  One of the display cabinets focused on disability."
866,The staff are really friendly and helpful . They make the isles wider if needed to be and make sure you have everything you need and want.
867,"Lots of dropped kerbs and flat area, but cobbles in some places. "
868,Accessible Loos were spacious and spotlessly clean.
869,Shoe shop with plenty of room to get round with a big wheelchair and very helpful staff... and your dog can come in too!
870,"All the equipment necessary to make it great in theory, but in practice staff awareness let it down badly!"
871,Dedending on night of visit it can be challenging to find decent car parking close to the venue. The area lighting can become a bit of an issue the further from the venue you get. I'm not aware of any bespoke parking.
872,The staff member who served me at the counter was extremely welcoming and helpful. He asked me to take a seat and offered to bring my drink to me. Great service!
873,"There's very little accessible public transport in the vicinity. Bus routes 44, 137 and 452 will drop you off at the Chelsea Gate of the park. I don't know about parking."
874,"Apart from the small step at the entrance, access is generally good. Space is a little tight between some tables, but all the furniture is movable and not fixed to the floors or walls. The restaurant is brightly lit, and the music is very dim. Floors are smooth and there is a short ramp between the two slightly different levels of the restaurant. More seating is downstairs. "
875,Easily the most roomy disabled toilet in existence.  6 power chairs could do a formation dancing routine inside!
876,The park is staffed by a team of Rangers who are very helpful and can advise on the best routes for wheelchair access as well as what to see and do.
877,"We had a casual social evening at this cosy pub. The fire was on, food was great, staff was very friendly, service was great and quick too. There was also live music on that night, so we had a great time!"
878,Extremely friendly and helpful staff
879,"All the staff were very helpful and assisted us , by opening doors when leaving and arriving at the restaurant."
880,"There were no steps into the shop making it easy for me to get in and out, and the layout was superb, there were one or two tighter areas but staff were on hand to get any items should I wish to inspect them further. the pavements in North Berwick are levelish but not the greatest a bit narrow at some points. and with people trying to get past things got busy and may not suit persons of a nervous disposition."
881,"the disable toilets are fitted with alarms, D locks, baby change units, and supports for people. most of the toilets are easily accessible with plenty room, except for one where the disabled toilet and door are fine but the doorway to access the disabled toilet is too narrow"
882,Staff went out of their way to make things easy for us.
883,Our ensuite bathroom and loo were spacious. A shower chair is provided and there is a wheelchair accessible wetroom shower. The accompanist enjoyed the man-sized bath tub. The loo is equipped with a grab rail. Side transfer from one side is possible. The washbasin is approachable in a wheelchair.
884,Level doorway but narrow and heavy doors so a little awkward
885,"There are no step-free stations nearby, though Tottenham Court Road station may be step-free some time in late 2016. Several bus routes will drop you nearby in Shaftesbury Avenue or Charing Cross Road."
886,A raised over toilet seat was provided with rails on either side.  An over bath shower was accessed with a bath stool.  This might be difficult if unable to self transfer.  A grab rail over the bath was provided.   All spotlessly clean.
887,The toilet space was just about manageable but the red cord stops short of the ground. (card attached now)
888,"Wheelchairs have to be left outside the house and then the visitor transfers to a house wheelchair. There's two short flights of steps to get into the house, a staff member helped my husband  get me up them to get into the house and then get me down them 2.5 hours later when we finished our visit. All the staff we encountered were very helpful and if they didn't know the answer to a question that was asked immediately went to find the answer."
889,"Monboddo is a lovely, spacious bar on Bread Street just off Lothian Road close to the city centre. There is a relaxed atmosphere here with a well stocked bar and good selection of food. "
890,The parking is good as you can park in the spaces if there's any left near the spa post office. 
891,"As a blind person I found all steps in Mexico really hard to see. I also found signage to be very small and roads to be uneven. But I was perfectly able to navigate, just at a slower pace. There was no hoist into the water from what I could see, but I didn't need one. "
892,"Since the previous review there has been the addition of a visitor centre, a very modern environmentally friendly accessible circular building .  It has toilets including an accessible one, seating, a cafe and an educational area and is situated just 500 yards from the beginning of the beach and close to the car park.  "
893,Very friendly and extremely helpful. If you can’t visit on the open weekend contact the artists/crafters/designers directly and arrange a visit direct with them. 
894,"Attached to the complex their is a multi storey car park with lifts available, spacious enough for wheelchair users."
895,Without exception all very helpful guiding us through restaurants and bars helping with the lifts and offering help
896,Very easy to find. Spotless. Good handrails. Perfect.
897,"Two double doors to get in. Lots of space inside to move around, mixture of booths, seats and tables. When going up for a carvery a member of staff will assist holding your plate and picking food etc. The bar is big and a wheelchair user can see over the top. There is a self serve soft drink machine which is low enough for a wheelchair user to use also. Lighting is dimmed in some parts of the restaurant. Music is played in the background in the bar area."
898,Staff kindly left the door open to the conference centre so I could use the loo. Staff were friendly on site.
899,"Jacqui, Carl and Max are brilliant hosts who cannot do enough for you.  The area, and Brittany as a whole, is so pretty with lovely places to visit.  We are not disabled and therefore did not need much assistance, but we felt right at home in this lovely place.  We are definitely going again in 2016."
900,There is step free access 
901,All on the flat and push button for door. Ramp access to upper level..
902,"Level access into cinema complex and there is a lift up to the Starbucks area. The lift is rather small, myself in a powerchair and one carer squeezed in. There are couches, armchairs, hard chairs and soft benches to choose from. "
903,Although the tearoom is easily accessible for everyone - if you would like to walk around the forestry centre you may find it extremely difficult many of the paths are made from mud so become slippy and uneven.
904,The staff at Broadmarsh are all very friendly and willing to offer help and support to all customers.
905,Couldn't have been more welcoming and friendly. Went out of their way to make sure we had a great visit.
906,"helpful staff on the most part, the guy in Waterloo, particularly so."
907,The man on the desk was exceptionally helpful. The other staff were friendly too. 
908,"For a historical building, visitor attraction and fully functioning Church this a delight to visit. As I am profoundly VI, I contacted York Minster about visiting, I was passed to a member of their Visitor Services Team who  explained everything they could about a VI person visiting the Minster.  The time, explanation and details taken and given were exceptional. I stated I was arriving by train and booked me a slot to coincide for my tour with my arrival and departure, as they could see me approaching the main entrance I was warmly welcomed and assisted through the entrance bypassing the queue that was there. I was introduced to my guide who had a B, VI, and PS pack available  - I had already asked for the ordinary tour the a B, PS, VI tour to  fully appreciate and note the differences. Although there was a charge of      £10.00 the concession price was £9.00. Both tours were tremendously well    done, the guide used her skills of clear explanations and the touch sensory  aspects match brilliantly which contributed to a visualisation of what was around me. Wood carvings, masonry, marbles and the windows that were out of sight , touch and reach were supplemented by  3 D touch floor   building and plan with a Braille explanation and electronic pen that was a audio guide that told of what the pen touch on all in a A4 size folder and bag with touch directions for each solid board of the book that made up the guide. There are also full explanations on the tracery and windows for anyone to use in computer screen form with a zoom in and out with a detailed explanation.. There is an extensive, accessible shop that covers the fabric, widows and masonry of the Minster it is well throughout and is not cluttered and difficult to navigate round."
909,Very helpful and nice to chat to
910,"Courtesy wheelchair available, audio descriptive available 
4 dedicated wheelchair spaces in centre of theatre with easy access
Just let box office know if you have any requirements "
911,"Into station and onto platforms great, but access to trains Very difficult"
912,Building is easily accessed via side ramp on right hand side of building. Lifts are large in size and disabled toilets located on each floor. Limited Blue badge parking bays located outside student association building. 
913,"The staff were very friendly, helpful, & keen to hear if there were things they could do to make things better. "
914,Saltram is a National Trust house and garden that is mostly accessible with a wheelchair and has relatively easy routes around the garden.
915,Very chatty and friendly.
916,"I attended this game with a friend who has suffered a  massive haemorrhage two years ago and was going to his first match since that. He lives locally and used to attend a few matches each season.

I went to the ground in advance and was shown access, toilets and the reserved area. On the day we were able to park within 200 metres of the ground though that might be trickier if a big team was visiting. Pushing a wheelchair to the ground and inside the ground was easy - all mostly level with a lights controlled road crossing.

We didn't have to use the disabled toilet, which is about 100 metres from the reserved area.

Access was free for both of us.

It's a wee ground and a bit primitive but the atmosphere was totally welcoming."
917,"Friends had to go in and ask for ramp. 2 ramps that were quite steep were put out by a stoney faced staff member and not the easiest to manage. No disabled access  to outside seating in garden at back, so forced to sit inside in dark interior and sunny outside. "
918,"Parking available on the street front by 23 The Grill- a couple of which are disabled. If unavailable, there is a short stay car park behind the establishment about 100 yards away with plenty of spaces."
919,"The staff we interacted with were all friendly, helpful, and enthusiastic about cars..."
920,When this incinerator burned down (ironic!) the Austrian artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser gave it a fantasy make-over and turned into a tourist attraction. It's wacky and wonderful.
921,All disabled seating is in boxes upstairs. The boxes are nice with plenty of seats for friends and family to sit with wheelchair user. However there is only one lift which can only accommodate one wheelchair and carer at a time so can take a while
922,Not as advertised.
923,Friendly/ helpful staff...eager to help and advise.
924,"Signage excellent as with most major airports, no lifts all ramp access, "
925,The staff were friendly and listened to us and supported us with our communication needs.
926,"Don't try and park in Hampstead! The tube station has a lift, but it also has numerous steps, so it's not at all wheelchair-friendly. Golders Green station is nearby and is step-free to the platform. You could get a bus from Golders Green; or from King's Cross or Hendon Central (both totally step free), which would be a longer but easier journey. Whichever way you arrive, the approach to the house is VERY steep and you will need very strong motors or a very strong wheelchair-pusher!"
927,Generally a welcoming and great venue for disabled customers.
928,"The ramp to the front door was manageable using my manual wheelchair. The front door was a little difficult to open, but the staff member came to assist me. The stairs have a banister which has black and yellow taping around it to make it visible for anyone with a visual impairment."
929,No transport links to the factory but good blue badge parking next to the entrance.
930,"We didn't need much assistance from the staff, but they were welcoming and helpful generally "
931,Wide fronted doorway. Wheelchair accessible toilet. Disabled parking. Function room with direct access from car park.  Fantastic food and helpful staff.
932,Access is good once you get up the little curb from parking
933,Plenty disabled bays right outside the door.
934,There is a street closed off for blue badge parking. All you need to do is show your blue badge and show your ticket.
935,Their is one parking place for blue badge holders outside the building and a generous car park at the back. There is a bus stop within 100 metres
936,"As regular visitors to the theatre I can't recommend it too highly. The Theatre is fully accessible throughout and offers excellent performances throughout the year. The cafe, restaurant shop and tower which offers great panoramic views over Stratford town, are all easily accessed. Situated on the River Avon it is a pleasant place to have a meal or a coffee and there are accessible walks through the parkland along the river."
937,"The disabled toilet was close enough to reception area, easy to arrive at, but then found it smallish, and untidy. Grab rails are there for you."
938,"There are several toilet facilities. All the toilets are spacious and all have disabled facilities. However they are mainly populated around the food areas of the park. There are none, that I can recollect, around the zoo area."
939,Ramp access to front door.  All on one level inside. Not a lot of space to move around in a wheelchair. 
940,Disabled parking bays are directly next to the front entrance.
941,Level access to the coffee shop & a ramp to the farm shop. Coffee shop has a reasonable amount of room between tables. 
942,Clearly marked on map with good signage.  Large easy access. 
943,"We have already reviewed four hotels for you that belong to the Handpicked group of hotels, and they really are delightful hotels, 5 stars the norm, so we were really looking forward to our overnight stay at Nutfield Priory.
What a disappointment !
It started off well, the driveway towards the hotel looked great, (photo 1) spring flowers opening up, well cut and maintained grounds, and the old building looked 
historical and grand (photo 2) the tower of the entrance guarding the hall, old chimney pots looked magnificent, we were ready (3).
We parked opposite the entrance in one of the two disabled bays (4) and headed for the hotels entrance, and found a step waiting for us. (5) No ramp in sight, so my husband had to get up out of his wheelchair, and stagger up the step.  Inside we were greeted by two very friendly receptionist ,and who turned out during our stay to be very kind and helpful, and the reception area looked old but pleasing enough (photo 6) Booking in was soon done and we would be escorted up to ,our room on the second floor, and we were pleased to be told that a lift was available, which was situated behind the reception desk, through a very narrow doorway and small tight square passage (photo 7 shows the entrance behind the lamp) with a turn to get wheelchair into the small lift, where my husband continually seemed to catch his hands against the lifts edges, causing him to scrape his hands, and wipe the blood off his knuckles.
A corridor led to our bedroom (8) number 25, and pleased to see we could leave wheelchair by front door (9) and the room looked very nice (10) with nice big bed for us, ( BUT THE ROOM WAS FREEZING) the cast iron radiator was not working, so we tried to sort the heating out by putting setting to high on wall panel and hoped this would warm the room up. There was plenty of room to move around (11) and in 
walk-in bathroom we had soft white towels and pleased to see pull cord connected to call button (12) while the walk in shower was plenty big enough for us (13)
Right, time to investigate Nutfield Priory.
We took chair into the large delightful drawing room (photo 14) with lovely glass framed windows offering plenty of light, and saw the 1874 restored organ which suited its place in the historical hotel (15), (BUT AGAIN IT WAS FREEZING IN THERE)
the fire, set in the original fireplace was ( not lit until the next day ) (photo 16).
The side doorway would lead into the bar lounge with its small but nicely wooden bar (17) which took us to see the delightful restaurant (18) which was nicely laid ready for dining tonight.
The old wooden panelled library was interesting and looked authentic (20) 
and would be a pleasant quiet place to enjoy reading one of the many books and catch up with the history of Nutfield Priory.

HISTORY
It was difficult to find the early history of the Priory, but we believe it was once a home built for Monks, so our history continues from records of 1849, when this original mansion was rebuilt by Thomas Fowlerwood. From 1855 a banker, Henry Edward Gurney added much improvements to enhance this mansion, until he was declared bankrupt, so the property was sold to Joshua Fielden who was once an MP in Lancashire, and he basically rebuilt the property, to include the Tower. He had 11 children with his wife Ellen, and he was known as a caring man who sought the interest and welfare of others. When Joshua died in 1887 Nutfield was held in trust for his wife Ellen, until 1920 when she sold the property. 
It was then sold to a Mr Ferris, who lived here until 1930, then under the care of 
Mr O Picton Davies he turned the property into what we start to see today, a very expensive hotel, and he included  nine hole golf course by the lake.
Over the next few years a number of changes were made in how the mansion was being used, until its opening as a boarding school for deaf children, but this closed in 1987, and a year later it opened up as a hotel again.
It is now under the care of Handpicked hotels.

To continue with our details of hotel for you, and why we were so disappointed with our visit.
 It seemed to us that Handpicked Hotels have allowed Nutfield Priory to have that look of neglect, and has been allowed to go downhill for some years now. Paint has stripped off woodwork, the stained panels and doors need work to be done on them, carpets have threadbare areas and joints are separating and look tired. The general appearance is not up to the standard of other Handpicked Hotels we have visited and reviewed for Euans guide in which we gave top marks for, so having paid so much money and so looking forward to staying here, it was quite a shock to see the place so neglected.
And worse of all, the whole building was SO COLD, there was no heat on anywhere, and we froze in our room. We were of course given the usual rubbish, our maintenance manager checked the heat this morning and it was working,) just how 
many times have we heard that, and other guest were also deeply concerned that we all had to feel so cold. It’s not cheap to stay at Handpicked Hotels, so all in all, a big disappointment for us personally. 
Out next visit for the groups hotels will be to Rookery Hall, and we do so hope that will bring back our confidence in handpicked Hotels. Mind you, may we say thank you to the young receptionist on duty that evening, she tried so hard for us to get warmth, she took the time and trouble to spend an hour hunting around the hotel to find heaters for us, and kindly brought up two heaters to our room, so that on waking the next morning we had a warm room, so thanks goes to her for her effort on our behalf.


OUR FINAL THOUGHTS About our part one review of Nutfield Priory hotel.

Leaving our disappointment behind, this could again become an interesting and historical hotel, it’s got a lot going for it, and if you read part two and our part three, you will see that we have offered far more favourable remarks on our visit here, but it’s just at the moment, until management get the hotel back up To a standard we expect from Handpicked hotels, then we shall not be recommending you visiting or staying here."
944,"Changing place included in the accessible toilet, that needs a radar key to get in. Large and well equipped; very happy with this toilet. "
945,Apart from the massive step the rest of the shop is flat and spacious.
946,"The staff are pleasant, but often very young, and a little inexperienced. "
947,"The cafe and toilet are on the higher level, do not attend to wheel back up the ramp as there is a lift."
948,There are no steps from the car park to the main entrance. The gym is on the same level as the reception. There are lifts from the gym down to the changing rooms.
949,"It was really easy to access all the plants as there are both smooth and gravel pathways as well as ramps to access the shop, entrance  and covered area.  There are benches located in the covered area too if you need to sit down.  Plants were mostly at a height that I could see easily from my chair."
950,"Overall, York Railway Station is accessibly for anyone with any abilities. It is evident that they have worked hard to make sure the station is accessible for everyone."
951,"Although English was limited, all the staff were cheerful, friendly and accommodating - getting to 'know' us over he week.  Ready to help with moving chairs etc, they made our stay enjoyable."
952,5 accessible parking bays close to the main building
953,Always happy to help when we go
954,"New automatic and assisted doors throughout the museum and very helpful staff
The Manx Museum in Douglas also has the only changing rooms toilet in the IOM
"
955,"Just on the outskirts of Ryde opposite Tesco. As well as the normal plants etc.. Has wide range of gifts, home ware, wild bird food, accessories and clothes. Also sells crafts, Yankee candles and more Restaurant has a wide range of food, drinks, cakes and pizzas.  Really great food and great environment. Has a great balcony you can set on in the summer (has wheelchair access)

Bus stops outside. Large car park. Flat access throughout. There a few wheelchairs to borrow. Disabled toilets on the entrance floor and lower floor. Lift access to all floors. 

Great for a shopping trip (especially at Christmas when they have Christmas World) or just for a meal in the large restaurant."
956,it is easy to access and available wheelchairs to borrow.
957,Access from the front of the shop is step free & there is a reasonable amount of space to find a table although it is sometimes very busy. there is a separate lower level accessed from inside down a few steps or from the side entrance where there is 1 step.
958,"It is easy to find the disabled toilet, but if you are unsure staff are willing to help. However due to the size of the premises it is quite small and not the easiest to manoeuvre in."
959,Reasonable GP with okay access for a wheelchair user. Could do much more.  
960,"Some doors not automated, one small cobbled section to cross."
961,"One of Broughton Street's newest bar additions is quirky and friendly, but sadly not very accessible."
962,The staff were very helpful and gave a warm welcome on arrival.
963,"Upon arrival the first thing to encounter is a steep concrete slope from reception into the main park, 
I struggled to hold my chair back and the slope is too higher a gradient for someone to hold a wheelchair back from rolling safely.  
The pathways around the park are mostly broken concrete with plenty of pot holes to catch front wheelchair castors in. 
The majority of the animal enclosures have areas of bark chippings or turf from the pathway to the fencing ranging from 3-10 feet, these areas are very difficult to maneuver even for a seasoned active wheelchair user like myself.
If you can get close to an enclosure then you are met by a 4ft secondary fencing which is quite thick in it's construction and obscures vision considerably, so much so it was impossible to capture any decent photographs of the animals.
The lion enclosure viewing area was impossible to get to as the access is made of deep gravel and on a hill.
"
964,Cafe staff friendly and helpful.  Didn't meet any other site staff.
965,"There is a council run car park next to Marine House. One disabled space. The owner has an agreement with the council that residents can use the car park free of charge. The disabled space us marked, wide and paved.

The rest of the car park is gravel - which might prove a challenge for wheelchairs and some scooters. 

From the car park to the hotel entrance is maybe 50m 

There is double yellow lines outside the hotel. So on with a blue badge?"
966,"There is limited parking on the road outside the Post Office but thus us not usually free (busy spot on a busy road). There is a car park to the rear of the Post Office, bit not all tarmaced, and can be a little dangerous getting from car park to PO due lack of path/parked cars (alternative being to take the long way round to stick to paths)"
967,"The staff member who saw us parking and helped us in through the restaurant, carrying a bag to our room, deserves special mention. Also the staff member who seated us for breakfast - he made sure we had a table that suited my needs and checked whether I wanted to transfer or not."
968,Unfortunately I would havfe to say that I felt I was putting the staff out a little with my visit and felt excluded when placed in an area away from everyone.  I had been told by others that staff were very friendly so was sad to be made to feel like this in an otherwise pleasant visit.
969,Easy access to all areas of this Hotel complex. All the staff have a can do and helpful attitude. Wheelchair accessible rooms also. Taxi with wheelchair transport  arranged from airport to complex. The place is a shining example for others to follow.
970,A nice spot to sit outside and watch the hustle and bustle of Grassmarket life. Easy to wheel in and plenty of space.
971,We had our own private car park for our caravan which was very good and convenient. 
972,"Large disabled car park near entrance. best way to attend!

Not sure of ease to use public transport links."
973,Stagecoach bus stop available directly outside of the building. There were only 3 disabled car parking spaces.
974,"The accessible bathroom was superb. Nicely equipped, spotlessly clean, and plenty of space. Wet floor shower, lowered sink unit, and ample grab rails."
975,Didn't really meet many staff.  Those at entry & cafe friendly.
976,The toilets in the accessible rooms were a good size with plenty grab rails and wheel in showers.
977,The entrance is step-free and there is plenty of space within the shop to move around. Everyone is on the ground floor. There is no seating except for the piano stool. 
978,its perfect for people in wheelchairs as the is a concert path going all the way around.
979,Easy access for all whether in a Wheelchair or not.
980,"A step-free entrance to the shop, and the aisles are very narrow indeed. Once you've committed to going down an aisle you have to keep going or back out - don't even think about turning round. Some parts of the shop are too tight to get a wheelchair through, but if you take detours you can get to every display shelf. Half a star lost for these tight difficulties."
981,The staff are great and there was no rush to make you order your meal or when they came with your bill at the end of your meal.
982,Access into the building is easy for wheelchairs
983,"No emergency cord, room was tricky to manoeuvre in because the baby changing table was not fixed on the day I visited and took up half the room."
984,Very good for a wheelchair. Nice flat access and space to manoeuver. Mobile hoists may be hard work on the carpet.
985,Sara was lovely & incredibly helpful. We only wish we stayed longer!
986,"A modern restaurant with good wheelchair access, right across from the concert hall. Although it's on quite a hill, there is a solid ramp on the side and the camber is not too bad. There is outside seating available at the front of the restaurant where you can take in the atmosphere if you would prefer. 

Inside the glass door, the restaurant is spacious, on the one level and with a range of different seating options, you need not feel like second thought. Plenty of room to move around in a wheelchair. 

Plenty of food choice and food quality was quite good. Quiet enough to have a decent conversation and didn't feel too rushed. 

Overall, I enjoyed my visit and would return. "
987,"We parked just in the driveway of East Cottage.
It's very tight and you need to reverse into the parking space but it is possible.
We have a Passat estate and managed."
988,Staff are very friendly and helpful; they are useful if help is needed to reach a platform and to provide extra details regarding train travel. They are also very useful to provide ramps for easy access on and off trains.
989,"There are two reasonably sized accessible bays outside. You can also use the drive through. The dropped kerb & pavement was very smooth. 

The Park & Ride bus stops near by. "
990,Staff are always very helpful and friendly.
991,Lodge has a wet room with grab rails at loo. Access is via carpeted bedroom. We managed transfers with a sara stedy despite the carpet. 
992,Wheelchair accessible community cafe offering excellent homebakes and light meals.
993,Great disabled toilets on both floors
994,"This café is tucked away in a hidden courtyard just moments from the sea front and is well worth seeking out. It’s surrounded by a few independent shops and studios. There’s two entrances to Libra Court, one is in York Street and the other is a little covered alleyway directly opposite the junction of Fore Street and New Street. It was a little tricky to find the first time but it is worth making the effort. 
The courtyard and the café are step free but there is loose gravel flooring in the courtyard. The table and chairs are free standing."
995,A 5 star service to help you
996,"Hampton Inn, the former name of this American brand group of hotels, which offer moderately priced hotels, with just the basic needs on offer.The chain was first founded in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1999, the owners Prius hotel corporation was bought by Hilton Worldwide for $3.5 million dollars. And in December 2019, the chain included 2544 hotels in 30 countries, 
with its first UK hotel opening in 2009.
This Oxford hotel opened in 2016.

It is certainly handy for Oxford, which is just a short 15 minute drive away, and it has excellent motorway connections for London and Birmingham. The hotel lies south of Oxford, right on the outskirts, and very handy if you are a football fan. The stadium for Oxford United, Kassam stadium, is named after the owner Firoz Kassam, and is situated just across the road from Hampton Hilton hotel, in an area well suited for families, as next door is the Hollywood bowl, which in itself is just a typical bowling alley. And there is a Frankie and Bennys restaurant next to this.

We personally were not impressed by its location, as close to a sewage treatment works.
This is a simple basic budget type hotel, but very clean and well looked after, with just as much facilities as is needed, no frills, but good value for what is on offer here.
Your day starts with a good buffet hot breakfast, then you can use its 24 hour fitness room, there’s an on site snack and drinks hub, handy after a workout, and of course it has free parking, but do register at the desk.

OUR REVIEW.
We arrived at an industrial site, which here held the 0xford United football ground, and a bowling alley, with the hotel tucked away in a far corner (photo 1) plain looking and typical budget style. 3 disabled bays stood next to main entrance (2) with an automatic entry door, on the flat (3).
We sat in the breakfast and evening dining area (4) plain simple deco and furniture, but very clean and well looked after.”
The reception desk was maned, which acted as the bar and hot drink counter as well (5) were we enjoyed a very nice cup of hot chocolate each (6). 
A small more comfortable lounge area (7) ideal for a quick sit down and rest, while the hallway area leads off to toilet and bedrooms (8) where a disabled toilet was available (9) with its wider door. The toilet was quite spacious, clean, nicely tiled, with pull cord and grab rails (10), and modern fixtures (11).

Off the hallway are typical bedrooms (12) with tea making facilities (13) TV, and wardrobe ect, while the bathroom was very pleasant, smallish, with a shower unit, which had a small step to get up (14) but with usual pull cord and grab rail.  The bed itself was a tidy King Size bed, Comfortable looking, and just about enough room to struggle into bed. (mind you, this may have not been a disabled bedroom, the young foreign speaking cleaning lady did not fully understand what we wanted to see.)
Next to bedrooms is a door for the fitness centre (16) but very small and with limited equipment (17).

Beyond the hotel itself, just a few yards away, stood a Hollywood Bowl centre (18) and next to this a Frankie and Benny restaurant (19) and across the car park stands the Oxford United football ground (20).

OUR FINAL THOUGHTS
A Plain simple budget type hotel, very clean and well looked after, ideal for a quick overnight stay, especially if you are sporty types, and a family.
We were not impressed ourselves with the surrounding area, but if this is the type of budget hotel you require, then we would recommend this hotel, because of its cleanliness and appearance."
997,There isn't close by parking near The Garage nightclub so would probably suggest taking a taxi to avoid a long walk to the club. 
998,Bus links and several public car parks near by
999,"After not turning up to do the job we made attempts to calll both of the men runningbthe project which were never answered. 
I had a hole dug across my lawn for a drainage and has now left thr garden unusable for my chair."
1000,Wheelchair and mobility scooter friendly park but not all activities accessible .
1001,"Small theatre renovated to modern standards . Loved the atmosphere, and the history of the venue .Most areas are accessible."
1002,"There is no parking in St. Andrews Square during the event but plenty parking in the adjacent Streets, especially after 18.30 when the pay parking restrictions end, the Tram stop is on the East side of the Square plus 4 bus stops with a wide range of services, for buses from further afield, the Bus Station is near the Tram stop. Waverley  Station is 5 minutes away below Princes mall."
1003,"We were surprised to find tucked away in a corner a fabulous accessible toilet. Access was via a RADAR key and a notice on the door giving instructions where to get help if you didn't have a key. It was beautifully warm, very spacious, and well appointed."
1004,There is a staircase of 8 steps to enter the building. There is a stair climber but it cannot be used in wet or icy weather. Once inside there is a lift to get to the first floor. The exhibition rooms are spacious and there is room to move about. The café is along a corridor and there are 2 other rooms for people who are having refreshments to sit. There are free standing table and chairs.
1005,You can park on Fochabers high street right beside eats and treats.
1006,"Plenty staff and aware of different needs, on hand to assist with out of reach items, their service at check out, in the florist and stationary info desk was excellent. A bit of good fashioned service."
1007,"The Opera House which dates back to the 1880s, is ornate and opulent. I went to attend a ballet performance."
1008,"The cinema is on two floors, downstairs the seats are four around a table, upstairs it is traditional cinema seating. The seats around tables are very comfortable and swivel so that they are accessible to people who have disabilities. Wheelchairs can be placed by the ramp if not needed for seating during the film. This is a very popular cinema built in the 1930s, closed in 1988 then refurbished and re-opened in 2004."
1009,Only at one end of the pub and could do with refresh.
1010,"Hotel Entrance:
The path and streets outside the hotel are extremely smooth and clean as well as kerb cuts. The main entrance is completely wheelchair accessible and all level with no steps. There are automatic doors into the hotel and reception area. 

Reception/Lobby:
There was lots of space to move around in my wheelchair. Unfortunately there wasn't a lowered check-in desk. Guests check themselves in by using the self-check in tablets. The buffet breakfast area is spacious and there is a range of tables and chairs with a lovely green garden that you can sit out in, which is also accessible. 

Room:
Our accessible room had twin beds and although the room was lovely and modern, it was slightly on the small side. The beds were incredibly comfortable though - BEST bed I've slept in while away from home. Although the room was small, I was still able to move around in my wheelchair, but it was tighter than I'd like from an accessible room. I loved the modern features though."
1011,"Two entrances, both up a good few steps, outside beer garden though which is one level and nice on a sunny day."
1012,"There is an adapted toilet at dress circle level, an staff will assist with access, but I didn't use this. There is one toilet cubicle on the foyer level which is not accessible which I used."
1013,Bus is great from the station only thing is on street parking on a hill 
1014,Wheelchair accessible through the side entrance. Once inside a ramp takes you up to the upper restaurant that level. I'm only able to fit my wheelchair underneath table 6 though!! Disabled toilet is a little challenging but feasible
1015,Very friendly and keen to help.
1016,"The staff are amazing! Without the helpful staff this could be quite a stressful experience. They are super helpful, walking ahead and clearing space through people so you can get in and out, and use the toilet. There are lots of staff about wearing jackets that easily identify them. They are really polite and friendly. "
1017,There are ramps throughout the ground floor of this 800 year old building making it completely accessible for a wheelchair user.  There are plenty of pews where you can stop to take a rest.
1018,The Wallace Collection is conveniently located in Central London. We were staying nearby so just tootled along - but it’s not too far from major transport routes.
1019,Emotionless and unhelpful
1020,"Me, my husband, his mobility scooter, our son, his lady, their dog.  An overcast day but surprisingly warm.  We had a lovely walk: plenty of the park was accessible to the scooter and we easily made it to the first and last house for icecream.  "
1021,"I would have given five stars for the staff  as they were really helpful, did not rush us or make us feel rushed. Nothing was too much trouble.
Once we had the disabled ride pass just getting the pass  was ridiculously difficult and pc gone mad tbh
The guy who pushed my daughter round and round in a big police car was fantastic, his rapport with my daughter was so sweet."
1022,"It was my first time being at Kynoch Park since I started using my mobility scooter and it was a fantastic day apart from me getting sunburned. I was going to walk into the match as I wasn't sure how I would manage my scooter in the ground, but I decided to take my mobility scooter and write a review and I wasn't disappointed. 


We parked opposite the ground so we only had a 2 minute walk to the gates Then I asked the guy at the turnstiles how I could get in and I was expecting the usual running about asking people where I go but he beamed a smile at me and told me to wait a second so he could open the gate to let me through. I then paid my ticket and then I was immediately greeted by the Keith FC chairman (I think) who welcomed me to Kynoch Park. After a quick chat he took me round by the entrance and onto the pitch so I was sitting with my Granda. Great game (5-0 to ICT), great weather and a great club.
My nose started to bleed AGAIN so the Keith FC chairman panicked and shouted on the physio haha ""Haud in there san"" the phisyo treated me like I had broke my leg :)

I feel like I should try and go back and give Keith some support, just as a way to say 'Thank you'


I think that highland league clubs maybe don't have the finances to build a whole new state of the art wheelchair accessible shelter but they do the best with what they've got, and Keith is a credit to the highland league!"
1023,"Smallish venue, unable to get close enough to the tables although my electric scooter is very large.  Everything I needed was on one level."
1024,Everyone was friendly and accommodating.
1025,The staff are friendly and are helpful 
1026,"We parked in the 11 disabled bays available, as described in part one, ( and it has a lot to say about parking here, so please read part one)"
1027,"Good sized , clean and even had a red cord that reached the floor! "
1028,"The wide, glass double doors were propped open due to the heat, & a waiter met us at the door. We were lead through the perfectly level restaurant to a suitable table, where I was asked which side was most convenient for my wheelchair & chairs were moved without a fuss. All of the tables were of a suitable height to be accessed from a wheelchair, & even the booth-style tables on the left of the restaurant had space to pull up a wheelchair is so desired. There was plenty of room to move between furniture, necessitated by the trolleys they use to serve food.
The food & service were equally as good."
1029,They have ramps to the cinema screens which are slightly higher than the others on the left of the cinema. The only trouble I have is the counter tops tills are a tad high for me to be able to use plus all the concession stands either side of the counter tops make it difficult to try to turn around in a mobility scooter to try to get closer to the tills. 
1030,Not really accessible as the main attraction is out of bounds.
1031,"With 6 bays available for disabled, and everything to see and do on the level, it was very nice. No steps for us to worry about as a lift is available to get us up to disabled toilet and into bedrooms, although the lift seemed narrow, and a large chair may struggle to get on.  Plenty of seating areas for a light snack or drinks."
1032,"I visited this venue in a wide wheelchair, level access and lifts to all floors. Spacious toilets. Parking on site is excellent. Stewards and volunteers so helpful. The seating is excellent, a flap down seat next to the space for the wheelchair. Reasonable ticket price and carers ticket was free. Been to 3 venues during RWC 2015, this was the best of the 3."
1033,"Level access through the door. All doors are light and fairly wide. Like any cafe, some areas are tighter packed with tables but overall it was one of the more spacious cafes I have seen. The tables are slightly awkward for wheelchairs because of the design of the table legs. "
1034,All staff were friendly and helpful 
1035,See picture
1036,"Great staff, very helpful and informative. Even helped with some ideas for wheelchair height gardening."
1037,"I feel like accessibility was an afterthought. 
A few inch step into the cafe. 
Only accessible to those in a very slim manual chair, but not if it's busy as there isn't much room inside. Would be difficult for assistance dogs to lay under the tables or nearby.
I have a Quickie Helium (42cm seat width & 3 degrees camber), I could only just fit in through the front door & navigate through the cafe."
1038,"easily accessible with blue badge parking outside entrance to art gallery. hard floors and lift to upper floor and helpful invigilators who are knowledgeable about the displays.
good loos on the first floor, automatic and wide doors at entrance and a cafe that is also accessible and light snacks or meals. Shut on Mondays except in school holidays."
1039,You really have to drive to this location
1040,"There was an accessible toilet which was a pretty good size. It had grab bars/rails, space for my wheelchair and an emergency pull cord. We had to untie the cord, but in a way I can see why it was tied up as it was very close to the fold-down rail and could easily be pulled by mistake. We untied the cord and added a Euan's Guide card to it. "
1041,"There are dropped kerbs at each side of the B&Q entrance, you enter through one side and exit at the other side. Both doors are automatic. Outside the entrance and exit there are rope barriers and signs to help for queuing due to the pandemic, but I don't feel any of them were in the way.

As I entered the garden centre area of B&Q there was a sign at the entrance of the automatic door, I could have been moved but i did manage to get past it.

I visited later on in the evening so it was quiet, but I feel the aisles would be quite narrow if people are coming each way and trying to social distance. There were some obstructions in the way of some aisles, including a step ladder on wheels that staff possibly use to stock shelves and some cardboard stands that were blocking the ends of some aisles I think to help with social distancing as they go out on to the area where people queue at the tills.

I'd say the tills are a little bit too high to reach for wheelchair users but when I visited the staff member scanned my items in the trolley."
1042,"The Red Squirrel Trail is accessible and as a powerchair user, I found the paths manageable. Most of the trail is flat, but there are some gentle slopes throughout which may be slightly more difficult for manual wheelchair users or people with walking difficulties. However, the trail is rated as 'easy' by the Forestry Commission.

There are picnic benches scattered throughout and I was pleased to see that they had a cut out to allow wheelchair users to sit at the table too. Definitely taking a picnic the next time. "
1043,"Taxis are booked via phone. Majority of the wheelchair accessible vans are rear access, similar in style to Citroen Berlingo or Peugeot Partner. My Q700m including headrest fits in these taxis.  I'm not sure how many vehicles they have suitable for wheelchairs but there seems to be a lot. You can pay by card, they send a text to your phone with a link to pay."
1044,Helpful.
1045,"Each of the levels are linked through escalators and lifts, therefore allowing easy access to get the on the level of your choice. Around the centre, there are various sofas which individuals can sit on if they are needing a rest or feeling tired and there is also a large amount of tables and chairs within the food court that the public can sit at.  All the entrances to the centre on the ground floor are all wheelchair accessible."
1046,"The area I sat at is fairly accessible with movable chairs and level access. It was fairly quiet with low background music. There is another area of seating which does not have level access, so worth specifying if you require level access when you book. There is one high table but most seating options are at a lower level.
There is table service. "
1047,Toilet is fine it’s in a wet room so there is space to get a wheelchair in (although we don’t need to use accessible toilet) 
1048,All the facilities at Touchbase are really accessible and fantastic.
1049,"The food and drinks were delicious, a great place to go if you are in the mood for some margaritas"
1050,"There is a lift to the spacious basement, but it's tucked away in a remote corner of the ground floor, I couldn't find any signage to tell me where it was, the lift buttons made no sense - a random assortment of unlabelled discs, some of which were buttons, some weren't: really baffling. 

BEWARE when you exit the lift in the basement floor. Because the lift is quite small, a wheelchair user is likely to enter the lift forwards on the ground floor, and leave the lift backwards in the basement. If you leave the lift backwards, BE VERY CAREFUL because if you go a few inches too far you will tumble backwards down a set of steps just in front of the lift. I cannot believe that anyone actually decided that this ridiculous and dangerous set-up was OK! 

NB there is a ramp running down from the basement lift doors to the shop floor (on the left-hand side of my photo, not clearly visible), so these steps are not an accessibility issue: they are simply a *safety* issue because they are placed so dangerously close to the front of the lift. I very nearly tumbled down them backwards myself, because I didn't know they were there as I emerged backwards out of the lift.

Some display tables are positioned so close together that it is impossible for a wheelchair-user to move between them, which means that in practice many bookshelves are inaccessible. It's very hard to get around the tiny narrow gaps in the layout of this bookshop"
1051,Staff are very helpful.
1052,"We struggled - which was unexpected and disappointing. Cobble stones up to entrance were very bumpy which my little girl found highly amusing fortunately, but may be very uncomfortable for adults or people who have pain.  

There are lifts and ramps - but very few automatic doors. Really difficult getting through them and I am walking so could open them, a wheelchair user on their own may well struggle. 

Exhibits, information signs and buttons to make things work were all fairly low and reachable which was good. "
1053,Staff friendly and helpful.
1054,I applied for wheelchair tickets to the autumn tests. These are decided by ballot. I was allocated 2 tickets ( one for me and one for a carer) These cost £13.50 each (normal tickets cost up to £70). I was also given a carpark space. This is in the ice rink carpark right next to the stadium. The carpark fills up quite quickly so it's best to go early. Our tickets were trackside so we had fantastic views. They were very easy to access. The stadium has great disabled toilets - these were manned by staff to stop them being used by non disabled people . 
1055,The are 3 disabled parking spaces outside the Maid of the Forth ticket office
1056,"Plenty of seating around the park. Lots of hills and 65 acre site.  Paths are mostly tarmac but some gravel and uneven surfaces. Some information signs are a little high for wheelchair users and smallish print.  The cafe at the moment is a bit tight for space, but this is to change.   Doorways to the shop is really heavy.  The cafe doors open out and difficult solo."
1057,Staff were very friendly and helpful. Offered to help me with the buffet if I needed it. Service was excellent.
1058,There is no available seating out side the store or within however seating could be provided when asking a staff member. There is no braille outside or within the store.
1059,Staff are very accommodating of a disabled person and were more than willing to provide support and advice when requested
1060,Street parking available.
1061,Accessible toilet available but not visited.
1062,Automatic main door. Internal doors wide enough for wheelchair access. Plenty of space to move around with good floor finish for wheelchairs.
1063,"Our driver was James Elijah. He was first class, friendly and helpful and made sure I could see the best views from my seat as I could not get out of the taxi at viewing spots. So good we have booked James to take us on Paris tour next trip. "
1064,The staff member that served us was incredibly helpful. They utilised the menu options on the glass counter to point to and aid our individuals to choose and identify their choice of bread and sauce independently. The staff member was very patient and ensured our individuals correctly gained the sandwich they desired by verbally addressing some of the salad options available rather than leaving our customers to struggle to see over into salad boxes. 
1065,Level access from street and interpretation centre spacious and well equipped with large lift.
1066,Signage is written and reasonably clear.
1067,"Generally not bad. Most central shops here have a step at the entrance, but Specsavers staff have tried to improve access.

Staff are very helpful."
1068,"Staff were very helpful throughout, and quite knowledgeable too. They were also empowered to provide authorization for  more specialized requests, such as driving through the forest, driving to the castle, and driving up to the historic house. "
1069,Only one on the site plus one in the cafe. Red cords were tied up. One too long. One too short. Unfortunately I didn't have cord cards to attach. Photos below.
1070,"Del amo fashion mall is located on Hawthorne Blvd. It has numerous car parks with ample amount of disabled parking at each car park. Most people drive to the mall, hence the 12,000 parking spaces, however several busses also stop at the mall.  The car parks are large allowing easy parking access for those who travel in large size vehicles. "
1071,Very helpful and aware .
1072,Limited parking on the Royal Mile.
1073,"Lee house manager very helpful, with the back up of Representative Nicole. Everything covered and we felt secure and confident"
1074,We were advised to drop our group off at the rear entrance of the venue. There was a lift available although most of our group were able to manage the small flight of stairs.
1075,"Once onboard the ferry, the access for the wheelchair was really good. The lift that takes you up to reception, cabins and bar and restaurant decks was a good size, able to fit a wheelchair and a couple of people with carry on luggage.
There is a good amount of space to move about the different areas, although the corridors are quite narrow.
The cabins were an adequate size, . We had two single beds in our cabin with a space for the wheelchair to get in between both, although once you were in the cabin you would just get the wheelchair in and transfer onto the bed. The toilet  was good with grabrails either side and a good sized roll in shower.
In the public areas, if you decided not to have a cabin, you could have one of the comfortable seats, although due to the length of the journey my preferred option was to have the accessible cabin. Also in the public areas there was good sized accessible toilets and also a good sized accessible shower room with roll in shower.
In the bar area there was a good amount of space to move around as there was in the Magnus Lounge where we had our meals. One small thing to note that may be an issue for customers with a visual impairment is the small hooks on the floor which are there to tie down the chairs as sometimes the crossing on the North Sea can be quite choppy. I also noticed there was a small cinema room showing movies, but unfortunately I did not have time to investigate. There was also a Shop that I had no problem navigating myself around with the wheelchair."
1076,I went to a family party at the Opal Restaurant and really enjoyed the openness of the facilities and the accessible toilet - however the lock does need fixed!
1077,"Our 2nd time of staying at Brickhouse , and we've already booked for next year.
Plenty of room for the whole family , including Personal Assistants.  Every bedroom is ensuite and all the facilities are first class. Having a ceiling hoist  for the hot tub outside is the cherry on the cake. My lot  enjoy the fishing lake , but having the swimming pool is fantastic too. 
The owners employ family and friends and everybody is lovely , nothing is too much trouble. It is a  really lovely place to stay."
1078,"The park itself is very accessible to me in a powerchair, but do be aware that the paths are gravel and there are a couple of fun cambers. There are also big wooden fences that seem custom made to be just the right height to block my view, but the animal enclosures are huge, and you will always find a good view point. 
This is not a good place to try to tackle without wheels if you have mobility or energy  issues. They usually have limited wheelchairs available for use, but not during Covid, so come prepared."
1079,"One disabled parking space at the Employment Academy, the building the cafe is in. Otherwise there is some on street parking further up Havil Street."
1080,The ticket agent and bus driver were both great. They were friendly and helpful. Driver explained how the wheelchair securement system worked and was happy to help activate it for me as I was unable to lift my arm up to push the button. 
1081,"I have always had excellent service from all the staff. Yes, they are always busy but they are very helpful, especially if you require passenger assistance service. When you arrive at the Customer service point you book in with your Passenger Assist reference number and a member of staff looks after your luggage and loads you onto the train with the wheelchair ramp. They also meet your returning train and assist you with going to the taxis etc."
1082,"Very large and clean but there was a bin in the transfer space (hence I knocked a star off). Doesn't have a RADAR lock. 
They appeared to have one in the gents and one in the ladies."
1083,"Level access throughout lower floor and into auditorium.  With advanced arrangements seating can be made available for  wheelchair users at front of auditorium.
Lift access to upper floor studio and workshop."
1084,"The signs throughout the palace grounds were very clear and access to the main information area was easy, via both steps & a ramp."
1085,It was possible to park directly outside to drop off and pick people up but there is no disabled parking.
1086,This converted farm has easy access to site and cottages and is very thoughtfully furnished and equipped
1087,The staff were great despite there not being too many of them. It was a fairly busy time of day so I really appreciate the time that they took to help me and ensure that I felt welcome.
1088,"When in Washington D.C. we went to the Lincoln Memorial. It was wheełchair accessible (more details later). It was busy but there was enough room to move around. The sun was shining and from the memorial we got an amazing view of the reflecting pool and Washington monument. There is a small area beside the lift with information about the history of the memorial and Lincoln. (see photos)
"
1089,"The disabled toilet has enough space to move around with a carer but has a small threshold step to get into. 
There is a pull down hand rail. 
It is shared with baby changing and being a family orientated attraction there can be a VERY long wait to get into there.
There is not a changing places toilet.
"
1090,"We visited the toilets, it was a standard disabled loo (ie no changing bench), there was a baby change unit with a maximum weight of 25kg which is what we used."
1091,"The hotel has excellent disabled access. It had the usual facilities you would expect to find in a Premier Inn hotel restaurant, bar area and there was also a Costa Coffee. The communal areas were step free, with lifts. 

I had reserved an accessible room with walk in shower and when I arrived I was allocated what I had requested and I was pleased with the layout and cleanliness of my room.

The hotel although a little bit out of the main city centre has excellent public transport links, which made the location very easy to get to.

The only thing which I felt could be improved upon was the queuing, when I arrived the machine didn't accept my booking, there was a queue at receiption and I had to stand about 5 - 8 minutes before I was served. When I got the receiption I suggested that they have some fold up seats so people with mobility impairments can join, but don't have to stand in the queue. Likewise in the morning queuing for breakfast at the restaurant. These were little things that could make things a lot better for disabled customers, but it wouldn't put me off returning. "
1092,"What a wonderful holiday - wish we were still there. Private heated pool has grab-handle near the steps,  and it certainly made a difference getting in and out of the pool. Actually I noticed that everybody was using it and not just me!

Another thing which we found useful was a couple of small plastic stools in the villa. I found these helped me get into the bath/ shower. One also was very useful to me in climbing into large hire car - in fact we took it around with us!
Villa Athena is classed as limited mobility friendly, it has 2 bedrooms on ground floor, a large heated private pool, and the surrounding area is flat as it is sea level. There is decking access onto Coral Bay beach. This villa has some lovely shaded spots too in case the sun gets too much."
1093,"Toilet was male/female/disabled.  Double door allowed wheelchair access.  One support handrail, right side"
1094,"Approach the main entrance via the Mall, from the bottom of the Duke of York's Steps, where you can glide onto the pavement. The entrance to the building is step-free, with automatic doors. Most areas inside the ICA are step-free and accessible. There is a platform lift down to the sunken exhibition area. Both cinemas are wheelchair-accessible, but if you want to watch a film in Cinema 2, you will be placed at the very front, too near the screen. The wheelchair space in Cinema 1 is further back. There is no wheelchair access to the upstairs bar, which is a major disappointment, though there is a small bar annex at the foot of the stairs, and staff/friends can bring you drinks there: but it's a very poor substitute for being able to join everyone else in the real bar."
1095,Very friendly. Very helpful
1096,"The museum is housed in a former home with traditional architecture with an open air courtyard. There is a ramp at the entrance to the museum. The museum itself is on 2 floors with the upper floor being accessible by stairs or a lift. There was a basement room, which is open to the public but I was unable to access due to the stairs. There was another lift from the courtyard to the shop/ exit.  Then one shallow step from the shop to street level. Overall I was very impressed and surprised with the installation of lift given that it is a historic property. There were cards in each of the rooms in different languages telling you about the things in the room but I was not aware if they did large print or braille."
1097,"Car park is shared with Buchanan Galleries (Shopping Centre). (2 -3 minute walk outside)
Located 5 minutes walk away from Queen Street station. Central station is about 10 - 15 minutes walk away. However, both station would require an uphill journey to the venue. 
Buchanan bus station is located across the road with frequent bus routes from all over Scotland. 
"
1098,Nice and quite helpful
1099,"Friendly staff, enthusiastic about the Countryside Mobility organisation that they belong to"
1100,"This venue is a little out of the way in Ashington Northumberland - but it is well worth it!

Bus - the nearest major Bus Station is around 15 minutes walk away in Ashington - sadly no public transport is available directly to the venue - but there is a reduced rate from Ashington Taxis.
Ashington Station has links to Haymarket Station in Newcastle (about 40 minutes) - making it easy to get to, and all public transport around the North East should be accessible and include space for at least one wheelchair.

Parking - there are plenty of disabled parking bays on the site, and there is a lot of room in each bay for getting in and out of vehicles. Some parts of the car park were gravel when I visited and may cause some chairs a problem - but it’s not all gravel, and hopefully, it’s a temporary situation."
1101,There is Blue Badge parking near the West Gate of the gardens. There is also metered parking on the surrounding streets which can be used for free by Blue Badge holders. There are also several bus stops nearby.
1102,The disabled access was overall good but can be quite difficult to get through the door as its a manual door and also a high counter makes it hard to order. 
1103,"absolutely nothing was a problem, when I had called to book I had let them know that one of the party was in a wheelchair and they made sure that they put us at a table with plenty of room round it and near to the disabled toilets, with a clear path through."
1104,Very friendly and helpful
1105,Level flooring with no steps means easy access for entrance and also for inside.
1106,Access to the City Art Centre is good and starts from the dedicated door for mobility impaired visitors. A lift takes visitors to all floors and there's plenty of space to move around and see everything.
1107,"Step-free access to the hotel, with lifts to all floors.  The lift was large enough for us and my mobility scooter - but may be cramped for larger scooters, or other large equipment.  "
1108,"The approach to the pub's step-free entrance has nasty bumpy cobbles (one star lost for this). Apart from that, access into the pub is easy and there's plenty of room to move around. Most tables are wheelchair-friendly, beware of those with a cross-bar at floor level, these are wheelchair-UNfriendly but they are a minority among the many tables there. The bar counter is very high so you might want to bring a periscope if you're a wheelchair user. "
1109,Although a small step into the shop. My carer didn’t have an issue getting my wheelchair over this and staff were happy to hold doors open .
1110,"The venue staff were very rude to one of our PAs when she arrived early to check out the access, but the security staff were later very helpful when it turned out that the Box Office had given our party (5 wheelchair users plus 2 PAs) the wrong tickets."
1111,"The Emmerdale Village Tour is the outdoor purpose built village where the outside scenes are filmed for Emmerdale.An excellent 90 minute tour especially if you an Emmerdale fan.Carers are free of charge,it is all mainly accessible with a few slopes and uneven surfaces but overall it is ok,i have a powerchair and managed ok as did others who were  in manual wheelchairs.This is an outdoor attraction so you do really need good weather as there is no shelter if it rains,or a good brolly !!"
1112,"Their accessible facilities include personal care resources, a passenger lift, grab rails, wide corridors and a contrasting decor. An induction loop is available on request.
"
1113,"Everything accessible for wheelchairs and scooters with good cafe facilities and nice views for those unable to travel very far, including a hide right next to the Centre. Visitor Centre with free access to cafe, charge to go on reserve, free for RSPB members. The good news is a big lottery grant means the reserve is expanding!"
1114,Helpful. 
1115,"Road is single track but minibus wide with plenty of passing space. Would benefit from more signage as it's a long way up hill off the main road. There are speed ramps but they are not severe.
Everything is wheelchair accessible. Hoists available. Changing rooms space. Plenty of seating. All tarmac paths. Ramped access where needed to hydrotherapy pool. "
1116,Some friends along with my wife and I went out for my surprise birthday meal to Basil Restaurant in Dunfermline. the staff were fantastic during our visit from start to finish and the food was outstanding. This will be a regular eatery for us from now on.
1117,tour staff all ready and willing to assist to gain the best experience.
1118,"Lovely walk/wheel along the  route of the former railway line. For this one we start and finish at Alsop, stopping at Tissington for refreshments. Dramatic views. Good surface - lightly compacted earth for the main part. No inclines on the trail.. Small hill from former Tissington station then down into village.  We stopped at Herbert's Tearoom s for lunch and loos. "
1119,"There are disabled parking spaces for both staff and students- approximate 5 spaces at the front entrance and three disabled parking spaces at the rear of the school. The bus stop going to nearby places such as Trim, Kells and Dublin are also located right outside the gates of the school. There are also school buses which operate in the morning and in the afternoon. These are then located within 5 mins walk of the school."
1120,"there is the occasional bad seed, and the fact the call for assistance button is still not fixed after years of being faulty is a bad thing, but the staff themselves are overall very helpful, friendly and willing to assist in any way they can. including carrying your luggage to the taxi rank for you."
1121,"The disabled access depends on where the ship is berthed, but the JST always try to ensure that if there is no accessible parking then accessible transport is near and/or the ship is easy to get to with step free access. It's worth noting that getting to the ship may involve a fast boat ride if she's anchored! "
1122,There were two accessible toilets off of Peacock Alley.
1123,"There are steps through the main door, but there is a separate access for wheelchair users."
1124,Well signposted loo with wide door and hand rails
1125,Staff made this trip - they were really helpful and had a good laugh with us too.
1126,The disabled parking area is to the left as you go in the main gates there are a number of spaces. However they could do with a repaint to make them more clear.
1127,"Very pleased to see Chop Chop the chimp, the weather was great."
1128,"This ship is amazing it’s totally accessible.  This is not a cruise though you can expect to be pulling on ropes, being on watch, mess duty, climbing the rigging and keeping the boat clean.  It’s the nearest thing to a equal playing field you’ll get.  I didn’t get much sleep which left me really tired but I took naps when I could.  I’d do it again I’d take sleeping pills  my phone with earphones and plenty audiobooks."
1129,Separate wheelchair door at Untere Weissgerberstrasse side (ring the bell)or level access through cobbled courtyard from Weissgerber Lande. Lift to all levels and very helpful staff. Hundertwasser didn't believe in flat floors so be prepared for interesting slopes!
1130,"There is a large field with a toilet block and pay to enter barriers that is used for parking for visitors to Teapot Island, boaters, people having picnics etc. The field entrance is bumpy but the grass is not so bad - we parked very close to the ramp and bridge that leads to the museum. Parking is also available on the road/ever side  but was very busy. It costs £2-3 per day depending on when you visit."
1131,"Entire centre in wheelchair accessible and spacious. There are wheelchairs to use in the store. I love visiting the restaurant for tea and cake, the tables are at a good height for wheelchairs and it’s very big so even when busy people don’t need to move for me to get through the tables"
1132,Very aware and clear speaking was Rupert's description of what went on in every part of the museum and some very good demonstrations of parts of the jewellery making process. Kept us all interested for a hour and bit about what went on and the history of Jewellery making from the beginning of the factory to present. 
1133,The staff that we met throughout the visit were extremely friendly and very positive. They were quick to answer my questions about the accessibility and to tell me about the alternative accessible toilet. They also suggested that it may be better to drive from the visitor centre to the Burns cottage as it was some distance. Generally the staff and their enthusiasm made for an enjoyable visit which did to a certain extent overcome some of the challenges.
1134,The one in the car park is well equipped and clean. It was not locked.
1135,"2 wheelchairs were available for customer use at enterance
Accessible disabled toilets"
1136,"The toilet is accessible, clean and basic; there is no emergency cord but it is spacious and there are grab rails.  It is also used as a baby-changing facility and it stored a mop and bucket which could be a problem for some people with mobility problems."
1137,"Entrance to the arena reception is via wide automatic opening doors. There is a wheelchair accessible barrier at reception, this is accessed by card but staff at reception can open if needed. They allow 1 carer free to assist only, if needed. There is a lowered counter at reception but no lowered counter at member sign up counter. 

The gym is accessed via a lift as it is on 1st floor. To access gym itself you need to swipe a card or use a fob and the doors are not electronic. Usually there is someone who will help if needed but you can be hanging around sometimes waiting.

The gym equipment itself is aimed at people with different disabilities. Some can be used direct from your wheelchair, others require transferring. They have 3 hand bikes with removable seats which can be used from your wheelchair. I personally found the machines with swing away seats not suitable for my large powered wheelchair as I was too far forward to reach the handles. They do have plenty of cable machines though which can be used from a large powered wheelchair. There machines have bright yellow accents to act as indicators for those with visual impairments where things are. The machines also have ergonomic handles. I found the machines easy enough to use as they are well maintained as the seat height can change to aid with seated transfers.

There are seats dotted all around the arena.

The signs are in large print and also have pictures. There is  hearing loop at reception. "
1138,The gardens of Walmer Castle are quite extensive and well kept. There are pathways running throughout which are mostly smooth. I could get around pretty much everywhere apart from into a former quarry pit which was down some steps and there was no ramp. But I looked down on it from a higher land. Everyone wore masks in the cafe and the doors were open to provide ventilation.
1139,"Nearest tube station is Holborn, but it is not step free. Green Park is the nearest step free tube station. There are several buses that stop close to LSE."
1140,Very friendly and knowledgable. Asked customers at the wheelchair table to move to another location when we came in although we didn't have a reservation. Appreciated the staff asking and the customers agreeing to move!
1141,"This was our 3rd visit to Elderburn Cottages staying in lodge 6 which is the adapted cottage. We have always had a friendly welcome from Anne when we arrive and she is very helpful to the extent she changed a base bed to a frame bed to allow underneath access for our sons hoist and stuck down a rug in main lounge to stop the wheelchair rolling it up,  - excellent service.
 this cottage is spotlessly clean, spacious and well appointed, has 2 bedrooms and open plan lounge/kitchen with also a large wet room toilet which is great for us.
We find Anne keeps to very high standards in the cottages, we particularly enjoy the peace and quiet at this location which along with the no dogs policy makes it more attractive to us.
Location is very convenient for Craigtoun park and to St Andrews with easy drives to the East Neuk.
We have already booked again for august this year so that tells you how much we enjoy our stay at Elderburn and we would highly recommend as being wheelchair friendly."
1142,The building itself is accessible. My problem is with the function room.
1143,Next to the gym on the lower floor was an accessible loo. It followed the high standard of the facilities in the accessible bedrooms. A large doorway to get in and plenty of space to move around.
1144,"Level entrance and step-free throughout. The beds were very near the walls, so getting a chair alongside the bed would be problematic unless it was a very narrow chair like mine. There are plenty of photos on the property's own website and also Handiscover."
1145,Accessible loo was clean and tidy - although the mirror was missing when we visited.
1146,Top marks for the staff. We received a warm welcome and everyone we met was friendly and helpful.
1147,We weren't sure when a fellow guest at our hotel recommend Michael's Restaurant as we'd need good accessibility for my powerchair and the knowledge that there was an accessible loo. What a surprise we got when we arrived!
1148,"In the past, we have found it very difficult to find holiday accommodation that is both wheelchair accessible and sleeps less than 6-8 but we thought that Hoe Grange was worth a try. It was is just superb and great value. The design of the cabins is very well thought through to make them homely and accessible. Felicity and David are very welcoming and also very professional attending to every detail to ensure that you have a trouble-free holiday including providing a profiling bed and a mobile hoist. 

We had also never considered the White Peak District as a holiday destination before and were very impressed with the area too. There is lots to do and, most importantly for us, there are lots of trails (many inter-connected) that are great for walking, cycling and wheelchairs. Once again David and Felicity have thought about this and done much of the research for you to reduce the stress of finding something to do.

We’ll certainly be back! 
"
1149,Toilet was ok but but tricky if on your own.  The door is right next to the ladies toilet and my opening the door nearly caused an accident. But they do offer a free carer ticket so usually I would not be on my own and a carer would be there to avoid a crash!
1150,"Good size main toilet block off this yard with step free access, disabled toilet is around corner with rather uneven cobbles to cross to get to it, but at least there is separate mother and baby room, unusual for NT.
Martin didn't need to use it as main toilets step-free, but all looked good"
1151,"We stayed in this delightful cabin for a week in June 2021. The owner's have created good access with wide doors, all accommodation on one level and a walk in shower. The lounge and kitchen is all one area and very spacious to move around. Outside there are 2 seating areas, both flat and level so easy to walk using walking aids or by wheelchair. It is an incredibly peaceful place to stay, we found the owners really friendly and helpful and felt very safe staying here. Parking right outside the cabin. "
1152,Has its own private car park directly outside with a good amount of accessible spaces. Unsure about getting there via public transport.
1153,"The website advised not to use the postcode but follow the brown signs.  This we did and got there with no bother.

There was a large car park adjacent to the entrance to the museum site which had a number of disabled bays play an ev charging point."
1154,Super helpful and enthusiastic! Restaurant staff who brought food to table seemed genuinely happy & smiley. We didn't need any particular assistance but all the staff we encountered were great.
1155,"The staff are great and are willing to help always, there main priority it for you to have a wonderful time."
1156,"My initial reason for visiting the Birmingham Museum was to see the Staffordshire Hord - the largest hord of Anglo Saxon gold ever found - and it did not disappoint! However, when I got there I was pleasantly surprised at the large amount of other interesting artefacts and displays. The museum joins onto the Birmingham Art Gallery, which is connected via a covered walkway 10 or so meters up in the air. I didn't even realise I had moved from one building to another, although I quickly realised that one visit would not be enough!"
1157,The museum faces the Promenade des Anglais and there is a step entrance to the gardens from there. There are a number of buses that drive along the sea front and top nearby.
1158,"City centre venue in pedestrian area, so no parking available but lots of disabled spaces nearby in St Davids shopping centre.(approx 500m, charge)."
1159,The staff were all very friendly and helpful 
1160,There was a lift to every floor as well as a lift to the stage that is used for performing. As far as i am aware i did nit see any braille in the school
1161,all pretty cool and made to feel v welcome and no overly patronising staff either :)
1162,"You can park on the tarmac out the front of no. 3 and there are two spaces reserved for the Life Academy (3B), which I imagine you can use with prior notification. Buses to Morningside Road. Plenty of space on the tarmac for a taxi to turn."
1163,"Before the extension was built round the side offering level access, there were steps to be negotiated (via a rather rickittty ramp) up the front.  Once inside it is all level access - however there is a lift to the boxes."
1164,"Doune is a small village north of Stirling and getting there may be a bit challenging by public transport but not impossible. The Castle sits along a narrow lane at the edge of the village. A lot of work has been done recently to create a small car park . There is one marked accessible parking bay but be warned that it is not wide so not possible to wheel easily, if at all, alongside your vehicle. I had great difficulty in parking my WAV (wheelchair accessible vehicle) but a friendly steward came along and said it would be fine to park further along in one of the two coach spaces so problem solved."
1165,The disabled parking at Xscape is good with plenty of spaces available.
1166,There is a small uneven step into the restaurant. It is situated on the Main Street in Lerwick so all the buildings are very old therefore there is limited things they can do to change steps etc. There is a ramp available if needed.
1167,"Visiting stonehenge was a hassle free experience and every step of the way was built with wheelchair accessibility in mind. From the easily located accessible toilets, buses with ramp (and friendly drivers) and up till the flat pathways leading to stonehenge were barrier free."
1168,You can either access the pier via the 'top' part or via a lift from the seafront (this'll make sense when you're there!). The pier has level access right along it - but there was a sign up to make wheelchair users aware that because of the 'planked' surface there are sometimes gaps and if you have narrow wheels then you have to pay a bit more attention! There are quaint 'shelters' at points along the pier as well if you want to take a seat. 
1169,"The building gets five stars - it was the Hamburger Bahnhof, a mid 19th century railway station - one of the oldest in Germany. It became a transport museum and since 1996  has been the Museum für Legendary - Museum of Contemporary Art. How many stars the art (mostly post 1960) deserves is a matter of personal taste. We went to see an excellent temporary (until July 2016) exhibition about art in the Nazi era - both the art the regime approved of and the art it labeled as ""degenerate""."
1170,"The Kilted kangaroo is a large and open Australia themed bar in the centre of Stirling. It has a good range of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks as well as good pub food. The staff are very friendly and it has off street parking accessed via the alleyway. There are screens showing sports events and it has an extensive outdoor beer garden area. There is an accessible loo which is spacious however, it did not have a red cord. "
1171,No problems accessing cottage and plenty of room to manoeuvre
1172,"We stopped off here on our way on holiday, to meet my parents for afternoon tea. There is a hotel and restaurant but we wanted to have a look at the little art gallery and sit somewhere pleasant and safe for a cuppa."
1173,There is no parking in the park.
1174,"ramp into building, lift from entrance hall to main pool area and hoist, which all staff have been trained to use, to get into the pool. Sauna may be difficult to enter."
1175,"Barnitts is situated on Colliergate in the centre of York. 
Getting into York there are several car parks in and around the city centre with the train station not being far away.
There are five entrances into Barnitts, all with level access. The main entrance however is best as it has a wide ramp. 
There is no hearing loop system in Barnitts,.
When asked, the shop does discounts for several different charities, not specifically carers. The shop assistant said they would look at the situation and give discounts on a case by case basis. Do ask the staff as they're all very friendly.
There are no toilets in Barnitts however there are many cafe's close such as Nero that have disabled access toilets.
The shop is well sign posted and has a very open plan downstairs with ramps through all sections including kitchenware, gardening and home furnishings.
The shop doesn't have a lift as it's a grade 2 listed building.
"
1176,The staff were friendly and helpful 
1177,"2 Blue Badge bays, on a bus route"
1178,The buses were wheelchair accessible for me as a powerchair user. The driver operated the ramp and in some places this was not required as the kerbs had been raised to be level with the bus entrance. We used a ticket purchased in advance that allowed 7 days (you can get 3 days) unlimited travel on the buses and trams. More information is on the Blackpool Transport website.
1179,Automatic doors into National Park Centre .
1180,"level access from pavement and lots of space outside on pavement for mobility scooter parking 
Good access in front of post box, low railings for tying up dogs"
1181,"The larger screens have a private viewing box at the back of the theatre, which is accessed by a lift. Come out the lift and there are doors off the corridor to each of the larger screens, and there is access to a disabled toilet. We were in screen 1, which has 2 seats and 2 spaces for wheelchairs. Getting to the toilet was so easy and because of the private box, you didn't disturb anyone. The seats are quite low to see over the balcony.
We did go to another screening where wheelchair access was front row and a total nightmare so check in advance!"
1182,If you have a blue badge....cool. Then park then park in the street! 
1183,"Again, very spacious. The only issue is that they are at the end of the store so it is quite a trip from one end of the building to the other."
1184,"As always Crathie Opportunity Holidays did not disappoint. The accommodation was first class with all the equipment ready for us when we arrived. The cottage was a perfect size and although the bathroom was a little tight we still managed. I love the fact that we can get all the equipment needed on-sight and do not have to hire from elsewhere. The staff are extremely helpful and nothing is a bother. We are able to give feedback and meet some of the board and helpers at a weekly get together. The location is fantastic and central for lots of different attractions and towns. Crathie Opportunity also provide a guide in each cottage that means we could plan our days knowing how far places were, what was accessible nearby and what would suit our needs. Very helpful. Would absolutely recommend."
1185,"Another Neatebox trial. 
Great disabled parking near venue. Staff member came forward and introduced herself as I entrred, as I was using Neatebox Welcome app. 
The girl who met me asked if she could help with anything and told me to.just ask at any time. 
Very easy to get around and nice Sunday lunch. The Falkirk Wheel was closed for maintenance which was a bit disappointing. 
Overall a great venue"
1186,Staff were incredibly helpful and kind - will go above and beyond to make sure your visit is seamless and enjoyable. 
1187,"There was a spacious lift. We were in screen 13 and it did not have an access box therefore the accessible seating was at the front, meaning that we were sitting too close to the screen. "
1188,Just request special assistance and you are directed to a lane which ensures ready access to the lift
1189,"Good access from London Bridge station. From the Tooley Street exit, it's easiest to cross the road and head under London Bridge, which takes you to the accessible entrance through the cafe or learning centre."
1190,Staff were really good and quietly moved tables and made space for us once they spotted us coming in. Our group had two powerchair users.
1191,Ramp from carpark . Shop and cafe on one level. Part of the outside seating area is up a step
1192,"Once we arrived it was very easy. The building is step free and there are lifts. There's touch pad entrance doors. They have three wheelchairs in the main entrance hall which people can borrow on a first come first served basis. They have accessible PCs and magnifying equipment. Assistance dogs are welcome.  There is an Induction loop system.
We visited to attend a talk. When we booked one of the questions on the registration form was do you have access requirements. I had replied yes, I have a mobility disability but I'll be ok attending at talk. When I arrived there were 3 chairs in the front row which had a reserve sign on them symbols of  three figures, one with a walking stick, another was pregnant and another a wheelchair user. I was really impressed with this and so unexpected was it at first I didn't realise it that one of the seats had been reserved for me.
On the ground floor by the entrance hall is a book shop. Opposite it is a self service restaurant, open at breakfast and lunch time, and café which is open all day. They are adjacent to each other. There is free standing tables and chairs and there is in addition some outside tables and chairs. 
The exhibition space is also on the ground floor. The space is a large room and there were a couple of chairs were you could sit down. I found it a manageable size. When we visited there was an exhibition on about the Suffragettes. The lighting levels in exhibition are generally low for the preservation of the documents. 
The archives are in their own grounds with paved pathways and open spaces next to a lake with swans and ducks. There is some benches to sit on. 
On follow up visit on 6th February 2018 I noticed There Be Monsters sculpture in the archives garden, near it was an information panel in braille."
1193,Had to park on the street
1194,Accessible to users with wheelchairs and limited mobility
1195,"Our first visit here recently was to see the excellent B52s.
Upon arrival we were greeted by one of the dedicated accessibility staff and after a quick search we were escorted to our disabled area, which was to the far left of the auditorium and at a height that afforded a clear view of the stage  There was full step free access from street to viewing area with no portable ramps to contend with.
We were first to the disabled area and had our pick of where to pitch ourselves; we took up a position at the front of it, about sixty feet from the stage. The disabled area rises towards the back of it so those sat behind us had a good view too; I had to remember not to stand up and strut my stuff!

I took the opportunity to have a look around the auditorium and foyer before the masses descended; it really is a lovely looking venue and has had a sympathetic restoration befitting of its glory days.

The nearest bar to us was probably about forty feet away and although it was quiet to start with, when more people came in a wheelchair user would have had a struggle getting to the bar without taking out a few feet and ankles along the way. I didn't notice a lowered counter at the bar, nor was a 'drinks to your seat' service offered.

The good sized accessible toilet was next to the disabled area, literally fifteen feet away from us. It required a Radar key, preventing it from being abused, and was also being policed by the dedicated staff near to us.

At the end of the concert we didn't have to wait for the crowd to clear as there were exit doors really close to us that led straight outside.
"
1196,Friendly. Professional. 
1197,"A good sized toilet located right next to the box office, enough room to get wheelchair in, carer in, with handlebars to help. "
1198,"Unusual to give a supermarket ten out of ten but this one really does go the extra mile for disabled customers. Parking, easy access, good toilets, a post office, friendly helpful staff."
1199,"From the visitor centre, the route starts on the road. Initially there is a pavement but this soon disappears and the road goes unhill quite steeply. It is narrow so most cars go slowly but care is needed. Just past the houses, you turn right through a gate onto a gravel path. This also goes uphill for quite a way. The whole route is only 1 mile but it feels like more on the way there! 

There are several gates on the route. They can all be opened but the very last one was too narrow for my chair. However, I was able to get close enough to the cliff face and get some really good views. The stream at the end of the route is lovely and my assistance dog thoroughly enjoyed a paddle. 

There are sections where the ground is very uneven, with tree roots and the like. There were also many puddles, as it has rained a lot recently. Puddles are fun though in a mountain trike."
1200,Good disabled parking in two areas - the larger by the entrance & a smaller by the exit. Longacres is only access by car. 
1201,"There are two accessible toilets in the main part of the hotel which were spacious and well adapted. 
 In the hotel room the toilet had grab rails, a lower mirror and sink and emergency red cord. 
 The shower was a roll in shower with grab rails and shower chair. The shower could be detached making it easier for a PA to assist.  The bathroom was very large with plenty of space. "
1202,"As I left to go on this holiday (the first time for 15 years, due to distrust of amenities and false claims regarding accessibility) my mobile hoist broke and upon arrival my wheelchair riser broke; I thought I was doomed, as always.  Much to my delight the quality of provision at Homelands made my visit both possible and enjoyable. It was very homely, clean (no nasty smells), and in a wonderful picturesque setting.  Lots of lovely beaches and eateries within wheelchair distance.  I went close to the beach, not on it. A lovely area to wander the walks and the fishing villages, simply enchanting.  I would encourage anyone, whatever their disability, to try this holiday home.  An extra bonus was the spaciousness.  I didn't have to watch where I was going all the time, didn't have to squeeze through doorways, didn't knock any paintwork or doors - joy oh joy.   The current bathrooms have no baths but future lodges will have that choice.  Thanks to all the team at Homelands, you do a wonderful job."
1203,Level access into and around the shop. Tables suitable for wheelchair access. Good accessible toilet although you have to negotiate the counter queue.
1204,"there is level access throughout the hotel and lifts if required, there is also a lowered bar area for wheelchair uses and the self help breakfast facilities are accessible by wheelchair users."
1205,"There's a level entrance designated for wheelchair users on the Währingerstraße-Volksoper side of the building - you ring a bell and an attendant comes to let you in. Once inside the staff direct you to the wheelchair space and the accompanist's seat, which is directly behind the wheelchair space. The circulating areas are reasonably spacious, with some swing doors to negotiate. In the interval there is a bar in the foyer serving drinks and snacks. We had a clear view of the stage and the sound quality was excellent."
1206,"We visited Drumsmittal Farm for the first time to buy a Christmas tree; we usually buy from a shop in Inverness but this year because of Coronavirus and still not having been inside a shop yet, we decided to give the farm a try. 
 It is situated in an idyllic setting on the Black Isle and that made the trip seem even more special and gave it some Christmas magic.  The trees were freshly cut and situated in a large barn; we were able to access the barn through a larger opening and there was plenty of room to manoevre and distance socially.  The staff member was very helpful, welcoming and understanding about our Covid concerns and advised us re. access and helped us choose a tree.  "
1207,"It is tucked away within the Aston Webb Building of the University of Birmingham campus in Edgbaston, just a few minutes trundle from University railway station.
There is limited blue badge parking on campus. Local buses stop fairly close. "
1208,"Three dedicated blue badge parking spaces (the 3rd is beyond Saddler's Bistro). 

Level entry to restaurant, which is a large, spacious conservatory with stunning views across Lundin Golf Course and Largo Bay to Edinburgh and the Lothians. 

 Three other function rooms - all accessible."
1209,"Wide aisles around the store. Roomy lifts. All signage in large clear Sans typeface, white on black. "
1210,"Majority of staff will go out of their way to help, shame that their training lets them down."
1211,The sea lion trainer was great explaining that they don't perform if they don't want to its their choice which was reassuring. Also one of the keepers that we asked about penguins  spent time explaining how they swim so fast.
1212,Very nice and helpful.
1213,"As far as boutique hotels go this conversion of a cliff top mansion is perfect.  The setting is as near perfect as it can be whether you visit during a stormy January as we did, or on a hot summer's day.    The hotel do not have an accessible room but do have level access to certain rooms, a disabled toilet and have made the restaurant/bar etc as accessible as possible for an old listed building."
1214,"They have done all they can with the venue to make it accessible but because it's a slim old building some of the corridors are quite tight. Ramp from street is good. Entrance door has a push button to open. 
Cinema 1 is accessed via a lift that we just squeezed into. Cinemas 2 and 3 are accessed via a platform lift which isn't great for a powerchair."
1215,"Arrived to find ramps already in place for us (friends had requested already in advance), allowing us easily up the three steps to the front entrance. Swiftly escorted to the dining room, where table space was already prepared with plenty of room around my wheelchair. Lovely meal and exemplary service."
1216,Friendly helpful staff
1217,"The staff were nice and good service, although I didn't need any extra help."
1218,"Several difficulties for wheelchair users at this branch of Carluccio's, it's always frustrating and difficult trying to get into the restaurant and there are difficulties once you're inside. "
1219,Only two disabled parking spaces. But the council plans to close this site and develop it. 
1220,Tiny and not wheelchair accessible. Access from treatment room if required.
1221,"There is a large car park nearby, complete with lifts & plentiful disabled parking. There is also a taxi rank, multiple bus stops, & the train station is about 1 mile away. "
1222,Babbacombe is near Torquay. The nearest railway station is Torquay.  There are buses that stop nearby. There is a car park which is about 5 - 8 minutes walk away.
1223,"The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating, and treat you with the same respect as any other customer. The cats are all friendly and very curious around wheelchairs, and treat you with the usual disdain cats have for everybody. Sooty in particular is very bold and will happily climb all over you in order to satisfy his curiosity."
1224,"The car park by the Nature Centre has accessible spaces. Cost is £3 for parking all day.

If you were getting the bus you would have to walk for about 10 minutes from the nearest bus stop (by Chilwell Retail Park on Nottingham Road/A6005) to the nature centre.

If you wish to get the train to Attenborough its a 15 minute walk from the train station to the Nature Centre (walking along Attenborough Lane, Church Lane and through nature reserve)."
1225,Staff were friendly
1226,"Sadly had to attend a funeral here, accessible building in beautiful, serene surroundings"
1227,No problem whatsoever accessible toilets are quite large and we negotiated with the frame with no problems.
1228,Very helpful and friendly.
1229,Very friendly and talk to you
1230,"Not so sure about parking in this area, nearest is probably Chamber Street or on street parking near Bristo Place. Great for Lothian Buses however, there is a bus stop right outside. "
1231,"Very polite and helpful, quick to act once aware there was an issue."
1232,"We arrived by motorhome, following directions from Google Maps. Don't! Google hasn't got a clue where the parking is, though she may have been taking us to the limited accessible parking at the top of the castle in town.

We aimed towards coach drop off and accessible parking and a helpful member of staff showed us where to park. The walk back up towards the castle was lovely, though mostly uphill and cobbled in places. 

Signage was distinctly lacking! We got a bit lost and nearly went into the gardens instead of the castle but staff helped redirect us."
1233,"Bumpy cobbles on the approach to the building but then a wide, level access. The ground floor is the Alkmaar Tourist Information office - good circulating spaces. There’s a decent sized lift up to the two main levels of the museum. C irculatin spaces in the museum are good and almost all displays are visible and approachable from wheelchair level. Captions are in English as well as Dutch. "
1234,"So supportive, nothing was too much trouble.  Certainly new their stuff."
1235,"Throughout the whole building disabled access is okay but not the best.
"
1236,"Though the centre supplies wheelchairs for visitors, there are significantly more wheelchairs available than there are disabled parking spaces. The garden centre is relatively small (comparing with its Christchurch sister centre) and some corridors are tight for a wheelchair. The cafe is particularly difficult with  tables crammed in to make the most of the small area. There is also a particularly troublesome door between the cafe and outside - heavy door, narrow space and one of those tricky 1cm lips that always catch the front wheels of a manual wheelchair. "
1237,"Sticky Sisters does not have public toilets themselves, instead directing users into the neighbouring Burger King. There is a door between the two shops as they are right next to each other. The tables in Burger King are a little narrow to move through, and the toilets are located next to the queue which can make them awkward to access for everyone at peak times. The toilet itself was a clean, large cubicle with a full length pull cord but no changing facilities apart from baby-changing facilities."
1238,"Very friendly, and knowledgeable about the area.
There to help you, but never in your face."
1239,Very helpful staff.
1240,"Shopper's Parking at Craigleith Retail Park. Can't comment on the parking in Davidson's Mains. Craigleith Retail Park is served by Lothian Bus 38 from the Royal Infirmary via the south side and Balgreen (not at weekends, when you need to alight at the Holiday Inn - see below) . Lothian Buses 41, 42 & 43 connect the city centre with Queensferry Road - get off at the Holiday Inn and you'll be close to the start of the walk, which is just down South Groathill Avenue. From Davidson's Mains Lothian Buses 41 & 42 go back to the city centre."
1241,"As in most Dutch cities, there are few public loos and even fewer wheelchair-accessible loos. In Haarlem you depend on finding restaurants or museums which have them. The train station has an accessible loo but it’s ten minutes’ wheel from the centre and we didn’t sample it."
1242,"An accessible toilet is available in the basement - accessed by lift.  It has grab rails and plenty of space, but also in the basement was a disco.  We were there early on a Thursday evening - it might be much more crowded, noisy and less appealing late on a Friday or Saturday night."
1243,Outstanding staff with nurses on call 24/7. Outstanding customer care.
1244,"a reasonably long ramp at the harbour side and the same at the front, both leading to a completely accessible front door."
1245,"Traditional tea rooms open from morning and serving light lunches, snacks, afternoon tea and lovely selection of home made cakes. Food is ordered at the counter and food/ drink is brought to your table."
1246,"I asked about a Changing Places Toilet and was told that the signage wasn't put up yet that was the reason it wasn't registered with CPs. I managed to find the toilet, a lovely size toilet and had everything you expect to see in a CP toilet. The only down side was it was in departures so no access to visitors to the airport and passengers arriving into BFS could not access the toilet. "
1247,We drove but there is a local regular bus service. Also the train runs from Glasgow central to Maybole where you can then get a taxi or bus 
1248,"You can park right next to your lodge and the reception, swimming pool and Jake's Bar and Restaurant are all minutes away from the lodges."
1249,There is a large car park at the back but when you arrive and depart you can park at the front doors to make life simpler for access for the guest and unloading all equipment. Conceierge are very good at coming out to help take everything to your room. 
1250,Hi there. I am KH. I love all of modes of transport but especially planes. I often look at flight maps on my iPad. One of my favourite things to do in Edinburgh is to get the bus to Edinburgh Airport and to watch flights taking off and landing. Some of my favourite airlines are Ryanair and Emirates.  It is very easy to get to the airport on the bus. The facilities at the airport are very disability friendly. I could sit and watch the planes out of the big windows for hours!
1251,"Staff very friendly & lovely vegetarian & vegan food! Were able to accommodate dietary requirements such as low fibre or gluten-free! 
Looked like they had a lot of elderly regulars with mobility scooters who parked them outside."
1252,"There are adequate disabled access at the estate with ramps almost to all the sites. There are only a few stairs at the site. There is ramped access to the shop and automatic doors. The entrance to the tea room is level with clear open space. There is also a lift  that provides access to all floors for wheelchair users, however, electric wheelchairs are not allowed in the house and pushchairs cannot be pushed around the house.
Meanwhile all of the grounds, gardens and walled gardens are fully accessible. Push wheelchair users might struggle on some of the areas like the Home Farm and the Stables courtyard. Many trails and walks are accessible but steep in parts. 
Note that Electric wheelchairs must be left outside the tea rooms and Estate Office. 
A manual wheelchair is however available at the entrance of the house to borrow during visit. Unfortunately wheelchair users are not offered assistance around the house. The Estate Office can be contacted on (011)33367560 to book manual wheelchair and terrain mobility scooters to use outdoors. Entry to the Temple Newsam is free for carers."
1253,"The staff are friendly and welcoming, and are very accustomed to dealing with disabled people. This includes the occasion on which the lift was out of order; entry was diverted through the café, where security staff could see anyone disabled and provide them with access to the security lift. I was not made to feel as if I were an inconvenience to them, despite the lengthy efforts they had to go to."
1254,"Plenty of space, and elegant. Everything works perfectly. The owners designed everything with an Occupational Therapist and physio. And it really shows!"
1255,"There is parking across the road in the car park. In summer it is pretty busy though!

Not sure about public transport."
1256," A welcoming local pub, serving home cooked meals with a friendly atmosphere.  The staff were polite and accommodating throughout the visit. Disabled parking is provided adjacent to the beer garden to the rear of the pub where disabled access can also be located.   "
1257,"The were no steps at the main entrance. The doors were closed on arrival and they are not automatic. The menus are on the tables, the cakes are displayed clearly at the counter, although at busy time this might be difficult to access. The cafe is on different levels but the majority of the tables are on the ground floor. Customers order and pay at the counter. Staff are friendly. "
1258,"To get to the accessible toilet you need to go past all the tables, which as I’ve said it may be a little difficult to get to in a wheelchair if all the tables are busy. The accessible toilet is spacious at Costa Coffee and I imagine there would be plenty of space for a wheelchair user and someone to assist them. I would say the only thing is that the toilet is nearer the left-hand side of the toilet and there isn’t enough room between the wall and the toilet for someone to transfer at that side, therefore you are only able to transfer at the right-hand side. 

In this toilet they had a sign beside the red cord to tell customers to be careful when pulling it because staff will enter immediately. I’ve never seen this for a red cord before, but I think its really good make sure customers don’t pull it if they don’t know what it’s for. Although the writing is a bit small for customers to read.

There is no Changing Places toilet near this Costa Coffee."
1259,A well equipped and spacious loo combining baby changing. What a pity there does not appear to be a changing places toilet (it might have been hidden away). It has lost a star as the red cord was tied firmly to the hand rail. Preventing both the rail from dropping and the alarm from activating. I issued them a red card. 
1260,"I had called ahead before I booked on line to make sure it was suitable for wheelchair users and the girl was very helpful, contacting the tour guide to double check and getting back to me quickly. The tour guide was great, he really knew his stuff!!"
1261,Good size large car park. Two disabled parking spaces but the car park is mostly even or flat. There are bus stops nearby with regular service.
1262,The accessible loo is very easy to find. There is a toddler-sized changing mat.
1263,"The toilet was spacious and very clean.
"
1264,"Flanders Moss is easily accessible, a short walk from the car park brings you to the 1km boardwalk around the Moss. There are information boards and displays about the history of this fascinating site.  

Explore this exciting habitat at any time of year, you'll find frogs and toads in spring, lizards and adders in summer, geese in autumn and winter. And you can get onto the moss with the all abilities circular path and boardwalk, which takes you out onto the bog in safety and without damaging this fragile habitat.  The viewing tower (7m) provides a panoramic view across the moss and surrounding landscape."
1265,"Entrance great. Lift great, Access in and around great. Then you got to Screen 2 and the wheelchair spaces are right at the front. This means that you get a serious crick in your neck! My pal is a regular there and informs me that some of the other screens are much better and have wheelchair spaces at the back which is much better."
1266,"There's a wheelchair ramp to the left of the main entrance, another ramp down into the atrium and from the atrium a lift to all floors. The displays are well spaced out and easy to navigate."
1267,Automatic doors and ramps. 
1268,"Disabled parking bay is directly in front of entrance. If there is a rarity that it is full you are able to park next to Brewer's Fayre, into the Premier Inn disabled parking bay."
1269,"The staff were helpful and understanding. The phone on my camera could not register with the track and trace app, but the guy taking the tickets was great. He directed me to the till, where I signed in my name and phone number."
1270,Every stage was accessible.
1271,"This is a fairly new venue and has been thoughtfully designed.  My husband cannot walk well and mobility scooters can be hired for £10 a visit if you do not own one.  The car parking is not far from the main entrance and is a flat path to the main door.  However, the whole site we found to be accessible.  Even though we visited in December, the gardens still had plenty of interest with wide flat paths and wide-open views, even so near a city.   The wilder area was accessible for the mobility scooter but may be a little difficult with a wheelchair.  However, there is plenty of space and garden area to roam about without needed to go further out into the parkland.  The entrance area, shop and cafe are all open-plan with plenty of space for wheelchairs and scooters to move about.  This made it easy to visit the shop and cafe.  The cafe was excellent with lovely food both for carnivores and vegetarians.  It is possible to park and just visit the cafe and shop without paying for the entrance to the gardens.  The toilets are in the main open-plan space.  Staff were helpful.   Highly recommended for a day out.  We went by car so I cannot comment on public transport to the venue."
1272,Disabled parking bays were fairly close to the front door.
1273,"Access is via  two wide double doors these were open during our visit there are then around 4 steps to the main pier level however there is a ramp to the left of the stairs to give you access. This area has a range of machines and you will be unable to get past some of them due to lack of space between them.  
However if you stay on the route through via the ramp you can access most of the area in around about way there is a lot of noise and flashing lights which is not suitable for many people."
1274,"I found the staff to be very friendly, approachable, helpful and disability aware during my visit which contributed to my good experience of the museum."
1275,There are parking spaces for Blue Badge holders adjacent to a path adequate for mobility scooters 
1276,"Entrance is through a lightweight, but non-automatic door, where there is a slight nuisance of a divider which forces you to turn either left or right as you walk into the pub. I assume this is to keep drafts away from customers, which is great, but it may make for a slightly tight turn if you are using a wheelchair or powerchair. 

Once inside, you are greeted by a member of staff who will seat you. Chair types are mixed, with lots of easy to move armchairs dotted around tables - leaving a good amount of space for wheelchair users to sit. It's all table service which is great! 

The pub isn't too dark or loud which is good, and there is a nice cosy fireplace for the winter months. 

If you do want to go out to the beer garden, a single door right beside the accessible toilet pushes open easily (it's a fire exit style door) and you come straight to a ramp and a small set of steps where there is a cheery row of colourful beer beach huts and tables. The ramp takes you right up to the beer garden where you can either choose to sit at the tables on the astro-turf, or head inside one of the huts. They are all open at the front, no doors to negotiate, but the tables in the centre of each are very sturdy and would be difficult to move. This means if you are a wheelchair user, you would need to position your chair on the outer side of the hut with your back to the beer garden - which may be a bit chilly in winter months, but right in the middle of the action in the summer months! Plus you don't have far to travel to the accessible toilet."
1277,"The wheelchair loo (not a changing places loo) is in the basement and is well-signed, though you have to go through a relatively narrow archway to get to the lift, and the people queueing up for the ladies loo were slow to move aside and let us through.  The wheelchair loo has an automatic door operated with large, easy to use touchplates on the outside and on the inside. There are grab rails on both sides of the loo, and room for side transfer. There is an approachable sink, and the usual excellent Dutch round the room at skirting board level alarm cord. "
1278,"Ground outside coffee shop is deep gravel , but there is paving beside the disabled  drop off point to allow access to both levels of the cafe. The toilets are located on the Lower  level of the cafe , so would advise wheelchair users to book ahead, to ensure a table on the lower level. The paving extends from the main gates to the property, the gravel would be difficult for anybody with mobility problems to negotiate.
Seating outside for a rest.
Signage inside poor,  I had to get a friend to look for the accessible loo.
 Cafe  split on 2 levels , with stairs between the levels, no lift or ramp.
Tables were quite close together, friends had to move furniture to allow me to move "
1279,"Adorable, helpful, friendly, alert. Perfect."
1280,"This venue is totally wheelchair freindly, their is no were un-accessible for people with a disability"
1281,Not a great score but that to do with the area being pedestrianised for the festival so limited vehicle and bus access. 
1282,Taxi can drop off right outside on Bread Street. Bus stops on Lothian Road.
1283,"Generally helpful though, being early December they were mostly busy with Christmas customers and the queue for Father Christmas."
1284,"There is just one sign posted disabled toilet on the  ground floor next to the gentleman's toilet. It is very busy with queues all day which can make access to the toilet itself very difficult. However, I asked a member of staff and they kindly took me through the Sir Hugh Casson cafe to the Keepers House which has a separate small lift which gave me access to a second disabled toilet on the lower ground floor with no queue. I have been to the RA of Art on at least 6 occasions and you just have to be prepared to queue or take my advice and visit the toilet in the Keepers House just 2 mins away"
1285,"Level access, plenty of space in the area for one or two wheelchairs."
1286,"The Guinness storehouse is undoubtedly a great day out for tourists and Irish natives alike. The storehouse itself is easily accessible with lifts, ramps and plenty of room to move around. The tour itself is very interesting, taking you through the history of the drink itself and the process of how it's made. The highlight of the tour definitely has to be the gravity bar where you can pour your own pint of Guinness and enjoy it while looking out over all of Dublin. There is even a tap which has been specially adapted for wheelchair users. Mobility wheelchairs are available for use from the information desk free of charge. "
1287,"In a side street across from Kelvingrove Galleries is a small shop that contains the best of what you will ever have! Friendly staff take your order and pair it with your favourite coffee, delivering to a cute seating area. Please visit, doughnuts and coffee in this beautiful café with friends leads to deliciousness."
1288,"There is a car park for visitors with a member of staff at the gate. There is a charge, and the ranger gives you a handy map and leaflet about the area and places to explore. The carpark is very level if a little gravelly. The accessible parking spaces are right by the entrance to the trail."
1289,This is a superb stopping point for a disabled user - everything is super accessible
1290,All staff very helpful.
1291,Easy level access throughout house. What I loved was you could sit down in most of the rooms so after an hour we didn't feel tired. The gardens are set out to enjoy wether you can walk a little or can tackle a longer walk down to the lime walk and around the lake. 
1292,"There are stated to be 147 accessible toilets within the stadium, accessed via RADAR key. The two toilets that we visited during our trip were both spacious, with fixed rail on the wall side and drop-down rail on the other side."
1293,All staff were lovely and very helpful. Though perhaps a little extra training for ticket sales staff into the wide variances in access needs would help them to help guests better. 
1294,We only briefly interacted with staff but they were all friendly. 
1295,"Getting into the Resource Centre was through an automated door where you press a button to gain access. Once inside there's a lowered reception counter which was good. No resting your chin on the counter here! 

The corridors were wide and clearly defined and easy to negotiate using my powerchair. All areas I visited were accessible and where there were doors these were easy to manage."
1296,Great lot's of spaces and a flat curb 
1297,"I'm only allowed to award five stars maximum but I'd have liked to have given two sets of five stars for our visit and the folk we met. The ladies on the desk at the visitor centre were fabulous - not phased by my usual question of how accessible the experience is for wheelchair users. They talked through the visitor journey, where the loos were, what we could see, and how the tickets worked. Finishing by giving us a handy map to plot our way!

When we arrived at the house two cheery stewards met us. Explained how the tour route was accessible all the way through, the options for the audio guides and when I said I didn't 'get on' with audio guides offered a beautifully printed and easy to follow transcript for me to use. They were friendly, amusing and made such a big difference to our visit. Well done to team Abbotsford; particularly as all of these folk were volunteers!"
1298,Busses stop all along Shaftesbury Av. Taxis can pull up nearby.
1299,"The film house is a staple for any film lover in Edinburgh or visitor. One sunny April afternoon we went to see a Paul Verhoeven double bill, unfortunately we booked ages before when we weren't use to seeing the sun! Throughly enjoyed Robocop (a lot more funnier than I remembered) and  Starship Troppers."
1300,disabled parking close to building entrance
1301,"It's on the royal mile therefore there is no direct parking , however there are some disabled parking spots on the street behind the venue"
1302,"I found the toilet spacious enough for my wheelchair, the drop down rail and pepermant one made transfer easy, as was the raised seat.

As one would hope in a disabled toilet, whether it be in the UK or Fuerteventura. "
1303,"Ample disabled parking in large car park at Ravenglass station.
Access to trains so easy, staff very accommodating.
A great steam train ride in special wheelchair accessible carriages."
1304,"Staff were friendly, welcoming and service was very efficient. "
1305,The lady who served us was fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble. She checked occasionally that everything was okay and totally ignored my dog. She could train staff elsewhere on how to behave around assistance dogs!
1306,"I walked here, but there is on-street parking nearby and bus stops on surrounding streets. "
1307,"A thoughtfully designed interior suitable for a powerchair user with personal needs. The 'cottage' was ramped to gain access but level throughout, also decorated nicely. The garden was accessible with a bench table and seating, a pond and fountain to add interest and sound. While sitting outside we were visited by a lovely cat and family of chickens. We had friends join us and found the kettle couldn't be filled at the same time as the shower was running, which was quirky but not an issue. 

Our hosts were delightful, chatted over tea in the garden and helped with things I had forgotten or hadn't thought of.  I am planning a return visit."
1308,There's a car park with blue badge spaces outside the hostel and landscape discovery centre (which share the same eco-friendly building). We also saw modern local buses stopping there several times a day. 
1309,"Easy access on mobility scooter, plenty of space, lift to all floors, friendly, helpful staff."
1310,All very friendly who we met.
1311,The accessible loo was a surprise as it was quite spacious and had a good wide door for access. There are grab rails and it was spotlessly clean and tidy. Didn't see any emergency alarm cord.
1312,"Helpful, answered questions, managed queues well."
1313,The reporter lives right next to the accessible platform.
1314,"Entry to the aquarium is 12.90 Euros with wheelchair users charged at the 60+ years at 10.90 Euros.  Seemingly there is an extra charge to see a film.  Perhaps we ought to have done that to eek out our visit.   As per the norm with such places, the exit ended up in a large gift shop, from which we found it hard to find the actual exit.    Once exited from the gift shop, one ends up beside a very large Cafeteria/Restaurant. Due to the size of it and choice off food, I imagine that this is  used for other functions.
Overall we enjoyed our visit to this attraction that we found to be well laid out and clean.  Staff were doing information talks but we seemed to always get there when the were ending.  An interesting attraction which will appeal to all ages."
1315,Service was good
1316,Some areas are down steps and you need to go in the back entrance by the hotel as there are steps at the front.
1317,Parking is available on the street in front. Blue Badges are free but if you don't have a badge you pay at the machines before going into the Cafe or around the town. Can be hard to find a space at times.
1318,I found the greeting very helpful as it would help visually impaired people know what assistance they need. 
1319,"Don't know about disabled parking (apparently you can reserve Blue Badge spots in Great College Street), but we walked down Whitehall from Charing Cross Station, and was pleasantly surprised by how relatively wheelchair friendly Whitehall is - lots of smooth dropped curbs and wide pavements. There are some nastier curbs getting round the south side of Trafalgar Square and over the top of Westminster Bridge was crowded, but overall pretty good. Westminster Underground is step free and right along from the visitors entrance."
1320,"Accessible toilet a good size for wheelchair and carer, entrance to toilet with radar key, staff on hand if you don't have one. Toilet very clean."
1321,"Good accessible bathroom, but a steep ramp to get up to it"
1322,There was disabled parking but not much of it.
1323,"Once inside, the accessible toilet is directly to the right of the level entrance and is at the end of the bar. The staff keep a key for the toilet behind the bar, but as the toilet is next to them they should see you straight away. The toilet itself is spacious and clean."
1324,Looking from the outside you can't help but wonder if the access is going to be OK. A modern building created in a layered fashion draws you in to explore.
1325,"There is step-free, level access through wide automatic doors leading from the car park to the shop. Inside, the shop is quite packed full, but the corridors are wide enough for a wheelchair user to browse comfortably. Items aren't stacked too high on most shelves which is good. There are lots of pets to look at, including the very popular rabbits in the centre of the shop. There is also an induction loop inside. The counters at the checkout are quite high however."
1326,Two easy open doors 
1327,Most of the restaurant was level access with moveable furniture.  Two areas were raised with three steps.
1328,"Staff at the Elephant Coffee prioritise their customer’s needs. There are narrow spaces between tables which may be an issue for wheelchair users. Staff are however on hand to assist if required to accommodate to customers needs. Nearby there is accessible parking available with a level path to the café. There is only one toilet, which is adaptable for different customers needs."
1329,"The entrance to the building was more than accessible for all, the ramp towards the side of the building made access with a wheelchair possible. Although busy, there was plenty of space in the café so it didn’t come across over crowded. Morrisons was clean and tidy, the toilets were well maintained as well as the café. "
1330,"*Shudder*. First of all, the good news: it's easy to get a parking place on the day in the allocated field for blue badge holders across the road from the venue, and they had laid down a plastic walkway this year to help you get from your car up to the road without having to cross too much grass or other uneven surfaces. The problem is getting there: the trains and tube in London are 90% useless for wheelchair-users, so we have to endure a long, hot, slow drive through cramped residential roads to get to the Wimbledon tennis from where we live in the north of the city. It's a good job it's a fun day out when you get there, because this has almost put us off going again."
1331,Lots of parking at Kirkgate Park Close to play park and less than 10 minutes to the cafe. All flat with good views if the Loch. It would be a short walk from Kinross town centre which is served by busses. 
1332,"The staff were brilliant but the accessibility isn't fantastic because of the platform lift to take you from street level up to the restaurant (see pic). It may be ok for a manual chair user but a tight squeeze for powerchair users and a bit fiddly so really needs someone to assist you.  Once you're up in the restaurant, things are good - some of the restaurant has moveable chairs and tables, the rest have long tables and some benches/stools can be moved.  Might be tricker to get about when its busy (it was quiet when we were there)."
1333,Staff were so lovely and helpful. As I mentioned above I was admitted into the auditorium earlier so I could take my seat. 
1334,This music venue is used for a variety of events. It has superb acoustics and is a great place for hearing all sorts of performances.
1335,"A fantastic trip, to welcome the reopened theatres, "
1336,Staff were friendly and helpful. Service was very good.
1337,"Free parking and it was very easy to find,"
1338,"The RADAR toilet is always very clean, there is a pull alarm and bars around the toilet that can be moved up.
This toilet is also used as a changing area and staff toilet however."
1339,There are a few branches of Mimi's Bakehouse. I visited the one in the City Art Centre. Cakes were amazing and access was step free.
1340,It is very accessible. The lifts are very spacious and there is enough room to go forwards out of the lift. I have never actually stayed in the hotel - primarily using it for meetings and having lunch at the Crossbar Restaurant - however I am aware that there are 13 accessible rooms out of the total of 228. None of these 13 have a hoist but there is one available in the health club to allow entry to the pool.
1341,Staff were polite.
1342,15 blue badge parking spaces but mainly taken by parents taking their kids to swimming and the management don't do anything about it.
1343,They were very nice and very helpful
1344,The centre is fully accessible to wheelchair users except for a small corner of the Butterfly House which can be viewed from an alternate platform.
1345,"A slabbed entrance walkway takes you from the car park into the visitor centre. Here you have the choice of visiting the well stocked gift shop, popping in the cafe for a coffee and cake or proceeding straight to the exhibition on onward to the battlefield.

The visitor centre is spacious and there’s plenty of room to move around; although it can sometimes get very busy. The cafe was of the self service style and you pay at a pay point. We found the staff here were amazingly helpful and we were soon settled at a table pondering how many marshmallows they could cram in to a hot chocolate and then cover with cream!
The entrance to the exhibition start with the information desk where you buy your tickets and you can get an audio guide to help you explore. The tour stars with quite dim corridors of artefacts and then you can dip in to a film area, and move on to the more open space where a canon and other munitions serve to remind of the devastation of battle. 

Leaving the visitor centre via the automated doors we went out on the the wind swept battlefield. Flags fluttered in the distance indicating the battle lines of each of the opposing forces. We walked for a bit until we came to the stones marking the graves of the many clans who took part and the memorial in the centre of the field. It was an eerily moving experience and touched us more than we thought as we saw many of the clan markers had flowers left by folk with an affinity to the names.

The whole perimeter can be walked around but we’d advice dressing for the weather as it was a wee bit cold when we ventured out.
"
1346,This is located near the rear of the venue and is well sign posted with in the venue staff were also pointing people in the direction of the toilets. The accessible toilet is next to the ladies and gents toilets and is the first one you come to. The door opens outwards and has grip rails on both sides there is room for a care giver if required. The toilet was  clean and bright however you need to be careful as you open the door people stand in this area waiting for friends and family to come out of the toilet and you can hit someone with the door if they are standing outside it. People think doors open inwards  
1347,Access to the cafe is excellent.  The main door is wide enough for a powerchair and there is easy access to both the seating and the counter without having to manoeuvre past people or furniture.  There is a slight ramp to get into the cafe but this has been designed to be very shallow and should not cause any issues.  There is also seating outside where there is a bowl of water and a dong benching ring should this be required.
1348,I arrived in Dundee by public transport (train) and made my way around the city using a manual wheelchair with power assisted by a Batec. It was simple enough to get to the McManus from the train station. I did notice a couple of accessible parking bays in the forecourt of the McManus.
1349,It was easy to find and very big and spacious
1350,"Good level access, parking, accessible toilets, and plenty of space."
1351,Good access from the rear of the gallery. Level access from the car park to the automatic entry doors in to the building.
1352,None directly attached to the venue. Accessible loo available in George Square gardens during festival.
1353,"Parking is always difficult to find in Cromer, but there are a few disabled spaces near the church which we use regularly. The large car park near the centre always has spaces as well."
1354,"Those of us with memories of how The Astoria was before the refurbishment all agree it is now so much better. Warm. Comfy seats. But it could be so much better.

In the screens I've been to - 3 and 5 - the sound is much better. But the sound proofing is in adequate. Recently whilst watching Mary Poppins Returns there was a constant rumble from an adjoining screen showing some block buster.

Then let's talk about accessibility. Screens 3, 4 and 5 are accessible. They are not on ground level. But there is a wheelchair lift to take you down the equivalent of 10 steps. So far so good. But be warned, it is quite a walk to a disabled toilet on this lower level.

I first visited in November and refurbishment was still on going in the two upstairs screens. I assumed that to comply with accessibility requirements Reel would put in a lift to upstairs. Wrong! The two upstairs screens can only be accessed via the stairs. No good for me. (Ambulant disabled) Let alone someone in a wheelchair 

I queried this when I visited. The young guy on duty was clearly embarrassed. ""I'm sorry sir. All I can suggest is you contact us beforehand and we'll let you know if the screen is accessible.""

Such a pity. 

It's great that Reel cinemas have spent money on the Astoria. But its not a ""proper job"""
1355,There are plenty of labelled parking signs all around the main quarry site with disabled parking available.
1356,lots of disabled parking outside doors
1357,"Large wet room with toilet and grab rails, plenty of space to turn and access and very clean."
1358,This accessible VR gaming experience is great for the whole family and is located just outside the city centre of Dundee.
1359,"The front entrance had a small step up with hand rail, entrance through the back was ideal for wheelchairs or walking frame."
1360,"Friendly and helpful. A member of staff offered help to remove a chair from the table for a family member using a wheelchair. Although you place orders at the bar, staff are attentive to needs and make sure you're happy with your meal."
1361,"The loo was very high. It had a drop-down rail to one side and a fixed rail on the other. Grab rails in the wet-room shower area and a freestanding but good and solid shower seat. Shower was rather high, even on it's lowest setting."
1362,"Wheelchair entry into the pub is reasonable, although the door is rather heavy. There are two seating areas accessible to people with mobility impairments - one in group of tables in front of the bar, and one via a ramp. However, all the tables in these areas have legs placed such that I could not position myself under the table, ie either a single central leg, or the legs just being too close together. While the food was good, the table design led to me spilling food up myself."
1363,"This only gets three stars because it is so crowded that it is difficult to enjoy, particular if you have mobility problems. However, the whole store is accessible and the staff are generous with their time and their assistance in finding lifts, toilets, cafés etc. It's a fun place to visit, but the whole world thinks so too and the sheer numbers of people just visiting for the experience of it can be a problem. We found the ice-cream parlour (first floor) to be too frantic but the chocolate café (second floor) is calmer and unique. Bring your credit card!"
1364,Received a nice welcome from the staff when I wheeled in. No mention of the lack of access though.
1365,"Unable to use disabled toilet because I am a hoist transfer. However, had a look and it was very spacious. "
1366,"Couldn't have been more helpful, especially with helping us to rearrange furniture to create a space that suited our requirements. "
1367,"Automatically opening doors lead to 3 lifts to access the 1st floor reception area and restaurant. As with many accommodation providers the idea that a disabled person may have a carer and a child seems to confuse them. After a brief wait we were lead to a large r with a hastily added 3rd bed, but there was still plenty of space and a huge wet room. "
1368,As a manual wheelchair user it had everything required.
1369,RADAR key entry. The sign says for customers only but if you need and explain why then they are fine with letting you in. The red cord was hanging to the floor and there is enough room for a powerchair and companion too. There are handrails around the toilet. To get to the toilet you have to go close to the till and turn left as there is seating blocking the space that a wheelchair user would need to get by.
1370,Free disabled parking.
1371,Is very tight for space if you use a wheelchair but I have seen people using them in there and seem very content. The staff will find you a low table if one is available so might be advisable to contact them first.
1372,Very helpful!
1373,When I visited the staff were very friendly and helpful.
1374,Level access and staff are happy to move things around.
1375,Helpful and willing to take us to our space.
1376,There is parking within the Omni Centre. There is also a hand bus stop not too far from the side entrance. You're also within easy reach of the York Place team stop some 500m away.
1377,"No close proximity parking - good bus services out side the door. Also, soon to be opened tram stop."
1378,Buchanan Street is a pedestrian area. There are nearby bus links and stations.
1379,"Private, secure car park, with plenty of rooms for cars.."
1380,"There are a number of disabled blue badge parks directly outside the main entrance, but most are ordinary width, so difficult to get in and out of car.  However, the car park is massive, and we were always able to park close to the entrance straddling two normal bays, so able to get easily into the wheelchair from the car."
1381,Pub is on one level.
1382,All staff appeared helpful and friendly during my visit.
1383,"The gardens are in a bus route (East Gate) and there is on street parking (West Gate), but the council have bollarded off what was the disabled parking so I'm not sure how good that is now"
1384,I've never had a problem.
1385,Just need to discuss access needs when booking.
1386,The only staff we spoke to were in the café. They seemed pleasant enough.
1387,All staff were polite and helpful. The castle staff were particularly good. They were very keen to ensure that I was having a good day out.
1388,"7 Accessible parking bays, and one drop-off point within 60 metres, bus stops approximately 120 metres.   Railway station approximately 1 mile."
1389,"This country house hotel is located near Basingstoke in Hampshire. We had a afternoon tea & were very pleased with the whole experience. Wheelchair access to the main part of the hotel is via a ramp to the right of the main door. You ring a door bell & someone comes to let you in. All the staff were wonderful & couldn't have been more helpful. We found access around the ground floor easy & there was a huge, clean disabled loo near reception. We had booked in advance, so were given a lovely table near the window with one chair removed so the wheelchair could go straight up to the table which was the perfect height. There was a choice of luxury teas & the sandwiches & cakes were very good. The chef was easily able to provide for different diets."
1390,"Host have tried hard to make this a pleasant place to stay.  Not as quiet or private as we would have liked. 
The walks on the doorstep were lovely via country lanes which were very quiet.  Envied able-bodied as they could access beautiful looking country walks from the site itself. 
Plenty of farm animals adjacent and birds kept on site to entertain us. 
Beds very comfortable and wet room excellent. The lighting in the sitting room is inadequate and they have tried to rectify this but we still found it hard to read in the evening. The kitchen layout is very strange and limited, which did make me feel seriously frustrated. "
1391,"No stairs to tackle, lifts"
1392,Individual places to eat and drink within the Tower have accessible toilets.
1393,"The sea wall walk between Dawlish and Dawlish Warren is a padestrianised path just above the beach. There are wonderful, amazing views as on one side  you have the sea and the other the busy Great Western railway line with trains reguarly passing by. Before commencing the walk I had read on several websites that this part of the sea wall walk was described as being an easy, level walk. I found this misleading as the route was not as easy as I had been lead to believe due to the surfacing and a couple of quite notable slopes. In my review I'm going to describe the walk in the direction from Dawlish to Dawlish Warren and I've included a lot of photos, which I hope you will find helpful in deciding whether or not the walk meets your access needs. 
Walking the sea wall walk in the opposite direction, from Dawlish to Coryton Cove, is step free, plus there is an accessible toilet and I've done a seperate review for this.
Please be aware this route is not suitable for anyone when the weather is extreme.
"
1394,"A holiday lodge in a beautiful setting with disabled access that has really been thought through, and it hasn't lost charm for convenience. 

Carrbridge is also a great town for disable access, with an accessible treetop walk at the Landmark Park, and and the local horse and carriage rides due to launch a wheelchair friendly carriage at the end of 2017."
1395,"The entrance into the pub is negotiable in a wheelchair, but the large metal ridge of the door is quite tricky to get over. Once you're inside, the ground floor, although crowded with comfy furniture, is reasonably easy to navigate. "
1396,"Level entry from the street. Restaurant is not overly spacious, so make a reservation and inform them that you are in a chair - they are quite helpful with moving tables and chairs around, but the space is tight. "
1397,"The staff were excellent. Before I visited I had to contact the hotel twice. Once to check about my room and they were happy for me to change it to one with a shower. Secondly I had difficultly getting a response from the taxi firms on the La Rochelle Airport website and when I contacted the hotel they promptly replied with a taxi firm who I was able to book. When I arrived the lady at reception offered to take my case to my room and checked I would be ok using the lift. Breakfast was a self service buffet although I was fine there was no member of staff in the breakfast room to seat guests when they arrived, however judging from the helpfulness at reception I think if I had said I said I needed help at breakfast they would arrange it."
1398,"The food is lovely and the drinks are reasonably priced, their roast dinner hits the top 10 best list in Essex. 
Dogs are welcome in there and friendly and the locals like to talk with you. They have comedy in there and drag nights, but these are downstairs and they only have one entrance. "
1399,Easy to get into. There is only one. It is quite large and well equipped though.
1400,It's central and on Lothian Road so accessible via bus and a  short roll from the tram stop either Shandwick or Princes Street. There is now a drop curb just in front of it with perhaps a couple of centimeters in height which makes accessibility much better than it used to be. 
1401,Each room had an ensuit and with showers or baths. One of the baths had a lift in it so anyone could get in and out easily 
1402,"we always take a work vehicle that is a transit van for 3 or 4 residents in wheelchairs, and there is parking out the back right next to the easily accessible entrance, the theatre has its own car park which needs to be paid for in the day and evening otherwise it is a 15 min walk from the train and bus station"
1403,"West Princess Street is flat and paved. You turn into a short alleyway to get to Riverhill. This is cobbled, and although a bit more bumpy, I think would be manageable for most.

The doorway has a flat entrance, the door is not automatic and does not have a push button. 

The small entrance area could be quite tight if using a power-chair or scooter. It's fairly narrow, and when busy, people tend to stand around here waiting to get to the toilets.

There is a set of two doors to get into the restaurant 
These are narrow so would require both to be opened to get through in a wheelchair. 

The ground floor of the restaurant /bar is level with the entrance and flat throughout. There is a mixture of  tables and seating, seats can be moved to suit your needs.

There is a mezzanine level reached by a staircase only. 

Staff will come to tables to take orders"
1404,Flat access to buildings and wide dors
1405,"Parking can be problematic but if you're lucky you can temporarily park at the front of the restaurant. This is ideal for offloading a wheelchair safely. As we walked to the restaurant, we avoided the difficulty of finding parking and proved easier for us."
1406,"William was really helpful and an excellent tour guide, even though it wasn't part of his job."
1407,Staff were friendly and helpful 
1408,Parking isn't the best but then the approach to the Castle is a bit of challenge for everyone. There is a hand accessible parking bay on Johnston Terrace just by the Hub. You could take the option of using the accessible tour buses that stop at the Lawnmarket around 100 metres from the Whisky Experience or maybe take an accessible taxi to the door.
1409,Pleasant enough.
1410,"Brooks is a ten-minute walk from Haymarket Railway Station, the bus interchange and the tram stop. Lothian Buses’ 35 service passes within 50m of the front door and serves the airport, the Royal Mile, Parliament, Easter Road, and The Royal Yacht Britannia.

If arriving by car or taxi you can be dropped off right outside the door. There are a limited number of private parking spaces in a nearby car park that can be booked in advance by arrangement.  The pavements in the area are fairly good for wheelchair users and have dropped kerbs with plenty of crossings. It's a short distance from the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, Lothian Road, and into the heart of the city."
1411,Staff were friendly.
1412,We used the nearby Chapelfield car park which has very good access.
1413,A good place to eat and drink apart from a broken automatic door and quite a lot wrong with the accessible toilet.
1414,"Right outside Vauxhall train station, underground and bus station."
1415,The staff were really great and I'm sure they could tell you where a book is or help you get one that is out of reach. I also loved meeting their dog who just wanted to play! Overall it was a really nice atmosphere and they do have a great selection of books.
1416,Small permanent ramp in main doorway into pub ......no automatic door opening
1417,"As with all of the National Trust Scotland staff I have encountered so far, they have been extremely helpful and friendly."
1418,This venue is 20 mins walk from the Railway Station and mostly on the level. The Life Centre is fully wheelchair accessible throughout.
1419,"The main entrance was a revolving door which we used as was fun, there was a conventional door to the side.
Lifts to all floors.
Safe spaces at the stairwells in case of emergencies, didn't check it out so don't know if there were Evac chairs assuming there would be."
1420,"No step access at front and rear door.  Front door may be too narrow for larger wheelchairs or powerchairs, but rear is a double door with a ramp.  

Probably best to let them know if you are booking and taking a wheelchair - the back of the restaurant is probably a bit crowded to be comfortable getting in and out."
1421,"All were very pleasant and helpful, finding time for quick chat, even though they were busy, it’s all part and parcel of this delightful store."
1422,"A wheelchair accessible zoo with a wide range of rescued animals, handling sessions, play park and cafe. I visit every year with my nephew around the time of his birthday as it has become a family tradition for his birthday. It's a great zoo and we all enjoy our visits. "
1423,Spacious enough for turning space for wheelchair and carer.  Disabled toilet identified.  No hoist changing space in any toilet - they are not large enough.  In reception area
1424,"I give them three stars as there were a couple of different points with toilets, including accessible toilets. But - I didn't use them or look in so not sure how well fitted they were."
1425,our residents have always been made very welcome and we even have regular people who know some of our residents by name
1426,"Did not see disabled bay, but enough room, best to pull round the corner to be near hotel entrance"
1427,"The accessible toilets on both floors were spacious, well equipped and spotlessly clean."
1428,Really helpful. Happy to carry  beverages to the table and adjust the furniture.
1429,"The gallery, having been closed for some time, has been reopened to not only reveal the original Victorian ceiling, but to wide corridors, lift access and good toilet facilities. 
The new ceramics collection on the first floor is well worth the visit. Though disappointed the gallery is not free of charge any longer, there are different fee options depending on income and whether in receipt of benefits."
1430,The staff at the restaurant were awful but the member of staff at the bowling alley was nice.
1431,Access is excellent in the Assembly rooms but festival staff don't seem to be trained and some of the vantage points for wheelchair users in the venues are really poor.
1432,"I attended the Tom Jones concert in Princess Street Gardens with my friend who is on crutches as she has a back condition and is registered as disabled. We were told that we had to enter by King's Stable Road-which was easy enough then told that the raised viewing point for people with disabilities was passed the new fountain then follow the people who were telling us were to go, we then had to walk up a big hill which took us level with Princess Street, once we managed to get my friend to walk up the hill we found the seating area (two rows on a barriered platform) we gave our names and sat down, on the tickets it said that their was waiter service, as no staff were around other than the ones taking the names,we had to then walk back down another hill so that my friend could see what food and drinks was available!! During the concert the people who has been taking the names and putting the wrist bands on at the entrance then came up onto the platform and were dancing and basically blocking everyone's view which was very annoying as once one person stood up to watch most people done the same-not much cope when you are in a wheelchair or have limited mobility.  When the concert finish we got up to go and were told that we couldn't leave this area for at least 15 mins so that everyone else (well over a thousand people) could leave, I explained that my friends daughter would be waiting on us and was sternly told we were not getting passed the barrier!! When we were eventually herded out like cattle we could not get back down the hill to Kings Stable as there was still people trying to get out so we had to exit via The Mound. Total shambles both on the disabled access and the organising and customer service of the staff and stewards."
1433,Very friendly and helpful
1434,Very easy to find the toilet and in a great location. The wheelchair is able to fit through on observation and appears to be easy to navigate around. The toilet contains a red alarm pull cord for emergency purposes.
1435,"Great visit to the best fish and chip cafe in Scotland! Great disabled parking right outside, gravel at outdoor table area difficult to access, but Owner addressing that. Staff super friendly and very disabled aware. 
The owner Sarah has a passion for access and inclusion that was palpable and alive, this blew my mind and made this lunch special"
1436,Their accessible loo needs a radar key. Generally in okay repair. Has grab rails and is Generally tidy. It's also a baby changing unit which does take up a fair amount of space when it's down.
1437,"We stayed for 2 nights B&B, but were so impressed that we also had dinner here on both nights. "
1438,"Had a look for the accessible loo that CalMac promised on Euan's Guide but couldn't see anything. Ended up eventually going to a public accessible loo in the aquarium/harbour management building 10 mins walk away at the far end of the seafront (luckily I was using a scooter so I could get there), and that was excellent. Well done aquarium. "
1439,The staff were really helpful. Not being sure if I would fit through the narrow spaces a staff member took me to the narrowest point and to see the style of lift so I could decide if the visit would work for me as a powerchair user. All of this before buying my ticket. Other staff helped with the lift doors when I need a hand. The cafe staff were happy to take things to a table. The gift shop staff were happy to help as required. The efforts of the staff made the experience one to remember and I will recommend friends to visit the Cutty Sark if they're in the area.
1440,"We phoned ahead of visit and were assured that there would be no problems with a camper van and 2 disabled visitors.  We could not find a parking space out of the way for our van & so parked in a disabled bay.  The bays are very tight, just large enough for a car.  A woman came out and told us that she was not happy with where we had parked but could not offer us an alternative and said that camper vans usually paid a 'bit more' the parking display did not show 'a bit more' fee.  After more discussion we left the woman still unhappy with us.  The café had a very steep ramp and was difficult to negotiate.  We had to ask another visitor where to pay, the shop was pointed out to us.  My husband had to call into the shop for assistance but no one was available to put the ramp out!  We were then informed that we had not required the 2 hours left to go on the audio tour.  We left at this stage very disappointed."
1441," There is a disabled toilet off the bar and to the hotel's credit, they are going to make the doorway wider for powerchairs as it's a bit tight.  Inside, the toilet is clean and spacious and it has grab rails. "
1442,Formerly called Centotre is now called Contini Ristorante at 103 George Street serving up mighty fine Itallian grub. Pasta a particular highlight.
1443,"Not only is this store fully accessible, the staff are really helpful and friendly, without being obtrusive. "
1444,"Great loo, clean, spacious, handrails etc. BUT someone thought they'd store the baby high chairs in there - so could barely get my wheel in let alone manoeuvre it, had to lunge across the room for the grab rail and couldn't get to the hand drier at all. Bad form!"
1445,No accessible toilets.
1446,The staff we met and particular those in the cafe were welcoming and helpful.
1447,A wheelchair accessible restaurant with a range of food choices including vegan. Located at the entrance to Almondvale Shopping Centre.
1448,"The accessible loo - for me was one of the highlight .... I've never in many years of visiting pop up venues as a powerchair user seen a loo with such a good ramp access and an automated door. No more acrobatics to try and balance on a ramp and open a door ! Once inside there was space to 'have a party' .... Beautifully clean, spacious and well appointed. "
1449,Good firm path with a few ups and downs. Good car park with excellent facilities
1450,Had read about this loo when searching for accessible travel & tourism info when visiting Bute. Delighted to find it open and clean & tidy even in winter!  
1451,there was a lot of stairs but not that many lifts. There was some induction loops. 
1452,"There are no steps into the main building and there are two disabled toilets - one inside - and one outside. Part of the picnic area is not accessible at the moment but work is in progress right now (10th August 2015) which will redress this problem soon. (Author's recommendation).

There is a stretch of gravel pathway before meeting the boardwalk which can be bypassed by allowing disabled drivers to drive close to the boardwalk by speaking to someone in the information centre or by mobile telephone from the car. The boardwalk from then on circles all permitted areas of the reserve."
1453,"Brown's is a luxury hotel in Mayfair. It is known for its discreet, understated elegance. Afternoon tea is served in the wooden panelled Drawing Room. There is a single step into the hotel, and if required a ramp can be provided. The Drawing Room and accessible toilet are on the ground floor and have step free access. If you're looking for a traditional English afternoon tea experience, with excellent quality food and impactable service, Brown's is the perfect choice. This is a review for afternoon tea in the Drawing Room of Brown's Hotel. I did not stay in the hotel so unable to comment on its accommodation."
1454,"Automatic doors all over the place, spacious (huge!) Lift, accessible loos & shower! 
This is an amazingly successful renovation and has a lovely atmosphere as well as art exhibitions, shop, courses and cafe. "
1455,All of the staff were really lovely and helpful although not intrusive unnecessarily.
1456,"Parking space for the cottage is right outside the door, the car park is level tarmac and is shared with other guests.  The road to the cottage is used by farm traffic but there are passing places available."
1457,"The DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel is located in Bread Street and is a short distance, around ten-minutes walk, from Lothian Road, the Edinburgh International Conference Centre and the Grassmarket."
1458,"As a supermarket, there was of course lots of parking and disabled bays. There were no steps to get to the loos."
1459,Free parking for blue badge holders on the Esplanade.  Wouldn't have thought public transport would go near the castle.
1460,Fabulous donkeys
1461,"As you arrive towards the house you natuarally follow signs straight ahead for reception, which takes you into a reasonably big car park, but there are no disabled bays here.
If we had known, we would have turned left at a junction in the grounds itself, marked for Spa, and that would have given us a far easier entry into the hotel.
For the reason we did not know about this entrance, we have dropped marks to 3.5 overall. This left turn for the Spa is reviewed in PART TWO of ALBRIGHTON HALL."
1462,We were shown around the Establishment by the manager Matt who gave us some information about the hotel. He was very friendly and welcoming and answered many questions regarding the hotel and surrounding areas. The catering staff all had smiles on their faces which is always pleasant.  The hotel provide staff to assist in any situation whether that be during meal times or during the day. They even provide overnight support if needed. The 1:1 support and other royalties provided by the hotel come at an extra cost.
1463,"Queuing staff are great, but for some reason at this venue I've found bar staff to be less friendly than everywhere else at the Fringe, both times I've been. It's odd.  "
1464,"Young friendly, helpful and professional."
1465,"Not signposted but obvious where it is
Large area that I think would fit a mobility scooter
Toilet raised I'd say 
Plenty rails."
1466,"Level entry front door, excellent for my scooter. I could use my scooter outside on the paving slabs and enjoy the view. Cottage on one level, living room with kitchen and dining, bedroom and adapted bathroom."
1467,Allocated bays at front entrance
1468,As Barnitts is in the city centre there is limited parking. However there are several car parks close to the centre which are easily accessible. 
1469,"There is a very small step (couple of inches or so) up into the cafe, but should not be a problem for a wheelchair user. Once inside there is ample space & is all on one level."
1470,We parked about 2 minutes away from the ground. I also noticed there were 2 disabled car parking spaces opposite the ground. The nearest bus stop is about 5 minutes away from the ground at James Square.
1471,"No life is needed because it is all level access, I've given it a 4 because there are a few (perhaps 3) bits that were steep enough to make me wonder if my friend would be able to get up, he only needed a push up one bit and put that down to having a new a lighter chair. If you're self-propelling and not feeling very strong, have someone behind you who can push you. There was also a few its that were narrow, we got through if people squeezed out of our way though. There was a few places to rest but not many, it takes roughly 20 minutes to walk through if you don't stop to read all the information. Carers also get in free."
1472,Sign could be clearer
1473,Both the entrance from the hotel side and the street was easily accessed by a wheelchair.
1474,"There is an underground Q-park parking garage not far from the museum with accessible parking and an elevator.  Taxis can also drop you off fairly close to the museum.  To simplify things, the company Accessible Travel Netherlands can arrange taxis for you.  If going by public transport, be sure to call ahead to ensure all the trams are wheelchair accessible."
1475,Didn't need any particular help but staff all attentive and sure would have been happy to help.
1476,"Accessible bathroom with roll-in shower and emergency pull cords.
Handheld Shower with Hose Built-in Shower Transfer Seats
Handrails Roll-in Showers Safety Bar in Shower
Bathroom Doors Open Outwards (in Accessible Rooms)
Accessible Bathroom Controls"
1477,"Super helpful! Told me about the Palace, and heard them assisting others with directions."
1478,"The car park is huge and plenty of room 2 get in and out of the cars. I didnt, however, notice if they had specific areas 4 disabled parking. We managed fine without it."
1479,"Pleasant , informative and joyous."
1480,"There are no toilets on the site but the adjacent, 100m, new library and museum building had excellent toilets including a Changing Places Toilet."
1481,"An OK restaurant, but had to move other patrons from tables to access loo."
1482,"Pretty easy to find as signs are around and if you can’t see the signs, there are lots of staff walking around that you could ask. "
1483,They are busy (as you would expect in a busy pub) but perfectly willing to help with food & drink.
1484,"Flat access to get inside, somewhat crowded inside but doable to move around in a power chair. Table service for food."
1485,There are two here an external one and one at the cafe. The external one however even if you have a radar key can't be accessed unless you go to find a member of staff to unlock the extra lock at the top of the door! I have told them that this causes a problem because you cannot simply access it without finding staff to help you. They said that they were afraid it would be vandalised without extra security! So I would recommend using the one at the cafe. Other than this Heartlands is a good place to go. Just make sure you have cash as some of the shops don't have chip and pin machines. Nearest cash point is at Tesco Extra in Pool just up the road.
1486,"A wonderful collection of modern buldings, gardens, wacky follies, museums and performance spaces, most of which are wheelchair accessible. There's even a retired submarine, the Argonaute. Unfortunately the interior of the submarine isn't wheelchair accessible. The Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie is EUrope's largest science museum and has an Imax cinema inside a huge geodesic dome."
1487,Getting into the store is via the left hand side doors as there's a push pad to operate the automated doors. Getting around the store was easy with plenty of space for my powerchair. The counters were low enough to pay and to collect my purchases.
1488,"This Premier Inn Hotel is situated about 2miles from Harrogate Town Centre but is easy to reach and free parking for Disabled Customers at the rear of the premises.

Easy access to the reception area is all on the level and my accessible bedroom was located on the ground floor with easy access.  I understand there are extra accessible rooms upstairs which are easily reached by lift, but I would ring and check this out before booking.  Parts of the hotel are showing wear and tear but it is up for re-furbishing so check exactly what is on offer before booking.

There is also level access to an excellent restaurant/bar.

The bedroom was very comfortable and the bathroom accommodated my wheelchair easily. Bed height is normally set for wheelchair transfer but if you need extra height you can ask for the bed raisers to be fitted. 

Reception staff were extremely helpful and pleasant."
1489,"As previously stated, you have to go up non dropped kerbs and in a car park of hundreds of spaces only a few are accessible. Nor are they any wider than standard spaces."
1490,"The toilet is almost as big as my bedroom!  Plenty space to manoeuvre, toilet is a good height and has plenty handrails (red cord is down to the floor).  Shower has a flip down seat and lowered shower head.  Only thing that lets it down is lack of changing table and hoist."
1491,The staff member who dealt directly with us was extremely nice.
1492,Very friendly and helpful.
1493,"I booked Access Travel to help transport the members of Lung Ha Theatre Company (http://lungha.com/) between Edinburgh and Glasgow for the tour of The Silent Treatment. Willie was not only on time, patient at waiting for actors to get out of costume on the return legs of each day and able to work within our time guidelines but was also extremely affordable. Perhaps more importantly, he had an excellent manner with all of the actors, calm and patient and it felt like he actually cared about their well being rather than just wanting to get us from A to B as fast as possible. I would highly recommend this service and plan to use it everytime I have to book further Lung Ha tours in the future."
1494,"This property has only 2 steps onto the veranda but these are not the only access, the ramp provides access to the veranda and main entrance, once inside the accommodation is all on one level.  The lounge area has a range of seating options to suit different needs and the open plan nature provides wide spaces for access with mobility aids/wheelchair. The kitchen has two separate stations, one at usual height and another lower to give wheelchairs users full access for meal preparation. Ensuite bedroom has adjustable beds and walk in wetroom with shower wheelchair. Second double bedroom has space for wheelchair user and family bathroom is close by with grab rails and toilet aids."
1495,"On arrival staff checked your tickets at the door and gave directions of where to go. The bar was busy at the interval but service was good. On the way out, going down in the lift there were staff gate keeping it to prioritise it for people with disabailities."
1496,"This is an out door visit, the kelpies are set in helix park by the canal . They are metal art works of Clydesdale horse heads y artist Andy Scott . And are based n two horses called duke and baron. It is easy to get around to look at the sculputure. Each head is surrounded by a small moat. There are both ramps and steps that take you up to look closely at the heads. With plenty of room to get around. There is also a visitor centre and cafe serving hot food, hot drinks and snacks . As well as an outside  catering van . Staff were helpful and the food in the cafe is very nice. Parking is easy there are spaces for disabled near the toilets and it’s also possible to park the car by the visitor centre for disabled people. But you need to get a barrier opened which isn’t maned during some days in the winter months. 
There is also a large play park at the front of the complex which has plenty of activities for children of all ages. "
1497,"Easily a five out five as the staff were great, the space easy to get around, wheelchair access good."
1498,All staff are friendly and very helpful. Restaurant staff reserved a table for us beside the buffet
1499,Because of its location there is no parking outside the bank the nearest parking is with in the Asda car park then via the access ramp to the pedestrian area. There is also some Blue badge parking available on the Main St however this does fill up very quickly during the day. It is also about 150 meters from the store. 
1500,Very hard to use as it’s a cluttered hallway and dangerous.
1501,My first time at the FlyDSA Arena and it won't be my last as I was very impressed with wheelchair accessibility. We travelled from Scotland to see The 1975 and it was one of the best shows I've ever seen.
1502,"Although an interesting hotel, it is not really wheelchair friendly, with a small step from the front or rear entry into the bar or restaurant, there is no lift, and stairs are narrow and twisting in some parts, no way can a disabled person use them. If you can manage the small steps, it’s worth trying, so as to see the hotels main facilities, but we found details of the bedrooms in general to be old, small and not all that inspiring, so I never made the effort to try steps, my husband could never make it."
1503,"Once inside the hotel itself, the access around this old historical Priory was quite easy enough, a level push for your carer will take you past the grand hall and along a corridor to the restaurant, and although a step down, a ramp was very quickly put down for us, and then taken to our seat.
On leaving the restaurant, and pushed up the ramp, we could move around the rooms quite easily as all on the level. We relaxed in the comfortable (library ?) to enjoy a late night drink, before retiring to our very cold room.




"
1504,"Part of Showcase Cinema chain. This is a multiplex cinema, but as not in centre of town, doesn't tend to be too busy.

Shows all the latest films - see website for details of these."
1505,"The access in and around the Aviva Stadium is excellent, there are a total of 5 accessible entrances, depending on which area of the stadium you are in, all with a number of lifts that can be used to get to your seat. There are a total of 230 wheelchair spaces in the Aviva Stadium with seated spaces beside for companions/carers. The Bar and Food outlets around the stadium all have sections with lowered counters so that people in Wheelchairs can reach. "
1506,Didn't really need assistance. Staff were fine (although I got funny looks for taking these photos!).
1507,Everyone we spoke to was lovely and very happy to help. They showed a lot of passion for the company and the local area and made it a really memorable visit.
1508,Always friendly and helpful.
1509,Entrance to cafe was level access and doors remain open. There was no lowered counter. They did bring my drink to me though. I didn't see any designated wheelchair accessible tables either. Due to the amount of chairs and tables some of the cafe was hard to access in a wheelchair.  
1510,"Some pathways have gravel stones however, there are other ways that are more accessible to get to areas of the park. As I said I took my dog for a walk and the grass was a little uneven but I managed. With parks it's never going to be really smooth for wheelchairs because it's nature, but there is always ways to get somewhere. 

The main thing I like about Camperdown is that there play park includes parts that wheelchairs can get on which means everyone is included in the fun. There is a roundabout which a wheelchair can fit on (see image attached) which means that children (and adults) can play with their friends. I tried it and it was fun, but I'm not used to my wheelchair moving without me being in control so it felt weird. 

There's also a ramped area at another section of the play park with means wheelchairs can get access. There's not much on this area but if someone wanted to use the slide but couldn't walk or be carried very far then their wheelchair can get right up to the steps. 

That's all really that wheelchair user can get on but it's better than nothing. The ground is mainly tarmac around this area so wheelchairs can't get stuck in sand or bark. There is another play area that is mainly sand but at least one area isn't. 

There is also plenty of areas for people to sit and have a rest if needed. "
1511,"Very good, helpful, never had a problem whenever I've been there."
1512,"The recently opened 'Trinity Shopping Centre' in Leeds has been designed with lifts in place for wheelchair users which makes it possible to get to all levels, including the trinity kitchen. There are many escalators meaning the wait for a lift is never too long.  There are also wheelchair ramps and manual doors in place when entering/exiting the centre. The centre has been designed well and from the shops that I have been in with a disabled person, I thought that the attitude of the staff was helpful."
1513,"Great wheelchair accessible central hotel located above Dundee’s Train Station.

I was kindly invited to an event at this fantastic central hotel in Dundee representing Euan’s Guide as one of their Dundee Ambassadors. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to stay over, but I was able to previously view the hotels accessible room, read on to find out my thoughts.
"
1514,With a little more thought they could have installed a smaller version of a Changing Places toilet. My son was entirely unable to use this toilet.
1515,"We walked to Fatamorgana, but it is on a main road and a short distance from a busier road with bus stops and tram stops."
1516,"We got the bus in to Glasgow's Buchanan Bus Station. Once we had arrived at the bus station, it was very accessible locating to John Lewis. We accessed the department store via the back entrance, directly opposite the bus station. There's a set of traffic lights where we were able to cross over safely and the open of two enter/exit doors for wheelchair/ pram access in to the store. 
Once we were inside the shop, there were options to either take the lift up/down floors to different departments or the use of escalators. There is also the option of both genders and disabled toilets, which again are spacious and easily accessible.
We noticed each department's floor space to be quite widespread however spaces got narrower when looking around specific sections. This could be a disadvantage to those who require additional space for equipment aids or during busy periods.
We liked how diverse the department store is in terms of getting a wide variety of items for Christmas/ shopping. 
Again, if we were wanting to venture out to other stores, they are easily accessible as John Lewis also exits out in to Buchanan galleries, where both a lift and escalators are available."
1517,"Both entrances have electric automatic doors. The city centre entrance you enter through the doors and there is a sign saying to wait here for assistance. 

There is staffed ticket counters on the city centre side with pull down trays for wheelchairs. There are also stickers saying there are hearing loops. Ticket machines are all the same height and so are the ATM's.

There is a wheelchair accessible gate. Depending on the platform you may or may not need to use a lift. The Pride Park entrance has a lift then barriers (one is wheelchair accessible), if you need disabled assistance you will need to go to the end of corridor, down the lift and into the main entrance. The waiting rooms are level access. The cafes and shops are also level access. The train information boards at the entrances are visual only and the boards on the individual platforms are also visual, I find them hard to see as I struggle to see screens. Audible information does happen but if you have issues hearing in background noise you'll struggle. All the platforms have a hearing loop but I do not know if it works.

Outside the main entrance is a tactile board for the visually impaired which describes the layout of the station. 

Costa inside the station had a hearing loop sticker on display."
1518,"Soho Theatre offers a busy programme of theatre, cabaret,  stand up comedy  and a bar. There's a 150 seat theatre auditorium, a downstairs with level entry cabaret tables and raised stage and upstairs a 92 seater theatre. There is also a bar on the ground floor.


My review is of my visit to see Rosie Jones perform in the Upstairs space. "
1519,The disabled parking is great and close to the entrance.
1520,As above
1521,"The owners, Chris and Chrissy, live on an adjacent property and are on hand for any problems you may have.  They created a path through the gravel forecourt for us which they said they'd be happy to do again. They have direct experience of a friend who uses a wheelchair so are really committed to doing what they can to make the cottage comfortable. Lovely genuine people."
1522,The location was beautiful. We stayed in Girnock and so looked onto the river. My mother can't walk but transfers by standing and shuffling round. She managed well here although toilet was a little high the grab rails helped. She didn't use the armchair as she was afraid it would move as she got in or out of it. I did say I'd steady it or position it against the wall or settee or fit the elephant feet I'd taken. I had to rotate her bed so she could get into it from the left handside (that's from the lying in it point of view) but as it was on big casters that was easy. I loved the fact I did not have to take lots of bits and pieces I've had to travel with on previous occasions. If there had been four of us (the full capacity for Girnock) we might have found the living space cramped. Even for just the two of us it represented very good value for money.
1523,"Didn't book an accessible room but lifts were available although not the largest. Entrance on first floor, there is a ramp but rather steep."
1524,"Parking was really good with lots of spaces, however, there is no accessible bus service to the venue.  They do have a minibus service for people who can use it."
1525,"There is good and easy disabled parking in the front of the hotel.  We travelled by bus and the bus stops are very near, with a pedestrian crossing conveniently placed to get at the bus stop across the road."
1526,"Couldn't be any more helpful! Service with a smile all the time, moved furniture for wheelchair."
1527,"The accessible toilet is at the back. It would be fine but for several really bad problems. (1) The red emergency cord is much too short, useless to anyone who falls to the floor. (2) Big bins block the wheelchair transfer area. (3) The doorknob for releasing the door to get out of the toilet cubicle is much too high on the door for many wheelchair users - a particularly stupid piece of design. For all three problems, see my attached pictures."
1528,"Cluny 2 access review. 
On Friday I managed to get photo passes for a fantastic band called Bigfoot playing the Cluny 2. I rang ahead to see what access was like and they said to give them a shout when I arrived. I went in a manual wheelchair with my partner pushing, luckily we got parked very close and although the side entrance was closed we did manage to get in through the main doors- however there was a difficult step for Michael to pull me up over and someone had to come and open the doors - only to be told we had to go back out again to get in one of the other entrances. Staff suggested pushing me down a very steep bank to their bottom door but we declined as going down steep hills is hard on the person in control of the chair. Instead we asked about the side door which they did open for us, this has a small bump to go up over - which may be difficult if self propelling, plus again the door needs physically opening and holding. One inside we were shown to a lift where you have to hold down the button until the lift arrives - takes a couple of minutes. The door into the lift is manual but stays open once pulled wide - but there is little room to manoeuvre if you are self propelling and doing it yourself. Once in the lift you have to keep holding the button until you reach the floor desired. On the bottom floor where the Cluny 2 is located, moving around is easy as it’s all flat. Once settled in there the only down side is they only sell a tiny selection of their drinks on that floor - able bodied customers generally pop upstairs to get their drinks but that would be impossible to do alone in a wheelchair carrying a drink. Maybe bar staff could help if enough staff present, luckily my partner popped back upstairs to get real ales for us. 
The disabled toilet is located on a different floor and I didn’t attempt to check it out as I didn’t want to lose my space at the front as I needed to take photos for a review.
The staff were friendly and helpful but had little understanding of why going down a steep bank in a wheelchair is difficult. 
All in all it was a great night though
For using Cluny 1  - his is accessible, but there are steps within that room, so only part of the room is accessible."
1529,"There is only one disabled toilet which is at reception. There are other toilets in the grounds, but only one is at ground level."
1530,"This is a modern centre, with interesting displays about the 4,500 year old standing stones.  Corridors are wide, and it could be very accessible centre.

However, there are a couple of small improvements they could make to make it easier to use:
- step free access to the toilets from outside (there is a very small step today)
- automate the swing door from the toilets to the cafe
- create dedicated disabled parking spaces."
1531,No problem getting a blue badge parking space near the entrance.
1532,There is a ramp at the front door. There was plenty of space to move around in my wheelchair. There is one downstairs accessible room.
1533,The accommodation is all on the ground floor.  There are lowered light switches . Plenty of literature available to enable you to decide where to go in handy laminated sheets which detail wheelchair walks. 
1534,"As a young Sheffield United fan I want to travel to away matches to back my team and Peterborough united seemed like a good idea. I am unfortunately confined to a wheelchair and away grounds can sometimes seem daunting experiences: where is the accessible parking, where are the seats, are they accessible, where are there disabled toilets etc.? Supporting your team is a great feeling (especially when you win) and with an understanding of the problems you might encounter, I want to share my experiences of football grounds with you so you can feel a bit more confident about stadium accessibility in the future."
1535,"Stratford upon Library is closed for removal of asbestos so after 1 week it has re-opened in a temporary home at the ArtsHouse thanks to the Town Trust.  There is limited  stock, but very helpful staff who will get requested book for the next day, plus 2 computers + a children's corner."
1536,Very friendly and helpful
1537,"Very friendly, helpful and respectful."
1538,level access is through a side door so you need to get a staff member to open it. Otherwise there is one step up to the main entrance.
1539,"If you're keen to attend a Dundee F.C. home game yet you have a disability, fear not as the clubs friendly staff and reasonable accessibility will ensure that your trip goes without a hitch! Sure, access might not be as brilliant as you'll find in other areas of the city, but with the stadium being over 100 years old, the reasons why are understandable. Still, upon my visit to the ground I found everything I needed to make my life as problem-free as possible - with level access entrances at both the home fans end and the away fans end, and accessible toilets too. As previously mentioned, there's always staff members on hand to help with any issues that you may have - and this is true none more so than on match days! "
1540,The Museum is accessible from the main street through a courtyard. There is a ramp and there are doors to enter so that you don't have to navigate the revolving door. The galleries themselves are spacious and each floor is step free. The one thing that may be an issue to some people is that the public lift that we were directed too had very narrow doors. There was a manual wheelchair that was located right next to reception that you can borrow. There is also an audio tour that you can take around with you for more information on the artwork.
1541,Accessing toilet is using radar key. White grab rails around toilet and sink. Toilet is right side transfer. There is a lowered mirror and lowered coat hook. Enough floor space for a powerchair. There are 3 bins in the loo for some reason and a baby changing table even though this ASDA has separate baby changing facilities.
1542,"I highly recommend the House of Dun.  The staff are the loveliest people!  We were told before purchasing our tickets that only the downstairs of the house is accessible for a wheelchair.  The lady working in the shop and the two tour guides treated us like good friends and made us feel so welcomed.  They went above and beyond to talk to us and make sure we were enjoying our visit.  Although not everything is accessible for a wheelchair, there is still plenty of things to see as there are other accessible buildings to tour near the house.  Disabled Parking is very close.  "
1543,"- accessible changing place toilet with special bin for nappies etc
- Euans guide red cord card in accessible bathroom 
- Staff got shower chair for me when I asked
- Accessible wet room in flat"
1544,"A lot has been done to improve access. There are powered doors for wheelchairs at the front, lifts and loos."
1545,Very easy . Rails and plenty of room
1546,Wee bit of a squeeze to get in door but my chair is a bulky chap and it was still do-able. Spotless with all grab rails as you'd expect.
1547,"Access is level to get in, although the doors are quite heavy so you may need someone to help you.  There is a bit more space at the front of the shop, some of which seems to be semi-reserved for wheelchair users. 
As with most coffee shops, its quite tight to get about given lots of chairs, but the front is ok.  Best to have someone with you to go and get the coffees! There was quite a large queue when we were there."
1548,Accessible entrance from Constitution Street. Ramp into restaurant. Decent amount of space for manoeuvring. Tables and chairs all moveable.
1549,Staff were helpful getting things off the shelves. And also helped with packing bags at the checkout.
1550,I approached the Galleria from the London Bridge side. It was easy to wheel in with just a small section of cobbles to wheel over by the arched entrance. Once in the main space it was easy to get around and to go and see the river views.
1551,"The main entrance at the front of the restaurant is not step-free. There is a side entrance which is step-free. It's difficult to reach it, because you have to pass between tightly-packed tables and chairs, and a heavily weighted sunshade-base which blocks the way and is too heavy to move. Having got past these obstacles you reach a side-door and you have to press a doorbell to alert staff that you want to come in. 

Only the back part of the restaurant is step-free, there is a big step down from there to the front part of the restaurant. The front part is not wheelchair-accessible. 

Amazingly, the staff sometimes close off the wheelchair-accessible back part of the restaurant for long periods, which means that no wheelchair user can use the restaurant during those periods."
1552,Are good but a tip for you is to use the toilets outside the halls as the ones inside can get a bit busy. The ones I used seemed big enough for my needs.
1553,"Drop kerb from the car park onto the flat path which goes through the garden and to the entrance. Sloped access to get to inside. No automatic doors but the doors nice and wide

Plenty of space to manoeuvre around with my wheelchair inside (my chair width is 48cm/18.9” excluding the wheels). Well accommodated by the staff who set up the table nicely and made sure we were all okay. "
1554,A wonderful warm welcome. Thank you!
1555,The staff were lovely and couldn't have been better.
1556,"Smiling and aware of the needs of a wheelchair, accepted the access day code for the complimentary drink with no problem."
1557,I am just writing this review as lots of people don’t realise that laser quest is wheelchair accessible since most people go up steps but there is another step free entrance. Just be aware that ramps inside laser quest are a little too steep for comfort personally so although possible to go upstairs in a wheelchair I stayed downstairs 
1558,Staff were very attentive and helpful.
1559,As mentioned this only applies to the lower floor and the attached Street bar.
1560,Helpful but embarrassed by the toilet facilities for disabled away support
1561,"The centre has been newly rebuilt and redesigned in 2016 from the former inverclyde sports centre which was in the same location for many years.

The centre now has large lifts, accessibile sports hall which can be hired for £8 an hour. There are also accessible toilets complete with adult changing bench and hoist. At the moment the change bench is not adjustable. Hopefully this will change soon. The upper floors have accessible sleeping accommodation with hoists and adjoining rooms for  a Personal assistant. From what I saw the beds are not profiling beds."
1562,Staff are very friendly and helpful and always around the venue to ask for help 
1563,"Very friendly, welcoming staff more than happy to accommodate all of our needs."
1564,Flat entrance. All flat inside. Quite roomy so room for wheelchair.  Coffee bar is counter orders which are brought to table. Staff are happy to help at the counter if necessary.  Cafe area is fully waited service.
1565,"Flat and accessible for wheelchairs, has an accessible bus service and disabled car park spaces. The entrance is clear and wide with double automatic doors. 
A ramp to the side of the building with a hand real also promoted easier access. 
"
1566,"Level access into and around homes. Also, room to manoeuvre a mobile hoist, with room under the beds and around sofa’s and a big bathroom with a good shower."
1567,The road and car park was cobbled and would be difficult for a wheelchair user
1568,All staff during our visit were extremely welcoming and very friendly. Gemma was the staff member who presented during our session and she was great.
1569,"We need the facilities of a Cp toilet so all other disabled loos were there but not checked by myself.

I was surprised Duxford didn’t have a CP toilet - I really thought there would be one hiding somewhere!
It just feels like they’ve thought of everything else!
It’s only downside to a second visit I’m afraid."
1570,Located in a very busy part of the city parking is difficult. You can take your car to the entrance gate to allow disabled passengers to enter the Festival; after which you need to park. There are plenty of taxis and buses around so public transport could be a better option.
1571,There is a disabled toilet. However the corridor to the toilet is quite narrow and the disabled toilet is typically used to store many other items that may need to be removed so that you can get in!
1572,"Nice, spacious restaurant at the back of the Glasshouse Hotel in Edinburgh. Good access, although bit of a maze to reach the restaurant!"
1573,"Good paths on the whole, not all of which are surfaced or suitable for wheelchairs. Good online maps are available though which give details of paths. Main route round big pond is mostly OK but not entirely level, and has a few quite steep-ish slopes, which my husband struggled to get me up in manual chair, but we did manage in the end! A few lumpy tree roots to avoid, a few small potholes in places and one or two of the wheelchair bridges have a bit of bump or edge to get on/off, and one of the hides had a ledge/sill across the doorway which we could not cross. But a beautiful place, and very peaceful. Lots of flora and fauna to see. Quiet today, with just a few dog walkers. "
1574,We travelled by bus - the station is 3/4 mile away and the exit has a ramp and after that to the hotel is on the flat. Taxis are very cheap but there is no taxi rank outside the station so look up a number on the internet beforehand. Historic  Armagh sits on top of hills so you could get a taxi to take you up - after that it's flat. I wouldn't recommend the Roman Catholic cathedral - there is a path but it is quite steep going.
1575,"Good sized disabled toilet, contained changing table for babies which considering this venue is super popular with families might lead to a queue"
1576,Brilliant. Everyone that we encountered from the box office staff to the people directing us to our seats were all knowledgeable and helpful. Totally unphased by a patron with access requirements.
1577,Ramp to the door was a little bumpy and doors were not automatic. The lift was broken but being fixed at the time. However staff were very accommodating by taking us in the back entrance.
1578,Nice large clean toilets. Easy to get in an out of.
1579,"Easy to find
No room to menouvor "
1580,"The entrance is flat and generally the front doors are held open when a performance is on, there are also theatre/security staff at the doors.

Anyone requiring accessibility assistance is advised to go to the main desk just inside the front door, and a member of staff will then help you.

This theatre has a lot of stairs! Though in the theatre itself there is more leg-room at the seats, than is found in several other theatres.
Wheelchair access is via a lift at the stage door, which you are taken to by staff.
(I did not personally see/use the lift)

The stalls are tiered, at the back is two removable seats (row S), which can accommodate two wheelchairs instead. This did not seem particularly spacious, especially if it were two power- wheelchairs being used. However, because the seats are tiered/on levels, the view from here is actually very good, and quite central to the stage. 

There are also three seats people can use if transferring from their wheelchair/scooter, and these will get stored for them.
"
1581,"Easy to get into, and around, the café, lovely helpful staff, a great accessible toilet with an agreeable surprise in it."
1582,Two steps at front entrance negotiable by portable ramp but this is to be improved.  A disabled bedroom is having ramped access directly into room from car park.  There is room to navigate around the hotel by wheelchair.
1583,Very friendly staff. They informed us that from March 2018 you'll have to book before visiting.
1584, Very easy access . 
1585,"Very helpful and friendly, keepers were doing talks about their animals too which was very interesting."
1586,There are 2 seating areas. One is a fenced off area on the upper concourse and the entrance is a step free opening. This is where we sat and from there you have nice views of the station. There is a covered roof and heaters and in February when we visited it felt warm sitting here. There is also a inside seating area. Both areas have free standing tables and chairs and the entire restaurant is step free.
1587,Peggy Porschen is a café specialising  in ornately decorated cakes. They have 2 branches Chelsea and Belgravia. This review is for their Belgravia café. 
1588,Access was through automatic doors taking you into New Look and then via a roomy lift to Starbucks. Plenty space throughout for manoeuvring into and around the tables; the only possible downside was the previously noted lift button. 
1589,"The disabled toilet is on the ground floor (a lift is available), and is a good size and well maintained."
1590,I arrived at the museum from using public transport. It was easy to find the museum and only around ten minutes wheeling from the railway station. There were accessible parking bays in the streets along side the museum.
1591,"Disabled Car parking for 4 cars outside just before bus stop, but often full. However there are 3 or 4 parking spaces beside the Traverse Theatre.
There are numerous buses that either stop outside or by The Caledonian Hotel or St John's Church (200m away uphill)."
1592,"The patio paving in front of the main door was very uneven in a few places so take care on foot.  As I approached the front door a staff member immediately opened the double doors for me which was very helpful. The floor was level, apart from the small threshold at the door (easy to see). There are no steps. Inside, transitions between carpet and smoothe flooring have clear safety strips to reduce trip hazards. There was plenty of room to move about inside even though it was busy. When i booked a table in the bar I was helpfully asked if I would like to stay in my wheelchair or transfer."
1593,"Huge wetrooms with shower, roll under sink, and plenty of grabrails."
1594,Staff throughout  the venue were welcoming and happy to answer questions and point me in the right direction.
1595,"The staff and volunteers are always very helpful and cheerful, they all knew what Disabled Access Day was and give the information that was needed to go with  it."
1596,Colyton village where the tea rooms is located is about a 10 - 15 minute walk from Colyton Tram Station. 
1597,"The whole building is accessible.  There are two lifts both easy to operate and staff are on hand to help if needed.  There is ample, comfortable seating. "
1598,Easy to find identify and ask so helpful
1599,Other than difficulty with the door the disabled toilet is roomy and clean
1600,"The toilet I saw was a little tight for space and I couldn't see an emergency cord, but it was very clean and brightly lit."
1601,Staff were helpful when we asked for information.
1602,"I purposely park in a blue badge area that is right outside the main entrance of the food hall of M&S. There are other blue badge parking bays, but they are too far from main entrances for me."
1603,We were attending a reception on The Terrace. Our taxi was allowed to drop us off in a restricted area and then we were pointed towards the normal ramp leading down to security and were told that they would take us through quickly and then guide us to our reception. We had to wait about 15 minutes in the queue heading towards screening (luckily it was not raining) and then we were quickly and gently screened. We were then taken through the back corridors to our reception. Everywhere was wheelchair friendly with the exception of the step onto The Terrace itself. Staff were very alert to our needs and difficulties and even staff who were not involved with us were amenable to helping us out when we asked for assistance. There are not than many disability friendly toilets but the one near Westminster Hall is very good and an audio track tells you where everything is inside the toilet. We had to wait outside of one Disabled Toilet whilst a member of the catering staff was using it (she was appropriately embarrassed when they came out and found us waiting).
1604,All on one level fully accessible with profiling bed and accessible bathroom with shower chair.
1605,Wheelchair Accessible Theatre
1606,"Very low(about 2 inch) step to enter. Once inside good disabled access to all apart from 1 small room. Easy ramp to disabled loo. Very old building with preservation order, so anything larger than a standard hand wheelchair would struggle to get to loo. Otherwise good access"
1607,"This is a town centre location,  & has no parking. However there are near by car parks only a short distance from the venue. "
1608,"I booked ahead as I needed a wheelchair space and a companion seat. You can’t book the wheelchair spaces online so I emailed them and they rang me back a few minutes later. They take seats out in some screens, others have spaces anyway. 
The disabled loo is great, with all the usual rails, room to turn a wheelchair round, and the door is sliding with an easy lock, which was good as I’m always frightened of being locked in!
There is a big car park alongside the Kinema but a bit gravelly ( not impossible as not deep) but you can park almost outside too - not marked disabled as such, but staff don’t mind.
Inside, the screens are small, but Screen One on a Sat night has the man playing the old organ, which comes up out of the floor in the Interval. Sometimes he plays other days and other screens, so best to check.
They sell tea and coffee which you can take in with you too!
Lovely place. I go often."
1609,"Not very impressive as you approach car park, a bit untidy around farm area, it’s just an old concerted farm building, in need of repair and tidy up. One or two pots on display outside, but not inspiring and expensive. 
The entrance door into shop had no step, but a pull door. Very limited stock displayed in cardboard boxes, grey painted concrete floor, in need of a tidy and repair work to be done. 
The plants however for sale were in good condition, looked after, and a fair variety. also the hanging baskets for sale were colourful and in good condition.
Our final thoughts.
Did not inspire us to buy anything, a bit of a journey for just a few minutes walk through."
1610,There is no specific disabled parking.  People have to be dropped off on the hill leading up to the Castle Esplanade. Parking is available on Johnston Terrace and in the car park at the foot of that street.
1611,Fairly easy access despite many tables and chairs. Watch your knuckles.
1612,"I spoke to one member of staff. She was vague, didn't understand how the humps at the entrances could be an obstruction, and didn't take my comments at all seriously. She was also unapologetic, over-casual, about the lack of accessible toilet provision. Not impressed at all."
1613,"All very friendly, busy, but willing to offer help."
1614,Very wheelchair friendly
1615,"Venue let down by lack of disabled parking.  It is on the main street but we parked not far up the road, about 100 metres from the hotel.
The Linton had been off limits to disabled guests because of the upstairs restaurant. Word had got round that it now had a ground floor dining area.
We were met by Pat, the owner, who showed us to our table and adjusted the furniture to suit our needs. The dining area looked to have been recently refurbished and was light and airy. We were offered an alternative table under which we could get the wheelchair but kept to our original position."
1616,"Parking is on the street in the side road. Depending on the time of day you can park near the entrance, there is also a good bus service from Edinburgh to the town and the bus stops on the high street."
1617,"Excellent manner, welcomed as soon as we entered. A professional interaction and smiling disposition, helpful but not overbearing."
1618,"There are lots of accessible toilets in the building, there are many around the arena.

All that I saw were roomy enough to have a wheelchair and carer in, if required.
Baby changing facilities were not sharing this space.

I noticed in several of them though, the emergency pull-cords were tucked in behind things, so could be out of reach if someone needed them.
"
1619,Had very little dealings with staff but certainly found staff friendly and helpful enough.
1620,A beautiful moated manor house ( currently being renovated in places) with lovely grounds and woodland walks
1621,We got in with the power chair but only just! Door frame is quite narrow. Would help a lot if door opened out.
1622,"On street parking directly outside but can sometimes be difficult finding a parking space as there didn't seem to be designated accessible parking spaces. 
Public transport - bus stop nearby but unsure of what number bus."
1623,This is a relatively new location of the chain and the inside is quite cramped but has a decent accessible toilet.
1624,We were lucky as we found a spot right outside the level access gate. There is some on street parking nearby but it is often busy. It is right on the corner of the Meadows so there are plenty of bus routes nearby.
1625,Whole shop is accessible but signage could be improved and wider gangways would help.
1626,"There is parking immediately in front of the store. Although there are a few spaces, the surface is gravel which can be a little tricky to negotiate. There are no designated accessible bays."
1627,"I’ve been here numerous times and the staff are brilliant. I’ve attended both events in the standard accessible wheelchair areas as well as in the hospitality boxes. If attending the hospitality boxes it’s best if you can let them know you’re in a wheelchair in advance and they can adapt the seating area by moving the bar table along so you can fit a wheelchair in the back row. The staff are amazing and I feel they’re very disabled confident. Toilets in the area itself are very accessible for a wheelchair, with some being extra big. The seating area within the arena is great too and they provide a foldable seat for your companion. 

Security has defiantly got better, as they have a specific entrance for wheelchair users and give you a pat down before entering. 

Parking is a little bit of a distance but if you aren’t a wheelchair user but may have issues with the distance, you can arrange for them to escort you from your car in a wheelchair and back at the end of the event. 

The pathway from the car park to the venue is very accessible, however when crossing at the traffic lights there is a very steep ramp to the road, but I usually cross up further by the zebra crossings, as otherwise it’s a bit scary in my chair. 

The only gripes I have with the venue are that if you need the toilet before entering the venue, there is only 1 disabled toilet below the cinema and this is often misused by people not wanting to queue for the ladies toilets. It’s best to wait, if you can, until you get into the arena itself.

Also there are only 2 lifts (together) to take you up to the seating on the first floor or hospitality boxes and these often result in long queues and people running infront of you to get in the lifts. The staff do try and ask people to use escalators and stairs where they can instead, but be prepared to wait a long time to get downstairs after an event.

Overall this is my go-to venue for access as a wheelchair user, and previously as an ambulant disabled person. "
1628,"Fully level accessible shower en suite , ample space and appropriately adjustable wash basin. Plenty of grab rails."
1629,With e-motion wheels and a freewheel the path of compact gravel for accessible for us. Some minor gradients. Gates all passable. From Bailey's Hard to Buckler's Hard there is a 'Direct' route recommended for cyclists. Take this as it avoids the steps on and off boardwalks and also a few areas with large tree roots. 
1630,Clean and tidy standard disabled toilet with a radar lock. 
1631,A small park with good paths which is well maintained and close to Derwent Water.
1632,"The loo is easily accessible, clearly signposted and beautifully appointed, with mirrors at appropriate heights and sturdy handrails. The emergency pull reaches just above the floor. Everything is very clean and 'grown-up' - what a joy!"
1633,"There's level access throughout the hotel, including ramps and lifts where necessary, and when it appeared at first that there might be a difficulty in one restaurant on two levels, we were soon directed to a different way in. The very nice accessible pool was a pleasant surprise, and in general I felt that the hotel lived up to the commitment to accessibility that it makes on its website."
1634,"once on the pedestrian area it is level however some of the slabs are uneven.
The bank has an automatic door that slides open to allows you to enter and leave the bank its self 
Areas with in the bank  can be clearly seen with the teller points to the left as you enter there are also a number of cash points located with in the bank these are also clearly seen as you enter.
There is a reception desk as you enter the bank and a small waiting area if you have an appointment etc. please note that these seats are low and do not have arm rests on them. 

There are signs on the door for induction loop system being available as well as assistance dogs"
1635,The staff at the post office and in the NISA Local were all very friendly
1636,No parking and public transport is not great in Covent Garden if you are in a wheelchair so we went by taxi from Waterloo but wheeled back.
1637,Disabled Parking and public transport is excellent at the Trafford centre 
1638,There are plenty of disabled spaces  available if you are travelling by your own transport.
1639,"The upstairs is completely flat and accessible, but there's a basement area with no lift access. The seats are a mix of high and low tables. Front doors could be a bit heavy but there's a helpful security guard to hold them open."
1640,Disabled loos on ground floor.  clean
1641,"Friendly, happily carry your drink anywhere. If you can't reach payment points for cards, they'll bring things around."
1642,"My husband, two friends & me went to this restuarant for a meal & had a lovely time. The access was all good although there was a car park with large chips we had to negotiate to get to the kitchen where we had our meal. All the staff were amazing & very helpful. "
1643,Viewing felt limited. Only one accessible toilet outside on the level.
1644,"The only reason for 2 stars only, is because of the difficulty to get to the Spa building, but otherwise it is a very lovely place to take advantage of this quiet Spa and pool building. Sadly the Spa is not disabled friendly unless you can manage a longish walk along a path of chippings,  as pushing a wheelchair would be very difficult, but we include the review here which may benefit your family members while visiting this lovely old medieval hotel.

The Spa is set in its own area, situated in enchanting gardens and delightful pools, and 26 acres of woodland walks and pasture land. With its modern facilities of a large swimming pool, sauna, hot tub, steam room, and modern Gym, it still manages to hold its charm and elegance, and blends in well with the medieval hotel itself, which is surrounded by open spaces and woodland walks, first introduced as a hunting lodge in the 13th century, now with 26 acres for you to wander through, taking along your canine companion in this dog friendly hotel.

A delightful well maintained Moat surrounds this hotel (photo 1) and a paved pathway from the car park, (photo 2) leads towards the hotels main entrance, (photo 3) which is on the flat, then a double door awaits you to pull open.
This leads you to the hotel reception, and a hallway (photo 4) which will lead to the separate Spa building.  The path crosses the moat (photo 5).  
After going out of the hotel, you have to go down half a dozen steps (photo 6)  and there is no ramp available, and a long hard slog would await the carer to pull you over the deep chippings. Sadly, even though the Spa is set in beautiful settings and a lovely old building, (photo 7) we cannot recommend this for disabled people. 
For an able bodied companion, there is a very attractive large swimming pool available (photo 8) and a hot tub., as well as a sauna.
The Gym has a good selection of equipment including weights (photo 9) and treadmills (photo 10).
To cool off after your training, there are delightful woodland walks (photo 11) passing many lovely pools, which lead to pasture lands (photo 12).

Our final thoughts
Sadly, not for a disabled person, as far to difficult to reach the Spa and pool, steep steps, heavy going dragging you across chippings that pass a lovely little pond, nicely laid out area, and wonderful woodland walks.  So we cannot in any way recommend the Spa to you. (BUT DO SEE OUR REVIEW OF NEW HALL HOTEL AS THIS IS A DELIGHTFUL HOTEL IN ITSELF)


"
1645,"Usually good access to parking, but can be limited near the hall."
1646,"Parking is on grass (not hard standing) across the drive way immediately in front of the cottages.    Spaces are not reserved for each cottage, so where you can park may depend to some extent on other guests but I am sure if you needed to park as close as possible this could be arranged. I have ""a drive chair"" from car and I just had to be a bit careful that my ramp was coming down on the drive rather than the uneven grass.     
I would say you need a car to stay at this property as it is very rural and a car drive to shops, eating places etc."
1647,"The queue for the cathedral was awkward. They hadn't thought about wheelchair access in the queue - several mounting and dismounting high kerbs. Once inside though access was mostly excellent. We were given an access map, which was easy to follow and worked well. There were a few parts I couldn't get to but mostly I could see everything I wanted to."
1648,"Initially I had emailed them but received no reply so I telephoned to reserve a table at their café before the performance. When we arrived there was a table with my name on the 1st floor and time of booking on it. When I ordered my food at the café the staff the staff were amazingly helpful and friendly. They were proactive when they saw my crutch, asked where I was sitting and said that they would take my tray of food up to my table. The waiter got up the stairs and had put the food on the table before I arrived back via the lift. At the interval the café was very busy and the staff served everyone very quickly. Again seeing my crutch they offered to carry my food but as my cake was in a box I didn't need help carrying it."
1649,All the staff I've come across in each separate building in the retail park are very friendly and approachable. They're always pleased to help.
1650,"The church has its own car park with 3 accessible bays right by the door (a lot of spaces as it is a fairly small car park) car park is flat and smooth surface

Close to a bus route - couple of minutes away"
1651,This is a newly refurbished station and it's amazing.
1652," Parking facilities right outside the restaurant or nearby.

If you have a car driver and disabled it would be useful to be in possession of a blue badge."
1653,The accommodation was extremely suitable for our wheelchair user.  We were met by Rob on arrival who was very friendly and informative not just about the facilities in the cottage but also about the local attractions.  Good sized wet room in the downstairs bedroom.  The door from the lounge into the porch opens both ways which is ideal for a wheelchair user.  As well as  a profile bed provided there was also a shower chair.
1654,There is a car park right next to the canal with accessible pathways. Disabled spaces are available but limited in number.
1655,Accessible pub on Bread Street
1656,Friendly and willing to help with doors.
1657,Cafe staff friendly and patient while I  made my choice.
1658,"Booking office staff always helpful.
On the night  staff will do their best to take you to you seat and ask if you need any help. "
1659,"Small public gardens, next to the entrance to the Old Fortress. Originally known as Bosketto Gardens, but was re-named Bosketto Durrell in 2016, in honour of the writers Gerald and Lawrence Durrell. "
1660,"The nature reserve is situated just past Brusnwick village approximately 6 miles outside of Newcastle city. It is part of the Northumberland wildlife trust (NWT). There are two hides and a viewing area but these are kept locked and accessible only by joining the NWT, which costs £30 a year plus £10 for a key.
There is a car park which is free, and entrance to the reserve is also free. You can reach the reserve from Newcastle city on the no 45 bus from the Haymarket bus station, getting off near Sandy lane which apparently brings you to within 450ft of Sandy lane - the reserve is down a road, one field long.

So as the reserve is split in two - part free and part for NWT members I will keep those two areas in separate paragraphs - firstly the free area.

There is a map in the car park showing routes. There are a couple of routes you can take to look around, one goes down to the lake and is fairly accessible in a wheelchair or mobility scooter, although it is a rough path and bumpy. The easiest path is down to the lake, which is fairly short ( a few hundred ft)., this path loops around to met the other path, but I found that the section after the first bridge is difficult terrain - too hard to navigate on my scooter so I turned back and tried the other path.  The next path was partially through a small amount of woodlands,  on a muddy, uneven path which led to a board walk - again requiring a step up, which I managed to get my scooter up, but Im sure this would be difficult for most in wheelchairs or on scooters.   I managed to get to another bridge and needed assistance on the other side of the bridge where the path goes partially around the lake - I would not recommend this part for anyone in a wheelchair or on a mobility scooter, its just far too rough and uneven. Personally I would only recommend this to wheelchair and scooter users going down to the lake, which is only a very short trip, but its the only area I feel is safely navigated, however after heavy rain, mud could make this unsafe. I would definitely recommend taking someone who can assist in case of getting stuck. It is a nice lake, fairly picturesque, although we saw very little wildlife, the woodlands are nice too. If all you are wanting is to get out for half an hour to an hour and be surrounded by nature then it could be a good option. There are no toilet facilities or cafe.

For the NWT access you need to backtrack up the road until you find the first field on the right, take this path to the end of the woods then to the end of the field, there is a right turn taking down the side of a field into woodlands. The path after the road and along the two fields is rough and bumpy, it drained the power in my scooter rapidly and was very uncomfortable despite being flat, but it was doable - just. Surprisingly this is apparently listed as wheelchair accessible! It was hard work on a scooter and I have no doubt that it would be hard work on a power or manual wheelchair, in muddy weather I would suggest avoiding it, and again I would only attempt it again if I have a strong, able bodied assistant. At the end of these two paths though there is a board walk which provides easy access along to the dipping pond and main bird hide. The hide is locked, but we purchased a key along with our membership to the NWT, it is accessible by a short ramp and is easy to get into for both wheelchairs and scooters. Inside there is plenty of room and they even have some spaces where a wheelchair user can pull their chair up to the viewing areas without having to get onto the benches. There are views into a large bird feeding area on one side and over the reeds and lake on the other side. There are comfortable cushions on the benches too. As usual in hides there are no toilet facilities. There is another hide apparently just off the boardwalk, also locked, which I did not manage to visit this time, but I was told it was along rough track but not far. I will check this out another time."
1661,"We found it easy enough to move around in the hotel and see everything we needed to, but upstairs will of course be out of bounds for you, as being a grade 1 building there will be no lift provided, but the important areas are on the ground floor. 
Bedroom use will not be practical, even if you can cope with steps, so we recommend just a days visit here, which we feel you will really enjoy."
1662,Disabled parking spaces at front of building.  McGills bus service no 26 runs past building with stops directly outside.
1663,"Parking immediately outside the house and easy to stop/drop off away from or close to the kerb, depending on needs of passengers."
1664,"Couldn't be more helpful, friendly and polite. "
1665,Close to wheelchair accessible bus network. Disabled badge holder on street parking is available near the venue. 
1666,The journey along the river is very pretty and there is enough to spend two half days ( or one full day) enjoying the attractions at either end (rare breeds farm one end and otters and butterflies and station facilities at the other). There is also a miniature outdoor railway and river walks if you don't mind some grassy path sections. Train is very easy to access at Buckfastleigh which has the better station facilities.
1667,Very helpful
1668,"The front door was already open, which was good. Also the front door does have a small lip to be aware of. Once inside everything is on the same level. We were seated at the back of the restaurant which suited us great as were close to the toilet and as they only have the one meant we could see when it was occupied or free. Only slight issue was when we were leaving we went to go the way we had arrived along the right hand side of the restaurant, which because it was now full, was impassable. So we excited via the left which was fine."
1669,"Easily accessible, and staff are extremely helpful!"
1670,"Entrance to the mall via carparks consists of lifts and stairs. The entire mall has limited slopes and plenty of lifts for access to all three levels of the mall. To purchase the movie tickets, the ticket booth is high up and behind glass which may be difficult for staff to communicate and see a wheel chair user. However there are also electronic machines, located to the left, which all customers can access.  The doors to the movie theatres pull out, so if a wheel chair user is alone the may need assistance. The theatre has spaces for service users to park their wheelchair. Next to the wheelchair space are reserved setting for two other people. 
The mall’s food court has multiply tables and chairs you can move around making it easy to make space for my friend’s wheelchair. We ate at Gengis Khan which is delicious Mongolian Barbeque food. The counter was a bit high, but my friend was able to manage seeing and ordering the food with no assistance. 
"
1671,"There looked to be a good sized accessible loo at the back of the cafe, and it was easy to access. I didn't use it as it was occupied."
1672,Direct access into the front door is fine with no steps. Once inside it's very busy and quite tight. Both things can't be helped for such a small place in the city centre. 
1673,Access is generally very good although some aisles were a little tight or you had to navigate past a few extra rails that were out.
1674,"Clean and functional, available on court level and also cafe level."
1675,The Art Centre itself does not provide parking facilities however a short walk away (200m) on the Tuesday Market Place there are disabled parking spaces available.
1676,"At the main entrance  on Piccadilly there is a short flight of stairs down into the main shop. Next to this is a platform lift. I had used it previously and found it to be jerky to use. On my most recent visit I decided to go down the stairs as it has a hand rail, in preference to using the lift. I'm mindful that not everyone will have a choice so it would be appreciated if the lift could be upgraded. There are lifts to all floors, but sometimes they take a while to arrive.  "
1677,"Its more that its complicated. And the ramp getting in feels pretty unsafe.  Once you're in and know where you're going its ok. Needs better signage. 

Wheelchair entrance is in the side street."
1678,"To all the numpties who say that old buildings cannot be made accessible, just go to The Works and see how it can be done. There is a ramp into the restaurant and a decent accessible loo."
1679,"Not too sure, we drove here and parked around the corner."
1680,"Two identified parking spaces at the rear, by the toilets. Plenty of flat parking to the front too."
1681,Wheelchair access is pretty decent at this station. All the platforms can be accessed in a wheelchair. 
1682,"On my visit, the staff appeared to be helpful. They always seemed to be on the lookout for any problems we may have experienced when using the wheelchair, for example, watching when entering through the cafe entrance to ensure they are ready if any assistance is required. They genuinely seemed happy to assist. "
1683,"The site is accessible to mobility scooter and power chair. Stone tracks are wide and I can easily manoeuver my big Tramper Scooter  around all of the site. Its all flat, so I don't even need the Tramper's hill climbing capabilities. DTL is accessible by gently sloping ramps. I don't take the Tramper into the shooting stands, but you can get a power chair into them. They are roofed over, so shooting in the rain is no problem."
1684,Southampton is well serviced with car parks. Local transport is largely accessible. 
1685,The sporting grounds is located just outside the town centre. It consists of a playing field and a small complex with changing rooms and toilets.
1686,"Homelands consists of 3 units sleeping a maximum of 6 and one sleeping 8.  I spent a week in Massney, a six bed.  This purpose built accommodation is extremely well equipped with OH tracking hoists covering all areas of one bedroom and the wet room.  A profiling bed with air-mattress was supplied and free-standing hoists are available.  The wet room is very well equipped with all manner of shower chairs etc.  The views over Lundin Golf Course and the Firth of Forth to Mid and East Lothian are breathtaking and best appreciated from the picnic tables and chairs on the patio outside the French Windows. The accommodation is spacious with all surfaces at a good height for wheelchair users."
1687,Not used but looked in and seemed perfect.
1688,"Enter Summerhall from the side entrance in Summerhall Square; the pavement is quite narrow and was blocked when visited by discarded wood. Follow the ramp signs on the other side of the courtyard to enter the building then turn right and right again,  and the toilets are signposted on the left."
1689,Very accessible and free for boat trip if in chair 
1690,"Outstandingly helpful. The lady who sold us our tickets asked whether the wheelchair was powered and when we said ""no"" gave the accompanist free entry. She also gave us clear directions about where the lifts are. Every time we approached a door, a member of staff rushed to open it."
1691,"Many of the exhibits was reachable in a wheelchair, although there were manual doors to access bird exhibits, and the doorway at the Otters wasn't wide enough to allow wheelchair into it.  There was no provisions at all for hearing impairments, and some staff did not have comprehension to understand the difficulties for the disabled. "
1692,Small step at front door but very good.
1693,Great to be able to park outside the door! Buses also stop nearby if coming by public transport.
1694,"Given 4 stars as they had a disabled loo which is a rare thing in restaurants. So used to places not having any that i didn't think to try it out , so  my rating maybe under or over the actual facility!"
1695,"There is only one accessible loo which is clean and well maintained with grab rails.  It has enough room for me to manoeuvre my wheelchair and for a carer, but can get busy at times."
1696,"The paths are particularly flat, with one or two minor exceptions in very wet weather. We visit here 2-3 times a year sometimes with a manual chair and sometimes a powerchair."
1697,Everyone was so helpful and friendly.
1698,"There were toilets signposted but I didnt try them, sorry!"
1699,"My experience has been based on two occasions both have been very good experiences with caring staff, very good seating for people who use wheelchairs and they are part of the hynt card system in Wales which enables a carer to be free with the person who requires help. The hynt card is free and covers many venues in Wales so is well worth getting."
1700,We walked but there were buses stopping close by.
1701,"The staff are lovely, eager to help, eager to explain and inform, so they made it a happy experience."
1702,Good parking. easy access with wheelchair into centre from car park.
1703,"Great experience overall - the staff were friendly, there was step free access to where we needed to go and there was a good sized accessible loo. There are also some interesting facts behind some of the paintings on display!"
1704,Good parking and enteaces. Good to have the additional option of moving the car to museum so all options are available.
1705,"The uneven surfaces and cobbles render the visit a very challenging experience for many wheelchair users. If you have a mid wheel drive powerchair you'll probably be fine over the uneven terrain but other wheelchairs may well struggle as I did. The signage is good but the sight lines from a wheelchair aren't great to see the signs. Not a venue I'd visit again for fear of damaging the delicate electronics and mechanics of my powerchair. Getting in to the performance venue was fine as there was a side entrance used by performers and which was ramped. It was a little steep so some folk might need a hand going up and down. Once inside, the front row had tip up seats and you could choose your spot."
1706,The disabled toilet was clean and spacious ensuring that there is enough room for a wheelchair. It was sign posted well and highlighted. 
1707,"The disabled toilet is easy to find and there are two available within the building, one upstairs and one downstairs."
1708,"Very helpful, the place has been open less than a week so they are just getting started. But they were very knowledgeable and willing to help with anything!"
1709,"The building has its own car-park underneath it, with marked disabled bays.
You reach the car-park by driving in through the Co-op supermarket car-park. Both have a fairly low ceiling height, fine for most vehicles, but good to highlight just in-case.

A lift goes from the car-park into the doctors building (shared car-park and lift for both practices)

The doctors isn't far from the town centre, and a short distance from the train station, where as well as trains, there is a local bus stop and a taxi rank. "
1710,"I didn't go into the toilet but I did see it. The door seemed wide enough for most chairs. No grab rails or anything but possibly just enough space to transfer from a chair. There is a bath, but nothing to assist use. Non weight bearers might struggle to use the facilities."
1711,Plenty of disabled spaces near to the entrance.
1712,Next has very good access. 3 floors of clothes and a spacious lift takes you between all the floors.
1713,Very helpful friendly staff
1714,"Very large full equipped disabled toilet with fixed and fold down rails, room for wheelchair and to transfer. Wide door."
1715,Very friendly 
1716,"Level entry from the disabled parking, no troubling slopes or potholes. No seating for a rest but possible to take the lift up to the cafe and get a coffee etc when tired. "
1717,"Toilet quite large, only problem is a sliding door to get into the bathroom ( which slides shut by itself ) you may need someone to hold it open, but the disabled toilet is great."
1718,Pretty much non existent if you want food. You have to travel into Lostock by foot for half an hour and go all the way round to where there are no steps. There are no benches or seats outside to have a rest. The staff know it is bad but cant do anything about it.
1719,"There is a ramp at the side leading up to the restaurant, which is on the small side.  It was crowded and took a bit of negotiating (but that may have been because it was  Easter & a Sunday)."
1720,"We actually stayed here more than once, but we rented a cottage which allowed our daughter and son in law, and granddaughter to stay with us for period. My wife who was disabled has since 
passed away but we remember our stays here. They can't do enough for you. Whatever your requirements are they will supply or arrange. I can't say anything against staying here. We tried a a place in Dumfries area, i wanted to check areas in my family tree, but were disappointed ."
1721,"Helpful staff, will open the room if not already unlocked on request. "
1722,"Lovely flat entrance, albeit the doors are not automatic. Wide double doors, staff greet you as you enter and will hand you a menu. You choose your pizza or build your own depending on what you fancy. Then you move along a self-serve style counter where different members of the team will construct your pizza and chat to you along the way. You collect your pizza on a tray at the end and take it to your table, but I've never met such friendly staff, so I'm certain they would offer to carry it to your table for you should you require assistance. 

The restaurant is super spacious, and there is a fantastic selection of seating (high and low seats), group tables, or benches which are great for individual use with plug sockets and USB ports. 

Windows line the wall which means it is light and bright, and the atmosphere is surprisingly chilled."
1723,"Had a lovely stay away with my support worker had a great time, lots of disability aids which were very helpful also great sensory room too 🙂"
1724,Back entrance was accessible with a lift. Wide doorways and corridors. The bed was quite low but I am sure they would find a work around for this if you let them know the required bed height in advance.
1725,"There is a  short paved path and then a ramp to enter the premises. In places the path is slightly uneven, which wasn't a problem with a wheelchair, but might be more difficult for those unsteady on their feet. The wheel of the chair did get briefly stick, however, in a gap between two paving stones at the top of the ramp.

Inside, the eating area was spacious with room to put a wheelchair up to the tables. A small part of this area was up steps, but there were many tables on the level.

You order and pay for meals at the bar before eating. "
1726,"Can't comment on parking. Lothian Buses 2,3,4,25,33 and 44 serve nearby bus stops and there is a pedestrian crossing controlled by lights for those alighting from a bus heading westwards."
1727,"Excellent service provided by attentive staff, good menu and something for every one, great range of drinks all reasonably priced . Plenty of parking available. No issues a fantastic place for families and all ages."
1728,"Wasnt very clear, far away from main streets "
1729,The restaurant is located on St Marks Road which is a busy inner city street. There is no off street parking however there are a number of disabled bays on St Marks Road itself.
1730,"The toilet is located through the barriers and on platform 1. As you come through the electric doors it is on the right. Toilet is locked with a radar key. This toilet was tiny. There was a large bin in the transfer space and there was no space to turn around in my large power chair. There were grab rails around the sink. There was no mirror or hook. Toilet flush handle was small.

There are other loos on other platforms."
1731,The ground floor is fully accessible - so that's the cafe and a part of the gallery. Upstairs gallery isn't accessible - a flight of stairs with a slid handrail. But plenty to look at in shop and ground floor area while waiting or chill out with magazines and newspapers in the snug
1732,"A large car park to the side of the building with plenty of parking and disabled bays are marked.It is about 30 minutes from Doncaster train station by foot,it is also on a bus route but not to sure which one."
1733,"The staff are very nice, but they do use the disabled loo"
1734,Disabled parking with badge right next to ground
1735,"Private disabled toiled facilities are large, clean and totally accessable"
1736,"Accessed via the lifts which bring you out almost at the entrance to Starbucks. There are lots of different seating options, from a breakfast bar to round tables."
1737,"George, our 10 year old, with Aspergers said ""They treat us like normal, I love it here!""  

Anthony 6, our non verbal son had a whale of a time, feeding the animals, running around followed by the staff and having someone stand in the sea with him on a wet day for nearly 2 hours.

Our other son Alfie 7 had a great time just being himself.

We got a surprise afternoon off with a picnic from the staff, a bottle of bubbly and no children to go off and chill. 

Non-judgemental, with mentoring that helps you see how different approaches can aid everyday life.

The week had structure but activities evolved according to everyone's needs. Nothing was too much trouble and a passionate team who are there to provide the best time for everyone!

Can't wait to return to the best holiday we have ever had as a family!

Thank you, a true gem Kerry Farm!"
1738,"Two large single unisex rooms, handrails around toilet, lever-operated faucets, no changing table or diapering station"
1739,"Short but steep slope to the ticket office with a bend halfway down for good measure! 
Concession tickets available for carers.
Gated entrance onto mainly tarmac pathways, some quite narrow pathways and steep hills.
Negotiable with a manual wheelchair but help may be needed on a couple of the shorter slopes and one steep longer slope. Some areas not suitable for mobility scooters due to gradient and/or camber but there is a marked accessible path on a map given at the entrance.
Benches at regular intervals for a rest.
One pathway stops at the upper balcony of the cafe building and you have to turn around and retrace your steps. There used to be a lift here to the lower level but it has been removed.
A small tropical house at one end has a metal threshold/lip and hard to open manual door, plus another to enter the environment. Narrow but navigable pathway around.
Manual door into small cafe but large balcony area outside reached by manual doors with lip. 
Very little wheelchair turning space onto balcony but just about manageable with my active manual chair. 
A second larger cafe is downstairs with large outside seating area next to an attractive pond. 
All dogs welcome with water bowls available.
Small but well stocked gift shop, easily navigable by wheelchair."
1740,three fully accessible toilets including a bed and hoist
1741,Very helpful staff
1742,Very helpful staff from booking by phone to arrival and being seated.
1743,Staff were helpful and friendly.
1744,The disabled parking for the gardens is located at the far end on the opposite side from the disabled toilets and café. This means you have to go up a long hill to access any of the amenities. This is ok but if you'd had a long journey to get there and needed the loo you'd have a fair trek to get there.
1745,"I believe it has disabled parking, however I have not used it. Transport connections from Farringdon Tube station (about 15 min push) and bus routes is very good."
1746,"The staff at reception directed me to the library. There are two woman who facilitate the book club meeting. They were welcoming, inclusive and very engaging. The group is informal members were able to participate if and when they wanted.  The book under discussion was The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon, with a central character who has Asperger's syndrome."
1747,"Brand new accessible wet room on ground floor, with handles and grab rails. Wheel-in chair for shower, raised loo-seat and rails."
1748,Unfriendly!!  
1749,Very attentive and welcoming theatre staff. Made our trip!
1750,Door was a bit heavy but otherwise ok.
1751,Generally great - there are cobbles at the start of the tour but they soon give way to tiled access. The Museum is all on one level. The exhibits are at a good height. There is a free audio guide if you would like it. You're able to try on kit which is a genius idea! And the best bit of all - the window into the real horses stable.
1752,"There is an accessible loo, although this was a little tight for the scooter I was using which is 50cm wide - just managed to manoeuvre in. "
1753,Close to the bus stop with regular buses into Edinburgh city centre. There looked to be a couple of parking spaces nearby but we didn't have a car with us so didn't take too much notice.
1754,"We found the staff to be polite and efficient.  They took time in taking the order and assisted in removing a seat to accommodate my wheelchair, even when the café was busy."
1755,"Amazing food, value for money.Visited for lunch, unfortunately had to sit in the wind and the rain whilst someone came to open the wheelchair accessible entrance, even though we had booked our table and they were aware a wheelchair user was coming"
1756,MRC is accessed via road and has it's own small tarmac car park. There is one disabled space next to the main front door. 
1757,Staff were very helpful and friendly.
1758,No changing table for those that would need one
1759,"People in wheelchairs should not attempt the entrance on their own but once inside, there is a (small) lift to the dining area where people are the only obstacles."
1760," I only stayed for five days this time whilst work was done at my home and I had to get out of the way, but the length of stay did not, in any way, diminish my holiday.  As always, in my experience, everyone, volunteer or staff member, went out of their way to ensure I had a great holiday.  The food again was excellent, both in house and when we went to the pub.  The nurses quietly kept an eye on my medication. The carers kept an eye on my capabilities so far as getting up and going to bed was concerned.  I worked with the Physio team each day which is always valuable.  We had varied but good entertainment each evening.  And to be there when there was a meeting of Patrons and the Board, which enabled us to meet the Princess Royal and Gavin Hastings was a particular bonus."
1761,"It is generally busy to park as it's in city of Glasgow, and this is a popular event. There will be spaces, but you may need to drive about to find them!
There were some disabled parking spaces outside the Park, at the neighbouring Kelvingrove Museum, and in the streets in the area.
Some of these may require a short walk/roll to the venue, so depends on your on own needs if suitable or not. 

There is public transport to the area, including train, underground and buses."
1762,Could not have done more for me 
1763,The staff are very friendly and more than happy to help.
1764,"This place is a whisky distillery with a cafe and at first sight presents challenges to a wheelchair user as the cafe is on the first floor. Do not despair! On arrival we were welcomed by genuinely helpful staff who opened doors (all nicely level entrances), accompanied us in the especially installed disabled lift, moved chairs away from table to accommodate us and generally made us feel welcome. The cafe looks out over main part of distillery - the tour itself is not entirely disabled friendly. The food in the cafe is  amazing, the service exceptionally friendly and efficient - in  fact on our visit we met no one who didn’t have a genuine smile on their face. "
1765,Disabled toilet on the entrance floor. Has grab bars in all the right places. Also on the lower floor with the general toilets is another disabled toilet.
1766,"This is a beautiful croft, which is furnished to a very high standard. The downstairs area of the house is fully accessible for anyone with a physical disability. The house over looks the Ochil Hills and is within easy reach of both Glasgow and Stirling. We hired a profile bed for the duration of our stay, this was delivered prior to our arrived and collect on the day of departure, Fiona the owner was more than happy make herself available when the bed was being delivered and collected. The hot tub was fantastic! We stayed twice in 2014 and are hoping to visit again this year."
1767,There is a bus stop right outside the rear entrance 
1768,"The gardens are a real joy to visit at any time of the year.  Access is easy on foot, but there are some fantastic mobility scooters available, which gave my elderly mum a much more enjoyable experience - and we were out for hours.  All they ask for is a donation for maintenance etc.

Access generally to the shop and cafe is on the flat, straight from the car park a few steps away.

Thoroughly recommended."
1769,All on one level. Wheelchair friendly and service dogs are very welcome
1770,"Wheelchair accessible throughout including the kids show 
Allowed with MANUAL wheelchair on the boats"
1771,"There is no parking for the theatre but there is a drop-off space outside where the kerb is lowered. Depending on your mobility, you could also do what we did - got dropped off in Duncombe Place round the corner where there is plenty of space then scooted round."
1772,"Nicely themed , fully accessible crazy golf . Fun for the whole family ."
1773,"Would be 5 stars if there was an automatic door into the building, but wheelchair users have to rely on other concert goers to open quite heavy doors for them. Once inside, foyer and bars can be accessed, with a ramp alongside the internal steps, and there is a lift up to the seating area for wheelchair users & accompanists. The seating area is spacious, offers an excellent view of the orchestra and has very comfortable chairs for accompanists. There is plenty of leg room. You will probably need to queue for the lift, as it is the only one up to this seating area. We were pleased to see two evac chairs on the landing outside the seating area."
1774,There is a blue badge bay about five yards from the door and space to park directly outside the salon on double yellow lines.   The nearest car park is about ten minutes walk/push away so on street parking is the best bet.  There's a bus stop almost opposite in the High Street.
1775,"Excellently accessible with ramps where necessary, wide, smooth concrete paths and boardwalks. Friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. "
1776,"I cannot express how truly grateful we are to a wonderful service and staff team at The Calvert Trust in Exmoor. Two of our service users visited last week and returned with the most wonderful smiles on their faces and this was all down to you! You enable individuals to be able to participate in activities that are considered unachievable due to their disability and for this words cannot express our gratitude. You helped our service users strike things off their bucket list and empower them to feel like anything is possible! Thank you! (Deputy Manager, Livability, Wall Street). "
1777,"The Hytte is a lovely home from home accommodation and fully accessible for people who use wheelchairs. All equipment is available including hoist, shower chair and electric profiling beds.  Sonja and Simon have thought of everything. It is all level access set in lovely grounds with a nice decking area and it is totally private.  It also has a hot tub and sauna!"
1778,There were plenty of transport facilities. 
1779,Very good disabled access everything is on the flat.
1780,There are no dedicated parking bays for disabled visitors.
1781,We found the staff at reception and at breakfast both helpful and polite
1782,"We travelled by private car.  The museum doesn't have its own car park but is directly opposite the main Charlestown car park.  It was a busy day and this car park was full so we had to resort to street parking maybe half a mile up hill from the museum.  The hill was quite steep and because of Covid rules in the town i.e. Keep to the left, some of the downhill trip had to be in the road because the path was too narrow.  There were also a few missing dropped kerbs."
1783,"My favourite local cafe. Good food that caters to a variety of dietary requirements, including vegan and gluten free. Venue is wheelchair accessible, you just need to ask a staff member to put down the ramp to go in and out of the main entrance. Dog friendly."
1784,"Getting to the Taynish car park in a car: at Tayvallich village hall(you go past the Tayvallich village shop, past the church) there is a fork in the road, you take the left side road sign posted 'Taynish' and follow the road. The road to the Taynish car park is quite bumpy! The is one disabled parking spot and approximately 5 other parking spots there too but it isn't a marked car park, so could possibly fit a couple more cars. The car park doesn't get too busy.
There is a path leading all the way to the old Taynish mill(400m from the car park) which my power chair has no issues. There is also a board walk off to the left of the path, not too far from the start; it goes right over a little freshwater loch(Lochan Taynish) and no issues in my wheelchair. If you go back to the main path and carry on, the path starts to wind downwards towards the mill, the slight gradiant downwards caused no issues. There is a grass area right next to the mill, so a lovely spot to have a picnic/lunch. There are a couple of wooden benches(these are relatively new/been replaced) with attached seating and there are spaces where the seating stops specifically  to accommodate a wheelchair. I can go in to the mill to look around in my wheelchair and also across the little bridge to look at the waterfall on the other side of the mill.
From the grass area the path carries on to the shore, no problems in my wheelchair. There is a little stone built seat with a Wordsworth quote carved into the stone seat and a wooden box attached available to write your thoughts/poems/pictures. I can't actually get on to the shore but it's a lovely spot to watch boats and wildlife and have a cuppa (brought my own flask). It would be an issue for someone with mobility issues actually getting on to the shore: there's stone steps with a burn at the bottom leading into the sea. My husband and young daughter have no issues but they don't have mobility problems. But being in a wheelchair I love to watch them even if I can't actually get on to the shore myself.
From 17th May(2019)-30th September(2019) there is an Art Trail leading to and around the Mill, an outdoor art exhibition, so keep your eyes peeled for different pieces of art dotted about! It's a short walk but there is a few (relatively new) wooden seats dotted along the walk, so anyone with mobility issues can have a rest along the way. Hope this review helps! 
"
1785,I found the accessible toilets on the first floor. They were entered via a communal door which was wooden and quite heavy and difficult to open. The accessible toilet cubicle had grab rails and an emergency alarm. It was clean and spacious.
1786,A small step to negotiate
1787,Small! There's a tiny step up to the door but wheels rolled up w ease. A door to push which was ok and helped by other customers. Polite and good service. Great coffee. Tight move to access the toilet. 
1788,Ramped access on East Side (Working St) through Bodlon shop.
1789,"On previous visits to participate in a birdwatching day a course trapping and studying small mammals my needs were considered. On the first a volunteer went with us to make sure I didn't get stuck when we went off the hard path. On the second, the humane traps were placed so that I could access them."
1790,The staff are helpful as they help you to put your shopping away and help you with anything you need.
1791,Access well thought out. Comfortable rooms and extra pillows as needed. 
1792,"This building is wheel chair accessible at both entrances. There are two pools, a plain 25 meter pool with stair entrances or a device to lower those who cannot use the stairs or is wheel chair bound. The other pool has a lift down to the changing rooms and staff always on hand to help out. There is also a large fold down bench in a specific disabled changing room for those who need it. Once in the pool you can most access the whole pool although you would not be able to access the flumes or the Tantrum ride if said person could not walk on their own. Staff are always willing to help and a great day out could be had.  "
1793,"Please note that for any wheelchair user please there are quite a few steep hills and uneven surfaces within Rancho Texas which requires a fair bit of pushing/propelling to get up.   
Once the person pushing has recovered from the hills, there is quite a range of animals to see along with three shows – Parrots, birds of prey and sea lions.  They were all fairly entertaining and well presented in different languages.  As a wheelchair user, I felt that there ought to have been designated viewing areas as it was a bit difficult to see the shows, especially the sea lion one. 
There were a number of animals and birds to be seen throughout the park including White Tigers, Pumas, Bison, Crocodiles, Reptiles and Horses. They all had nice areas to ‘live in’ and viewing of them was made easy due to the layout of the park.  
I believe there is also a splash zone, children’s farm and canoeing which can be visited at an additional cost.
Other than the hills and bits of rough surface, we found the park to be well laid out, with interesting areas ands animals throughout.  We possibly missed out on other bits of Rancho Texas but we found ourselves to have gone round in less than three hours. We thought that there would have been more but not that we found.  Possibly Rancho Texas is more of a destination for families rather than people such as ourselves."
1794,There is a car park behind the museum but there are no marked bays. 
1795,Toilets on train at disabled area
1796,"I arrived by bus which stops about 50 ft from the door, and left by taxi which was able to park right outside. This is not allowed for cars, which would need to park on the street or in the square on the other side of the road. Being a main route there's lots of buses going past which are all accessible, these are the red Lothian Buses. "
1797,"I didn’t use the loo in the main hotel, my partner looked at it and  said it was ‘OK’."
1798,Main Street was full disabled spaces near centre had parking that did not display a blue badge so it was hard for us to park  Not Good .
1799,Very friendly and accommodating
1800,Staff were helpful and friendly with good manners. 
1801,"Great site. Visited several times . Staff great, whole place disabled friendly. Good sized accessible loo in clubhouse. Ramps everywhere making sharing family holiday inclusive for all. Parking alongside caravans. Weymouth too is very disabled friendly with lots to do and places to go. M.v freedom have a converted catamaran which organises boat trips for disabled too. The trips are free though they appreciate a donation as it is charity run. Our grandson who has autism cane with us  and thoroughly enjoyed himself."
1802,"Edinburgh and this venue is fortunate to have the space, locations and facilities to broaden this Market from what it used to be, to what it is now.
The Market theme is located over 4 sites in the City, though we reviewed this one in East Prices Street which is on 3 levels from the lower gardens which straddle the railway lines to the top most level at Princes Street itself. Our entry was near Cockburn Street, Market Street and Bank Street, Access is upon variable ground so chair users must be very carefully - I would strongly recommend having someone with you if you are seated or using any walking aid. Although it’s tarmac there are pot holes, cracks rough patches and uneven ground. There is ongoing work at the Playfair Steps to the East of the Galleries on the Mound so there are staff at each gate who were exceedingly 
 helpful in directions to other areas and pointed out potential difficulty. The Lower Garden level was an area where there were fun rides - 2 carousels - one carousel was lower and had a wide platform that may have been chair friendly. The miniature rail way did not look as if there was an Access area, but the children and adults were certainly enjoying it. There are various food and drinks stalls here too, the next level was mostly retail and accessed alongside the entrance to Continis at the Art Gallery, you need to enter the Gallery here to gain access to the next upper level. Very well sign posted and good directions. There was a wide variation of stalls here from crafts, to seasonal novelties, clothing, lighting, pottery, ceramics, artwork, jewellery and refreshments. Although the areas of tarmac are in better condition here,    temporary flooring has been laid down so there is a about a half inch rise onto the platform you want to visit. The upper level with Princess Street is the busiest level and where the majority of stalls both food and non food are located, there are two large wooden lodge marquees with bars and some seating areas.  There are high rise rides here and various food and drinks stalls give out the Festive aromas and choices at Christmas as you go around and throughout the Market Area."
1803,"The staff are super access is great you can move around the bar area easily and effortlessly.  Didn’t use the toilet, will next time."
1804,Wheelchair access was simple. The doors are heavy but everyone was really helpful. The disabled toilets are not separate but in the women's toilets (I believe the men's would be the same) when I joined the que the girls queing said to me go in the disabled toilets are in there. You go ahead. I was really touched. Easy disabled access special area for seats.  I did have to ring for disabled seating it isn't possible online. Also if you get a free hynt card (if you live in wales) it is valid for 5 years and gets your carer in for free. The card accesses many more venues across wakes so next time I will be prepared. The show was amazing and we did have seating (I had a gap for my chair) that gave us a brilliant view!
1805,A fully accessible toilet is located inside the entrance of the restaurant
1806,Good wheelchair access througout
1807,Reasonable access throughout with good toilets
1808,One entry is wheelchair friendly but not the one at the top of Buchanan Street (behind Donald Dewar statue)
1809,"Parked on the drive which is flat.
Bus goes along the road outside."
1810,In glasgow central station so easy access to trains and easy access from NCP car park attached to station
1811,"Very helpful, gave free entry for disabled person and half price to carer. Offered use of wheelchair, which was very useful as it's a huge space to negotiate."
1812,"It’s a delightful approach towards Two disabled bays right by front entrance, which has automatic doors, and is on the level."
1813,"The majority of buildings appeared to have disabled access with ramped entrance, a wide automatic door and lifts taking you to the top. 
In lecture theatres, all the new buildings had dedicated seating for disabled access; however a few old buildings did not have this accessibility. However, after speaking to disability services it was apparent that they are making changes to this, in order to ensure that all premises have disabled access.
Currently disability services liaise with the individual’s academic department regarding the support required. This often involves working with timetable services to ensure that the facilities being provided for the individual meet their needs. 
If braille is required it can be requested on certain documents. In addition, hearing aid loops are being installed in many teaching rooms. 
"
1814,Plenty of parking both front ant rear of the resteraunt with easy access to a ramp that does not have too much of an incline.
1815,"Queen's Gallery was grand, but palace a little trickier as you get whisked away to a lift somewhere. But very well looked after, people there to help every step of the way"
1816,"The pavements in West Register Street can be blocked by parked cars, but once you get to the entrance, the garden is easily accessible."
1817,"New Street has a steep incline, and the ramp into the Weavers Table might require some muscle power, but the layout of the venue is spacious with easily accessed tables."
1818,Did not see one but feel that there would be
1819,At the venue - didn't need any specific help but everyone we met was pleasant. On the phone - staff member brilliant! I couldn't find access info on website so rang the number they provided & got great info.
1820,"There is no parking in the station area however there are a number of buses that pass by the station on the George Square side of the upper level. 
These are run by a number of companies including First Bus Glasgow."
1821,Nice young man directed me to the toilet.
1822,"A slight ramp to get in, otherwise level access throughout and very spacious.  Many safety features including emergency alarm, emergency lighting, torches etc. See their website for more details. "
1823,"There is a station car park at the side of the station. You also park at Morrison's car park but there is a 2 hour time limit, there are lots of buses as the bus station is next to the train station."
1824,"The car park was next to the station, all depends where your parked you could have a bit of a walk, but there is a wheelchair at the station you could have use of"
1825,There are frequent buses from the town centre.
1826,"Chase Park Festival - a ground breaker in its own right! Well, that's the irony. As a Gold Start rated accessible festival (1 of 4 in the UK) caring for all types irrespective of disabilities - I live with MS - it destroys barriers that can prove to be issues when attending music festivals. And what a festival it is!
I have attended all but 1 (family, tut!) and all have only proven to be an outstanding day of fantastic live music and atmosphere.
I will be going to Saltwell Park to witness another amazing day without worry (MS issues)!"
1827,"We went on the third day of the festival so there was already soft ground and mud. However what wasn't there tracking down?? When we first turned into the car park we got stuck. Luckily there were some staff there to push us out (I think they had been doing that a lot by the look of them!). Then when we got to the dedicated Disabled Parking that was all boggy and muddy too. We managed to unload and get to the disabled camping area where the ""Disabled Check In"" tent was."
1828,"I have never been here before, so thought we would give it a go because it was recommended. I am in a wheelchair so did not know what to expect and when we got to the front door of the restaurant it was clear there was going to be a problem getting in due to a large step. However, one of the staff saw me and very quickly came out and told me that there was alternative access at the back of the restaurant as they had two entrances. The staff went out of their way to ensure we could get in and three of them all were very attentive and ensured i had a suitable table that i could sit under in my wheelchair and fussed over me quite a bit which made me feel very appreciated. Throughout the night the service was first rate as was the food with an excellent menu and choice of foods. I felt very comfortable there and would definitely go back.

I did not use the toilets so cannot comment on these for wheelchair users. 

Overall an excellent place to go."
1829,Lots of staff inside all willing to help and direct you to where you want to go. Even find time for a chat when your waiting for the halls to open.
1830,There is a disabled carpark which is free for Blue Badge holders. There are automatic doors which lead to a lift to access the reception area. 
1831,"Easy to find in main reception area.
Clean, plenty of room to turn. 
Plenty of grab rails in situ. 
Room for a carer. 
Assistance cord in situ ( complete with Euan’s Guide Red cord card!)"
1832,Fully accessible using a lift
1833,Be prepared for some sand! From the car park you scoot past the gate and take the middle track to the sea. There is a sturdy wooden track that has been laid that goes right to a great viewing platform from which you have a fantastic view of the beach. There are a few boards on the way with more info about the area. It's a bit of an all terrain adventure with undulating gradients but 10 mins later the view over the beach is your reward!
1834,Flat entrance but if doors were closed i think you'd require assistance 
1835,The disabled access is very good as the garden centre is all on one level.
1836,I was very hot and felt unwell. I explained I would love a banana milk shake without ice cream. The assistant blended a banana with cold mil. It filled a pint glass and only cost £1.60. She was lovely. So was her colleague who was just as annoyed as I was that there was no ramp up to the loo.
1837,"As the National Respite Centre for people with MS Leuchie House is very important.  Those with MS, and their carers, need respite from time to time.  The staff and volunteers at Leuchie did all they could to ensure that guests had a very good holiday with a variety of entertainment, excellent food, very good physiotherapy and an overall very high standard of care."
1838,"We were on holiday & spent 2 nights at this amazing Lodge. The accessible room is on the ground floor, is large with plenty of room for a wheelchair to move around easily. There is a large wet room with a roll-in shower. There were adequate grab rails at the toilet & there was a seat in the shower. We were able to go to the bar area via a short path from our room to the bar. Breakfast was served in the dining room which was accessible on the ground floor. "
1839,Reasonably  priced Italian restaurant very friendly and helpful staff ......access may be a problem as there is small step at entrance ....see photos ......we managed to bump wheelchair up without too much hassle and staff are eager to help.
1840,Good accessible pub on George Street. I like that you can order on an app and the accessible toilet is always clean.
1841,We had an induction tour upon arrival which covered everything. No signposting but not really necessary. We didn't have a wheelchair user in our party but from when we could see there was wheelchair access everywhere.
1842,Took the Flytoget train from Oslo airport - great system with inbuilt ramps at the wheelchair section and a very helpful conductor who seemed to magically appear at the right moment.  The train arrived at Oslo station which was connected via a shopping centre to the hotel.
1843,I didn't check for grab rails. Room for a carer and easy to find.
1844,"There are only a limited number of wheelchair accessible rooms so I would strongly recommend that you book in advance if you require a adapted room. The room itself is small and compact with 2 single beds, a large bathroom, a TV and four plug sockets which is good for your mobility scooter, powerchair etc. My tip would be to store your wheelchair or mobility scooter in the toilet so you free up more space in your bedroom. Cabins without lifting equipment have an additional drop-down berth available for a carer. On board the ferry, there is a lift that can take you to either lever 3 (Car storage area), Level 5 (Cabins) or level 6 (Shop, bar etc) On deck 6 of the ferry there is both an accessible toilet and shower situated in the midship’s stairwell. There are tables with movable seats to allow wheelchair access in all the restaurants and lounges. "
1845,"I'm not sure where the nearest parking is as City Square is pedestrianised, but the main bus stops are a short walk away. "
1846,"Lotherton Hall is a great place for people of all ages and is very accesible for wheelchairs and mobility scooters. There were numerous wheelchairs and mobility scooters in use on the day i visited. The grounds  are very flat and there are lovely garden areas with children's play equiptment and picnic benches. The bird garden is currently undergoing re furbishment to enhance the facillities for the birds. However, this does not spoil the walk round the bird garden which is very nice. The paths round the bird garden are wheelchair friendly. The restaurant is lovely serving a variety of food and beverages and the courtyard outside is a nice place to sit if the sun is shining. Opposite the courtyard are the toilets one of which is accessible for wheelchairs. A great place to 
go if the weather is good and a reasonable price too!"
1847,We parked underneath the cinema and it was close but more space is needed behind the car.
1848,Disables Parking available very close to the entrance 
1849,Kay suggested us whatever we needed. If you have doubts or problem you can ask her and she will do the best to help you.
1850,Bus stop just outside the station. Parking can be difficult though if travelling by car
1851,Accessible loo available at education centre cafe but not visited.
1852,"4 self-catering holiday cottages (3 cottages x 2 twin/ double bedroom plus lounge double sofa bed - sleeps 6, and 1cottage  x 4 twin/ double bedrooms - sleeps 8) with level access entry, mobility scooter charging area in porch, 'H'-frame ceiling tracker hoists in wet-floor shower room and bedroom(s), Clos-o-Mat toilets in 2 cottages, drop level work surface/ breakfast bar in kitchen, spacious open plan lounge/ kitchen/ dining area, electric profiling bed.

1853,A ramp is provided if they are given notice and will be watching for you to arrive.  
1854,"Access a simple, it is step free and there is an elevator inside. There are two options for people with disabilities, you can be amongst the crowd at the front of the stage on a platform (with the peasants) or you can be in a booth upon the side with a small number of other people. Though I have never been on the platform in front of the stage, there is something magical about being in the booth and I would highly recommend it. To get to the booth a member of staff will take you through a warren of passageways and a up a level in a list but the glory of this is that you pass through backstage."
1855,"The staff were friendly and helped with finding the seating area, using the lifts and generally making the evening a success."
1856,"Really impressed with how easy it was to find my way around Liverpool Lime Street station. Signs were large, clear and with easy to understand pictorial symbols. "
1857,"Over a year on, Bristo Square is still a construction site. So direct access is not really possible. I don't know about any near car parking"
1858,There are disabled access toilets which are clean and well maintained. There is not a CP toilet yet. I would hope this will change in the near future to allow the Botanics to be a fully inclusive and accessible place able to be enjoyed by all. 
1859,"We had a large table of 7 before visiting the nearby Winter Gardens 
Papa's is situated on the Promenade at Blackpool.
The quality, size and price of the fish and chips was excellent.
Wheelchair accessible with a ramp.
Super smiley staff."
1860,I can only talk for a person with a physical impairment using a mobility scooter. Access is perfect - lifts in each shop. The signs for the lifts aren't obvious for newcomers but just ask the approachable staff. Access from shop to shop is also good - smooth ground between each. 
1861,"The main lift was out of order on our visit, but there was the option of another lift or going straight through to the snow factor on ground level."
1862,There is a disabled loo but it doesn't have a sign on the door so you have to hunt for it!
1863,I walk to there and it was easy to get to.
1864,reasonable access throughout the store
1865,"The restaurant is on a cobbled lane (with non-cobbled pavements) which didn't look the easiest to park on, but there is on-street parking in nearby Charlotte Square. A short walk from Princes Street, there are loads of busses that can take you with in easy reach of the restaurant."
1866,"No steps within the airport, lots of lifts to get you up to security.  Once at security there was a dedicated additional needs line which we sailed through.  "
1867,Wonderful historic building. Magna Carta. Beautiful grounds. Delicious cake!
1868,"Getting into the visitor centre was easy with a large automated door. Once inside there was a clear main corridor off which all the facilities and services stemmed. Just inside the entrance you could turn right into the shop, ticket area and on to the paid exhibition. Going straight on you pass the education room, the toilets, the accessible toilet and then on to the large cafe area. All spacious, bright and easy to move around in.

If you then venture outside you can follow the tarmac walkway that takes you gently up toward the battlefield monuments. If you're a manual wheelchair user you may need a hand. It's a fair distance from the visitor centre to the monuments so you need to be pretty mobile. Once at the main monument the level access route takes you up a lengthy and steep ramp to get into the centre of the monument. Worth the effort as once you reach this point you walk through the core of the circular monument and the dominant and dramatic sculpture of Robert the Bruce comes into view. The surfaces around the monuments is varied but you can get up close and feel amongst the 'action'. The views and the atmosphere were fabulous!"
1869,"Disabled parking right at door and accesible
Toilets inside"
1870,Good facilities but not as clean as they might be.
1871,"Bradgate Park is part of the national trust charity and is well known for the free roaming deer and 830 acres that is publically accessible. . The lower area of the park has a tarmac pathway and is easily accessible and suitable for wheelchairs and pushchairs, with scenic views and the River Lin that runs through the lower park that has become a favourite for picnic areas. There are two café one in the Newtown Linford car park and the other in the middle of the park, these are both wheelchair accessed and are purposed built with a hoist in the Newtown Linford disabled toilet and handrails. 

A new off road mobility scooter has been issued to the park called a tramper. This is free of charge however booking is essential which a phone call to the Estate office is. The tramper can be collected from the car park following a completion of the registration and safety instructions that can take 20 minutes. This allows access over other areas that cannot be covered by a standard wheelchair.
"
1872,Amazing
1873,"The car park is level but there is a very steep hill up to the main door, I estimate it to be about a 1 in 4.  Once inside there is a platform lift up to the restaurant.  Access through the restaurant is good, some parts are narrow due to the layout of the seats."
1874,"All one level, bedrooms with wet-rooms, hoist if needed. Jacuzzi bath, kitchen wheelchair friendly, sitting room no sharp places to hurt yourself."
1875,Disabled loo through bar and might be a bit awkward in a chair. Modern loo with mirror and  handrails and quite spacious
1876,Getting to into house ramps. Currently a large lift (as part of roof restoration) to take you to top of roof. Currently access to view house tour is on ground floor as is Chapel. Though wheelchairs not allowed in Chapel staff very helpful in pointing our significant points of interest that can be seen from doorway. Found access to coffee shop narrow with small step okay for wheelchair  but accessibility inside is challenging as a very small area.
1877,"Car park shared with other buildings but disabled parking is closest to the Science Centre building.  A considerable walk from car park to entrance if you are using sticks.
We did not know but we're told by staff that our parking ticket was put through a machine which cancels out the fee. Therefore disabled parking is FREE."
1878,As I described earlier in the review the toilets were the main problem.
1879,"We followed sat nav which was fine.  No steps, a slight lip at the front door which my lightweight power chair was fine with.  It’s a bungalow so no starirs/lifts."
1880,"this location now has a changing places toilet with hoist. 
fully accessible rooms with disabled parking.
very friendly staff"
1881,"I was really looking forward to a day at the typhoons lagoon water park but right from the start it was not an accessible experience.  Sand on paths is nice to look at, but not to move a wheelchair in.  Steps into the lazy river seems fine but not when they're steep.  and the trauma trying to her into and out of the swimming with sharks experience ruined it entirely. Really disappointing."
1882,"Limited Disabled spaces, infrequent public transport"
1883,"Once up in the lift to the passenger deck, there is a disabled toilet close by and friendly staff to direct you there."
1884,"Directly under the Forth Rail-bridge, the honeypot Creative Café is in an  amazing location, and with windows all along one side of the building, it really makes the most of the views!

The Creative Café is for everyone - adults and children ...even pets occasionally! It offers a variety of classes and workshops, group bookings and parties, as well as being open for you to 'drop-in' to any time. 
We tried ceramic painting and glass fusing, other options include soap-making, bath bombs, wood craft etc.

There is also a small café and shop, which you can visit with, or without, doing anything creative."
1885,"Bus, train and car park all close by. "
1886,For a timber cabin like building in the middle of a forest the accessible loo was just fine.
1887,There was an accessible toilet off the concourse which was accessed via a RADAR key. It was easy to get in to but a little tight on turning space once you are in.
1888,"Delicious vegan food, but like all good quality food, not cheap! Very good service, but restaurant not very big, and the bathroom is not accessible. "
1889,Disabled access was good with a nice wide doorway so it was easy to wheel in. The threshold was level so no bumping or bashing to fight my way in. Inside there was plenty of space to have a browse around and check out the shoes.
1890,"Just had a quick peek in the loo, not enough room to take my scooter in, whilst it appears larger than a normal sized loo there wasn't a lot of room for manoeuvering a wheelchair and having an assistant. It was clean and easy to locate, with a grab rail."
1891,Easy access with ramp and electric doors. Lots for sale on shop floor but could still get around on my scooter. Signs for toilets clear.
1892,No disabled toilet. Non disabled gents and ladies loos in visitor centre - you need to get up the three larger steps to reach them.
1893,There is a disabled toilet on the ground floor. It is spacious and has an emergency red card cord.
1894,"Staff were extremely polite and helpful towards me, although when I asked them about the hearing loop they did not know how to use it. Staff kindly provided jugs of water for visitors."
1895,On this occasion I drove there by car. There is a public carpark located behind the shops on the High Street however there are specific disabled parking spaces to allow disabled people to park directly on the High Street despite the street itself being pedestrianised.
1896,You can park right outside each of your designated cottage.
1897,Always friendly and helpful.
1898,There are lots of Disabled parking bays available in the car park. I haven't visited using public transport. 
1899,"This pub is famous for its pies! They are also listed with various organisations as a motorhome stopover. You can stay overnight in their car park and they even have electric hook-ups for £10 per night.

We had a lovely meal delivered to our motorhome and later, our first post-Covid drink in a pub."
1900,There is a step at the front door and tables and chairs inside. There are also wheelchair accessible tables outside on a wide pavement. This is a lovely place to sit on a sunny day.
1901,As you'd expect of a private club of this calibre every effort is made to make the member and their guests comfortable and relaxing. 
1902,It’s a place you need a car for there is spaces
1903,"There are taxi companies in the city that can take wheelchairs, but you will need to call to have one pick you up from the station.

Tran accessibility in Japan is variable. Manual ramps can be used on newer trains and the bullet train, but older rolling stock on lines like the Gono line only has stepped access. 

It is strongly recommended to book a wheelchair space if you are looking to travel by bullet train."
1904,On street parking and plenty of space to park with a Blue Badge
1905,"RADA, also known as the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art is a famous drama school. From their Malet Street entrance there is step free access to RADA Bar, which is open to the public. The bar serves food and drinks (hot, alcoholic and non alcoholic)."
1906,"Very pleasant and helpful staff in beautifully situated hotel with good food.  But why can't architects do their job and provide fully accessible features.  There was no cut out under the washbasin so that I had to reach forward a long way to wash and use a towel on my lap to avoid a soaking, and I couldn't reach the kettle or hanging rail. This was a ground floor accessible room. The only ventilation was a pair of French windows opening onto the lane, not secure, and there was no air conditioning, so very hot at night."
1907,"New Caffe Nero chain in Quartermile, loads of space and various types of seating types and tables, "
1908,"The entrance doors were very heavy and I pushed up the entrance hall mat/rug by opening the second door to get the power chair through. The rug was further ' scrunched up' by the wheelchair catching on the edge. 

Doors narrow and difficult to open. Area in front of lifts very tight as also used to store laundry etc as housekeeping and guests shared the lift.

Although, two lifts were available only one was working for the duration of our stay and another guest (a repeat visiter) mentioned that it had been out of order for some time. This is quite a big hotel and with housekeeping staff also using the lift we had quite a few lengthy waits. In addition, the lift is quite small and we only just got the power chair (an NHS Salsa mid wheel drive) and carer into the lift. I had to take my son up the room and then go back for luggage. Note: he is an excellent driver and he found it very tight. On this occasion I had to take a bigger than normal mobile hoist and it is only thanks to a very kind guest that I was able to get it up to the room (again with multiple trips and me going up the stairs while he had the hoist in the lift and agin leaving my son alone in the room.

The room itself had very little additional space, the carpet made it almost impossible to use the hoist and the beds went all the way to the ground (no clearance for the hoist to go under). If I wasn't so exhausted and stressed by this point I would have left.

We didn't try and get round any other areas of the hotel as it was too stressful.  "
1909,Parking on roads around the park 
1910,We drove and parking was no issue. It is a large car park and there were disabled spaces available.
1911,Westminster Station is nearby and is fully step-free. Several bus routes serve nearby Victoria Street.
1912,All very friendly and welcoming.
1913,"Only had a little interaction with staff (at disabled entrance) but they were very warm and welcoming, despite the fact they were there to bag-check. "
1914,"Wheelchair accessable Dutch Pancake Restaurant.   Very helpful, friendly staff to all  customers.   Will visit again.   Accessable toilets.
Delicious savoury and sweet pancakes. Bagettes, soup, ice cream."
1915,Staff were helpful and friendly
1916,"Provision for disabled guests is poor with only one unsuitable room available in this large, upmarket hotel."
1917,"I checked their website before booking, it was clearly accessible. There are some steps inside the exhibition but there is an alternate route and there is no need for assistance from the (friendly) staff. There were accessible loos but I didn’t use them. "
1918,"There was an accessible toilet in the main foyer. It required a RADAR key to open it. Inside it was spacious and clean. There were grab rails and an emergency cord which reached towards the ground. The lighting levels in the toilet were very low and this is why I marked it down slightly, I needed a moment for my eyes to adjust and this might be a problem for some visually impaired people."
1919,"We decided to spend a day out here.  My son has a wheelchair so it was with relief that I found that the entire place was partially wheelchair friendly. We had a great time. The paths are mostly gravel and difficult but the house and views are worth the trouble. The cafe sells lovely tasty delicious scones- everyone who visits Polesden Lacey must try them. The staff are friendly and willing to make the effort to assist you. If you ask politely, they will even give you a accessible map. The site provides information on accessibility. 
Toilets are clean at least. "
1920,Local museum tells the history of Ile de Re.
1921,"Clare lodge, Newcastle, Co Down is by far the most accessible hotel that I have stayed in by far.

Every single room in this hotel is fully wheelchair accessible and have an ensuite wet room. They will loan you a toilet frame, raised toilet seat, or a shower seat if needed.

All the staff are access NI trained and are very helpful.

The only thing is the meals are set, but they will cater for people with complex dietary requirements if you arrange this when booking.

There is limited disabled parking. There is also a garden and there is also an accessible balcony on the first floor. "
1922,Tarred path all the way to the memorials + room to see them all close up. 
1923,Disabled parking spaces just outside the entrance. Not sure about public transport.
1924,There are accessible toilets in the spa/main reception and restaurant
1925,The staff were  some of the best parts of my day as they went out of their way to help me with everything I needed to do.
1926,The staff were very helpful and friendly. As I was entering the museum there was a gentleman in a wheelchair and the staff were asking if he needed any additional support whilst visiting the museum.
1927,"You can find on-road parking at the top of the park, but it’s worth knowing that there is dedicated disabled parking at the bottom end, off Ecclesall Road (opposite the entrance to Berkeley Precinct). If none is available there, you can drive into the park itself, where there are 2 or 3 disabled spaces on the left. "
1928,"The staff were friendly
"
1929,"Great info of surrounding areas from vast geological times to 'recent'  time ie lighthouses,  to crofters and army. Cafe was lovely and staff all very helpful and friendly . Disabled parking bays right outside door, and even though doors were easy to navigate through, the staff immediately came to offer help opening door to let us in. Plenty of room for the chair with a lift to the next floor. Only tiny spot on the visit was the light in the toilet was on a timer and was very short and meant a little bit of fumbling in the dark for it to come back on. Not a issue really and something that I'm sure they can fix ( I admit I forgot to say anything so it shows how little it affected our visit ) At time of written it was.""suggested"" that you booked a 10 minute slot but we got in unbooked as it was quiet. All in all a great visit ."
1930,Very friendly. We book to ensure a table. They seem to have good awareness about customer service/communication. 
1931,Although we walked there are ample disabled car parking spaces close to the entrance. The bus stop is just outside and travels in both directions.
1932,"We stayed here for 7 weeks while an extension was being done to our home to meet the needs of our disabled son.  Lynne and Jasper were very accommodating, including moving one of the beds to the garage so that a care bed could be delivered.  We brought our own mobile hoist.   Access into and around the house was good and we enjoyed the use of their lovely warm pool with ceiling hoist."
1933,This is a fabulous arrangement of lodges on a great site. The lodge was for 6 people and there was more than ample room. Everything you would need was there for use with a particularly well equipped kitchen. The bedrooms are roomy and the accessible shower room is a fantastic size and great layout. In the visitor's book there were some suggestions for changes all of which made sense but there was nothing about the lodge that hampered our fantastic stay there. It is very accessible. We would definitely use it again - fantastic!
1934,Often when you go exploring older places you don't expect much by way of accessibility. Southwark shows what can be done both on an environmental level and in the warm welcome offered.
1935,Helpful lady at the refreshment kiosk helped hubby carry drinks for myself and elderly folk with us.
1936,"The minibus was quite high up but I was given a step to stand on so I could get in and out comfortably. On the tour we stopped at several places/ view points. The driver was very considerate and stopped where it was flat, helped me in and out and would drive  the minibus as near to where we were going as possible."
1937,Grand Central in Birmingham is a shopping and eating complex connected to Birmingham New Street Train Station. It has connections to the rest of the city centre and to the Bullring (i.e. the main shopping centre). 
1938,We travelled by car so not sure about public transport 
1939,"This place caught our eye when we saw signs to it on our way to Malin Head (Ireland's most northerly point), and we were glad we went to have a look. ""Famine Village"" sounds a bit grim - and trust me, as a British visitor you will hear some stuff about your Victorian ancestors that does not make you proud - but it's as much a museum of Irish rural life in better times as a place that tells the story of a tragedy. A major bonus was the tour given by a man who had actually lived in one of the traditional houses there as a child in the 1970s and early 1980s, and he told us all about local customs, food and drink - even offering round samples of poteen, the potent Irish moonshine. As far as access goes, it was a bit tight at the entrance/shop area, but I was easily able to get into everywhere else on the site on my small scooter. There were wheelchair-accessible loos in the village site and the snack bar across the car park that were both a bit tatty but big and clean, and a highlight of the visit was that my scooter coped OK with the path across the beautiful sand dunes near the museum.   "
1940,Good.
1941,"Modern, very clean (well it would be terrible if it wasn't based on the theme of the museum!!). In fact the cleaning cupboard was in the accessible toilet but there was still a decent amount of room. The emergency cord is now the proud owner of a Euan's Cord Card as it took a lot of work to untie. Four toilet roles to choose from!"
1942,"Two Temple Place is a 2 minutes' walk away from Temple Tube Station. However the  station is not steps free. There are 28 steps from the platform to the ticket hall.  Once outside if you turn left there is another flight of 10 stairs, the house then on your right,  almost immediately in front of you on the opposite side of the road. Alternatively turn right on exiting the tube station and then turn left onto Embankment either going through the gardens, if they are open, or following the pavement until you come to the first road junction, turn left and the house is in front of you.  There are also a number of buses that go along Fleet Street and the Strand but this would involve a walk down quite a steep hill, or you could use the lift at Somerset House, when open, and exit on Embankment and then turn left and a 4 - 5 minute walk to the house."
1943,Drive in and register your vehicle at the reception. 
1944,Staff that we saw were smiling. We didn't need any particular help.
1945,"Although a porta cabin style building the accessible toilet was fantastic. So much space you could have held a party! Easy to get to, on the level, wide dooorway, and grab rails."
1946,Fully accessible changing area.
1947,"Nearest car park is about a quarter of a mile away at least, although it does have plenty of disabled parking bays.
It's not a street for road vehicles, so the nearest bus stop is maybe 100 m away."
1948,"Very pleased to find a clean, reasonably spacious accessible loo on Cromer Pier, and someone before me had even put a Euan's Guide card on the emergency cord!"
1949,Polite and helpful.
1950,"Again, the fact that Whelan's can get really busy means that the bar staff will be on their toes with serving drinks so if you're looking for the key for the bathroom, you could be waiting a while. However, they are very friendly and if you ask the bouncers, they will look after you."
1951,There was an accessible toilet by the other toilets. Fairly large but not big enough to transfer from the right hand side.
1952,Coastguards on site.
1953,The Sky Garden is about a 15 minute (max) push from London Bridge Station which is completely wheelchair accessible. There is no disabled parking in the location.
1954,Staff are most helpful around the whole centre especially helpful bringing a scooter or wheelchair etc to customers cars and picking them up when you are finished your visit.
1955,"Ripley Castle is situated in the heart of Ripley Village, it is accessible by car or public transport (number 36 bus running between Leeds and Ripon) and situated approximately 4 miles from Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

In addition to the castle the visitor amenities in the village include a small general shop, tearooms, a pub and restaurant, the Church, a large car park on the outskirts of the village, a small art gallery and two gift shops all within a very pleasant and scenic setting.  The village is level and has a mixture of tarmac and cobblestoned roads and pavements.   

Disabled parking spaces (x 3) can be found adjoining the tearooms (opposite the castle entrance) or next to the castle wall a few metres from the entrance (x 3).  The terrain between these spaces and the entrance is level and either tarmac from the tearooms or cobbles from the castle wall – this section of parking also has access via a single lane, quiet road that runs adjacent to the cobbles.

The castle is accessible through the gift shop which has a level, hard surface floor and suitable door widths for wheelchair access.  The merchandise is set out to allow wide aisles between displays and the path through the shop to the castle entrance is not obstructed.  The entrance to the castle is at the back of the shop where there is a disabled toilet with suitable circulation for a wheelchair user.

A four-wheeled motorised scooter is available to reserve (recommended pre-booking) although motorised scooters are not allowed in the castle building, electric wheelchairs are permitted in the castle with prior advice.  A manual wheelchair is available for use during the castle tour.

The surface from the entrance to the castle and terrace is compacted gravel and although a hard surface would be easier this is manageable for wheelchair use.  The gardens are largely accessible with a variety of hard surface paths, signposted, permanent ramps between the terrace and the gardens and double gates with a level threshold between the general grounds and the walled gardens.  The deer park and lake walk is not advised for wheelchair users as the terrain is general parkland/grass fields, undulating and with stone steps leading back up to the terrace. There is no wheelchair access into the hothouses although wheelchair users are able to pass through the hothouse entrance to access the wooded areas of the grounds.

The main entrance to the castle is ramped and fully accessible to wheelchair users, the tour consists of six rooms of which four are on the ground floor.  There is no lift so visitors with limited mobility can watch a DVD that shows the tour information for the upstairs.   Hearing loops are available and can be requested in advance, and visitors with visual impairment are encouraged to handle objects throughout the tour.

The staff are all professional, helpful and welcoming.
"
1956,Not helpful
1957,"We will say this, Scottish people seem to be naturally friendly, will people, and we received all the support we needed. Staff everywhere are just the same, so we offer high marks for our Scottish friends."
1958,"Wide aisles, and easy to get round."
1959,Good staff.
1960,Bit of a bump to get in the front door but doable. Once you are in the bar itself is not built for people in wheelchairs.
1961,"Had an amazing time with my partner and kiddies tonite at ur accessible families evening.  The lifeguards and water ambassadors went out of their way to interact with the children and their families, playing in the water with them, joining in with rides etc. 
The poolside, changing rooms, showers, etc were very clean. 
How fantastic for our children to grow up in such an inclusive environment.  
We will certainly be returning again!!! "
1962,"As mentioned very spacious with full changing table and hoist for an adult user .
"
1963,"The staff were really helpful and lovely both when booking tickets, in the village and showing us to our seats.  They made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.  They definitely added to the experience."
1964,"Due to The Enchanted Forest taking place within a nature walk you’d expect the pathways to be a little uneven and tree roots I’d have to drive over, but mostly all the pathways were resurfaced. Last year I needed support on my chest to get off the bridge at The Enchanted Forest s it was a couple of inches higher than the pathway. This year though I was really surprised that the pathway had been raised and there was now no bump to get on and off the bridge.

I felt this year that the slope leading up to where the main food area is and the toilets, was a little bit more uneven this year. I couldn’t really see very in the dark and felt like I was falling to the side a little, but with help from the people I was with I managed to get up and down safely. I also understand that the ground does get worse over time, especially in a woodland area, however if it is able to be resurfaced I would definitely recommend the organisers look into it.

Some areas last year had bark laid down which never works well with the wheels of my powerchair, however this year was a little different. The storytelling hut had an accessible entrance around the back that the  bark had been cleared away from, meaning you could enter without getting stuck. There were volunteers to tell us about this different entrance, however I would suggest a sign to point visitors in that direction just incase a volunteer is busy with other visitors when people pass the hut. I didn’t go into the storytelling hut, so I can’t comment on the accessibility inside, but from the outside I did notice a threshold at the door which my powerchair and other wheelchairs could struggle with.

There was a really nice fire pit this year that I wanted to get a photo of, but it was in a barked area. I tried it as my friend said it felt like a thin layer, however I got stuck and had to ask other visitors to help pull my powerchair out. Maybe putting mats down over the bark would help if you’re not able to uplift the bark. There was an interactive light area which also had bark on the ground, I didn’t know there was a tarmacked path at the other side of the trees. The volunteer didn’t know this either and again there was no sign, however the pathway stopped before you got near the interactive lights. This meant I still had to go on to the barked area to get to the lights, which again I got stuck on. Mats on top of the bark would be great here too.

The viewing platform was great for wheelchairs as there was a lower down bar section so visitors sitting would be able to see. There was an interactive area where visitors were able to place their hand on a piece of wood and you heard a fact relating to the light show theme, however this wasn’t at a good height for wheelchairs, it’s good for children though. Where you roasted your marshmallows this year on the fire, I felt it wasn’t very welcoming or spacious for wheelchairs. It had a fence around it, which is maybe for health and safety, but a wheelchair may struggle to get around."
1965,good food and pleasant staff meant a relaxing lunch
1966,There is no parking attached to the hotel but a Pay & Display multi story car park is at the rear of the hotel. We travelled to Newcastle by train and walked & rolled for 10 - 15 minutes to the hotel. Internally a permanent ramp takes wheelchair users to reception with 2 lifts then to the bedrooms. I believe that no bedrooms at all are on the same level as reception.
1967,Accessible loo available on the same floor as Music Hall.
1968,"Large car-park with number of disabled parking spaces that has a ramp providing great wheelchair access.

Rather out-of-way so little if any public transport nearby."
1969,"We booked this hotel as its right opposite the Liverpool Echo arena . My husband can only walk 500 metres and this hotel was easily accessible for him. In the rooms their is a small fully fitted kitchen ., with dishwasher, fridge , cooker microwave ect.
Tea towels, washing up liquid ect are provided . We cooked our own dinner in the room to save money and it worked out well. 
The hotel do a 'happy hour ' between 6.30 and 7.30 pm where they offer free drinks and snacks .
There is a M and S food hall 15 mins walk away in Liverpool city centre .
The easiest entrance for the Arena is through reception and over the plaza . No steps from the hotel to the arena ."
1970,Staff did very well to help get a specific room that would accommodate my needs and were available for any more assistance
1971,quite a lot of blue badge parking but can be quite  a way from the shop as the centre is pedestrianised.
1972,This accessible country park has a few different walking routes that you can take and beautiful scenery to enjoy.
1973,Access to the store is fine but once inside there’s split level on the ground floor and stairs only to 1st floor
1974,"All staff were extremely helpful and willing to make the necessary adjustments to accommodate individual needs.
They were all very pleasant and welcoming and very knowledgeable about their Scottish artefact history."
1975,Very helpfull and attentive - they were alsoproficient and very fast
1976,This is based on the current takeaway service which does not require you to enter the cafe. You order your food and drink from one window and collect it from the other. The windows are open from approximately 3 feet off the ground so easy to reach your items and pay. Their food is on display in the window so easy to see what is on offer. 
1977,Getting up on to the Royal Mile was easy as there are loads of buses passing along the nearby bridges. Further up the street then went across the George IV bridge. All the lothian buses are wheelchair accessible.  The railways station was a ten minute walk away.
1978,"Easy to get to down the wide aisle.
Big toilet with lots of handles.
The waitress followed me down and opened the door for me although it wasnt necessary to. She was there again to hold it open when I exited too. Very thoughtful."
1979,The one staff member that assisted me to get in to the toilet was helpful. and pleasant
1980,"On arrival, a member of staff went out of his to a) point out access b) get as map of the venue c) get a  free wheelchair d) point out suitable cafe (of the two). He was extremely helpful and pleasant.
The exhibits were well laid out an easily accessible."
1981,I can't actually remember but I tend to remember when they're bad so it must have been pretty good.
1982,Staff were so helpful and created space for me and my assistance dog by pushing tables together   Made us feel so welcome 
1983,There are disabled parking spaces in nearby streets but it is on the Dalry Rd and you can't park outside but can drop off.
1984,"Generally a good experience. The lifts are unreliable, the toilets leave a LOT to be desired. If you ring to book in advance for a yourself and a free carer's ticket, the phone staff demand that you bring along proof of disability when you turn up to collect the tickets. This practice is insulting and demeaning and should be stopped."
1985,Good toilets all around the site but no changing places. Some bigger than others so transfer easier in some than others. All clean though 🙂
1986,"Well signposted from A55 and A5.  Designated area for blue badge parking - 4 bays,  near the entrance which has a good surface and is fairly flat.  Not sure about public transport."
1987,"Flat with good paths. Also tennis courts, skate park, outdoor gym, large areas of grass and benches to rest on."
1988,"Smelled a bit. Poeple were also using them who didn't need to and the were a bit dirty, on the plus side the did have nice music."
1989,"Disabled parking is limited. The bays available are just basic bays, they do not have marked out sections. The bay is just slightly wider, says disabled and in white paint. "
1990,"Very friendly, not many just walking about ."
1991,"There are several dotted all round the ground (some need a RADAR key) but all are large, clean and fully accessible."
1992,All areas are accessible although if you're in the downstairs bar you have to go outside and up a relatively steep ramp to access the bathroom in the main pub.
1993,"The automatic front doors are wide which is ideal for wheelchair users, also the entrance is a flat surface.
The aisles are wide, giving space for people to pass by with ease. The store is well lit - easy to see items on shelf, the store is also kept clean and free of clutter. However, some items were high up of selves which may require help to reach."
1994,"It's a great museum, but it can be hard sometimes to get everywhere and certainly when you are on your own. I actually got stuck somewhere on the top floor in the museum, because the doors were to heavy to handle by myself. There wasn't any staff available that moment over there, but I had the luck that there came another museum visitor, who helped me with the doors.
Disabled toilet which I used was too small, badly accessible and didn't have a bin.
The food in the restaurant was lovely and the staff was very helpfull over there."
1995,"The staff could not have been any more helpful. They cleared an area for us to use comfortably, explained where the closest toilets were and also made recommendations on what to order. Couldn't ask for any more."
1996,"The loos work ok for our daughter even though they are not special disabled loos in the church itself ~ only in the parish centre and the youth venue, the Storehouse."
1997,Morgan and Menna are always really helpful but the wooden boards the owner has provided to cover both steps are totally unsuitable and may actually be dangerous.
1998,"It's very difficult to get inside this pub in a wheelchair and almost impossible in a powerchair because of the big and complex step on the threshold, and there's no accessible toilet. Drink! be merry! and hold your bladder!"
1999,"Very, very interesting museum about the transportation of Jews from all over Belgium and Northern France, through this Kazerne, to the extermination camps during WWII.  It dealt with the perceptions of the Jews up until transportation, and the collusion of the Belgian officials.  
First the is a film about racism and genocide around the world.  It focuses on antisemitism, but also includes genocides in Rwanda, Belgian Congo, Namibia etc.  It shows how it begins with bullying of anyone who is ""different"".  Excellent film
The first floor (""Mass"" - the run up to the holocaust.  Pre-WWII) deals with the way in which the feelings of the ""masses"" in Europe were swayed against Jews by propaganda and antisemitic messages, the split in Germany between the Communists and Nazis after the WWI defeat, and the huge influx of Jews escaping from Germany and the Soviet Union. 
The second floor (""Fear"") dealt with the discrimination against Jews in Germany and Belgium, and the way in which the Belgian officials often went way beyond what was expected of them by their Nazi overlords in the identification and rounding up of Jews.  Brussels was the only exception.  Jews would be kept at the Kazerne until there were enough for a full transport to the extermination camps.
The third floor (""Death"") was the most chilling.  It still makes me emotional writing this nearly a year after.  The central aisle had on the right side pictures of the deported concentration camp victims contrasting hugely with the happy concentration camp leaders, 'doctors' and admin staff on the left, enjoying the sun, holidays, life ...  Always in your eyes as you moved towards it, in the centre was a railroad - ending at a concentration camps entrance.
Throughout, there was an overwhelming mass of information, witness statements (written and spoken), mementos of survivors - and those who perished.  
Everything is translated into English
A very emotional and informative visit, that we would very, very highly recommend"
2000,"An accessible country park visitor attraction with various species of deer, birds of prey and other animals.  It's a good family day out with guided tours, keeper talks and rides for kids."
2001,"The disabled access as mentioned above is good and the location is accessible to everyone. There is a ramp as you enter the building and a flat surface running throughout the building. There are stairs in the building, however these only lead to male and female toilets, however there is a disabled toilet on the ground floor, therefore this makes it easier and more accessible to everyone."
2002,Ground floor Hall and Kitchens are the main attractions so that is good news. The bad news is the rest of the building is inaccessible for wheelchairs and scooters.
2003,"Access in and around the building:

Finding the building was fairly easy as there are some prominent plant pots outside the entrance. The small metallic ramp was also a bit of a clue for me. Going in the entrance there was a lobby followed by some double doors leading to reception.

After a warm welcome I waited in reception with my companion. The armchairs, table and general surroundings created curiosity. Exploring further there was a private dining room area which was like a step back in time with a beautiful table, chairs and surroundings.

Next was the lounge with large picture windows looking out on to the patio area. The curiosities in the room were fascinating and you felt free to pick things up and explore. 

Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:

Moving from the dining room the bedrooms, not the accessible one that my friend was exploring, but the ones on the upper floor were bright, spacious and well lit. The bedrooms use traditional door keys so there’s no fumbling with cards and trying to get them the right way up.

Access in the dining area:

The main dining room came as a surprise as it was large and brightly lit. The tables and chairs easy to negotiate."
2004,"There is a small car park with limited space but this venue is on a main bus route, though some way from the city centre.  It is probably best to arrive (as we did) on foot."
2005,"All on one street level, ramp to the right of 'the cross'."
2006,"There is a bell outside for wheelchair access and a small, shallow ramp to get in. Inside there is a lot of space to get around the tables."
2007,"Wide ramps and doorways, level access everywhere, plenty of room to operate hoists etc make it very easy for wheelchair users to get around. The dual level kitchen facilities are also a brilliant idea."
2008,Can't fault them! Excellent
2009,There is a small one inch lip at the entrance.  Level surfaces once inside the premises.  It is a small cosy cafe therefore space is limited. 
2010,"Parking areas were available at both places, but must buy a parking ticket for two pounds (2021) Various spots to park by the bridge for lower pond."
2011,"Not quite right - toilet pan central in reasonably wide room, but not enough room on either side for easy transfers!"
2012,"Disabled access is excellent once you get to the main building. a ramp into the house and a lift is available which is well supervised by staff. i didnt have to wait to join my friend on the next floor. the staff were very quick to ask did i need help and took me to the lift.
Because when i arrived there was an issue regarding me having an electric wheelchair, i didnt realise that they had an audio tour until i saw people with the head phones. The paintings etc so not have information with them. the rooms are large and easy to get around and i was able to access every area that my able bodied friend could."
2013,"The rating would be five stars but for the difficulties I encountered with the box office. The building itself is accessible and the standard of the music making is outstanding. Because of this and the limited number of wheelchair spaces, you need to book well in advance (I.e. months, not weeks). It is not possible to book wheelchair places on-line or by email but the telephone booking line offers the option of speaking with someone who speaks English. I had an exchange of emails with the box office and emailed them a PDF of documents (with translation into German) proving that wife is a wheelchair user. They said that these were acceptable but when I phoned to book tickets I was told that they were not & that we would have to pay full price."
2014,"Level access inside, doors are almost always manned which means I do not have to worry about struggling with doors. There is a low counter section which means staff always see me and can help when I need it. There are comfy seats or classic dining tables and chairs."
2015,"Step free access, space to move around within the space, and staff willing to help."
2016,"Excellent tour around the studios, with the tour guide sharing snippets of history and experiences, and there are tour included a trip into Radio Scotland studio as it was broadcasting live and the visit to the set for the news is broadcast."
2017,"Staff in shops very polite and friendly, as were the center staff."
2018,"Had to ask where it was 
 Spacious 
 There was a red cord alarm"
2019,"Friendly and helpful both at Amsterdam Centraal Station, on the train and in Paris The stewardess on the train took the trouble to point out the alarm button in the accessible loo, and when no ramp appeared at the Gare du Nord, she phoned through to summon one. The ramp operator was very apologetic about the delay."
2020,"The Post Office is accessible throughout. Outer door entrance of 1170mm, which are always open when the PO is open, and inner automatic sliding doors 1030mm. Doorbell by the entrance. Slight incline up to entrance. Wide spaces and corridors inside. Standard counter top 1020mm high. Parcel machines are 930mm high. Indoor posting boxes 1260mm and outdoor posting boxes 1260mm high."
2021,"Made fatal error by going to main entrance as have own electric chair. Paid entrance fee and was denied access through open gate (education only) told to go through shop. What they should have said was GO TO WEST GATE as this access is dangerous and Not suitable for your chair. After fall out with hubby skidding down paths and ready to kill each other we found two nice men at west gate who said WE CAN HELP
and got us an electric scooter much more suited to the path conditions.  NORMALLY you need to pre book these so ring ahead.  Yes these two lovely gentleman redeemed fountain abbey without their help we were going home. To the manager the staff at reception need some training in how to approach customers with mobility issues and I strongly recommend it coming from the very kind gentleman at the gate.  Cafe used in the abbey but having been told at reception the dogs were able to go in as they had recently changed their practice when tried were directed to the no dog sign so sat outside in the cold."
2022,"The staff are lovely, they clearly know their job. They are extremely helpful when asked for assistance, most of them will try to make your experience in the centre or pool as stress free as possible."
2023,We drove but all the disabled parking spaces were taken  - it surprises me that there are so many disabled folk using the facilities so early in the day (10:00 a.m.)
2024,on all three floors
2025,Quick visit during COVID-19. This store is next to a McDonalds and ALDI (which I’ve also reviewed). There is good parking which is why I like to come here.
2026,"Although a private car park close to entrance, it has too steep an approach to hotel entrance, and to many steps throughout the hotel. We did not find a lift. "
2027,"From the point of reception to the restaurants to the animal enclosures and back again, all staff encountered were amazing, polite, pleasant and nothing was too much trouble..  "
2028,We didn’t use it but the hotel has spacious courtyard parking with level access straight from the car park to the foyer. There’s a bus stop just outside the main entrance and the train station is about 10 minutes wheel/walk away.
2029,large car park (not busy on a weekday out of season) with couple of disabled spaces and readily accessible disabled toilet in car park.
2030,"The only staff I met were the ticket scanners, who were remarkably cheerful considering they were standing out in the rain for much of the week. We seemed to find the one dry morning. Maybe that is why they were so cheery."
2031,the access was superb
2032,"A very happy shopping experience for a wheelchair user, and a good accessible toilet which has a few things badly wrong with it."
2033,"The staff vary from (occasionally) very friendly to (generally) disgustingly rude & insulting. The staff on Platform 15 are exceptionally rude and unhelpful, and often astonishingly ignorant about the correct and safe way to deploy a wheelchair ramp. 

Staff can be very elusive - many times I have got stuck on a train waiting for someone to turn up with a ramp to let me off. They either don't get the message that has been transmitted, or they ignore it. This is very frustrating and annoying.

I dread using this station, because of the attitude of the staff."
2034,"Members of staff are extremely helpful - nothing is too much trouble. Staff have had training in a basic level of BSL, with further training planned in the future.  Staff receive training to enable them to cater for special dietary requirements. Some staff have additional support needs so they understand the problems people can face when going out. "
2035,"Very accessible. While there are some slopes and cobbles which could be an issue for some, there is a  mobility vehicle that will take you up from the esplanade to the main viewing area and cafe, which avoids the majority of it. Manual wheelchairs may require some assistance in a few places."
2036,Quite a tight car park to get around in a fairly big mobility car but the disabled bays were right at the entrance and roomy.
2037,"We used the accessible loos in the Arsenal and in the the new building. Both were clean, reasonably spacious, equipped with grab rails both side of the loo and wheelchair accessible washbasin. Both had single alarm cords at the side of the loo stretching to within 18"" of the floor. In both loos it would be possible to side transfer onto the loo from either side. Someone had turned off the light in the loo in the Arsenal and I had to use my phone as a torch to find the switch. It's on the left, just inside the door."
2038,is on a pedestrianised street no parking outside but is close to numerous bus stops and also few minutes from Buchanan Street underground.
2039,The EICC was a fantastic experience because  from the front door through to the auditorium I was offered help and assistance.
2040,"Entered gardens on flat level surfaces,  and it was easy enough to get into old pub as on the level, even if a little narrow by bar entrance, but it’s level tiled flooring."
2041,toilet was large and clean you do not need a radar key
2042,"There is an automatic door to let you into hotels foyer, and it’s level all the way, with lifts when needed."
2043,"Accessible toilets are available at various points throughout the castle. One is located at the main entrance and was spotlessly clean, tidy and modern. Another is in the Education block just off the castle square and others are available. Staff are happy to show you where the toilets are and even took me to them, helped with the doors, and suggested the best routes to get around."
2044,Looking for somewhere that little bit different we stumbled across the Scottish Story Telling Centre's Cafe. At first you don't know where to enter but inspecting the signs on the building wall there's an accessible route signposted.
2045,On a very steep road. Are spaces outside if you can get them 
2046,"ONE toilet with baby change in it, staff wanting to change the bin before me going in after having waiting 20 minutes for 4 families to change their children's nappies and toilet paper being on the cystern at the back which meant twisting round to get it meant that I wouldn't give higher.  The toilet in the priority lounge didn't have an emergency cord which would have meant no help had I fallen, but at least this loo was cleaner tidier, not a baby change and a much shorter queue!!"
2047,"Parking is of no problem, and although only two disabled bays, there is ample parking spaces. Coming along an inviting driveway you arrive right outside the entrance for the pub."
2048,I got some takeaway vegan cinnamon buns from here. Would highly recommend it. Staff were really friendly and we all agreed the buns were very tasty. 
2049,Reasonably frequent Lothian Bus 8 goes pass. 
2050,I would like to give them 4.5 stars. The hotel is very well organized and has been especially decorated for wheelchair access.
2051,"The nearest step-free station is Tottenham Court Road, which is just a few blocks away, and several bus routes will drop you near Cambridge Circus, which is a few hundred metres away. Beware: Tottenham Court Road Station is fully step-free to train only for the Northern Line. For the Central Line, it's step-free to the platform but not to the train - shame on TfL for this omission."
2052,Really good! As we approached the entrance gates I wondered if there would be steps - but nope it was step free. The paths were tarmaced and kept clean and without obstructions. There were bridges to cross over to the other parts of the park and although they were sloped they were all step free. There are benches and places to sit throughout the park. Plus there is no skating or cycling which makes the experience even better as you're not having to look over your shoulder the whole time.
2053,Excellent accessibility to all properties. An unusual and welcome feature is the garden with raised beds which is accessible to all guests.
2054,Curry's PC World in Falkirk's central retail park is a large appliance store with really good disabled access. Shopping was a breeze!
2055,There is an information desk located on the ground floor where staff are helpful in answering any queries or providing assistance.
2056,"Only 1 accessible loo that is also used by the theatre in the same complex.
The loo really does need upgrading as quite shabby and not a lot of room especially if a carer is needed."
2057,"all signposted, lifts, disabled accessing doors, staff assistance, dog friendly"
2058,Very helpful and very friendly
2059,"Lots of accessible parking in shopping centre, 5 min walk from Balally luas stop and Dundrum luas stop"
2060,All staff friendly and helpful but never intrusive or patronising.
2061,Cafe itself is difficult to access as there are too many chairs and not enough space to get round easily.
2062,"Michael Hoppen Gallery is a small fine art photography gallery, in Chelsea, just off King's Road. Disabled access was very poor."
2063,"Plenty of room for dad in the loo, hand rails etc"
2064,Disabled bays
2065,"Ok grab rails. Through two very heavy doors, hard on carers back.  A bit grubby. Carer and wheelchair just fitted. Powerchair might be a tight fit."
2066,"The building is mainly easily accessible, however requires use of a (single) lift"
2067,"Everything was on one level. NO steps, slopes, ramps to contend with. "
2068,"No signage, but resort map  provided. Flat access everywhere on the site. Lifts to the room, smooth limestone floors everywhere. Wheelchair accessible rooms in hotel.with plenty of room, beds with legs for hoist access, shower seat, grab rails and raised loo in bathroom. No access to room's balcony. Access not guaranteed in apartments. Ramps and absence of steps meant the whole site was accessible except for the beach terrace and Dead Sea access. The spa offered flotation in Dead Sea waters as an alternative. The spa was partially accessible and pools on the site had ladder and step access but no pool hoist available. Dining room  had part accessibility, with other restaurants and bar all with full access. Staff were incredibly helpful."
2069,"As I do not require this facility I didn’t check, but I’m informed by the ground they have an accessible toilet "
2070,The doors are double width. There is automatic doors in the main entrance. There is not level access into the venue.
2071,Spontaneously decided to visit for Evensong as part of their Disabled Access Day programme. So pleased we did! Staff were fantastic. Set up was amazing. Very cool circular lift that whisks you into the main part of the Cathedral. Evensong itself pretty amazing - great to see the pomp and ceremony of such an historical building up close!
2072,Accesses step free and there is a lift indoors to take you to all  floors. I might add that the lift is incredibly busy so give yourself plenty time.
2073,"Staff very helpful, holding doors, etc."
2074,The only staff I experienced were the instructor and the staff in the slope. They were all really friendly and easy to talk to. As I mentioned the instructor started off using terms I didn’t understand but I asked for clarification and she then explained things really well throughout the experience. The staff all seemed happy and like they enjoyed their work which was lovely. The instructor was very good at skiing and I felt confident going down the slope with her. 
2075,Seven Stories is a fab museum - I loved it!! There is so much to do and lots of exciting exhibitions to see. The only reason I've given it four stars is because parking is fairly difficult and there isn't great public transport links.
2076,"The Green Room is a bistro restaurant on Upper Gorund right behind the National Theatre. It is in a modern building with no steps or even slopes from the street to the tables, which contain props from National Theatre productions."
2077,"What a wonderful thing to do. The Ping Pong Parlour is provided free of charge for those who shopping in Nailsea Crown Glass Plaza. It is generally accessible with level entrance and door width 870mm to 1700mm. It is up to you if you want to play ping pong - I did with my daughter, it was the first time I'd played ping pong since I've been in a wheelchair and I had a lot of fun (see photos!). Thank you Nailsea Crown Glass Plaza! There is no bell/knocker, no hearing induction loop, no braille support and no seating available. Its open 9-5 and ""Table tennis with friends"" meets every Tuesday and Thursday 2-4pm."
2078,There were a lot of steps and the main entrance had a lot of large bumps I couldn't get over in my wheelchair unassisted. The step into every entrance door was large and they had no ramps they could get for me
2079,"A local theatre and community venue that often puts on politically apt and challenging performances. The Albany also helps support local young people to get experience in theatre, as well as hosting events like community gardening and a cafe."
2080,"I did get a friendly welcome from the staff in the onsite café, staff were very helpful. When shopping around the store I felt as though the staff were on hand if I needed their assistance. Although not directly approached, the staff wore a uniform, which made it easy for me to identify them from others so I was able to ask for help. "
2081,Surprisingly good access to be found along the riverside walkway and across the Millennium Bridge
2082,"The centre has wheelchair friendly ramps, lifts and automatic doors, as well as braille readers and large print guides.
There is free use of both manual and powered wheelchairs offered for the period of your duration at the shopping centre. Mobility scooters are also available. This equipment does not have to be booked in advance. 
"
2083,"Access around the Park is good with clearly defined tarmac paths, fairly level, and good surfaces for wheelchair access."
2084,I only encountered one disabled toilet but it was very large and had all the expected rails et cetera. I have attached a photo
2085,"Fantastic venue with wheelchair access to ""almost"" all areas."
2086,The best way to access the museum is by car as the station is about 20 mins walk which will be uphill on the way back.  Valley road that runs under valley bridge is the best place to park as it is a long road with free parking for disable badge holders within about 25 metres. There is then a wide and level path up to the museum. 
2087,Numerous - Easy to find - big enough but could be larger.
2088,The hotel had a large accessible toilet next to the gym.
2089,The path is  a lovely walk the only thing is that the gravel part of the path has some bad hidden cambers which veer towards the beach. I would recommend taking assistance for this part of the path.
2090,"a Gravel drive from the road to the 'Lodge', with hard and level paving to designated disabled parking bay"
2091,"Disabled toilets in Viking Centre very clean with plenty of room, it is shared with a baby changing facility."
2092,The best disabled loo is on the top floor to the left of the lift exit. There was just enough room for my carer and me and my powerchair. It was clean and tidy the first time I used it but the second time I used it the toilet needed a good clean before it was usable. The disabled loo in the main entrance to the museum is too small for a powerchair. I mistakenly went in and found that I was completely trapped until I gingerly reversed back out!
2093,A very busy part of London so parking may be challenging.  You can contact the museum to make parking arrangements if you are a disabled visitor.
2094,Friendly and welcoming.
2095,"Access was impressive for its age. There is a modern ticket office, shop and cafe on shore. Once you have your tickets you go on board via a long boarding ramp and the gradient will vary according to the tide. At the end of the gangway there's a platform lift that staff operate to take you down to the main deck. You can get around two of the main decks and I mnaged to get around easily with my powerchair. There are a couple of narrow doorways but these are probably wide enough for everything other than the wide chair e.gl more than 70 cm."
2096,"The site is very open and there are Ramos everywhere. There is also a lift to the viewing platform albeit with a huge queue. The other lifts to the upper floor are elderly and disabled only, so no queueing, just ask someone nearby to let you in. The biggest issue we have is the need to rest occasionally, and this was difficult."
2097,"From the creative mind of the architect Piet Bloom, experience unique houses that were designed to look like a modern forest.  Constructed in 1977, this site contains 38 regular sized cube houses and two larger cube houses.  Each home is tilted 45 degrees on a hexagon shaped column that serves as the home entry point and staircase.  Though entry into the museum cube  is not wheelchair accessible, the unique neighborhood has a wheelchair accessible ramp so you can enjoy the home exteriors as well as a couple interesting shops and a small chess museum."
2098,"This Airbnb is in a good location, right next to Roundhay Park. It is a double bedroom with your own lounge, bathroom and outside patio, but small step to get in and the bathroom isn't accessible. 

"
2099,On street parking is available and Blue Badge holders can park outside the front door. A bus stop nearby has frequent accessible buses into town.
2100,"I boarded the boat at Nyhavn. It was easy to get to. Copenhagen has great accessible public transport and buses and metro have wheelchair access.  Nearest metro stop is Kongens Nytorv which has lift access, is 3 -4 minutes walk away. There are also a number of bus routes that stop close by."
2101,The staff were helpful and friendly.
2102,The staff were very helpful in anything we needed
2103,Easy. Bars to assist needed on some
2104,Staff went over and above to help. 
2105,Good number of spaces in the Eldon Square Shopping Centre multi-storey car park with lift access for car park to Eldon Square Shopping Centre and then a short distance to the restaurant which is clearly signposted or can be found by asking staff.
2106,"Easily accessible entrance with automatic doors. Once in, access very good with wide aisles"
2107,"The staff were excellent. I only looked at their website just before I left to check the address and when I did I noticed that they stated that although their events are on a first come first served basis, pre-bookable seats were available for people who couldn't queue. As I hadn't pre-booked I went expecting to stand in the queue. When I arrived the queue was already quite long. However a member of staff was handing out stickers to people who joined the queue. On seeing me standing with my crutch she immediately asked if I would like to have a seat rather than queue up.  I explained that I hadn't pre-booked and she went inside to arrange this for me. She returned about 3 - 5 minutes later and took me inside. I was met by another member of staff who took me through to a seating area to wait until the room was ready and who also showed me where the toilets were. When the room was ready I was escorted through to the room and was able to chose a seat before the people in the queue were admitted. "
2108,Level entry with working door buttons. Some aisles a little narrow and one not accessible.
2109,All the staff were very attentive and smiley 
2110,"There was a wooden ramp from the parking bay up to the private patio area. The patio had table and chairs, gas BBQ, patio heater and small outdoor fridge, but there was still space to easily move around in my wheelchair.

Access from the patio into the tent was level and step-free. Once inside I was shocked by how spacious it was. There was lots of space to manoeuvre around and it felt bigger than a lot of hotels I've stayed in. It also felt nice to drive across the smooth wooden floors. 

The king-size bed was comfortable and was nicely decorated with cushions, blanket and hot water bottles. The bed was lower than a standard bed, so it made wheelchair transfers fairly easy. Space underneath the bed could accommodate a portable hoist if needed.

As there was no electricity in the tent, there were times we struggled especially in the bathroom at night. The small solar light on the roof didn't give off much light so we were almost in complete darkness. This made using the bathroom even with assistance very difficult and a little risky especially as I can't walk, have extremely poor upper body strength and rely on help with everything. I feel the low-key lighting is perhaps not so good for guests with mobility and visual impairments.

There are so many pros to there being no electricity. One being you get to switch off and have no distractions from the internet world, friends etc. However, this could be a problem for disabled guests who require mobility aids/medical equipment and also need to charge them. I have a powerchair so I'd need to charge it if I was there any longer than a day. Thankfully I live very close and fully charged my chair the night before our stay. "
2111,We asked where the roundhouse was and they said you don't want to drag a wheelchair all across the car park. I couldn't! They suggested I drove over to it as it is on the exit route.  This area was shingle free.
2112,"This is for the bedroom toilet as I didn’t use the restaurant toilet. The door to get in the toilet is a pull door which was a bit awkward, it also slowly closes when you open it. The toilet was very nice and clean, a good amount of space however not enough that the wheelchair would not get wet if left in the room when using the shower. There was a red cord and that hung down to the floor, the toilet was at a good height and transfer is from your right side. There was not a grab rail at this side though which could make transferring difficult- I tend to transfer from the front and swivel but this was not possible. The sink and mirror are at a good height and I could sit in my chair and do my makeup. The shower looked amazing, there was a fold down seat but no grab rails next to it which could be problematic if you are unsteady on your feet and also difficult for transfering. There was a rail on the side wall under the shower (a foot or two away from the seat) I don’t recall there being another one though"
2113,"There are three, of which we experienced two, one of which was in the restaurant (see separate review). The attendant at the ticket desk in the museum was very helpful and fetched the key for us from the porter's office. The loo was spacious & clean with sensible grab rails and alarm button which could be reached from the floor."
2114,Queen Street is easily accessible from either Queen Street station or Central station near the city centre. Parking could be slightly more tricky because of the city centre location.
2115,Plenty of disabled toilets. 
2116,This pub has no ramp to give entry to wheelchair users and no accessible toilet.
2117,It's easy to get into the shop and easy to get around. There is a lift to all floors. Signage to the accessible toilet is confusing because it sends you to the stairwell!
2118,Buses are frequent and go into Glasgow and surrounding areas. Parking for disabled is abundant in the multistory car park and outside 
2119,It's a ruined cathedral designed long before wheelchairs but most of the ground floor is accessible. Covid safe with mirrors around dark corners and santiser available. Have to book in advance but we did that with the QR code outside the gate. 
2120, The staff were friendly .
2121,"The accessibility really hadn't been thought through properly at all! Although there is step-free access into the building, the door is not power-assisted and is extremely heavy - I was lucky that my partner was with me and was able to open it for me because I definitely would not have been able to open it on my own. The next thing to note is that all the signs are extremely high up and in fluorescent pink/red lighting with no braille translation - which could cause issues for those with visual impairments or those susceptible to migraines, seizures and/or sensory impairments (e.g. autism). While the lift is close to the entrance of the building, once called, the door has to be manually pulled open (not great, for someone who is hypermobile) and again is extremely (and unnecessarily) heavy to the point that if I was on my own, I would not have been able to enter through the main door or the lift due to the extreme weight of the doors (and there is no explanation of what to do in this scenario, for example, although I am deaf, there is no call button by the lift, like there usually is for hearing customers). I am also a manual wheelchair user (which is quite small) and I don't know how well a mobility scooter or powerchair would fit in the lift - especially as the door to get out of the lift is different to the door entered and would require turning around in a small lift. To go up/down, the lift buttons also have to be held down! Once out of the lift, the floor is then carpeted (another design flaw), which is very difficult to wheel on and the signage is not at all clear for how to get to the screenings from leaving the lift - so if going I would advise going to the bar, which is near the lift. No additional seating was notably visible in the hallways. In each screening, only one wheelchair space is available - however, there are seats and sofas which are possible to transfer to and there are hearing assist capabilities. "
2122,I used the ordinary toilets but the accessible toilet was next to it.
2123,A very nice bar that serves great food and friendly staff and very helpful.My wife is in a wheelchair and they will always move chairs or tables about to make space for her.
2124,Current plans in place to make more accessible for wheelchair users
2125,Great facilities very spacious just difficult to initially get into the doors are quite heavy and would require some assistance.
2126,"Big, with all the drop down rails you needed.
No changing table but lots of too . I’m not great at transferring and I managed ok.
Normal height loo."
2127,A really fabulous inclusive park. Fully wheelchair accessible and great equipment for my son to play on. Really friendly staff. Will definitely be going back!
2128,"Lots of them, knowledgable and happy to help explain displays."
2129,"We didn't use the toilets but I did look at them, accessible toilets are in the main hall where tickets are picked up."
2130,We drove around side streets and were lucky to find a disabled space near the ground.
2131,Friendly and helpful.
2132,"I love this place but in terms of accessibility it could do a lot better. Firstly they do not offer free PA tickets although they will discount two tickets down to the lowest price. Secondly there are a lot of steps as it is an old building and although there is a lift this gets busy so longs waits can occur. On the ground floor there is seating near the lift which helps. The other thing I find frustrating is that in an effort to be more accessible they labeled all their accessible toilets gender neutral and because of there situation everyone uses them again meaning long waits. There are also a lot of clutter in them in the form of extra bins. There is a lowered section to the main bar but not the cloakroom refreshment area. There are two performance spaces both have areas which can accept wheelchairs but these must be booked in advance. Level access to the lower seats in the round can be arranged through back stage. 
On the whole the staff are extremely helpful. "
2133,You can park in marked bays just outside hotel........you can take the train from Edinburgh to Tweedbank and get a bus into Melrose (infrequent service )
2134,"There was a lift down to the cafe and loo, clearly signposted. There was a commentary for people who are visually impaired. Space to manoeuvre or for a carer but not both. Clean and tidy."
2135,"Ramp to front door, wide entrance, plenty of circulation space."
2136,"Easy to get into the shop, a lift to all floors, an accessible toilet (with one dodgy feature - see below), and friendly staff."
2137,Friendly staff to guide you to where you need to be
2138,All staff are friendly and helpful - nothing is too much trouble.  The staff all talk to my daughter and though she is PEG fed they always ask if they can get her anything to eat /drink: no assumptions are made. Also opening doors for us on arrival and departure is much appreciated and makes things easier.
2139,"Some parking bays outside though on a busy weekend I'm sure they will be constantly full.  There are two public car parks just along the road, both have a good number of disabled bays."
2140,Very good.
2141,"I honestly can't think of anything they won't have thought of or not be open improving. If you've any worries or questions, ring the club and ask for Dave Messenger. This gent is a gem and nobody could be a better Supporter Liason Officer for the club. He loves Watford FC and that passion rubs off on others. He'll point you in the right direction and will go out of his way to make psure you have the best day imaginable!"
2142,Spacious offroad type parking.
2143,"Buckingham Palace is accessible in either a manual or power wheelchair. They have managed to make the rooms open to the public as accessible as possible and the staff are thoughtful and knowledgeable, I have visited three times, twice by car and if you telephone in advance you can park inside the Palace grounds. I have also wheeled up from Victoria station or you can take a short taxi ride. The price for a disabled visitor is reduced to £13 and you can take a carer for free. At the end of your visit you can convert your ticket into an annual pass (open from around 22mnd July to 1st October)."
2144,Accessible toilet was adequate and clean. Access is level but slightly awkward and difficult to see since faces away from the pitch on the middle of the access ramp. It may be smaller than comfortable for carer assistance but I would defer to carers for comment.
2145,"A great big castle at the top of the town. Great views for miles around. Lots of rooms and displays to see, including costumed staff. Audio guide available in multiple languages. All outdoor space is cobbled so be careful. Limited parking but a bus train available from town centre but not suitable for wheelchairs 🙁. Ice cream van and cafe 😁. "
2146,"Good signs, impossible to get lost."
2147,"The hotel is in the centre of town so ideal for transport, right above the trainstation and a 5 minute walk from the bus station. There isn’t a car park but we were able to stop at the right side of the building by going down a different street. "
2148,"The first individual I asked for help finding the disabled toilet did not speak English! The second person said something along the lines of ""No sir we do not have a disabled toilet"" 

He then proceeded to direct me to the one over the other side of the shopping centre. I was totally gobsmacked!"
2149,Disabled parking 300 yards from entrance.
2150,"All of the staff were kind & helpful and made sure that all of my needs were met without any problems at all.
The show's security guys took me to the lift, (which was big enough for my large wheelchair and my son) and met us downstairs, where they made sure we were seated comfortably in our designated area."
2151,No parking and on road parking is a nightmare. Very close to a bus stop.
2152,"This is a lovely cafe, beautiful cats and very peaceful atmosphere. Very nice drink and cakes. They do all they can to make sure the cats are happy and comfortable - but unfortunately this takes priority over everything else and this can cause some issues for vulnerable customers. 

Lighting level is quite low, and there are lots of items around that could cause issues for people who with visual issues. Again I can understand why this is good for the cats, but it’s not good for us.  

It’s all on one level and you can get to most of it using a wheelchair (Part of it is up a step). The gates to stop cats escaping are quite hard to negotiate, some staff will help you (others just turn away and sort coffee cups out but other customers helped us) 

Be prepared to move furniture/cat equipment to get around in a wheelchair.  I have no idea if you are meant to - no one has ever offered to help or challenged us so I guess it’s ok :) 

Accessible toilet is ok - one of the standard ones for people who can transfer. But we couldn’t get in there as turning circle to get to door was full of cat contraptions.  There is a changing places loo in the Arndale two minutes away fortunately. 

Some of the staff are really kind and helpful, others not so much.  We don’t expect the entire world to revolve around us - but there are a few small things they could do to make it more accessible. It’s a shame as it’s such a beautiful idea and it could be a fabulous therapeutic place to chill. "
2153,"Me, my husband, our son, his lady and their dog.  The museum was all on one level and all areas were comfortably wide enough for the mobility scooter. An interesting  visit."
2154,"Fantastically friendly, knowledgeable and helpful."
2155,"There are only two 2 toilets in the store one male one female these are located next to the checkout area on the left hand side as you go in. 
Both toilet doors open out the way you can get a wheelchair in however there is a plastic guard on the back of the door that block the area it does move but is a bit of a issue both getting in and out of the toilet. There was also a lot of goods being displayed next to this area in metal baskets that were in the way."
2156,"Amazing! Kind, supportive, understanding, and fun :)"
2157,Most of the residents in Schagen speak English and are willing to answer your questions.
2158,"Great toilet, all new and shiny."
2159,"All the staff we encountered were friendly enough, and tried to help us, possibly FAWSLEY Hall hotel needed to be more friendly, but in general all was well."
2160,Access to the Creative Exchange is good and you enter through the glass doors in Constitution Street. Once in the main body of the building the space is open plan and there's plenty of room to get around. It's brightly lit and well laid out.
2161,Kerry farm as a unique team of people that are truly accommodating champ fun to be around robin is very good with his advice ali friendly very helpful great with the children helps arange your days out makes your time stress free ! Chris brilliant always ready to help Tina incredible lady who makes your time truly amazing shes the best worker there The Children can warm to her shes lovely  Natalie is a amazing person her hard work shows in the farm she works so hard making sure every person whos stays gets  the true kerry farm experience she is the heart of the farm a wonderful person to meet
2162,This was my first time visiting Glasgow airport as a wheelchair user. It was a very mixed experience with the assistance point being really helpful and friendly along with the staff who took me through security and to the plane. Less good was the changing place toilet was very dirty and unfortunately my wheelchair was broken by the crew in Glasgow who loaded it onto the plane. When my flight couldn’t land and was returned to Glasgow it took the help desk several hours after everyone else on the flight got a hotel room to be able to find an accessible room for me to stay in (though to be fair this is also part of a larger system issue than specifically the airport). A real mixture of good and low points. 
2163,"Fantastic temporary build to enjoy gin and whiskey tasting experiences, accessible for wheelchair users."
2164,Mimi's are a well liked cafe chain in Edinburgh. This one benefits from really good access and a central location. 
2165,"Great if you're in the harry potter areas, otherwise dream on"
2166,Great level access from the car park to the front door.  Only problem I could see is that due to the quirky inside there are several different floor coverings to contend with.  One minute it's wood then next carpet.
2167,"Close to both Queen Street and Glasgow Central train stations, Buchanan Street is easy to find."
2168,"Being in the city centre parking is not available directly outside the venue but there are many car parks in the city.  The Metro in only 3-5 minutes away by wheelchair, scooter or foot - Monument is the station to use, although scooters are not allowed in the station unless folded up and pulled along. Lots of buses stop outside on Pilgrim street and the surrounding streets such as Blacket street, too many to list."
2169,"There are 2,spaces outside the main entrance in the car park. For fit people as access is by steps...
Alternatively go to the left on entering and head towards the wooden building, plenty of spaces
But those spaces are small and on a slope with you having to parallel means you either have the door slipping from you hand or hard work opening it"
2170,"Well marked disabled parking, close to the terminal entrance. Bus station within sight of the terminal. Taxi rank close by."
2171,"The Millennium Gallery always has a good selection of exhibitions and events, as well as a nice cafe and shop. It is all wheelchair accessible. There is a disabled toilet and both entrances to the buildings have level and ramped access."
2172,"At least two sets of really good accessible toilets. 

One star lost because someone had 'tidied' the red emergency cord away onto a shelf area a metre and a half above the ground. This is so silly: the cord should hang all the way down to the ground so that it can be pulled by anyone who falls over, for example during the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet."
2173,"The Museum has a separate car park for Blue Badge Holders which is closer to the Museum than the none-badge holder car park.  
We did not have a Blue Badge but there is a 'drop off' point right outside the main entrance where it was safe to disembark our car and not have to rush.  There is also a bus stop right outside the main entrance."
2174,Parking ride outside the door.
2175,"All ground floor, plenty of space in cottage & good access to garden"
2176,"There is some parking on the road outside the pub. The pavements are uneven but you can park close to the entrance.
Bus stops are close by but there are no tram stops."
2177,Fantastic historical ship - surprisingly accessible - lots of thought has gone in to making it an inclusive place to visit.
2178,everywhere was wheelchair accessible on our visit the only problem was it was a bath with overhead shower which is ok for some ambulant disabled but not for all their is both a lift and hearing loop in the reception 
2179,"a lot of disabled spaces, no public buses goes  to the museum but you  can get a bus to Partick bus station and walk across "
2180,There are disabled parking spaces available in the Findhorn Foundation Car park but it is quite a trek from there to where this event was held up forestry tracks.  Findhorn Bay Arts did get permission for us to take our car nearer to the location but there was still a fairly bumpy forestry track to negotiate slowly.  There are buses and trains to Forres from Inverness and a local bus goes  past Findhorn Foundation.
2181,"There is a carpark 300 years away, This is pay and display (even for blue badge holders) but it is flat, no gravel, and there are plenty of accessible spaces. 

There is a hill to negotiate between the attraction and the carpark. You can be dropped off at the gates of the jail, and a pre-bookable shuttle is available between the carpark and the attraction. "
2182,Very helpful and welcoming. 
2183,"You need to go in through the garden at the back of the pub. You would need a companion to open the closed gate for you. Once inside the beer garden there is a permanent ramp into the pub. However, you have to manoeuvre around the tree and there is not a whole load of space so you would struggle if your chair is larger than standard power chair size"
2184,"Personally, I wouldn't advise disabled people visiting here on their own - as it isn't easy to get in due to the narrowness of the entrance and the food, on conveyor belts isn't the easiest to access.  But the food in buffet form (decently priced) is good."
2185,Staff were quietly helpful and did not make an issue of it.
2186,The only way to get on the boat is to descend a flight of about 8 steps which have hand rails either side. From the landing stage you then have to get onto the boat. This involves a step up and then 3 or 4 steps into the boat. There is a handrail only on the left hand side. Then there was a step up to the seat and a further step to navigate if you sat at the rear.
2187,"The nearest bus stops are very close, and drivers will probably put down a disabled ramp for you. Parking is either on the street to the side or a very unkempt car park to the side with deep potholes and generally uneven ground which would be terrible for a wheelchair or walker."
2188,Large disabled toilets in the main concourse.
2189,"There's a fairly large car park near to the front door. Several bays are dedicated for use by disabled people. If arriving by bus there are bus stops within 200m of the entrance. I did find when arriving, by bus, that the accessible route to the entrance was not clear. A signpost would help. You head off to the left as you face the building and you'll find an opening with a sloped path up to the doors."
2190,They were a good size with grab rails
2191,"Not completely accessible but we made this work for us and it was completely worth it! Such a beautiful location - amongst nature, incredibly peaceful and a real treat. We will definitely return at some point in the future. A number of accommodations on site with 'Paille et Terre' being the nearest to what could be described as accessible."
2192,The staff were very friendly and helpful
2193,The staff were helpful and friendly.
2194,"On the whole we found access very good,  Restaurants and shops made an effort to ensure that thee=re was space for wheelchairs, moving things out of the way were needed."
2195,Easy to find. Well equipped though no alarm cord. No room to turn a wheelchair due to fixed baby changing unit. Functional and clean.
2196,"No steps to enter, nice wide doors, reception area and disabled toilets near entry. Plenty of toilets on all floors."
2197,"Drop down on pavements surrounding the theatre excellent.
Main door was quite heavy to open , my companion had to open it for me.
Main reception , bar and  main auditorium accessible.
5 wheelchair spaces are available in main theatre .. 
There is an upstairs balcony area,  in the theatre which unfortunately does not have a lift.
Induction loop in place, no alternative formats available.
Signage good"
2198,"About 20 steps to reception.  Benches on route, but staff are waiting to help and carry items if need be.  Designated host..   Flat surface from car park to reception.  Low desktop check in."
2199,"There are other shop on the site, not just the Garden centre, park further out and you pass them en route to the main building.  We went in a couple and I don’t think I have ever seen isles so big.  The layout was very wheelchair friendly with an easy surface to wheel on and wide automatic doors at the entrances.  Turns out this wheelchair friendly theme extended intro the garden centre with both easy wheeling and wide aisles.  "
2200,Don't have large changing facilities
2201,They were more than helpful and attentive. 
2202,It apparently has an accessible toilet but this was not tested.
2203,There are accessible toilets throughout the gallery.
2204,Disabled toilet a little bit down a corridor from the entrance.
2205,"The SOC at Waterston House (see photo) is part of Scotland’s bird club. It is wheelchair accessible and has disabled toilet.There is a gift shop, a  small library and a  seating area (see photo). There is a spacious art gallery with fantastic view of the surrounding countryside. 

"
2206,All the staff I spoke to were friendly and had a good knowledge of all amenities and their whereabouts at the racecourse. 
2207,"There is a drop off layby at the front of the hotel with double yellow lines so not abused by non-blue badge holders as a general parking bay. There is a drop kerb directly in front of the entrance and ramp access to one side. The hotel has its own car park but the daily charge of £20 is, in my opinion, excessive, even if in keeping with local commercial car parks. Brighton has excellent free 24hr Blue Badge parking and there are bays immediately around the corner at the top of Cannon Place. See http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/parking-and-travel/parking/disabled-parking"
2208,"Able to get into hotel reception, and main rooms on level.
There are steps to have to get onto terrace areas, and steps to be able to function room. Main hotel accessible toilet on level, good size so you can spin around, pull cord and grab rails."
2209,From a public transport perspective and as a wheelchair user travelling with a visually impaired person transport was good. Assistance on and off trains was seamless with help on hand at arrival and departure. An accessible bus service stopped in the station's car park and the service offered a circular route around the town. There were loads of black cab style taxis and many had wheelchair access. Drop of points and short term parking were available in the car park.
2210,"Plenty of parking with blue badge spaces close to the ticket office
No public transport. "
2211,"All welcoming and ready to help. In particular, Robert the ground manager showed me it all in detail in advance."
2212,There are accessible toilets located on every floor and all are clearly sign posted. 
2213,"The Museum has two entrances. The main entrance involves stairs which takes you to Level 0 and there is a step free entrance at the rear of the red villa, with automatic doors which takes you to Level 2. The museum is on 4 floors. There is a platform lift between levels O and 1, which requires a museum of staff to operate it. Then a regular lift between Levels 1, 2 and 3.

After going through the PMR (People with mobility restrictions) park entrance the Matisse Museum entrance was on the right, see photo. The main entrance to the museum is down a flight of 20 - 25 stairs with handrails on one or both sides, see photo. Sorry I didn't count them but I was concentrating getting down them without falling. At the top of the stairs is the sign for the Matisse Museum and in small print is a wheelchair user sign and text in French, English and Italian saying that disabled access is limited to the back of the red villa. From the top of the stairs the red villa is visible, see photo.  There are some further signs, see photos. When you are facing the red villa follow the signs to the left to the back of the villa, where you will find a step free entrance with a small permanent ramp in front, see photo.

When I visited I went down the stairs and exited by the step free entrance. I don't know how easy it would be to gain admission through the step free entrance with automatic doors, as it has to be unlocked for me to exit and when I exited In could see no bell to ring if you required admission. Also while I was there I only saw one room steward on the 2nd floor, which is where the accessible entrance/exit is, who was covering the entire floor so I don't know how easy it would be to make yourself known if you wanted admission via the accessible entrance. 

Going back to my visit. I entered via the stairs at Level 0 which is the main entrance. There were was a manual door at level 0, which I found quite hard to open. Immediately entering there is security and then a couple of steps down, without a handrail, to the gallery floor. There was a ticket desk at standing height. 

Once I got to the ticket desk the rest of my visit was step free. There was a platform lift, which needed to be unlocked by a member of staff before I could use it. The member of staff then had to walk up to Level 1 to unlock the door to enable me to exit the lift. While this enabled me to avoid the stairs up to Level 1, I personally did not like this, as I could not independently travel between floors. There was a regular lift between Levels 1 and 3 which is self operated and quite large. 

On each floor there is limited seating, both chaise lounge and sofa style, see photo. I sat on one of the sofas and assumed that as it was leather it would be quite firm. I immediately sank into the cushion and I was unable to stand up unaided (thank you to the kind gentleman who assisted me).  I saw one hard chair, which I think was for the room steward, which I also used. The lack of seating was a significant problem for me. It meant that I had to reduce the amount of time I spent at the museum as I was finding it difficult to stand for such long periods of time. 

There were some video/ film footage to watch but this did not have any sound on. "
2214,Car. No carpark but public carpark next door on steep hill.
2215,"All staff very helpful and supportive. Staff at entrance for guidance. As mentioned the army were brought in to support the vaccination programme, and were exceptionally, friendly and professional"
2216,"Staff at Scarborough SeaLife were friendly and very co-operative considering it was a very busy day. There are a lot of creatures to see and lots of other events, talks and activities going on round the sanctuary."
2217,"The loo is in walking distance for all seating areas, with no steps or uneven flooring it is suitable for any user. "
2218,"Flat tarmac parking with a good amount of disabled parking bays. The museum is also accessible by public transport. This is from their website:
The Museum is accesible via rail and public transport: -
Visitors are advised to access mainline routes to Yeovil Pen Mill, Yeovil Junction or Castle Cary stations. A round trip from Yeovil Pen Mill station by taxi should cost around £35 - £40.
We recommend that you book your return taxi in advance on the day of your visit, as the lead time for local taxis in the afternoon can vary greatly and could contribute to a lengthy delay."
2219,Staff were friendly and helpful. We had conversations about several aspects of access and the team were flexible and helpful in creating the best experience for guests
2220,Staff were helpful in showing us where to go and when checking out items at the till.
2221,Parking no issue.
2222,All the museums had excellent facilities for people with a wide range of impairments 
2223,"All the loos equipped the same and uniform size for wheelchairs and Carers, "
2224,Very helpful and courteous 
2225,Fabulous and attentive - just don't depend on them for directions to other venues!
2226,Street level access and a ramp once inside to access the till. 
2227,"We had such a wonderful weekend away at Petasfield, the opportunity they provide to people like me and many others who have various access requirements is wonderful! My girlfriend was genuinely amazed with the place as she never thought that we'd be able to stay away in a cottage like that because you don't usually associate them with being accessible!"
2228,"An oasis of colourful calm amid the usual bustle of a Tyrolean town.  The mountains make a beautiful backdrop to these lovely gardens.  Even if you're not into horticulture (as indeed I am not), you can't fail to appreciate the shrubs, lakes, nature terraces or indeed the central cafe."
2229,Lots and lots and lots of both able and disabled toilets and they were colour coded so you could spot them from a distance and they were all over so no dashing or waiting and stewards on hand to help  
2230,"Not all disabled people want to have to do their shopping from at the door, some like to browse! 
Shops need to have much more awareness of how much space you need to get about with a wheelchair as most of them are virtually inaccessible due to the amount of stock they have out on the shop floor and the lack of space between the display units. Disabled parking in multi-storey largely reserved for shopmobility, that which isn't reserved is very expensive."
2231,"Automatic door finally working but still.have to go to fire exit door, press button and wait for someone to.open door so.that you can get up ramp. If you are in chair you have to sit at back with no seats for anyone to.sit next to you. Could be better "
2232,A few disabled bays close to the door.
2233,Spacious.   Able to park right at barge or car park at Bridge Inn.
2234,"There is no official parking, it is directly across from Dundee bus station and in the centre of town so easy to access by bus or train. There’s a little lane next to it that’s perfect for being dropped off by car. "
2235,"Really good throughout. Level access, friendly staff and good signage plus a large lift. It's not too big either, so you don't get too tired wandering around. Might be nice to have more interactive exhibits and a greater variety in the way interpretation is presented. "
2236,"Broadwood Farm is a nice family venue with great access for everyone, but the food quality lets the restaurant down."
2237,"Getting around in a wheelchair was easy enough, there are a few areas where you may need the help of a carer to get up the slopes. Some areas are a bit tight for space. The lift was out of order which meant retracing our steps, but that was okay, just wish we'd been told before we got to it!"
2238,I've gone a few times. The staff are always amazing trying to accommodate as much as possible. Finding a place to sit with a wheelchair or getting through is definitely a tad tight but staff generally do try to help get you sat down.
2239,"Old theatres are a challenge in terms of access. The theatre allocates an Access Host to assist. There are steps into the venue from pavement to lobby, then from lobby to dress circle - two wheelchair lifts give access in theory. Regrettably, they've seen better days and the former was broken when I first tried to book then amazingly on the day I visited!"
2240,Never had a issues with the staff
2241,Clean and easily accessed. There was a wheelchair ramp or 3 steps from the area I was seated in (GE03) to the toilets.
2242,"The staff in the visitor centre were simply amazingly with their knowledge and enthusiasm for sharing the Tomatin story. The seamless way we were guided without having the worry about steps and stairs was a great experience and left us able to enjoy our visit to the full just like everyone else.

Unfortunately the stars only go to five but these folks deserve five stars plus!"
2243,Can tell you that there is a loo on baird but didn't use it so don't know how good or bad it is.
2244,"A great little coffee shop and bistro in a lovely Cheshire village. Staff are amazing, welcoming and helpful. Good food and a good atmosphere. "
2245,A range of award winning cottages from farm buildings.
2246,"The attendant at the loos I described earlier was friendly, without being over the top & incredibly efficient & seemed to be keen to offer a good service. "
2247,Minimal interaction at the hotel! but pleasant and efficient.
2248,really easy if you drive
2249,"Flat surfaces everywhere, good paths"
2250,Step free access from street and lifts inside. Some toilets which were accessible weren't signposted as such (such as one on third floor).
2251,Access from rear of venue.  Door was held open but would benefit from having a doorbell incase the door isn't open or any assistance is required.  Unfortunately I was put into a back area and felt a little excluded and that I was putting the staff out a bit.  It was quite early in the morning and they had not long opened.  I was there as part of Disabled Access Day and the lady who saw me initially didn't seem to know anything about why I was there.
2252,"Lovely staff, helpful and friendly."
2253,Wish they had tall seats that went over the toilets 
2254,When they state accessible they really mean it here! We had no problems at all. The equipment we had asked for was all ready there. There was scones and jam waiting. The location is excellent. We walked down to the town centre twice. Lovely comfortable beds and a good wet room. Will definitely recommend them.
2255,"The staff will often do anything to assist, we had issues with our meals and notified the staff and they dealt with the issue swiftly.

We were also offered excellent seating that have us plenty of space for transferring from wheelchair to a comfy seat at the table,"
2256,"A bit hard to find at the top of the castle, through the side door to the cafe. At the visitor point they are easily accessed beside the red phone boxes. Well appointed inside. "
2257,"Disabled parking is part of the OceanTerminal shopping centre where Britaninia is located. There is some distance, around 200 m, between the parking and Britannia. It is all on the level if you park on the same level in the multi story car park."
2258,Staff are generally friendly and helpful and will offer assistance when needed.
2259,The sailing school provide free parking at the harbour although there is no specified disabled space  
2260,"Good access to veranda, toilets and shop. Bit too cramped in indoor café for a wheelchair. Poor access to plant sales area."
2261,"Both the Kerith Centre & K2 have disabled toilets, with the Kerith Centre having changing facilities - not sure about K2"
2262,Helpful.
2263,Only a few disabled parking spots but there are some outside the museum and space is tight in Oxford. They have done what they can. The museum is accessible.
2264,"My husband is in a wheelchair and we came here especially because  it promoted  accessibility  in the NT book. Straight away there is a ramped descending  passageway...despite asking at the car park entrance about level ground I wasn't told about this!  Once inside, the only area we could get to was the lovely herb garden and lawns around it. Such a beautiful garden and he was unable to enjoy it. Please have more informed staff who understand the needs of wheelchair users. It is  a wonderful place but we left very disappointed. "
2265,"Very helpful, fantastic with my needs and asked what they can do to help."
2266,"I had wanted to go to this wine bar for ages, as it had outdoor seating and was near a car park. However, there are two steps to get in, with no railings for assistance. They are also tall steps which makes it harder. It has seating inside, I am not in a wheelchair, but the space between tables is narrow. Also the only toilets are down stairs."
2267,"Dobbies garden center has a large range of items including clothes (Mainly for more elderly people), food ,  garden furniture and accessories and even fish!"
2268,Transfer was via coach from the airport so this may be a problem. However several chair users arrived via wheelchair taxi from the airport which was only a 30min journey (approx. 20 euro)
2269,"The access is quite good and much better than the old library .I visited shortly after the library was opened so it was very busy.I found some of the walkways a bit narrow so if I was going one way and another wheelchair or pushchair was coming in the opposite direction one of us had to wait.The library itself is  great , great views, a roof top garden, Shakespeare room , places to eat. Lifts to all floors.An interesting place to visit."
2270,We booked a regular table (there are also bench-style tables which are not accessible). Step free access to the restaurant and nice shiny floors to wheel on.
2271,"Staff unhelpful, cant move round the shop easily, if you are in a wheel chair you have no chance, I am a big lady and had to breath in just to get around the whole shop, as one person said ""cant swing a cat around in here"". If there was a fire you would be trapped! Uniforms were far to high up to reach, the floor stands were far to close to each other, creating the scene of everything coming in on, The feeling of claustrophobic, causing unnecessary anxiety, panic attack, stress, disappointment, the  list could go on, staff weren't bothered when complaints were made, they were only interested in the ringing of the till, you might if you were lucky get a member of staff , reach for an item for you..  Its the only school shop in town, else I would have gone somewhere!  "
2272,There are lots of disabled bays
2273,Just the two disabled bays
2274,"There was step-free access at the hotel for communal areas and for our room, and we had a decent accessible bathroom with a step-free shower and shower seat. While I was in the room, I was using a small three-wheeled walker, and it did occur to me that it could be quite cramped in there to get around with a wheelchair, but I think the hotel staff would find a way to help by moving furniture if asked."
2275,We have stayed at Clunie and Girnock cottages there are 2 toilets with a fully functional disabled access toilet with Cols o Mat and wheelchair access showers.
2276,"Would give them 10 stars more than helpful nothing too much trouble
& fantastic cakes too"
2277,Garden Wise is a wonderful place to visit.  The cafe also sells really yummy food.  Sometimes it is quite difficult to navigate around Garden Wise as there can be things lying on the floor which are difficult to see.
2278,"The Stirrup Inn is located in a small village called Willoughton, it is a small pub that is very friendly and welcoming. It has a small beer garden and a small car park. Inside there is plenty of seating options and an area to enjoy playing darts or watching the football on the TV. During winter months it has a lovely roaring fire in a large log burner. This pub does not serve food, however the drinks are cheap! We visited with my grandad who uses a walking frame and struggles with his eyesight at times."
2279,"Small, simple clean toilet, which a wheelchair could turn around in, but nothing to write home about."
2280,Ramped access - not steep - very easy - ideal.
2281,Disabled toilet with plenty of space & grab rails.
2282,Staff friendly and helpful
2283,"Venue is very access friendly. Staff are lovely, toilets are easily accessible. There is also lots of music, lighting equipment and a kitchen."
2284,"There were plenty of staff around.During performance, chatty audience members near us. When staff eventually noticed (even after comedian drawing attention to chatter) all the staff did was stand behind said people and say sshhh every so often. This did not sort out the problem.

I had reserved end of aisle seating on accessibility phone line when booking. However, when I got to the venue, I told staff about this and they said 'you can find yourself an end of aisle seat there are plenty left'. I wonder what might have happened if we were later to the theatre and no end of aisle seats"
2285,"Excellent access, flat, smooth floors.  Can get busy and you can become invisible,  but this is not unique to this venue."
2286,"One Wheelchair accessible toilet door opens outwards this is located next to the laddies and gents toilets and is also the baby change facility as well.
The Red Cord was all the way to the floor which was great to see "
2287,Top of the range and extremely spacious (again see pics).
2288,N street disabled bays or sainsburys across the street. Plenty of parking along Saltcoats shore front. 
2289,Staff were very friendly and helpful.
2290,Some disabled bays available upon booking.
2291,"A beautiful house, fresh and spacious, extremely well equipped with everything we could possibly need.
 
We came to celebrate a Diamond Wedding Anniversary. The Moat House has given us luxurious accommodation to enjoy, whilst catering to our many physical constraints and challenges. We haven't found anywhere else with such good disabled facilities, including commode chair, electric beds, fully accessible bathroom and wheelchair friendly terrain throughout. The great thing is that all this has been achieved at the same time as providing a holiday home feel that worked just as well for our 13 year old daughter and the dog! Thank you to Martin & Nick for going the extra mile to ensure everything was just right for us before we even arrived. It has been very reassuring to feel that we have been cared for throughout.
 
Our top 3 recommendations for things to do in the area are: 
 
1) Del Amitri restaurant at the Powfoot Hotel. Wonderful food with views of the Solway Firth."
2292,If staff and carer and other members of the public think I may have still been in toilet
2293,Spacious and clean 
2294,Accessible adapted toilet facilities in foyer.
2295,"A Wheelchair friendly Contemporary Café & Bar that honours the best in local produce and independent suppliers where possible, with a selection of homemade soup, sandwiches, salad and breakfast. Ideally situated in town centre
"
2296,"The theatre is level access, with electronic doors.  Wheelchair users are seated a couple of rows from the stage at the end of the row near the door.  This can mean you miss a little of the performance but not much.  There is a lift up to the studio level so all performances should be wheelchair accessible."
2297,"Husband and wife team 'Peaches & Pear' run this amazing restaurant in Budapest. The food is amazing, and the terrace is lovely to sit on in the warm weather. "
2298,Staff were friendly in the restaurant as were the security staff and lift operators.
2299,"Automatic doors and level access make things easy. Inside there is plenty of space to move around. Access to the upper floors is by a smallish,  but manageable lift. Access to the lower ground floor is by a glass lift. This wasn't working when we arrived but the very helpful staff soon managed to get it working and were very apologetic."
2300,"Although unable to go inside myself because of the virus, one of our party went in for me to check out the access.  There is a ramped entrance to enter the hotel and bar and an automatic door.  
I would have given more stars if the hotel had a clear accessibility statement on their website; they only say that they have rooms on the ground floor and a walk-in shower but they don't have any disabled rooms per se and they don't have a lift (I phoned to confirm this). "
2301,"Accessible coffee shop in pedestrianised town centre. Spacious inside , plenty of outside seating available . Home baking , good coffee , and tasty fresh salad and snack menu. Plenty of vegan options. Staff friendly and helpful. "
2302,There is good access and spacious lifts. The entrance has a platform lift to get you to the reception area.
2303,"When asking how wheelchair accessible is Geographic Bar and Restaurant Javea, the answer would be positive but mixed. There are several areas of seating areas at Geographic Bar and Restaurant.

Inside the restaurant itself, It is wheelchair accessible but the tables at the front where the lovely view of the sea is, are packed into this area so you may get a feeling of being penned in. In the current climate of Covid, there is plenty of space between tables.
There is more spacious seating at the rear of the restaurant where the small cafe counter is, selling cakes and other treats. This area also has an open fire in the winter months. A real treat at Christmas time.
Geographic is all on one level. The disabled access entrance is at the side of the restaurant. There is approximately a one-inch lip at this entrance which could be challenging for some. A large electric wheelchair could get around but you may have to ask others to move for you. We tend to towards the rear where it is a little more spacious.  The entrance at the side has a small lip."
2304,please see my review
2305,"We saw a staff member as we were driving into Crombie and my helper asked about the accessible parking within the park as I hadn’t visited in a while and didn’t know if it was still there. She was very helpful and pointed us in the right direction however, I thought she would have offered to open the gate as we spoke to her not far from it.

Apart from then I didn’t interact with any staff or even saw anyone."
2306,"Lots of toilets dotted around the museum, sometimes a little hard to spot but generally very good. Clean and tidy from what I've experienced!"
2307,Well signposted disabled door. Staff saw us parking so we're waiting at the door but there's a bell you can use to gain access
2308,"The café in the crypt of St Martin’s can be accessed from a very new lift on the street besides the church. The lift is roomy enough to turn around in if you want to exit it forwards. You exit into a gift shop, but there are no stands near the lift that obstruct access. Turn left to go into the café; the floor is made of slightly bumpy stone slabs, but is easy enough to cross in a wheelchair.
The café tables are all spaced apart well, allowing easy traversal between them. They are all of normal height & thus can be reached from a wheelchair. The counter where food is bought is quite low down, & staff are willing to carry trays if needed. I did notice that there was a lift up into St Martin’s itself to one side, and the church does have a ramp in, making the whole venue quite accessible.
"
2309,No dedicated accessible loo. Ladies' through reasonably heavy door and then standard cubicles.
2310,Motability accredited dealership so you know what to expect. All facilities adapted and welcoming friendly staff
2311,"I used Béatrice Taxis from La Rochelle and on the way there I was in a people carrier, on the return trip I used the same taxi company and they had got me a people carrier with a pull out step, which made it easier to get in and out. The driver was extremely helpful and took my luggage into the hotel. Alternatively there is buses which run throughout the day connecting Ile de Re to La Rochelle. The nearest bus stop is Saint Martin de Re Le Port and it is a 1 minute level walk to the Port. In the Spring - Autumn if you are driving to access the port area requires a code, which your hotel should give you and there is a charge for the car parks. There are direct flights in the summer season from Gatwick to La Rochelle with an actual flying time of 1 hour 10 minutes."
2312,They would of got a full five but the main lift keeps failing and they dont put signs up in the carpark to inform on what to do 
2313,"As you travel around you will see that most places are disabled friendly enough, either on the level or with provided ramps to help you. You will find places for tea breaks and toilet use with details for disabled access provided."
2314,Helpful and polite
2315,This is one of my regular pubs was asked to do review of a location for a student project so apologise if I miss anything to anyone who actually uses a wheelchair or any other disability. 
2316,Parked right at the entrance.
2317,"This place is very easy for wheelchair users, there are always friendly staff to assist everyone."
2318,"Good access, staff couldn't of done any more but covid precautions were non existent "
2319,There are a couple of car parks within a few hundreds yards and have disabled bays. 
2320,"Wheelchair Accesible, friendly staff, easy to find, good parking, clean toilets."
2321,"There are lots of disabled parking spaces in the trinity car park, but the car park can be expensive (as in the middle of town) and you still need to walk across the road to get to the trinity centre. Once there there is a lift up to the second floor where the cinema is. 
There is also a bus stop across the road, Next to traffic lights if taking public transport. "
2322,"It's placed near a bus stop with many different routes. 
The parking isn't good."
2323,"They won 'Loo of the Year' in the past so you cannot fault their toilets. Clean, accessible. However this next comment is for All Attractions, a Changing Places toilet would be THE best facility ever as it opens up a world of opportunities to 250,000 people who cannot stand and use a standard accessible toilet . They need hoisting so without a CP outings are SEVERELY limited. Special schools,nursing homes day care, groups etc always have to choose somewhere with changing and hoist facility"
2324,Self catering chalets with total accessibility. Everything is well thought out for mobility without sacrificing the overall design. Fantastic view over the Firth of Forth. This was our third visit and we have already booked for next year.
2325,"There is one accessible toilet in the cinema. It is also a baby-changing area.

This has a fixed support to the left side,  and a moving support on the right.
There is enough space for a carer to be there.
"
2326,Plenty of well planned parking space and ramp access available.
2327,There were over 10 disabled parking bays. These are free for residents and very close to the entrance. (See photos)
2328,All on ground floor level with plenty of low level tables. Seating areas with mobile phone charger points. Easy to get to accessible toilet
2329,The venue is really good and accessible for people with a disability have included pictures 
2330,Great place visit this Cafe Nero often. The only negative I would say as a wheelchair user is the large bucket in the disabled toilet is under the hand dryer which makes it difficult to access. Apart from that a great place and staff are welcoming. One more thing the carrot cake is the best I have ever had.
2331,"There are several disabled toilets throughout the shopping centre, that offer ‘changing places’, this provides additional space and facilities, such as a changing table. The toilets can be easily accessed from the main shopping centre, and the other is on the ground floor. 
One main criticism in terms of the toilets is that for them to be accessed you have to have a key, which has to be obtained by the Customer Services Lounge or by a contact number which is on the door. This is not practical and could appear confusing for someone who is blind or cannot read. Additionally, if someone is in desperate need of the toilet this is not appropriate and could result in an accident. 
Another drawback is the toilet doors are quite heavy. In addition to this there is a mirror, however it is not placed at a lower level or at an angle of ease to use.
"
2332,Lots of space on lower level of the cafe and there's a good sized accessible loo
2333,"Easily accessible beside other toilets.  Large, clean and tidy."
2334,Parked in Leys Road carpark
2335,"The accessible toilet today was out of order and there's only one.
From past experience of going there was grab rails and enough room (just) to manouver my wheelchair. There would be enough room for a carer I think.
The emergency red cord was tied up.
I had to use the normal toilet today and it was clean."
2336,If you are visiting the nearby Bo'ness and Kinneil Steam Railway then this can be a pleasant extension to the visit along the waterfront on a nice day.
2337,"At the venue door I asked a member of staff to use the accessible lift access to enter the venue, A member of staff accompanied me to the lift which is round the corner from the venue via an external ramp into a foyer with direct access down into the venue."
2338,Always very welcoming 
2339,"This was the first place I visited as a disabled person, so I didn't know what to expect. But I had a great time and would definitely visit again!

The only part with possibly limited access was the farm. When we went it had been raining, so some of the paths were really muddy and I'm not sure if a wheelchair user would be able to access. "
2340,Friendly in both the garden entrance and the cafe. I did not go into the shop but will go next time.
2341,Prêt's own website lists this branch with 'Wheelchair Access: Yes' but there is a step into the shop and I was not able to enter. They don't have a ramp. Zero stars.
2342,"The main areas are really accessible With automatic door at the entrance and plenty space inside. 
The accessible rooms were good and had plenty of space to move about."
2343,The loo had lots of space easily enough for 1 wheelchair user and a carer. It had enough grabbing rails but wasn't especially clean.
2344,"A great pub for wheelchair users, strongly recommended, apart from the toilet and a broken lift.

If the problems noted below could be sorted out, then this could be a five-star review."
2345,"Close by bus stops and has a car park in front of it, which had 6 blue badge spaces available."
2346,A matter of personal taste but good size for manual transfers with good transfer space. Very grippy floor and all the usual handrails.  Toilet pan slightly unusual back which may not accommodate a portable bidet like I use. 
2347,Well equipped single room. Appropriate rails and space around toilet
2348,"Accessible toilets can be found on all floors. They are clean, spacious, and provide excellent grab rails. I am not aware if any have full changing facilities or not."
2349,"This visit went very well there were were no barriers to getting seated for the show.
The staff were extremely helpful and there were ramps in and out of the theatre.
This venue has high quality shows at a fraction of the price in the cities.
We watched Footloose with Darren Day, Jake Quickenden and Luke Friend.
All the performers sang danced and player a variety of instruments.
A real feel good musical."
2350,"Access to and from the station was easy with lifts to all platforms, an accessible toilet, good signage and helpful staff."
2351,"Wheelchairs and mobility scooters available for free hire (book first) but be aware scooters not allowed in glasshouses which are vast so you'd need to be able to walk a bit or forego the glass houses.  We took my wheelchair trike which got in everywhere except the lift to the aerial walkway (so we did that by wheelchair only).  I could get into most zones within the glass houses though there were a few levels in the Princess of Wales house that had steps, though it wasn't too big a deal.  Cafés all had gentle ramps, as had small gardens.  Didn't try Kew Palace. Site is huge!"
2352,"Plenty Room for wheelchair users, reasonably priced food and drink, however as in many places the disabled toilet doubles as a baby changing room,affecting it's accessibility and room for manoeverability"
2353,"The recent dedesign of the garden, which re-opened in 2013, has ensured full disabled access."
2354,"Excellent space for the disabled to manoeuvre around the aisles.  The restaurant is always busy and that can be a slight problem at times but nothing that cannot be solved.  Disabled toilets are fabulous with plenty of room and everything at the right height.
It is a pleasure to walk around and the outdoor space is terrific for wheelchair etc."
2355,"There is an large accessible toilet to the left when entering the main entrance, by the lift. It was spacious with grab rails and emergency cord (sorry no photo)."
2356,Staff were excellent.
2357,"https://www.sharjahartmuseum.ae/Home.aspx This  Art Museum exceeded my expectations. The building inside was beautiful well ventilated and reasonably well lit they also had features on exhibitions where you could download a bar code  audio description of the picture, The building is wheelchair access a ball with ramps and lifts and the staff could not have been more helpful in terms of helping with opening doors. The exhibitions on display were very interesting and I would certainly recommend anybody going there who happens  to be in the area."
2358,Staff were helpful once you arrived at the individual venues.
2359,"No parking needed as we arrived on a flight. 
On our first visit to Barcelona a friend who is Spanish booked a WAV taxi for us. Because I’m tall and I have a big wheelchair the taxi was very snug. Don’t let that put you off because the service was very good. On our return back to the airport we took the Aerobus, one tip try to get it from a stand and not a bus stop as you are guaranteed a place and you are not rushed, but they do run about every 10 minutes. The metro is at the airport but we have not used it there as the Aerobus is so easy."
2360,Public paid car park next to Mylor Sailing which they have free parking passes for to be used by carers who bring disabled.
2361,"Before Access Day 2019 I had not visited the amazing Discovery Museum in years!

I was pleasantly surprised at just how accessible the venue was overall - there are always areas that can be improved, but for a free Museum in the heart of a busy city, it was a fantastic morning out.

Lots of room for chairs - manual and automatic with gently sloping ramps all connecting to one central lift for access to all floors and exhibits: mostly clear signage, accessible toilets and most importantly well trained and attentive staff. "
2362,The access is surprisingly good as a wheelchair user. You can wheel across the flat grassland area quite easily and get some spectacular views out to sea and over the village and the busy harbour. A slabbed pathway takes you to the visitor centre which is accessible. You can also walk beyond the centre and on to the grassland of the headland. It is a bit lumpy in places but with care you can get some great views out to sea and along the coast. More ambulant visitors can climb the steps and go up to the viewing point about the visitor centre.
2363,The access is generally good with a level door to get in and an automatic opening function. The signage is good and the space is wide and open with plenty of room for different sized wheel chairs etc. 
2364,"Access is good as mentioned before.

A ramp could be more practical than the complicated electric lift.
"
2365,Loo is easy to access and very clean.
2366,"At the very bottom of the restaurant, the accessible toilet is in between the ladies and men's toilets, so watch out for doors opening either side of you as you enter and exit the loo. It's a great sized toilet, very clean and with a good length emergency cord. Half a star dropped for its location at the very bottom of the restaurant, reached by lift or two sets of stairs. "
2367,"There's an accessible loo on the ground floor which was large enough, although could have been a bit cleaner. The door opens out which is good. I'm not sure about upper floors."
2368,Right at door of shopping centre 
2369,We drove but easy to find just past the antiques store! Amble parking
2370,The disabled toilet was clean and spacious BUT had 2 folded wheelchairs inside so my Dad and Nan could not get in till these were taken out.  There is only 1 way to get to it which was slow going.  There was no key needed.  I also have a brother- in-law who uses a wheelchair and cannot walk though he drives.  If he attended here alone he would have struggled with moving the folded wheelchairs.  There were no staff about to assist.  The disabled toilet is mentioned on the site but not the spare wheelchairs in it!
2371,"Approaching the entrance to the Gardens there are loads of cobbles. The trick as a wheelchair user is to stick to the pavement on the building side until you get opposite the entrance - that way you avoid the cobbles. The gardens have a rather uneven layout but the whole area has been covered with artificial grass. There are several theatres and places to sit, grab a coffee, eat and just relax in the gardens."
2372,Decent sized accessible loo located next to the bar. Didn't need to use it on this visit.
2373,"This is a fun shop on the Royal Mile. If you've been to Flying Tiger or Ale-Hop, this store reminds me of them. It is full of random stuff you never knew you wanted! "
2374,"Large open doors to main entrance. Spacious lifts up to top floor where comedy club was. Plenty of room in comedy club its self.
Bar wasn't too busy and was also open and spacious. Got served easy enough.
Didn't use toilet facilities so couldn't comment."
2375,"A group of 12 of us on a stag day/night party pre-booked a meal and the service and quality of food was fantastic. In the ££££ price range with a starter, Main and 2/3 drinks costing around £40. The venue overlooks Albert Docks and can get very busy in the Summer!"
2376,We used a black cab which was to the door  & London buses are accessible. Don't know about parking.
2377,We visited as part of a holiday in Aberdeen.  Any worries we had about how we would cope were quickly resolved by staff at entrance. Our arrival was communicated to the ticket office and we were left to get lunch before our visit and when we got to ticket office one member of staff took us to wheelchair accessible areas of the prison when we could not follow normal route.  He left us to do our own thing and returned to meet us during the visit to guide us where necessary
2378,The tour start point is just inside the gate of the stadium the area is level and there is no steps or ramps once inside the stadium and during the tour you visit the top of the main stand level 6 however wheelchair users and people with mobility problems can use the lifts  through out the stadium and staff will be happy to organise this for you. When using the lifts staff meet you to direct you to the next area as the lifts does go of the tour route at times There is lots of wheelchair space available at all points during the tour even as you go along the side of the pitch. There are steps at the dug out but this is the only place you will find them at the end of the tour at the Kop Stand area you exit via a large door the staff will open this for you after you return the handset you keep the head phones   
2379,"The doorway is narrow, we had to move a display stand to get in. The cafe itself is very cluttered, leading to the unfortunate incident with the Belgian tourist!"
2380,Not too far from the bus station however the closest parking intended for blue badge holders is normally always full and it is not very close to the car parks.
2381,The staff are fantastic. We were shown to a accessible area on a raised platform. This area is not exclusively for disabled people so feels a lot more inclusive. 
2382,"We stumbled on this old Roman Fort after walking down from the canal at the Falkirk Wheel.

It was a lovely sunny day so we had our packed lunch under a tree, might be a little exposed in less nice weather. The information boards with explanations and graphics were really interesting, informative and bought the history of the site to life.   "
2383,"There are no accessible parking spaces directly outside the venue, however it's a very short distance from the Rothesay Ferry Terminal which has accessible parking. "
2384,The disabled parking outside is clearly labelled and also on entering the facility the lift and toilets are clearly signed. There are seats available in reception which can be easily accessed. The facility has no steps on both entrances and is flat which is ideal for wheelchair access. In addition the doors are automatic throughout the facility which is also very useful. 
2385,"It’s all on the level for you, although the garden courtyard, ( as seen on photos, ) does have a step to get down, my knows, he failed to see it, and badly hurt himself when tripping, so watch for these steps, but everywhere else was easy enough. Everything you need to see is on the ground floor, so we do not know if there is a lift or not.
You have plenty of seating areas throughout, and we feel the hotel has done as much as possible to help disabled have a great visit, or overnight stay."
2386,Stewards directed us to disabled parking which was specifically allocated for disabled attendees and this small car park was close to the accessible entrance to the event.  The surface was reasonably smooth in my powerchair and there were a few spaces left when I got there.  
2387,no steps parking right outside
2388,"Very good access. Lots of lifts to all floors . I don’t think there was anywhere that was inaccessible. Most stores seemed to be laid out well enough to allow access, all were step free or hand lifts ."
2389,Parking for Blue Badge holders is a 3 minute walk from the Stadium
2390,"Toilets are available in the Nature Centre during opening times, including accessible toilets.
However, it is important to be aware that if one wishes to go on a long walk round the full Nature Reserve (which may take about 3hrs), the only toilets present in the reserve are the ones in the Nature Centre."
2391,"Good changing place toilet with hoist, changing bed and toilet also a privacy curtain. Lots of room too"
2392,"Clean and tidy accessible loo, easy to find and access."
2393,The staff are all really polite and very attentive to your needs. 
2394,There was a lift up to the main doors but didn't use it as mum managed steps by using the rail. Theatre staff found a chair for mum to sit on before main theatre open ended. Lift up to our seats which were close by
2395,Met the vicar (or deputy / assistant vicar if there is such a position?) briefly - seemed a very nice chap!
2396,It was without doubt the friendliness and helpful tips and suggestions that made out visit. It is for this reason we decided to give the castle the rating we did. We were made to feel welcome and our experience of visiting made us want to come back again! and we will !!
2397,This review is specifically for the path from the forest car park to the pond; as this location is primarily a forest trail for walkers and cyclists only some of it is accessible and anyway there are often steep inclines. The path to the pond area however is mostly flat with only one short section with an incline. This may be a problem for a manual wheelchair user with no assistance. The path surface is generally very good.
2398,Level access into the venue. Most chairs are moveable so pretty straightforward getting a space. Could be trickier at a busier time though.
2399,Good Ferry Terminal with great disabled access and super staff!
2400,Very helpful
2401,No sill at all on the entrance or the exit
2402,They were all very helpful and Amy was assigned to look after us.  She told me where she would be standing if I needed her but I could see that I could have caught the attention of security upstairs too if I had needed it.
2403,"The Michaelhouse Centre, in the ancient St Michael's Church, is the home of a popular cafe in the centre of Cambridge, also hosting art exhibitions, meeting rooms and occasional concerts. It has been excellently adapted to provide full wheelchair access. It also houses a chapel set aside for prayer."
2404,"The toilets can be found at the right-hand side of the bar, and offers a male, female and accessible toilet, with nappy changing facilities. The accessible toilet is spacious with a grab-rail and emergency pull-cord."
2405,Nice cocktails and lively atmosphere/music https://thechelseadrugstore.ie/
2406,Staff were very helpful at the main car park.
2407,"Achilleion is a palace built for the Empress Elisabeth of Austria, often known as Sisi. The palace is more large villa and the rooms are rather modestly furnished inside. The house is step free. However I didn't get a chance to explore the gardens as they are on a hillside with steps. Therefore this review will focus on the building rather than its gardens. It featured in James Bond's For Your Eyes Only. "
2408,Accessible toilet at Ben Eighe visitor centre but not at Torridon.
2409,I really enjoy walking through West Princes Street Gardens! The paths are wide and smooth and you can avoid the steep hills into the garden by entering via King's Stables Road. In the summer months they have deck chairs dotted around on the grass.
2410,From the car park a ramp has been built around the building from the side to the front door. Then if you want to use the garden there are ramps to 3 different levels of garden with also a gate onto the canal towpath again cannot fault these facilities.
2411,Level access but two doors to negotiate. One on a bend. Would need assistance.
2412,"I travelled by public transport. The nearest tube is Piccadilly Circus or Charing Cross, which both have poor disabled access. There are many buses that stop near by, in Piccadilly or Trafalgar Square, and then it is a few minutes walk. I travelled to Trafalgar Square on the bus and then it was a flat 5 - 10 minute walk to the Royal Society, and I think this may be the best option for people with mobility difficulties, as Piccadilly is up/ down a hill."
2413,"I had to postpone my planned visit to The Shard several times due to the Pandemic, and staff couldn't have been more helpful. Each time I received an email back almost instantly, and they changed my booking without any difficulties.

On my visit, staff guide you through each part of the building, and are efficient but friendly.

On the viewing levels, there were staff available if you needed them. Staff also were happy to help take people's photos, although this was not an organised service."
2414,You can park right outside the front door. Accessible buses pass along the nearby streets.
2415,The access to the station at street level was open plan and well sign posted. A clearly marked lift takes you down to the two platforms. The platforms have electronic displays to show the next trains due and these are supported by audio announcements. Getting on the train with a powerchair was easier than expected with a smooth transition from the platform to the train.Look out for the wheelchair symbol on the train as there's a dedicated wheelchair area with plenty of space. The onboard displays and announcements tell you when you are approaching the next station and its name.
2416, There is a tea/coffee hut by the beach but is only accessible over grass. There is a restaurant but you sit inside and they may expect you to eat. 
2417,"Superb friendly, english speaking staff who will go out of their way to help."
2418,"There were no lifts and a lot of stairs, there were limited places we could go."
2419,Very easy and straightforward .
2420,We drove there and were able to park right outside the building. 
2421,There is a good number of accessible toilets and they are a good size so very easy to manoeuvre.
2422,Parking is reasonable at Braehead with a number of disabled parking on the upper and lower level.
2423,"When we arrived at Kings Cross at lunchtime from Edinburgh, we were met by LNER staff, who had been forwarded our details at our point of departure. Our luggage and us were taken and escorted to the left luggage office, which enabled us to utilise our London Pass, then check in to our Hotel in the evening. We were given great directions and information by their staff, could not fault them in any way. This was the same 3 days later on our return journey and arrival at Edinburgh.

Did not use any of the outlets in the Station hub, but there were ample lifts, escalators to the upper food outlets."
2424,"Slightly steep ramp to get into the building, but once in it is all on the same level.
Spacious disabled wet room/ changing room but you have to go through the ladies/ mens changing room to get there, this was a bit of an issue as I struggled to wheel myself through the ladies whilst my boyfriend had to go through the mens!"
2425,"Perfect for a power chair user, and relatively spacious. The kitchen is  not adapted to be used by someone on a wheelchair, e.g. the counter is not low and there is no space for the legs if you are cooking on a wheelchair. But the living room is comfortable and spacious."
2426,I didn't count the number but there were numerous accessible parking bays outside the front entrance - they had space at the rear of the space and at the side of the space for entrance from both angles. The kerb was dropped to allow wheelchairs access to it and the door was less than 10 metres away. 
2427,"All very welcoming, considerate and helpful."
2428,"This garden centre is best accessed by car as it is tucked out of the way and isn't close to any public transport. The car park itself is large and their are a handful of accessible parking spaces close to the main entrance. The surface of the car park is a little uneven, but it's nothing terrible."
2429,There is a large car park adjacent to the theatre with a number of accessible parking spaces.  I would advise arriving early as this can fill up quite quickly.
2430,Toilet accessible with plenty of room for 2 people & a wheelchair also plenty of grab rails.
2431,"Ample access opportunities whether it be from Railway Station, bus or taxi all less than 5 mins from the Market area. Ample parking in Market, Bank and Cockburn Street. All significant bus routes travel past the Market and stops are available throughout the area of the Gardens, the nearest Tram stop is at the Mound, the trams and bus stops also link directly with the Princes Mall, St Andrew Square and George Street Market area which are part of the same Market theme, but over 4 locations. "
2432,"Run by the ever-reliable Red Mist Leisure Ltd., The Cock Inn in Headley (near Leatherhead, Surrey) is deceptively very accessible - it have a lift for wheelchair users hidden on the right - and most elevated - side of the car park. I can get in no problem: they've supposedly also got a ramp by the back door and an accessible loo (although I've never used them.) The service is up to a good standard and i can't resist the food - although it could be cheaper. I'd recommend this pub to anybody and I hope to see more people there. The only downside could be it's rural location but nobody can really help that. In order to visit a car's a must!"
2433,On street parking with local bus services a few streets away. 
2434,"Getting to Waterloo East: all National Rail services at the main station, Waterloo, have step-free access, and there is a pedestrian bridge, with lifts, to get you from Waterloo to Waterloo East. On London Underground, only the Jubilee Line has step-free access at Waterloo. The Northern and Bakerloo lines at Waterloo (a major London terminus!), are no-go areas for wheelchair users. Many buses serve Waterloo Station. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area."
2435,very friendly and helpful
2436,"My son recommended this restaurant to us. I use a wheelchair and the site was totally accessible, there were wide spaces between tables, an accessible toilet and great service"
2437,"Good circulation space, tasty food, reasonably priced. "
2438,Keen to help.
2439,"Very wheelchair friendly, lots of accessible parking right at the door. Staff were extremely helpful and accommodating. This place is just off the Kingsway heading Northbound, great as a stop off on a long drive for a coffee or as a meal out with the family. I would recommend this place highly!"
2440,"They can provide community transport with busses with a tail lift. 
There is a ramp to get into the building and suitable toilets.  
Easy disabled parking is available. "
2441,Great tube links (just beside London Bridge tube station on the Jubilee line). Very limited parking options.
2442,Staff are very friendly and can't do enough to help
2443,There are step free access and lifts within the building to take you to whatever level you need to be at.
2444,"The two men who brought the wheelchair ramp were friendly, helpful, and apologetic about the fact that although they could let me into the shop, I would not be able to browse anywhere except on the ground floor. As I wanted to browse menswear, which is all upstairs, this was not much use to me. The staff did, however, offer to bring me anything I wanted from upstairs. I appreciated their thoughtfulness and helpfulness, but this is really no substitute for being allowed to browse like anyone else."
2445,This is a Wetherspoons pub in the former Woolworths building and though it does not have its own car park (hence only 4.5 not 5 stars) it is fairly easy to get to. 
2446,"Access is excellent throughout, as one would expect of a hotel for people with disabilities. Although the hotel is set in a Victorian house, it has been well adapted. There are eight single and eight twin-bedded rooms, all of which have step-free access, as do all the public rooms. A number of the bedrooms have ceiling hoists, and mobile hoists are also available, operated by the hotel's care staff. Most of the bedrooms have en-suite wet rooms and electric profiling beds. Other equipment such as shower chairs and commodes are available for use. The extensive gardens have good paths throughout."
2447,"All on one floor, easily accessible with door assistance on request.  Did not have need to go in - visible at entry to restaurant."
2448,Good but a bit small and cramped.
2449,"As a young Sheffield United fan I want to travel to away matches to back my team and Oldham Athletic seemed like a good idea. I am unfortunately confined to a wheelchair and away grounds can sometimes seem daunting experiences: where is the accessible parking, where are the seats, are they accessible, where are there disabled toilets etc.? Supporting your team is a great feeling (especially when you win) and with an understanding of the problems you might encounter, I want to share my experiences of football grounds with you so you can feel a bit more confident about stadium accessibility in the future."
2450,"This is an HNS Lanarkshire venue and is on a pedestrian area of Graham St. There are two ways in to the building via the Main entrance on Graham St or via the rear of the building from the car par area. 
if you enter via the main entrance there are a few steps however the door is also level with the Street as well.
There are lifts to all of the 3 floors with in the building from both entrances. There is also a reception desk at the front entrance this was not in use when we visited."
2451,"Spacious wet room with shower and left transfer loo.

Second accessible toilet with right transfer loo."
2452,"When I arrived there was only 1 member of staff at receiption and there was quite a long queue. Eventually a second member of staff arrived. As mentioned above I had to wait to be served. The member of staff was polite and helpful. The issue was not the staff themselves but the level of staffing.

Receiption were very helpful, when I left I forgot to pack my phone charger and I phoned up the hotel, they checked my room there and then and posted it out to me at no additional cost."
2453,"Bar/restaurant staff were very helpful - moved tables to accommodate us, very pleasant and friendly."
2454,Very helpful. Held doors open where necessary. Must have good staff training!
2455,"The macrobert arts centre is very accessible to people with disabilities. All the spaces are wheelchair accessible. Even backstage and getting on to the stage is accessible. You can go on the stage via a locked door which goes through to backstage, you can go through the prompt side door to get on stage or you can go on stage via a stage door beside the auditorium. The macrobert has relaxed screenings for people with hypersensitivity and autism. They also have an 18+ drama group for people with disabilities and additional support needs."
2456,A number of accessible toilets around the mall
2457,Large disabled toilets available on the Rose Street level and also down on the food court level.
2458,"Very good and helpful, all spoke English to some degree as well. "
2459,"A lovely place where we often go for lunch in their fantastic restaurant. On leaving I needed to use the toilet and since I`d had a stroke 6 weeks ago, used the `disabled` one. On entering the main entrance to the toilet area was `mother and baby` and right down at the furthest point was the disabled one,  surely these would benefit from being the other way round?  Once inside the  rail that surely should fold down, didn`t,  so there was nothing to help me lower myself onto the loo which I felt was far too low down for any disabled users. I will think twice before visiting again ,  just in case I need to go. "
2460,Great parking. Shopmobility. Changing Places facilities. Friendly.
2461,An excellent experience
2462,Could have had the bay painted.  
2463,"wide ramps going into the buliding from the car park, buttoms on doors to help the phyically disabled open them, quite large lift available and some use of signs and symbols around the buliding "
2464,"They have a easy drop off point for those who have mobility issues with a covered walkway. The meet and greet parking was excellent. We stayed at the on site hotel and booked an accessible room with only one nights notice.
A steep incline to get to the terminal though is the only issue."
2465,"The lady at the counter was very helpful and spoke directly to me and my friends, she carried my drink over to my table. It was quiet enough so she could also hear my friend’s communication aid to order his drink and she spoke directly to him."
2466,Costa coffee Saltcoats is a nice place to stop if you’re in town. The coffee has an accessible toilet which is quite small. The toilet has handrails around it there are manual doors at the front of the cafe Which you would need assistance with.
2467,Large car park.
2468,"For an undulating grass covered square the complex is fabulous. With boardwalks and a variety of carpeted tents and structures it is easy to wheel around. Plenty of signage to help you find the way and spots to rest a while and enjoy an ice cream or a drink. A lovely children's area, a gigantic book shop, the cafe, the performance stages and much more. Even a quiet space should you need to take a spell out from the noise and bustle of the streets. 

Visiting in the company of friends it was no problem having a gang of wheelchair users all in the same place - sometimes it can be when we've been elsewhere. We felt welcome and part of it just like everyone else.

Performances were inclusive with BSL, multi sensory storytelling, accessible seating and everything to make your visit enjoyable. "
2469,"al though this place is small it does have access for wheel chair users if you register on there acces list they will give you a free ticket for your carer, which is good it has all the usual facilatys for disabled people, the staff are very friendly and will do anything to help if you ask them we have been there twice within the last couple of weeks, seeing this is a teaching theatre they do a very good job of looking after the disabled,  

parking is the only disadvantage here but you can drop off outside the door."
2470,There is a very well equipped changing places toilet with bifold door and all facilities for toileting and changing. There is a basic accessible toilet in the cafe. This has a heavy spring to the door and no alarm facility.
2471,"We parked at the ferry terminal which was fine, there was no specified disabled bays there, we just waited in a line until it was time to board the ship. We checked in and received our boarding passes and proceeded onto the ship, we parked right by the lift 
and headed up, we were met by the ships purser and we were showed to our cabin, the cabin was good and clean, as we were in two wheelchairs it was a little bit of a squeeze. But we were able to adjust by using one wheelchair for using the toilet and shower room. There would be plenty of room for one wheelchair and carer or partner."
2472,Two heavy doors up a small ramp
2473,"The National Park Centre is at the top of Sutton Bank. They have a scooter which is free to hireand a leaflet detailing a 5 mile all abilities walk consisting of two loops. We took the southern loop and enjoyed views right acrossthe Vale of York and Eastwards to the Pennines. The track passes the glider air field and it was fascinating to watch them taking off over our heads.
Back at the Centre there is lots of information about the area, and the adjacent cafe is fully accessible."
2474,"I am in a wheelchair, had a fantastic time with all my husbands Scottish family, either staying with us or visiting.
Had great weather, the younger children loved playing outside with my husband (their great-uncle).
All in all a FANTASTIC holiday."
2475,Parking right outside cottage door.
2476,I managed to find a space relatively easily considering it is December.
2477,Was told there was a disabled toilet on first floor but no lift and no means to access
2478,Not many parking spaces - however was bank holiday
2479,4 disabled bays in large car park with level access throughout centre.
2480,Very pleasant and helpful.
2481,There are disabled toilets where you get the boat from (Pooley Bridge) and to (Glenridding). However the toilets on board are below deck which is down some steps and they are not disabled toilets and are very small.
2482,Just stopped for a loo break.  Disabled toilet facilities all ground floor.
2483,I have visited by car using one of the 12 blue badge parking spaces in the middle of Exhibiton road. I have also come by train and taxi via Waterloo station. The taxi fare is around £10- £12 each way.
2484,Because of the hotels location there is no disabled parking or drop off at the hotel. The road behind the hotel is where we used to set-down to unload/load but for me in a power chair this was not a problem.
2485,"All staff and volunteers were friendly and offered specific advice on access, routes etc.  The lady on duty inside the building saw that my family had left me outside while they went in and she came out specifically to check I was ok and to see if she could tell me anything , and was I finding the access ok."
2486,"Very friendly and helpful. Dogs are welcome too, they may even get a biscuit!"
2487,Super people - friendly and very helpful. One member of staff helped my wife to transfer from her wheelchair to a cafe seat while I went to order food and coffees.
2488,Historic village parish church with step free access.
2489,"There are many accessible toilets, both the ones I used were spacious, well-designed, well laid-out, and 100% fit for purpose."
2490,"There is a disabled toilet in the foyer. There is also a magnificent accessible changing room with 2 height adjustable beds, 2 showers & toilet with grabrails. there were also lockers & the aforementioned trach hoist. "
2491,"We wanted to visit Malvern Museum of local history (photo 1). We left Rose bank gardens, (photo 2) down a very steep sloping path to reach cobbled street of Belle vue terrace (photo 3). Through the museum arch (4) and arrived at steps of Malvern museum. (5) the original gateway, with restricted access for disabled, and far to many steps to even bother to go inside. here they house the water cure room, with old wet treatments, and Malvern hills room with prehistoric and Roman activity.
Then back to arch (6) and uneven steps before the hard effort of getting back up steep pavements to Rose bank gardens.
We cannot recommend you to even try this difficult approach to museum."
2492,"Really upsetting. 2 sets of stairs to get to a cafe + spectactor zone, no lift. "
2493,The accessible Wetrooms were some of the best we have ever stayed in!
2494,"Very pleasant, happy to help - although when confronted with access issues, they listened well, but did not really know how to respond"
2495,"Parking facilities for away supporters are located off Queens Road by the Barnsley metrodome leisure facility. The parking spaces are on quite a steep hill with only a few spaces that provide parking with flat access and it is possible that you may get blocked in, with a long wait to get out at the end of the game. However, if you get to the ground early there are spaces outside the metrodome leisure center, which are a lot more spacious and easier to use for people who are less ambulant, yet these are a bit of a walk from the stadium."
2496,Great bar and restaurant that is level access and spacious enough for wheelchair users.
2497,The theatre is located in the town centre and has great parking available with disabled spaces to the front and side; parking is free in the disabled spaces.  It's a short walk from the nearest bus-stop and about 10 minutes walk from the Inverness Train station.
2498,Great
2499,We rocked up and my pal had forgotten his CEA Card - but the staff were super helpful and allowed us to get a free Carer's ticket anyway. Overall the cinema has good disabled access but it is worth finding out which screen is showing which film beforehand as some have a better view than others.
2500,"The Great Hall hosts all University of Leeds graduation ceremonies, and I have been both as a graduate, and a guest at someone else’s graduation.
The disabled access into the hall is via the Clothworkers Yard, to the left of the main entrance. On graduation days going to the main entrance and displaying your ticket will prompt a porter to escort you to this entrance. The paving stones in this yard have one or two small protruding edges, but mostly provide smooth access to the button-operated automatic door. The corridor leading from the door to the lift, and from the lift to hall is narrow and it can be difficult to manoeuvre around corners.
The lift door swings outwards, so you cannot position yourself opposite the door as you wait for it to arrive. It is just large enough for one wheelchair user and one standing person to fit into. At the top the lift door also swings outwards, and there is a pillar to the right of the lift. There is room to manoeuvre, but it is tight and a little awkward. The entrance into the hall is double doors, which are propped open until everyone has entered the hall. Once in the hall, chairs can be moved to accommodate wheelchairs as needed. There is one seating area on an inaccessible mezzanine level at the back of the room, but everything else is accessible.
There is a lift on one side of the stage that allows disabled graduates to collect their certificates and have their photo taken just like the able-bodied students, but if preferred the certificate can simply be passed to you from the stage by a porter."
2501,I was surprised how spacious the toilet was bearing in mind the overall size of the museum.
2502,"All the toilets have a disabled loo, which is spacious and has grab rails with its own private sink. The wheelchair can move around easily without feeling tight or inclosed and if a carer is needed there would be enough space for two people. The grab rails by the toilet make it easier for the individuals to support themselves  when independently using the toilet. The accessible toilets are always the cleanest. "
2503,The toilet in the room wasn't a good size plenty room to move around in and park next to the toilet to do a sliding transfer. Plenty of grab rails. The toilets at reception area also a good size and has a passcode to get  into which stops everyone from using it.
2504,"The CalMac ferry over from Oban seems to be a bit disorganised we arrived at 6 am after a long drive and there were no toilets open until 7:15 at the check-in. The ferry company has done it's best to make the ferry covid-19 safe.
The return ferry from the island had a very steep access ramp and I was lucky I had a strong person to push although help was available from the ferry company
The parking at the bunkhouse was completely flat and wheelchair accessible"
2505,"The disabled toilet is not really large enough for carer and wheelchair. it was not as easy as in some to assist  with the transfer, but it is clean and modern."
2506,"The disabled toilet was combined with baby changing, hence a queue, although not modern there were grab rails ang the wheelchair did fit inside.  Apparently used to be the stables."
2507,"There are accessible toilets in both the main museum building and Mail Rail. In the main building there are toilets on the ground floor next to the self service counter in the café. There are a number of individual unisex toilets, some of  which also have a wheelchair symbol on the door. In the accessible toilets there are grab rails and an emergency alarm, although the cubicle I used the cord was clipped onto the grab rail.
In Mail Rail the toilets are on the lower floor. The signage for the accessible toilets in the Mail Rail was non existent. I raised this with staff when I was there and they said they would address it. There is a large screen with seating, which is separate from the  Accessible Rail Mail Show. Either side of the screen are doorways which have the unisex toilet sign at the entrances. There was no accessible toilet sign. Looking face onto the giant screen through the right hand doorway is an accessible toilet with grab rails but no emergency cord and only a unisex toilet sign. There is also another door which has a triangular fire notice on it, which gives the impression of it being a cupboard, and it was only on closer inspection that we realised that the lock was for a radar key. I used my radar key and discovered that it was a Changing Places toilet, with a bed, screen, hoist, grab rail but no emergency alarm."
2508,The disabled access is good but if you suffer from spinal injuries than there isn’t any rides you can go on only at your own risk but that’s widely known. The reason for my low score is that the sealion show hasn’t got any places for those in wheelchairs/mobility scooters. So I wasn’t able to see anything due to everyone standing around the front of the poolside area. 
2509,We didn’t use any public toilets so I cannot comment on them.
2510,"Able to book a guaranteed disabled accessible room online.  Hotel very close to motorway M6 junction 13, so easy to find."
2511,"Really good! Doors into the ticket area are automatic. There is a lift which takes you up to the gallery, lots of open space and smooth floors to move around. There are benches to sit on as well. When you arrive at the exhibition you are offered an audio guide, and upstairs there are large print text booklets to accompany the exhibition. This is good because the interpretation panels are quite small. The doors into the gallery via staircase are beautiful (check out the sculptured handles!) but they are quite heavy. Thankfully a gallery curator is always stationed here and will open the door for you. "
2512,"Meal for 2. Easy to get in as staff hold doors open. Easy to move about. Very close, very good disabled toilet. And food out of this world!"
2513,It's a transport hub so that means it's facilities are great. The assistance team are wonderful.  The taxi rank is a long way from the platform's but there's good signage and a lift for access.  I'm not sure how accessible the tube station is.
2514,"small, another heavy door, no way to prop the door open so you're battling with the door and trying to wheel in."
2515,Staff were helpful and friendly.
2516,The accessible loo was a very good size with plenty space for turning etc.
2517,Disabled parking places at front door
2518,The staff are very good and helpful. I would suggest that if you have booked Passenger Assistance you ensure that they are aware of you requiring help as the Customer Service Point is always busy.   
2519,Good all around place staff was great and helpful lift for wheelchair was a bit tight but working well did book to go this year but Corona virus stopped me they gave me a call and got full refund 
2520,Arriving to get a ticket  the staff were very helpful. The ticket area was accessible to me as a wheelchair user. The gift shop was nicely laid out with the majority of items easily visible from wheelchair height. Entering the Palace area through the archway staff indicated the accessible route and took me via a lift up to the main apartments. Only a small area of the historic building was not accessible and pictures were available to see what it was like. The grounds had paths that were wheelchair accessible and it was possible to view the Abbey ruins.
2521,"Access for most of the route, approximately, 500 metres, is barrier free. The section in St. Mark's Park comprises a gravel pathway and does have a fairly steep slope upward as it comes into the main part of the park."
2522,"There is an extremely good ceiling hoist, profiling bed, masses of ground floor space and a beautiful and restful room on the first floor for families/carers. The wet room is a good size and a shower trolley was provided free of charge. There was a small trolley and bowl provided for bed bathing: everything about the accommodation pointed to a real and deep understanding about caring for people with profound disabilities. The building is bright and well designed with pleasant garden space and glorious views."
2523,Both visits staff were very friendly and welcoming. 
2524,"There was a nice big clean accessible loo onboard with rails that were fine for me. Beware, though, that this is the only accessible loo and also serves as a changing place for babies, so you might have to queue a while to get in. I was lucky to only have one person in front of me, and when I came out there were several increasingly impatient parents with prams."
2525,My parents are both elderly and have mobility needs. The Lodge has been very thoughtfully designed with wheelchair users and those with mobility needs in mind. there is a downstairs bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom has low level fittings and plenty of hand rails and is a wet room. The kitchen has low level adjustableunits and the doorways downstairs are wide enough to accomodate a wheelchair.
2526,Many of the disabled spaces are actually free even in high season. People are great and do not park in them. 
2527,"The road parallel to the restaurant is a main road which has trams running along. I didn't use the tram while I was there so unable to comment, apart from I noticed that the new trams had wheelchair signs by one of the doors."
2528,No disabled toilet
2529,"20+ specific wide bays for the disabled - but these are not always monitored. The bays are well marked out and there are a good number here, however it can get very busy and you can end up missing out."
2530,"Loved it! Easy to get around. Lift to take you  up to biomes entrance level. 
Plenty of directions, wide paths. "
2531,"Leeds City Museum offers an exciting, fun and interactive day out for all the family. There are six galleries for you to visit as well as a changing programme of family friendly exhibitions, check the website for latest exhibitions.
Come and find the Leeds Tiger in the Life on Earth Gallery or get interactive by camouflaging yourself.

Investigate the varied collections of Leeds Museums and Galleries in the Collectors Cabinet Gallery. Find out more about world cultures in the World View Gallery, which has a new theme for 2014 of the Voices of Asia. All that in one building!"
2532,Top marks to the friendly and helpful staff - no struggling with doors here or wondering how to get the coffee cups to the table or thinking I wonder if as staff were happy to answer questions and do what they could to be helpful.
2533,"The café is in Teignmouth town centre, which is a five minute level walk from the train station. Teignmouth train station has step free access available. There are also a number of local buses that stop near by."
2534,Bus stops nearby and it's near the meadows area of town which is pretty accessible.
2535,Staff are excellent and have provided me with assistance over and above the norm. All have receive d & I training.
2536,Outstanding-enormous and with a big changing platform if required. A hoist too. And even a mirror at the correct level for a wheelchair user!!!
2537,"Large car park, mobility scooter accessible"
2538,"easy route in , long ramps to access the different levels and lifts to the observatory. Automatic opening doors made entry really easy and masses of space in reception area. The visitor centre was busy on the day we went , but still felt there was lots of room for wheelchairs and didn't once feel I was an obstruction!"
2539,There is a buzz door that can be tricky to do but the do come and open it for you 
2540,Easily accesible toilet/shower wetroom with sliding door
2541,A fairly spacious accessible toilet. 
2542,Clean and spacious
2543,"As mentioned above, prompt ramp deployment the moment I appeared."
2544,The assist member of staff for the evening  found me when I arrived (it hadn't occurred to me to phone and enquire about assists) and proceeded to ensure that my visit to the Apollo was a special one. She was friendly and knew what my concerns would be without me having to voice them. She was able to arrange a more suitable seat for me and regularly checked on me asking if there was anything else she could do for me. She was also assisting others in between times.
2545,"There is an accessible toilet beside the disabled parking spaces which is very spacious however, it is only a standard accessible toilet. I commented last year that there is no Changing Places toilet on site or anywhere in Pitlochary, and the organisers took that on board. This year they have hired a Mobiloo Changing Place, which is basically a van that a Changing Place toilet in it. This is a great feature to have because it makes everyone feel more included. The only problem I would say though is that it is quite hidden. Even though I was told where it was when I arrived, it maybe would have been good to have a few signposts. 

There are portacabin disabled toilets on site, however even though I am unable to use these I tried to fit in and if you could transfer yourself there may be enough room. But if you need someone to help you then there would not be enough room."
2546,I came via bus but do know there are blue badge spaces next to the cafe area of the park.
2547,"Good accessibility for wheelchair users throughout the shop, which is all at ground floor level. Well worth a visit."
2548,Very helpful and pleasant.
2549,"There were allegedly accessible loos on all the floors we visited, but the Institute's idea of an accessible loo is a large room with a low level toilet at one end, an accessible washbasin at the other and no grab rails or alarm system. Side transfer would in theory be possible but difficult, perhaps even dangerous in the absence of grab rails. Wheelchair user and accompanist really struggled to make use of this facility, and there was no loo paper."
2550,"We decided to go along there primarily for the karaoke, as it is hard to find accessible venues in Edinburgh. They do a karaoke and buffet deal, although there has to be a minimum of 20 people. The staff were very helpful, and it was clean! The food was delicious and had a good selection."
2551,"My husband  and I stopped here for a meal on our way home after meeting family and friends, at the kelpies near Falkirk.
We booked our table online for dinner early evening. When filling in the form there is space for you to state any requirements you may have that they should be aware of. I requested a table suitable for me to sit in my wheelchair for my meal. Upon arrival we were greeted by the receptionist 
who showed us to our table which they had already removed a chair from ready for my wheelchair, my husband and I both had steak which was cooked just as we requested . I also had a red wine sauce and my husband a bbq sauce plus a side of onion rings . The whole meal was very good, the staff were very helpful. Opening and closing doors upon our arrival and departure. There was plenty of room for me to get round the restaurant in my wheelchair, they have disabled parking near the entrance. You enter the restaurant via a slop. All wheelchair accessible. All staff work masks and there was plenty of cleaning of tables and staff cleaning hands between doing tasks."
2552,"Access very good at the assembly hall. Ramps and lifts, accessible disabled toilets very helpful staff. Great place for all with any disabilities. Fantastic night stress free"
2553,"All festival venues are wheelchair accessible and there are multiple nearby ADA compliant hotel options, including the festival's hotel partner, the Hyatt Ka'anapali.  Staff, crew and volunteers of the festival go above and beyond to accommodate wheelchair users and their caregivers - including front row seats for most shows .  Overall, a great event and worth the trip to Maui!"
2554,The table isles are fairly spacious and if you can transfer you are able to put your mobility equipment out of the way.they are also wide enough to drive down easily.Cater for low carb diets
2555,The access to the conference centre is fully wheelchair accessible with a buzzer system in place which opens automatic doors. Once you get inside it is very easily sign-posted so that you can find where you are going. It is usually used for conferences or training days.
2556,"The main car park was spacious and well laid out. There are, however, plenty of disabled spaces at the rear of the main building. They are accessed through an alternative entrance and signs from the main road should be followed. The spaces themselves are near to the main facilities."
2557,"The car park is on site and even has a generosity box for fresh eggs if you want them; although there are no specific disabled spaces, it’s so quiet out there that you wouldn’t have any problem accessing a space, and if you did, I’m sure the staff would try to find you a parking space.  As it's in the country, you would have to drive or take a bus to the next village of Kiltarlity but it's a bit too far to walk or wheel if you have mobility difficulties."
2558,"On the level but off one of the two rooms, so make sure you're booked into 'the room with the loo' (sorry!). "
2559,There is a toilet in the reception area by the breakfast room and lounge area. This is spacious and had a single grab rail. 
2560,"It was really easy to get around the hotel in my powerchair, corridors restaurant etc.,
When we were staying there one of the lifts was out of action which caused queues to get into the list most of the time.
One annoying feature was the height at which the reception desks was at.  I had to get my daughter to use the card machine to pay the account, which was annoying.
One other thing that annoyed me was the softness of the pillows, but perhaps  I ought to have asked if they had firmer ones."
2561,I travelled by taxi from/ to Temple Mead Station. Taxi had to park up in a parking bay a few yards away from the hotel entrance. Reception staff booked my taxis and they always turned up as requested. Sorry unable to comment about public transport/ car park facilities.  
2562,There is a disabled toilet and grab rails however the placement of grabs rails made this a challenge for myself. 
2563,Toilets are a free for all and not monitored. During our visit local workmen were in and out  as we other members of the public. Unacceptable.
2564,"Very helpful,as i said the lady at the front of house allowed me to use my own power chair."
2565,"All the staff were courteous and pleasant, we were impressed by the keenness of the warden when he saw us getting the scooter out of the car, as he wanted to make sure it was suitable for purpose, and told us that we could use one of the centers' scooters if we so wished."
2566,I used the toilet on the upper floor where the drinks reception was held. The accessible toilet was spacious and clean with grab rails. The emergency cord was wrapped around the grab rail and I untied it.
2567,"Access to the stadium for away fans is through a big gate.

The toilets and the snack bar is easily accessible."
2568,"I encountered one member of staff, who not only deployed the metal ramp to give me access to the east end of the cathedral, but was also happy to chat to me at length about the history of the building, and to show me several pictures. He gets five stars for this. But the overall staff rating loses two stars because of the very annoying toilet situation, and because of the heavy paraphernalia blocking the foot of one of the stone ramps in the south aisle."
2569,"All the staff we had contact with were very friendly and polite. For me the OCS teams were FIRST CLASS with the Eagle Lifter. I might add Belfast International Airport is the only airport on the island of Ireland with an Eagle Lifter. I had two men on the inbound flight and a lady and a man on the outbound flight, both teams done OCS proud. "
2570,"Easy to find, very large, and clean. "
2571,There is an accessible toilet in the cafe area. This area is through a door which is a tight squeeze but when in the toilet there is decent amount of space.
2572,"Located around the corner from the L’ills Diagnal shopping centre, this tapas restaurant has a variety of food and drinks to satisfy. As the sun was shining, we sat outside to enjoy our food, peace from the busy interior. Staff were happy to move things around to accommodate my needs."
2573,"Staff were good, apart from ordering drinks didn't really interact with staff but were friendly when we did."
2574,All staff are very helpful. Walking on air volunteers particularly so. 
2575,"Generally pretty good apart from the lack of accessible toilet (from what I could see). Most of the seats were lowered and moveable. The bar was high, however they do table service which is great. It's not too dimly lit either, with big sparkly lights throughout. "
2576,The car park is large but there are only two or three dedicated disabled slots. However we have always managed to find a suitable alternative if these are full.
2577,They don't claim it to be perfectly wheelchair friendly. It is accessible but doesn't have wide doors or lowered surfaces. My power chair had a slight problem getting over the front door threshold but with a shove we managed.
2578,"Steps to access front of hotel,  no railings for support. Disabled access at rear of hotel, no signs to advise where disabled access is.
Accessible verandah overlooking grounds and Solway Firth
Function room fully accessible, all public rooms roomy and accessible .
Bedrooms available on ground floor, unsure if accessible rooms.
Hotel is currently installing a lift to upper floors."
2579,"Yellow line Parking, public car parks and buses (Accessible)"
2580,"It was all on same level, and plenty of space around the tables."
2581,Level access from entrance and  throughout this the tables are very well spaced so during my visit it was very easy to get to the toilet and exit without disturbing anybody else..
2582,The staff are very warm and friendly. The atmosphere in the cafe is very relaxed and homely. 
2583,This venue is right on London's Southbank - so very close to Waterloo station.
2584,Lots of busses pass right by the restaurant and their is stop just a few steps outside. 
2585,"Wheelchair friendly cinema with some of the most helpful staff we have come met. Slightly unusual in that all cinemas are at basement level with access via a lift from the ground floor. Small foyer but all facilities - e.g. Wheelchair spaces, accessible toilet. The staff were incredible - opening doors, switching on house lights to allow us to find our seats while the adverts and previews were screening."
2586,This is in the city so parking won't be easy. However it is on the bus routes from town to Morningside and is not far from the 27 and 10 routes.
2587,We had no trouble getting a place in the on-site parking.
2588,Very helpful
2589,This race course isn't particularly wheelchair accessible but it is doable......it's a lovely setting but the buildings are in need of an upgrade.
2590,"accessible toilet, 1 per floor"
2591,"Parking is available on the road right outside the door in a part-time bus lane, which is in operation during rush hour. During these times you can park on side streets."
2592,"Although we could have used the First Class lounge on arrival and departure we had no need to. First Class Service  to London for us beats air travel  from Edinburgh anytime, no changes, transfers and waiting for just one of the various links in the chain to have a delay or cancellation. There was a rail strike that affected Heathrow. The underground from Kings Cross superb, but busy, congested and fast. Suggest you use your direct debit card for travel as a contactless payment, there were problems with machines taking Oyster Travel Cards and the ticketing machines were busy with long queues."
2593,Loved this place! The accessibility was good and the food was amazing!
2594,"Various shorter flat trails to visitor farm, café  & playpark (through cobbled courtyard).
 Trail goes downhill to riverside- accessible in a pavement scooter."
2595,no problems
2596,"I didn't have need to ask assistance from staff, but generally they were friendly and helpful.
"
2597,The staff seemed friendly and helpful .
2598,"There is only one accessible toilet, in fact I think it is the only public toilet on the station.  It was just about usable with a large powerchair with a user able to manouevre himself into position.  It was clean but in one of those old cubicles that somehow never feel completely clean.  Better than nothing but really such a busy station should have much better facilities for all - the toilet is often used by parents with children who have nowhere else to go."
2599,"We could park right outside the cottage. Not sure how close the bus comes to this site, but there's a long drive from the road to the cottage in any case. The parking area is level and smooth."
2600,"The view from The Wine Press is actually a public car park, so you're very close to parking and quite a few other bars and restaurants. It's also a short walk from the train station which is great. "
2601,"We drove, in fact it took 4 cars to take all of us and our equipment there! One place on the drive but loads of street parking."
2602,Flat parking immediately outside front door so getting a wheelchair out of the car and into the cottage is a doddle.
2603,Option to sit in a café under the arches or in the alfresco seating area opposite. Some restaurants have some steps.
2604,"The staff were very friendly and helpful. If you are unsure if you would like a certain sauce or dressing to be with your meal, the staff will offer you a sample to taste before ordering. They are also very thorough with allergy advice and will double check anything with the chef. "
2605,Easy access signed and it was very clean 
2606,All on one level .No problem for wheelchairs.
2607,"It has an in-door car park with lift access to hotel, but this cost.
Opposite the hotel  a town car park has three free disabled spaces, this is of course accessable to everyone, so can get busy."
2608,"We were staying in Bath at the Indigo Hotel (review submitted) and had bought my bike and also my husband's Stricker handcycle attachment for his wheelchair along in our car.  The Bath to Bristol Railway Path is a 13 mile route on the national cycle network.  We cycled from our hotel through the town, which was a bit busy and found a path next to the river which we were able to cycle along.  There were a couple of path closures due to repairs and we followed the diversion signs which took us back onto the river path.  The Bath to Bristol railway path starts at Brassmill Lane and when cycling along the river you will see the blue signs which state that the path starts in 500 yards and you have to go along a quiet road to get there.  Once on the railway path its all flat and wide and takes you through lovely countryside and over bridges.  You know you are on the right track as there are quite a few cyclists enjoying the route but it wasn't over busy. We didn.t do the whole route this time but will definately come back to go to Bristol and back next time."
2609,fully accessible to wheelchair users
2610,"Made a real effort to make an old small town property accessible. Level access with gentle ramp into museum. Might be awkward for large powerchairs but my Ottobock B400 was fine and negotiated the corners easily. Gentle ramps between the 2 display rooms in the museum , but again width might be more challenging for a large chair.Space is at a premium with some of the very large mechanical instruments . No problem with one or maybe 2 chairs in a room with others , but don't suggest any more at any one time!"
2611,There is an accessible toilet near the main dining room it is however quite small and the toilet is very low. It has handrails. I put a  card on the red cord during my last visit.
2612,Lots of seating in the reception and social area directly at the entrance. Everything is very clearly signed and the lift is also directly at the main entrance.
2613,Very helpful.
2614,"Couldn't be more suited to those with mobility issues. Spacious, easy enough doors, smooth floors and rewarding views of the Ochil hills while you enjoy great food and drink."
2615,"There is usually a council car park right across the road from this restaurant however, when I visited there was construction going on so there weren't many parking spaces available. I'm not sure if this is permanent or not.

With the restaurant being in Broughty Ferry though and over the bridge from the main high street, there is plenty of on street parking and another council car park roughly a 10 minute walk away.

There are lots of bus stops on the road where this restaurant is and buses pass through Broughty Ferry on a regular basis. The train station is also right across the road, although I don't know how often they stop but I know it's not that much. There is also a taxi rank roughly a 10 minute walk away.
"
2616,"This is an annual exhibition of most things to do with Disabilities.
Ranging from cars and mobility scooters to the more basic needs, what's there changes every year and is quite revealing and very interesting in my eyes."
2617,Very friendly and helpful 
2618,"A big toilet with grab rails, space for a wheelchair and an alarm. "
2619,There is a good size car park. no disables  spaces 
2620,"The nearest tube station South Kensington is not step free. Although the Piccadilly, District and Circle line stop there all the platforms involve steps to the ticket office hall level and then further steps to street level. This is really disappointing. There are a number of buses that stop outside or near to the V and A. I would suggest picking up bus no 14 from Green Park which is an step free station. I arrived in a taxi from Victoria with some of my group, as out of the group of 12 - 14 friends, 3 of us had mobility disabilities."
2621,"Excellent access. Visiting with with two people with physical disabilities - one who uses sticks and the other who doesn't. The majority of the park is very accessible, we just had to take it slowly over some of the paths with stones and the grass. We also went on the safari ride which involved climbing into a jeep - an additional step was provided to make this easier. A fantastic day out!"
2622,"Charlottes ice cream parlour is a fun attraction with farm animals and rides for the children. It also has a café that serves a variety of food, ice creams and desserts. The café has a large easily accessible ramp up to the doorway from the car park that also leads down into the play area. The parlour also accommodates for disabled parking although this is limited. The doors have disabled button access making it easier for customers to open the door that might be in a wheelchair.

 The rides on the site are not disabled friendly rides although there are other options of visiting/petting the farm animals which have wide pathways to accommodate for wheelchairs.The site also has large disabled toilets inside of the café and signs were only in print when listing food choices and menus.
"
2623,"There are no blue badge spaces in the car park however the car park is very large at the weekend it does fill. There is a bus stop near to the venue and both sides of the road. Local buses and First bus in Airdrie all stop at these stops. 
The venue is in Deeds St to get in to the car park you have to go round the back of the building."
2624,"Therr were grab rails and low level units, mirrors, hooks etc in the spacious wet room, making it fully accessible for all users. The heated flooring ensured the room was kept at a pleasant temperature."
2625,"There is step free access into the park. The park is paid out with lawns, rose garden, children's play area, statues and a couple of cafes. There are firm paths and tree lined walkways. There are plenty of benches.
In the park is Rosenborg Castle, which is accessed via a bridge over a moat and then a couple of steps. (I assume there is another entrance to the castle). "
2626,Nice clean accessible toilet
2627,groundfloor disabled toilet – toilet accessible thatheavy doors get through from reception area
2628,Parking is available on site.  The nearest railway connection is Croy Station and there are local accessible bus services.
2629,"No specific parking bays by the West Lake Chalets for disabled drivers and passengers, which is disappointing. Wider bays are essential!"
2630,"All staff were friendly and guided me through the registering process , where to go and explained the one way system."
2631,Very friendly & helpful. There were workmen in when we visited& they were very careful & helpful when we passed them. The lady in the shop told us about the stair lift & a member of staff from the cafe came to take me up in that. 
2632,"Lift access to all levels - you descend into the spacious entrance hall, and then move through into the gallery area, from where there are lifts to all levels. You may be frustrated by the tendency of the able-bodied to hog the lifts when they could perfectly well use the stairs, so be prepared to wait awhile. We hope you don't encounter the American man who peremptorily shouted ""Are you getting out?"" at us when the lift stopped at his level. ""No we blankingly-well aren't, because we've just waited several minutes to get in this lift"" was the gist of the accompanist's response."
2633,Staff were very friendly and welcoming. They asked us about our requirements in the event of a fire upon checking in. 
2634,"Parking is right by the lodge, but isn't flat so we kept having to use the flat parking areas to do wheelchair transfers and hoisting. Doesn't leave a lot of space by the car to get onto the ramp"
2635,All loos are accessible. There are also separate wet rooms with loos so plenty available.
2636,Staff are very used to disabled patrons from the nearby Rehab Hospital and also from a local centre for people with learning difficulties who visit regularly in a large group.
2637,"Scotsdales Garden Centre Cambridge is situated in Great Shelford, south of Cambridge city. There's accessible parking, and good access throughout, including to the excellent and very popular cafe."
2638,Again in terms of access for wheelchairs or assistive aids particular with mobility issues these toilets are not accessible they are down a steep and spiralling stair case. 
2639,The story is fully accessible with step free access and the lift to all levels.
2640,An accessible toilet is off the main shopping aisle.  Large enough for power chair.
2641,there is accessible parking on first floor of car park
2642,Plenty turning space in main bathroom and small toilet is manageable if needed
2643,There is no accessible toilet at the moment however an accessible bedroom with ensuite wetroom (beautiful) was made available for wheelchair users and a portable frame was installed in the ladies toilet for the use of those who required it.  This would have been rated 5stars if there had been a separate accessible toilet.
2644,"Set in beautiful countryside, with fantastic views. The trees in the Garden were all decorated. with fairy lights.
Some of us took The Land Train down to main entrance of the Castle and some preferred to walk.
You can hire a wheelchair free of charge, they also have seats you can carry around with you. The Disabled access is through the shop, but Staff are very willing and helpful, holding doors and pointing in the right direction.There is a Chair  lift for access to The Rooms, (This can take 10mins so allow plenty of time) 
The House was beautifully decorated, they have a different theme each year, the theme this time is 'Christmas Masquerade' each  room is decorated differently too. 
We were lucky to catch the Choir singing in the Long Gallery, this is always good for people living with dementia, we  all joined  in with the Carol singing. 
It is a tradition of ours to always have our photo taken in the Great Hall, beside the 25' Christmas Tree, with its 3000 baubles. There was a String Quartet playing there too, a lovely Christmas feeling.
After looking around the Castle we headed  for a cup of tea and mince pie before getting land train back to Car park.(it can get a bit cold waiting and whilst on land train, as it's open space and get a bit windy)

There are plenty of disabled parking spaces, there is a chair lift in the house, disabled toilets on ground level and at the Court Yard Cafe


"
2645,Friendly and helpful
2646,It's so great to be able to turn up and get on the tram to any of the stations. The wheelchair space area is marked on the platform so it couldn't be easier. It's a joy to travel on this system. Now there is an under-cover easy change to the train system at Edinburgh Gateway where there is a dry and warm waiting area. 
2647,"All automatic doors access for disabled, but the busy traffic of the site can make it challenging to navigation"
2648,"I didn’t book an accessible room as I wanted a room with a bath so can’t comment on that but the hotel is fully wheelchair accessible with plenty of disabled spaces, easy to get to lifts and large rooms that were easy to get round in my chair. 

The only down sides were that the carpet throughout the hotel was really hard to push myself around on and the step leading down onto the balcony attached to the room. The bathrooms aren’t great the toilet is very low, the sink and taps are hard to reach and the bath is impossible to get out of alone. 

I used the Spa facilities whilst I was at the hotel and the swimming pool was easy for me to get in and out of as they have steps leading into the pool and the side of the small hypotheapy pool. The swimming pool has an accessible changing room (they do keep this locked thought so did have to ask to use it)."
2649,There are a couple of accessible toilets. Once is small and compact and the other is a beautifully spacious room with enough space for a party! The larger accessible loo wins every time as there's so much turning space and plenty of room if you need a carer or PA to help. 
2650,They made the visit good as they were willing to show products to customers as they recognised there was a difficulty in accessing stalls.
2651,"The loo I used was close to my seating area. It was radar key operated.  It was basic in terms of decor but well equipped, it was unisex."
2652,I never though I'd be able to take my wheelchair using son ice-skating but I did and we had a brilliant time! Very helpful staff and very accessible site. I can't wait to go back.
2653,"You are able to have the driver drop you off by foyer entrance, and then go and park, or you will have to park yourself and make your way to foyer. Then you will note many steps to get you into hotel, but if you can manage steps with help, then you must not miss visiting this hotel, of which we personally give 5 stars to. If you cannot manage steps, we are pleased to tell you that a ramp is available, and set up for you by staff members, the ramp being the same as you find on railway stations, so a good proper ramp, so make use of this wonderful hotel when you are in the area of Banbury or Stratford APON Avon. Once you are up on reception desk area, then it is nice and flat to get you into the public disabled toilet , (photo provided),  and to the disabled room if staying here, (photos provided for you). There are also seating available on this level by reception desk, so you can sit and relax there as well. (Photo provided). We did not see any lifts, but there may be one available, we forgot to ask."
2654,"Upon entry, there is a automatic door to enter the premises.  Once in the building, to your left, there is a choice of 3 lifts to all floors (wheelchair friendly/spacious). There are multiple members of staff which are friendly and are happy to help on each floor. Within the cinema screens there are seats which are wheelchair friendly (No stairs required) The only issue I found which may cause slight difficulty for a wheelchair user is that ticket and food collection counters are quite raised, however the staff would be happy to help with any difficulties so don't let that put you off. Apart from that, this experience was an enjoyable one. "
2655,"Luxurious cottage high standard finish absolutely beautiful . Stunning views. 
Tranquil surroundings. 
Dream holiday cannot wait to come back. Value for money."
2656,Really helpful and friendly.
2657,The toilets are the front door. They are easy to get into. They smell nice.
2658,"The pub has no parking itself, although it is only a short distance to various city centre car parks and the various bus routes in York."
2659,Has a flat entrance at the right hand side of the building. The main door does have a step at the entrance. The main restaurant area is raised and has about 3 steps up to it making it impossible for wheelchair user to access. However there are a number of tables in the ground floor bar area that we always sit at. Be aware that because this is the bar area it can become busy. We always phone and book to ensure we have seating!
2660,"The inner courtyard and castle are not accessible at all by motorised wheelchairs/scooters because of the damage they could cause - in the extensive (and beautiful) gardens they can be used. Manual wheelchairs can be used in the inner courtyard, which is very small but can not go in the castle. Access to the higher floors is by a challenging stone spiral staircase, although the staff will let those with difficulty descend by the main staircase which is normally out of bounds. Staff are helpful and there are chairs dotted around to take a rest. Good access to shops/cafe and model house display"
2661,"I visited this shop for the first time in years and I am pleased to say that it is much more accessible than it used to be. The shop is accessed via a wide manual door and although it was manageable for my P.A., staff were eager to help.
I was really impressed by the amount of space within the shop and I was able to manoeuvre round the aisles very easily. Everything is on the ground floor. "
2662,"Accessibility for the Ability Fest event was excellent. Right down to the signing of the speeches, live text display of the speakers presentations, good wheelchair access, and plenty of help on hand."
2663,"They share toilets with the adjoining hotel, which did have disabled toilets, we were given a key card in order to open the door. However, the hotel was accessed by the restaurant through the raised seating area on the left. If a wheelchair user had wanted to use them, they would need to leave the restaurant and enter via the hotel entrance, which I would assume is wheelchair accessible, but I didn't double check."
2664,There was an accessible toilet near the bar area.
2665,"To busy to be helpful, reception staff not at all interested, and waitress staff also quiet busy on our visit, so it’s disappointing."
2666,Very good - and that includes the ensuite ones.
2667,You can get the 25 or X25 bus from Edinburgh City Centre - it takes about 45 mins... There is accessible parking very near entrance of the facility. Be aware the car park can get very busy!
2668,Staff were all friendly and helpful.  Made to feel very welcome.
2669,Very straightforward (see pics)
2670,The village inn is the local village restaurant in Fairlie and is a great place to enjoy fantastic food and a get together with friends and family.
2671,"I went to see Matthew Bourne's amazing ballet, The Red Shoes - as always outstanding. The Theatre Royal in Norwich give disabled people seats in the front row of the stalls - 2 seats so you can easily park your wheelchair and a seat for your companion (free). Disabled parking is just over the road, good sizable disabled loos, good pre performance supper with willing helpers if you need your food and wine transported - What more do you want for a fabulous evening??"
2672,"The Capability Scotland building in Dundee is all level access and has wide enough doors to allow easy access, doors also have darker frames around them to help people with a visual impairment. All rooms I saw are very spacious for numerous wheelchairs and corridors are also wide enough to not cause wheelchair traffic jams. I loved the sensory room were all at a good level for someone in a wheelchair to reach and there is a great tracking hoist if you fancy a comfier seat. 

The only problems that I saw here was that first of all the buzzer to allow you access to the building was too high for anyone in a wheelchair to reach. The exit button was at a good level however there were fire extinguishers which meant that you wouldn't be able to reach if you were in a wheelchair, however even if they weren't there you would still struggle because the doors open out the way and you wouldn't have time to move out of the way before they opened.

Only the door leading to the toilets and doors for the toilets had automatic button, but staff did notice maybe all doors should have automatic button pads."
2673,"Barter Books is one of the largest 2nd hand book shops in Britain, which is located in an old Victorian railway station that has been transformed into a cosy place to browse, read and eat."
2674,"This shop is in the heart of Covent Garden and although buses serve the surrounding area, they will not drop you off nearby. There are no step-free stations nearby. At some point from 2017 you will be able to use the new Tottenham Court Road station, which should be fully step-free."
2675,"Access wasn't brilliant, we came in a side door and while there was a space reserved for us in a raised area, its not just for wheelchair users, so I spent a lot of the night having to ask people to move so my brother could see the gig.  Parking is a challenge and pavements horrendous. Could be great if the access was upgraded generally - felt a bit makeshift. Would be a lot better if there was a dedicated wheelchair user and carers area."
2676,"Xmas shopping, loved the new café which had an accessible counter, and also the accessible payment point at the tills, which save you navigating the queuing system. Easy to get around, plenty of room to navigate a wheelchair between displays"
2677,Good quality food and drink. 
2678,"A visit to the newly refurbished historic jail. There are a number of other different events and tours on offer there too. 
Access has been well thought out. 

A free carer ticket is available with proof of disability.  

There is a show that describes the history of the jail, and you get to see the original cells, Governor’s office with historical artificers, hangman’s noose etc. "
2679,Very wheelchair friendly quality hotel with spacious wheelchair facilities. 
2680,"Bruntsfield is a residential area in the south west of the City adjacent to Napier University, it has a service of six buses one every 4 minutes - 11, 15, 16, 23, 36 and 45. All Edinburgh buses have drop down floors, extended ramps and wheelchair access space, 5 priority seats and easy access button bells for stopping. As with any old City parking is at a premium, there are pay spaces and specific areas for blue badge holders. The nearest bus stop to Seeds for the Soul is northbound 30m towards the City and 50m south boundleaving the City."
2681,"Staff are always very friendly, welcoming and helpful. "
2682,"Facilities are excellent, cannot fault even though this was our second visit and we knew what to expect this time. Felicity and David most welcoming. Longer visit and explored surrounding area with Tissington village a highlight
"
2683,"The toilets are through a door which pushes im so then pulls to go back out, it was very difficult for me to open it due to the handle in particular. The accessible toilet was very clean and a good size, there was a stool in the corner which is good for parents who may need to sit while changing a baby, but it made it a little harder to turn round- though not impossible. There were a good number of grab rails and a red cord that hung to the floor"
2684,"We booked a table in advance, enjoyed  our  afternoon tea,(which was served at the table) price  is very reasonable. There is a Café you can purchase various food and reasonably priced too.  The Staff are all volunteers and were very helpful, making sure we found our table and topping up our tea pots.  Whilst enjoying our afternoon tea, we were able to listen to the music being played on the Wurlitzer and watching couples dancing, putting our Guest in the mod to hit the dance floor. This was a great experience for one couple who had not danced in years, a great experience for someone living with dementia, a great talking point afterwards. Staff did not hurry us and we were able to come back to our table after   having   a look around the Museum and Fairground, ( there is a small charge for Museum but Carers go Free)"
2685,The ramp from the car park was a bit of challenge is places with various lips and bumps.  Only the second floor is accessible by ramp.
2686,"A great place to stop for a bite to eat or coffee on the A9 north.  Even in the very well stocked food store the aisles are wide enough to negotiate as a wheelchair user. The only let down is that the disabled toilet is also a baby change so is a bit cramped, and gets busy."
2687,"The main entrance is up 3 steps And if I was on my own, there was not always staff at the door to get me in, although most people are very helpful and will alert a member of staff. 
The wheelchair entrance is through a side door where there's access to a platform lift. Unfortunately when I was there it was broken so was taken to the main entrance and had to go up quite a steep ramp. Coming back out I had to go backwards. Once in there is a ramp that takes you to the bar area and in the foyer there was a small lift to take me to the theatre which was operated by staff as it needed a key."
2688,Very friendly group leader and volunteers. Open and welcoming atmosphere. 
2689,"No parking outside theatre (bar taxi drop off point), however parking is available further up street (towards Bruntsfield) through blue badge."
2690,Plenty of free parking with disabled spaces short distance from the entrance.
2691,Parking at the front of the Hoteloverlooking the Sea
2692,The staff are lovely and helpful but not really very up to date of with the requirements of disabled people but they do their level best.
2693,Have visited this cinema with my husband who is in wheelchair many many times.   Lovely Art Deco Independant cinema.    We always meet with friendly helpful staff who are more than happy to help.   We particularly like the live digitally broadcast theatre and opera productions .
2694,The access everywhere is brilliant. I used a mobility scooter but my electric wheelchair would have coped fine. They have manual wheelchairs and mobility scooters available.
2695,"from the car, ramp and steps up to front door ,door had level entrance and was wide"
2696,No wheelchair access (down a few steps at SE corner of building). Could be a problem if you are there for a service or concert which lasts for some time. I don't know of any wheelchair-accessible toilets in the vicinity.
2697,"Few Blue Badge parking spots, with ramped kerb (but it was on a bit of a slope so I needed my carers help to push me).
Staff where very friendly and helpful.
Few free from options in the café and the food tasted lovely - I would return.
Plenty of seating options in the café and we could find a space for my wheelchair to sit at a table.
As well as the café and garden centre there's also a place that sells gifts and bits and bobs, but the aisles and displays left little room for me to get my wheelchair round and me and my carer really struggled to navigate around and there where some places even my narrow wheelchair couldn't get through. (I have contacted the to make them aware of this.)
Accessible loo and the red cord was hanging freely (yay!) and left a Red Cord Card."
2698,Staff were really friendly and helpful.
2699,"Many people will likely be on their holidays and staying in a nearby hotel, so may not  require transport. 

There are several small car parks in Last Americas each of which have several marked disabled spaces. In general, I noticed there are a few disabled parking bays on most of the main/bigger streets, including on the Golden Mile.

The local buses (green ones) all can lower to allow people on/off easier. They have two sets of doors, one at the front where the driver is, and another in the middle of the bus. The middle set are wider and would provide better access, there are marked disabled spaces within the buses
"
2700,"Very accessible by wheelchair. Friendly, helpful staff."
2701,"Although on the face of  it the White Rose Center is disabled friendly, it is not. It provides the bare minimum required under regulations and the food court is designed in such a way it is impossible to use if you are in a wheelchair.

There is no enforcement of disabled parking spaces so you need to get there early if you want one. Disabled toilets double as baby changing rooms so cross your legs and hope you do not have to wait too long. 

It is when you go to the food court that your problems start. Firstly there are only two small lifts. Expect a wait as families with prams have to use them too. When you finally get up there they have walled in seating sections for each outlet. These are far too small and have lots of tables and chairs crammed in. There is no space to get a wheelchair between them. Rarely any spare tables and chairs anyway. If you do manage to get a free one and get everyone to move so you can get to it. There is no space to position your wheelchair. Avoid"
2702,"So helpful and welcoming without being intrusive. Went to fetch menu, moved chairs for me, etc. really made me feel welcome."
2703,"Friendly, helpful and went above and beyond  to make me feel safe and reassured."
2704,"The entrance to the main exhibition hall from the main gate is level and the main hall has plenty of space to roam the exhibitions and there is no problems manoeuvring around the displays. There is a lift enabling access to the upper floor where you can overlook the exhibition hall giving you a better idea of the scale of things. The upper floor is also where the temporary exhibitions are for events and there is also a viewing pod for you to look out over the park.
The tram that runs from the entrance of the park to the cottages and sweet shop is equipped with a tail lift enabling wheelchair access. Once at the cottages some of the paths can be quite narrow particularly where the anderson shelter is. The cottages that display the homelife of families from 1840 to 1980 and the old traditional sweet shop all have a few steps to get inside but the staff in the sweet shop will happily assist with a ramp if wheelchair access is required. 
There is a reasonably steep slope down to the canal which might not be appropriate for everyone but once down you have access to along the canal and the Vulcan canal boat is fully accessible by wheelchair."
2705,The building was like an old church hall but it was reasonably accessible; it was easier to enter via the front entrance with a one inch step rather than the ramped entrance which had a very tight turn.  The front entrance was manageable and the staff were very helpful and ensured I was happy with my view etc.
2706,"All level access into station, automatic at both entrance and exit. Lift down on to platform which is massive so lots of people could fit in at one time with luggage, wheelchairs etc. (see image below). Very hard to get an image of the lift though, photo doesn't do it justice. 

Area to book train tickets is very spacious and has a heigh adjustable desk for people in wheelchairs to be able to reach and speak to staff without having to strain themselves. Walking stick holder and adjustable hearing setting available to. If a lot going on in train station even I can struggle sometime to hear the staff member as they sit behind a glass window. 

Lift also has alarm button lower down which I presume is if someone falls in the lift. This is a really good idea and I noticed Edinburgh Waverley also had this. "
2707,"I have now made 3 visits to this Branch which has installed the Welcome App and have moved bank accounts to RBS as a result since my previous Bank did not have this facility and I am unable to queue, I no longer have to since requirements are known and help is given."
2708,"Although the restaurant was very busy, service was friendly and very efficient. All the staff spoke English. There was waiter service and this was very good."
2709,"There is a section of even ground, which will allow anyone with a wheelchair to access the shopping centre in which this cafe is. Then when inside the building costa is located on the ground floor, again enabling easy access. Outside costa, there are additional seats with plenty room for additional equipment. The only negative we could see was tables inside being rather close together, however this could be overcome by sitting outside."
2710,They are all very helpful and willing to assist you with anything that you need.
2711,They had some accessible portaloos near the main stage and accessible campsite but they weren't really advertised. 
2712,"Easy to find free blue badge parking with very helpful parking attendant. Lovely grounds but mostly gravel so very difficult to traverse unless you are in a power wheelchair, Did not go into the palace on this visit but enjoyed gardens, river views and restaurant for lunch."
2713,Multi-storey car park so protected from the weather.
2714,"This hotel says the blueprint for excellent customer service. Easy access with automatic doors, met at  door and then guided to where my friend was, table to low for me  so quickly changed. Staff very attentive and super friendly. Spacious clean and all bases covered toilet. LOVED this place"
2715,"My wife and I have been to the Manchester Arena multiple times and are normally accommodated in  accessibility section of Block 105 which is great as it it is tiered into 2 section with a front row for those with are ambulant of have hidden disabilities  (as you have to walk down a step which isn't too steep) and a section for wheelchairs and their companion on the row behind all of which offer a great view of the stage.

However, when we went to see Shinedown & Alter Bridge we were in Block 109 within the accessibility section. Having not sat in this section before we assumed that the set up would be similar to our previous experiences. How wrong we were. When we arrived we noticed it was one long section with no permanent seats which meant as a result the event staff had to bring out fold down chairs for those who required them. The section was packed with a variety of different sized wheelchairs along with their companions. Their was very little space for a wheelchair user to manoeuvre out of their spot easily without having to ask the 3 people either side to move over. We were placed with very little room to move and I started to feel claustrophobic immediately. We asked the event staff if there was anywhere else we could move, She eventually pointed us a small raised area behind where we were sat that was more suitable to my needs and this is where we watch the show from. The only other problem with this seating arrangement is you feel miles away from the stage so didn't necessarily feel part of the action 

Having been to the fantastic First Direct Arena in Leeds, I found the disabled view spot to be old and dated. Leeds has a singled level accessibility seating that runs the whole length of the arena. Whilst there is not permanent seating in these seating areas, they number the spaces within each section which gives you more space and do no feel like you are sat on top of each other."
2716,Friendly obliging staff
2717,Don't go unless you have good neck muscles
2718,Seescape staff are all extremely helpful and knowledgeable. 
2719,"Good sized disabled loo with grab rail, clean and accessible "
2720,"Better loos are found in the basement. Use the lift from the mound entrance or enter via the gardens entrance (less immediately accessible from street level). Two large disabled loos are on the right after exiting the lift, or through the cafe and to the left from the gardens entrance."
2721,A lot of disabled parking which bring you out into on of the small shopping precincts. This is at the top the hill. Can't comment on the park and ride system.
2722,Level access. Standard width doors. Knock on the window and someone will open for you. Chairs and tables flexible inside. Staff will move to accommodate you 
2723,All very friendly and willing to support you
2724,There is outdoor and indooor seating. There was single step into the restaurant. There were free standing tables and chairs.
2725,Available but not directly outside or anywhere near enough the entrance! It's located in a near by Private multi-storey parking and by an extra charge of £7 /24h
2726,"Access to the seats is pretty bad for those in chairs or  unsteady on their feet, with uneven  ground the main obstacle."
2727,"Bit difficult getting into the entrance, but doable with a bit of effort."
2728,"Generally good access round the garden centre inside and out, although the concession areas (Edinburgh Woollen Mill etc) need to give more thought to how they lay out displays so that wheelchairs have easy access - we gave up with those areas. However, the parts controlled by Dobbies have good access even to our big chair."
2729,"Disabled Access is excellent and all on one level. Signage is good, and there is a ramp if steps are nearby. There is no lift.  There are a few seats in the garden centre but plenty of seats around the cafe area."
2730,"Holkham Hall is made up of the Hall plus its grounds,cafe and shop. You can have a great time doing either or both! There is a lot of renovation work going on at the moment and all the temporary structures that have been put up for cafe & shop were solid and wheelchair accessible. One thing definitely to note is the stairs at the entrance for the main hall. There are about 10 steps that need to be navigated before you can look around the house. They do have rather an ingenious 'stairclimber' machine that either you can transfer to or it can be attached to many other manual wheelchairs - however it's not suitable for powerchairs and it might not be suitable for all manual wheelchair users. They do also have a 'spare' manual wheelchair that they let people borrow. Apart from this the rest of the tour round the house is step free."
2731,No Problems at all
2732,"on booking tickets we was told to be at the venue for 6 pm for the show at 730pm on arival they didnt open until 610pm you couldnt go into the auditorium we was left standing at the disabled accses after some time my carer went and spoke with a supervisor, how then told us he would get me a chair he then came back to me saying he couldn't in this bar as it was a fire exit, he said he could in the lobby, i declined, after a few minuites he came basck and told us there was a delay in the performance could he get us a chair in the foyer i accepted he then said sorry its to busy in there, so he sat me in a draughty door way facing some stairs going down and Infront of a fire extinguisher, people pushing past all the time the show  didn't start until 805pm he came to us and said i may be able to get you in early that never happend, where we was stood they had put another disabled person in a wheel chair, he did say you would have been better where you was, eventually we did get into the auditorium at the interval i went to go to the disabled toilet and guess what there was a que of abled bodied women at the disabled toilet when i told them i was disabled and i needed the toilet they told me to wait in the que i didnt bother i have made a complaint to the venue  stating why havent they got a radar key on the disabled tioilet which would stop abled boided people using this toilet they told me they had sorted this out but i revisited this week and low and behold thevery same problem and the supervisor was stood there waiting with a disabled person whilst a able bodied lady came out of that disabled toilet, no radar key on it, very poor i have been going here for many years as an abled bodied person, but when i became disabled i see things slightly different know we shouldnt have to wait in a que for a toilet that is clearly marked as disabled very poor   "
2733,"Everyone was really happy and friendly, the bar staff were friendly probably because very few people where overly merry. The security guards even seemed in a good mood as there was never any trouble."
2734,Great! There is a decent sized accessible loo which was clean and tidy. There was a keypad lock on the door which I presume is locked when the car park gates are locked.
2735,Family Italian restaurant.. Work.night out..Access easy with a bit of good chair manoouvering. Good height table for powerchair..Friendly staff but seemed so.put on.
2736,Not built yet but will be big enoiugh for wheelchair to turn a full circle
2737,We brought the beach wheelchair to our car and transferred there leaving our own chair in the car.
2738,"Although the restaurant didn’t appear to be busy, we seemed to wait quite a while before a member of staff approached us. On the whole we found the meal really enjoyable and it was only tarnished by the slowness of the staff."
2739,Please see in my review
2740,Rooms available with bathrooms adjusted to disabled peoples needs but very small !!!
2741,"All the staff were simply amazing. We were called at home before we travelled to check our dietary requirements. Every member of staff we spoke to was friendly and helpful. The chef made sure we had vegetarian food, even telling us that the trifle would not be suitable because the jelly contained gelatine. My Mum was offered diabetic ice cream because she is following a low sugar diet. "
2742,Clean accessible loo.
2743,"Southpour don't norma!ly take bookings but did when I phoned to explain I was coming down in a wheelchair. Easy access through the main door from the street. Friendly staff on hand to help with the doors. The 'Easy Access ' toilet comes up trumps with plenty of space to get through to it.
The food was superb, clearly care went into the preparation as it both looked and tasted superb.
Great work Southpour, a very enjoyable visit."
2744,has a bus running to it lots of parking and is on the flat so ideal for all abilities and ages
2745,Easy access makes it possible to manoeuvre around though you may have to ask staff to move some of the clutter.
2746,Very good access around the site and on and off the canal longboats
2747,Would rate higher if just looking for mens!
2748,Plenty of parking - several disabled spaces. 
2749,The parking is good as you can park along the street by the thrift shop and near the spa post office. 
2750,"The lady that showed us around was lovely, polite, and had great knowledge of everything."
2751,Each stand has accessible toilets in close proximity to the accessible seating areas.
2752,"If you are using a manual wheelchair, I would seriously think about hiring one of the mobility scooters, even through I thought that they were expensive.

Some of the paths were tarmacked, but on the whole they were gravely.

My wife pushed me for 82 miles in 10 days but this place almost had her beat. "
2753,Level access and automatic doors.  Lift to restaurant takes one wheelchair and carer.  Good space to move around.
2754,"There were plenty of disabled accessible toilets.  They were spacious, with grab rails and emergency alarm.

UPDATED FROM DECEMBER 2018:  On my recent visit the new accessible toilet immediately adjacent to the special assistance seating area is open. The room is spacious, with grab rails and emergency alarm, which didn't reach to the floor. It is a disappointing that when Gatwick Airport put in these excellent new facilities, they didn't create a Changing Places toilet."
2755,"There are 10 disabled parking spaces in the Faskally Wood area where The Enchanted Forest is hosted however, you have to phone the box office to reserve a space when you book your tickets. Due to high demand, availability of a disabled space is sometimes hard to get, once these spaces are gone they are gone.

Unfortunately, there aren’t any other disabled or non-disabled spaces nearby as Faskally Wood is 1.6 miles from Pitlochary. There is however a bus that takes guests to the Enchanted Forest from the Fishers Hotel if you have enough mobility to get on to the bus, this is available to all guests with their Enchanted Forest ticket. There is a voice of The Enchanted Forest story that you listen to whilst on the bus, which isn't available to visitors parking on site. I would maybe suggest finding another way to allow those visitors to listen to it too.

Within Pitlochary there is some on street parking and council parking available in short walking distance from where the bus would pick you up from the Fishers Hotel. If you can’t get on to the bus for the Enchanted Forest and no disabled parking spaces are available then you could possibly get a taxi to Faskally Wood by parking in Pitlochary, but I’m not sure how good the taxi services are. Alternatively, you can get to Pitlochary by bus or train, check your local bus and train station for more information."
2756,"The circus itself is amazing, we went as part of my child’s home education and weren’t expecting it to be as much fun as it was. Absolutely awesome show.

Due to Covid the main entrance is closed, but they have a put a temporary ramp up on the promenade entrance.  It’s a tiny bit tricky, but they will help. As soon as we got in, security diverted us from the queue round to the accessible entrance inside. 

Great view from the accessible area, and it has a lovely dedicated staff member.  Lots of flat space, and chairs available for family/carers so we could sit together (there were just 2 of us though not sure if a whole family can) 

Changing Places Room - a bit of a distance away, but staff will take you (they even moved a huge crowd of people out of the way!) it has a toilet, a mobile manual hoist (Oxford mini) and a full hospital bed. 

We didn’t see them, but there are quite a few ‘standard’ accessible toilets too.  Several people there used scooters and these were stored safely.  

I don’t think there are a lot of wheelchair spaces (to be fair it was built in 1894!) so you need to book in advance. "
2757,No hearing loop or Braille but I bet she'd get them if needed
2758,"the wheelchair ramp is a total waste of time, my powered chair bottomed out on the door threshold, it has a large sudden lump in the middle of the doorway, both my powerchair and manual wheelchair and most chairs i have ever seen would have difficulty, the staff were totally unhelpful and we left as they did not want our custom because we complained about the access "
2759,"From the toilet block, there is a wide, flat path along one side of the dam. It is well accessible with the right chair but it is grass and so quite hard going. I was using my mountain trike and by the time we'd gone there and back, I was quite tired. It was windy though and quite warm, so that didn't help. I would be interested to attempt the full circle some time."
2760,"Lovely gardens, with two cafes and shop, all accessible."
2761,"Accessible toilet immediately beside the lift as you cam into the cafe area. Plenty of room to manoeuvre, adequate grab rails & emergency pull cord."
2762,Steep ramps but everywhere was accessible. 
2763,There are a lot of compromises at this hotel. You access it via the basement which means the security guard letting you in via the deliveries ramp and then getting a lift up. If coming down you stop on the ground floor and need to find a member of staff to use a key to send you lower - fine for us but would be a problem if you were on your own. 
2764,"Access to the site was very good.  Once inside, the ground was a bit rough when going between the areas"
2765,Bus stops nearby. Car parking good.
2766,well signed
2767,"Lifts between card deck, accommodation and restaurants."
2768,Flat ground floor access 
2769,"Wide paths, gentle slopes, you can see everything in the gardens from the paths. Plenty of summer seats scattered around the gardens."
2770,"Access to the venue and to the wheelchair spaces is good although the aisles do slope and require a little care.  excellent view of stage.  Disabled toilets are generally easy to get to, but if the audience is large the foyer can be a bit crowded.  Any deficiencies are more than compensated for by the attention and consideration of the staff."
2771,"I went to The Lodge Forest Visitor Centre for lunch followed by a stroll along the Waterfall Trail and up to the Red Squirrel Hide. I really enjoyed all the sculptures we spotted along the route, like the deer, the female figure and the mirrored silhouettes.
The cafe was spacious with a good selection including pies, baked potatoes and toasties. It is also a good place for watching people on the Go Ape ziplines! "
2772,"The ramp to the front door was good, with automatic doors in the main part of the building. The lift was pretty poor, very small and being used by everyone in the hotel so we had long waits. It didn't reach as far as the leisure complex and there was no other disabled access to the pool and gym. We weren't able to have a swim."
2773,"The gardens are a delight, with wheelchair accessible paths to see all the major iron statues, including the infamous Thinker. The small museum is accessible too and theres a large accessible loo, albeit at the back of a fairly tightly packed shop.  The cafe was accessible for us.
The house was closed for refurbishment when we were there so not sure how accessible it is."
2774,"Free disabled parking outside main entrance.  Stone path allows easy access only disadvantage is the manual doors to manoeuvre!
Once inside everything is flat and a one way system so very easy to navigate.
Receptionist is extremely friendly and explained exhibition and toilet access as well as disabled access to second room.
Fantastic exhibits and good videos to watch for added insight."
2775,"When we arrived we realised my wheels were flat! My friend went in to ask if they had wheelchairs but they didn’t. We back home to get the pump. Back at the venue! 
I had a lovely evening, I was in my manual chair and struggled to move about myself because of the carpets. The staff were friendly, food was good, temperature was on the colder side and the fire wasn’t on but it wasn’t uncomfortable."
2776,"Thank you so much! We’ve just been to Rachel’s to meet up with our son. We all enjoyed our visit and food immensely. Food was delicious and staff were very friendly and helpful. Rachael’s is excellent for those in a wheelchair. Design of restaurant very accessible and table space to manoeuvre very good and staff were very helpful. There is no Accessible Toilet 
Ruth Douglas"
2777,"The parking spaces are small and awkward to get into. They have 3 at entrance. The bays only have 1 side marked. My issue was the only bay had left side marked and bollards. I use a hoist so I need the right side marked as I can only forward in.

For some reason in some parts they have two disabled bays and one regular bay. They'd have been better off making two large disabled bays."
2778,Lovely (if not expensive) food.
2779,There were public loos next to the cafe with a ramp up to them and an accessible loo. It was locked but an attendant appeared with a key before I'd even registered this. All clean inside. 
2780,Disabled car parking at the start of the paths. No public transport. 
2781,"Very friendly, accommodating, and helpful."
2782,"Flanders Moss has a car park with multiple disabled parking bays. The car park does have gravel however this has a net over the top so I found it fairly easy to self propel my wheelchair across this. 
 There is no close public transport to Flanders Moss. The nearest bus stop is about 1.5 miles away in Thornhill.
 "
2783,See pic
2784,"It's a side door, you ting a bell and someone comes a d gets you. You sit right at back next to sound box. No.othwr choice of space or seats back or nothing..Exit door to outside was near us, so quite cold with draft.."
2785,We travelled by private car.  There are some disabled spaces but they are not particularly wide.
2786,No easy parking but buses do go along the High Street.
2787,"Toilet accessibility  is poor as toilets are situated up two flights of stairs, a hand rail is provided. There is no lift access available. Also there are no disabled specific toilets."
2788,"There are two bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms.  Both bedrooms have four beds with own bedside tables and wardrobes.  Bedroom 7 houses a step-in shower that would not be particularly accessible for those with a reduced mobility.  Bedroom 8, however, is much more accessible, with a roll-in shower and several grab rails.  There is a visitor’s cupboard between bedrooms 7 and 8, stocking plastic aprons, rubber gloves, a lockable medicine cabinet, hairdryers, alarms, toilet rolls, towels, cleaning materials and extra bedding."
2789,Basic standard
2790,The accessible toilet had enough space to turn and to have a carer assist you. The grab rails were blue and around the toilet and sink. The toilet was left hand transfer but it may be awkward as they've put the emergency cord in the way. There was a lowered coat hook. Toilet sign was in pictures not words. 
2791,This is a review of the accessible fitness facilities available at Vikingar Largs
2792,There is a disabled toilet but I've never used it I have only been in the general ladies toilet which is quite big.next visit I will check out the disabled toilet and update the review
2793,"The recently renovated Dunalastair (Opened May 2017) looked great.  Felt a little underdressed in my jeans, but hey ho, we'd arrived and Kinloch Rannoch doesn't have many eating place options.

Great level access, lots of parking, uber posh interior and lots of friendly but professional staff all keen to help.

The receptionist walked us to the restaurant, which was down two fairly chunky steps, thought they are well spaced out.  As the parking was so close I'd chosen to just used my crutches this time.

The wheelchair access was via a side door which you had to go outside to get to (I hate that, especially when it's cold and wet), but at least they had an option.  Tables were well spaced out, plenty room to get around without bumping into other diners or knocking anything over.

I took marks off for the mediocre food (defo not as posh as the surroundings) and the complete lack of a wheelchair accessible toilet."
2794,"This is a review of Auschwitz-Birkenau, an extermination camp, which was in operation during World War II. Some people might find the text and photos in this review upsetting. 

Auschwitz is the smaller but better preserved of the two camps. If you can manage the steps, there is lots to see inside the individual buildings. A short ride away is Birkenau which was the larger camp but not so much survives as the Nazis tried to destroy it to hide their atrocities, so a lot it is open ground. Both sites are emotionally and physically demanding to navigate.

I went on a guided tour which was organised by Krakow Direct. However, there are many similar companies which offer similar tours."
2795,"Good parking at the centre
Train station is a bit of a walk but not unmanageable"
2796,"The access is great as there is automatic doors and then a life up to the 2nd floor. Even though the lift was tight for space, at least there was a lift! There was a few disabled toilets on floor 2."
2797,"There are step free and free standing outdoor table and chairs. There is a single step into the parlour. Inside there are 2 counters, both at standing height. One is for take away ice creams. There is also a self service café counter for those who want to eat in. 

The parlour has fixed sofas but free standing tables and chairs. "
2798,"So glad Ruth and Steve had a vision to create this holiday let to be accessible for disabled people as there are so few options for us. This is in the quietest village I have ever known, with a lovely campsite, recreation grounds and the prettiest of gardens and interesting buildings. The award winning landscaped garden at Croft Bungalow is also lovely to be in and observe through the windows, with its fountain, amazing stones, wildlife and fragrant flowers.  The bungalow itself is fully equipped and accessible and the owners even suggest care companies to help with personal care if required. I took my mum who is 96 with Dementia and my husband who Is quadriplegic with MND, and I managed some beautiful walks in the surrounding area without driving anywhere all week 😊😊"
2799,Street parking on double yellows outside (but OK with blue badge). Bit tricky to get onto the pavement.
2800,The step free access is via the Cromwell road entrance and there is a large button to press to gain access via a glass door in between the two revolving doors. Plenty of information on the website. You can also book a guide and a wheelchair in advance to help you.
2801,"Accessible, very good, rails, height, non slip floor etc."
2802,"Although the club has a lift to take you from the parking to the reception it is, what I would describe, a workers lift so not ideal however functionally speaking is fine"
2803,The toilet was a distance from the show and required going through very busy crowds which was difficult for me.
2804,Great. Level access to enter. 
2805,"An easily accessible ice-cream parlour specialising in ice-cream, waffles & crepes. A must visit place for any ice-cream lover!"
2806,"There were 2 accessible toilets, one on the top deck and one by the cafe on the ground floor. The toilets were spacious with grab rails and emergency cord."
2807,Very welcoming 
2808,"Over the years I have visited La Cala De Mijas many times, which is in the Costa Del Sol, Spain.  In the past it has not been the most accessible place, however, the community and local committee have been working to change that. They have taken up all of the public paths and replaced them, making them wider and ensuring they are all level and accessible for wheelchairs, which makes getting around the town a lot easier. Furthermore, they have put boardwalks all along the beach so people who may have mobility difficulties are able to access the beach and sea, with regular monitoring from lifeguards. At the Lifeguard station they have made accessible sun-loungers on a level access floor on the beach and have also provided wheelchairs and walking sticks that can be used on the sand and in the sea to make access into the water easier for everyone. they have also included a disabled friendly outside shower on the beach, and this is based near a disabled toilet. The Lifeguards are always willing to help and are very friendly and regularly patrol the whole of the beach. All of the public transport is very cheap and accessible for wheelchair users.  This is a great holiday destination for families to visit as they are constantly looking at new ways to improve their facilities."
2809,"The member of staff was friendly and welcoming. However, I only saw them when I bought my ticket and returned my golf club at the end. There was no member of staff on the golf course. However, based on my welcome when I arrvied I felt I could have approached the member of staff if I had needed help."
2810,"Our first visit here recently was to see Weezer.
Upon arrival we were greeted by a member of staff who explained the procedure for entry and collecting our tickets from the box office. 
After a cursory search by security we collected our tickets and were escorted to the disabled area, with is to left side of the auditorium and at a height that afforded a clear view of the stage. The disabled area measured about 25ft x 10ft and is at a right angle to the stage, with no fixed seating. We were first in so had the pick of where to pitch ourselves; we took up a position about forty to fifty feet from the stage.

Throughout the concert we had an excellent and uninterrupted view of the stage.  There were two members of staff in the disabled area looking after us and preventing interlopers from gaining access.

There were two bars in the auditorium, one quite close to us that a wheelchair user could probably get to, perhaps with assistance from a member of staff. I didn't notice a lowered counter at the bar though, nor was a 'drinks to your seat' service offered.

At the end of the concert it was perhaps a good ten minutes before the auditorium cleared and we were able to make our way to the exit. The staff were ready with the ramp; just make sure you go down backwards, unless you are not bothered about your footrests and feet.
"
2811,I didn't use the accessible toilets but noticed them on all levels I visited very close to the large modern lift.
2812,"Access extends beyond ramps and toilet facilities to the very real practicalities of getting people with a variety of needs onto boats. A lot of thought has been given to this; Sea Rover is a motorboat with a drop ramp to allow wheel chairs to wheel aboard and anchors to fix the chair, there are hoists to lower those with mobility problems into sail boats and volunteers trained in lifting and handling.
Most important is the mindset of the volunteers, there nothing which is too much trouble."
2813,A good-sized disabled toilet is on the ground floor.
2814,Toilet is accessed using a radar key and is combined with baby changing facilities. There is limited turning space. The cord was tied up so I had to untie it. There were bars around the toilet but not around sink or on door. The flush handle wasn't adapted. Toilet is left sided transfer but you'd have to remove the bin. 
2815,"The accessible loo is on the lower floor adjacent to the cafe / restaurant. A lift connects the floor and is of the deep and slim variety. The loo is clean, tidy and well lit. It has a Male space for most wheelchair users but may be a little tight for large power chairs. "
2816,"Accessible Samurai Escape Room
WE HAD THE BEST TIME! Booked this for a friend's birthday and we did the ""birthday"" package - including cake and a drink after your hour in the escape room. 

Among us there was someone using a wheelchair, someone using crutches and someone who is visually impaired, and we all were able to take part and enjoy the game. 
They have an accessible toilet and step free access, and would most certainly recommend this game to other disabled people and their friends/families.

Connor was a fantastic games master and thoughtfully made minor alterations to the game room to meet our access needs. 

We all can't wait to come back and do the rest of the rooms, and have already told others to come have a go. 

Incredibly friendly staff and a fantastic experience."
2817,"You couldn't ask for nicer staff, friendly and polite."
2818,"Flat accessible entrance, but a narrow-ish doorway so you might struggle with a powerchair. For reference, my wheelchair frame width is 48cm/18.9” (excluding the wheels) wide and it fit but just about. Also a heads up, no motorised doors. Tight inside when it’s busy as it’s a popular pub, but there’s room to manoeuvre and flat access around."
2819,"A gastro pub with a big beer garden out the back, so good in the summer. There is an accessible entrance but you'll have to find some way of alerting the staff to open it when it's cold and the back gate to the beer garden is closed. There are not many accessible pubs in Oxford, so it is worth mentioning. It is nice inside with some inaccessible bits if you are a wheelchair user. Food is nice but I have waited a long time in the past. The bar and restaurant are wheelchair accessible."
2820,No steps wide doors helpful owner   
2821,"This Holiday Inn has a single manual door for wheelchair access to the right of their revolving doors. This door isn't very heavy.
The reception desk is very high, making it hard to interact with staff at times.
The lift is very slow & small, but does the job.
The corridors have thick carpets & are narrow with tight corners, but I could still move around in my powered wheelchair without too much difficulty.
The accessible room we were assigned was excellent. There was a wheelchair-level peephole in the main door, a spacious wet room with sturdy grab rails & an emergency pull cord that reached the floor, & plenty of room to manoeuvre around the room. The emergency cord in the bedroom was tucked behind the radiator. It's also the only hotel I've stayed in where the disabled room had a proper double-bed rather than two singles, because contrary to popular opinion, disabled people can actually have relationships.
The staff were friendly & accommodating, everything was clean, & the location was excellent. We were very close to the city centre & didn't need to rely on public transport during our stay, although there were plenty of bus stops if necessary. "
2822,Only one hand rail.
2823,Staff are always welcoming and accommodate individual accessibility needs. They move chairs and provide assistance where necessary.
2824,"Car park just across the road with a walkway and lift. Flat entrance into hydro, lift to floor with accessible seats. Good view from accessible seating, although this might be different if at a concert with the people in front standing."
2825,Hosts could not have been more helpful
2826,Level threshold access.  Lobby entrance may be a challenge for scooters but fine for wheelchair/powerchair.
2827,The scooter was outside ready for us. The cafe has ramped access with rails
2828,Normal accessible disabled loo with usual facilities and plenty of space for carer if required. Not sure about adult changing facilities. Could have been cleaner but not offensive.
2829,The staff are very helpful and cheerful. 
2830,Several dedicated disabled parking spaces. Good public transport links to the village.
2831,"Directly outside are 2 parking spots
Across the road there are 10
20 yards and there are 6 spaces 2 disabled"
2832,"There were lifts. Getting down to the NEC i was directed to an extremely bumpy weirdly cobbled path that my manual wheelchair would not have got down without the wheels getting stuck constantly, it was pretty unpleasant in my power chair. The next day I asked if there was any other way and was told there was! I could go out through the fire doors in the restaurant! This was much better, however I couldn’t get back in this way so had to take the bumpy path that goes uphill again. "
2833,"By car.  Had to drive all the way past disabled parking, then through all the other car parks back the way we had already been to get to disabled car park (could have opened a gate for access.  Paid £25 per day"
2834,"Blue badge parking 150 yards from the house, there is a parking attendant directing cars to appropriate spaces when you show your Blue badge. There were plenty of spaces but it was October and so not busy."
2835,"Bus route into town with stop nearby, on street (free) parking to front, small car park to rear (no disabled spaces though) "
2836,This would be excellent if there was a way to make the front doors accessible without getting them unlocked!
2837,Great access throughout the building as there are not only stairs to access both levels but there are also lifts and escalators at both ends of the shopping centre. There is a wide accessible walking space to get around between the shops.
2838,staff were friendly and helpful
2839,One of the largest dedicated Blue Badge car parks I've seen in a long time. Plenty of space to transfer from the car to the wheelchair.  The parking bays are are about 100m from the main entrance. The signposting from the main road was not as clear as it couldh've been. We drove to the wrong entrance before finding out way to the accessible parking. Not too sure about public transport but there were buses running along the nearby main road.
2840,Lots of room for wheelchair Accessible Vehicles (WAV) but Hi-top vehicles need to phone ahead to get the barrier lifter to get into carpark
2841,Took 34 bus from home near Slateford Road to Princes Street opposite Castle then trundled up Castle Street to cruise George Street to Charlotte Square... Bus driver very helpful...
2842,"We stayed in Little Bench for the first time in early September.  The cottage was comfortable, lovely and clean and most importantly entirely suitable for my husband who uses a powerchair. 
Wide doorways, hoists and big wet room.  The owners were lovely people who were always willing to suggest places to visit.  A great base to visit the lovely area."
2843,They have a wheelchair bathroom at the back of the bar (next to the board game table). It requires a reverse job in as the door opens inwards but it is big.
2844,"The toilet was good, with one omission, the door open inwards, which would prove a problem for a larger wheelchair."
2845,"There is parking nearby in the Holyrood Park car park, and also at Duddingston Kirk. There was no nearby public transport."
2846,"We did not notice any disabled parking spots on this visit, but will look next time and update here. 
 The number 45 bus from Newcastle Haymarket bus station comes closest."
2847,Very spacious disabled toilet and also a changing places space.
2848,"Level access. The front door is not automatic but is not a heavy fire door. Counter was high for myself (wheelchair user) but staff are happy to move card machine down / help in any way. There are tall stools along the window, basic chairs and round tables, and comfier sofa-like chairs and low tables. The space where people queue is also the way to go to disabled toilet so can be tricky if it gets busy."
2849,Smooth entrance in but then you may find it difficult to move as there is sofas in the way but the staff will offer to move them for you.
2850,Good.
2851,The staff were all very helpful.
2852,staff kept us advised when a table would become available. they also moved a chair for me. service was friendly and attentive.
2853,Staff are all very friendly and are willing to help with anything that may be needed.
2854,"A beautiful Narrow Boat for disabled accessible holiday. Ramp access to the boat with Hydraulic Lift to assist disabled person or wheelchair to the topside to tiller or bunks and kitchen below. Accessible shower and toilet and one cubicle toilet. Electric wheelchairs can only be charged while boat is charging, so better if manual wheelchair. We took a scooter and electric wheelchair, and charged during day. Sleeps 8"
2855,"Nothing was to much trouble, Gave details to local shops/beaches and places of interest."
2856,"Waterfront ground floor property which is fully accessible with wet floor shower ,garden and parking. Ideal for fishing ,sailing etc"
2857,Used as a storage facility 
2858,A marked space around the corner at the end of the street
2859,"It lived up to its tremendous reputation for food, service and luxury."
2860,"There is a changing places toilet at the entrance, which had everything you need as well as a clos-o-mat toilet - amazing. There is also an accessible toilet upstairs next to the restaurant and one at the exit. "
2861,"Having a walk in shower made it accessible for me, there was a lift. The step up to the bathroom made it less accessible and I'm 6ft and I even found the bed very high. It made it difficult to get dress in the morning."
2862,Peter the volunteer who drove the mobility vehicle was very helpful and friendly.
2863,"lovely helpful, understanding people "
2864,"Good jolly staff, sufficiently attentive. "
2865,Didn't use toilet facilities so couldn't comment.
2866,Great little shop with friendly staff.
2867,"The accessible toilets are not on all floors. I used the accessible toilet on the lower ground floor. There is step free access to it by lift and it was close to the café. 

I also used the accessible toilet on the 4th floor where the restaurant is.

Both toilets were clean and spacious. There were grab rails and the emergency cord reached towards the floor. The 4th floor accessible toilet also had their own red cord card, see photo. It was lying on shelf when I arrived and I re-attached it to the cord."
2868,Good disabled toilet but can be difficult to get to when the restaurant is busy.
2869,"Everyone was extremely accommodating and willing to help us in any way they could. Everyone always offered a service with a smile, which always makes a difference!"
2870,There is a disabled toilet at Colyton station and a toilet at Seaton station
2871,"The Regal Lady is a former World War II steamship, refitted for leisure cruises around Scarborough's North and South Bays. As expected, access can be tricky on this vessel, due to its age and original purpose. Our visit included a Guide Dog, and the staff were very helpful, assisting my blind mother down the narrow walkway onto the boat, taking the guide dog and making her aware of her surroundings."
2872,Close to Derby bus station.
2873,"Thank goodness for satnav, not obvious to find.  The main parking area would be very difficult for wheelchair users or those with limited walking mobility, due to being a gravely surface.  We asked parking attendant if disabled parking, he pointed across the road.

 We parked outside the ""restaurant"" which had one disabled space we could see, and room for quite a few cars.  Restaurant sounds grander than it is.  Along the path is another shack that was the monkey cafe, at first glance it looks to only have steps in, but has a ramp to the right of that door. Its choices were really basic, and moving space very limited, but it filled a hole! The little monkeys in the small enclosure outside are entertaining whilst having lunch out, (on a nice enough day). 

We had a young lad keen to go see the animals, and headed for the entrance. A 4yr old, 1 adult wheelchair user, 2 adults (1 being my privately employed PA). I was really disappointed to find that they didn't offer complimentary 'assistants entry, or at very least significantly reduced. They stated there policy is only those with carers photo id, could be admitted, so with making my displeasure clear I paid the entrance fees. 

I have employed PA's for 20+ years, and this is not something I have heard of before. I suggested she meant my CEA card, but no,  ""official like in a nursing home id for the carer to show-with a photo"". I totally understand they need to make money, but unfortunately I am really put off by this, as it doubles the cost for me to have a day out and join my friends. I can't go without an assistant. 

The terrain was ok for me, a bit bumpy at times, but manageable with my electric wheelchair. I have poor balance so I chose my paths quite carefully. I was encouraged into puddles by my young friend, as I am assured splashing is fun!

The accessible loo I was in, was near the play park, it was also a baby change area. 

The highlight for me was seeing the rescued  bears in the pond, and the monkeys, oh and the meerkats feeding. It was a good day out, not too big a place to go around, and had a play park for kids to have some fun..the £1 a go- karts were my little friends highlight. There was also an indoor play area, which we didn't use as it was a lovely day outside. 

I would like to go back, but would need to weigh it up against travel/entrance cost of something else. 

"
2874,"Easy to move my wheelchair around in. Chair and tables not to close together.
Small selection of gluten free and vegan (dairy free) food.
Different milk alternatives including soya (free) and oat milk (40p).
Good selection of food and drinks.
The till and food fridge wasn't at an accessible hight.
The drink I has tasted nice.
The man that served me was a bit grumpy but he obliged when I asked him to check the dietary book. I also carry a medical dietary requirements card which I showed him.
The lady that mad my drink was friendly and carried my drink to the table for me.
The also have plastic straws which is helpful for me as the cups are too heavy for me to pick up.
The entrance doors are hard to open if you're in a wheelchair, my friend had to get them for me.
It's a nice temperature in there, not too hot or cold."
2875,A gold star to all concerned.
2876,"Easy access trail approx 1k, most suited to powered chairs/scooter due to inclines and pressed gravel service. Zig-zag paved path from car park to visitor centre. Paved level access around centre/cafe/toilets."
2877,"Best sushi in Edinburgh, for sure. But not very accessible."
2878,"Level access, automatic doors, ramps and slopes."
2879,"We drove there , the range is off the beaten track a few miles out of Fort Wiiliam.
Plenty of dedicated accessible parking near the entrance, a lot of the parking is on gravel surface , but there are spaces with tarmac/ paving at side.
parking is charged at £3 per day"
2880,The staff members are helpful in answering  questions and can make special arrangements in advance.
2881,"On arrival I went to pay.  The staff were very helpful & the carer for a  disabled visitor is free.  
I was given the map & day planner & inside the visitor centre I bombarded the  staff with lots of questions about birds!  She was really patient, helpful & knowledgeable.
On my tour I found more helpful & knowledgeable staff & I learnt a lot."
2882,Grassmarket parking available but there is still quite a walk to the entrance. There a some bus stops reasonably close.
2883,"Disabled toilets should be nearby in pretty much every region of the union, and are kept clean. Given that they serve as gender neutral facilities, there can be a wait to access the toilet. Not every disabled toilet has full-changing facilities, but there is at least one that does (it may be best to ask staff about this)."
2884,Visited Rip It Up at NHM. Was able to park at disabled spot at Tower Restaurant but disabled parking is s limited. There is a walk to the  main entrance where there is a lift. I do not use a wheelchair but a walking stick. All the entrances appear to be wheelchair accessible. A good idea are fold up chairs which you can carry or use as a walking assistant so you can sit down anywhere when you feel tired. This made the exhibit easy to navigate plus there was some seating. Very good disabled toilets with very unusually sanitary dispensers. There are lifts but they are very busy
2885,The staff were very professional and helpful. 
2886,"The nearest parking would be available at the Hounds Hill shopping centre around 10mins away I did not visit the parking area during this visit.
The tram stop is just across the road from the tower as is local bus services as well"
2887,There is a shuttle bus running from carpark to house which is a 5 min walk. Disability parking at the house
2888,"The pub has two main entrances - the main door facing the bar has a small step, however the door facing the Minster is fully accessible.  There is a lot of furniture in the pub which can make it difficult to manoeuvre a wheelchair in busier periods."
2889,"The staff were all lovely! So helpful and polite! Particularly one lady called Verity - she went the extra mile or two to ensure my allergies were catered for and that I could have the pie of my choice. We were expecting our meal to be delivered take away style, in boxes but it was all plated up really nicely. "
2890,Flat access making it easy to enter for people in wheelchairs and vision impairments. The staff were really friendly and ensured we were happy and had everything required. The food was very nice with many of us stating we would definitely return again to eat their. The toilets were well signed and well located within the pub. 
2891,There was an accessible loo but I didn't use / need it so cannot provide any helpful comment on this.
2892,"On arrival  at the castle  with a fractured ankle, i had to walk or say limp on crutches down hill to the information and ticket point  desperate  for a toilet, to be met by a Scottish lady to be told that the cafe and toilets could only be used by prople who bought a ticket to see the castle,  the tickets being £12 per person. It was obvious to her i was never going to be able to walk around the castle,  so basically its £12 for  wee pee? I was disgusted at their hospitality on being told if i needed a toilet there was one two miles up the road where we had just passed.  I decided to carry on and found a lovely pub further on  whos hospitality was wonderful,  needless to say we pressed on to Eilean Doran castle  instead which was more beautiful,  toilets and cafe are free and viewing the castle only £10.  Shame on the staff that fail to help their custoners at Urquhart  castle."
2893,"I was very interested that Kew Garden was famous, beautiful, calm and the popular of garden in the world. Staff talked about history, story ""Royal family"", trees and flowers. It was amazing and the oldest in garden. Gallery was so lovely arts and different flowers and trees from World! 
British Sign Language has interpreter and also staff that Interpreter was fantastic and fun and staff was very nice, friendly and fun. 
There are different cafes and restaurant are some cheap and nice places. 
I will be come back again!!! ;)"
2894,"The wheelchair area offers a great view of the stage. BUT the venue have crammed four wheelchair spaces into the allocated space and companions have to sit behind the wheelchair users crammed against the wall. As previous reviewers stated, this means if one person wants out, everyone else has to move out of the way. This is neither good for accessibility not inclusiveness. Shame on the venue for cramming in too many."
2895,Disabled toilets on all three floors.
2896,"  The disabled toilet is on the ground floor  and wheelchair  accessible.
See photo "
2897,We did drive and parked on nearby street using blue badge on yellow line
2898,"Basically, five star! Clean, red cords as they should be and a Changing Places. One thing I really liked was the accessible toilets weren't shared as baby changing, so no queues of riotous kids. Only thing I did find was one or two doors open outwards in to pretty crowded corridors, but a minor detail really!"
2899,"Flat, level access tarmac car park where you can park right outside your cottage. Lots of room and is private with no public access."
2900,Parking in The Kingsgate multi story. Prices have been slashed so don't be afraid to use it. Shopmobility on lower ground. Phone ahead and they will meet you with a scooter 01383 661455
2901,"Step free access, if booked booked throuh dmt accessibility line. "
2902,"I've always wanted to climb Ben Nevis, so in a wheelchair, this was the next best thing. Various activities on site, but we went to go up Aonach Mór in Britain's only Mountain Gondola.Fantastic experience,very accessible, would highly recommend a visit."
2903,Calvert trust Exmoor is one of the most accessible places I have ever been. I had a full weekend of outdoor adventure in a beautiful setting surrounded by the most helpful people and fully accessible. It really is an amazing place
2904,The venue of this Starbucks branch is very accessible and is convienantly located within the city centre 
2905,"Easily accessible building & facilities. 
Although the concert area is all standing, as I had pre-booked my visit with them, space was made available for my wheelchair, with a seat for my son, at the side of the stage!!
All of the staff, and in particular, the show's security staff, pulled out all the stops to make my night, a night to remember!!!"
2906,"A gorgeous restaurant over looking fields and trees, with high quality food and excellent service. A wonderful menu with many seasonal delights. Stocking local produce including seaweed gin, a personal favourite of mine. A wonderful relaxing dining experience. My only negative for the place is the slope to the restaurant. The carpet is very thick and the little wheels of my manual chair came across and obstacle under the carpet. It took my husband pushing to help navigate the slope back up."
2907,"This is a village garden centre, cafe and gift shop, who’s staff are so helpful and friendly but sadly their accessibility is poor. They are however trying to improve as their 1 blue badge parking spot has now doubled and both have been recently painted to clearly identify them as accessible parking spaces."
2908,"There is a disabled toilet on close by to the parking, accessible by a Radar Key, although admittedly I have not use them.  The beach wheelchair volunteer will have a radar key if you don’t have your own."
2909,Accessible from the street by ramp and the parts I visited inside were fully accessible.
2910,Great loo.  BUT it was used by everyone else and a table was of course right outside it meaning they had to move chairs so my wheelchair could get through!
2911,"This city can be accessed by train and by transit buses.  There are also taxi companies who can accommodate all needs.  There are also various accessible parking options within the city.  On Market days, it can get a bit crowded, so be sure to arrive before 10.  The company Accessible Travel Netherlands can assist with transportation and lodging arrangements."
2912,Parking on the flat next to the entrance for bade holders.
2913,I have never had any issues with the staff they are really nice 
2914,"The hotel loo was very good but access to city loos are very disappointing. Space was very restricted and most toilets were too low for my height which is 6' 2"" / 1.87m"
2915,One set of disabled toilets shared with baby changing - easy to use and not far from anything in the park.
2916,"The Festival Theatre is probably one of the best theatres in Scotland in terms of disabled access. There is disabled parking available down the side of the theatre by stage door, and they also offer a dropoff/pickup service for wheelchair users, which you can book by calling the stage door keeper (information can be found on venue website)

Walking into the theatre, the foyer is bright and airy, with clear signage on where to go. Box office team are helpful and friendly in helping you buy or pick up tickets. There is one lift off to the right which takes you to all levels, which is brilliant to have in a multi-levelled theatre.

I haven't personally used their accessible toilets, but I have seen signage for them. There are two on the first floor (one is located in the hallway next to the ladies, and the other is down the side of the auditorium near the side exit), and two on the second floor.

The only part of the auditorium that is really wheelchair accessible (i.e. no stairs) is the stalls area, but these seats offer the best views and there are several wheelchair spaces towards the middle.

Coffee shop in ground floor box office area is bright and spacious, and fully accessible."
2917,Wide paved level paths
2918,All very aware of our needs and problems
2919,The accommodation was spacious with lots of room for a wheelchair to manoeuvre. there were no steps to negotiate
2920,Ramp available for high entrance step. 
2921,"These are beautiful cottages, accessible. The owners were very helpful. The hot tub on the patio was a nice touch but could not be used if hoisted. 4 cottages from converted farm building. Beautiful views, very peaceful. We  have visited twice already. Plenty of nearby places to visit."
2922,Disabled spaces available outside the Pier with no payment otherwise you can park in the town car park which is an accessible stroll of 5-10 minutes.
2923,"There are no toilets at the cable-cars themselves. There are toilets, including changing places, at the o2"
2924,The lift is tucked away inside the take away shop which is under the same ownership. If there is a queue it isn't easy to see but I had no problems getting into the lift.
2925,"The Picturehouse was paid for many years ago by lots of fundraising and Lottery funding to give the town 2 screens.  There is accessible parking nearby, level access, a lift to all floors, hearing assistance, an accessible toilet with a RADAR key, hearing assistance and most importantly a choice of where to sit in both auditoriums.   But it's days are numbered as the site lease is expiring soon."
2926,"This is a shop full of well priced gifts and cards, with friendly staff who go out of their way to be helpful.   It is right in the middle of town.  It is also a thriving newsagent business, and very much a part of the fabric of the town.  The shop is light and well laid out with very wide aisles so all parts are accessible to a wheelchair user; it si possible to turn round and reverse.
The threshold of the shop is slightly raised but there are people available to help. "
2927,Good level access with plenty space inside for easy maneouvring.
2928,"On the small side and lacking full changing facilities, but clean."
2929,Not thrilled at being at the level of the pitch but easy to get in and out. 
2930,Limited number of disabled bays but plenty of space if you choose your time to visit parking should not be a problem.
2931,Fantastic staff - very helpful. Hadn't heard about Euans guide so explained all about it. They were very keen to be included in Euans guide. 
2932,Buses stop around the corner and there is limited parking available outside
2933,"Only accessible by private car or taxi as a rural location, narrow country lanes. Use Google maps not Sat Nav. Helpful instructions on their website.
Parking outside property all level to front door."
2934,Fully described with photos on the website
2935,"Full accessible, very large in size and had a variety of handles, grab rails etc. Overall it was brilliant."
2936,"As soon as we entered the Station we were well looked after I was in a Powered Wheelchair and my Sister was using elbow crutches, when the train arrived at the platform the station guard had me positioned at the right spot on the platform, where we were to enter the guards van, the train guard fixed up the ramp, and with me using a powered wheelchair I had no problem entering the van, my sister brother in law, and I were given free tea, coffee, and shortbread, which was most enjoyable"
2937,The staff where all incredibly happy friendly and helpful 
2938,"Space for 1 manual chair and 2 carers, bars, hygenic"
2939,"Excellent accommodation. !  Lovely spacious rooms ,well and tastefully furnished , very well equipped with overhead tracking in bedroom and bathroom ,
In a beautiful setting overlooking the golf course and links.Staff were very helpful .
Thoroughly recommend"
2940,Wide doorways with a good layout.
2941,"If you are using a toilet witha carer also present, this toilet is very small, there was barely room for my chair and the two of us to actually maneuver ourselves into the right position.  The toilet was also extraordinarily high,  making it problematic to use. It is a radar key toilet, but it seemed to always be open, perhaps because it doubles as baby changing."
2942,The building is fairly tight in places but we were very impressed with what they've done to make it accessible.
2943,Friendly and extremely obliging
2944,The staff are polite and friendly.
2945,Staff (volunteers) greeted us at the boat and helped us get to know how to get on/off and made sure my husband was suitably experienced to take her out.  All nice and friendly and helpful.
2946,"Access into the grounds was good. The paths are either concrete or compressed gravel and nice and wide. Entrances were mainly wide. Access into and around the gardens was mostly okay. There were some grass paths but you could just avoid those if you don't fancy them. I had my mountain trike so it was fine for me. 

Access into the house was via two ramps. They were both just about wide enough, a little steep but manageable. The ground floor of the house was pretty good, level access once inside and wide doors. They have a one way system in place, which worked pretty well. There is no lift, so access to the other floors is via stairs. That is no good for me but we did have a look at the virtual tour. It was okay... nothing special but better than nothing."
2947,"Well equipped loo, has a baby change station too. Might be a squeeze for a carer. "
2948,Immaculate! Great toilet facilities
2949,"It’s hard to fault staff, for us, always helpful and willing, friendly and gets on with it.
We have always been welcomed warmly to whatever hall we have needed, so have offered high marks."
2950,Very helpful friendly staff.
2951,The car park is at the start if the walk. Brown tourist signs direct you from nearby roads. There are several blue badge spaces nearest to the path.  I'm guessing buses pass nearby but I did not take note.
2952,Bearing in mind that you are on safari - it's amazingly accessible! You remain in your vehichle for much of the day but the camps are well thought out with dedicated parking spaces - which can be helpful as at certain times of the day when organised tours get back they can get really busy. The camps have step free access although there can be some quite steep gradients on some of the paths but these are not that long. There were also accessible loos signed throughout. There was quite a lot of decking and some gravel paths involved but the rest was tarmac. Shops at the camps and the gates were level access although some of them were quite tightly packed with merchandise. There were different cafes and restaurants at the camps that had different food options depending on whether you were after quick bite or sit down meal - again these were accessible and you could arrange tables and chairs as you needed to. 
2953,There are lifts on each floor taking you up to the next floor. The staff are very friendly and helpful so dont hesitate to ask them for help. There are also rams throughout the attraction to avoid the use of steps. There is level/ramped access to the venue as well as access to the gardens an grounds.
2954,No dedicated parking but on street parking is available at the John Hope Gateway. It can be very busy at times.
2955,There was a ramp via a side entrance the doors were heavy but kind visitors to the stadium helped us. The seats were easy to get to and you are clearly directed. 
2956,"Car park nearby with designated disabled parking , bus stop fairly close , train station a bit further away."
2957,There's steps free access from the street into the café. The café is on the ground floor and all on one level. There are free standing table and chairs. There is a large counter with a food display. I think the part of the counter where the till is would most likely be too high for a wheelchair user. 
2958,We took the tram. Very accessible and comfortable
2959,"A very blustery day for this visit but we got out of the vehicle anyway!
A very well presented carpark with lots of bays and clearly marked disabled ones nearest to the museum building. Level and flat so my mobility scooter had very little problems. 
Automatic doors prevented the usual tussle, therfore a smooth entry. 
The staff were informative and friendly, they had no issues with the mobility scooter except to advise that access to the preserved cottage would be limited to outside only.I was fine with that.
The remains of the museum was very easy to get around in my mobility scooter, wide aisles, spaces to manoeuvre etc. Ambient lighting was very soothing. The items and exhibits were at appropriate hieght for me to read info labels .
Outside was the massive field that the battle of Colloden took place on. Small gravel paths made moving about ok  However I didn't see the plaque comemorating  the battle as it was in the middle of the field, a long way off and the weather was blowing up a hoolie!
All in all a very nice, informative and relaxing afternoon. Well done Scottish National Trust "
2960,"Ha ha, is within Buchanan Bus Station, so can't really be nearer transport!

Is also right next door to  large multi-storey carpark (Concert Hall Carpark).

Glasgow Queen Street train station is a short walk away. "
2961,Accessible for largest of chairs. Friendly staff and punters. You can play all day for free. 
2962,The staff we meet during our visit were very helpful 
2963,There are three disabled toilets within this store. All are spacious and have appropriate equipment within them including rails and an alarm system. Whilst in store this alarm system was activated and the first aid staff responded quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately the toilets are located on the top (3rd) floor. There are lifts to get to this floor however which are spacious also. 
2964,The staff are very friendly and obviously trying hard. I'm sure any lack of customer service is down to inexperience.
2965,Door was open and counter easy to access. Tables too close together for scooter access 
2966,"Craigie Farm & Deli is a very popular place so expect it to be busy, especially at weekends!  We visited on Saturday with my Dad who was in his wheelchair.  

The car park is level & tarmac with disabled parking bays right next to the main entrance making access easy for those in wheelchairs or with limited mobility.

The entrance into the deli & cafe has a slightly raised floor plate at the door which was a bit of a challenge to push the wheelchair over but it was fine once we decided to 'reverse' in!

The deli itself & the cafe are both very accessible & the food is delicious, a great variety of home-baking & main dishes as well as great coffee.

Some of the tables aren't ideal for wheelchairs as they have a large metal base which means that wheelchairs cant get close to the tables.   The ones in the conservatory are much better & allow wheelchairs to be pushed right in close to the tables.

There's a nice outdoor seating area overlooking the kids play area with a great view. Some of the tables here are picnic tables so not ideal for wheelchairs but there are a few others that would allow a wheelchair to be pushed in.

The staff are very friendly & happy to help to move chairs etc if required.

The toilet facilities are good & there's plenty of space in the disabled one.  It's accessed through a swing door so it may be better to have someone to hold this open if needed.  

The areas where the farm animals are is also easily accessible for wheelchairs being tarmac.  Don't expect a mini zoo, there are usually pigs (often with piglets!), a pony & hens so not lots of different animals.  Dogs are well catered for with water bowls & there are outdoor tables & kennels where you can leave your dog if you wish to.

All in all, it's a great place to visit although do be prepared for it to be very busy, especially in the summer months when pick your own berries is at peak volume."
2967,We parked in the nearby shopping centre carpark.
2968,"Signage throughout the resort is clear and east to follow, especially while skiing or snowboard on the piste. However no large print or easy read available. 
Most areas are accessible and first time sit-skiers or adaptive skiers will be accompanied by a Whistler Adaptive Rep.
Whistler Mountain is more accessible to the wheelchair user than Blackcomb Mountain. The Village Gondola can accommodate a person in a wheelchair Guests can ride to the top of Whistler on the gondola and easily access the Roundhouse, through a wheelchair accessible door and lift."
2969,"Large disabled toilet, and the other toilet is also pretty big."
2970,The parking at Tidmoor Cottages is fine as you park next to the cottage which makes it very easy for unloading.
2971,Every time a goal was scored the security staff and police stood side by side making a barrier at the side of pitch right in front of wheelchair users causing them to block their view. I know this was a security measure bit very unfair to wheelchair users.
2972,This Caffe Nero is in the way to the entrance to Westfield. Level access throughout and good accessible loo.
2973,I find the staff  very friendly  & always ready to help.  They are always kind & they never mind showing us the way upstairs in order to view a movie from the back of the screen.
2974,"Once inside it was great and staff were very helpful.  Roomy, and very accessible.  No large print menus available.   
The only way in if you have a chair is via the back.  There is no signage to indicate that this is where the accessible entrance is and if there hadn't been a Chef standing by the door, I wouldn't have know it was the right door being as there is no sign and no doorbell.   They could do with a portable ramp and doorbell at the front or at least at the back and signs on the back door entrance."
2975,Staff OK but not very knowledgeable about access.
2976,"Not great. There is a small lip into the venue, and double doors. The doors are wide, but not automatic. Once inside, half of the restaurant is up a set of stairs, and the seats downstairs are mostly built into the window which isn't ideal if you are using a wheelchair. The bar is high with no dropped counter. Lighting is good for a bar however."
2977,"Lots of parking available, and disabled parking spaces near to the entrance. Bus stop also very close to entrance, so very convenient if using public transport."
2978,"An ancient woodland known as Needwood forest, once part of the lands owned by the Berkeley family of Gloucestershire, had wild boar and fallow deer that roamed freely, where in the 13th century, a Thomas de Berkeley liked to hunt in the forest, 
and he had a hunting lodge built. He had married the daughter of the Earl of Derby in 1267. The lodge was a large 3 storey rather attractive house in its own way, and he named it as Byrkley Lodge.
However, the family line, through the De Ferrers side, had to forfeit the estate to the crown, and the forest passed on to King Henry 4th.
During the mid 1400’s King Edward 4th redeveloped the lodge, but still used it for hunting.

In 1803 an act of parliament was passed that meant that Needwood Forest could now be deforested, and by 1851 it had become one of the highly cultivated areas around Burton on Trent, before it enclosed some 20 farms.
The lodge was then passed in 1850 to the Bass family, where again the house was redeveloped in the 1870’s. Following the death of Sir William Bass in 1952 the estate was sold on, and so Byrkley lodge was demolished, and today, just 490 acres of woodland remain, some parts still open to the public.

330 acres of this land was now taken over by the FA (football association) who wanted a purpose built complex to be built solely for football, so in 2001 the land was bought from the forte Hotel group for some £2 million pounds.
Following a number of years of indecisions, in 2006 the FA decided to wait until a decision was made on how to proceed. By now the football pitches had been laid although construction of outbuildings and dressing rooms had not even started.
Finally, under the leadership of the world famous footballer, Trevor Brooking, the 
project was approved the go ahead.

The centre has 12 training pitches , grass and artificial surfaces, one being a full sized 
indoor pitch, and it has fantastic facilities, which was finally completed in 2012, and opened by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on 9th October 2012. It acts as the main training for the FA,s coaching and players development for all 28 of Englands national teams, both men and women, including the disabled teams.

OUR REVIEW
After coming off the A38, it was quite a long drive through countryside which caused a little concern for we began to feel we had entered the wrong SAT NAV directions,
which were DE13 9PD, (and having passed a sign at an island for St George’s Park, which we ignored and continued to follow the SAT NAV  for quite some more miles) guessing that sign had been for coaches ect, as country lanes were narrow at some points, a much nicer drive for cars, so suggest you follow SAT NAV as well.
Eventually we arrived at the gate for St George’s Park (photo 1)  and then drove along a parkland driveway (photo 2) before passing an unusual breed of cattle (photo 3) These are White Park cattle, and you will see they are mainly white animals, with black points on their muzzle, ears, eye trims and feet, with large long wide-spreading horns. They had a number of young calf’s on our visit in May, and quite interesting to watch this rare breed, which apparently were bred especially for park lands with enclosed pastures.
Then we passed by the first area of training pitches (photo 4) which as expected were well maintained and in excellent condition (photo 5) before finally rounding a bend that led towards a car park (photo 6) but this is the overflow car park, so ignore this parking and continue ahead to reach the hotels main car park (photo 7) and quite a lot of disabled bays (photo 8) which will allow your carer to push you along the level paths to reach front entrance (photo 9) with an automatic push button to let you enter the hotel (it does work, but press the button to one side of the button) 

Once inside hotel, you will see it has a large wide open reception foyer with reception desk ahead of you (photo 10).

On this review, we concentrate on the training facilities for the hotel, so over to the left you will find the Health club and Spa double door entrance (photo 11) which straight away encourages a fitness test, as it was rather a heavy fire door type, and my husband found it difficult to open, so had to get out of chair and struggle to get 
in ) which led towards the reception desk, with plenty of chocolate offerings tempting you before you even start any training (photo 12)
The gym however had plenty on offer, all very modern and well maintained (photos 13th and 14) before another door led out (15) and along a corridor (16) to the large well used indoor swimming pool (photo 17)."
2979,Very small lift at the side of main entrance to get in. Once inside it is flat and spacious for wheelchair users. Internal lift for other floor.
2980,"A lovely quiet walk for less than hour even if you do the loop in both directions. Spacious enough to allow 2 to walk side by side. Mostly flat. The walk is definitely 5 stars but there are no toilets and the car park is busy at weekends, and without marked spaces could make access more difficult."
2981,"The venue is a good way out of the city centre so we used a Taxi to and from the venue. there is a mini bus that goes from the city centre to Strawberry fields about once an hour each way the mini bus is does not have a wheelchair lift. the  Web site  www.strawberryfieldliverpool.com gives you details about bus times and the hours the exhibition is open
There is a large car park however they have as yet not marked out any Blue Badge Spaces hopefully they will do this soon"
2982,"There are 3 entrances to the gardens. The entrance next to the Old Fortress is step free and I think so too is the one in the centre. However the entrance by the children's playground involves a couple of steps. It's a level garden with quite wide paths, areas to lawn and plenty of flowers and trees. There are a few pleasant shady spots. In the garden there are reliefs of Gerald and Lawrence Durrell, as well as various bust and statues and a couple of ponds. There are nice view towards the Old Fortress and out to sea. Plenty of benches to sit on. There is a small children's play area with swings, but it wasn't noisy."
2983,"Public Toilets are not available, many just use the road side as a toilet for pee. Many toilets are not cleaned properly, tissue has to be taken with you."
2984,"The inside of the venue was all on one level.
The cafe is laid our well with different types of tables and chairs to suit different needs, though they are a bit too close to area in some areas.
The shop and exhibition area all flat and signs are large and easy to read.
Outside is very accessible with wide paths and steady ramps."
2985,Well sign posted. Onstreet disabled parking. Bus / train station too far away. 
2986,Could not have been more helpfulbor friendly. Real enthusiasts for the venue.
2987,The Harry Potter Shop and the photograph experience at platform 9 3/4 was accessible. Situated on and by the concourse you can wheel in and get to see everything.
2988,"Excellent access. If you are on your own, I was told by the excellent member of staff at the Playhouse box office, a taxi driver would know exactly where to drop you off and from there, a member of box office staff would guide you to your seat. Couldn't get better than that!"
2989,Parking available on street and a drop off point is available in the dedicated car park to the rear of the building.
2990,"Couldn't be more friendly, helpful and accomodating"
2991,We drove and there is ample parking at Leuchie House and assistance with loading/unloading
2992,"Given the nature of the building,  I found the manoeuvrability around the shower area was quite tight (although perfectly manageable).

Normally we have carers but on holiday I look after my husband's needs myself. I found co-ordinating a portable hoist / shower chair / wheelchair needs careful planning but after two stays I am improving!"
2993,Staff were helpful and enthusiastic. Helped us to take some groups photos.
2994,"There were staff dotted around the venue to offer help and lead activities. In the café, the staff were lovely and the introduction to the maze quiz was easy to understand. Overall, the staff were excellent."
2995,"Decent sized loo but if they removed large wicker display baskets it would be 4*. Look pretty but make it too tight for wheelchair. 
(Nothing gets 5* without a Changing Place!)"
2996,One in the Centre- abit rustic but large and functional. 
2997,Helpful but not always understanding of issues
2998,"Did not need to use the facilities and also as explained in other reviews I am a hoist transfer so can't use normal disabled toilets. However, I did not see any signage for a disabled toilet when entering the restaurant. "
2999,"A flawless experience from start to finish. Seated at the front, right in front of the stage made me feel at the heart of the performance. Before reaching this position, I was guided through undercover pathways, protecting me from the rain, to grab a cuppa before heading into the tent.

There are generously roomy toilets to the right of the entrance, both a disabled toilet and a fully equipped changing places toilet.

Staff are incredibly helpful and go above and beyond to make your experience as easy and as delightful as possible.

I love a bookshop and the one on site does not disappoint. There is so much space to move around , I spent an incredibly long time browsing!"
3000,Staff are all very friendly and helpful 
3001,Wheelchair accessible restaurant with tasty tapas.
3002,"Friendly, patient staff. "
3003,everyone has been helpful except in the Fent Shop where they are particularly grumpy about getting stuff from upstairs.  No lift.
3004,Level access throughout. Lovely surface to roll along if you're a wheelchair user. All shops were open fronted on to the main concourse and accessible.
3005,I had a nice evening meal at the restaurant. The service was good and the food was tasty. Accessible parking bays are right outside and sat at the relaxed dining area which is close to the accessible toilet. 
3006,This is self catering accommodation without staff. Our hosts were however on hand should we have needed anything.
3007,ample disabled parking
3008,Most of the volunteers/staff were very helpful.
3009,A perfect hotel for those with mobility impairment.
3010,Accessible hair salon with portable sink option available if you want
3011,"A lot of staff available within the building. Eg. At the Cafe, Gift shop and the Box office. Staff seemed friendly and approachable.  "
3012,"Basically, inaccessible venue by virtue of the building."
3013,Car a necessity. Parking in the property's own drive.
3014,parking at the door.
3015,"Every staff member we encountered were extremely helpful and very friendly. The staff at information were more than happy to tell us what areas of the reserve was best for accessibility and tell us all about the place. It shone through they were very passionate about what they do. The staff in the restaurant were amazing too, as with minimal fuss just asked us what we wanted and said they would bring it to the table for us and moved any seats we wanted so we could get our wheelchairs in."
3016,"Inadequate parking for size of venue (significantly below government minimum number).  Disabled bays that were there were partly fenced off.  

Served by the 35 bus right outside.  

Main entrance has steps.  Alternative entrance not well signposted or always manned. "
3017,"Large carpark with a bays of disabled parking directly opposite the main doors of the adjacent pub The Haywain. And then more disabled bays outside the actual hotel door. The walk from the hotel to the pub ( where all meals can be found) is about 30 metres , the walkway is not totally covered. There are dropped kerbs from the actual carpark onto the pavement and entrance to the actual hotel and put is step free."
3018,Staff are fabulous
3019,Accessible loo is on ground floor combined with baby changing facilities. Toilet and sink have white grab rails. Toilet i left hand transfer but large nappy bin in the way. Toilet had a small flush handle and emergency alarm was behind the bin. Due to the bins and changing table the loo was smaller than it could have been. Would struggle to fit two people and large wheelchair in at same time. Nearest changing places toilet is at Derby City Council house or inside Intu Derby.
3020,Roll in shower off ground bedroom. Plenty of rails around toilet. Very easy. Excellent.
3021,"Could not fault any of the staff, from my initial phonecall re parking, to the security and driver at car park and the security and assistance staff at the venue!! First class!!"
3022,"Choice of 3 on ground floor with hoists. 1 Standard, 2x shower toilets, ceiling hoists and movable sink units. Upstairs standard accessible toilet-no hoist with all other features in place."
3023,Great -  super helpful and super enthusiastic.
3024,"There is no car park at the cafe, but it's not too far from Lincoln central car park."
3025,Did not use
3026,Beverley was incredible. She went out of her way to get our car parking organised. There was a bit of a problem on the day around seating for personal assistants as the away wheelchair spaces were full and some of the wheelchair bays had been given to PAs to use. Beverley came round in person to arrange a temporary solution and promised to arrange a contingency plan so this situation didn't happen in future.
3027,"The staff were very friendly and the lady was extremely kind in her manner.
The gentleman was also very friendly but although very polite at breakfast did not offer toast or tell us where things like the marmalade etc were. My parents do not ask for things they are not offered and felt a bit uncomfortable when we had to ask for some toast. I expect it was just a forgetful moment! "
3028,"Plenty of accessible toilets, they appeared clean, rooms big enough to allow carer as well. "
3029,In centre of the town.   7 accessible parking bays and one drop-off point within 60 metres of venue.   Access has two small steps or can be achieved by using a ramp that is just to the left of the door.   Has an accessible toilet (better than most).   Staff are very helpful.   Has an old style feel to it with staff dress and music to match and conversation is not drowned out by excessive noise.
3030,"Hotel Review The White House 

If you need disabled access and facilities forget this hotel. It's a danger if you use a wheelchair. 

Disabled access and facilities are none existent. The disabled bedroom has no handrails in the shower. There is no shower seat in the shower as advised and I was given a garden sun lounger to use. The bathroom floor is slippy and no mats supplied watch it or you will fall for sure. The toilet is a normal low level toilet so useless for accessible use and will cause a fall. 
Access to the hotel and bedroom was pathetic. No ramps I had to use pieces of wood."
3031,"Fantastic staff; always friendly, and do whatever they can to assist. Always enjoy visiting due to the staff (and delicious food and drink)"
3032,All staff were lovely and were very welcoming.
3033,This supermarket has very good step free access for a wheelchair user. Although an elderly scooter user almost ran me over when I was in there.
3034,"Disappointing, painful and exhausting day at Legoland.  As a disabled mother, I hired a wheelchair from Legoland guest services so that i could enjoy the day with my daughter.  Sadly i soon realised that I could in no way use a self propelled wheelchair on my own due to the steep hills and narrow pathways on the resort.  It would however have been ok if I had anither adult with me but it would have been nice to do this on my own.  I had to return my chair and therefore could only stay on the resort for 1 hour which only gave my daughter the chance to have 1 ride and see a couple of things.  Very disappointing as a disabled parent that I couldn’t use a wheelchair or mobility scooter on my own.  The disabled toilets were always in use and only 1 per toilet location.  No changing places and most importantly no queue pass for rides for people with mobility issues which is a real shame as queing without a wheelchair was impossible for me.  Really disappointed at Legoland’s lack of knowledge and range around accessibility.  They should learn from Flamingoland which is excellent.  Would not go back to Legoland."
3035,"The door is not automatic and opens into the shop. This shop is cosy with space to move around tables. Signage was clear with contrasting colours. There are hard chairs around circular tables, tall stools against a bench at the window and low soft seats in the corner. The food display is at eye level for wheelchair users and the counter where you pay is lower down and card machine can be handed to you. The counter where you collect the drinks are higher than eye level for wheelchair user but staff are more than happy to help handing it lower or bringing things to your table."
3036,There is no accessible toilet at this site.
3037,"There are two large car parks surrounding the centre.
On the main road over looking the shops , there are two bus stops and also a taxi rank not too long down the road."
3038,The staff was very friendly and helpful when I  visited the hotel and were happy to answer my questions.
3039,"The students union is situated within York St John University. It is easily assessable, with wide automatic doors with a button to press to open them, these doors lead into the students union foyer. When in the students union it is all one level with no steps."
3040,"We only explored a small part of the park because we did not want to wait 5+ hours for the next scheduled ticket entrance - lesson learned, you should book tickets in advance if you want to see all of Gaudi's work up close. You can still see a decent amount from the free section of the park, but it's super busy and the upper levels are quite steep and hilly. We stuck to the flattest, most level ground to have a quick look around and get a good view of the city."
3041,"Here to see Glasgow Rocks play basketball so have my foam finger at the ready! The venue is accessed via an elevator on the outside which takes you to the next level up and the viewing platform. Once in the arena, there’s a huge amount of accessible seating!"
3042,Parking is right next to the bungalow entrance.
3043,Entrance door is heavy to open but they do have a door alarm if need assistance. Ramped level access after that. Lights are dimmed. Could fit under table (my chair has centre mount leg rests). Straw appeared to be made from paper. 
3044,Great view of stage from wheelchair platform.
3045,Staff are generally helpful
3046,"The hotel does have the benefit of an underground car park. Disabled guests can arrange to use this by contacting the hotel in advance of their stay.

Lauriston Place is served by several Lothian bus services; all of which have wheelchair access."
3047,Plenty disabled parking spaces right by the main entrance.
3048,"Within the visitors centre there is an accessible toilet which I would say is an average size, although there are a few bins in the toilet which might cause transfer problems.

I’m not sure if there is a Changing Place toilet near the Falkirk Wheel."
3049,Level surfaces throughout building.  Lifts to upper floors and ramp access to front.  Plenty of seating to res.
3050,"As I say, I am not disabled, but the accommodation is eminently suitable for disabled, with a great wet room and a spacious apartment."
3051,Moira was incredibly helpful and kind throughout our visit. A very interesting lady who wrote a book about setting the place up! She kept in touch throughout our visit and was always very pleasant with us. 
3052,"Willie and Jan Orr, the owners met us when we arrived and had advice on accessible things to do in the area such as the nearby cycle track. They were really pleasant and friendly but unobtrusive, while making it clear they were more than happy to be contacted if we needed them. "
3053,This accommodation is suitable for both wheelchair users and anyone else who likes excellent facilities that are quiet and peaceful with lovely views. It is possible to hire a range of extra equipment but most of what you need is already there such as ceiling hoists commodes low counter in kitchen and easy access in and out to the garden. Therapies are also available . Definitely worth more visits .       
3054,"We were going to a gig at Òran Mór on Friday night and we wanted to do it on the cheap because we had been rather social recently. We had a banana and a chocolate bar on the bus but fancied a snack, which was better than grabbing a pint. "
3055,"Whilst Edinburgh City Centre is not bad for wheel chair users, it can be close to impossible to visit certain areas such as Prjnces Street, Rose Street and lately George Street for anyone else with mobility problems.  The Council have been pedestrianising  many areas and putting in cycle paths. This has involved taking away parking spaces and putting bus stops too far away for people who have to use walking aids such as sticks or crutches. The few parking spaces including those designated for folk with disabilities are always full. I recently visited Princes Street and couldnt get back to the car because it was too far away. My friend had to make an illegal move onto Princes Street to come and get me. I wont be going back."
3056,good
3057,"The pastor invited me to share my views and help advise them on how they can make the church more accessible for people with disabilities. They are concerned about the access and are keen to make further adaptation including paving a ramp to reception and from there having a platform lift to get down to the cafe. They are also looking to improve the toilets and entryway. There were staff around who are happy to help, friendly, and not ‘in your face’. Everyone was really friendly and helpful and I was encouraged by their eagerness to make the church accessible not only to those with mobility problems but also people hard of hearing. "
3058,Well organised and super helpful.
3059,"The hotel consists of a lobby area including a restaurant, lounge and champagne bar open to all on the ground floor and directly above this 5 floors of guest bedrooms.  The main entrance to the hotel features a ramp making it suitable for guest using wheelchairs and other walking aids. The lobby area is open plan making it a space in which those with mobility problems can navigate without increased risk or difficulty.  The open plan design features glass walls and mirrors brings light into the environment but could prove disorientating for an individual with cognitive or visual impairments."
3060,The staff that we meet were all very helpful and were doing what they could to assist people in the store. They were happy to show you to a location if you could not find an item
3061,"When I visited here I got a parking space right outside by the street. This was because the 2 council car parks that are at either side of this restaurant were full, one is right across the road and the other is a 5 minute walk away. Basically due to the restaurant being in the city centre there are plenty of parking spaces nearby and taxi ranks around the town.

There are also lots of bus stops on mainly every street where buses visit regularly from all over Dundee and Angus. The train station is also just roughly a 10 minute walk away, on the other side of Slessor Gardens."
3062,Easy to use nice big space
3063,"Clea, roomy accessible loo"
3064,"Access in and around the building:

As I could not use the portable wooden ramp deployed to get up the steps in the entrance foyer but review stops here. My powerchair would have been in danger of tipping over if I attempted the gradient of the ramp. That said, some manual wheelchair users would be able to negotiate the ramp.

Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:

I was unable to access other areas including the reception, dining area and accessible bedrooms. I have awarded a one-star rating in acknowledgement that other manual wheelchair users may be able to use the facilities."
3065,Very accessible mall with a variety of stores .
3066,Everything is made very easy.
3067,"On the 16th March 2020 I visited Mcdonalds in Lancaster, I traveled there via the college bus. I noticed when I got there that there was no car parks near by to park your car. The staff there were lovely and their communication was fine. The toilets were alright I liked them. I had something to eat and drink which was nice. I think McDonalds was good and I will be going back again. "
3068,"Staff are very friendly, but there's nothing they can do to overcome the access problems.  Would probably be very helpful for those with visual and audio impairment."
3069,"The signage is very clear and stands out well due to the good colour scheme of the sign. In order to get into the venue, there is a small step from the footpath into the shop which was assessed to cause a small barrier of access for an individual with a vision impairment. Inside subway, there is also another step down to the till which is quite large and caused some issues again for our individuals who were less stable on their feet. "
3070,We parked our car in the car park and there are 2 disabled parking bays
3071,There was a grumpy guard at the gate but others were good.
3072,automatic push button door at the entrance. No lowered desk so might have to shout to let them know you're there! There is a lift to the upper level where the gym is. if you need a locker you can a pound deposit at reception.
3073,The car park and Disabled Parking is very uneven gravel. They do have a ramp access but unable to access the building on my own as steps to the main doors. Needed someone to open the disabled access door. There is a platform for wheelchairs to sit on at the back of the goals however the ramp to the platform is very steep and I would not be able to access the platform without my husbands help. Only Disabled toilet was in the female curling room but it was very large and had plenty of handles. I did notice that there was not an emergency red cord and lacking on handles on the door. The Cafe was level access but was quite cramped once inside and no lowered counter.
3074,Coll bunkhouse is fully accessible. It is all on one level
3075,"Easy to enter the restaurant as on the level, but then you have to pick your seating area carefully, there are far to many steps to have to reach some of the areas, do tell them a disabled person will be arriving so they can make sure a table is reserved so as to get chairs close to table.
Toilets are awkward, as you will read.




"
3076,"Clapham Junction is one of the UK's busiest transport hubs. It has lifts to all platforms and staff usually on hand to provide help and ramp assistance. There is one accessible toilet. There are plenty of shops and places selling food and drink, and there's a shopping concourse at the main entrance. The station is also served by London Overground, which offers a turn-up-and-go service - no need to book assistance 24 hours in advance."
3077,"I didn’t interact much with the staff myself because my helper went up to order for me due to it being busy but, I was sitting next to the customer counter. They were very friendly with all customers that came in, chatting, asking how their day was and making everyone feel welcome.

During any of my visits to any Costa Coffee’s I feel staff have always been great, it definitely makes me want to return."
3078,Toilets were in the central area of the barracks and weren't easy to find as there were loads of doors painted in the same colour - I had thought I'd end up opening the wrong one at times! The large concrete ramp with railings was a great clue that I was in the right place. Accessible toilets - a choice of two after going into the building.
3079,Good access once you get inside.
3080,"Every single one of them made us feel very welcome and we got the feeling they were happy to see us.
Delightful group of people."
3081,"There was level access, wide door and space to move around to find seats or get up to the bar."
3082,The Doubletree by Hilton is the old hospitality Inn on Cambridge Street in Glasgow City center. I have been here many times for conferences etc.
3083,"This is a small service station on the M74 Southbound side of the road it does however have the range of services that you expect to find including fuel a shop selling everything from newspapers to Scottish souvenirs. There is also a food area that offers take away or sit in we did not visit this section during our visit    
There is also a charging point for electric vehicles this is right next to the Blue Badge spaces in front of the main services building  "
3084,There is only one entrance and it has two tall steps. This makes the place completely inaccessible for wheelchair users.
3085,helpful...no pushy
3086,"Didn't drive there, went from st johns centre"
3087,A disabled toilet is provided on the ground floor. The toilet and lift are situated next to the bar. During busy times this could mean access to these facilities are blocked by people queuing to be served at the bar.
3088,The staff were friendly and very helpful. I think the problem during the phone call to check accessibility was genuinely a language barrier issue.
3089,"The owners of cottage live across courtyard. Very friendly  and came out to welcome us and make sure everything in the cottage was as we needed it, they  want to do all they can to help their customers have a good holiday, but they are in no way obtrusive. They have collected knowledge of accessible places in The Yorkshire Dales and make this available."
3090,There was a plentiful amount of disabled toilets which weren't just situated on the ground floor
3091,"This is an exhibition that shows the latest advances in the technology to help people with disabilities and other difficulties.
It is an annual show.
Parking is free.
Entrance is free also.

It is normally in September. "
3092,Staff were very helpful.
3093,"The wet room was modern, spacious, clean and had lots of grab rails and two red cords, sink was a great height too. "
3094,"This posh and luxurious hotel has a great events space called The Stables.  I was visiting for Visit Scotlands Thistle Awards.  All the staff were lovely but understated, every time I stood up a waiter would arrive my by side with my crutches.  Completely step free from the carpark through out."
3095,Floor was very flat - no lip or anything to get in from the street. No steps or obstructions - would find it difficult manoeuvring a wheelchair unless you asked for a table closer to the door
3096,Reasonable toilet with plenty of grab rails
3097,parked just outside front door of cottage.
3098,"Rynek Glowny is the largest medieval square in Europe and it is huge. The square was busy when I visited, on a Monday afternoon in June, and had lots of tourists but because of it large it was reasonably easy to avoid the crowds. The square itself is level and step free. There are large, flat cobblestones which were generally level, rather than protruding. I personally found it quite easy to walk around with my crutch in this area. However, I went on a hot, sunny day and I personally would not like to try to negotiate this large open space in the snow and ice. Also a couple of local people I was talking to, who had no obvious disabilities, said to me that the area is difficult to walk round in the rain.  

On the square are a few notable buildings. As I only went into 2 of them I will review them here.

Cloth Hall

In the middle of the square is the Cloth Hall. It's huge. There is step free access to the ground floor through open archways at either end. Inside there are stalls either side selling crafts and tourist souvenirs.  The stalls are at standing height. The building has nice architecture and features so it is well worth walking through even if you don't want to shop. the Cloth Hall is free to visit.

St Mary's Church

St Mary's Church, is one of the churches in the main square, and it is recognisable by its unmatching twin towers. On the hour, every hour, a trumpeter plays a short tune from the taller tower. I was in the square when this happened, I was not standing too close to the church and I struggled to hear the trumpeter, due to the general noise in the square and possibly the wind direction that day. I would therefore suggest trying to be near the church on the hour if you want to hear it. 

I went inside the church. There are 2 entrances to the church, one for people wanting to worship, and admission for them is free. However, they only have access to the back of the church as the front of the church is cordoned off. 

If you are facing the church's twin towers, walk round to the right. You will come into a courtyard. The visitors' entrance to the church is on the left. However before you go in you need to purchase a ticket. the ticket office is directly opposite the entrance, see photo. There is a single step to get inside and the counter is at standing height. When I visited tickets were 10 Poland złoty, about £2. The church has step free access with ramps at entrance and exit and step free elsewhere. There are fixed pews but if you make towards the front altar there are benches, without back support, which were easier for me to use.

"
3099,3 blue badge spaces but car park is gravel so not ideal for wheelchair
3100,"Caulders is a family run garden centre. Lovely cafe with fabulous views over Glasgow. Table service - I can strongly recommend the meringues ! Outside seating area which is accessed from the main cafe - it's down a slight slope which is wheelchair accessible.  Good garden centre with everything you need. Inside has plenty of different areas e.g. clothing, jewellery, gifts, pets and lots more. Great disabled toilet "
3101,There are a significant number of disabled parking spaces behind most buildings at Port Solent. The problem is then relying on the 2 lifts to be in working order for you to change levels in order to access the main boardwalk area.  The closest parking spaces to the two lifts are located firstly outside the Odeon Cinema and secondly behind Casa Brazil and David Lloyd Gym. 
3102,Lots of large disabled parking spaces on each level of the car park.
3103,The accessible shower/wet room is excellent.  The shower chair/commode is a self-propelled aquatec ocean XL.  There is an accessible toilet and wash basin and grab rails if required.
3104,"This was my first trip on board the new Caledonian Sleeper rolling stock. Having used the previous rolling stock on a regular basis, I was excited to see what this one had in store, accessibility wise. The booking process was easy, I booked about 2 weeks in advance and secured a double accessible cabin (I asked for this) for the princely sum of £108.90 for a changeable ticket, including breakfast. Which isn't bad!

I've taken a video tour and uploaded it to YouTube, but for the benefit of my visually impaired friends, here are some points:
* The new accessible cabin is huge compared to the old one, with plenty of turning space and a spacious double bed. 
* Although the Caledonian Sleeper boasts new en-suite rooms with showers, it seems this isn't applicable to disabled guests. There is an accessible toilet next door to the room, but no shower is to be seen. I had to request a shower token to shower at Euston Station where I arrived (although it's not all bad as it means I'm writing this review from the first class lounge!). 
* Access into the double cabin is via a large automatic door which is opened with a key card. 
* Access to the lounge car from my cabin was very simple (through one set of doors and you're there), but the doors to get there are very narrow and I don't know if larger powerchairs would get through it. 

Some more specific points are covered below in the relevant sections. "
3105,"There is an accessible loo in the new visitor centre in the car park, there is one near the house but it's not really big enough for a wheelchair. There's one at the stables but this is a long walk downhill. There is also cafe there.  "
3106,An eco friendly loo is on sight but we didn't  visit it so unable to comment.
3107,"As stated above, the entrance to the students union has disabled access buttons to press in order for the doors to open automatically. The students union is all on one level, however, to get to the offices upstairs there is no disabled access, there are stairs. The bar area is very spacious and furniture can easily be moved."
3108,"There is ample parking around the Royal Mile, parked on Chambers Street next to the museum however this might not be practical if you have difficulty walking."
3109,Wheelchair accessible museum with all exhibits at good height for wheelchair users.  Staff on hand to assist if needed.  Yr Hen Llyfrgell welsh culture centred Bodlon welsh produce shop in same building.
3110,"All staff helpful, courteous and obliging. They offered to move the chair at the table, then offered to store my wheelchair so I could transfer. They pointed out the location of the loo. "
3111,It was easy to get everywhere - there is a lift
3112,"Such a great gallery! Very spacious, good exhibitions. Sometimes a little tricky to find your way around, but Gallery attendants are always very helpful."
3113,"Staff here are friendly and always take into account all customers that may need support. If they see somebody struggling through the door, they are quick to go and offer their support, helping move chairs to make access easier and create space for a wheelchair when space is available. The only thing that puts people off this cafe is how busy it is, meaning disabled customers may struggle to find space, however the local customers seem friendly and were willing to help along with staff when help was needed."
3114,Homelands is well signposted from the main road in Lundin Links. Each lodge has a flat entry with extra wide doors to accommodate all wheelchairs.  Access to the garden is available through the lounge and also the ground floor bedroom.
3115,a baby changing facility with a disabled toilet as an afterthought by someone without a clue
3116,"Level entry and double doors to access. Doors are heavy and not automatic but they are by reception desk and the staff are always on the lookout for musicians with equipment so are really fast to open the doors and welcome you in.
All studio spaces have wide enough doors to comply with access requirements and its all on the level. One of the rooms has a stage area which does not have wheelchair access but the staff are quick and efficient at configuring the room to suit by placing drumkit, mics etc on the floor level area if no other room is available. Lighting levels are low throughout."
3117,"The staff were all friendly and helpful. My only negative is one male member of staff who we encountered several times. He was very friendly but made lots of assumptions. Suggested that 'one of the men [in our party] should push me up the ramps' and several times warned me to pace myself because it's a big place and I would get tired. He needs to realise that wheelchair users are not necessarily weak and helpless!

Everyone was great with my assistance dog. She got lots of fuss (which she loves) but they all asked first and were respectful."
3118,"The following bus routes are useful:

176, 185, 197, 356, P4 - stop outside the Museum and Gardens on London Road
122 - stops on Dartmouth Road
P13 - stops on Underhill Road
363 - stops on Sydenham Hill Road

The museum is a five to ten minute walk from Forest Hill station and is signposted from the platform 1 exit. TfL claims that Forest Hill station is step-free from street to platform (I haven't checked whether this is really true). You'll need to talk to staff if you need a ramp to board/leave the trains. Forest Hill station is on the London Overground network which offers a turn-up-and-go service, so there's no need to book assistance in advance.

Parking in the area is very difficult.
"
3119,"The cafe is spacious and the tables have been thoughtfully placed. I needed help into and out of the toilet though as there are two doors and an awkward turn. Once inside, the toilet is roomy."
3120,"Th staff in the visitor centre were very helpful asked if we needed a career ticket for free, also we are able to go back for free again if we go again within the year. At the house the volunteers were equally as helpful, recommending we do the Sir Walter Scott voice tour which was really interesting as well as informative. The audio guide works using infrared devices that you point at signs in the rooms. This was really accessible to me as it was as simple as point and click. However I understand this may not be as accessible to other people."
3121,"Step free entrance, double doors allow easier entrance. This is a small venue so they don’t have as much space as other places. I was able to set up at the front of the stage in my wheelchair for a good view. This might not work for others, but I really enjoyed it. 

There is an upstairs gallery for people who want a seat, but not sure there is a lift for this. My PA went to the bar for me, and there weren’t lowered counters, but staff were lovely so could help and make sure you get what you want. "
3122,"We visited here on Good Friday and wondered whether it would be too busy, being a bank holiday. It was fine though. The whole place is well spaced out, organised and they have made a really good effort to make as much as possible accessible for all."
3123,A very friendly lady opened the door for me entering the church and chatted away to me about the building. 
3124,"The enclosures in the zoo are spacious, allowing visitors to manoeuvre around with ease. There is also enough space for people that are in wheelchairs to get around. 
The enclosures mostly have glass panels around them, allowing visitors to view the animals from any height or angle. 
There are wheelchair lifts available for visitors who are in wheelchairs. They are located in the realm of the red ape enclosure and Oakfield house."
3125,"When you face the building there is a ramp to the left hand side, see photo, alternatively there are a couple of steps. There are 2 push button accessible doors at the entrance, see photo. There are 2 lifts to each floor. Our conference was in the  Palmerston lecture theatre, on the lower ground floor. There was a ramp to the front of the lecture theatre and front row was step free seating."
3126,Whitby is were we parked and be aware in the disabled bay parking bays you are limited to two or three hours. In the pay and display on the road you can park all day with a blue badge. Some of the car parks are pay even with the blue badge. We parked at the top of the town and walked down. It is less easy to walk up at the end of the day.
3127,"Staff were helpful, opening doors to let us in/out and moving the furniture in front of the loo - they did it all without being asked."
3128,"Great, the guy looking after us was very helpful and friendly."
3129,"The Castle, or perhaps more accurately it's ruins, sit on a mound in the open farmland north of Elgin. The overall rating would have been higher if the 'kissing gate' did not prevent wheelchair access. I could sit and admire the views whilst my visually impaired friend was able to pass through the gate and go exploring. That said, it was a great place to sit and admire the view of the castle, the surrounding countryside and the peace and tranquillity. "
3130,"There is no parking near this attraction. I would not advise trying to access this attraction via car because of this and the large amounts of traffic congestion on the surrounding roads. 

There is a metro station directly outside the cathedral with lift access to enter and exit the metro station, there is also lift access to the different stations within and the metro carriages are all level access. I noted several wheelchair users- both powered and self propelled using the metro on my visit. There is also dropped kerb access outside the cathedral. It is worth noting however that the Sagrada is on one of the busiest metro lines in the city and it gets extremely crowded on the carriages. Several of the Barcelona tourist buses stop outside the cathedral which have wheelchair ramps for access. 

Taxis are in abundance in Barcelona, so if you are able to transfer in and out of a car this would also be a good way of accessing the cathedral. There are wheelchair taxi firms which require booking in advance. "
3131,"No parking at this venue but Opposite James St Train station and Taxi Rank, Bus stop nearby and Q-park a 5 mins walk away"
3132,"We first met the receptionist was an extremely nice person was a very nice person, however, she knew very little about the wheelchair. Our 'tour guide' was very helpful throughout our tour."
3133,"all easy, level access once inside but bit of a pallavah getting to table."
3134,Large car park with disabled spaces near door.
3135,"TOILETS and REFRESHMENTS
Poor access, approached round the end of the Main Stand"
3136,The cottages are run mainly by Anne and ably assisted by her husband. Anne is very helpful and friendly making it a very easy and enjoyable holiday experience.
3137,"Fabulous building, updated facilities. Permanent and special exhibitions. Educational spaces"
3138,"Being a football fan as well as a Sheffield United fan I want to travel to any football match to enjoy football! Next on the list was the Euro 2016 match between Wales and Northern Ireland. I am unfortunately confined to a wheelchair football grounds can sometimes seem daunting experiences: where is the accessible parking, where are the seats, are they accessible, where are there disabled toilets etc.? Watching football fills people with joy and with an understanding of the problems you might encounter, I want to share my experiences of football grounds with you so you can feel a bit more confident about stadium accessibility in the future. "
3139,A great venue where a lot of planning and thought has obviously gone into providing an accessible experience for disabled visitors.
3140,Own transport. See below
3141,There is plenty of parking. 
3142,Excellent provided that you have a radar key.  The door is easily wide enough for a wheelchair and there is reasonable circulating space inside the loo.
3143,Also good - both in the Hotel and the ensuite facilities in the rooms.
3144,Huge and spacious with necessary rails and red cord.
3145,the changing room is quite large & well equipped & easily accessed. there is no pool hoist but the pool a beach type access area so the shower chair can go right in the pool.
3146,The general manager let us know about lack of accessible toilet...which we were grateful for.
3147,Very easy
3148,A very accessible exhibition in recently built interpretation centre inside walls of Cardiff Castle.
3149,Booked by a friend so little contact with staff. Very helpful when booking parking.
3150,"There are 2 lifts, around 6 toilets (2 inside the swimming area, in which 1 you can shower) all with red cords in case you need assistance, and I don't know about inside the gym, but at the swimming area you can easily get to the pool, and there are some really spacious changing cubicles for you to get changed (over 5 so don't worry)."
3151,"There is a small car park near one of the entrances to the park. This does not have any designated disabled spaces or any spaces outlined.  There is a small side road between the car park and park entrance, both sides have drop kerbs. It is also possible to park on the residential streets near the park entrances but this is not guaranteed.

There are numerous bus services passing on the main road between the city centre / train station and Acomb, another entrance to the park is located on this road. There are bus stops very close to the entrance on both sides of the road. There are drop kerbs and a central island if the road needs crossing to get to the park entrance. 

Each of the four entrances to the park have level access and the gates are held open during the parks opening hours. The openings are wide."
3152,Very interesting. Lots of buses & Morris cars. Disabled loo
3153,I used one of the  Disabled parking bays at the Seabird ventre and my wife pused me along to the hut on the harbour
3154,"Glenshee has a large carpark which is conveniently close to the Centre/slopes - in comparison to other ski centres.

Be aware though, occasionally on busy weekends/holidays this can be totally full by early in the morning, so you need to be there early to be sure you get in (were talking by 8.30am early!). We went on a weekday and it was fine.

The car-park is a large rough area of ground, there didn't appear to be any markings, disabled spaces or otherwise.

I am not aware of any public transport. Some ski-clubs do organise coaches, and sometimes via Facebook etc you can find people wanting to car-share.
"
3155,"we didn't find it first time around as off the foyer, not with other toilets, which were signed from the hall"
3156,"There are many disabled spots lined up in front of the building, also with the pool being almost in the center of Coatbridge there are regular buses for those who cannot drive. "
3157,The staff were exemplary in assisting my husband and i to get settled before the show
3158,"Not much parking around, although you could parking off the street, but the shop is on a busy main road and right next to popular bus routes going to Ocean Terminal. "
3159,Generally pretty good although not as helpful as at Dobbies Dalgety Bay or Livingston. The pianist in the café at lunchtime was amazing! Don't know if he's always there or if this was just a special occasion. 
3160,"There is an accessible toilet just as you come in. I was told they are working to get this up to code (it does not have a red cord/ alarm and is quite small) and are in talks to knock it in and build a bigger toilet at the other end of the hall. You’d need to move the nappy bin under the sink to transfer, there were some grab rails and the sink was at a good height. There is not really space for a wheelchair and a carer and no turning space. I look forward to seeing this updated. 
In the coffee bar which is currently not ideal for wheelchair access they have a new disabled toilet. "
3161,"The nearest tube stations to the hospital are Euston Square, which is only step free westbound, and Warren Street. The nearest step free station is King's Cross. There are also several buses that stop outside the hospital entrance on Euston Road.  "
3162,Large car park which is shared by two other hotels in the group. Barrier entry due to the shopping center (which charges for parking) next door. Disabled spaces next to entrance.
3163,The exhibitions are contemporary and the space is interesting
3164,"We stayed with friends at this Best Western hotel. It is an older building that has had some bedrooms made accessible.  These rooms are accessed from outside. Our room was the furthest from reception which meant we got soaked getting to breakfast.  We were told to ask for room 214 if we were going back as its closest to the reception.  The bedroom is quite spacious but we couldn't get a wheelchair down either side of the bed so my husband had to move the bed. There were no alarm buttons in the bedroom or bathroom. The bathroom is great with grab rails and roll in shower with shower chair. Only complaint is if you're in a wheelchair you cannot see in the mirror! 
The restaurant is spacious . There's 2 levels one down a few steps but plenty of room on the main level. Staff were very helpful moving chairs for me. The restaurant has a lovely view of the river but unfortunately we could hardly see anything because of the rain! 
Theres 3 disabled parking spaces near reception and a couple at the courtyard outside the disabled rooms. "
3165,Transportation made very easy with fully equipped lift access coach.
3166,"Advertised as 'accessible'.
See below"
3167,"Couldn't fault it! We were very apprehensive beforehand as hadn't travelled that route on a match day before. We went via Glasgow Central and then Mount Florida. Helpful staff at each point. On way back the mounted police directed us to the accessible entrance to Mount Florida station (which also meant we skipped the queue - hurrah!). From Mount Florida it's only a short distance to Hampden. 

Re parking - a pal always travels by car and there is a decent sized blue badge car park at Hampden."
3168,"This property has two bathrooms, one ensuite to the twin bedded room and a family bathroom. Full access aids for the toilet are provided in both bathrooms"
3169,Very friendly and helpful.
3170,"Absolutely Fantastic holiday, nothing was to much trouble for the staff and they think of every detail, from Hot chocolate on the lake under cover due to the rain to certificates at the end  with personal messages on them, Thank you all so very much"
3171,"Those of us with memories of how The Astoria was before the refurbishment all agree it is now so much better. Warm. Comfy seats. But it could be so much better.

In the screens I've been to - 3 and 5 - the sound is much better. But the sound proofing is in adequate. Recently whilst watching Mary Poppins Returns there was a constant rumble from an adjoining screen showing some block buster.

Then let's talk about accessibility. Screens 3, 4 and 5 are accessible. They are not on ground level. But there is a wheelchair lift to take you down the equivalent of 10 steps. So far so good. But be warned, it is quite a walk to a disabled toilet on this lower level.

I first visited in November and refurbishment was still on going in the two upstairs screens. I assumed that to comply with accessibility requirements Reel would put in a lift to upstairs. Wrong! The two upstairs screens can only be accessed via the stairs. No good for me. (Ambulant disabled) Let alone someone in a wheelchair 

I queried this when I visited. The young guy on duty was clearly embarrassed. ""I'm sorry sir. All I can suggest is you contact us beforehand and we'll let you know if the screen is accessible.""

Such a pity. 

It's great that Reel cinemas have spent money on the Astoria. But its not a ""proper job"""
3172,parking spaces available outside in denmark street - if you have blue badge there are often spaces on yellow lines
3173,"Attentive, obliging, friendly and helpful"
3174,Very friendly.
3175,"We stayed in the Massney Lodge it was home from home, fully equipped for every need and very clean couldn't of asked for more. Was very calming and relaxing daily walks along the beach done us all the world of good."
3176,see pic
3177,They lose a star because they closed all of the lifts during refurbishment. 
3178,"Good spacious place, with good service and good access"
3179,"I believe there is a disabled loo on the ground floor, however I didn't use it so can't provide any detail."
3180,The staff I spoke to were very helpful and offered physical help to get me up to the area for mobility scooters. They came and asked if we needed any other help twice during the performance.
3181,"Very good. A staff member is by the front door and opens it for you as arrive then hands you a guide to the museum. The first thing you see is £1 million! There are large print and audio guides, and there are magnifiers beside some exhibits. Quite a few interactive activities too!"
3182,Great roomy restaurant.  No problem moving about with a wheelchair or scooter or if a person uses sticks or crutches. Tables are a good height and staff are helpful and will move chairs etc to give space for wheelchair user to sit at the table.  Good facilities for young children as well. Excellent and cheerful service.
3183,Friendly but could be better
3184,The doors are manually operated but the space is wide enough for my electric chair
3185,Magical
3186,Not sure if there is public transport - it is quite rural. If you drive there's a large car park with plenty of disabled parking spaces near the door. 
3187,Very friendly staff. Security stewards also endured no one wandered into our area to misuse the space that was allocated to disabled guests during the concert.
3188,"Large wet rooms ,plenty of space. Only 4 because the grab rails are the temporary ones currently but they were firm hold. Sliding doors go away completely so clear access into bathrooms."
3189,"Not on a bus route, a large sloping carpark with no Blue Badge space"
3190,"There is a public disabled toilet for you, close to reception entry, very clean and nicely tiled out, with grab rail, and if you have to, you could get a wheelchair inside."
3191,There was a rear automatic door near the toilets but I couldn' t see the way in through the fenceline for this.
3192,"Parking is great, plenty of room to park either right by the door, or in the shared car park, with easy access"
3193,"Needed to drive chair through narrow area to get to disabled toilet, this was in the ladies toilet. No running water in sink or soap. Had to use main sink and had to pull hand soap off from holder on wall to use it as it was up to high and i would not have been able to use the hand push pump on top. "
3194,Disabled parking is limited in Bath City centre and central car parks are expensive.  This is the cheapest and easiest way to visit even with a wheelchair.   Kneeling buses with a drop down ramp at car park venue and raised kerbs at City centre stops for level access.  Buses approx every 10-15 mins.  3 Park & ride locations.
3195,"The building is fully accessible on ground floor level, with no steps and a ramp to the side for wheelchairs/pushchairs.  The doors leading into the building are automatic. There was excellent signage guiding customers to the café and toilet facilities, also the in store customer services desk, there were staff on hand for assistance if required.  In the café there was an induction loop clearly indicated at the café till, there are disabled priority seating at a couple of tables in the café, with sufficient space, these are located close to the till area and leading to the main Foodhall shopping area."
3196,"If you go around the back, you can go to the pub garden. I don't know if you can go inside because I didn't investigate further. After I was told that the disabled toilet was not accessible for wheelchair"
3197,"Two toilet complexes you can use, one has a lift to upper level, but a small disabled toilet can be used just behind the lift on the ground floor, as shown on this part of our review.



"
3198,There was a disabled toilet signposted but I did not use it
3199,Large and functional. Nearby the 'standard' toilets are minimal so there tends to be a problem with non-disabled people using the accessible loo
3200,Parking was available within yards of accommodation. 
3201,"There is a parking area located outside the Library, but this appears to only allow for 2 - 3 cars. There is a small driveway area in front of the library which allows for drop off and pick up directly outside the library entrance. There are several car parks located in close proximity to the library, as well as off road parking."
3202,Staff helpful but no knowledge of hearing loops.
3203,"Other than the courtyard, access around Linlithgow Palace by its very nature is not easy. There are handles up all of the stone spiral staircases, but these are big, steep steps of varying heights and condition. Some of the cellars are pitch black with dim lighting for safety, but it won't be suitable for everybody. 

Inside the rooms and the corridors however the smooth stone paving is very welcome! I didn't feel like I was going to trip in the dark at any point which was reassuring.

The courtyard is worth a visit however! The ornate fountain in the middle is amazing, and they used to fill it with wine during royal parties. There are lots of information boards around the courtyard and helpful staff to answer any questions about the site."
3204,"The Zoo has space to accommodate around 850 cars and individuals with a disability ID card can park for free all day. The cost is normally CZK 200 which is the equivalent of £7 for all day. The buses are all wheelchair friendly as they have a manual fold out ramp at the centre door. The 112 bus goes straight to the zoo which leaves Nádraží Holešovice metro station, 2/3 of the metro stations are wheelchair accessible including this one. However, most metro stations have 2 or 3 entrances and not every entrance has a lift down to the metros. "
3205,The disabled parking is relatively suitable.
3206,"This review was written after attending the private preview of Smoke and Mirrors: The Psychology of Magic, the new Wellcome Collection exhibition which is on until 15 September 2019.
The exhibition explores  psychology and magical entertainment. It's fascinating and strongly recommend visiting. Wellcome Collection was Euan's Guide's venue of the Year 2018 so there's excellent access."
3207,There is blue badge parking at the stadium and there was a very large section held back for blue badge holders.
3208,Step free from street. Through coffee shop and to the left and at the end of the toilet corridor.
3209,Other than being very busy and being tired by sigh we got on asking for help with the tray. Two staff members working on a very busy day is not good enough. I give the low score because she gave a sigh and told us to maybe come back on a day they were not busy. Not happy it made us feel that the disabled should not go on a Saturday as it’s to busy and we are to slow.
3210,"The new visitor centre is fantastic! Accessible parking right outside, wide smooth pathways up to the front door which opens automatically. The centre is bright, and you are greeted with the most friendly welcome by somebody at reception. This is where you book tickets for the Kelpie tour which is itself wheelchair accessible. Inside the visitor centre there is a brilliant space which kids and adults alike will love. It has low, moveable benches in front of a video screen, fascinating illustrations all at low level, desks to play with lego and a drawing table (again at a great height for wheelchair users). The cafe inside the building has plenty of tables with removable chairs too. Just great."
3211,There are only disabled loos beyond the ticket barriers. 
3212,"There are several accessible wet rooms available for people who need to use them.

There is also a separate room available with a mobile hoist and large changing bench available for those who need it.

They also have a working pool hoist. "
3213,The venue at the top of the site is very good with disabled parking but if you want to navigate the park be warned the paths are steep for wheelchairs and some mobility scooters. Access to the shop can be difficult if you are alone through e narrow doors space
3214,"There is accessible toilets around the hotel and in the spa area, there is also an accessible toilet in the building across the car park (i think it was for the marina)"
3215,"As mentioned above, staff ignored the doorbell and I waited outside for several minutes. The person who eventually brought the ramp to me told me that he wasn't at all surprised that the staff didn't hear the doorbell, as they never (in his opinion) pay any attention to it. This one-star rating for staff is on the generous side."
3216,Well catered for with ready access to the one from the master bedroom.
3217,Maybe difficult to understand for those with special needs etc.
3218,"There is a disabled toilet on the ground level .
 In order to access the toilets and you must use the  radar key scheme .  See photo .
 It is wheelchair accessible and very spacious . See photo .
 There is an emergency right cord"
3219,"Average, not exceptional. Easy to get in the coffee shop because besides the door there is a button where you can push for the door to open. Once inside, like most coffee shops it can be pretty tight in order to maneuver your wheelchair/mobility scooter.
Another slight negative I would say would be like most coffee shops it can be quite a noisy place which is something to bear in mind if you're hard of hearing.  "
3220,There is no entrance where it is easy for most wheelchair users to get in or out. There is no accessible toilet. Not recommended for wheelchair users unless you're a manual wheelchair user with the ability to bounce energetically over big hump-steps.
3221,Lift to rooms. Bed was a little too low for us and the thick carpet made it very difficult to move around on a wheelchair. Ok for an overnight stop. 
3222,"To enter the grounds of the villa there is no Disabled access as there is only a set of steps. Therefore, wheelchair uses would have a great deal of difficulty entering the property.  once you have got passed the steps the ground floor is open plan so our grandmother stayed on the that floor as she has a decreased mobility. However, in relation to disabled access the company who rent out the property states that the villa does not includes disabled access on their website.
"
3223,"A few disabled bays available on George Street. 

Central location means it will be connected to local bus and tram route."
3224,"There is a ramp into main entrance. Reception desk has a lowered section and there is a wider barrier for wheelchairs. 

There was mesh on the grass too which would aid in wheelchair access.
 
Hearing loop signs were also spotted. I didn't see any braille signs. 

They have sunflower lanyards for those with invisible disabilities."
3225,"Parking in site has the main behind house in courtyard with disabled next to disabled room, and if that fills up, outside entrance to main building is generic parking. So if you have no power issues, lots of space. "
3226,"I came here for a classic car event in their field at the back. It was a tight squeeze getting around the terrace and it took me a while to find a door I could get in. The corridors were a squeeze and it was difficult for people to get past me trying to get the other way.

I tried to get to the toilet. There were small single steps up which I could manage in my rigid manual chair (other chairs might not manage and it was probably too narrow for many chairs) but I couldn't find an accessible toilet. When I asked, one member of staff said he didn't think there was one and had to ask another member of staff, who they said they didn't have one and apologised but sounded almost like they hadn't even thought of it before.

On the way back out I found it difficult to drop down the little stepped bits I had gone up on because it was too narrow to control my wheels properly and I needed to go down in a wheelie (and now there was someone behind me so I couldn't reverse up the corridor to turn around to go down backwards).

There was maybe one room that I could have got around. Everywhere else was a tight squeeze.

I decided not to have a drink there as I didn't feel like I was welcome (and I was still desperate for the toilet!). Instead, I wheeled all the way out the village to another pub, which was accessible and used the toilet and had a drink there, which meant I missed lots of the event at The Swan.

I won't be going back to this pub."
3227,There is a pristine accessible loo which is located in the hotel lobby next to the bar. It is accessed through the door to the left of the bar. It is a good size and would accommodate all wheelchairs. It also has a baby changing facility. 
3228,"Lots of wheelchair accessible buses pass by the gardens, although if you're looking for the most level access entrance, get a bus to Lothian Road and enter the garden via King's Stables Road. There is a multi-storey car park right beside the King's Stables Road entrance and lots of on street parking too. "
3229,Buses and trams stop in the vicinity but it will involve a short walk. 
3230,"6 steps into the building at 9 Howe Street, no means of alerting staff of need for assistance unless you can get up the steps (or if you have can use a mobile phone and already know the phone number).  Main toilet includes 2 cubicles, of which 1 has grab rails.  More individual cubicles down a flight of stairs, but lighting is variable.

Garden can be reached via cobbled street and one step, but no toilet facilities.

Activities sometimes held at wheelchair accessible venues around the city, but acoustics can result in too much noise (writing as someone who can become distressed by noise and other sensory stimulation)."
3231,"Could only access half the inside and outside areas and even then had to take a different and longer route than the able bodied.
Access to the gardens and park was via a long route round the perimeter with some fairly steep slopes and had to phone for a code to open a gate. If you go there write the code down as you will need it to get out again and the phone number is only displayed on the outside. 
There is no disabled access to the water gardens. Paths are gravel and very hard going in places.
To access the family pleasure gardens for disabled visitors you have to go back to your car and drive there. As I had arrived by coach I couldn't get there at all. 
On the plus side there are mobility scooters and wheelchairs available for hire free of charge but you cannot take the hired scooters into any of the indoor areas. The staff were very pleasant and helpful if you could find them.
"
3232,Staff are exceptionally helpful.
3233,"The accessible toilets are a short distance in a different car park, there are no changing places facilities, but there are grab rails and it is fairly large in size. It isn't in the accessible car park, but it is by closely to drive to."
3234,"The Victoria Hotel Function Room is open for special events only. It does have step free access from the street to the main room. It also has adequate disabled toilets. The ramp to the venue is not very steep and not very long, there is also plenty of room to maneuver when traveling down it. The normal staff often don't work for the events except the bar but they are normally very pleasant and helpful. The bar is quite high up so it would be hard for anyone that is in a wheelchair. All the event staff that I have seen working there are very helpful and friendly and often do whatever they can. "
3235,"We stayed in this hotel for a few nights . I cannot comment on the value for money since I did not book it. The hotel was nice enough- it was clearly aimed at an elderly audience. The front doors was not ideal with a wheelchair however there were often enough people around to help out. The lift was a bit on the small side so required some skill to get into with a larger wheelchair. The hoist in the bedroom worked suitability , with the housekeeping kindly moving to the charging point when we forgot. However the hoist was just a single track from the bed to the bathroom making it not the easiest to get from the bed to the wheelchair without moving the bed mid process. The food was okay , nothing to rave about. Slightly disappointedly when we asked a member of staff about the best way up the Great Orme with a wheelchair and the suggestion was to get the tram......which we had previously  researched and it does not carry wheelchairs unless they fold. However was in a good location of right next to the sea with great views from the dining room.  It appeared the hotel offered a lot of day trips and evening entertainment bingo etc , which we did not personally do however I am sure others will have enjoyed."
3236,"Throughout the village there is amply space for you to get around, even though it can be really full at times. There are no steps, it’s all flat and easy to get around, and we certainly saw everything. Plenty of seating areas for tired legs and heavy bags."
3237,No staff anywhere while we were there. 
3238,"Good access, lovely staff, and just enough space to move around the shop comfortably. Full marks!"
3239,"Clean & tidy,  roomy, but had to move bins to manoeuvre my chair around
Red cord down to floor, Euan’s Guide red cord card already in situ.
If you are visiting the café after the museum, and need the loo, then try and go before you go to the café, as no loo in the café, and you have to go back round the museum to access the loo.
"
3240,"The doors into the museum are electric, the whole area is wide and flat, with lifts to other floors. There is plenty of space everywhere."
3241,"Fully accessible, we loved it as did the kids!"
3242,"There are 9 Blue badge spaces located to the right hand side of the main entrance to the store. I would have given 5 stars but there has been a number of problems with parking . People have been given a ticket because the badge was upside down as an example.
The main public transport links are out on the South Circular Road this is some distance away."
3243,Staff were very helpful and friendly.
3244,We parked in a nearby side street
3245,Access to exhibits and restaurant good but only non accessibility to aircraft as up steps
3246,There  is on street parking in the Grassmarket a few meters  from the door but it can get very busy.  Lothian buses have an accessible service that runs along the main road; as do some of the accessible tourist buses.
3247,"The Card Factory is generally accessible throughout. No bell on the door but it is usually open, except in winter. Level entrance. No induction hearing loop and no Braille support. Can bring a chair out on request. Door width 1000mm, till height 720mm or 960mm"
3248,The Underbelly is a wheelchair accessible theatre with well organised support set within the equally accessible George Square Gardens. Only minor drawbacks a cobbled street to cross to get there and poorly designed doorway on the accessible loos.
3249,"The palace is in the city centre. There are a number of buses that stop nearby. The metro and buses in Copenhagen have designated spaces for wheelchair users. Their website says that ""Disabled parking space is available at the Bertel Thorvaldsen Plads (by the entrance to the Thorvaldsen Museum)."""
3250,Easy enough to find from the motorway.
3251,Wetroom bathroom with one grabrail by showewr and one by toilet. Owners will lend seat raiser and shower seat. Full access statement with measurements on owners' website.
3252,"There is a lift, ramps, including into interactive areas and displays. There are foldable seats you can borrow too."
3253,Parking is fine but there is a step into the ccable-car station at the bottom only. There is plenty of space in the cable-car for a wheelchair.
3254,"I loved everything about Gladstone's Library. It's amazing in every way. It was the perfect place to visit, it really uplifted and nurtured my mind and soul. The building and location are beautiful and also very accessible. The Theology Room, is gorgeous, it's like being a guest in a personal library of someone who lives in a gothic castle, and as a resident you get a fab which gives you access to the library till 10pm. the restaurant is open 8am to 8pm, and the food is outstandingly good. A continental breakfast is included in the room rate and you can pay a little extra for cooked food. Then the restaurant is open throughout the day for lunch, cakes and dinner. The menu included vegetarian and vegan dishes, and they use locally sourced foods. The quality of the food is exceptional. It's a good place to come to recharge your batteries.

This is a residential library, it's not stuffy and the place and location would be good even if didn't primarily want to use the library's facilities. You could use it as a base to explore North Wales, with good accessible accommodation and a lovely restaurant, with a varied menu, or equally you could just stay on site for your entire visit. This is a place you'd like if you want a quite, peaceful, relaxing holiday.  Hawarden is a small village in North Wales, with a couple of pubs, post office and a couple of shops. "
3255,Always helpful and freindly
3256,"An accessible toilet by the reception and a large wetroom (with grab rails by the toilet, shower and sinks) in the private room."
3257,Has large car-park with at least two spaces for disabled. Rather remote site so little in way of public transport.
3258,Staff are incredibly friendly & helpful.
3259,Great restaurant hidden away by the river in Farndon. Excellent food not to pricey with early eater menus.
3260,"The entrance in step free and the door is wide, it is easy to get in and out. We sat in the window, the table was at a good height. There was room for me to get to the till. "
3261,In the centre of town with a car park 5 minutes away. The car park has 4 disabled spaces and allows free parking for 3 hours if you have a blue badge
3262,I phoned first and staff at the hill to the esplanade moved barriers to enable us to drive on to the esplanade and we were able to park right beside the entrance. There is a mobility car which I drove my scooter into. It took my husband and me to the highest point in the Castle. Staff were brilliant and so friendly and helpful.
3263,"Accomodation, grounds and pool wonderful. A very peaceful place. Children really enjoyed it. Only thing to let it down from 5* was the playbarn... We would definitely return next year if the playbarn work has been carried out. The owners were wonderful and very understanding and all visitors were lovely to talk to. Well worth a visit if you are like us and unable to stay anywhere mainstream."
3264,"There is a ramp so that Wheelchair users can access Barn at Beal.
See photo
Inside it is spacious and has plenty of different seating arrangements.
See photo
"
3265,Parking on Leith Walk and side streets. Taxi can park right outside. Loads of buses to Albert Place.
3266,The staff seemed generally pleasant and helpful.
3267,"There's a woodland walk from the car park (charge payable) down to the viewpoint.  Crossing the road from the car park requires a bit of help as there's no dropped kerb on the far side and no crossing (so care needed spotting cars, which travel quite fast on this section of road). There's a bit of a bump in the first bit of path, but after that it's a gentle trundle on firm paths more or less all the way down - only the very last short section is inaccessible (steps). Spectacular waterfall. Charges apply - buy tickets in ticket office in car park."
3268,"I entered easily on my disabled scooter and received a warm welcome. Good home cooking, plenty of space for wheelchair/scooter, stunning views over countryside to River Tay.  I enjoyed watching the geese, ducks and hens outside the large windows. Good Farm Shop, local and organic food for sale, craft gifts too. Accessible disabled toilet. I cannot recommend Jamesfield enough. I have also visited with my local MS Society group, easily accommodated for a meal. There is an accessible Garden Centre on the same site. Large car park.  A good outing all roundD"
3269,Really accessible venue with really helpful staff that answered any access related questions I had.  The arena also has its own dedicated accessible line for any tickets enquires.   
3270,Very friendly helpful staff
3271,Once by the main entrance there is a ramp to go up. It's concrete and has a hand rail. It may be a little steep for some wheelchair users and they may need a 'push'. A large doorway leads in to the foyer from where you have level access to the main areas. There are some doors and these are wide enough to pass through with a powerchair. There's a shop and information area as well as light refreshments.
3272,friendly and helpful though was a busy lunchtime
3273,"the route to the venue was very easily accessed by the whole party there were no major lips or curbs that we had trouble with, both manual and electric chair users fitted through and used the doors we used to exit and enter the venue without needing additional ramps or supports, it was great to know staff were on hand if we really needed their help "
3274,"I parked 5 minutes away in Monk Bar car park which boasts 40 disabled bays.
There is a cobbled surface outside the restaurant."
3275,Access into the museum was excellent through automated large doors and we were able to visit all areas of the museum. Lifts were available to gain access to upper floors. Only one set of doors in the museum proved slightly difficult.
3276,"Access in this shop is good. There are two main entrances, both are level and step-free. They aren't automatic doors however, but they are glass so staff should be able to see you approaching if you do need assistance. Inside there are moveable chairs and enough space to move around comfortably."
3277,"Parked in Southgate underground car park, less than 5 minutes walk. Easily accessed via lift"
3278,"Nice roomy pub. I was in on a Sunday afternoon to watch the football, it was fairly quiet. I can imagine, especially at weekend nights that the place could get very busy with students.
"
3279,"It was great to try out the adapted ski-ing at SnowFactor in Braehead Shopping Centre. Being a huge sports fan I was eager to try it out as I never thought it would be possible. It’s fast, fun and provides you with an adrenaline rush making you want to go faster each ski-run. 

Having different options for different abilities was fantastic, I got to try out the mono-ski which  allows you to be completely independent as well as try out the tethered 
assisted option. I’d recommend it to anyone looking to get into adaptive snow sports, or try something new.    "
3280,Good
3281,Very easy to find. I had left my mobility scooter outside and had walked in so I couldn't really tell how easy it would be to manouevre but there seemed to be enough space and the toilet was spotlessly clean.
3282,Venturing in to the building for the first time I found the wheelchair access to be really good. An automated door opens to let you in and once inside you can enjoy the offerings of the cafe or venture further in by using the ramped access. There are several lifts to take you to the various levels and all are spacious and easily accommodated my powerchair. The different areas of the building were accessible and offered a range of views out to the river. There were even accessible terraces where you could sit outside and enjoy the views. The signage was good and it was easy to move around.
3283,"There is an accessible toilet to the rear of the coffee shop. Unusually it does not require a code to access it. Inside it is reasonably spacious with grab rails. The emergency code did not reach to the floor as it appears to have been cut. The room was clean.

Most concerning was the low level of lighting. The main light was not working and there interior room was only illuminated by a single, small bulb. I found the room very dark to be in and for people who have visual impairment it could potentially be dangerous. This is why I have given the toilet such a low score.

"
3284,"the room was on ground floor in court yard being in a wheel chair was quite difficult to get in room as had a high step had to get out of wheel chair and my husband had to help me up step, couldn't use the wheelchair in room , the room service was very quick and with a smile , breakfast in the morning was lovely plenty of room for my chair ."
3285,Main entrance has electric sliding doors and a lift to rooms. 
3286,You can park in the high st car park but there are no wide spaces.   However it is free for blue badge holders .The High Street itself as a disabled bay right outside the restaurant but if you are a rear ramp user like I am you'll find it difficult to get the ramp down and onto the pavement
3287,I didnt use it but it was accessible and there were volunteers to help if needed I am sure this could have been requested on Welcome as well if they knew you were coming.
3288,"Fabulous, couldn’t have been more friendly or helpful."
3289,Good.
3290,"The signage was good, there was an audio guide with volume control but no hearing loop system"
3291,Toilet was fine but the door was too heavy to open on my own. No red cord!
3292,"Level access into pub and lots of seating to choose from. During the day it was light and airy but at night it can be quite stuffy, dark and hard to move around. Signage is really good. There is a garden area but I did not go through that way so cannot comment on access."
3293,"Once through the Holyrood-style security (indoors), an attendant escorts out into the open and over to a ground floor outdoor entrance to a capacious lift, which takes you up to the level of the roof terrace. There are wonderful views from the roof terrace, all of which is fully accessible, and from there it's an easy push up the spiral walkway inside the Norman Foster glass dome. We saw some wheelchair users self-propelling up the walkway with apparent ease.  From the top there are great views of the city, & you can also look down into the chamber of the Bundestag (German Federal Parliament)."
3294,Staff were very helpful. The staffing levels were not their fault but meant they were overstretched.
3295,The staff in the cafe were very helpful and friendly. I was with a friend who walks with a stick and the young members of staff twice carried a tray over for us and went and found us cutlery and a jug of iced water.
3296,"The young keeper who attended as a first responder/first aider, was very well meaning, but not well trained or equipped to respond to an accident of this type with a disabled older person. He was advising we go to hospital, as he wasn't able to really respond or check for serious secondary impacts of the fall and did not ask about my mothers existing health or conditions. He took name and address but no other details. He was not working to any policy guidelines that meant that the response provided was prioritised over other issues that were happening in the zoo at the time of the accident. So my Mum had to get back in her wheelchair very shaken. The Zoo has acknowledged this will be looked at. No one came to meet my Mum, no one got her a cup of tea, no one got more senior advice or took time to report the incident or interview my mum on what had happened to her either, before we left the site to go to hospital or after the event. I have just got the impression they wanted to play the whole incident down. "" Oh your responding very well now, it is a shock, oh we can't do any more with those wounds etc, .."" they gave a number for the hospital and I took her. I did speak to the duty manager myself later when we returned to pick up the rest of the family, she assured me this would be treated as a serious incident, but so far I have not had that demonstrated in terms of the response provided. If this changes - I will update this review."
3297,Access to the store is from Hanover Street where there are steps or George Street where there is a ramp and automated doors. A lift is available to take people to the lower floor. There is space to easily move around and most goods are visible from wheelchair height.
3298,"The access was terrific just like everything else! I forgot to mention that the weather was fantastic so the grass was dry and easy to move on, I presume that if it was raining then it would of been harder to move on the grass. There was a lift from ground level to the restaurant. They have a number of raised wheelchair platforms around the track and Parade Ring for easy viewing. "
3299,Very good bathroom which suited my needs very well. It may be worth bringing your shower chair depending on your needs.
3300,"The Amber room is located within a listed building however they have made the process of getting there so seamless. As I entered the Scotch Whisky Experience, turn right and go long or short corridor to the lift. Go to floor -1 and in the morning you will experience the glorious scent of coffee."
3301,"The staff are always really friendly and they can never do enough to help you! Iv'e never had a problem with any of them, even now when I have to interact with them a bit more."
3302,"There is accessible parking bays at the rear entrance (off Bonnington road). There are only two spaces and are really quite tight to drive into due to the pillars holding up the ceiling of car park. The spaces are very close to the entrance and under cover, which is a real bonus."
3303,2 accessible toilets  available
3304,"There is a public toilet for you, plain and simple, but very clean with basic facilities. It had grab rails and pull cord, and you can just about spin in there."
3305,"All coaches are extremely well trained in wheelchair tennis, and could not have been more helpful or supportive. The staff inside the clubhouse were also extremely helpful and very happy - a really positive vibe between all the staff and visitors."
3306,There is a lift to get to the first level. 
3307,"The main restaurant is very busy so I'd recommend going to the smaller cafe at the back. It's wheelchair friendly, spacious and there's different seating options and outdoor seating which is accessible.
There's soya milk and a selection of gluten free cakes which are yummy.
Staff are helpful, friendly and knowledgable on allergy information.
There is a steep ramp up to the restaurant/café but there is an accessible route.
There are wheelchairs and mobility scooters to hire.
The garden bit is spacious and has accessible routes but the gift shop area can be a bit narrow to fit my wheelchair around in places.
There's plenty to look at in the shop area to have a nice browse around from gift to yarn to candles.
Even on a rainy day it's a nice place to visit.
There's a children's play area outside."
3308,"100 spots, however all were taken so arrive early! (Blue badge only)."
3309,The accessible toilet is in a good position and a decent size.
3310,"A fully accessible, friendly, welcoming place for wheelchair users. An excellent modern accessible toilet with a couple of really annoying, avoidable problems - see below and see my photo)."
3311,"Generally, a very positive experience at this venue, let down only by some very heavy doors & no raised viewing area."
3312,"Good food, staff friendly, shame the accessible toilet is uses as a storage facility for beer kegs, a hoover, boxes and clothes."
3313,The door to get in is not automatic and quite heavy to push on your own. In better weather I believe it is kept open. It is all on one level and there are no steps or ramps inside. There are some low softer seats to relax in or regular dining chairs and tables to sit at. There are a lot of seats on the restaurant floor so it can get crowded and difficult to maneovre when the place is busy.
3314,Flat entrance to  both buildings but small lip on entrance to cafe building.  Everywhere is wheelchair accessible 
3315,"Accessible toilet very easy to find. Plenty of room for carers/manoeuvring with chairs. Pull down grab rails next to toilet. Tap may be awkward to use due to small button rather than handle. Well lit, clean, and tidy."
3316,"It was easy to find and there were two in the theatre, both of which were in use while we were there. Fortunately, the REP is attached to Birmingham Central Library, which has multiple accessible toilets.

We have since visited this location again, and discovered that although there are 2 accessible toilets, theatre policy is for some reason to lock one of them after the performance has finished. Although this does cause problems, the downstairs toilet remains open (RADAR key only).

It is also worth mentioning that Birmingham Central Library closes in the evening, meaning that their toilets are only accessible during and after a matinee performance."
3317,"Restaurant is on first floor, accessible by lift."
3318,Bang opposite the station and next to the bus stops so we were very happy. The bus stop we came in on was one of the accessible style where the pavement was raised so no having to deploy ramps which was a bonus!
3319,No step access. Tables with movable chairs . Lots of space .
3320,Very large and easy to manoeuvre around toilets with all necessary adjustments
3321,The car park was good but a bit steep to get the wheelchair out.
3322,Always found staff very friendly in Braehead. Especially the mobility staff members.
3323,Very friendly and helpful 
3324,"Confused as the food was 5 star but my experience was not.
I use crutches or a wheelchair and was so glad I was using my crutches. On arrival the   Table was not ready and we were told to take a seat at the bar - high stools not too suitable for the disabled. Table was ready and was down a flight of stairs.Once down (thankfully there we folk in our group to assist) I enquired as to the location of the disabled toilet and you’ve guessed it, it was up the stairs! Or I could use a normal cubicle.
Great meal, service and experience for the able bodied not so much for the disabled making me really confused."
3325,"Firstly, there's a discount for Blue Badge holders, our flexible ticket cost less than my parents' non-flexible ticket as we booked using my Blue Badge.  We missed the information telling us to book a space near the lift for a wheelchair, but all the staff were extremely helpful when we got there, ensuring we had an accessible space near the lift on both crossings.  Half a star is lost purely because they're working with a ferry that wasn't designed to be accessible.  Every single staff member works hard to make accessible journeys as easy and pleasant as possible."
3326,"I used the one near the museum cafe and it was OK. I'm never that thrilled to have to share with a baby changing facility, but it was easy to find, reasonably clean and big enough to fit my scooter inside. One of the rails was a bit loose, though - could provide a hairy moment for a future user."
3327,"The staff were initially very friendly but this changed, regretfully, when they realised the obvious problems and therefore were not able to assist. The staff serving 'coffee and cakes' were lovely."
3328,"Plenty of loos since the refurb. Roomy, clean and unisex. 
"
3329,"There are lots of portaloos, including accessible ones.

There was also a MobiLoo - which I had never seen before. It looks like a small van and on the side it says 'a vehicle for change.' Inside is a full accessible bathroom, complete with changing plinth and hoist. It has ramp access, and a member of staff is there to help if required.

The information in the events brochure lists where there are permanent changing places toilets, nearby in the city."
3330,Very polite and helpful.
3331,Accessible loo at reception. Not at the house but big enough to manage with help.
3332,"Being in the center of Glasgow means there is good transport links. Buses, trains and subway [inaccessible for wheelchairs] are all close by.
There are disabled parking bays in St. Vincent Place about 100 yards away.
"
3333,"I took my five year old daughter who is a full time wheelchair user and my friend brought her five year old daughter who uses a walking frame.
Both adults gained entry with our children’s blue badges free of charge as their carers. Which was a welcome bonus.
After spending fifteen minutes waiting for entry with the next tour and explanation about how Lego is made. (No other way in) 
We arrived at the first ride to find it completely inaccessible and a member of staff told us we had to go all around the complex to the front desk where we had just paid to show the blue badges we had just shown to enter to acquire a pass to gain access to the rides. Two very bored five year olds looking at all the other children passing them and going on the rides at this point. 
I asked why it wasn’t done when we paid and why can’t someone just allow the children on a ride and a staff member bring us the passes. That would be positively discriminatory ifwe give you the passes before seeing proof that the children are disabled. A child in a big adapted wheelchair and a child using a walking frame and the receipts from gaining access as carers were obviously not enough.
After that hiccup 🙄 the rest of the day was brilliant. The staff put the girls on first on al the rides and even one where they would’ve had to use their feet to press peddles in a police car they even had a special police car the staff pushed them around the track in.
We didn’t have any problem getting around anywhere even with the mobility equipment (apart from a metal crunching crash when the girls collided while racing down a slope in the Trafford centre afterward lol
I had taken my daughter to the changing places toilet at the Trafford centre on the way in as I didn’t know they had one inside Legoland so I cannot comment on the cp facility.
But a great stress free (apart from the ride pass issue) day and lovely helpful staff."
3334,Great! The majority of the site is step free and where there were steps there was a ramp for an alternative route. We only visited the exterior of the grounds as it was nearly closing time when we arrived. You can get right alongside the reflection pools which is lined in one side with the Wall of the Missing. Some of the paths have a fine gravel on them and the graves themselves are on grass which might be tricky for some people. Graves are organised alphabetically with clear signage.
3335,Loads better than it used to be! The new lifts to take you from and to Princes Street are a big improvement!
3336,If you book the Family Suits you have your own entrance which has a ramp - path a bit broken up however effort has been made to create easy access so you can park up close to edge of ramp and wheel straight into apartment
3337,"Entrance to the train station is via one of three entrances. The main entrance is beside the car park, where there are several accessible car parking spaces for blue badge holders. There is a drop off/pick up area adjacent to the door of the ticket office. "
3338,Vikingar can be accessed using car bus or train. I have used the car and the train The train station is a fair distance to walk but there are disabled parking spaces at the front of the centre.
3339,"The Glasgow Clan (previously called Braehead Clan) are Glasgow professional ice-hockey team.

Their home is at the rink in Braehead Arena. 

It's an exciting game to watch... and you can follow the basics even if you've never been before. 
Suitable for the whole family. "
3340,Staff were friendly and helpful
3341,"All on one level, no ramps stairs or lifts needed."
3342,"The main entrance to the railway station is suitable for the use of wheelchairs as it is completely flat. Throughout the station there are numerous lifts which allow access to all platforms therefore not causing any issues. However, to the rear of the station there are no lifts available which means the popular National Railway Museum cannot be accessed via this route."
3343,My first sit ski lesson was an incredible experience. I am already booking my next session! Fantastic day out for people with disabilities with supportive staff and fantastic adapted ski equipment. 
3344,Toilets are at the back of the shop part. There is a sign to the disabled toilet. There are grab rails by the toilet and sink and one on the back of the door. It is large enough for a wheelchair and a carer. It was reasonably clean and tidy.
3345,The staff were alright. They weren't helpful or unhelpful.
3346,"Couldn't get in because of a small step, so unfortunately can't comment. "
3347,Three spaces in the car park 20 minute parking in street unlimited for blue badge holders. Well places for bus station and railway station. 
3348,Staff were rude and unfriendly 
3349,"Great. All ramps integral, didn’t feel like a second class citizen once. Ramps to the patios, the bars, the beach, the sea....
However... some very rough surfaces, bumpy paving quite uncomfortable to drive on, don’t put any more of that down please!  Also got very lost looking for one restaurant and kept finding steps everywhere I went, however there was a step free route and got rescued by staff in the end !"
3350,Staff were more than helpful and understanding of disabled needs
3351,There were automatic doors and seating provided at every level. The directions of the museum are in large print.
3352,"Arriving from Belvedere Road, in the evening, it was not clear where the entrance was. There are lifts to all floors, however the signage is not clear and I had to ask a member of staff for directions. I used the Singing Lift and after the concert it was extremely busy and it took quite a time to get to the ground floor exit."
3353,No disabled parking near the restaurant. 
3354,Very easy.
3355,Tweedbank Station is close by (an easy and flat walk). I am sure that there is good disabled parking but we didn't use it.
3356,The toilets are located towards the rear of the restaurant with and uneven entry to the toilet. The toilet is unisex and not for the sole use of disabled people. There is manoeuvring space enough for a wheelchair and there are transfer rails and support bars present. Also the toilet has an emergency alarm. The tap uses lever and it mixes both hot and cold water and an automatic hand dryer is available.
3357,Really enjoyed our visit - much more interesting than many other stately homes I've visited - not so much history as living history & great to see estate continuing to be important to the local community. Holkham Hall is undergoing redevelopment when we visited so please check for latest information. Accessibility generally great - but please  see specific note re stairs in the main house.
3358,"There is parking at Westfield, and it is possible to arrive step-free on the Jubilee or DLR lines. Beware of the maze leading you out of Stratford Station. If you've come by Jubilee Line, you are likely to end up at the two lifts at the foot of the staircase leading to the bridge to Westfield, and these lifts are dreadful. One was out of order when I visited, the other was hugely over-full. I queued for 20 minutes to use it."
3359,"The staff here are fantastic always welcoming and have offered help at every step - from picking out sandwiches to always offering to take orders to your table - grabbing additional napkins and sugars etc. on the way to you.
 Can't praise the staff here enough!"
3360,"The only wheelchair accessible public toilet in the hotel is on the ground level. The toilet is roomy with dropdown bars either side of the toilet, there is room under the sink for a wheelchair user and both the toilet flush and the tap are sensor operated."
3361,"There is no parking around the restaurant as it is in the middle of a very busy part of the city but there are several car parks within wheeling distance. 
As it is in the city there are bus stops a short distance away and a taxi or Uber can drop off or collect outside."
3362,Friendly and helpful
3363,"There are a few blue badge parking bays on the promenade. At this time of year, there wasn’t the problem of them all being taken."
3364,"There was plenty of space to manoeuvre in the toilet, grab rails in suitable places and plenty of space for a carer. The sink was located at a suitable height. The restaurant itself is quite large and spacious, and the toilets are separated therefore be sure to ask for a table nearby the toilets if the distance could cause a problem."
3365,Really good level access through-out. Only the aquarium couldn't be reached in a wheelchair but this was made clear from the outset. Great day for everyone.
3366,"Plenty of seating available. Lift to lower floor, where there  are numerous historic displays. Also to upper level & access to the ramparts. All very easy to navigate with smooth, level floors and plenty of ramps. Small lift also to go up three stairs to the outside deck. "
3367,"Staff get full marks. On more than one occasion we were asked if we needed any assistance as we moved around the floors, shops and eateries. All done in a discrete and helpful manner."
3368,"A cosy, retro tea room with classic Scottish bakes and treats. It is a little small, but there is a large accessible loo."
3369,Ramped access to Disability Snowsports Office and flat access onto the train up the mountain and lift at the cafe at the top to access the mountain.
3370,There are two disabled parking spaces which are chained off so they can’t be misused. Just ring on arrival and staff will remove the chain. 
3371,"We can not praise them enough, they were so great. Answered all our questions, looked after us spectacularly"
3372,The quay is easy to access and flat. There's a couple of different ways to get onto the Causeway - if you don't fancy the steps or the grassy bank you need to get through an additional car park where there is a ramp to access it. From there it's a nice level path out into the marshes. On the way back we dropped down to what looks like a big pond which actually features a variety of wildfowl & wildlife.
3373,The staff are excellent. Very friendly and welcoming. 
3374,"There is parking in the immediate area but dependent upon the event, it can be very busy.

The Lothian Buses No.35 service stops immediately outside of the Corn Exchange. Bus stops are on either side of the service road and there are dropped kerbs to facilitate crossing for wheelchair users. Unfortunately, cars felt they had a greater priority so two of the dropped kerbs were obstructed. You may have to travel 100 metres to find the next drop kerb if this happens during your visit."
3375,"We took the guided tour which includes a visit inside one of the Kelpies! Access very easy and the doors in to the Kelpies are very massive/wide with a nice, smooth decked interior.

Obviously you do need to take a bit of care if you venture near to the canal sides."
3376,A. Heavy door to enter but once inside there is plenty of space between tables to easily get around. Was able to park my scooter right next to the table for easy transfer or not stay on scooter.
3377,Front door straight off street - tiny ramp. No bother.
3378,"The accessible toilet was very clean and tidy. It is accessed directly off the square, on the National Gallery side. There are separate men and women toilets and each also has an accessible toilet. The accessible toilet on the women's side is just before the pay turnstile. It can be opened with a radar key or you can ask a member of staff to unlock it for you. The toilet is large with grab rails.

My only concern is the colour contrast for people with a visual impairment. The walls, door, sink, soap dispenser and toilet are all made of the same shade of stainless steel. Also the hand dryer and floor are grey. Bright red foam has been put on the grab rails, but no where else.

By the door was a red light (not illuminated) and below what appeared to look like a reset button. However, I could not see an emergency cord or button for assistance, although it looks like at one time there might have been one given the light and button."
3379,Everyone was friendly and helpful.  The Hostess in the Duchess of York (refurbished carriage that is now used for dinning) was attentive and thoughtful. 
3380,We drove to the venue so I can't advise on public transport. There are disabled parking bays at the rear of the building. 
3381,"The number 2, 14, 30 and 33 Lothian buses all stop nearby at Prestonfield Avenue.
Some cars do park in the cemetery entrance but it is not clear if this is just for residents or if people visiting the cemetery can park there. On street parking on Dalkeith Road is possible as long as it is not between 7:30 - 9:30am and 4:00 - 6:00pm."
3382,"The museum, shop and lunchroom are fully accessible for wheelchairs.  Storage lockers and a garderobe are available free of charge.  There is no ramp to this area, but staff members can assist you."
3383,Excellent staff and very helpful! Just wish they would assist the toilet system a lot better
3384,"Staff were very friendly. I asked a few different staff about disabled access, and all of them were very knowledgeable and friendly."
3385,"We used the buses to get there so don't have any experience of driving or parking in Rome. Buses were easily accessible for my partner, and staff were all very helpful."
3386,Dedicated blue badge bays near the front door. A little more tricky by public transport although there is a bus stop around 100m away but not frequent buses.
3387,Extremely helpful and friendly. Always willing to answer any questions you may have.
3388,"Getting up on to the High Street as a wheelchair user does come with some challenges but with a little planning we managed it. If you have a car then you can drive and park in the accessible parking bay behind St Giles Cathedral if the road is open. There is another handy accessible parking space at the top of Cockburn Street. Many of the roads close during the festivals so check first. 

We took a bus up on to George IV Bridge because from there it is a downhill run to the fringe shop. We also knew that you could leave the shop and meander downhill to the ""Bridges"" where we could get another bus. The road itself is cobbles but the paving on either side is slabs and a fairly smooth run to wheel along. It does get very busy with people during the festival."
3389,"I drove into the first large car park on the left hand side, with disabled access close to the entrance of the gardens. There was a short walk from the car park down a gentle slop, there are are 3 steps if you prefer to walk down steps.  There is a drop off/collection point available at Crag Lane adjacent to the shop building."
3390,"The accessible loo was fine, a nice large room, clean and well laid out, with a red cord all the way to the floor. Shame the bin was pedal operated, though! Also the loo is on the ground floor level while the concert hall is on the first floor."
3391,"Port Sunlight village dates back to the 19th Century and was build by then William Leaver for his workers at the Sunlight soap factor the Village is a mixture of different styles of houses that a fact still lived in to today. 
You are able to drive round the village and admire the wonderful architecture of the period however you have to respect the fact that these are in fact still peoples homes.
There is also a museum that shows a film and takes you through the story the village there is a charge to go round the Museum and the cottage next to it that gives you an example of the homes the workers lived in 
        "
3392,"There was a very wide door, you go through the entryway where toilets are and there are chairs and benches, through into the bar area with you lots of seats, into the restaurant at the back. It was easy to get past the other tables. The whole area is carpet so a bit harder to self-propell. The tables are a good height. There are no steps. We had to go pay at the bar though which was very high and staff didn’t offer to help so I sent a friend up to pay for mine."
3393,Accessible access without stairs available at the bottom of the venue. A lot of the performance was done with BSL and had captioning on the screen. Absolutely amazing show by ZooCo called Sirens which covered a lot of hard hitting societal issues in a fun and thought-provoking manner. Would 100% see again!
3394,Parking was good with wide enough bays to accommodate our WAV (wheelchair accessible vehicle) and room to wheel alongside each side of the car. It was as easy roll from the parking to the visitor centre's entrance being only around 50 meters away. Public transport might be more of a challenge as the main road where the buses run was some distance away. Although we did notice that there were some tour buses operating that may pull into the visitor centre complex.
3395,I did not use the accessible loo so cannot comment on it. 
3396,"Disabled access is very good at the Hydro. Level-entry access into the venue with lifts within to take you to the different levels. Anytime I've never the lifts have always been quiet - never had to queue. Staff friendly and helpful. Viewing platform the accessible seating is also very good. I sometimes prefer the view from the bottom level when I've been seated in sections 052. 053 etc. Level 2 has great wheelchair access as well with lots of space to maneuver your wheelchair around. The view of the stage has alway been pretty good on the whole, apart from the very odd time when people in front have stood up blocking my view. Once I've notified staff they've always asked the people to sit down. 

There is an infrared loop system available at The Hydro in various blocks on Level 2, but it is important to email (info@sec.co.uk) the venue for more information as each event can vary in terms of how it can be operated. To borrow an infrared receiver make sure you head for the Information Desk on the ground floor."
3397,5 stars isn’t enough
3398,"Easy access, flat entrance and exit, automated doors, space for manoeuvring, bold signs, braille was uncommon."
3399,Friendly and helpful
3400,Very close to Waverly station.
3401,We parked on St Vincent Street which was only a 2 min walk to the cafe. We were able to park for free with our blue badge.
3402,"Large, easy to access and clean! Great!"
3403,"I support a young adult on respite trips every 3 weeks, we have been to Hope Cross Cottage 3 times so far and will now be one of our regular places to stay when we go away as it is a perfect place for us to stay. It has everything we need, wide doors, large spacious wet room with hand rails and shower chair, spacious living room and bedroom to manoeuvre wheelchair, comfy beds, wifi and it is cosy!! Everything is always clean when we arrive, parking is right outside and the owners are always very welcoming. The seating area outside is perfect to relax and enjoy the view, which is again all accessible. Thank you!! :) "
3404,"Each store has their own staff of course, so the usual mix of attention, as per high street shops. However, each store was very attentive to my needs and helped wherever they could - can't expect better than that can you?"
3405,A friend drove to theatre and dropped my mum off outside the theatre door
3406,Spacious toilet doubling as baby change. Red cord doesn't reach the ground. The toilet may be locked and you may have to ask for staff to open it for you.
3407,"Toilet had a sliding door which was of a medium weight. There were 3 bins in this toilet and a baby changing table.

Grab rails around toilet and sink. Enough floor space to turn but a large bin in transfer space (which was to the left --->). Lowered mirror and bag hook. Would struggle to fit two people and a wheelchair in. "
3408,All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Nothing appeared to be too much trouble. Hats off to all of them!
3409,The Wardrobe is very close to Leeds Bus Station and about a 20 minute walk from Leeds City train station. Taxis can drop off outside but we do not know about parking. 
3410,"All shops, cafes, reastaurants, bars etc had good wheelchair access. The Roman theatre was a climb but parts of it had been exposed at street level and one could access the stage of the Roman amphitheater by wheelchair. "
3411,Easy to get in and around the shop and restaurant
3412,"Staff were polite, friendly and happy to assist with explaining how the mobility scooter worked, and talking through the mobility scooter and wheelchair route maps. The staff were keen to answer any questions or queries, providing information on the whereabouts and access to the disabled toilets."
3413,"I did not see any changing places toilets. In one hall all the disabled toilets are inside the gendered toilets, inaccessible for wheelchairs and scooters, people won’t move out of the way if there is a queue, and I found mops and cleaning equipment stored in one. In the other hall where there is separate accessible toilets there are no radar keys so used by all. There are more upstairs, but there's only one lift so you often have to queue for ages to use the lift that malfunctions. Very poor for a venue of this size. "
3414,A steepish push up Little King Street and a fairly heavy swing door are the only obstacles. On our way in a kind customer held ithe door open for us. Exiting was easy with the accompanist opening the door.
3415,"There are toilets as you come through the main gates, next to Court Yard Cafe, room for a Carer. All toilet are in the one area and well signed.
There are more Toilets downstairs in the house next to The Restaurant, Disabled is on left hand side, there are 2 disabled toilets here and are well signed and room for a carer
There are No toilets whilst going around the House, we had to come out and back down the stair lift. Staff were understanding  and helped with a short cut out."
3416,The hotel room was very acessable I  could drive round independent
3417,The staff are very helpful.
3418,"Plenty of parking on hard,compact stone"
3419,There are a good number of disabled parking spaces.
3420,"This is a large pub all on one level apart from a couple of tables , so it is easy to get around with an electric chair.toilets all on same level as well.recently decorated now has a few tables outside as well."
3421,i went to Brent Cross to meet my peer mentor at Wagammas we were not able to go as both lifts to food court were being refurbished and 3rd lift was out of order.  We ended  up going to a restaurant in Fenwick which was ok.  But we were on ground floor and had to go to 3rd floor for accessible toilets which were through the men's toilets.  I had to ask for help a) find toilets b). Open door.
3422,"This is not my first visit and I will be going again. It changes with the seasons! (what a surprise!)
Firstly if you cannot manage the steep slope down from the car park to entrance - you can phone and they will collect you form the disabled parking! I book an electric wheelchair ahead  ( I find it essential as there is a lot of steep paths.
It has been designed with enabling the disabled everywhere (except the tree top wire narrow footbridge) access is brilliant, good toilet facilities and priority requested for disabled in lifts. wheelchair can park at end of long food hall tables or eat individually outside
Your 'personal assistant' goes in free and multiple entries are available for following 12 months - they just ask for a donation for the very comfortable electric wheelchair
I would give higher than 5 stars if I could!! All the staff were more than helpful"
3423,There was 2 disabled toilets but people were using these toilets when they could of maybe used the normal toilet. Priority should be for people with disabilities .
3424,"Unfortunately there is no step-free access to this cinema. Once inside there is good signage, helpful staff and nice bright lighting. But without step-free access I can't give this a high review. Their website does not have clear access information either, so I am unsure if they have audio description for example. One thing I did think was good is that there are multiple ways to book tickets - so if you don't like using the telephone you can book online, or if you don't like using computers they have a 24-hour booking line over the phone."
3425,"I wouldn’t say the staff were really friendly when I visited. We stood near the entrance until we decided what we wanted but, when we did get to the till no staff members acknowledged us for a couple of minutes when we were the only customers at the till. Finally when they started to serve us they only spoke to my helper. When my helper told the staff member that it was me that was ordering, she still spoke to my helper. I think at first it was because of the height of the counter but, I feel the second time was more rudeness. Finally I got to order my drink myself."
3426,A number of disabled bays immediately outside entrance of the hotel.
3427,"Disabled parking is excellent, with each cottage having it's own allocated parking space.  The village is on a main bus route, with direct bus links to St Andrews and Edinburgh as well as local bus services.  2 train stations within approximately 10 miles, Markinch and Kirkcaldy."
3428,"The theatre was easy to enter using a long shallow ramp to the stage. Seats could be removed to increase space for wheelchairs. Had a great uninterupted view of the stage from the front row. Plenty of food and drink venues outside with staff helpful if you couldn't reach ordering counters. Ground covered in astro turf so not affected by numbers or poor weather.
After a member of staff lead me to my seat they were willing to take my scooter out to a powersocket so it could be charged up during the performance. It was then returned as soon as the show ended. Amazing customer service."
3429,Staff escort you to one of the disabled changing rooms - each has a shower (with shower seat) and bench and plenty of room. Lockers solely for the use of disabled visitors are located right outside the loo and the First Aid team will look after the key for you so you don't have to take it into the loo. If you need more than one locker - that's fine.
3430,staff are always very helpful and will help carry heavy shopping to tills and then to vehicle if required. They will also help to carry over your food in restaurant is required. At the till the staff go out of their way to you!
3431,"The main entrances both had lots of steps. Luckily my companion was able to go in and located a level entrance further up. It wasn't labelled or signposted at all.  Sadly it also had heavy doors - would be v difficult for someone on their own.
Once inside though there are multiple steps up to the bar and no way of summoning staff! So don't go in here unless you've an able bodied companion!"
3432,"Think 1950s icecream parlour.... a relaxed and quirky vibe with many, many flavours of the most delicious ice cream that I've tasted. There is also savoury food (I had a crepe with avocado and tomato), hot dogs, chilli etc, along with decent coffee or alcohol if you prefer. Oh yes, and it is wheelchair accessible with a decent loo and no fuss made. The waiter discretely removed a chair for me and we could concentrate on the important business of choosing he food."
3433,The nearest station is 5-10 minute walk so not suitable if you have mobility difficulties.
3434,"There was an accessible toilet, and standard toilets.

I did not use these so am unable to comment further."
3435,"Most staff first class, but activity and leisure staff were lacklustre"
3436,Decent accessible toilet but it could had been a bit cleaner.
3437,"An overall very competent handling of the needs of physically disabled wheelchair users.  More ramps needed however, as understanding of 'level access' a little shaky and was made to mount a doorway which was far to high for my wheelchair.  I know from experience this has the potential to break my chair, and does not help pain levels."
3438,Excellent in restaurant and disabled toilets. Got up few steps to where jazz played using ramp and strong waiters. Single yellow line outside and parking areas. No probs for blue badge holders.
3439,Stall holders are very friendly and helpful in showing you their produce and helping you make a purchase.
3440,There was a step into the main door but a ramp was provided.
3441,This pub has a RADAR key toilet which is a reasonable size.
3442,They are guaranteed parking for disabled people in front of the shop and the bus stop and the bus train is' three minutes by walking
3443,They are at lift entrance - new and build to British Standards
3444,There are so many people with disabilities (and so many families and friends who accompany them) that no one is treated differently.
3445,Friendly staff
3446,"Unfortunately as I went in March, the Lighthouse was closed. However, we did see some beautiful puffins but that is all we seen -_-"
3447,There were grabrails on the left as you sat on the loo plus a dropdown rail on the right - I would have liked an additional vertical one. The shower is wheelchair accessible and had grabrails to the left of the drop-down seat and a drop-down rail to the right -- see photos.
3448,"Wide aisles, plenty of room. Was quiet and calming."
3449,After driving through the tunnel you emerge on the Hoe. Separated from other land areas it offers views of the sea and white cliffs plus a landscape to view nature. Paths are up and down on a firm but cambered surface. We did a 2 K circular route. There is a good toilet and cafe with picnic benches. People can fish from the sea wall.  Solid surface car park. 
3450,"There are not really very many of these considering the size of the town centre. 
These are the ones I know of: There is one in M&S (not locked), there is one in the Health Centre on Ashburner street (not locked), two in the Market place shopping centre one of which has a RADAR lock. 
There is a changing places facility at Bolton One which is a bit of a trek from the shops if you're desperate."
3451,"I drove and, sorry, have no idea about public transport. Parking is tricky as only one dis bay exists on the same level as reception."
3452,"Let's start with the journey towards the priory. We crossed the bridge over the RIver Wharfe and did the Welly Walk. This was fine - flat, wide and good surface. Then we crossed a ford and began climbing steeply. There's a gate that leads towards the priory. Once through the gate, there is a sheer drop on your right and the path is quite narrow and extremely steep in places. We started but I really didn't feel safe so we turned back. The alternative route to the priory is through the car park and over a field but then there is a flight of steps, which makes it impossible for me.

So Strid Woods... We passed Cavendish Pavillion and continued through large metal gates (open). The path was great! Really wide and mostly compacted gravel. For an off-road chair, it was perfect! However, after the first stretch, the path splits and we opted to take the upper path. I'm really scared of nettles and have a nasty reaction to them and the lower route, according to hubby, was far too overgrown. He said I wouldn't have coped with it. 

On the way there, I managed all the hills by myself but they were quite steep in places and prolonged. By the time we reached the Strid (only a mile), I was quite tired! The Strid was great though, with a wheelchair accessible viewing platform. 

On the way back, I needed some help with the uphill stretches but it was well worth the effort and we had a very enjoyable day out."
3453,"Not really suitable for standard wheelchairs, my client has a 4x4 chair that managed the slope that has slights steps on it but it wouldn’t work in a normal chair. Some areas aren’t accessible as he would need to turn round to come back the wrong way in the one way system as there were stairs at the far end. "
3454,"All on the flat, wide corridors. Double door at entrance, but one side was wide enough to get wheelchair through
General access to the establishment is difficult to find, down a narrow unlit lane"
3455,"A good disabled toilet, however it is a bit of a twisty walk from the restaurant, with some uneven flooring."
3456,Very proactive and helpful. 
3457,Ramp access to lodge. Door could be awkward to manage without assistance as its swings back. 
3458,There was great access. The entrance nearest to the car park was flat. It had double doors which easily opened. It is flat throughout It is a bit tight to get through in places but you can manage if you are careful. The other entrances appeared to have a very small step in. With a little bit of help you'd get a wheelchair over them fairly easily.
3459,Excellent in every way - quick to respond to the needs of a wheelchair user and all fluent speakers of English.
3460,"A ramp or steps take you to the front door. The door is heavy but assistance is available. Once inside there's plenty of space to manoeuvre, good lighting, and helpful staff."
3461,"So helpful! Everyone from the outside security, merch vendors and stewards inside were so cheerful and happy to help without being condescending."
3462,Staff were friendly and helpful. There is a low level reception desk with staff behind. Numerous Life guards are present at pool times all time for safety reasons.
3463,"The market was easy to access and had multiple entry ways. All areas of the market were accessible to our wheelchair users, however some of the routes between stalls were narrow. Overall there were very wide spaces in between the stalls. "
3464,"Every venue is ramped, although occasionally the doorway ridge can be a pain but when this happens it is clearly marked with hazard tape and staff will help you if needed.  A sturdy metal ramp was specifically made for the stone steps in the middle of one of the parks and when the book tent was near to that the staff were quick to react when it was pointed out that people were blocking the ramp by queueing up that instead of the steps!  Up went the notices!  "
3465,Wheelchair accessible but the staff are so rude.
3466,"You could get around the lower floor, there was a ramp and a video session of the upper floor that was inaccessible. The gardens were partially accessible to the disabled, but sufficient enough."
3467,"Spacious, but full changing facilities are not available."
3468,"We parked in the Mercat centre shopping car park. 
Not sure about public transport."
3469,"Drove to the venue, pre booked free disabled parking. The parking was right outside the stadium entrance and accessible by ramp."
3470,"Car park with too few disabled bays, area in poor condition, those on walking aids will have to be careful. At least it was not to far from a few old grade 11 buildings, but they need to be paid a lot more attention to before they are lost for good."
3471,"Toilets were spacious and clean, and there were plenty to be found."
3472,"Car park is up a hill but there are designated disabled pays. You can park on the road if have a disabled parking badge (double yellows) but due to illegal parking this isn't always possible.

There is a bus stop outside the shop (Ilkeston Flyer towards Ilkeston and Spondon flyer). The stop towards Derby is on other side of road."
3473,"The museum is best reached by car or taxi. The company Accessible Travel Netherlands can arrange a taxi for you if needed.  If going by public transportation, Oudewater has no train station, but is reachable by bus from the larger surrounding cities.  Be sure to call ahead to ensure all buses you will be traveling on are accessible."
3474,"The bathroom was a good size, with a sliding door; there was plenty of space in it for my wife to manoeuvre her wheelchair.   access to it was easy for my wife due to the large amount of floor space just outside it. 
Strong shower seat and plenty of grab bars.
As is common with most other Premier Inn rooms we have stayed in, the thermostatic shower was easy to control and the water pressure was very good; it remained at a constant temperature whilst showering. 

We didn't use the toilet in the reception / restaurant area.
"
3475,"I interacted with six members of staff, three spoke direct to me and were very nice in their demeanor. The other three were not very friendly, one saying he was the operations manager was quite hostile, one responded to my carer when I was talking to him, and another totally ignored me. "
3476,Friendly and helpful staff
3477,"A great start to our Northumberland adventure - access for all, friendly staff and delicious food. I would definitely return when  revisiting Northumberland"
3478,"Had no unexpected issues - just had to take care on the grass. Not a huge site and easy to et around. We saw several wheelchair users and imagine they would have issues with the jeep and the train, but overall very good. "
3479,"Big accessible car park, but no disabled spaces that we could see."
3480,See above. Only problem is the bath.
3481,The public transport in the area is good with regular tour buses running though the Grassmarket as well as local buses. Parking on street (for Blue Badge Holders) is available nearby but it can be very busy at times.
3482,"During our 10 day holiday, my wife often pushed me along the  2 mile walkway that run fron the rear of the hotel we were staying in to the harbour area and beyond.

Seemingly the beach was 'man made' which may accounted for the hardness of is.  We often seen wheelchair and buggies using it, either on wooden walkways or the impacted sand.

I often stopped to which volleyball matched and seeing Camels give rides was also a good distraction.

We also enjoyed watching the Chipmunks scurrying about the rocks"
3483,"The building was wheelchair accessible, and again, plenty of room to manoeuvre. The changing benches were height adjustable and there was also a pool hoist. "
3484,"For me arrival was straightforward as a taxi can take you to the main entrance. Beware the odd pavements as it’s up two steps in places and is not all that obvious; certainly not to me as a visually impaired person.

I understand there are buses running along nearby Lothian Road (approximately 100 metres) that go to all parts of the city.

If coming by car there are car parks nearby and the hotel has discount arrangements. 

The railway stations at Haymarket and Waverley are only a ten-minute taxi journey."
3485,Very helpful and always asking if they could help with anything.
3486,We parked a little while away behind Buchanan street. There are some blue badge spaces dotted around the city centre but you have to be lucky to catch one. There is also multi-storey parking available nearby
3487,This is our 2nd stay at Summerfield Holiday Cottages in Scoreby Cottage.  There are 4 properties and the owners Jayne and Richard and live on site.  Nothing is too much trouble and my wife who is chair bound and I really love the location
3488,Great access to this cinema. All screens have wheelchair spaces at the front and 3 screens also have wheelchair spaces at the back. These are accessed  by a lift - show a member of staff your tickets and they'll take you up in the lift. 
3489,friendly
3490,"Both brothers are very friendly, welcoming and are as chirpy as the budgies, what is noticeable the birds and small animals are not there for long which shows a well informed and trusted business that finds homes for their stock."
3491,Very efficient and accessible service - best way to visit Bath City Centre
3492,Large car-park with numerous disabled parking bays.
3493,"Tourist mini train which travels along La Croisette, Cannes' sea front, and through Le Suquet, Cannes' hilly old town area. The train makes a 10 minute stop in the square outside Notre Dame to visit the church and see the views from the top of the hill."
3494,I only was going to the cinema and was able to go there without a problem and there was a lift to easily get you from the car park to the building rather than having to do the long walk round by the Nethergate  to get to the Normal entrance. Not sure whether when there is not COVID restrictions you can use the back entrance apart from for disabled access.
3495,"Rothes Football Club is a senior football club who play in the Highland Football League. They play at Mackessack Park in Rothes, a small town near Elgin in Moray. They play in tangerine shirts, colours they inherited from Dundee United after purchasing the floodlights from Tannadice Park. Rothes have won the Highland League once Mackessack Park is named after one Douglas Mackessack, a local laird and whisky magnate and an early benefactor of the club. 


It was a nice day so we decided to visit Mackessack Park, we parked above the ground but to my surprise, Rothes football club must be the only Highland League Club in existence to have a private car park. There was a slope down to the car park but this is manageable. I got in for free which is class/ wheelchair users get in for noting. We were not told where wheelchair users should sit which is disappointing as there is usually a member of staff who tells wheelchair users where to sit. We finally decided to sit in the main stand. It was a good view and highly recommended."
3496,"Cafe Rouge is a very easily accessible restaurant, with space to sit inside or outside. It serves French food and is good quality for a reasonable price. The immediate surrounding area includes other bars/restaurants, the Peace Gardens and the Winter Gardens. These spaces are all open, attractive and accessible."
3497,Staff let you browse at your leisure. There is a lot to see.
3498,"There is level access to the restaurant but the entrance door is not automatic. There is an upstairs dining area with further tables but it is only wheelchair accessible if you use the service lift. The ground floor is modern, spacious and has a variety of seating options. The chairs a the bar are very high (see photo)."
3499,There is a toilet just outside the store but still in the covered shopping centre.you need a radar key to get in but if you do t have yours they lend you one at customer services
3500,Chania is a town in western Crete.  The town is the former capital city of Crete (from 1847 until 1972). It's most famous attraction is its Old Venetian Harbour (see separate review). It has a mainly pedestrian old town as well as a modern city centre.
3501,"Travelled from out of London by car, so disabled parking was essential. Five blue badge spaces in the staff carpark, should be booked at least 24hr ahead. Set SatNav to John Islip Street rather than to the main entrance. Staff car park is not obvious, so keep a good eye out.
"
3502,There is a ramped access at the front of the restaurant and a big conservatory which is a good place to sit if you want more space.
3503,"We used the mobility vehicle to reach the hilltop garden and it was well worth it. There are many paths to get around, some concrete, others hard surfaces and one which we did not venture down was made of wood chippings. There are quite a few long slopes and some are a bit steep but it is possible to see most of the grounds if you have someone to help with a wheelchair. Wheelchair users are able to bring an attendant in for free.  Everywhere is well signposted and there are maps available."
3504,We travelled by train which was very busy but takes you straight into centre. Have used park and ride before but return queues looked very long. A few on street disabled spaces in centre.  Bath has Shopmobility (not used).
3505,"The disabled toilet is a bit strange - you go through a lobby to it. I waited outside for quite a while before realising the door led to the lobby and not the main toilet! Bar staff have a radar key for it. Inside it's a little bit small, but nicely done and very clean."
3506,"Right opposite Trinity College, lots of buses stopping nearby and a short-ish walk from Luas trams."
3507,"Access is really good , without any complicated procedures , wide pavements , roads."
3508,Staff are very helpful to all inmates and visitors. I have put on five pounds so no need to mention about the food.
3509,"This is a huge Wetherspoons and as seems to be the norm now at this chain, Access was good and seemed to well thought out. It’s a busy place (or was very much so the day we visited) but there was enough space to navigate to the large accessible loo. We’d go back. It’s clearly a popular spot for locals and visitors. It’s a handy stop for lunch or a drink after a visit to the castle or hitting the shops. "
3510,Very helpful! Especially when my pal was standing so close to a painting that he set an alarm off! There was a staff member close at hand at all times and willing to answer questions.
3511,Automatic door entry and wide aisles.  When busy it can be a little more difficult to manoeuvre if people don't pull their chairs right in. Couldn't see signs for the toilets.
3512,"Superb - although a bit out of the way', the venue is on a major bus route and there is a good, large car park with dedicated disabled spaces (but you my have to drive around to find a space)."
3513,"There are automatic entrance doors leading into reception, however, there are heavy manual doors leading out of the reception area towards the lift.  Staff always helped me with these doors; the lift is a bit tight for a powerchair and another passenger but it's just manageable for me.  The room itself was great for a non-disabled family room."
3514,"There were no steps at the entrance , just a small threshold which was easily negotiated. The path to the main entrance was brick and nice and level (just a very gentle slope at the car park end of it but nothing too severe). Apparently to get from the main eating area inside directly to the outside eating area and loos, there's a small step. However there's an alternative route round the side, which is level (albeit not so great for visiting the loo if it's raining!). Inside, the circulation space was a bit limited as the space was full of table and chairs. Stowing my wheelchair was a bit tricky, though the staff when asked said they had somewhere else they could take it."
3515,Every member of staff is fantastic and makes you very welcome from the moment you arrive to you leave.  We had lots of fun during our visit to this hotel.
3516,"The toilet is huge! Plenty of space to turn and for a carer. However, there is only one toilet for the whole cafe. There isn’t a grab rail at the side of the toilet and there is no red cord or alarm. The floor is always wet because the sink is tiny. About 2 months ago I spoke to the staff about the lack of red cord or replacement grab rails (as there is evidence that there used to be some), they were a bit dismissive but said they ‘d pass it on. I was disappointed on my recent visit that this hadn’t been changed. "
3517,Plenty of on street disabled spots near by.
3518,"There are two disabled parking bays, however there is also plenty of parking close to the entrance. The hotel is not near either a railway station or bus route."
3519,"Lots of buses from Leith walk and also from the bridges. 

Disabled parking in Omni centre car park (warning - it is expensive!)"
3520,The staff member didn't seem to know what she was talking about and didn't seem to have any information when asked.
3521,"Staff were fantastic, very friendly and attentive throughout."
3522,"This place was very unexpected. It used to be a working farm so lots of wide flat paths from when tractors etc. would have been using the space.
The restaurant was step free, although there was a lip at the entrance, I’ve tried to include a picture to demonstrate this. The farm shop was well stocked without being hard to manoeuvre. Lots of other activities available here, including grass sledging, roller skating, a sand pit and beer and gin tours, but I’m not sure how accessible these activities are."
3523,"All staff were friendly and helpful. Advice and directions were given when asked but otherwise, they left us in peace. "
3524,The tourist guides could not offer any information about diabled access.  We found the moving stairs by chance
3525,Unfortunately steep steps to the toilet make this cafe fairly inaccessible. 
3526,the restaurant itself is very disabled friendly
3527,Not sure of toiletting situation but there is a changing place in Blackpool tower which is a minutes walk away.
3528,"Great library, helpful staff, spacious and easy to navigate."
3529,Staff are most helpful and friendly
3530,"What a lovely visit, the staff are so nice and friendly, very willing to give you all the support you need, and Margo our waitress is so kind and willing, and gave her best for us."
3531,Level entrance from the street
3532,"The one thing I give them full marks for, toilets were fab, including a Changing Places next to the Mary Rose, which even had a toilet sling on the hoist. "
3533,"Was OK not the best disabled toilet, it was not very clean but very accessible. It was easy to access on the tramper. "
3534,"The perimeter of the power station land forms part of the coastal walkway. It's a bit futuristic and weird but there is lots of wildlife, open space and amazing coastal views.  There's a huge concrete walkway on two levels that is very strange just because of what it is, a couple of fenced pier areas, a huge runway like area with wildlife planting and a huge kind of abandoned travel car park that's reverting back to nature and all in the shadow of the huge power station. Very silent and thought provoking though. Quite a few dog walkers and fishermen. There is a visitor centre which we didn't use but we spoke to a chap in a wheelchair and he said the facilities were very good for disabled visitors. Well worth a visit!"
3535,"Disabled toilet seemed spacious and tidy with enough room for the carer. There are 3 doors leading to the toilet (narrowest one being 80 cm/ 32"" wide)"
3536,"Automatic doors and level access into the main reception and event space. Reception is spacious with smooth floors. If you are going into the hotdesk area (which leads to the offices in the rest of the building), a pass is required. One star dropped for the awkward position of the the door to the card entry system - particularly as the door is not automatic. Reception staff and people in the building are very friendly and willing to help however, so this isn't usually an issue.

Inside the hotdesk area is a coffee shop and various tables of different styles and heights. There is also table-tennis and the interesting Barclays Eagle Lab to explore. The area, like most of the building, is spacious and easy to move around. If you are venturing further into CodeBase, the hallways are nice and wide, but the doors are a little clunky and you'll need passes for most of them. "
3537,Good but sa D this what when she didn’t know for sure. Could see her 
3538,Pleasant friendly and helpful. 
3539,"Stuck down at the foot of a hill by the Loch side you'd think access was going to be a problem but Urquhart Castle has thought carefully about this. I found it easy to get around as a visually impaired person and my pal who is a powerchair user also had a great time. 

On arrival we received a warm welcome and the stewards explained how to get down to the Visitor Centre using the lift. Once there it was barely a few seconds before another steward came over to greet us, tell us about the accessible route to the film presentation, the accessible loos and the way down to the Castle. 

We enjoyed the film and the amazing views that you see when the curtains draw back from the film and you see the Castle through the panoramic windows. Getting around the gift shop and cafe was easy with plenty of space, good lighting and level access. 

Going outside we sat on the terrace for a while simply admiring the amazing views across Loch Ness and down to the Castle. Going down to the Castle was a long walk along a tarmac pathway. We did notice that you could borrow mobility scooters if you needed to. 

Once down the hill we went across the bridge into the Castle. Once again a steward appeared and explained the wheelchair accessible parts of the Castle and where to get the best view. He then offered my pal a picture book that showed the different parts of the Castle along with explanations and fabulous drawings. I went off exploring the towers and buildings and had a great time."
3540,"The station has an accessible toilet on the South bound platform. The door is automated, the fittings modern and clean. Plenty of space to move around."
3541,"The whole visit was a huge pleasure, we were invited to use the  dedicated parking facility for our campervan right by the entrance. The museum was created and is run by volunteers all of which made us welcome. The site contains many examples of steam pumps and water handling machinery and is of interesst to all age groups with interactive machines for kids of all ages.
The greatest joy to me though was the effort that had been made to accomodate wheelchair users. There is a ""Handy guide  for wheel chair users"" and access to all parts of the site is easily attainable. Great day. Well done the Waterworks Museum."
3542,"I gave it 1.5 points for being large enough to theoretically get a wheelchair into. Theoretically, because I couldn't actually get my wheelchair into the loo because of the stack of large containers making the narrow passage totally impassable for wheelchairs. 
Also no support handles, frame, or emergency pull cord. "
3543,13 spaces right next to the doors
3544,Seat outside for rest or carer to wait. Didn't notice if there were rails but seemed not too small. 
3545,There is clearly visible ramped access to the Burlington House building and plenty of staff to ask how to get to the exhibits or toilets. There is the large (but very busy) Sackler lift to access the different floors of the gallery. You can access the Keeper House via the Sir Hugn Casson cafe on the right as you enter.
3546,"As described in the title this is a small cosy cafe on Queen Margaret Drive in Glasgows West end. They serve delicious coffee with good options for both breakfast and lunch! Staff are very attentive and provide good chat!
"
3547,"There is level access throughout. However if on foot you need to be aware of a hefty metal threshold bar which my wheeled walker really struggled with.  There are a couple of bumps under the flooring in the hallway and dining room which need care taking with. Other than that the whole place is level and easy to negotiate.  Whilst I wasn't in my wheelchair inside the cottage,it looked like there was ample room to manoeuvre onside. Doorways looked quite wide though I didn't check if they were wide enough (though I noted comments from chair users in the visitors book so clearly wheelchairs had been used there). My other concern, which is reflected in the rating, is the kitchen layout. When adding an extension, a run of work surface has been removed meaning the sink is some distance from the stove with no work top. So hot pans have to be carried across the room to be drained, kettle carried across to the tap to fill it, clean crockery ferried across to the cupboard - all without an work top to put things on or slide things across. As a disabled person it was hard for me to help in the kitchen at all. Also tricky for our elderly relatives."
3548,the owners understand disablement and are very helpful.
3549,"The staff were amazing, helpful and very friendly though out my stay. Everytime I passed receiption I was welcomed and asked how I was. They answered my questions and offered suggestions.

A special thank you has to go to Sean Naughton, Rival's concierge, who was incredible. In just speaking to him for 5 minutes I had answers to things I had spent 100 hours trying to find out about access on the internet. Sean listened about what my access needs were and then provided brilliant information. I was wanting to visit Fjaderholmarna, one of the islands off Stockholm and I was unsure if it was accessible. He gave me a map of the island and marked off an accessible route, advised what there was to do and provided information about the boat service to/from the island. Talking to Sean gave me the confidence to visit, I will be doing a seperate review for Fjaderholmarna. We also had a detailed discussion about Gamla Stan, the old town, as some of it is very hilly, and again he drew me a map and advised an accessible route, again giving me the confidence to visit. We also talked about public transport and where I could walk in the evening along the waterfront, which would be an easy journey from the hotel. Sean made a wonderful holiday extra special. When I returned to the hotel he asked me how I got on and he talk me he had left some accessible public transport information in my room, along with a letter, which I have attached as a photograph, saying he had spoken to his manager and they had decided to update the hotel's website to include more general accessible information about the area. I can not thank Sean enough for taking this issue up and for his support to me during my stay. I really appriciate it."
3550,"This is a good budget hotel. It was clean and the staff were friendly. The accessible room was slightly small, but the wet floor shower was a good size and had rails and a seat. The buffet breakfast had a wide selection of hot and continental foods, including vegetarian options. The hotel is close to the centre and about 10min walk to union square. There is a multi storey car park next door. The only down side is that the hotel is on a fairly steep hill  with a cobbled road "
3551,"Access for whole venue was good. But super impressed with the accessible ground floor toilet. It was very large in size, has a height adjustable changing table, toilet with grab rails, height adjustable sink, track hoist that covers the area of toilet and changing table and a privacy screen too. It is the best accessible toilet and changing area I have ever seen!"
3552,"Adapted disabled rooms at the far end of a long corridor with a number of fire doors. Receptionist accepted by complaint, but said it was a requirement of the fire authorities, because the disabled rooms would be next to the emergency exit."
3553,"Plenty of disabled street parking, but not right outside."
3554,Step free access to this small but interesting zoo. Lots of the paths are just compacted earth so can be a bit muddy but well worth a visit.
3555,"Twickenham Stadium, the home of English Rugby Union, is a major sports stadium in south-west London. The stadium is very welcoming of wheelchair users, with good access, attitudes and policies. I've made several visits there, and enjoyed every one!"
3556,Delicious Indian food and the service was excellent most of the times I visited. But wheelchair access is nearly impossible. I have had to phone ahead to let them know I'm coming so that they can open the back door in advance. This back entrance is accessed via a little lane (Torphichen Place Lane) which is very cobbled and it's an uncomfortable ride.
3557,Staff seemed friendly but they lose several stars for making the shop such a wheelchair-unfriendly place.
3558,Quite a big disabled toilet with grab rails. 
3559,"Large wet room with high toilet, toilet frame and grab rails. Shower chairs and seats available."
3560,Drivers are very nice and helpful
3561,very attentive
3562,"A busy London station with links to the underground, local taxis and buses. Best to check on the accessibility of your chosen method of transport. Buses are accessible as are most taxis."
3563,"The lifeguards are stationed here, so are able to assist with accessibility, or any other needs.  

"
3564,"Ramped entrance and two doors - one with automatic push pad. Once inside you are met with a roaring fire, spacious ground floor area and comfy seats. There was a tactile mini-exhibit and, of course, the gin shop. You can also visit the canteen on the ground floor.

I'd also like to mention the helpful information Isle of Harris Distillery share on their website about disabled access. It's not buried away in some hard to find location - it is conveniently placed on their contact page which I thought was refreshing for a visitor attraction's website! It's certainly a long distance to travel from most places if you're in two minds about whether it's going to be accessible or not, so I was pleased to be able to find this info so easily beforehand.

"
3565,The West Yorkshire Playhouse makes every effort to welcome disabled visitors - however the building design makes this a little difficult
3566,"Entrance flat and level ,spacious lower floor, with lift to the restaurant level.  Slim topped tables so wheelchair fitted under and lots of space to maneouver ."
3567,Very good access from the car park via a ramp to the booking office and the Glasgow bound platform. Wheelchair access to the Edinburgh bound platform means going over the adjacent road bridge and down a ramp to the platform.
3568,Stopped in for dinner at this rural pub before a couple of days in the Brecon Beacons and had an excellent high quality gastropub meal with some local beer. There is a gallery upstairs and some surprising wallabies and exotic birds in the back garden (the animals are mostly up some steps).
3569,Staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. 
3570,very friendly and very helpful
3571," The disabled toilet  is spacious but it does not have an emergency red cord.
 See photo."
3572,Read the review summary to see the different parts of Javea and how accessible they are.
3573,"Unfortunately, to enter the pub there is a small step at each door therefore making it difficult for wheelchair users. My Grandad was able to enter the pub using his walking frame, however I feel if his eyesight was particularly bad on one day these could be a trip hazard for him. However the small beer garden is accessible and a lovely place to spend a sunny afternoon. "
3574,There are Blue Badge spaces to the left hand side of the main door as you go in unsure about public transport in the are but the venue is popular with the holiday coach tour firms that you see on the motorway 
3575,"Parking can be tricky around George Square as blue badge spaces are pretty restricted, particularly in festival time.  
Theres a good amount of public transport options to nearby main roads."
3576,Staff were helpful when we enquired about product details.
3577,"Friendly, Helpful, Thoughtful"
3578,Staff were very helpful although at times some seemed unsure about the stair lift.
3579,"Level access, wide door, help always offered in holding the door."
3580,"We met a member of staff called Suzanne at the dolphin show and she was so helpful to me and my family. She greeted us and asked if I wanted to be lifted from the ground floor up a level in order to view the dolphin show better and I said no but she went away and got 2 security boys so I felt more comfortable in asking if they could lift me up so they lifted me up and the view was perfect. There was none of this writing 300 letters to speak to health & safety to see if you could lift a wheelchair like you get in Scotland, they just done it. Also, the Spanish security guard was impressed with my brothers Spanish shirt ""SPANIREDDD!!"". Also, a member of staff said ""You're so white!"" thanks for reminding me about the snow back home :) "
3581,"There is a slope down to the building, with rails each side.  You have to buzz to be entered into the building.  The buzzer is a bit too high for everybody, particularly in a wheelchair,  The reception is immediately opposite the doors and frequently manned so not often an issue.  Reception and the hall to the cafe is large,  easy to manage in a powered wheelchair.  The toilets are not connected to the cafe. and the large disabled toilet is not sign posted."
3582,"A great accessible cafe and meeting place, with lots of space. Its just at the entrance and before the barriers to get into the Arena/Velodrome/Gym so you can meet there without having to pay to go in. The only downside is the transport. Its no great if you have a car (lots of disabled parking bays) but the nearest public transport stops at the Forge which is a good 10-15 min walk."
3583,Really good food. Step-free!
3584,What a pleasure to be able to report on a perfectly designed and laid-out accessible toilet! Full marks!
3585,There is no disabled parking. There is no car park. It is very difficult to find a parking space in this area. There are bus stops nearby if you can use the bus or you can be dropped off by taxi.
3586,"The main entrance to the museum is on Beaumont Street. There is a short flight of stairs with a handrail or a ramp for step free access. At the entrance there is a revolving door and on either side are push button doors. 

The museum is step free. There are lifts to all floors, but not every lift serves all floors, which is slightly confusing. It's not ideal but staff were very helpful in pointing me in the right direction so it wasn't a problem. The lifts are not particularly large, it was crowded when there were 4 people standing in it. The lifts are busy so I usually had to wait a while for the lift to arrive. There are also stairs but I didn't use them.

I went specifically to see the Pompeii special exhibition, which was on the third floor. The exhibition has been extremely popular and is often sold out, so when I visited it was very busy. I had requested a fold up stool and this was extremely helpful as there was a lot to see and I wanted to take the time to read the information panels. The exhibition was well laid out with mainly vertical glass cases. There were some benches without back support or arms throughout the exhibition. 

When I arrived at the museum I went to their self service café in the lower ground floor for a sandwich. The food was displayed on counter and shelves, both suitable for people at standing height. The café had a lot of free standing tables and chairs. The café area has a number of pillars. It was very busy when I visited.

After the exhibition I went to the roof top restaurant on the 4th floor for afternoon tea. The restaurant is waiter service. There are free standing tables and chairs. There is also a step free outdoor terrace, which I didn't use. 
"
3587,"The purpose of our visit was brunch and we were spoiled for choice. The bar is well stocked with craft beers and spirits. As you enter, you meet a lovely member of staff who takes into account your needs and seats you which saves you having to worry . 
To get to the accessible toilet, travel down in a thoughtful placed internal lift - staff are happy to operate this for you.

"
3588,"The disabled toilet is visible on entry to the main building. It is well equipped with space for a carer.
There is also a disabled toilet outside close to the play area."
3589,"bar is located in a pedestrianised zone, making parking a little tricky."
3590,"Public transport is good with lots of buses, taxis and the nearby underground."
3591,"Masham is set in attractive countryside and the brewery is an example of Yorkshire enterprise.  
Access is via an outside self operated lift.  
Good restaurant, beer available.  Shop and tour available to those without mobility issues."
3592,"Step free access to enter the prison but some areas would be inaccessible for wheelchairs. Only ever one step so might be suitable for others with mobility aids, but no hand rails for single steps. 
Signs are small print but lots of pictures and able to understand without the signs. "
3593,Very friendly and always happy to help.
3594,"it is fully acessable, theres a cafe but its a bit cramped.  the food is ok.  store is good too but the only downside is that the cord in the diabled loo is always tied up. its been menthiond to them before but they keep saying its tied up dues to 'hygene' its sometimes tied so high if someone was to have a fall they couldnt get any help at all & the soap dispenser is always empty. "
3595,"Level access, plenty of wheelchair-suitable tables, lovely staff, great cappuccino - a very good wheelchair-friendly café."
3596,"The female staff member was patronising, demanding proof of disability in order to gain a concessionary ticket (free carer entry) despite my being in an active chair. A lecture on how 'proof is always required at attractions' was given in a patronising manner. 
There was no map, no information about accessibility - best routes, difficult areas etc - offered.
There is 1 basic wheelchair for loan. Solid tyres, no cushion, that requires booking in advance.
 "
3597,"The museum has an accessible toilet and accessible elevators.  There is also a lot of room to move your wheelchair around.  Some areas can get crowded, but it is generally manageable."
3598,"We travelled by car, easy to find, several accessible parking spaces"
3599,"Staff are really helpful, calling the lift for me which I sometimes struggle to do and pointing out the disabled toilet as well as moving the chair at the table for me so there was space for my wheelchair."
3600,Staff were friendly and looked like they were having a great time!
3601,Staff very helpful and will do what they can to assist people
3602,The staff helped quite a bit with my cases etc when I arrived. In the morning they were also on hand to make sure I managed with the buffet style breakfast too. Couldn't ask for anything more.
3603,"There was an accessible toilet which required a radar key. A member of staff wheeled me from where I was sitting to the loo, went to get a key and then waited to return me to my seat. It wasn't the cleanest but good otherwise. if you needed to transfer to the loo, you'd have to move a bin. The red cord was good."
3604,There didn't seem to care that it was so hard
3605,"Several bus routes will drop you off practically outside the restaurant. Highbury and Islington Overground station is nearby, and step-free, but Highbury and Islington tube station is *not* step-free. There is no other step-free station nearby. The nearest step-free tube station is King's Cross, which is well over a mile away."
3606,"As we were staying on a half board basis at the Labranda Playa Club, it was only natural we ate at the restaurant attached to the hotel.  
For those not on half board, breakfast was only  around 6.50 euros and the three course evening meal 12 euros.  If staying at the hotel, residents also got a 10% discount.  Excellent value all round.
Breakfast was  self service but had all that one could require -   Fresh fruit, orange juice, yoghurts meats, cheeses and so on.  There was bacon and sausages available with eggs done to order.    The orange juice and coffees were also very nice.  A meal to set one up for the day.
The evening menu was also very extensive, with a lot of choices for starter main and desert courses.
I admit to being a fussy eater but during my 11 nights in the restaurant, I managed to vary my main course quite easily. I felt my wife, as a vegetarian,   did not have a lot of choices but she enjoyed what she had.  I mention this to a member of staff late on our holiday and was told if we said what was required, they would do their utmost to supply.
On this, we found that staff to be friendly and show interest in their customers.  On the occasions the restaurant was busy, the staff were very efficient in ensuring orders were turned around in a reasonable time.  
It was good to watch them in action and they always had a smile for you and seemed genuinely interested in what you had been doing..  
Sorry, but I am really bad at remembering names but Raul and Joanna  were absolute stars.
We only had a bottle of water and a pint of San Miguel with our meals which only cost 4.50 Euros."
3607,The access to the cinema lifts can be quite difficult to find if people have not parked in the level 3 car park as only certain lifts allow direct access to go in the cinema. However there are signs within the shopping centre to direct people to lifts which allow them to go onto level 3. From this point a separate lift on level 3 can be used to connect to the cinema. The desks to purchase tickets are easy to find and were at a suitable height to allow staff members to communicate effectively with the customers
3608,Not many disabled parking bays but there are a couple. The whole car park is quite flat though so its not really a problem.
3609,The staff within the house were very knowledgeable and friendly and warned me of the slightly more narrow doorways . 
3610,"Friendly cheerful and helpful staff is the main plus point. It's a very busy station with only small lifts to get across to the different platforms so it can be a bit of a wait. The accessible toilets are poor, there's only a small cramped one that's very old and tired.
The taxi rank is straight outside the entrance but if you need a wheelchair taxi there is no drop kerb where the taxi stops. You also block the queue as the taxi gets you on board as other taxis can't get past."
3611,The larger vessels also have a separate accessible loo on board which is really good.
3612,"The entrance/exit is a button-operated automatic door. The lower floor consists of high bar tables with a few regular tables, which can be difficult to find space at during busy times, but have otherwise been fine to use in both my powerchair and my manual wheelchair. The staff are very helpful and will always bring your order to your table should you need them to do so. The fridge is at a good height for wheelchair users. There is a RADAR accessible toilet on the lower floor, which unfortunately I have found to be out of order quite often. "
3613,"wheelchair access via Allington Street, if walking there is lots of stairs and steps to climb but do have hand rails."
3614,See photograph. 
3615,This viewpoint  is about 4 miles North of Tarbet. It is a beautiful spot to park at and has good facilities. In high season it gets very busy.
3616,"There is level access, but there are two sets of doors to get through, which can be difficult to get through if on your own in a wheelchair."
3617,"Like the title says this is a wonderful hotel but it isn't very wheelchair friendly. There is a car park near the hotel but I didn't manage to take my scooter into the hotel as there is a big step at the entrance. However, if you get past the obvious hurdle then the hotel itself is very spacious. There is plenty of room to maneuver your wheelchair. There are no disabled toilets in the restaurant and this could be another problem if you need a disabled toilet. The food is absolutely fantastic, however, and also the staff is very welcoming and attentive. "
3618,A different dining experience offering a range of BBQ ribs etc. Let down by it being at sub basement level reached by seven steps with no other wheelchair access. 
3619,"Parking in Stafford Street, round the corner. Well served by buses and the Tram."
3620,The cafe is nice but is very small with the tables very close together.
3621,Staff are wonderful 
3622,"I was shown around by Rebecca from Dundee Science Centre, she was very friendly and welcoming. She was very helpful in answering any questions we had and any other staff we met were also very friendly."
3623,"This was my first time visiting The Queen's Gallery, and I wish I'd gone sooner! The gallery is a beautiful, wooden space with smooth floors and lots of room to move around and admire the exhibition. Maria Merian's Butterflies was the exhibition I went to see, and I won't forget it!"
3624,"Having experienced zoo visits before hopes weren't high. Arriving, browsing and meeting folk it soon became apparent this was going to be something different."
3625,"Several people not in my group were making their way around the gallery and negotiating the boat with sticks and in wheelchairs. 
Photo of toilet attached."
3626,"Very good. There are large automated double doors on entry. There is a robust platform lift to get to the entrance - and when we went in there was someone who came to operate it immediately for us. The lifts between floors are spacious. We only went to the 'everyday' areas as didn't have time to do the special exhibitions but we loved what we saw... 

Large print guides readily available. Displays at a good height. Information available in different formats. There are Audio Guides available. There are also staff members who are BSL users."
3627,"Large wetroom styled bathroom made it easy for me to maneuverer around in there with my powerchair as well as a shower chair, there was plenty of space for both! 
Spacious cottage and wide doorways making it easy to move around the cottage without worrying about narrow doorways and damaging the place.
Incredible ceiling track hoist the goes from the bedroom to the bathroom, covering the entire bedroom and the toilet and bathroom, something that was key to making my stay away actually feel like a relaxing one!"
3628,"New Build, facilities for less abled vast improvement On previous facility.
Fully wheelchair accessible 
Facilities for hard of hearing
Consideration to less abled carefully thought through"
3629,"We found parking quite easy, I would have thought though that on busy days there would not be enough disabled parking for everyone."
3630,"I had booked the restaurant from 300 miles away, for a Special Occasion.
We called in to confirm details 2 days before.
I arrived , following a very unpleasant experience with Lothian Buses, my mobility aid, and that feeling of being a second class citizen because I (we) have some ""special"" needs. I suspect you know what I mean?)
We were greeted by the manager, Barbara, who offered a drink a seat and some sympathetic listening.
Which was just what this Doctor ordered!!!
She offered to change our table to the use of the entire downstairs in the restaurant.
Having inspected and realised that I was likely to manage the 2 flights up, we settled on upstairs, as ablutions were more easily accessible
So we arrived on the allotted day! All the arrangements were in place;
A glass of prosecco as guests arrived, the menu was fixed to deal with my diabetic and gluten sensitive chums and family
The menu is set. 
2 courses for a very reasonable price, service was friendly and attentive. The meal was not rushed allowing the family enough time to chat ,& change seats between courses to mix the group!!! , We even had a third course of Chocolate cake to suit all!!!! thanks to Loraine!!!
I really could not have been happier or had better experience for my birthday celebration/ cum retirement.
"
3631,Was a great night in this venue only downside is trying to find it 
3632,"A stunning old school cinema with tones of soul , recently refurbished , happens to be really accessible oppose to what many would think (2/3 screens are wheelchair friendly) parking might be a little tricky as situated on a busy street but a drop off spot available."
3633,There are public toilets at the top end of the car park. The disabled toilet needs a radar key but I didn’t use it so can’t confirm what’s inside.
3634,Lots to see and do.
3635,"Over all the access is good however the door in from the Street on Buchanan St is on a hill this is due to the street its self and has some steps. If you can make it to the top of the hill and on to Bath St it is level there to access the doors.
Of course the layout of each store is  very different in each case"
3636,"The Trevi Fountain is absolutely worth a visit if you're travelling to Rome, but you won't be alone. Steps down to the water edge mean that the fountain itself isn't particularly accessible, but it is easily viewed from standing a bit further back in the square."
3637,"Thanks to Nicole the Sundance Rep. for her help - especially in finding out where and when the local football matches were being held. We book regularly with Irene at Sundance Villas as she tells it how it is, and also arranged for this grab rail by the pool, which you cannot see in the photos."
3638,A member of staff met us at the gate and we could drive all the way down to the path and park next to the cabin and beach.
3639,"Completely flat and totally accessible leisure centre. 2 radar key toilets at either end. Cafe near the pool and reasonable priced sandwiches, coffee, cakes etc. Large room for swimmers, large changing room by the gym. Warning the gym stinks sometimes of BO!!!!

"
3640,"There is disabled parking near the stage which you have to book in advance or you can do what we did and spend the night at the nearby Premier inn, 5 mins walk away.To come from the train station is difficult as a long walk or by taxi which can't drop you nearby so still a walk."
3641,"Level access into the bar from the street through double doors. Once inside, It was easy enough to get around and the staff helped to rearrange the tables and chairs, as we arrived with 2 wheelchair users in our party, with no fuss."
3642,We drove to Southampton and used the blue badge parking spaces offered by the parking company. On our return our car was very close to the terminal - delightful.
3643,"There is a Ladies toilets and a gents each with with several cubicles,  these are not disability friendly.  There is a small disabled toilet, with grab rails, but it would be difficult to manoeuvre a chair around in and is a squeeze to have a carer and a large chair.  The second toilet is much better. very large.  tracking hoist. changing bed. shower, toilet chair.  toilet seats.  only problem is the toilet door is a wide door, but the hallway door is standard door.  the changing toilet can be in high demand when the building is busy."
3644,"The hotel public spaces such as the breakfast room,bar and restaurant were fully wheel chair accessible .
The groundfloor bedroom and ensuite wheel in shower room were also fully wheelchair accessible . A lovely clean quiet hotel with good facilities for a wheel chair user. Helpful and friendly staff."
3645,"Level access into the restaurant, would be made even better with a push pad automated door. Once inside you waited to be seated and there are two levels to the restaurant. Lots of movable seats, and a lift to upstairs. The restaurant isn't very brightly lit and is perhaps a little dim, but not too dark. Service is table service, and if you're in a hurry you can pay for your bill using the Wahaca app! "
3646,"The pub has a large tarmac car park with several blue badge spaces. The car park is on a slight hill, but the disabled spaces are on the level. There is room to drop someone off if these spaces are occupied."
3647,"They only staff member was the person at the ticket office. Staff at the ticket office could see I walked with a crutch but didn't advise me how inaccessible the venue was.

In the archives the staff were very helpful."
3648,"It’s just 3.5 miles out of Stratford apon Avon, and we parked to the right of entering property, with just two parking bays, but other bays available as well. "
3649,"An adapted toilet is inside the shop. However, the toilet is tight but manageable."
3650,Friendly attentive staff
3651,"The original disabled loo is not adequate ,the new one is."
3652,"There is standard disabled toilets meaning it is just bigger than a usual toilet. There was no hoist and there was only a babies changing table.
The toilet was clean."
3653,Enough space for a wheelchair and carer. Spotlessly clean. Wide doors and enough grab rails.
3654,Good overall accessibility.
3655,This is quite a niche museum on the Royal Mile with a very friendly feel. They clearly take an interest in accessibility.
3656,"Access to the hotel is good. There is automatic doors at the entrance and then carpet flooring all the way to the reception however the reception desk is not a wheelchair height so I had to get someone else to book us in. Then there is a lift up to the rooms and our room had an large door, large bathroom, large bed and a TV."
3657,"It's amazing! There is an accessable walk which is completely wheelchair accessible just a bit harder in some places but it's ok.
The bird hide even had a cut out so you can actually get to the window more easily.
The building and cafe is mostly accessable with cut outs so you can fit under the till to pay and see what to eat.
The maps don't have braille but one of them is tactile.
All the staff wore masks and there is hand sanitizer at every entrance.
The disabled toilets are locked so you need a RADAR key or ask a member of staff. I've attached photos of what it looks like. But there is a shower, two emergency cords, hospital bed, toilet with arm supports and hand free flushing, an adjustable sink (it has a control thing so you can make it go up or down) a foldable partition so you can have privacy if you need a carer and a lifting sling if you can't use your legs but need the shower. It has a lot of room to move around too."
3658,"I knocked off a star because of the backwards gallery I mentioned previously, this is something that could be so easily remedied but has clearly not occurred to able bodied curators. "
3659,"There's a good accessible loo just around the corner from the Cafe. You have to pass through a glass door and this is quite heavy; you may need a hand to get through if you're a wheelchair user. 

The toilet is large, well appointed, and clean."
3660,The accessible parking is right next to the accessible entrance. A lift then takes you to the galleries. There is plenty of room to move around and see the exhibits and art. Helpful staff are on hand to open doors but it is mostly open plan. There are accessible toilets available.
3661,"Built as a hotel in the 19th century, it still retains an elegant timeless luxury, one of the finest 4 star hotels in Surrey, overlooking the Broadwater lake, and here you will find manicured gardens, while the hotel itself boasts 144 refurbished contemporary stylish bedrooms, some with beautiful views over the countryside.
This historic house stands on the site of a Royal Palace that belonged to King Henry V111, and became a hotel in 1856, set in 10 acres of grounds which has been added 
to over the years in a variety of styles, with wooden panelling being a highlight along corridors and stairs. A large domed glass roofed lobby bathes the area with natural light, while large windows will impress you.

(Parts of the historical notes below are our own research, and added too by kind permission of Oatlands Park, who allowed us to use parts of their historical notes they provide for guests to read)

History indicates that the original house on the estate, Oatlands Palace, was built by sir Bartholomew Read, but following his death in 1505, his heir allowed Katharine of Aragon to use it as when when needed, but following her death, and then other successive Queens who lived here, it became known as a Royal house.
By 1537, King Henry V111 bought Oatlands estate, and a large luxurious palace was built for his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, and it became a much loved Tudor palace, and was the most modern and comfortable of all the royal country houses. The imposing red bricked building was built with gateways, octagonal towers and open courts, but Henry only visited occasionally. His wife Anne of Cleves proberbly never even lived here as only married for a short while.

After King Henry’s death, Edward V1, and then Queen Mary became residents of the palace. But it was King Henry’s daughter, now Queen Elizabeth 1st who spent a lot of money and time to make the house more comfortable, as a hunting lodge.
Following her death her successor King James 1st and his Queen, Anne of Denmark, also spent a lot of money in reconstructing the building, and formed “The Kings Silk Works” where silk worms were bred to provide silk for weaving.
Now his son the next owner King Charles 1st appointed a John Tradescant the elder as “Keep of his Majesty’s Gardens”  and he brought many rare plants from around the world, and planted some of them in the gardens. In 1647 King Charles 1st is imprisoned here until his execution.
When King Charles died, his son Henry, who was born at Oatlands, took over charge, and again developed the property, and the ancient Cedar tree alongside the main drive is believed to have been planted 1640/1650 in his memory, when he received the title pDuke of Newcastle.

However, the civil war meant that the palace was demolished by Oliver Cromwell, then in 1649 the whole estate was sold to Robert Turbridge, and by 1660 nothing remained standing except a few garden walls, and much of the materials from it were used to build the locks and bridges of the Wey Navigation canal, the first canal to be built in England.
But records did show that in 1652 a small hunting lodge still stood here.
By 1689, Arthur Herbert, Earl of Torrington gains the property, but when the Earl dies in 1716 the estate is bequeathed to the 7th Earl of Lincoln, and he laid out the long lawned terrace that still remains today.
His son, Henry, Duke of Newcastle rebuilds and enlarges the house, and the coat of arms at the main gate is in honour of the Duke.

An interesting part of history is now mentioned from records of Oatlands, that in 1716 the property is leased to the son of King George 111, who was prince Frederick, who is believed to be “The grand Old Duke of York” in the nursery rhyme.

Then following the English civil war, much restoration took place, but after a fire broke out in 1794 the present gothic style hotel was built.
After the death of the Duke in 1827, the estate was then bought in 1827 by Edward Hughes, before he pulled down large parts of the building, making many alterations, but to cover his debts it was put up for auction and leased as three parts of the original property, to the poet Lord Francis Everton, who lived here until the 1850’s, and during 1856 James Watts Peppercone, who had also bought parts of the house, used it as the South Western hotel, when the Tudor Wing is added.

In 1916 the war department requisitioned Oatlands, and used it for a period as a casualty hospital for the New Zealand forces that were serving in France.
Following World War One it was bought in 1924 by mr M.F.North and mr R.W.Black, and they developed it as North hotels, and a restaurant was added along with a ballroom.
Barclays associate hotels then owned the property until mid 1986, and then Oatlands investment Ltd acquired the hotel in 1986 as it gained a grade 11 listing along with the grounds, which are included in the register of Gardens and Parks of special historical interest.

So what is the hotel all about ?
Well, the very historical and delightful hotel has 144 bedrooms, now refurbished which offer a choice of old or new styles, some very classy, elegant, with rich fabrics, individually designed with timeless character and charm.
The Mulberry restaurant has that classic sense of elegance in a modern design, with pillers, a high ceiling and well appointed furnishings, and the room overlooks the Broadwater lake and parklands. 
The 1509 bar, so named after the year King Henry V111 was crowned, specialises in intriguing cocktails.
La Terrazza is the entertainment spot to aim for with live music events.

The hotel is well able to look after disabled, with a ramp at the entrance if needed, with two accessible bedrooms with a wet room, and handrails and pull cord. It has a lift, and is wheelchair friendly throughout, just an old bit here and there, and disabled public toilet is available for you.

OUR REVIEW
A very pleasant driveway led up to the hotel (photo 1) where we saw a lovely area with the beautiful blossom tree guiding us towards the car park (photo 2) and what 
we assumed would be the famous old Cedar tree of 1640/50 planted in honour of Henry, the Duke of Newcastle. (3) Three disabled bays lay outside the entrance to the hotel, (4) with its beautiful facade, where a  pull handled double door awaited, with an inner push door took us into the delightful reception lounge (5) 
Immediately a feeling of luxury invites you in, (6) and this is a very pleasant large open space, plenty of seating, room for wheelchair to move around and be placed out of the way when needed with very plain deco but suited it well and gave it that very plush appearance, while the reception desk sits in this delightful setting (7)

but it’s a very plain reception desk, overlooked by three clocks telling the time in 
three different countries of the world, New York, London and Paris (8).
A beautiful chandelier which looked so in place (9) over the attractive wrought iron work on the landing, and below a view of one of the many Olive trees they have in .
A grand piano stood in an annexe close to reception, (10) where you can imagine light music being played in the evenings.
Beyond, a pleasant practical Bar ready to serve a drink or two (11) with a comfortable pleasing area to sit and enjoy, while your drink, or perhaps a coffee will be brought over to you (12).
The disabled public toilet stands near (photo 13) which was very clean, practical, appealing colour scheme, with hand rails, a toilet roll holder at chest high that’s so easy to get a hold of (14) and you have room to spin the wheelchair.

The beautifully wood panelled passages can be seen in many areas (15) while being led towards the restaurant, (16) which is opulent and inviting (17) and this morning they are preparing for a lunch (18) looking delicious.
Near to the restaurant, we found a private dining room (19) which of course can be used for your private particular occasion, and hanging all around you are paintings with water as their theme, (20) highlighting the beautiful room.

OUR FINAL THOUGHTS
A delightful, luxuriant hotel, mainly wheelchair friendly, spotlessly clean throughout.
We enjoyed our early afternoon visit very much, and we highly recommend you to also visit this elegant hotel."
3662,"The wetroom was well laid out with a raised toilet with supporting handrails.  It was nice to have a separated hand basin beside the toilet to avoid having to go over to the main basin.  Of which, there was lots of room around the main basin as well as a glass shelf to put things on.  
As I require a seat to use whilst at the hand basin, we requested one from the reception, which was supplied straight away.
The shower had a pull down seat and supporting handrails.  Easy to use controls made showering easy, although my wife thought I was daft when I described the water flow as being ‘lumpy’  by this, I meant that the water flow was somewhat variable and seemed to come out in lumps at times."
3663,"There is a flat entrance from George Street into the restaurant. Once inside there are a large number of seats on the ground floor, either booths which are to the right or tables on the left. They have seating on a balcony level, however there is no lift up to this level. I always book to avoid disappointment, as it can be a very busy place."
3664,Flat throughout on one level. Good space between exhibits to get around
3665,"Very good shows on including some by disability theatre company lung ha. good parking & bus routes, lift and toilets available, friendly staff, good cafe."
3666,"This is one of around 35 hotels reviewed for you, and we base each review on just visiting for a drinks break, spending up to an hour or so just relaxing over a drink or two.  We of course have stayed at a few overnight, but our purpose is to encourage disabled people to see these hotels and spend a bit of time in comfort rather than in a usual high street coffee brand, where it’s usually full, people coughing all over you, tired  misarable faces, so why not try something better, you deserve it. 

This is One of our favourite hotels as completely disabled friendly, excellent caring staff, ideal spot for airport parking, very good menu and bar drinks, and good overall breakfast bar. You are spoilt for choice of airport hotels at East Midlands, but if you like that little extra, then we recommend this Radisson Blu hotel.

We approached the hotel through a well laid out industrial estate (photo 1) and found a large car park (photo 2), and close to entrance are three disabled bays (photo 3).
The entrance is on the level (photo 4) with automatic sliding doors.  As you enter, you are greeted with a huge open area, spotlessly clean, shiny marbled floor, plenty of seating areas and very inviting. At the far end was the bar (photo 5)  and we ordered coffee and relaxed while waiting for drink to be brought to us, rather slow service, but they were busy. (photo 6).
Beyond the bar is the good sized restaurant (photo 7) with dark modern decor, and it’s breakfast bar (photo 8).
In a corner alcove by the main door are two lifts, which are card controlled, so only staying guests can use these lifts (photo 9). Opposite the lifts is the reception desk for the Spa facilities (photo 10). In the Gym are treadmills (photo 11) and also weights (photo 12). A good sized swimming pool looks inviting (photo 13).

The meeting rooms are along a beautiful highly polished tiled floor and carpeting (photo 14) where hot food is provided for those attending meetings (photo 15).
Behind the reception are the toilets (photo 16) with plenty of room inside disabled, beautifully tiled, with pull cord and grab rails (photo 17).

Our final thoughts
This was our second visit this year, and we were not disappointed as it still has that wow factor. Every single member of staff were extremely friendly and helpful, going out of their way to help us.
Of all the hotels in East Midlands airport area, we would recommend this one, it’s completely wheelchair friendly.

If you enjoyed our review, would you be kind enough to click the. “I like” button, as this will encourage us to continue writing reviews for you. Thank you for your support. 
And when you have the chance, try reading our reviews of the older hotels, as we include historical facts for you, so as to enjoy reading about the hotels, even if you feel you will never visit."
3667,"Entrance is through wide double doors with step-free access. The doors are not automatic, but if you require assistance with these I did notice a buzzer clearly labelled with Dovecot outside the door. Once inside you are in the shop which is spacious and incredibly interesting. To your right is the main exhibition room which itself is massive. The current exhibition features jewellery and has a low stand with bangles which guests can try on. To the left of the shop is the cafe which is welcoming, cosy and has moveable chairs. The entire venue is bright and light there is a lift to all floors. Upstairs is the viewing balcony for the weaving studio, and I had this all to myself today! Absolutely serene and I can't stress how spacious this area is. Could have stayed for ages. Interpretation panels were all at a good height and there were benches all around the balcony if you needed a rest."
3668,"Completely wheelchair accessible, though a bit tight for wheelchairs in places but helpful staff and good food"
3669,"The staff were nice enough they just said it as it was they were not rude just direct to the point. As sorry we can not leave the counter to put out the ramp as there is only two people working . And when the dishwasher was broken they were sorry it was paper cups which some disabled people cannot use nor can the elderly. So instead of putting up a sign they tell you when you have been waiting  for ages to be served.
"
3670,"there are plenty of portaloos, including accessible ones."
3671,amazing exhibits
3672,"Apart from the parking this newly refurbished train station is a vast improvement on the old one. Flat access, bright and airy, disabled turn styles, large disabled toilets, lifts to all platforms and helpful staff. It's also very easy to navigate your way around."
3673,The staff made my visit. The warm welcome and the time spent explaining the building and it purpose was enough to make me decide to have a return visit to explore further!
3674,"Very good access with level access entrance though having to go through two sets of doors. 
Once inside it has several different areas all with good access. There is also another lounge upstairs which can be accessed via a good sized lift. 
At the back of the bar is a beer garden which is raised and can be accessed by a fantastic wheelchair lift. The beer garden is ""carpeted"" with astro turf making it easy to get around."
3675,I used a mobility scooter and got around the whole site. Some of the buildings weren't accessible without using a step or two. Not many are fine on a scooter though you can get a good sense of the place getting to the outside of each  section.
3676,Front door and doorbell totally inadequate for wheelchair users - apart from that I rate this vet practice very highly
3677,"There is lift access to both platforms and a low, wide ramp (indoors!) beneath the railway line. There is a fantastic large tactile map with Braille directions beside the ticket office which describes access around the station, including the locations of ticket machines, toilets etc. The stairs all have bright yellow edging as well, and there are very clear, loud audio announcements as each train is about to arrive."
3678,Excellent staff and were always on hand as soon as you needed them. Appeared at the interval to ask if we needed to be taken to the toilet and again at the end. 
3679,I drove to the beach car park on Beach Road. It’s a Pay and Display Car park although you can pay by card ( instructions on the Pay and Display machine). The car park is large and mainly hard standing. There are a very limited number of Blue Badge spaces but if you don’t need one of those there was ample room to park early on in the day.
3680,Helpful but not a hassle in anyway. Made no fuss but made things easy - that is quite an art.
3681,Didn't real meet staff but understand cafe staff helpful.
3682,Staff are extremely helpful and hardworking. They are really passionate about providing a good service and making sure costumers have a positive experience.
3683,"There is on street parking all around this area, however public transport is probably easier in this location. The number 16 Lothian bus stops close by the restaurant, and there are dropped kerbs at the road crossings."
3684,"This was my first experience of a changing places facility, a spacious room with an adult size lowering hospital bed, and a washbasin that also could be lowered. The main eatery is now a Cornish Pasty outlet. The chairs are comfortable, many with arms making them easy to get out of . Plenty of room to get around  the tables. Behind the Services is a small lake with geese and other waterfowl. There is a gravelled path, but the surface is often waterlogged"
3685,"Situated on the basement and on the top level. We only used the basement one. It was well-equipped with grab rails round the loo (side transfer possible from one side - right as you face the loo - only) a wheelchair-accessible washbasin, reasonable space to manoeuvre and one of those excellent alarm cords which are strung right round the room (apart from the doorway) about 18"" above ground level. It would be within reach wherever in the room someone might fall. Hope they catch on on the UK."
3686,"They had a loop system, signage could be better, ground was accessible and there was room to move around."
3687,We drove to the restaurant. The town was busy but luckily we managed to find offstreet parking very close to the restaurant.
3688,"The staff were exceptional and very friendly. This is a small hotel and there seems to be a strong emphasis on good customer service and all staff spoke English. Reception was always staffed and very helpful. At breakfast there was waitress service for hot drinks an self service for cold drinks and food, the lady was very efficient, one day she swapped the chairs around so I could have  firm chair and she always asked how I was and what my plans were for the day. When I requested a bath mat this was dealt with quickly and willingly."
3689,didn't see any staff
3690,see above
3691,"Large, easily accessed well appointed toilet."
3692,Easy to get around hotel and room was well equipped
3693,"Access was easy - a low door sill and a door that opened outwards - not that we ever needed to open it. The staff here are very alert and courteous and were quick to help. The restaurant is spacious so the circulating spaces are very good and there's plenty of room for a wheelchair. we were assigned a very nice table for two in a window, with a view of the square."
3694,"Interesting drive to get to hotel, and once there we found a large car park with disabled bays close to hotels entrance"
3695,"Terrible. Really bad attitude. Could not be bothered accomodating anyone with additional needs. Tutted, sighed, rolled eyes, slammed cutlery down, whipped menus out of our hands."
3696,"Intu shopping centre has a large car park with several different entrances depending upon which way you approach the city. The car park has several levels and each has a number of disabled spaces situated close to the entrance and the lifts down to the shopping levels of the centre. 
The bus station is not far from the centre if walking (approximately 5 minutes) with access available directly onto the ground floor."
3697,"Toilets are basic and outdated, but work fine and are easy to locate. Grab rails and red cords dangle to the floor (even in the steam room of the swimming pool). "
3698,5 disabled parking spaces near the entrance.
3699,Staff are helpful and very friendly.
3700,"There is disabled parking close to the doors, there is a lift up to the clothes department and everywhere is flat with minimal bumps. There is a bus to Dobbies from Perth."
3701,The venue has a car park with spaces for disabled visitors. The surface of the car park is flat and firm. There is also a frequent bus which drops you right at the entrance. 
3702,Great castle with interesting visitor centre and magnificent views!
3703,"Parking is very challenging, particularly in festival time. Nearest I think is George Square if you're lucky enough to find a space, or other option is Buccleuch street."
3704,"Not much room even in my lightweight sports chair. Shared with baby change - this took up the room. Power assisted door wasn't working, not a problem for me but maybe others? Staff logged it straight away when I informed them."
3705,"Disney's Animal Kingdom is recognised world-wide, therefore becomes extremely busy during peak holiday times. Although Disney's Animal Kingdom provides disabled parking spaces for guests who choose to drive, I would recommend using the resort's bus transportation. Every bus included is adapted to fully accommodate wheelchair users and prioritises guests, which require these services to the front of the queue. Unfortunately this is only available for a limited amount of spaces per journey. Every driver I had met was extremely friendly and patient and no task was too much trouble. As well as visual indication, the driver would announce every stop for each hotel and theme park, which would be beneficial for guests with visual and hearing disabilities. All stops were opposite the main entrances. "
3706,"A meeting place for students & staff of the university, but we found it was open to the public. Good place for a snack when visiting Old Aberdeen, close to Cruickshank Botanical Garden, St Machar's Cathedral, King's College & King's College Museum."
3707,A beach with boardwalk access and beach friendly wheelchairs available to borrow for free that your able bodied friend / family member can wheel you down the beach a into the sea. 
3708,"Spacious room, automatic door, super wet room and pet friendly! A couple of little things which would make it 5 stars are, a longer hairdryer cord as some would struggle to use it so short and if they'd remove the rug under the bed as this slightly affected our ability to transfer (stand aid on wheels). Bed is quite high which was ok for my husband to slide board transfer but some might struggle if using slideboard. Overall brilliant though! "
3709,In busy Cavern Quarter - public transport 5-10 mins walk away
3710,"We use a wheelchair and the wide flat paths are excellent. Several different paths so you don't have to take the same route every time you go. The Helix connects with the Kelpies so how much you do and how far you go can be varied. Car parking is good, especially now the first car park has a better surface, but not enough disabled spaces. Accessible Toilets and cafes at the Lagoon and at the Kelpies visitor centre (although the cafe at the Lagoon is seasonal opening).  Only 2 real downsides for us: 1) access to the canal towpath is really steep and whilst just about possible with a lot of huffing and puffing by the pusher, it's not really that accessible which is a real shame as the canal path itself is great; 2) no chance to hire a mobility scooter which would be a real bonus. Very dog friendly."
3711,"Level, smooth access throughout. No carpet and good space between all tables. Excellent to see a variety of table shapes, styles and heights ( and chair styles).  Staff have been good with communication when my speech wasn't clear, polite and attentive. I've heard one or more staff signs in BSL. Easy read menu with small portion options.  Staff who know me have included a straw with my drink. These things plus great food makes us go back regularly. "
3712,Unfortunately the Filmhouse doesn't have a parking area but public transport is regular and close to the venue.
3713,"As this is a general review of the area visited there were many accessible toilets, well signposted, clean and tidy, big enough to take a scooter straight in. I did not come across any changing places toilets at all."
3714,"Fun enthusiastic group, great hospitality."
3715,Friendly and attentive staff.
3716,"Access is generally very good. The square is mostly flat and where there are steps there are also slopes. There is a lack of drop kerbs. Often they are on one side of the road but not the other and where the exist they are lowered rather than dropped, see photo.
The square has a large park area, in which there is a Victorian Bandstand, the Maitland Rotunda and a few other monuments. There are plenty of benches, so of which are in the shade. There is a car park area near the Cricket Pitch, and where the horse drawn carriage ride, this was a little tricky to navigate with my crutch."
3717,No parking at venue but there are numerous smaller car parks around the area
3718,The parking is in front of the property on the gravel forecourt.  The owners were happy to clear a path for us which made access much easier. 
3719,"There is a multi store car park attached to the shopping centre it has Blue badge spaces available. Access from the car park to the centre is via a lift.
The nearest Tram Stop will be the Tower this is a few minutes walk away ."
3720,"There was an accessible toilet downstairs next to the entrance, which was clean and a good size. There was also another accessible toilet upstairs next to the restaurant, which was a good size as it provided enough space to move around. Grab bars were both fixed and pull-down next to the toilet and sink. I was able to hang a red cord card on the emergency cord."
3721,Good but could be better in parking and wheelchair accessibility.
3722,"Once you pass through the wide double doors the large, almost industrial, space is very striking. Plenty of room to wheel around, to sit and dine, and to enjoy the warmth of the log basket as it fills the space with a hint of smokiness."
3723,It was fairly easy to find but far away from the main rooms
3724,"Very helpful, friendly, offered assistance to carry our breakfast tray and drinks
Accessible restaurant with great breakfast "
3725,"There is a step free entrance to the gardens. The large gates were already opened when I visited. There are brick paved pathways throughout the garden. Some of the bricks are uneven, so take care, and part of the garden is on a short but noticeable slope. The path is mainly step free, there was only one area I noticed with steps and these did not have a handrail. Some of the pathways are rather narrow, which may make them unsuitable for wheelchair users. The plants sometimes have grown onto the path. I found a couple of places very narrow for me an my crutch. It was not a deal breaker but I felt I had to mind my footing in a couple of places. The gardens are compact but were more spacious than I first thought, as they stretch back. The further you go into the gardens the more wooden bench seating you find. There is a lot of seating. "
3726,"Had a lovely meal for my dads birthday, very good food and good portions. Service was a little bit slow as it was very busy but we were all happy and they were really friendly

Access summary: Narrow-ish doorways and may need help getting to the loo, but all flat or sloped. I managed all fine and had a lovely time- just would recommend not going alone."
3727,"The drive here was spectacular. Worth it for the drive, think scenery with a good cafe thrown in."
3728,"I was very impressed at the number of lifeguards there were at all areas of the Park and how attentive they were.
In several places there are lifeguards actually standing in the water, not just looking on from a distance.

The park is extremely clean, considering how many people visit it, there is no rubbish or anything left lying about. There are staff cleaning constantly.

All staff I spoke to were helpful.
"
3729,The Cinema is in a great location as it is part of Intu Derby Shopping Centre. As part of cinema there is a restaurant on the same floor and is easily accessible for wheelchair users.  The cinema can be accessed by lifts and escalators. The cinema is very spacious and has disabled toilets on both floors. There are plenty of disabled car parking spaces in the different car parks to access the shopping centre.
3730,The stalls are accessible and a great height for wheelchair which made it a very enjoyable place to visit.
3731,Car park is sizeable.  No problems here.
3732,"Nope, everyone kept  telling me to come back, all the events were fully taken up by groups, no room for a singleton.  I never got to do anything, I could've done trampolining but it messes up my balance when I stop! Everything else, fully booked all the time I was there.  Complete waste of time going if you're on your own."
3733,Great - we parked right outside the door! Not sure what public transport is like to get to the Ferry Terminal when on the island.
3734,"The staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful, they will assist you with the doors if required. "
3735,"I'm giving it 5 stars as we never had trouble parking, but i'm not sure how many spaces there was as it was usually covered in snow."
3736,The building has smooth marble floors and ramped access at the front so should be find for all wheelchair and powerchair users.
3737,"Not got its own parking, there is parking a few minutes walk away, and so is the bus station. "
3738,The staff are very helpful in accommodating for needs. A room on the bottom floor can be given. Recommendation of entertainment and an accessible seat in the restaurant are also available.
3739,"Cosy Duddingston pub that's, very old and even has its own vintage skittle alley! Access is good considering this pub is around 600 years old, but be aware doorways can be a bit narrow."
3740,"As a holiday retreat Cambushinnie is excellent. Our family has stayed in a number of holiday homes in the UK and Europe. From an accessibility viewpoint this is one of the best. Generally the location is great, the facilities excellent and the owners clearly committed to giving visitors a great experience."
3741,"This is a modern hotel, which shares a building with student halls of residence, different entrance though.  It is only a leisurely ten minute walk from the railway station, with not many obstacles for a wheelchair user apart from one or two footpaths that didn't have conveniently placed drop kerbs.

The elevators were of a new design, when you use them for the first time you scan your room key-card on the outside and one of the three elevators takes you to the correct floor, without the need for selecting the floor.  Well, in theory anyway!  As it happens, we were on the seventh floor; when I asked for an additional key-card for the room lights, Danni gave me one that was already on the desk, and it must have been programmed for a ninth floor room as that is the floor it selected. Fun and games ensued as I stepped out of the elevator to scan the correct key-card and up it went, with my wife and the luggage but not me. And so, with no key-card and no way to select a floor from within the elevator, she had to rely on other guests to use their key-card to get her back to the ground floor.  Oh, how she laughed .....NOT!

After the missus had brayed me, we made our way to our room, which was close to the elevators; there was plenty of room in the corridor to approach the room. Now, of all the accessible rooms we have stayed in at Premier Inn, some have been big and some not so.  This one though was MASSIVE!  At its widest and longest points it was 28ft by 13ft.  There was plenty of room for my wife to manoeuvre her wheelchair; in fact, there was enough room to invite other wheelchair users and host a disco.  We were located on one corner of the building and, although we were near to the elevators we could not hear them. The adjoining wall between us and our only neighbour was about twenty feet from our bed; consequently, we did not suffer with noise disturbance.
The room had two large floor-to-ceiling windows with privacy glass, allowing daylight to flood into the room during the day.  At night the heavy blackout curtains plunged the room into total darkness. The A/C was very quiet and very good; much needed as in Bournemouth those few days it was mafting (that's hot, if you're not from Hull).

The king size bed was made up of two single zip and lock beds, which are always uncomfortable in the middle. As such, I always call ahead to ask that a duvet is placed under the bed sheet as a mattress topper; that wasn’t in place when we checked in so I had to ask for one to be brought to our room, along with extra pillows; they arrived promptly. The height of the bed, at 50cm, was at an appropriate height for my wife to transfer from her wheelchair.  
The pillows at Premier Inn are sometimes like biscuits; in this hotel though they were really plump and very comfortable.  The mattress, with makeshift topper applied was really comfortable.

There were plenty of electrical sockets in the room including at least one with a USB charger. Under the TV was a HDMI input, which is common in the new and refurbished rooms.  Note to self: remember the cable next time.  There was also plenty of lighting in the room.
The basic Wi-Fi was good enough for us, but if we wanted to cast to the smart TV we would have needed to shell out for the paid service, I reckon.

All in all, this was a great hotel with a fantastic accessible room; if we were to stay in Bournemouth again we wouldn't hesitate to use this hotel again.
"
3742,"Most of museum and outside surroundings are on same level. Lift in use to mezzanine floor to view speedway and motorcycle collection, and long shallow slope to the café area. And a slope to the 'red room' / Ferrari / Bentley collections.

 Interesting collection of both desirable supercars, and exhibits of cars that your father or grandfather might have owned. 

Café also had good choice of hot food, snacks and drinks."
3743,"The young staff were friendly and ready to answer questions, but they really shouldn't have let me queue a long time for one of the rides only to tell me when I got to the front that the stair lift wasn't working that would have lowered me down into the ride.  Also, there was a big no-no at another ride when one staff member asked my partner in front of me ""Can she walk 10 metres"". I know this was just one busy person's mistake, but if Legoland are serious in their boast that they've built the part ""with disabled visitors firmly in mind"", they need to address this in their training."
3744,Amazing! Everything has been thought about - from the entrance to the different exhibits (some with their own platform lifts) to the full length glass viewing areas to the enormous lift to the information panels that have BSL - and much much more!
3745,Fantastic gardens with great access and helpful staff. Pre bookable mobility scooters and plenty of easy access toilets.
3746,"Boats to Saint-Honorat leave regularly throughout the year from Vieux Port at Cannes. There is step free access and spaces for wheelchair users. The boat trip takes about 15 minutes but check the schedule for the last boat of the day and be mindful there is a gap in the schedule over the lunchtime. On route to the island there are impressive views of La Croisette and the French Riviera coastline.
Please note tickets for the ferry can be bought online or at the kiosk at Vieux Port, which is accessible via stairs, although there is a step free route to boarding the bus. I visited in early October  and was surprised at the length of the queue to buy or collect tickets for the boat ride. I was worried that I would miss my planned boat (they are only once every hour) but the boat waited until everyone who was travelling was aboard so it left a few minutes late. This was my experience so don't assume they will do that when you are wanting to travel so please arrive early.
On the Cannes side the ticket kiosk and boat are located through a car park, just off a road where buses go by."
3747,Staff is always lovely and very helpfull.
3748,Special assistance staff were brilliant. Myself and other passengers were met off the plane and we didn't have to wait. The staff spoke good English and were helpful in taking me through to where my onward journey started.
3749,"I went in using my manual wheelchair.

It's completely level and smooth through the shop, Cafe & outdoor seating area. 

The plants are accessed via slopes/ramps to the outdoor area, but they are not at all steep and very easy to push up in a chair. I'm not strong at all and often need help with inclines but managed these by myself. "
3750,"Its rare that we go somewhere where everything we need has been thought of and an overnight stay is so easy. Accessibility has been beautifully integrated in the design so that its not a focal point, everything is just flows well. The cottages are incredibly spacious and very peaceful. We wanted to stay for longer and will most definitely be back!"
3751,"There is a disabled toilet but if I remember right, it isn't that great.  They have got a swing door to the toilets and that isn't really accessible if  the person is on their own."
3752,"Fitz Park provides a lovely flat tarmac, traffic free route to enjoy the mountain views.   It's a multi-functional park with a cricket pitch, football pitch, fantastic children's play area, stunning views, path alongside the river, benches and is popular with dog walkers.  It can get busy, and if you want to get out of the crowds you can access the quieter and more tranquil Upper Fitz Park either by crossing the road or by going under the bridge next to the river.  Upper Fitz Park includes beautiful trees, benches, flat tarmac path, tennis courts and bowling greens.

Cafe West is located in the main Fitz Park and provide a range of mainly tray bake cakes, hot and cold food and drinks and ice-creams.

Cafe West has one accessible toilet, and separate male and female toilets which can be used by anyone, but they do ask for a donation for use of the toilets if you are not a customer of the cafe.

The cafe is run by supported staff who have learning disabilities.  All staff are very friendly and the cafe is very disability aware.

Cafe West is dog friendly.

Parking is available at the far end of Fitz Park, just off Crosthwaite Road, in one of two car parks.  Alternatively there is  limited on-street parking on Station Road, next to Cafe West and the museum.

"
3753,"What was nice was that there were three disabled toilets each at a different level. One near the entrance, one by picnic area/cafe and one by the restaurant cafe on the top floor."
3754,Flat access with automatic doors. All great.
3755,Staff were very friendly and helpful. There is an information desk in the main part of the station where assistance can be found easily. There is also a member of staff on every platform to help with wheelchair transfers to the train and are very helpful with questions.
3756,"Wide door and good circulation space. Entry, exit and lock is via a light touch  button on the wall. 
Side transfer should be from right to left but large nappy bin in the way. I asked for it to be moved. We will see what happens. Another reason why baby changing should NOT be in accessible toilets. "
3757,"From the Disabled car park to Ticket office all on one level, the surface is a bit bump in places. There is a land train (with a ramp) which takes you down to House, but it is only a short walk if someone was fit enough to push a wheelchair. (We have done this on previous visits) the disabled access is through the shop( the Ticket Desk advise you of this) Then there is a Chair lift up the stairs. Wheelchair users do have limited access but have plenty to see and do. The Staff keep you right on where to go with wheelchair."
3758,There are several buses that stop very nearby.
3759,"The boat was easily accessible for my husband's wheelchair. The chaps who took us out were very knowledgable and the information they passed on really enhanced our experience. We watched the sailing boats - and there were many of them - racing in the harbour. My hubby had the opportunity to drive the boat. It was a lovely bright, breezy day and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. When we orginally enquired, Tracey was very. very helpful to us. We had to cancel on the first attemtp because the weather was so bad but Tracey rebooked us and sorted everything out without fuss. When we arrived, they kitted us out with waterproofs and lifejackets. We really enjoyed this experience. We could not track down anywhere else in the area where we could get a wheelchair on a boat. And I searched and searched and enquired. Thank you, Mylor Sailing School."
3760,Nothing appeared to be too much trouble. All staff were very friendly and helpful.
3761,"Due to it being an old town, it is increadably steep every where the main high street is horrendous and this is where the main shops are."
3762,"This was our first of what I presume will be many visits to Homelands in Lundin Links, Fife - completely wheelchair accessible, it made it so easy for my disabled husband to enjoy his holiday. The lodges are beautifully furnished with everything you need for a relaxed and comfortable stay. There is plenty to do and see in the surrounding area - but we were always happy to return to our beautiful lodge and relax. I cannot rate this accommodation highly enough, including the staff at the hub who were so friendly and on hand to help in any way. This is a peaceful haven for anyone looking for an accessible holiday - and we were even able to include our family dog on our holiday!!"
3763,All staff and volunteers helpful and welcoming.
3764,"Very friendly, helpful and approachable."
3765,There is one toilet accessible for wheelchair users which is easy to locate and there is plenty of room to manoeuvre. Grab rails and aids are effectively placed and the toilet is kept clean.
3766,"The staff member who helped us in (plus her friend who happened to come in with us) could not have been nicer or more helpful and this really added to the experience of the Glastonbury magic for me.  She was sincere, kind, friendly and  really represented the Glastonbury spirit for me.  "
3767,"The Fashion and Textile Museum is a specialist fashion museum. It has no permanent displays but has temporary displays which as installed for about 3 months. During this visit I saw  Swinging London: A Lifestyle Revolution / Terence Conran – Mary Quant exhibition, which is on until 2 June 2019.

Updated November 2019:  Tweet from the Museum ""shortly after @TinaWalksLondon visited us earlier in the year, we resolved the issue regarding the emergency chord in our accessible toilet - thanks again for bringing this to our attention. """
3768,"Massive car park right beside the train platform for trains heading in the Edinburgh direction (platform 1). There is another, smaller car park beside the second platform (next to the post office), but it is on a fairly steep slope. There are buses on the main road beside the station with a long ramp leading down to platform 1. The car park isn't free."
3769,"All the staff at the centre are very helpful, from the catering staff to the outdoor activity team"
3770,Wheelchair accessible café located on the main high street of Broughty Ferry. Staff are friendly and food is delicious.
3771,"Sadly once again the disabled lift would not work, so had to go round the outside of the building to the other entrance"
3772,A great experience which wheelchair users can enjoy to the full. All visitors need to book in advance on-line - it's no good just turning up on the day.
3773,"Well signposted accessible disabled toilets. Adequate room for carer. A bit careworn, but adequate and reasonably clean."
3774,There is  a large carpark for customers travelling by car this includes disabled parking spots in close proximity to the entrance of the shop. There is a bike rack for cyclists and taxis pull up just outside the entrance of the shop.  There is a wide pathway for  pedestrians with textured paving in front of crossings for people with visual impairments.
3775,"There was not a lot of staff on site to help and assist. The only staff member was working in the gift shop. She was very helpful, however just one person alone was not enough."
3776,We drove. The Hayling Halt car park is loose large gravel that the car boot scooter couldn’t cope with. We had to park blocking a gate to unload the scooter directly onto the path.
3777,Lake with ducks and Ramp to the cafe and Ice cream place. Most of the Paths are suitable for disabled some may be inaccessible to people in wheelchairs with no helpers. Plenty of bench’s for people who struggle with walking.
3778,"In the venue was fantastic, on the way to the venue from the shuttle bus stop, at times was difficult finding a dropped kerb."
3779,"Although not very noticeable, there are limited blue badge parking spaces located at the back of the theatre, but the distance from the car park to the building is appropriate"
3780,"Toilets clearly signposted, no emergency chords in the toilets, they can be cold and unwelcoming. Not staffed.
Clean and tidy with enough room to move about"
3781,Access into the building is via a dedicated door and internal ramp. There's plenty of space and the furniture can be moved.
3782,"This garden centre has so much to see. Beautiful plants and well looked after, a huge array of gift options and a very nice restaurant. Disabled parking for cars right outside the entrance and also some just around the corner."
3783,"There are no toilet facilities for visitors in the Town Hall, except for wheelchair accessible toilets. However, on Lloyd Street is a public toilet with a Changing Places toilet with full facilities cords. This needs a RADAR key to access.  In addition are good clean disabled toilets, with grab rails, alarm cord, raised toilet and wheelchair height washbasin as well as good, clean ordinary male/female toilets. All free! Our guide warned us of all of this before our visit, so we came prepared. One of our number needed to use the disabled facilities in the Town Hall and this was accessed quickly."
3784,"This is a tiny little delicatessen located on Street Lane, that has the most divine food - they make everything fresh, and you can go there for any meal or just a snack. They also do takeaways if you fancy taking something home with you. 
As well as the food they make, they also have a cheese counter, a salad bar, deli and bakery, alongside a shop where you can buy delicious treats.

They have a ramp to allow access, as well as an outside seating area (for when it gets warmer). Unfortunately they do not have any customer toilets, so it needs to be a quick visit. It is a small cafe so sometimes when busy it is not accessible due to limited space to move around, particularly for people using mobility aids. 

Staff are incredibly friendly and will help with whatever they can. Always had a fantastic experience here. "
3785,Disabled spaces are located on level 3 of the car park near John Lewis
3786,"There is a ramp into the pub and a ramp up the raised floor in the pub. However, if an individual has a mobility need then they may not be able to access the booth seats as they are raised.
There is a braille menu and a lot of menus that are suited to different needs and preferences.
There are plenty of seats around the pub so that if an individual gets tired, they can easily take a break and rest.
"
3787,"Visited here after a recommendation and wasn't disappointed, staff were friendly and couldn't do more for you, excellent food, fresh and hot and a wide selection on the menu.

Very safe environment regarding COVID and overall a very clear establishment highly recommended "
3788,"Could not fault the staff, they had the observational skill, training and awareness to recognise the symbol cane."
3789,"The toilet is a good size and it is RADAR key. Shared with the baby change.
However, there are often people sitting right by the door so you will have to ask them to move when you need to open the door"
3790,"Great parking.  I have never used the public transport, but highly recommend the local park and ride into York.  One thing that might be an issue if your a wheelchair user on your own is the farm gate, but I am sure that Rod would help if you struggled opening and closing it.  They have always been great with me if I ever needed help."
3791,They are all doing an excellent service
3792,Staff are very friendly and helpful.
3793,"Unfailingly helpful, cheerful and polite. They are why we are going back."
3794,"The shop is set over two floors, only the ground floor is wheelchair accessible. The access into the shop is level (there is a glass door), and the counter is on the right. The counter is fairly high up. The ground floor of the cafe is a strange shape! It gets quite narrow in one point and then opens up again into a bigger area. There is a range of seating both at tables and sofa/armchair seating."
3795,There is no cost for the park but you have to pay for the parking and it is up to £8 for the day or £5 for 1-2 hours. Our advice to anyone with a wheelchair is to park in the smaller car park rather than the main visitor park.
3796,Staff friendly.  Table service.
3797,Can be tight to turn around wheelchair 
3798,"The access into the venue itself was perfect for me, with automatic doors available. Some of the seating in the cafe can make it a little difficult to get around but overall it’s fantastic. "
3799,"Lots of close by bus links, and close to the train station. You could also park in the co-op car park for up to two hours. Blue badge holders are also able to park just outside the chest and heart charity shop which is almost directly opposite the restaurant."
3800,Parking in this area is severely limited. A few bus routes pass nearby. Clapham Junction station is 1.2 miles away and is fully step-free. 
3801,"What a shame, this oldish hotel is looking out of place, it’s very shabby, unlooked after, Badly in need of maintenance both inside and outside, and our first thought was to get out of there, but we decided to give it a review anyway.

This 1850 built 3 star hotel was once a gentleman’s club, with 
a very large car park, holding space for 120 cars, but we did not see a disabled bay, although there is 
supposed to be one here somewhere. What we did find useful was a hand cleaning car wash, at reasonable cost, and lads did a great job for us.
The hotel is run by Regency (Shirley) Ltd from August 2021, but they obviously cannot care about the place.
The hotel has 111 bedrooms over 3 floors, we would not stop here, a restaurant and a bar, with views over a garden, but this needed attention.
It has a fitness centre, built in 1990, refurbished in 2009, with its own leisure centre, with a well equipped gym, steam room, sauna, so they say, we did not bother to find it.

HOWEVER, there is a very pleasant, clean looking, small independent TEA ROOM, presented by Laura Ashley offering a good afternoon tea, and if the look of the hotel did not put you off, it may be worth trying out.
Now let’s present you with OUR REVIEW OF HOTEL.
We approached via a busy road, and entered the car park area, (photo 1) but that alone was enough to put us off, and the whole front of the hotel looked shabby and unkempt. The entrance into hotel was round the corner (photo 2) but not appealing and the woodwork badly needs maintenance and painting. There is a ramp though for you (3) with a pull handle entrance on the level (photo 4) which led us to reception desk, (5) with someone there as well, BUT DO REMEMBER TO REGISTER YOUR CAR here.
A corridor (6) leads towards the bar, which was plain and simple with a few comfortable enough chairs (photo 7) and served a decent gin and tonic. A good sized restaurant is available (8) comfortable looking with nice views over garden area (9) but the terrace itself needs cleaning up all around (10).
A passage now leads towards the Tea room (11) but there are steps to have to get up (12) even if you entered from the car park area, but it was a nice looking tea room (13) designed with Laura Ashley deco, in subdued colours (14).
Toilets near by with a disabled toilet, (15) which is small with basic facilities (16).
Around the corner from reception is a small lift (17) just big enough for chair and carer, but no room to turn (18) which will take you up to bedrooms, tired looking corridor (19) in at least an effort to add modernisation to it, but we did not see a disabled room.
Then it’s back outside again for your journey to next visit.

In no way would we recommend this hotel to you, it badly needs attention before we would even consider doing so."
3802,Gorgie has good transport links and there is also a large parking area. It is also next to Gorgie McDonalds.
3803,"I did not see a disabled toilet but wasn't looking for one as I used one in the center before going on board.
I would surgest looking at their website or calling to get any questions answered. "
3804,"If you're a wheelchair user, you won't be able to get into the main entrance to this branch of Boots because it has two steps behind the door. Instead, use the concealed entrance in the shopping arcade to the left (see my picture below). Even then you will have difficulties, because the double doors are very heavy and you will need to open both of them to give enough width to allow a wheelchair to pass through. This is really very poorly thought-out, with no regard for the legal obligations imposed by the Equality Act 2010."
3805,friendly and helpful staff
3806,The toileting facilities were exquisite. 
3807,We went to Bannockburn not too sure what to expect and ended up having a really good morning here. The staff were very helpful and welcoming. There was lots of disabled parking and the exhibition and outside space was all very accessible. An added bonus was the cafe had lactose and gluten free options making a fantastic stop off point at the end! 
3808,"A new Mexican restaurant and tequileria on Lothian Road. Staff are great, and the atmosphere is fun! Overall, access appeared very good. Great new place in town."
3809,"The accessible toilets are easy to find, large enough to accommodate carers and wheelchairs and have appropriate grab rails , they are clean and tidy too."
3810,"We only used the toilets in the Peacock café but they were very clean and accessible , can't comment on other toilets within the park."
3811,"Parked in CAthedral car park disabled spaces are on 3rd floor
Accessible buses run through city centre only 20 yards from restaurant
All easy to get about
"
3812,Nothing is too much trouble. Welcoming and friendly
3813,"There are plenty of accessible toilets. However, I've yet to find one that I would describe as excellent. The toilet I used on this occasion was combined with a baby-change table. I couldn't reverse past the folded table into the wheelchair space as it was in the space, sticking out 8"" from the wall. Most other toilets have a sanitary bin blocking the space.

I haven't tried the ""High Dependency Unit"" (assuming this to be a ""Changing Places"" toilet) as you have to phone up centre management or go to the upper level concierge desk to request access. The HDU is on the lower level."
3814,"Being familiar with toilet standards, the space is very good and just needs an ostomy shelf. Unfortunately no hoist or adult changing bench. Baby changing is in this space but not intrusive (it's bigger than the UK standard. Clean and low level light."
3815,All the accommodation is on the ground floor with a tiled surface.  The living and kitchen area was larger than we had anticipated and we found it easy to bring in extra seating that we required.  The large bedroom was big enough for us to access easily with the wheelchair
3816,"There is a step at the door which depending on chair and skill level may be a problem. The service is quite slippy so I decided against making a second attempt of getting up the step and just had them bring food to me. 

The biggest issue for me is the only access up on to the pavement is a steep kerb or at the far end there is lowered section but everytime I go past that section has been blocked by a vehicle. I had to squeeze between the vehicle and the hole (see photo) to access which may prove impossible if larger chair. 

The counter inside is high and when there is no Covid they usually have some seating. The door is manual and is stiff to push open. 

You can order online at Just Eat. They do deliver for a fee. "
3817,"I cannot day enough good things about South Newlands Farm. This has been our sixth stay here. We travel from the USA  with varying numbers of kids with varying disabilities. (We adopt special needs kids) Rod and Peggy have been incredible over the years and really go the extra several miles to make our stay comfortable. It really is home from home for us. I am from the area so we come to visit family predominately so having somewhere to stay where family and friends can come and visit us is fantastic. As far as I am concerned, there is nowhere that meets the needs of the disabled community quite like here. "
3818,Drinks order taken as soon as we were settled at the table and the food order was taken after we had read the menu. No delay in service. Staff friendly.
3819,Staff as usual for John Lewis were exceptionally helpful.
3820,very helpful staff
3821,"No staff as such but stewards are about, however one feels there are never enough of them and they are in the wrong places.  Those that are around are helpful enough but overworked."
3822,Staff were very happy to help.
3823,Plenty of space and conveniently placed handrails. *note the toilets are accessed using a radar key*
3824,There are two publicly accessible disabled toilets through the reception area and to the left of the cafe. There is step free access to the building via the ramp on Holyrood Park Road. There are further disabled toilets in the changing village for swimmers.
3825,"Small, ground floor, 3 bedroom guest house in the heart of the Old Town Las Palmas.  The house is in traditional Spanish style, beautifully furnished with rooms located round a small courtyard. The attractions (cathedral, museums, Christopher Columbus house, traditional restaurants and cafes) of the old town are within a 5 - 10 minute walk and are located in a pedestrianised area where there are some cobblestone streets. 20 - 30 drive from Gran Canaria Airport."
3826,There is photographs 
3827,Every member of staff made the visit enjoyable. Most helpful.
3828,It's farmers field and to get pumpkins you need get on field but we managed with my son manual chair if someone helped him push.
3829,"Staff were great, nothing was too much trouble and would definitely do anything in their power to help & make things possible."
3830,"Could not have been any better. I really felt welcomed as part of the crowd. On leaving the viewing area at the end of the concert, I was slightly overwhelmed by the number of people making their way out. However I was pleasantly surprised to find that the lift to the car park was close by and guarded by a member of the security staff and I was able to return to my car without any hassle. "
3831,"The staff are polite, friendly and are usually happy to help you with anything you need."
3832,"There is no parking directly outside the students union, however there is disabled parking on the University site which is around a 5 minute walk. Although this is very limited and may take longer depending on the individual."
3833,Although the beach would only be accessible with difficulty the harbour walk more than made up for it .
3834,Site is fantastic Access. The building has access but is an old home and therefore not fully wheelchair accessible
3835,Could not fault the Salisbury Arms. Perfect evening.
3836,"Grangemouth Sports Complex houses two swimming pools the main pool has 6 lanes and is 25m. It accommodates recreational and competitive swimming, Aquafit and Zumba classes, as well as Life-Saving and Learn To Swim programmes.The Teaching Pool is adjacent to the main pool and provides a warm safe environment for children, toddlers, babies and parents. The pools weren't busy and had some inflatable toys. There are two flumes, The Blue (Cruiser) is a medium paced slide with a choice of music and touch pads enjoyed by me and my brother. Whereas the Red (Bruiser) is faster and has scary sound effects.There is a chair hoist for the disabled to get into the pool. The cafe has great food, a ramp for the disabled with a power assisted door , an average wait time and plenty of seats."
3837,Around the hotel and restaurant is good. The rooms are ok but only one has a wetroom which is a shame.
3838,They are very friendly and helpful
3839,They were good and very helpful.
3840,There was no signage for accessible routes though we found most of the paths and trails accessible. The map provided purports to have access info on one side but it is limited in its usefulness - for a start it only covers the central area around the cafe and some people want to go a bit further than that!    Different woods and trails had signs giving their names bit these didn't appear on the maps so it was difficult to plot where we were on this huge site.
3841,Disabled parking close to the restaurant.
3842,There was an accessible loo inside Sammy's: clean with OK rails but a bit small for wheelchair manoeuvring.
3843,"There is a big step at the front door, and a doorbell which - I was pleased to discover - does work. I'm not sure whether staff heard and reacted to the doorbell, because a random stranger went in to alert them to my presence outside, and then they were prompt to bring the ramp and let me in. 

The café is oddly laid out, all the ordinary tables and chairs are on a raised area, and it's cramped because all the tables and chairs are very close together - difficult to move around this area with a wheelchair.  In the lower area of the café it's all bar stools and high shelves. However, the staff had the excellent idea of redeploying the ramp to give me access to the raised area and the ordinary tables, and they ensured that a suitable easy-to-access table was vacated for me. "
3844,"The one accessible loo was a good size with all the rails I needed, and it was reasonably clean. Although I think it doubled up as a changing facility for babies, at least it wasn't being used by visitors without disabilities or babies - everyone else was queueing politely for the main loos."
3845,The ramp was brought out very promptly but the person in charge of entry to the dressing room area did not understand that some disabled people cannot wait what someone does the hair and make-up until they can use the toilet!
3846,Has slightly better access for wheelchairs than the Borrowash branch.
3847,"There are two main entrances - one to the Chocolate Lounge and exhibition, and one to the Chocolatier's Shop. Both are level access entrances, and although the doors aren't automatic, they are lightweight. The whole Chocolate Lounge is level access with low seating, movable furniture and plenty of space between tables and chairs. It is quite dimly lit throughout however. As you enter there is a viewing window to where the chocolate is made and a wide archway into the lounge where a friendly member of staff greets you. If you want to then go on through to the shop, there is a short flight of stairs with a wheelchair lift - however if you would prefer not to us this lift, you can exit the Chocolate Lounge entrance and follow the path (at a gentle gradient) around to the second entrance which has level access into the shop."
3848,"Not aware of any nearby parking.On Lothian Buses, the venue can be accessed easily by buses: 11, 36, 16, 47, 10, 34. X15, 124, 24, X5, 15."
3849,As a mode of transport it was great you’ve got to be able to walk up the gang plank.
3850,"The approach to the cinema is over flat ground, with wide access automatic doors. There is a lift and an escalator to the booking foyer."
3851,"In keeping with the general ambiance, staff were laid back but friendly and ammenable."
3852,"The front entrance has big automatic doors which allow for easy access. The lobby is clear of obstructions but is quite small. 

The Cinema is Lit well, the floor is even and slip-resistant. But the main reception is very noisy due to café in situ. This might cause problems with people with visual and audio impairments."
3853,"One of the toilets has an open plan, so is easily accessible. However, the cubicles are small. There is one disabled toilet which is usable for someone in a wheelchair. However, for a child with a complex disability, there is no space for a carer or two to toilet or wash the child."
3854,"If you want to obtain a visual Summary of the Dutch Culture and history, this is a great place to visit.  The museum contains approximately 8,000 pieces of art on display in a space of over 9,500 square meters.  You can easily spend a couple of days traveling from the 1100’s on floor 0 to modern day pieces on the third floor. This museum contains masterpieces from various famous artists…including Vermeer, Frans Hals, Van Gogh, and Rembrandt."
3855,"Ramps to get in all on the level doors are wide lifts within hotel , rooms are ok but could be improvements made in lay out, cannot easily get wheelchair on balcony easily"
3856,There were no steps from car park to the station. All level. Automatic doors on entering station. Compartments 1 and 6 have wheelchair access. We were a group of 8 with two manual wheelchair users (children) and there was no problem. 
3857,"Staff asked me if I wanted to use the ground floordisabled toilet as soon as I stood. It was kept locked so not used by other customers, so it might be a problem on a packed Saturday. But it was clean and spacious, no bins to restrict movement. "
3858,There are nearby bus stops & taxis drop people off nearby. There are some accessible tube stations in the area.
3859,"Largely accessible venue with pleasant, helpful staff and good, reasonably priced food"
3860,Conventional disabled toilet with handrails BS5810 standard. Room for carer. Right hand transfer.
3861,The toilet at the cottage was fully accessible
3862,Not signposted as accessible but they are level access through a narrow door at the back. Just enough space for myself in a wheelchair.
3863,"Just an update from the previous review - the accessible toilet did have a broken lock, this has now been fixed. It's still cramped and full of bins, but the lock works."
3864,Limited parking options given its in the centre of town on Princes street (theres a small amount of on street parking in charlotte square). Lots of buses and trams stop near though.
3865,Automatic doors at entrance. Toilet with wheel chair access on ground floor. Lift access to all floors.
3866,Friendly. Many are volunteers
3867,"There is little vehicular traffic in the park (though lots of people on bikes and children on scooters) so it's fairly safe to walk in any of the roads inside the park. Pavements are wide, but beware of tall kerbs. Kerb drops exist at certain points allowing a wheelchair user to move conveniently between kerb and road. It's not always easy to navigate the considerable bump between the road and the sandy path. 

Signage is good and includes signs to toilets.

There is a café but I didn't go near it because I visited during the Covid-19 pandemic and I was steering well clear of people and enclosed spaces. If - post-pandemic - I do visit the café, I will update this section. I gather it's charming, but I don't know how accessible it is.
"
3868,"I loved doing this! - but realise it isn't something everyone would enjoy.
I didn't require disabled access for my visit, but I'm recording what I saw, as people might not be aware there are some accessible options to do this!"
3869,"Open space for wheelchairs to manoeuvre around the whole building.
"
3870,Good height and although grab rails in place you can have more if you need them. Loads of room to manoeuvre. Plenty of space for a Carer to assist.Although I didn’t need it the shower chair could also be used as a commode.
3871,"There is a step to get into the saloon but with help from my husband and the owner I manage . The staff are always have to assist, I sit in my wheelchair while my hair is cut etc, and there is room for my wheelchair . They just move the chairs they would normally use to one side. I can even stay in my wheelchair when getting my hair washed as the back of my chair folds down, my hairdresser just pushes me over to the sink. "
3872,Excellent all on the level with automated doors.
3873,"Plenty of seating inside and outside bus station and at stances. Induction loop at ticket desk.
No lift as no upper floor.
Generally, decent, friendly staff."
3874,The access is from a very minor ramp and the door is wide enough for me to get my powered wheelchair through. However the door is a pull to open and push to get back out. Which can be a bit tricky. In my experience the customers usually help. However a bell to raise awareness of those neeeding help would be an added benefit.
3875,Basic accessible toilets at the back of the store (next to soft drink aisle). I feel these were poorly signposted and hard to find. No Changing Places.
3876,"Close to Russell Square, a10-15 minute walk from Kings across Station "
3877,All rooms we saw had en suite. Access to the toiled bowl for self catheterisation needed careful negotiation.
3878,"San Marino, west of Rimini in Emilia Romagna is a lovely little Provence of about 30k people, having been to Luxembourg, Lichtenstein and Andorra, it felt very much like they did, having their own individuality and uniqueness. Although we stayed in Rimini, we regretted not having stayed in San Marino. The main castle perched on a cliff top hill with surrounding wooded areas. All the people we met were very friendly and fiercely independent of their own wee home. The stadium where the game was could not have been better, the staff and the local police fantastic. Excellent accessibility and isabled provision, a lift to all areas and good seating. "
3879,The hotel is in a pedestrianised street. I took a taxi from the airport and it took about 20 minutes but was unable to park outside. There is a taxi rank a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. There are buses that stop nearby.
3880,The disabled loo is in the backstage area which was pointed out to us. The toilet was cold and they only had wall bars as opposed to a pull down bar. The toilet was clean with enough room for a medium sized wheelchair. There is not enough room for a carer. 
3881,Disabled loo was accessible - near the reception not far from the bar area. Very clean - nice soap! Slight sill on doorway.  Room wasn't huge but big enough to cope with wheelchair and carer. All the usual griprails. Red cord available.
3882,The toilet was one of the best I have seen.  There was enough room to turn my wheelchair round.  Very clean.
3883,Accessible for wheelchairs. 
3884,Every employee at Yearsley receives disability and equality training.
3885,Access from car park to bar or restaurant not easy.
3886,Sidmouth doesn't have a railway station. The 9 or 9A bus from Exeter takes about 35 - 45 minutes and stops at the Sidmouth Triangle. There are other local bus services that go to Sidmouth. The pub is a couple of minutes from the bus stop.
3887,"From the moment I arrived at the venue, I was guided by friendly staff every step of the way. The music room is via a short lift journey. A member of staff them made the crowd part so that I could be escorted to my wheelchair spot like a VIP.

Located at the front, I was immersed in the show from start to finish!"
3888,"Access is generally good apart from the toilet, there is a public toilet across the street in an emergency accessible via RADAR key. There is a public car park close by, though the slope leading to the car steep and might require some assistance."
3889,"All of the toilets are located in an area on the right hand side as you enter the restaurant there is one accessible toilet. The door opens out wards and is of a good standard with space to move a wheelchair around. 
This is also the baby change area as well"
3890,Lots of parking bays. You can drive right up to the respite lodge.
3891,"Amazing science and discovery venue for the whole family, the staff were really friendly and there are activities for everyone no matter their level of disability. The food is reasonably priced and there is a lot of activities in the 3 hour slot that you are there. There are sensory zones, imagination/role play zones and scientific zone and an outdoor play area (depending on the weather). You are also informed of safety and zone information whilst you are queuing to go in."
3892,The hotel is in the Grassmarket area of the city. It wasn’t too far from the railway station being around ten minutes by taxi.
3893,"There is plenty of parking, the sign for disabled parking sends your right outside the castle, but those spaces are on thick gravel so not easy to wheel through. We stick to the main car park, plenty of spaces. Public transport isn’t great in this area!"
3894,"The staff today were lovely, really helpful and friendly.

We went a few months ago to ask about access and the man on reception was not very helpful and said there wasn't any!?! So glad we took a chance and went back!"
3895,Staff are friendly and helpful.
3896,It's not possible to park as it is a main road. There are frequent accessible buses passing along the street and Charing Cross is a nearby railway station.
3897,"No parking attached to museum , but as very central in the town  did not have far to go to find disabled parking either on street or in local car parks. Very close to the Cheltenham bus station."
3898,"The hotel is on Torquay's sea front. It's about a 8-10 minute, level walk to the railway station. There are also several buses that serve the sea front and the bus stops in both directions are a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. Please note that the buses I used, had one front door which also has a ramp and there were separate wheelchair and buggy  spaces. 

The car parking area in front of the hotel starts on the flat and slopes upwards with a notable gradient. I noted that there is a charge for guests using it. There are disabled bays by the entrance. I didn't have a car so please check with the hotel directly if you require more information about their car park. Please note if you are using a taxi it will stop outside the entrance where there is a ramp to exit the building and the car park is level. "
3899,"All staff were super-friendly and keen to help in any way possible, whilst also being tactfully unintrusive."
3900,We flew into Helsinki airport and the hotel is approx 200yards from the entrance of arrivals well signposted and up a lift/stairs and the hotel is facing you. I am unsure where parking is etc.
3901,Level access.
3902,"The accessible loo is on the ground floor.  One has to negotiate a door from the lobby to reach the toilet and a wheelchair user may need to ask for help.  It is one of these toilets that are for everyone and not just disabled guests, but it is suitable for most disabled persons.  There are grab rails and there is ample space to accommodate a wheelchair as well as a carer."
3903,They have a wheelchair accessible door but don't want to bother opening it. They had to move their tables to get a wheelchair in and complained about the hassle as if it were the wheelchair users fault.
3904,"On street parking  with 1 disabled bay beside restaurant or large free public car park about 500 meters to rear.  Bus stop 100 meters.
We drove."
3905,Permanent ramp to front door. Tables tightly packed in restaurant so can be tricky getting  around once inside/to the disabled loo.
3906,See the review
3907,"Excellent access throughout, from the accessible parking directly at the front of the venue there is level access at the entrance. Lifts get you to the different levels and halls. It has many ramps to enable you to see in the drivers can of some of the steam engines and a ramp that takes you inside one of the carriages of a bullet train. There are a good amount of accessible toilets throughout the different halls."
3908,"rating for parking as do not want to review ourselves.
Coach parking drop of and collect points at Albert docks, very convenient for passengers and our coach has access lift, Large floor level toilet that expands for Wheelchair room also seats with extra leg room and wheelchair spaces to be firmly secured in place, on board games to encourage socialising in large print."
3909,Access is generally very good 
3910,"The staff were all helpful and understanding of disabilities. They went out of their way to make things accessible for me, sometimes taking me on easier routes than were laid out for others. They were often aware that people with disabilities were visiting and were ready to greet and assist.  It would probably be helpful to let them know when you plan to visit. "
3911,No loo. However we left the path at Middleton and visited the Crown (see my other review) which has an exemplary assisted loo as well as great access and food. At Romaldkirk the hotel has a downstairs loo which is not adapted but you can wheel to the door and then walk into the cubicle if you are able - staff very helpful.
3912,All access needs met.
3913,The toilet was large and clean. It had an automatic light when you entered. It had a lever lock that you could operate with a closed fist. The only drawback about the toilet always the flush was on the wrong side.
3914,"There is an accessible loo by the cafe by Victoria Gate. Good size, but maybe a bit narrow if you need help from a carer. Grab rails around loo and sink. Alarm cord. Colour contrasts wasn't great - a lot of white on white."
3915,"This, as many garden centres is very accessible to wheelchair users. But unfortunately since the restaurant/coffee shop have been upgraded access to the counter/food display/tills is inhibiting due to the raised level."
3916,Excellent staff
3917,It's huge!
3918,The closest bus stop is 0.2 miles away. Buses provide disabled access. 
3919,Great! We met at the bar and ate in the Orangerie. It was easy to move tables to accommodate people's seating requirements. The vast majority was level access but where there was a step it was easy to find an alternative route. 
3920,We went to the Tattoo on foot but they do make some provision for Vehicle passes for people sitting in the accessible seating area. If you have one of these you can do a drop off and pick up but this is at least 60 mins before it starts and then you must find a parking space. If you're not driving then there are buses on royal mile but remember its fringe time and some bits are shut off and very busy.
3921,Very helpful. 
3922,"Large loos with grab rails, space for a carer, pull cord alarm. Easy to find. Clean and tidy."
3923,"From the promenade there is step free access. There is a wide open entrance. The pier has wooden planks. Apart from one part where there is a slope/ ramp, see photo, the rest of the pier is level. There are various stalls/ shops selling food and gifts with manual doors. There is plenty of seating. "
3924,"Went by car, which is probably the easiest way to get there; plenty of brown signage from the road running through Stoke. Parking on site though no dedicated disabled person's spaces as far as I could tell."
3925,"I am giving them a star because they do give carer passes… otherwise a bit of a fail (not their fault tho!).  Step up onto the gangplank, fairly substantial flight of stairs either up to the top deck (bar and occasional bands) or down to the middle level, which has a balcony from which you can watch the bands in the main area (actually this is the best view in the venue).  Toilets on the same floor but a tricky set of double doors and step to get in to the gents. No disabled loos.  Main stage and main bar is down another big flight of steps , no loos on that level."
3926,"A good restaurant all on one level. Plenty of space to manoeuvre a mobility scooter. Good staff who are happy to help. I go there weekly for coffee and a cake, but it also serves cooked breakfast and lunches. "
3927,"I am mobility impaired and usually use a wheelchair and so a lot of this report relates to the accessibility aspect of our (my husband and I) two way Atlantic crossing on the QM2.

We checked in about one hour early and that did not cause a problem. Embarkation at Southampton was easy and efficient. We had pre-booked parking and from arrival in our car to getting into our state room took about 40 minutes, the longest queue being security. We were directed to a special check-in area to one side of the terminal with low desks suitable for those in a wheelchair.

Getting from quayside into the ship involves a lift and a bridge similar to that in airports with quite a few difficult to negotiate ramps. Staff (at both ends) on the way out seemed to have been instructed not to help those in a wheelchair manage the ramps and it was annoying to have to struggle to get the chair over the ramps with someone in uniform standing watching from a few feet away.

Our cabin (6108 – not an accessible cabin) was larger than we had imagined. The shower / bathroom had a reasonably low step into it and the shower stool we had requested was already in the shower. We brought with us a couple of suction cup hand rails to affix to the shower walls (purchased on-line for under £10) and these worked very well. 

We stored our folding wheelchair (and our walker) out of the way adjacent to the window – it is an “18 inch” wheelchair and thus too wide to go through the cabin door. We did have the opportunity to see an accessible cabin on the same deck and this had a wide door, a wet room and a lot of floor space although a porthole window (we had a sheltered balcony). We will try to get one of these next time because of the extra space. Our cabin steward lent us a very large rubber floor / door wedge to hold the cabin door open whilst we negotiated entering and leaving– we will bring our own on any future voyages.

There are numerous lifts throughout the ship (A and D are larger than B and C and there are also quite a number of smaller lifts that you have to use to go from Deck 3 to Deck 3 Lower. Most of the ship is disability accessible although some of the doors need holding open and there is one area on the very top to which a wheelchair cannot get. Immediately following any of the lectures, all of the lifts were very busy and it was difficult to get one with sufficient space left for me (in the smaller lifts I took up about half of the lift floor area). We found that the best way to go up was in fact to get in a lift going down and then come up again.

The crew were always willing to offer help with carrying trays, opening doors or patiently standing to one side as we progressed down corridors (unlike some of our impatient fellow passengers who behaved in an insensitive and / or disability blind manner). 

We learnt where the best (marked) spots in the presentation venues were for wheelchairs. You should note that these places in Illuminations are very good but some of those in the Royal Court on the upper level can very poor with a restricted line of sight. It was disappointing that some of our able bodied fellow passengers were unable to read the signs indicating certain seats were reserved for those with mobility issues.

We had no problems eating in the Britannia Court Restaurant, the waiters moved chairs out of the way and ensured I could easily get into a seat and also stored my wheelchair nearby if I chose not to sit in it during the meal. The same positive comments apply to all other eating venues.

We disembarked in Brooklyn for a few hours, the ship arrived on time at 0600 and disembarkation started around 0730. It took us 40 minutes to get from our cabin to outside of the terminal (note that there are few facilities within the terminal and no WIFI – it is really a large shed used for arrivals and departures and other things).

Before arrival in Southampton a note appeared in our State Room saying that we had been registered for wheelchair assistance on arrival – I am not sure if we did something to initiate this but it was very welcome and solved my worry about managing the wheelchair and our luggage out to curb side – it took only 15 minutes from being collected in the QM2 to leaving the car park.

Overall I would say that staff and most of our fellow passengers did practically everything they could to minimise the challenges of caring for a companion in a wheelchair, often without being asked.

In summary, we enjoyed our two way Atlantic crossing and would happily (and intend to) join the QM2 again. One just has to accept the very few negative aspects and enjoy the many positive ones."
3928,"It lost one star because although the neon pink sheep is cool, it is the main barrier to entry as it was placed right in the doorway when I arrived.
The shop does have a lot of stock so there are the issues of navigating around that and it is quite easy to knock stuff over. But I felt it was quite spacious compared to some other gift shops.
The shop is a good size and level access throughout. "
3929,The staff are very friendly.
3930,"Designated disabled parking near to the entrance, wide bays and aisles"
3931,The memorial is easy to access and the museum is right next door. We were staying nearby so it was only a short distance but there are subway stations nearby that are wheelchair accessible.
3932,There is one wheelchair toilet this is to the left as you come up the ramp radar key will open the door outwards good basic toilet but no room for care giver if required could have been cleaner as well
3933,The toilet facilities were fine for our group.
3934,This was my first visit but will definitely visit again. The boardwalks get you right into the marshes and ponds so lots of birds.  Care is needed particularly on the bends and corners but the access here is great for wheels. Not so great for mobility impaired on foot as no benches or handrails.
3935,I had to use my feet which resulted in me being asked to leave.
3936,"I understand in the airport there was ample signage, there were no steps to negotiate, wide access lifts to all floors, departure gates. The special assistance is clearly and very well explained on a very detailed Airport website, it’s important to contact your carrier and the airport as soon as you make your travel arrangements."
3937,"We did not get to use or see the accessible Loo as the lift to that Loo was broken on the day we visited, but the staff were very apologetic and offered us a bedroom to change my son, We were not staying at the Hotel, just visiting for a family Wedding"
3938,"Access to the abbey ruins is via West Gate - see comments and directions above.  The ruins are accessed via undulating grass, which is nice and short.  Inside the ruins it's a mixture of compacted earth and gravel - al manageable by wheelchair. There are a few ramps enabling access to key parts of the ruins. They are a bit severe sometimes and I needed a helping push - however the ramps enabled me to reach most of the ruins. There were grassy slopes to access some other ruined buildings. Only a few sections were inaccessible but hey it's an ancient monument.  We followed the accessible path round the water gardens which had a few slopes - I would advise even motorised wheelchair/scooter users to take a companion to help with the occasional push. Wheelchairs and scooters are available for hire but must be booked in advance. We went in the garden of Lakeside cafe which was level and had some tables with cutaway sections for wheelchair users. We didn't have time to visit all the other buildings eg Fountains Hall. However I visited the display in the Porters Lodge which was fully accessible."
3939,The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.
3940,"If I hadn't been a VIP guest, the parking would have been a big fat zero, and therefore so would the whole review. But instead I had 'VIP Wheelchair Parking', which meant I could use the Blue Badge spaces that have been suspended since before 2012, and in fact made parking a 5-star experience. Granted, dedicated spaces have been freed up in the adjoining Haywards Gallery multistorey carpark, but as we repeatedly tell the management without result, many adapted vehicles - like mine - are too high for it. It was galling to see non-disabled people's lower cars taking up the spaces."
3941,"Toilet with good circulation space, all required rails, good contrast for vision impairment. Lost a star as there is no emergency cord. "
3942,"The site was visited independently of a concert and staff were not in situ at the time. However, the website information regarding disabled access and the dedicated booking line indicate that the venue is extremely welcoming and supportive of disabled concert-goers."
3943,"They have toilets but I didn't use them. However there is an accessible toilet requiring radar key, round the corner from the cafe at the Sidmouth Triangle. "
3944,"The cafe staff at ghe 1st venue were friendly but service was very slow. 
The staff at the pub were very friendly and helpful. "
3945,The staff are friendly and helpful
3946,They were really helpful with doors.
3947,The Brickhouse Farm Cottages are accessible by car and there is ample parking on the site and in particular within close proximity to each cottage. 
3948,At East Grinstead (by the diner static coach) is an accessible toilet that meets building regulations. An additional accessible toilet with high seat is the only toilet on the platform that also serves everyone else. Toilets also signposted in the pub on the Sheffield Park platform.
3949,"All the staff were very helpful. Ensured I was happy with the instructions for using the tramper, without talking down to me."
3950,Helpful
3951,"The was a concrete ramp at the front of the building and a caterpillar track type ramp to the Palm Court Restaurant and another ramp of the same kind to the accessible toilet. The nature of the steps meant that the ramps were quite steep but staff were willing to assist if required. 

Not sure about braille or loop but staff were extremely helpful."
3952,"Outstanding. Friendly, helpful, enthusiastic and very knowledgeable about the food and the wine list. The chef and his team are at the top of their game."
3953,"Self service café in Connaught Gardens open for breakfasts and lunches and some evenings. However, their star attraction are their humongous cakes, delicious, homemade and served in large portions. 
"
3954,Don’t know about parking Asia’s in my wheelchair & others were walking.
3955,"Entry is free to all visitors. A general guidebook and children's guidebook can be purchased from reception. The free audio guide to the galleries that were previously available to visitors will soon be replaced by an app and tablets are currently on order. These will have the audio and visual tour uploaded onto them.  There are also plans to have a BSL tour and audio description tour added to the tablets, which should be ready at the end of June 2017. They will be available from reception. The main entrance is through a level entry, automatic door, which is operated by a push pad on a post to the right of the door and a push button inside to exit. The floor surface is tiled, with a fixed matting area just inside the entrance door. The reception area is well lit with LED spotlights and downlights. Part of the reception desk is lower to make it accessible for wheelchair users. There is an induction loop at the reception desk and another in the Learning Loft. A portable induction loop can be provided by prior arrangement for use during events and tours. A magnifying glass can also be made available if required. MUSA has a small gift shop beside reception on the ground floor.

Bench seating is available in two of the galleries, as well as on the roof terrace and lightweight, portable, folding stools are also provided to take around the museum. These can be picked up from Gallery 1 at the start.
Interpretation in the galleries is in the form of printed text panels and labels and galleries include both manual and digital interactive activities. The four galleries on the ground floor all have level access from reception and between galleries and are extremely spacious. Some of the flooring is tiled, and other areas are wood. There are no doors between galleries. All galleries are lit with a combination of ceiling spotlights and downlights as well as lighting inside display cases. Galleries 2 and 3 have some natural light as well. Gallery 1 has lower light levels due to the sensitive nature of some of the medieval material displayed.

Upstairs, in the Learning Loft there are various interactive activities to try. This area is used for receptions and workshops for schools and can be hired for events by external groups. Group tours can also be provided by prior arrangement.

There is an 8-person lift to the upper floor, with audio announcement and level access to the Learning Loft.  A very slight ramp sits outside the door to the Roof Terrace. Outside the lift next to the toilet, there is a Refuge Point for wheelchair users and those with limited mobility with a door into a corridor leading to stairs. A call system and an Evac chair are available here for evacuation purposes in the event of a fire. All fire exits are clearly signposted and all staff are trained in evacuation procedures.

The Loft floor surface is linoleum in the activity area and carpet in the seating / lecture area. The Learning Loft has a sloped ceiling around the edge of the room, which is lit by dimmable fluorescent lighting. There is also natural light from 3 windows. 
The door to the roof terrace is operated by a push button and it opens inwards. The terrace is level, with a paved surface. It has two fixed benches, without arms. A red light on the terrace indicates that the fire alarm has been activated. On the roof terrace, a ‘Talking Telescope’ describes the spectacular view from the terrace in detail. A specially designed working sun dial accurately tells the time all year round. Wheelchair users can enjoy the stunning views over St Andrews Bay and across to the Eden Estuary and the distant Angus hills thanks to a clear glass panel the corner of the terrace down to floor level. There are items of fixed sculpture on the terrace. 

Assistance dogs are welcome at MUSA and drinking bowls are available on request. Large print versions of all text in temporary exhibitions are available in the gallery. Staff have had training to provide audio description, which can be arranged with prior notice. Printed foreign language guides are also available from reception. 

There is a paved area to the front of the museum with benches. A paved path to the side of the museum leads to a viewing area over the cliffs and out to sea. There is a bench in this area.
"
3956,I am a wheelchair user but can manage to walk very short distances.  The friendly crew asked what assistance I needed to walk up the small ramp which was about 3m then down 2 steps to the back deck of the boat. They kindly carried my wheelchair on board. Sailing under the Forth Bridge then down the river we saw lots of seabirds and some seals.  Inchcolm is not suitable for wheelchair users so we had opted for the cruise only option. Got a really good view of the island and Abbey as the boat goes right round. Nice to go under the new Queensferry Crossing on the way back. We’re going to do the trip again in the summer! Highly recommend.
3957,Staff are more than welcoming and will help with every need. The staff are willing to move furniture around to ease access. They are polite and smiley who would be happy to help you.
3958,"An accessible toilet is available adjacent to the standard toilets. There are two doors to pass through and staff will help with these if required. All the features are at wheelchair height, it was very clean, and wide enough to turn a powerchair."
3959,The staff are very enthusatic and welcoming to all. They provide lots of information upon arrival and explain all activities which will be happening throughout the day which for a small or included price anyone can take part in. Staff are located all over so if require any assistance they are available to help.
3960,Amazing!! Several disabled toilets and not only are they kept immaculate but as well as the pull alarm they all have a skirted alarm all arounf the room; the bottom half tile is actually an easy push alarm for if you fall and can't reach the pull alarm. Nearly cried I was so impressed! They also have a fully fitted changing place with bench and hoist and all adaptations for so many different difficulties. Wish everyone could take our needs into account like that. Would have reviewed earlier but only just found out about this site. 
3961,From Marina access was great. Did not drive or use local transport. 
3962,"An accessible toilet is available on the ground floor adjacent to the shop and cafe. It has a wide door, grab rails, and lowered fittings."
3963,"This beach is a stunning venue all year round. I've visited this beach in both the summer and the winter, and I am always blown away by it. There is a concrete strip alongside the sandy beach, making it accessible for wheelchair users and mobility scooters. The beach itself is extremely clean and well cared for, making it a lovely place to relax."
3964,"First revisit since easing of restrictions , COVID precautions in place. Plenty of outdoor seating available. Staff friendly and helpful. Child friendly, indoor soft play area for younger kids, and fenced outdoor play area for older kids"
3965,"Gerry and Anastasia were very friendly, supportive and patient. Their knowledgeable and safety conscious personalities made everyone feel safe during the climbing wall session while still managing to create a fun and enjoyable atmosphere. The booking for the day was very easy and straightforward thanks to Karens help in client services. All the students only had great things to say about the staff. "
3966,"Disabled toilet is right at the end of the pub by the backdoor leading to the outdoor smoking area. When it is busy it can be difficult to negotiate a wheelchair through the pub to get to this loo. Expect to have to move several people out of your way!
The toilet it's self is adequate. It's not the biggest toilet ever but it complies with legislation and is functional."
3967,None. The restaurant is new in an old building which would take a lot of money to convert and the pavement outside is too narrow for a removable ramp.
3968,"This facility has a fair sized care park which is totally accessible for those in wheelchairs. It is large enough for day visitors and patients cars as well. By a taxi, but they also do have a free service to collect and drop off their patients."
3969,"Access is good, with ramped access, you need to book an accessible rooms as there are floors and sections of floors that only have access via stairs - There are 2 lifts, but they are very small - and a power chair user may struggle - Also the corridor in the room once opened is very narrow (700mm wide) approx"
3970,"I can't say enough about how good the staff are at this venue. They were all super friendly, helpful, attentive and passionate about accessibility. It was great to attend this venue and feel valued from people who genuinely care and want to make accessibility equal for everyone."
3971,"You will be guided to the blue badge bays, in carpark 20, reasonable near enough to the stands. 
Most of the paths are tarmac or block paving, with bench seating in places, and you will find “step free” access around the racecourse.

A dedicated outside area is provided for disabled to view the races, it’s below the main 
stand.

For more details about disabled information, use the “Jockey club, Epsom downs” website.
"
3972,"The toilets are located at the entrance to Monikie Country Park and directly infront of the accessible parking spaces. The male and female toilets are accessed by a step however, there is an accessible toilet that has level access between the male and female toilets. The accessible toilet is very small though and I can imagine it would be quite difficult for a wheelchair user to use, especially if they require assistance from someone else.

Like all toilets is a public park, they weren’t very clean. I mean I felt it was cleaner than others that I have visited. You can see the size of the accessible toilet in an image below showing my wheelchair in it."
3973,"There are two accessible loos, one on the second floor that I didn't visit and one in the basement as you come out of the lift before going through a security door into the music venue. The loo door was okay to open, not too heavy and there was plenty of space to maneuver the chair around. There were grab handles with a drop down one next to the loo. It was reasonably clean, the soap and paper dispensers were full. "
3974,Plenty of disabled bays (8) at the rear of the gallery. Only down side is that the lowered kerb is at the centre of the bay's which is a little frustrating.
3975,There were lifts and ramps if needed
3976,very friendly and helpful
3977,Ramped main entrance with automatic doors straight into reception. Security door to offices is not automatic but receptionist will open the door. 
3978,Can park on the road right out side.
3979,There are a number of disabled parking spaces just outside the restaurant close to the door.
3980,accessible two loos for male and female.  Easy to find. Seemed enough space for a small wheelchair to menouver in the ladies . No red cord. clean.
3981,"Firstly the toileting facility was not solely designed for disabled use, and is unisex.  It has level access and there is grab rails available, transfer on the left is available also however there is not a flush on this side. The emergency pull cord alarm is situated to the left of the toilet however it does not reach the floor. Mirrors available are placed at an angle for better use and the sink is reachable from the toilet. There is no key needed to use this facility."
3982,"The staff are amazing, helpful and friendly and added to the experience!"
3983,"3 Disabled toilets all with grab rails, call cords, large rooms for a carer, one of these is on second floor"
3984,Parking near to the Square is difficult as there aren't many spaces.
3985,Staff were very friendly in both the reception and the gift shop. Advice was offered on how to get around and a map provided.
3986,"Friendly staff, delicious food, cosy venue."
3987,Worth checking The Refúgio dos Burros in Estômbar when open 
3988,"There is a car park near to castle, with very limited disabled bays, but pushing wheelchair around was very difficult."
3989,"There is a small amount of parking for the row of shops right outside, but during busy periods there may not be spaces. There is not a designated disabled parking space. Street parking may be available down the side streets. 

There is a bus stop over the road if using public transport, and it is near to a traffic light to cross the road."
3990,"Very nice, helpful"
3991,There are 2 accessible toilets  fitted with grab rails near the restaurant and bar.
3992,Don't think there was any. 
3993,"The Movenpick Hotel at the Dead Sea ended an amazing holiday for my husband and a group of our friends. We had toured Jordan, for 10 days and stayed at the Movenpick hotels in Petra, Aqaba and finally the Dead Sea. All hotels were fully accessible, with wheelchair accessible rooms. The best was the Dead Sea Hotel. It was a resort style, with several swimming pools . The whole of the site, although it was sloping, was accessible except for the final beach terrace and the access to the Dead Sea itself. A golf buggy did shuttle runs through the site.The dining room had an accessible area right by the buffet and access to an outside terrace. The restaurants through the resort were also accessible. The wheelchair  accessible room was brilliant with stone floors and a bathroom with roll in shower, a wide shower seat and room for a wheelchair and hoist to move around easily. Great staff made us so welcome, nothing was too much trouble for them."
3994,Plenty of parking spaces as this is the city centre.
3995,I went by train into Birmingham Newstreet station Network railway assistants are some of the best for getting me on and off the train. I came out of station and then got tram from right outside station and this takes you straight to Jewelery Quarter and its about two minutes away from station. There are lifts to street level I am sorry do not know about car parking.
3996,A fairly good number of Blue Badge parking spaces and we managed to get parked fine and there was plenty of room to get my wheelchair out of the car and for me to transfer.
3997,Very good but changing places not well advertised.
3998,Walked here from centre of town.
3999,Staff were very helpful. I couldn't get the carers discount from the ticket machine but they gave a refund.
4000,"The door to the bathroom was a sliding door which was great for space and ease of access, the doorway was wide. We had an accessible shower (wet room), there were grab rails and a red cord, the toilet and sink were low and there was a sink bench for putting items on. The sinks had a lever tap and there was a folding shower seat. It was very clean."
4001,We travelled by car. As away supporters our home club could not provide us with a car parking space. I phoned St Johnstone very late (the day before the match) and they made huge efforts to magic a space for us in their fully booked car park. When we arrived later than planned due to traffic the steward recognised that it would be a tricky journey from our allocated space and directed us to a much handier space.
4002,"Even flooring, wide entrance, lots of space inside."
4003,"There was good disabled parking at the hotel, with a number of bays.  Unfortunately it was a wee bit of a walk (I was using a walker on this occasion) but the automatic doors made entry easy."
4004,"Very good!  Carers get in free.  There is a detailed map of the gardens including three levels of access (easy, slight slope, steeper slope or grass paths) so that you can made a judgement based on weather, wheelchair etc.  It includes the location of benches and whether they have a back or not.  The house has a lift to all public floors and all the public areas were accessible to us.  Staff were very friendly and helpful."
4005,"There is one changing places toilet in a modern toilet block, clearly signposted. It's near the Jubilee monorail station and main food hall. It doesn't have a privacy curtain but does include all the usual features and ceiling hoist. A shower is included. There are modern standard wheelchair accessible toilets on the Islands - they should really have had a second CP toilet too as this section could take you 2-3 hours alone if you do the boat as well. I tried two other toilets (Jaguar house (small) and at the end of the Komodo dragons (old/tiny)."
4006,"Really great access, I love the space in this museum. Nothing feels claustrophobic or difficult to move around, crowds are dispersed and centre positioned display cabinets mean there is room all the way round to look inside. A fair amount of glass and shiny surfaces in some parts of the museum however. Lots of lifts and wide open doorways. Entrances are automatic which is great. Good clear map to navigate the building too, and lots of interactive exhibits."
4007,Good access for wheelchairs. 
4008,Fine once you get there
4009,"There are several disabled spaces right next to the entrance, but it's a small gravel carpark so you could park anywhere and be within easy reach of it."
4010,Directly from Babbacombe Downs there is a step free entrance into a patio area where there is free standing tables and chairs and sea views. There is a manual double door to enter the café. One door was unlocked but it was too narrow for me and my crutch so someone had to undo the lock on the other door for me. Into the café there wasn't a step and inside again there were free standing tables and chairs. The café is on the ground floor. The café is waiter service but you may want to go to the counter to look at the cake selection.
4011,"You enter the library at ""Walkway Level"" which is level access all the way from the car park. The front door is powered and uses a push pad. Out of hours you will need a Campus Card to access it. The library can be used by the public - you can get a day pass with photo ID and proof of address, The library is accessed via Campus Card activated barriers, easily wide enough for a wheelchair. Good lighting, both natural and artificial. Good signage. Most corridor doors are on hold opens or powered up , unfortunately a few aren't and they can be heavy. 2 narrow but deep lifts in older part of library access all 6 floors, have mirrors. I small lift in newer part of library with mirror. Computers only accessible by UEA staff and students. Study rooms for individuals or small groups are bookable. Main help desk has high counter. Books and journals stored on shelving that gets quite high. Staff will get you books if you can't reach."
4012,"Tour guide Andrew was very interesting and knowledgable and enthusiastic when asked about the castle.  He took time to answer our questions and brought castle back to life with tales of clan battles. 
Staff went out of their way checking that we were all ok
"
4013,Friendly host 
4014,Fantastic access seating toilets and had a totally independent visit
4015,"We visited Holy Island whilst on holiday and prebooked a visit to the Priory. I used my Mountain Trike because I had seen from photos that the ground is mostly grass, uneven and a little tricky for wheelchairs. My expectations were spot on! I was very glad to have my trike and the visit provided just the right balance between challenge, fun and relaxation."
4016,"Accessible venue including Edwardian villa, well-stocked coffee shop, gardens and events. Sloping site.events."
4017,"Not a strong staff presence around the hotel. Chef on duty was helpful, Bar Staff/ Server not so friendly and brought us the wrong drinks"
4018,"Went out during Pride in my powerchair and found that bar one place, nowhere was accessible. Was just glancing into Poptastic mourning the lost days of my able-bodied youth when one of the bouncers asked if I wanted to come in. I said yes, but those four steps look formidable, and he offered to run round the back and get the ramp! I hadn't had this experience at any other bar we passed and was very surprised. The staff were incredibly helpful and gave me clear directions, and the back door took me straight to the dancefloor! It was easy to get attention when I wanted to leave for the ramp to be put back, too. By far my best experience in Manchester's gay village."
4019,"I think you could get a wheelchair or mobility scooter into the shop, but no help at all for those with other mobility aids "
4020,"I don't drive, so I don't know what the parking is like - but from a quick search, the nearest blue badge spaces are in Nelson Street and Nun Street. There is also good access via the metro; monument is the nearest stop, less than one minute walk away. 

As I have a disabled bus pass, I went with my partner by bus. There is a direct bus that stops on the opposite side of the street directly opposite the cinema. "
4021,Blue Badge holders may park in the Centre's car park if required.
4022,"Staff friendly, helpful and aware of the hearing loops and how they worked."
4023,"The views are phenomenal from up at the Plaza Mirador de San Nicolas viewpoint. You can see the Alhambra and the whole of Granada, and the surrounding mountains. It’s a unique feeling being there, looking down on the City and seeing all the places you’ve visited. I was there around midday and it was fairly quiet. This may be because sunset is the preferred time to go for the position of the sun and the way it lights up the Alhambra. At midday I was looking straight at the sun.

I went up on my mobility scooter from central Granada following the road that the bus takes. It was steep, rough because of the cobbles and hot in the midday sun. I enjoyed seeing lots of this old town area on the way. But, I’ll be getting the bus next time.

While up there, we had a drink at a restaurant on the nearby Plaza de San Nicolas. They brought out a small complementary plate of fried aubergine with honey which was delicious. We moved to another plaza for lunch which was the usual menu of Spanish food and I had the Tortilla which was pretty good. All of these places were accessed only by driving on cobbles. And finding a route without steps was a challenge.

I took the bus back down while my husband took the scenic steps. I had to drive over cobbles to reach the bus stop. "
4024,No offers of assistance.
4025,"The first issue we had was finding a parking space beside the ground. However, we finally found a disabled parking space near the spotty bag shop in Banff. We then had to cross the road and follow this bumpy path until we got to the ground, and I was expecting to be told if I could go around the side of the ground to access (Deveronvale if you're reading this PLEASE let wheelchairs/scooters around the side of the ground) because I had to go through a ""Wheelchair entrance"" which wasn't good. I had to drive through a very tight angle (call me Michael Schumacher) then there was an about 4-inch drop so I needed a strewed to lift me down. When we finally entered the ground and a member of staff greeted us and welcomed us to Princess Royal Park and told us that we could go in a disabled shelter, it had a ramp up to the door of the shelter but there were already 4 people in the shelter so I, unfortunately, couldn't get into the disabled shelter so I can't really comment. We then went around the back of the 'stand' and found a quiet spot with a good view to watch the football match, another thing I would like to comment on is the fact that Princess Royal Park has smooth cement paths all the way around the stadium, perfect for wheelchairs! At halftime, I asked the Steward to show me when the toilet is so I was surprised to find out there was a disabled toilet. When I went into the disabled loo, I was annoyed as there was no red cord but besides that, the toilet was pretty good. At the end of the match, we left by the gate behind the stand."
4026,"We had a brilliant day out the staff could not do enough for us, we took my wheelchair bound grandson who is 7 years old nothing was to much trouble for them, the staff made the day so special for all of us,the disabled toilets are the best  we have ever seen Cadbury world really do care about the disabled ,they made my grandson feel like an every day child NOT a disabled child thank you so much the staff on Saturday you are the best. "
4027,The disabled toilet is in the main Cathedral. The doorway is narrow so it is just big enough to fit a wheelchair in with a carer following in behind. There are handrails throughout the toilets with low-down sinks for convenience.
4028,The British Library is on Euston Road next door next door to St Pancras Station and close to King's Cross and Euston Stations. There are also a number of bus routes that stop outside the library. I travelled on public transport.
4029,"Friendly, helpful and cheerful staff."
4030,"The accessible toilet and shower are great, my only negative would be there there is regularly gym equipment placed in front of it. I've spoken with the gym manager about this and, hopefully, this will no longer happen. Fingers crossed!"
4031,"There are two accessible toilets. At one end of the car park is a RADAR locked toilet, which is very basic and not really maintained now. However, it is often cleaner than the main one.

Next to the cafe is an accessible toilet which is open to all. I think this is also the baby changing facility. It is currently used by all, due to Covid restrictions, and is therefore busy and often not as clean as it should be. Due to the nature of the park attracting many young people, we have often found groups of teenies playing in the toilet and had to wait ages for them to come out."
4032,"Riverside car park is huge. There are some accessible spaces but they weren't as obvious as they could be. There are no markings on the floor, just little signs on the fences. The accessible spaces are at the end nearest the Cavendish Pavillion."
4033,"During our visit, the other toilets were out of use, so all customers were using the single accessible toilet. It wasn't that clean, which may be due to it getting used by more people than usual!

The toilet had a radar key lock, but this wasn't getting used. The emergency cord was wrapped round a support handle (. . but now untied and sporting a new Euans Guide card!!)

If you need a carer, it would likely be a bit of a tight squeeze if you also had a wheelchair in there.

The toilet is also the baby changing facility."
4034,"Good size toilets with left transfer, hand dryer would be better as well as as a bigger lock indoors for those with difficulties."
4035,"We parked in the normal carpark. There is access  via a dirt road for cars, to the start of the Boardwalk."
4036,Access was through box office step free. Staff were attentive opened doors till you got to destination.
4037,"Disabled toilet at front door. Door could benefit from wheelchair sign, but clean and accessible."
4038,"Drove, parked each time using blue badge on George Street."
4039,"A small, quiet, stunning, boutique style hotel in Corfu Town centre. The hotel is accessible to some people with mobility disabilities. The hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful. It was pleasure to stay here. Loved it, loved it, loved it."
4040,"Staff made little or no effort to advise when we bought our ticket - they could have saved us a lot of trouble at the site! The route from car park to fort is via a 1:4 gravel path and a gate which whilst wide enough for a wheelchair is set at a right angle making it very difficult for a chair to negotiate - admittedly there's a driving route for disabled visitors that bypasses this but we thought we would enjoy the walk (our first mistake as the gravel gives no traction!). Access to the fort itself is diabolical - via a steep grassy, uneven slope. In the photos, that's the slope behind the sign for the museum - you can see the access gate at the top. Once in the fort you need to take care as the site slopes quite a bit in places. The grassy surface is occasionally bumpy and uneven. There's a museum by the fort. This by contrast has good access. There's an excellent film show. "
4041,"The toilets can be hard to access as even though it clearly says ""disabled toilets"" on the door, everyone else uses the toilet. I needed the toilet but there was a LONG queue of about 20 people and not one of them was physically disabled and it took me 20 minutes to get to the front of the queue.  "
4042,"Superb signposting throughout (inc maps).
Open plan layout means no pesky doors to negotiate (except the front automatic ones)
If entering by ASDA there is a lift to the main shopping floor but otherwise all is level access."
4043,"A nice place to visit for a few hours,worth the drive.A shop and places to eat are on site all fully accessible to have a picture taken with the famous Lands End signpost is £10 though !! "
4044,"This is my favourite pub in Edinburgh. I used to visit it a lot more frequently when I worked in Edinburgh, but now when visiting the city I always try to pop in if I can. It is a great pub if you are into rock and metal music and is usually a frequent hang out spot for before and after metal gigs taking place in either Edinburgh or Glasgow. The entrance to the pub is however on a stoned staircase so I’m not sure if they have a portable ramp to make it wheelchair accessible. "
4045,There were a few of them with parking spaces near the main building and accommodation.
4046,Five stars for the bar staff who served us an interacted with us. One star for the managers who have allowed the dangerous and incompetent accessible toilet arrangements.
4047,All the loos are accessible some with more room than others but I found them all quite easy to use.  All had sufficient room to manoeuvre a self propelled wheel chair and there were.sufficient grab rails
4048,"There is no dedicated parking for Argos but there is parking at Intu with large accessible bays (not free) and limited street parking (free if have a blue badge).

There is a bus stop but it depends where you are coming from. 

Nearest bus station is Derby Bus Station which is about 8 minutes away. Nearest railway station is around 12 minutes away. "
4049,Wheel chair access and the over all exspernce was amazing
4050,"Historic house, which was the former Governors' House which was reputedly Christopher Columbus visited. The house has been transformed into a museum about the his voyages and the ""discovery"" of America. "
4051,"Good lift, lovely staff to meet and greet and show you to your seat. Huge area. We had the best seats in the house."
4052,"Near the playground accessible toilets, have to find a park staff to use it."
4053,There is a couple of disabled parking spaces outside and some larger spaces at the side of the building.
4054,"Parking was available in Blue Badge spaces not far from the entrance and there's a bus stop, albeit up a ramp, outside the north entrance."
4055,"Staff were very nice, great fun. Good for accessibility"
4056,"No parking close by, in the very heart of the city"
4057,There is a ramp for accessing the venue which is good. 4 because of the gate access and also the wheelchair point re toilet doors.
4058,Great staff who moved things for me to move.
4059,Great restaurant but not great access. Can get in side door with two steps. Staff will help. I use a wheelchair and get access through fire door with help.
4060,Staff took our access complaints seriously and did their best to make what immediate adjustments they could.
4061,"The staff are good they have got a Autism freindly award what is good, Ibrox staff  were very helpful"
4062,There is a ramp. There is a buzzer to get someone to open door. There is no braille label. The doors are automatic openers but require a button to open. There is a hearing loop system in place.
4063,"Some great, some terrible.  Any time we asked a question at a ride we were always referred to guest services - we could have spent our whole day just at guest services!
One staff refused to open the disabled entrance for us onto a ride. 
Staff could do with training around people with learning disabilities and/or autism as well as correct ways how to handle challenging behaviours and not just pushing people back (scene we witnessed with a young person who was there with their dad)"
4064,Some steps but staff ready with ramps and help in pushing chair. Parts of garden difficult to push chair on.
4065,"Toilets are very spacious with lots of room to move around. The toilets have hoists, showers and  adult changing benches. At the moment the centre is awaiting height adjustable changing benches to be classified as changing places toilets."
4066,"Great accessible toilet, just near the entrance. Fairly spacious and red cord hung correctly!"
4067,"Staff were really friendly, helpful, and accommodating."
4068,"The location was excellent, just a few meters from a long promenade which had numerous shops, bars and restaurant.  A taxi rank was only about 15  meters away and bus stops within easy walking distance."
4069,From Car Park to House on flat ground.
4070,"Disabled loo is fine,  with rails , but of tight squeeze for a carer."
4071,Very helpful and friendly staff.
4072,"Accessible loos in visitor centre and at entrance to country park. Possibly at other points too but I didn't see them.  One in visitor centre was spacious, well equipped, clean.
Apparently the country park one is radar key entry (the visitor centre one is not)."
4073,"Accessible parking isn't signposted until you actually arrive at it, but we know where it is, so we were fine. There are plenty of spaces and it is clean and open, with level access through automatic doors into the centre. There are pebbled areas around the parking which are great for toileting my assistance dog before going in."
4074,Nice and clean. When I went in they were with the radar keys that they were not abused by the general public
4075,Bluewater is a great place for disabled access and shopping.
4076,"Wheelchair access is fantastic. I could access every shop I went in to in my powerchair & was able to get on to every level using one of the two lifts I saw (I don't know if there are any more) the lifts although not massive, were big enough for me in my powerchair + 1 friend, but could easily have got another one or two people in the lift with us."
4077,open spaces make it very accessible all way round
4078,"The pebbly car park meant we could not have accessed the terrace from that direction but entering the hotel through the front door was fine and you could then access the restaurant and the rooms with no problem. There was further parking on a tarmac surface. The tables in the restaurant were too small to accommodate my power chair but one of the staff drew our attention to a circular table nearby which I was able to use without having to transfer to a dining chair. We asked if we could reserve it for the following evening as well and they put a reserved notice on it for breakfast as well. This continued even when there had been a changeover of staff so we were really pleased with their awareness.
They have a spa but this would have meant negotiating the pebbly car park so I probably wouldn't have used it even if I had wanted to."
4079,"Very good sized loo, able to turn my large outdoor power chair with ease. "
4080,"The walled garden is ok for wheelchair users, and some of the other paths. The courtyear is dreadful - very thick gravel that is near impossible to push through. The tea room and toilets are through the gravel so not good. There is a ramp into the gift shop but it is very steep and short. Unsure if there was a disabled toilet - I did look but I don’t think there was. "
4081,The exhibition is towards the Joppa end of the prom. There are several buses which stop on the High Street so if you're travelling here by bus it's probably easiest to get off there. If you're parking there are accessible bays next to the swimming pool. There is free parking on the streets leading up to the prom but it does get busy - especially at weekends.
4082,"It’s often so difficult to go to the cinema when you are disabled as you end up in the front of the cinema and end up with a nasty crick in your neck.
This was not true at the DCA. I went with some friends to the cinema today and they could not work out how you prebooked the wheelchair seats. (Having looked since it’s not actually hard you just have to email or Phone  and ask). When we got there the staff were really helpful and said we could chose whether to sit up in the wheelchair seats or if we preferred we could sit in our booked seats and it’s fully ramped to the front at the right hand sided. We chose to sit in our booked seats as it is currently quiet with the Covid spacing of seats so we knew we wouldn’t be stopping anyone getting to their seats further in the row. Maybe not an option if it was busy or if you struggle to transfer but worked for us and the seats were really comfy. The staff were all really helpful and nice to be able to sit in the cinema seats as there was ramped access."
4083,System of easy accessible ramps on each side of the building leading to the doors which If I was picky - could do with being automatic doors.
4084,"The accessible loo is in the bar, which is fine when it is quiet, but difficult to get to when it's busy, and other members of the public are using it! As accessible looks go it is roomy, but I've seen cleaner loos!"
4085,We wandered in from the Mall and easy to find. Not sure about parking nearby.
4086,"Lots of toilets throughout centre, well sign posted.
Less accessible toilets but all are spacious."
4087,"All where very friendly and helpful, we were escorted  around the hotel by a very pleasant lady, Hannah Elver, of the hotels management who tried her best to advice us about the hotel, and the gentleman on reception was more than kind, and he too escorted my husband around the grounds by willingly pushing his chair for him, what more could we ask.
All the staff were also excellent, and saw to our every need."
4088,There are only two disabled toilets for the whole building (plus one in the learning centre). These are both on the ground floor and we'll sign posted. Both toilets are large with non touch flush and automatic tap. Dryer and hand towel available. Not too clean so only 3 stars. No disabled toilets by main restaurant or gallery cafe.
4089,"There was a council car park at the entrance to Norie Miller Park however, it was cornered off for the event. Therefore, we parked about a 5-minute walk away in a council car park. Around Perth there are a few council car parks near Norie Miller Park.

Within at least a 10-minute distance from the park there is a bus station and train station. I'm not sure about the local public transport because I am not from this area."
4090,"Visited for our holiday during the week 23 - 30th July 2016. Loved it. Travelled with my elderly parents, partner and 2 children. My dad is a non step taking stroke victim who relies completely on a power wheelchair. The cottage is just wonderful, what I loved was the accommodation being over the 2 floors, with the disabled access bedroom and bathroom located on the ground floor and further living accommodation being on the first floor.  My dad made great use of the electric bed, which made putting him to bed easier, all entrances are level and doors are wider leaving plenty of room to get him around. I think Jane and Richard care about what service they are providing as a family, nothing was too much trouble and the finishing touches and attention to detail are lovely. It didn't feel like a disabled venue, the finishing was done to a  high level, beautiful kitchen and bathrooms, particularly the ground floor accessible bathroom. Gorgeous garden too, Highly recommended"
4091,"My Mum and I went to Costco to get some shopping. We walked in, Mum showed her card and the man on the door said that I couldn’t come in without a Face Mask. We explained that I was exempt from wearing a face mask and so Mum then helped me to get back to the car and went shopping on her own"
4092,"The Waterside is part of Simsins chain which has restaurants located across Ayrshire. The Waterside is located in Seamil near West Kilbride. The restaurant has recently had hotel accommodation added to cater for wedding parties. I have not used the accommodation so can’t comment on its accessibility.

I do enjoy visiting the restaurant for meals and drinks with friends and family."
4093,"The staff were very helpful and chatted with my daughter, which was nice. We only intended going in for a hot chocolate while we waited for the store next door to open, but ended up having lunch too as we felt so welcome."
4094,"Clearly signposted at Royal circle level but through heavy double doors again and somewhat grubby. No hand drier just paper towel dispenser so tightly packed I couldn't work it. Red cord tied out of reach.  Found a further disabled loo just inside door leading to front stalls, this one is not signposted from the bar/foyer area - it ought to be!"
4095,"All along the promenade is level and there is a cafe which is also level and serves good coffee. The pier is all level and the funicular railway is wheelchair friendly. Heartily recommend the Seaview Restaurant which has seating downstairs and a lift takes you up to the upstairs, which has accessible seating inside or - highly recommended - outside on the terrace with amazing views. The fish and chips there are absolutely excellent!"
4096,None in the Chapel when we visited. Whoever bolted the accessible door gets 1 star. The helpful staff member in the King's Centre deserves five stars.
4097,At least for blue badge base with extra space around them
4098,"The Lego Store in London's Leicester Square.

The entrance is based on a train station design, complete with large Lego train you can sit in, a Lego London tube map on the wall, and Lego London landmarks.

Over two floors, there is plenty of Lego of all types which would keep fans occupied. However, even if not a fan, pop in when passing and see it."
4099,some parking behind but unsure whether our mobility vehicle would fit under arch.  Disabled spaces available in nearby village CP (free)  300yds.
4100,Parking bays outside main entrance. Car park level with good surface.  Not a huge number of disabled bays but plenty of other spaces. Not sure about buses but assume car needed to get here due to location.
4101,"The Skippers and crew are all very friendly and supportive, have a sound knowledge  of the History of STC and the canals and are very hospitable"
4102,"Plenty of parking spaces for blue badge holders which are near to the store and on an even-ish level.
If need be you can park in the parent and child spaces if you have a blue badge.
There is some misuse of blue badge parking spaces which can't be enforced but we've always managed to find somewhere near to the store to park either in the blue badge spaces or parent and child spaces.
The car park is on a bit of an uneven level so if can be tricky to push yourself in a manual wheelchair, esp if you don't have great upper body strength.
There is a slight slope into the store's entrance that I personally need a hand with if I hit it an an awkward angle but my carers or a helpful passer by is always at hand."
4103,Very helpful
4104,Ramped access into the visitors centre toilets and cafe
4105,There is tactile pavement markers on path. If walking there is a heavy metal gate. The doors open automatically. Reception desk had a lowered section for writing on but no lowered serving section that I could see. Lights were bright and there wasn't any music. The building is huge with lots of facilities I haven't accessed. The shop had enough space for a chair to get between the aisles. 
4106,"This is an outdoor shopping outlet. A few mins off Junction 32 of the M62. Good public transport. Easy to get around if disabled and good facilities. Good mix of shops from Next, Cadbury to Hallmark and Gap. Small selection of food outlets but are more across the road at Xscape."
4107,"What really aided access here was the spaciousness, lack of big crowds and the gently sloping astro-turfed ramps. It is a very relaxed environment, with headphones given to audience members who wish to watch the big screen comedy. This keeps it quieter, and there are less clashing noises all happening at once. At most you will have the chatter from people enjoying drinks or music from a band should there be one. 

The open space is great! And the transparent roof shelter really helps to keep it bright and roomy. I think a greater choice of seating could improve this space, as it was mainly bean bags for kids, picnic tables or very low to the ground deck chairs. A few more separate tables and chairs would be helpful. "
4108,"You can get accessible public transport that stops close to here. A lot more on Rome's buses are now accessible. There are parking areas close to here, but I'm not sure how many are disabled parking bays."
4109,Really helpful and inclusive. Non judgemental of neurodiverse behaviour. Table service - system of raising a sign on the table to gain their attention was really smooth to use. Quick to get service. Informative staff. Friendly and welcoming. 
4110,"There are grab rails in one of three cubicles, with very narrow entrances to the toilet on both floors making it very difficult to fit a Wheelchair through. There would be no room for a carer to assist in the cubicles."
4111,One of the buildings of the School of Health Sciences. A half mile from main campus so the in house cafe is appreciated. Generally good access.
4112,Staff were very happy to help.
4113,Staff were all extremely helpful and pleasant throughout our stay.
4114,You couldn't do much better without upgrading to a Changing Places format
4115,"No parking outside restaurant, but plenty of blue badge spaces within 300m walk."
4116,The staff are very friendly and helpful
4117,"Wheelchair accessibility to the majority of areas of the castle and gardens is good.  Ramps and toilets are well signposted, areas of the grounds and gardens are also well signposted.  A visitor map is given out with the tickets allowing an overview of the setting, castle tour times are displayed by the entrance.  The castle tour is conducted with anecdotal evidence that is easy to listen to and encouragement is given to handling objects for visitors with visual impairment.  There are a number of benches positioned around the terrace, grounds and walled gardens for visitors to enjoy the setting."
4118,"The staff were ok when we arrived, but when I was told that I was not allowed to take my electric chair to the gate my I was very unhappy. When they brought the airport chair the staff member who pushed  me around was amazing. He told me everything that he was doing and was very friendly and funny."
4119,"Went for dinner with my PA Beca. This place is easy access, spacious, disability aware and just the best food! Reasonably priced delicious and freshly made food. Chilled atmosphere and good music played. They make you feel like family when you visit. Bartenders very knowledgeable on drinks. Dog friendly. I feel very at ease here despite scooting about in my power chair. If you need help, they are more than happy to help. Scott the manager is a 6’5 covered in tattoos GEM of a guy!! When you go, tell them Kim sent you!! What makes it special to me is that I am treated like family and NOTHING about my disability is an issue. They see me, not the chair. 
There is usually parking just across the road but can get busy on a Sunday. It’s open Fri to Sun 12pm TIL late. "
4120,"After arriving along a lovely driveway, we reached the designated disabled parking area, with 9 bays available, all very close to the main entrance and from here on it’s all on the level."
4121,It was very apparent the organisers had thought about being inclusive and providing good access.
4122,"reasonably sized disabled toilet, well appointed but through a heavy fire door"
4123,"Public transport isn't too great around this area of Falkirk, although I did see a bus stop in the car park. It did have a sign saying that buses don't depart from there however, do it does appear to just be a drop off point which might leave some people stranded...The car parking however is great. There are lots of accessible spaces nearby, although it can get quite busy in summer months. You can also access this cafe via the wide canal walkways!"
4124,could have been bigger - no changing bench of any type and was difficult to do a 360 degree turn.
4125,"Great access in the areas we covered! Lots of space in the cafe with signs for wheelchair access at the food service point. Smooth floors and lots of room between tables and chairs - any other cafe might have squeezed dozens more tables and chairs in here, but IKEA did not and it is so much better for it! I could only see one lift, however there may be more that I'm not aware of. The lift isn't huge but still roomy."
4126,"I would say the accessible toilet is the best thing at this Starbucks. It is very spacious, clean and the emergency red cord was hanging freely. Although you can only really transfer on to the toilet at the right-hand side because it is nearer the wall at the other side. The only thing would be is that the doors were quite heavy to open, there was a toilet to get into the main toilet area and then a door to get into the accessible toilet.

I’m not sure where the closest Changing Place toilet is. "
4127,Staff were very welcoming and helpful throughout. The person checking the tickets also directed everyone to their seat.
4128,"Ramped access which might be a bit tight for those using electric wheelchairs. Manual doors at entrance but usually plenty of staff/fellow customers on hand ready to assist. Access to coffee shop slightly hampered by child's ridealong but not too bad. Again, manual doors into the coffee shop."
4129,"We went by car. Parking was near the entrance on grass.  You can drop of in front on a hard, flat surface."
4130,Easily accessible from Edinburgh city centre 
4131,Immediate area is under construction at the moment so not sure how parking would work.
4132,"The toilets are located on the bottom level which is accessible by stairs and lift. I loved how clean the accessible toilet was. The toilet has a fold-down grab bar on the right-side and the toilet roll holder was within easy reach. I l also loved the large roll-under sink because it was a good size and height. The only downside was the space within the bathroom. Once the door is closed it can be difficult to move your wheelchair around, especially if you have someone in helping you.  "
4133,"Large, clean and fresh disabled toilet with grab rails and emergency alarm cord.  "
4134,We were dropped off outside as limited parking on the street. Close to city centre for busses. About a 10 min walk from the train station.
4135,"Loads of stalls selling crepes, hotdogs, gluhwein, gifts and rides and games. Located on the many levels of Princes Street Gardens. Smooth wide paths, good signage and well lit. Take plenty of cash (not credit cards) and a good appetite."
4136,"There is limited disabled parking, but the staff will reserve you a space if you ask"
4137,"There's a flat tarred parking area at the accessible parking, the rest of the car park is gravel. There is a ramp to the door. This is a modern build so has wide doors and is fully accessible throughout with plent space between tables. There is an outdoor decked area for sitting when the weather is fine "
4138,It's fst casual dining so the staff are very attentative to make sure you eat in good time with limited waiting. Food comes at different times but it all arrives less than ten minutes after ordering
4139,The entrance to the stand is level and there is a separate access for wheelchair users so there is less chance of getting caught up in the crowd. The entrance for wheelchairs is not very well sign posted but the stewards and police were very helpful.
4140,"Most of Ile de Re is flat and is popular with cyclists. Likewise much of Saint Martin de Re is also flat. The area round the harbour side is flat. The harbour is quite large and without distractions, will take about 15 minutes to walk the entire length. The area round the port is mainly pedestrianised as few vehicles use the road round the port. The road surface is large, quite flat and smooth cobblestone and the pavements are smooth limestone. Throughout the harbour there are benches to sit on. Surrounding the harbour are cafés and restaurants, all of which have some outdoor seating. The port area is very much a place where people relax and people watch.
 La Martiniere, which is an ice cream stall on the harbour front. The stall is directly onto the pavement, so is step free, but the counter is at standing height. There is an impressive selection of ice creams in an amazing variety of flavours, which can be served in a cone or tub. The stall has no seating area, but there are benches nearby. 
I also ate at La Sarrasine, which is a creperie, serving sweet crepes and  savoury galettes, omelettes and impressive ice cream sundaes. The restaurant had outdoor and indoor seating, all with moveable chairs and tables.
Hotel Les Colonnes has a restaurant which serves a variety of food including crepes and galetttes. I ate outside when I went here so I can't comment on the indoor area.
Le Marco Polo, is a pizza and creperie at the opposite end of the port from the bus stop. Although I ate outside I used their toilets and noticed that here were a couple of ramps so step free to the toilet.
Le Phare  is a pizzeria and again I ate outside, but there was also indoor seating.
Cafe De La Paix has a general tourist type menu, with seating inside and out, again I ate outside.
There are a number of  small shops, some very exclusive clothes shops, with more tourist type shops in the little streets leading off from the port area. The some of the shopping streets are on an incline. These streets are also pedestrianised.  The shops sell a range of things from clothing, bags, to more specialist produce of the area, sea salt, salted caramels, soaps, etc. The shops tend to be small and filled with produce and some maybe easier to go into than others. Continuing up the incline you reach the old town with limestone and timber framed houses with shutters and the church of Saint Martin de Re, which had stepped entrance but I think a 2nd entrance is more accessible. The church is nice but nothing special. It has a tower, lots of stairs to a viewing point, which I didn't see.
On the bus stop side of the port is a park, with grass area, with a light house, some of the fortifications, there's flat bits and slopey bits, so need care to navigate, but some of it was doable. It's a nice area, there are some benches and was quite quiet when I visited. In the school summer holidays the donkeys with trousers offer rides to children. 
One day I had about a 30 minute level walk to one of the entrance gates of the fortifications, via Cours Vauban with a couple of benches to rest on the way, and next to the gate was a field with some of the local donkeys that have shaggy coats, they were not wearing their trousers. There were a couple of benches and it was very pleasant just sitting watching the donkeys and having a rest after the walk.
Also in the port area opposite the bus stop is a tourist information office, the lady in there was very helpful advising me, in English, about where I could visit easily on public transport. Also by the bus stop is Musee Ernest Cognacq, the step free, local history museum which I have written a separate Euan's Guide review for as well as the hotel I stayed in."
4141,"Always have walked here, though I didn't see any parking spaces near by, I am pretty sure that cars and taxis will be able to drive up to the front entrance and drop people off. It's just off the high street so not too far away from public transport either. "
4142,Friendly staff and wheelchair accessible throughout. 
4143,"The room was a great size, especially for a wheelchair user. Adequate hand rails in bathroom and shower seat. I found the bed was very low, so difficult to transfer in and out of wheelchair. Very uncomfortable bed for me too. "
4144,"Over the years I have visited many visitor and leisure attractions and been challenged by the accessibility for me as powerchair user. Never before have I and my friends been made as welcome as we were on this visit. Excitedly, I met other disabled people who were visiting who felt the same ..."
4145,"Large car park near the door, my small scooter got over the slight roughness easily."
4146,Disabled access can be found at the rear of the restaurant.
4147,"Fantastic. I have been in 3 or 4 times now and everytime I come in the staff help me with the door, carry my food and drink to my table and are happy to read out the menu in great detail. "
4148,"Didn't meet any staff, but did phone the owner to arrange earlier access.  This was dealt with to the letter, with excellent email communications"
4149,all on the  flat outside the museum and inside theres lifts to get upstairs.  everything is on eye level 
4150,I am a powered wheelchair user with poor speech. A disabled friend recommended the Magpie. They accepted my booking by email which avoids the inevitable queues. Our party of 10 all enjoyed our meals chosen from an extensive menu. The staff were friendly and helpful to me in particular.  The toilets are located on the top floor which is accessible for my wheelchair in the lift.
4151,See above
4152,"Lots of buses go past, Knightsbridge Underground Station is close by (though I don't know if that has lifts or not). I don't know about parking"
4153,"We suggest the main Touchwood car park, but a little costly, minimum of £2.50, or  have a cup of coffee at the Crowne Plaza, REGISTERING YOUR CAR AT RECEPTION DESK, and walk across through the gardens to Touchwood shops. Mind you, it is hard work for your carer this way, it’s uphill, round and round gardens with a huff and a puff on the way, but it’s cost free, well, not really because you have had to enjoy a decent cup of coffee at the hotel."
4154,Wheelchair accessible restaurant with more tables upstairs and very friendly staff. Serves a delicious brunch 7 days a week until 4pm with a DJ playing great tunes
4155,"What a delightful way to spend a couple of hours learning about Edinburgh's rich history. Our tour guide Laura was very knowledgeable and had researched a route the day before to ensure that everything she had planned was suitable for all our different abilities. I was really touched by this. As we wandered, we learned about Edinburgh's unicorn, the origins of an amazing fire service, the Scottish Enlightenment and why we got the nickname Auld Reekie. The tour was fun and full of knowledge."
4156,"There is ample parking around the Royal Mile, parked on Chambers Street next to the museum however this might not be practical if you have difficulty walking."
4157,"transport to and from the centre takes too long centre out in the middle of nowhere it was the old maternity hospital.
easily accessible once you get there
pleasant staff welcoming atmosphere
"
4158,"I went here with two friends, the food was of a good standard and the price is reasonable for any budget. The decor is as Thai as it could possibly be  and the staff are friendly. The service is super quick and all in all the quality of food and service does not take away from this rating. 

However the problem is access, the venue is small, so it would be difficult for a wheelchair to get around, the table that we were sat in was quite cramped and would be difficult for a wheelchair to get close, however there was other tables around.  Unfortunately they did not have a disabled toilet, and the toilet they did have was blocked by food stuffs which made it difficult to get into with walking aids. There was little background noise and no bright lighting. 

"
4159,Accessible toilet with ample room and grab rails. Was shared with baby changing facilities. It was clean and tidy.
4160,Not the cleanest but enough room
4161,Large car park with no disabled bay but club has sign for you car and don’t have to pay. If you find an end Bay you can use as no upstands in the way.
4162,"Large space for parking several vehicles. Bus stop 10 minutes walk , no pavement and along a narrow country lane. Not much passing traffic. Bus service was reliable and a good service to surrounding areas. "
4163,All the toilets are accesible
4164,"Bus stop was outside Burton Train Station, about 10 minutes walk away. There were disabled bays outside but they were only basic, no markings to make sure people don't park too close. "
4165,Cannot fault Maria in the restaurant she reserves tables so there are always some avail for disabled people
4166,"Two disabled bays reasonable close to main entrance, which had a small step over curb and by door, but easily managed. Once inside hotel, everything on ground floor level was nice and flat, space to get wheelchair around comfortably, with room in bar area and restaurant for chair.
The disabled bedroon is down on the lower floor, with a 
wheelchair lift right by reception desk, then a pull door to get you into corridor to reach your room.
The lovely terrace area has a ramp for you to go and enjoy the sunny warm day, with views over the well looked after grounds, but no ramp to get you down to enjoy the walk across to pool and woodland area."
4167,Access is through 2 automatic doors and to get up to the 2nd floor you have to use a lift.
4168,Very friendly and helpful.  If you were staying here I am sure they would go out of their way to be helpful.
4169,A number of Disabled bay at the Main Entrance and main entrance and a number to the side entrance . 
4170,No steps to first 8/9 tables by doorway. Been four times - never been unable to find one of those tables.
4171,There is no parking available but as it is situated on Waverley Bridge it easy to access from any bus going to Princes Street or train going to Waverley.
4172,Accessible toilet is on floor 1 and opened by a RADAR KEY. Staff members are very helpful and more than happy to help with opening doors when you ask for a key. The loo has handrails on each side and a red cord that touches the floor. 
4173,"Some doorways tricky for a broad wheelchair, but basically excellent."
4174,"We drove to each of the 3 stops....... car parks were easy to find, large with  sufficient disabled bays."
4175,"Blackpool centre is a nightmare to park,  The council has removed some disabled parking and relocated others but they go quickly.  If you are lucky you can get a spot outside."
4176,Very helpful staff didn't really require them to do much except show us to our table and take our order but it was done with politeness.No complaints at all.
4177,"The shop has a step-free entrance and is generally easily navigable for wheelchair users, except for certain very tight spots between display stands/racks, where I couldn't get through. This could be improved with a less crammed layout. 

There is a lift to all floors. The lift is good. But when you exit the lift on the 1st floor, you are confronted with a clothes rack right in front of the lift doors, and it was a difficult and tight squeeze to get past it. And then the same clothes rack was blocking access to the display stand on the other side. Clearly the clothes rack shouldn't be there at all. When I asked staff to move it for me, they promptly did, but annoyingly they thought it was FUNNY that it was blocking my access, and they tittered. This is not acceptable behaviour - Uniqlo should be training staff to take accessibility seriously, and at this branch at least it has failed to do so. Not impressed. "
4178,"The centre has wheelchair friendly ramps, lifts and automatic doors, as well as braille readers and large print guides."
4179,"The site is pretty much flat on all one level with wide paths and gentle slopes.

The pod that we stayed in was not accessible as it had a step up to it and a large 15cm lib at the entrance door."
4180,Disabled on street parking at door to Kelvin Hall   On major bus routes and Underground close by at Partick Cross
4181,"A very fancy place to go for drinks, snacks, afternoon tea, or dinner. Would recommend dressing up a bit if you're going, because it feels very grand! 
Definitely an experience; good food, friendly staff, and gorgeous building. 

Also has step free access and accessible toilet. So we're happy! Only got marked down half a star because of heavy doors to get in that aren't automatic. "
4182,Only marked down as all disabled parking taken. Trouble getting wheelchair out car.
4183,There is a regular toilet but it is down a twisty set of stairs with a handrail. This is also the stairs the waiting staff use.
4184,"Just two miles out of Stratford apon Avon, large car park without any disabled bays, with a flat ride up to a long ramp leading into restaurant."
4185,I didn't use them but my friend did
4186,"This place is huge, the upper bit is only accessible by steps, which a ramp could had easily been put instead. But the lower section is big and is accessible with an accessible loo. "
4187,Getting to the Winter Gardens for us was a short wheel from the railway station. Several folk were arriving by taxi and being dropped off at the door. The other option may be to walk up from the tram stop or the nearby bus stops.
4188,"I regularly visit this cinema and the staff are always very friendly and attentive. There is a ramped kerb from the car park and it is level access into the foyer. Inside the cinema there are separate disabled toilets, ramps in addition to steps and allocated spaces for wheelchair users in the theatre itself. "
4189,No disabled parking but City Centre location so parking available in City Car Parks and public transport nearby.
4190,There's a good accessible loo. It may be a little tight for some powerchair users. It is kept locked but the key is available from the staff.
4191,Didn't use coz it was being used by a child so struggled in to ladies which was fine. 
4192,"On entrance to the shopping centre there is two moving staircase escalators which are wheelchair friendly. There is also a lift to the first and second floor of the shopping centre. There are maps dotted around the shopping centre and plenty of seats around the shops. 

 "
4193,"As the the restaurant is on the edge of Westfield Shopping centre, there's no parking other than that for the centre.  Buses don't stop right outside but obviously stop at Westfield."
4194,They have a ramp for those who are in a wheelchair but for getting into the theatre there isn't an accessibility point to get in as far as I had seen.
4195,"Plenty of room in the wetroom, inc for a hoist."
4196,Car park is public and to the rear or there is street parking.  Bus stop on both sides of the road and directly in front of the restaurant.
4197,"The parking is on level ground, sometimes on grassland, and both have easy enough paths to allow you to be pushed along by your Carer. It’s only the gardens you can view, but worth your effort."
4198,"Ground level access from parking to walking right into the inflatables. No shoes allowed, leave shoes at entrance. Enablers were available on hand if needed."
4199,"Wheelchair access ramp. Spacious interior, all on one level.
Access to disabled toilet cramped, but ok"
4200,I asked the staff before I purchased a ticket if they had something to help me get into the carriage and he went to get me the steps. He was very patient and attentive as he returned to make sure I got in/ out at the midway stop and at the end of the journey.
4201,Parking at the front where the adjoining Chinese supermarket has a car park.  Usually room to park.
4202,The restaurant staff went that extra mile by carrying our tray and getting our cutlery without being asked.
4203,"This review is for the Mary Quant exhibition which has just opened and is on until 16 February 2020. The exhibition covers the 1950s to 1970s, lots of clothing including mini skirts and hot pants, Quant's own make up brand and accessories. The entire exhibition is step free."
4204,"I had very little interaction with staff, apart from Bon Marche. I was served by Marcel (hope I've spelt her name right), and when I told her how pleased I was about the accessible changing room, she told me how pleased she was to hear that and she came round and gave me a hug. She said she would untie the red cord immediately and explained that staff are available to assist customers in the way that best meets their needs."
4205,"Exterior parking to the Railway station is limited and expensive. However, as the Railway Station is located by the town centre, there are other options of parking nearby such as a multi-story."
4206,"I did not witness an accessible loo, but I'd be surprised if there wasn't one considering the amount of work they have put in to make the hotel as accessible as possible. "
4207,"I don’t think there was anywhere I couldn’t access but the area around the small children’s fair was the most difficult as it’s on loose stone .

The gardens were accessible but I suspect after a lot of rain it would be challenging as the paths are grass. But it was well worth the effort.

There is a large steam driven carousel, which has two ‘dragons’ which contain 2 bench seats and it doesn’t go up and down like the horses. The ride is up 2 steep stairs though. The attendants are very helpful and stop the ride and will assist you if you can manage the stairs. 

All 3 of the steam trains are accessible and the attendants will help you get on and off but you cannot ride in a wheelchair , you must be able to stand and walk a few steps. 

Plenty of outdoor seating for rests and picnics. 

The cafe is accessible from one end with indoor seating and a covered outdoor area with tables and chairs . There is not a huge amount of room inside for wherlchairs ."
4208,"There is plenty of disabled parking available, and it's possible (and advisable) to book and pay for this in advance. Discounts are available for blue badge holders. Assistance is available, if needed, to get you from the car to the venue. The car park is a fair distance from the entrance, and there's a road that needs to be crossed. There is also a drop-off area approx. 150m from the main entrance.
The O2 can also be accessed by tube and various bus routes as well as via the Thames Clipper. The nearest tube station (North Greenwich) is reportedly fully accessible."
4209,Very kind and helpful
4210,"The café is about a mile from the train station, & car parking nearby is limited. However, taxis drop clientele off directly outside the café, & there are several bus stops nearby. The pavements are in places uneven, with some of the kerbs being rather steep to get up & down, but there are proper crossings on the main road if not on the side streets."
4211,This restaurant is situated close to the Kings' Theatre. The menu is flexible and the food was wonderful. The service is good and is friendly and helpful. This is a real find! 
4212,LOADS of accessible parking bays.
4213,I've been to the National Theatre before - but had forgotten how good the access is! Everything from parking to the lifts to the loos - and most importantly the auditorium and the great view from the accessible seats was ace!
4214,Although it is on a Main Street there are plenty of on street parking spaces in the surrounding residential streets offering free level access parking.
4215,"This is a large detached house that will sleep up to ten people. The house is adapted for a wheelchair user. The adapted bedroom is upstairs and there is a lift inside the house for this. The bedroom has a track hoist, and fully adapted bathroom. The kitchen and lounge are large. There is a heated indoor pool with hoist etc. The gardens are beautiful. We had a wonderful  holiday in this property. On arrival we were met by the couple who are the caretakers, they were very helpful. Tenby and surrounding areas have plenty to do and see."
4216,"Transport not applicable; parking directly outside lodge, firm ground for wheelchair. Just on edge of Bellingham."
4217,The reception staff were happy to discuss options for parking and were happy for me to look around the place and answer any questions I had. When visiting during meetings on a Sunday there has always been two people at the door ready to make visitors feel very welcome and included. 
4218,The car park has many disabled parking spaces close to the entrance which is ideal for individuals who have trouble getting around. There are also bus stops.  
4219,I had a fantastic experience at Twickenham Stadium. The disabled access is great as it is very spacious and easy to get through. When it is very busy is quite hard to get to your seat
4220,The toilets are OK but few in number and you might well have to queue for a while.
4221,Some parking bays now have bollards preventing access to people like myself from using them because you can’t get off onto the pavements!
4222,All level access.
4223,All very pleasant. Particular thanks to the young man who answered the phone and dashed off to check the accessible toilet so he could answer my questions about it before we booked for lunch.
4224,A welcome retreat from the only hour's rain in a week!
4225,"I am rating this purely on its location, as I didn't go into the toilet.

From the wheelchair spaces in the theatre, a door to the corridor is directly behind them and this is where the accessible toilet is - very close.

The toilet was locked but with a sign on it saying this was so it was only used by people with disabilities, and that staff could be asked to open it. (A radar key may have also done it!)"
4226,"All the staff were very welcoming. The lady serving at the café was very proactive, she said she would carry my tray over to the table for me. When I asked her where the disabled toilet, she said she wasn't sure and directed me inside the main building. Inside the Cathedral a lady got me the radar key straight away, as I don't have my own, and said that there is always one kept in the gift shop."
4227,Had to untie red cord and add a cord card. Not space for transferring unless you could move the bin. All appropriate rails. 
4228,We met a couple of the volunteers on the day and I was impressed by their enthusiasm and knowledge. 
4229,"During my visit to Pizza Express I did not visit the accessible toilet, but I did take a photo. I can imagine that it wouldn’t be spacious enough for someone to transfer with some assisting. You would also only be able to transfer from the left side of the toilet and I don’t think there would be a lot of room at the front of the toilet because of where the sink is located (see image below). The door to enter the accessible toilet is a sliding door, I’m not sure if this would be easier or harder as I can’t open doors myself anyway. It could be quite difficult to line up a wheelchair and pull the door.

There is no Changing Places toilet at the Ocean Terminal shopping centre. The closest one is at Royston Wardieburn Community Centre which is a 13 minute drive and approximately a 53 minute walk away from Ocean Terminal."
4230,"My wife could get around with her zimmer no problem.

"
4231,2 large doors with little space between them making it a tight squeeze for wheelchair users. Doors are rather heavy so may require some assistance.
4232,The lady in the gift shop was very nice and helpful I went around the gift shop whilst my husband went on the cable car so was on my own. 
4233,A lot of youngsters not very well educated on accessibility
4234,"The restaurant is directly  accessible from the street,  very spacious with wheelchair access available to seventy-five percent of the tables, with staff at hand to assist if required or move seats if needs be,"
4235,I mentioned to staff that I was visually impaired and found them very helpful with any additional information I needed.
4236,"I love this airport for London access, but it has a few challenges. It's a very small airport with 5 or so check in desks downstairs and departure area upstairs. Distances are very small for an airport, the lift to departures is mere feet from the check in area and the upstairs not that much larger. You can stay independent right to the gate if you prefer to do that, just ask at the bag drop for a tag, let them know you will go through on your own, then meet them at the gate. Here's the big downside - they don't have a lift, they have a stairclimber. That's why I knocked off two stars. You go down in a lift with the assistance staff, then you have to transfer at the bottom of the steps, and two members of staff will bump you painfully up the steps on an electric stair climber, which ratchets up one step at a time. "
4237,To be honest the access is not the best but the staff are really helpful so it doesn't matter. 
4238,"The hotel access could be difficult without planning ahead, however lovely hotel with friendly staff"
4239,"The accommodation was very accessible, with hoist in bedroom and bathroom, adaptable kitchen unit (depending on height), spacious and well maintained lodge and there was lots of information available on the other attractions available in the local area. "
4240,"Car Park across the road, covered walkway to venue and lifts to get to ground floor."
4241,Pretty good! For this visit we were in hospitality so they were a lot warmer than usual!
4242,friendly owners. easy access throughout. Felt relaxed all week.
4243,Decent sized accessible loo with sliding door - clean and tidy. Star knocked off for a short red emergency cord which did not reach anywhere near the floor. 
4244,"There were no steps to access the cafe and level access throughout. It wasn't very clear that there was a second over-spill seating area, which could have made things easier. Each table had a removable seat, allowing for flexible seating arrangements. The over-spill seating area did have some raised benches which were not accessible as we were a group of three wheelchair users. "
4245,There are pedestrianised streets with good level surfaces and access ramps. Some shops have steps at their entrances.  One that we visited had a ramp which was quickly erected for us
4246,One accessible toilet. Clean and the red cord touched the ground. No photo as there is one from the previous review. I also liked the fact the door was not heavy so I could open and close it myself and there was plenty of room for me to turn around and open the door.
4247,"Doorway into cafe are wide and gangway to queue provides lots of space to manouver a wheelchair or other mobility aid. 
Counter is lowered to allow better access to the pin machine. 
Loud music was playing throughout visit. 
My drink was served with a paper straw. No information on materials were available. 
Moving into the seating area poses a greater issue. There are are large amount of tables and the walkways are not wide enough. "
4248,Large and clean accessible loo at the back of the shop.
4249,I drove myself to the restaurant. There is parking in the Waitrose carpark opposite and you can also safely cross the road using the pelican crossing. There is some disabled on street park nearby and you can of course also park safely on the high street on a double yellow line as long as you make sure you park in the wider section of the street.
4250,"Parking is super easy there is a Car Park attached to Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre and there are dedicated Blue Badge spaces. If travelling by bus, loads of Lothian buses stop at Ocean Terminal and they are all wheelchair accessible."
4251,"As its on Frederick Street, there's not really disabled parking but it's well serviced by the buses on Princes Street "
4252,The staff were very helpful.
4253,Parking might be tricky as it's a fairly busy stretch of road; there are parking bays outside. It's also on the main bus route from and to town so there are loads of accessible buses.
4254,"Excellent accessibility for wheelchair users. Manual wheelchairs available to borrow at the start of the tour. There is only one stretch of the tour you can't do in a wheelchair, and any member of staff will take you on a delicious and fascinating detour, a lovely bonus for wheelchair users, to 'bridge the gap'. You don't miss anything, it's just that you don't actually roll through St Stephen's Chapel."
4255,Very helpful and knowledgeable.
4256,"Great food in a great area of Glasgow, but despite the best efforts of the staff it was let down by poor access."
4257,"Automatic sliding doors, platform or conventional lifts, good signage, an excellent accessible loo, friendly and helpful staff, a pleasant cafe and excellent displays on the history of Amsterdam - what's not to like?"
4258,A National Trust park which welcomes disabled visitors warmly. They provide a double buggy which is great for carers! The paths are well surfaced and provide good access to most of the grounds. If you bring your own buggy it is possible to go off the permitted paths with care. An excellent map is provided.
4259,"Easily accessible, but a few serious issues that need addressing."
4260,"The car parks involve a long push and ride, but ramps are provided throughout your visit, and all you need to enjoy a visit, or a stay, are mainly on the level, but sadly, there are so many steps as you explore, so it’s not wheelchair friendly, but you may be able to cope as we did, if you can manage a step or two and can take a few steps forward on your own, then staff will assist you all the way, they are all so friendly and helpful. Inside the main attractive house, there are NO lifts, lots and lots of attractive staircases, steps to get down to see this or that, sometimes a bit of a tight spot to put up with, but if you can cope by yourself as and when needed, the efforts will be more than rewarded with your visit here.  We certainly saw all we wanted to see, and gladly put up with any inconveniences so that we could enjoy our visit."
4261,"Two trails at the Newberry National Volcanic Monument in the Deschutes National Forest in Oregon, Whispering Pines trail and Molten Land trail, were flat or with gentle slopes and paved—very easy access. They begin behind the visitors center which is also accessible (including their restrooms). It’s an absolutely beautiful place—unique sights of lava beds and surrounding terrain, flora and wildlife. We drove to Lava Butte—incredible view! My power chair made it to the top of Lava Butte, but it is a very steep trail, not intended to be ADA."
4262,"The church is located near the centre of Bracknell & is easily accessible by road, rail & bus, being only a few minutes from both the bus & rail stations. The church has two bulidings; the main building (Kerith Centre) is fully accessible to the ground floor, but has no lift access to the first floor. The ancillary building (K2) is fully accessible to both ground and first floors."
4263,Lovely lady who gave us our tickets and made conversation.
4264,Car park opposite.
4265,There was a gentleman using it he carried his computer out with him. He was young and not all disabilities are visable so I shall give him the benefit of the doubt. It was clean. Easy to use. Very set up for the mobile disabled but no changing table for more disabled folk. 
4266,"Spoke to a few members of staff (at the bar and in the virtual reality tent). The bar staff were friendly if very inexperienced, and the people in the VR tent were packing up but apologetic. Staff maintaining the pop-up by collecting cups and litter were very friendly."
4267,First you have to go through one door to get into a space which includes the accessible loo and the cleaner's cupboard.  You will probably need to ask someone to open the door for you. If you are in a wheelchair you should be fine.  I drove forward on my scooter to get inside the cubicle but had awful problems reversing out.  Next time I'll know better. It was big enough for a carer and it was clean.
4268,"Disabled parking outside every lodge, although ours (Cardy) didn't have an allocated blue badge space in front of the lodge as the others did. "
4269,"Access into the market is extremely easy. It is all on flat ground, and once you're inside the building, there is plenty to space to navigate a wheelchair around. There is also an upstairs level to this restaurant, but I'm unsure if there was a lift which made it wheelchair accessible. If not, it's not a massive issue, as the majority of foods are all situated downstairs."
4270,The shop was busy when I visited but you can get in as a wheelchair user and see everything.
4271,"Great toilet, handrails and enough space "
4272,"Overall this was a wonderful base for us  explore the Rhine and Mosel valleys. The hotel staff all spoke great English and went out of their way to accommodate and help. Our standard double room was very spacious with room for our power chair. The room was 3rd floor but a tightly squeezed lift got us up there.  Fortunately Susan has some mobility, which was needed because the bathroom is not accessable for a chair and the hotels entrance ramp is very steep. Worth getting a travel kettle and some tea bags etc as not provided in room. Free parking."
4273,"We immediately booked when we heard the Palm Court had reopened at the Balmoral Hotel, we usually go once a month, so we really missed it.

The service and quality of their afternoon tea is what you would expect and it doesn’t disappoint."
4274,"We arrived via taxi, though the car park is just a stone's throw away.  No idea about public transport."
4275,"The is an accessible toilet and it has a great sign on it that says ""not all disabilities are visible"".
It's a bit of a squeeze but there's just enough room for my wheelchair and my carer to come into the toilet if needed.
The accessible toilet has grab rails and an emergency red cord.
It's usually is clean and tidy but if not, such as if the soap is missing the customer service desk is happy to rectify that.
The signs for the toilets are easy to find."
4276,Excellent - see website / photos for detailed spec - meets a broad range of requirements.
4277,"There are disabled parking spaces at the entrance to the FVSC. We arrived via train at Camelon which is right across the street, less than a 2 minute walk. "
4278,"Cambridge Cineworld is a multiscreen cinema situated at the Cambridge Leisure Complex. Access is good overall - there is step-free access to all areas via a lift in the foyer of the Leisure Complex. Wheelchair spaces are available in all screens, and can be pre-booked, though assistance may be required with the heavy double doors into each screen. Inside these doors, there is a slope (with handrail) leading upward to the screen. The wheelchair spaces are quite close to most of the screens, which may not be the ideal location to appreciate the film. Audio-described and autism-friendly screenings are advertised on the cinema's website, and assistance dogs are permitted."
4279,Flat entry and most of the area is wide and flat. The exception is the coffee bar which looked lovely but there are steps to the tables by the window with sea views.
4280,"I love this hotel for a lot of reasons, not least of which is the support I receive as a disabled person.  To provide examples:

I am prone to falls and fell in the bar on 18th November (and I'd only had one drink, honest).  The female bartender, helped by fellow guests, untangled me from my rollator and got me on my feet.  I felt embarrassed and was really appreciative that no major fuss was made.

I have a toilet seat raiser for the loo in my room and two mattresses, one on top of the other, as the bed is otherwise too low.

Staff in the dining room help by carrying dishes to the table for me.  The main entrance to the dining room is up 2 steps but these are avoidable by entering through the bar via a lift to the rear of the restaurant.  I have learnt arrive smartly in order to obtain a table where my rollator isn't in anyone's way and which is close to the food servery.

Unfortunately, the hotel may be less than suitable for wheelchair users as the food is buffet service and there is no room for a wheelchair user to help themselves to whatever takes their fancy.  (It is possible a waiter may help, as happened with me on one occasion when the dining room was crowded;.  As already noted, the staff are helpful.
"
4281,Parking is limited outside the store but there are other stores close by
4282,"Access is doable via a slope at the main entrance, but you have to hope for someone to be coming out unless you have 3 hands, 2 to hold your wheels and 1 to pull the door open!"
4283,"Great! You can enter on the ground floor from New Bridge Street West, or you can enter on the first floor from the side of the building (Princess Square entrance). On the ground floor there is a help point with friendly and helpful staff. There are two lifts that lead up to the other levels of the library."
4284,"There is car parking available right next to the train station, with a few disabled car parking spaces. "
4285,They’re fairly helpful but as a disabled guest bursting for the toilet they were fairly reluctant to help me gain access ahead of the people who just didn’t want to queue for the other men’s/ladies toilets. 
4286,"James St is a Metro link as a result as well as the station there are a number of local buses that stop outside or near to the hotel.
There is also a Taxi rank at the door and all of the Taxi we used could take a wheelchair so no need to book one as there was normal 3 in the rank.
There is no on street parking due to the number of buses etc in the area"
4287,Staff are great & the food is a high standard but they have not thought about customers in wheelchairs.
4288,"A must for art lovers! Based in Festival Square, this immersive exhibition of Van Gogh’s masterpieces come to life with the help of classical music.

The exhibition is completely accessible and we went at 10:30am so there was space to ensure that we felt safe. It is advertised as a COVID safe environment and it has fresh air filtering through.

We have not experienced anything like this and thoroughly enjoyed every minute!"
4289,Those we asked permission of to see various places of interest were very helpful and kind.
4290,No. 35 bus to the door; Slateford train station near.
4291,"Staff were excellent from the point of spotting my arrival through to assisting with getting in via the accessible route, to help at the registration counter and at points during the event."
4292,"Would always recommend Wetherspoons, because it's a chain and therefore the menu is always the same (can be a down side)  but also great for planning meals which is important for some access requirements. 
They are also all accessible. "
4293,"Plenty of on street parking, and car parks "
4294,Transport and parking is the same as written in my review of Derby Intu.
4295,Situated close to accessible bays in the car-park.
4296,"We had our family holiday at Summerfield Farm. This is a great base for a nice holiday. Our daughter has cerebral palsy and is a full time wheelchair user. As a consequence we find it very hard to find suitably adapted accommodation.
Ideally, we need a single storey property. The cottage we stayed in is two storey but has a double bedroom and accessible bathroom. When we booked we had decided that it would be sufficiently accessible for our needs.
The accommodation was lovely. Beautifully clean and nice and homely. The owners are on hand, just a few meters away, and we found them welcoming and friendly. I would have awarded 5 stars. The only reason for a small reduction is the absence of ceiling tracking for hoisting and a en-suite bathroom for the ground floor bedroom (although it was just in the next room across the hall). I must stress, our daughter is profoundly physically disabled. The accommodation was adequate for us. For a less disabled person it would be ideal.
The location is very quiet but just a short drive into Whitby, or a slightly longer picturesque walk down the disused railway line. The route takes you over the very impressive Larpool viaduct. Look over the edge if you dare!
If you have bikes you can cycle the other way, down the cinder track, all the way to Scarborough. It's a very safe ride with lots of good views and some places to stop for refreshment. If you need, there is cycle hire at Hawkser. Of course, with a car, there are lots of other places to see in North Yorkshire.
In summary, a super place to stay, with great hosts and lots to see and in area."
4297,"To the room itself therew is normally only 2 steps and then further steps depending on how high you want to sit in the stands. I explained my needs to the staff and they got me a chair straightaway so I didn't have to stand and wait as there is normally about 20 minutes waiting time out side the venue and then they showed me the way up the ramp to avoid the steps. At the top of the ramp, the chair was waiting for me again and I got first admittance into the hall to chose the front row seats in my stand so that I didn't have to use any stairs there either. Incredibly beautiful and accessible building with lots of space. Other gripe I would have is there was a lose floorboard next to our seats which with lots of people walking over it shook our seats causing a flair in my chronic pain. Easily fixed though!"
4298,Inside the bar is very accessible and with plenty of space BUT there is about a 20cm step at the front door.
4299,"Nearest tube stations are Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus neither which are step free. Nearest step free tube is Green Park and then bus no 14, 19 or 38 to Shaftsbury Avenue. China Exchange is on Gerrard Street, the main street in London's Chinatown. It is pedestrianised from 12noon to 6am, with the nearest drop off point is Macclesfield Street."
4300,"The church is surrounded by cobbled streets where cyclists, market traders and tourists throng. The entrance is wide, with only a slight door sill that will not be a problem for anyone who is self-propelling. The floor consists of stone flags and gravestones but is reasonably even. A ramp gives access to the choir area.  There are a couple of side rooms which are not wheelchair accessible. Circulating spaces are good."
4301,"Lovely food, friendly, atmospheric restaurant"
4302,"There are many car parking areas available for your use here, and on this part two of our reviews we tell you about the main car park, but suggest you take the directions as shown on our part one review so as to get you comfortably settled into hotel while your carer takes the car to this car park if you did not manage to find a empty disabled bay. It will be well worth the short walk back to reception for your carer.
The grounds are very well cared for, evergreen shrubs provide wonderful photos, ideal for special occasion memories.

This time, if approaching front of NutHurst Grange, take the right hand drive (photo 1) which leads to a large car park (photo 2), but again we suggest your driver takes you first of all to the reception and leave you inside the hotel, while they return to the main car park. A pathway ahead, with four steps (photo 3) led the way to reception and this path went through lovely flower beds and a lawn (photo 4) with a private Helipad ready if you came with your own helicopter. 
The path led to the terrace garden (photo 5) and four steps led to reception (photo 6).
Later on, after settling in, from reception there is a very scenic walk (photo 7) which led past beautiful gardens (photo 8) and ahead was a large manicured lawn with a variety of trees and shrubs (photo 9). A few yards away is the delightful looking functions building (photo 10) where your special occasion, such as weddings, anniversaries, birthdays, are catered for (photo 11).
In the far right hand corner there is a ramp available (photo 12) that takes you down to the formal garden (photo 13) with trimmed hedges that highlight the statues (photo 14).
Back up the ramp, a path by the wooden shed will lead you to the orchard (photo 15)
Then just return to the main drive and be pushed back to the Grange (photo 16) and then by the terrace garden (photo 17) is the reception entrance (photo 18).
Following your walk, why not rest in the comfy lounge (photo 19) while you enjoy the last views over the gardens, (photo 29) with perhaps a little drink, before you either depart for the return journey home, of if you have booked an overnight stay, then rest here before going to your room to prepare for dinner.

Our final thoughts
What a delightful way to spend an hour or two just wandering around the beautiful gardens. 
"
4303,"So is a wheelchair accessible cafe in the centre of Aberdeen. It had lovely food, helpful staff and an accessible loo. Well worth a try if you're in or around the area."
4304,Accessible toilet is large and spacious with handrails emergency pull cord hangs all the way to the floor and is easily accessible 
4305,Good having an accessible toilet in the mens.
4306,There is a disabled toilet downstairs but it isn't fully equipped with a hoist etc. and the door is quite heavy. It's also a bit small for big chairs.
4307,"The restaurant is located on Broughton Street which has a bit of a slope and is busy with traffic. There were some cars parked directly outside, but it isn't really an on-street parking kind of venue. There is however a really handy bus stop right outside the front door served by wheelchair-accessible Lothian Buses."
4308,"Open plan layout and spacious feel, with a wide, automatic door at the entrance for wheelchair users. At the moment Silverburn is all on one level, (I think they are currently expanding, so that may change in the future). Some of the larger shops like H&M and Debenhams are on two floors, but they have easy to access lifts."
4309,"Easily accessed via wheelchair/powerchair, car, bus or train due to being close-by to Northumberland Street, an undergound multi-storey car-park underneath the venue, Haymarket and Eldon Square bus stations and Newcastle Central Station. Most buses have ramps and there are a good number of disabled parking bays."
4310,"Very Accessible Hotel, wheelchair Lift at front entrance, very good security and Lift access and accessible rooms"
4311,"The staff are always very willing to help and keen for everyone to take part in activities, no matter what your disability."
4312,"A pain in the backside if you are only visiting the cinema or restaurants (which is where I mostly go) because the only point to get parking validated is at the far end of the shopping centre, IE the furthest point from the cinema and restaurants. Good toilet facilities, but don't forget your radar key."
4313,This hotel is situated in the center of town by all the main attractions. Disabled parking is available free with a blue badge in the car park opposite the hotel. Flat or lift access to all levels. Many wheelchair accessable rooms and two with a bed that can be moved up and down for easy care of the disabled person in bed. Wheel- in shower and shower chair available on request.
4314,Valley view is all on one level with no steps to manoeuvre. Doors are wide enough to comfortably get a wheelchair through.  The cooker and sink are on a unit that is alterable according to height need as is the basin  in the bathroom and dressing table in the bedroom. 
4315,Friendly and helpful.
4316,Accessible toilet down small corridor adjacent to reception; large uncluttered clean toilet with appropriate grab rails etc.
4317,Level access throughout. A friendly atmosphere within renovated church building
4318,"The staff are great, very approachable and there is enough of them to help everybody."
4319,"There is a good accessible loo in the main lobby, and the disabled bedroom had very good disabled facilities - grab rails, shower seats etc - all very clean and well maintained"
4320,"Bus stop 500 yards
Disabled parking for rear and side exit"
4321,"If you like cheese, you'll love this cafe. It's small, good for takeaway or a quick sit-in and has level access through an open door (with a curtain)."
4322,"Superbly equipped holiday lodges for disabled people and their family or friends in an amazing location.  Ideally situated to get out and about in the East Neuk of Fife and beyond.  For relaxing ""at home"" days, each lodge has beautiful gardens and private outdoor space with views of the sea and links golf course.  Brilliant, helpful and friendly Reception and cafe staff makes Homelands the No. 1 holiday destination for disabled people in Scotland."
4323,"Our guide for the tour was Andrea and she was very friendly and welcoming. She always sure I was managing around the tour in my wheelchair, making sure I was at the front of the tour group so that I could always see and was very helpful by not filling my wine tasting cups too high so that I could lift it."
4324,Nice pub with good level access inside - let down by no accessible toilet .
4325,Easy to get in through power operated doors. Accessible toilet. Tables and chairs moveable.
4326,"On arriving it was easy to get in via the large automated glass doors. The reception has a dropped area and the routes around the building well signposted. It was great to be able to explore the unexpected areas like the rooftop viewing point. A lift, escalator or stairs takes you to the different levels. There was plenty of circulation space around the different galleries and exhibits."
4327,"Pretty good. A long smooth ramp up to the accessible entrance which is clearly signposted by a chalkboard. Inside, the tables are nicely spaced apart and chairs are movable. It's table service. The restaurant is nice and bright with natural light in the conservatory. "
4328,"exceptionally friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the venue and access requirements."
4329,"The access for The Kitchin is great, with the only issue being the cobbles on the path outside. The food was fantastic and the service was amazing, a real experience!"
4330,Staff were lovely. Very friendly and welcoming but they couldn't fix the issues that made the facility inaccessible to us. 
4331,There is a step at the front door but easy wide access at back door and paving slabs outside made it easy to push or power a wheelchair from a car.
4332,"Two disabled spaces, near loft."
4333,I think the manager served us and he was very good. The other staff seemed pleasant. \i think there just weren't enough of them.
4334,"Excellent, staff were welcoming, friendly, proactive and very helpful. When I wasn't sure where to sit the box office attendant suggested going over to the entrance of the auditorium to look at the cinema layout. When I got there the member of staff suggested sitting in one of the boxes and took me through to see the facilities. When I was ready to go into the cinema the member of staff checking my ticket went and opened both the doors for me."
4335,"My carer drove me there in my own WAV. To my surprise the council have a multistorey carpark behind the theatre that is well signposted, patrolled by helpful staff and free of charge. A level well lit pedestrianised route takes the audience fdom carpark to the entrance. "
4336,"We came by car, disabled parking is right next to Palace disabled entrance "
4337,Generally good access however within the restaurant it is not very spacious and could be difficult when maneuvering.
4338,Courteous and helpful.
4339,"A small threshold on the bottom of the doorway (15mm),  other than that there's plenty of space around the cafe, and of course there is good level access outside in the paving."
4340,"Arriving by tube from London Bridge I found it fairly easy to get to with short walk from the station into Borough High Street and then into the Market. There's a covered passage way on the far side of the street that takes you from the High Street into the market area. It does have a bit of a slope downward so you can avoid that by going a few metres further down the High Street where you go in via the Market Hall - a glass looking building with loads of seats, plants and an accessible loo."
4341,"Very large wetrooms, grab rails for toilet."
4342,Largest disabled loo ever encountered!  Changing places toilet with large changing table and accessible baby change table. Ceiling hoist over table and toilet.  Adjustable height sink.  Toilet with integrated washing and drying.
4343,"An accessible Leisure center with disabled parking bays close by at the rear of the building within easy reach of the ramped access to the main entrance, dropped counters at the reception where friendly staff are always on hand to assist if needed.
a selection of large, fully accessible toilets, changing rooms and shower rooms with alarm cords are available and easy to find.
Once in the building it is level access to the changing rooms and swimming areas, there is a lift to access the gym and fitness suites."
4344,"Good access to the whole park. Some activities can't be accessed but you can do the roller coaster and an excellent 1km treetop trail. Cafe access is fine, as are the toilets."
4345,Access to the station from the street was easy with a level approach to the lift to take you down to the platforms.
4346,"Easy access into the cafe as long as there's someone to help with the door.  The door was open when we visited. 

The cafe is all level access - although getting to the back section is a tight squeeze in a wheelchair.  Front section is fine, where there are about 3 tables."
4347,"Massive car park if the one at the back and plenty of spaces, for the disabled and the main stream"
4348,"
It could be difficult to get here by train or subway depending upon your disability as stations are about 10-14 minutes walk away.  I came by car and was directed into a locked car-park manned by security adjacent to the venue.  There was plenty of space and staff were very helpful, holding gates etc.  As the complex is in an old industrial area, the ground around it is a bit uneven and bumpy, especially for me in my chair but they have ramped access to the hall through automatic doors and plenty of lovely staff to hold doors etc."
4349,plenty of disabled parking near lifts
4350,"Staff could not be more helpful and friendly 

Special thanks to instructor Cat for making my first skiing experience so phenomenal!"
4351,"Cambridge Folk Festival takes place over four days in late July or early August each year. Now established for more than 50 years, it features a wide range of music of many genres from around the world. It's situated at Cherry Hinton Hall, a park to the south of the city centre, where weekend festival camping is available, though most festival-goers choose not to camp. Tickets for the full weekend or for single days are usually on sale from early December onwards - though the festival does regularly sell out. Access throughout the site is variable; there are some paths but much of the site is on grassed surfaces, so accessibility may be affected by weather conditions. The atmosphere is generally welcoming and the festival is attended by many families."
4352,The staff were fantastic. So friendly and very knowledgeable and passionate about the exhibits. A special mention must also go to the volunteer staff. The two ladies we encountered were so helpful and very friendly.
4353,"Having read mixed reviews prior to our visit to Peebles Hydro, we were slightly concerned as to what to expect.

When I made the reservation  at the end of January, I stipulated that I needed an accessible room.  (I use a wheelchair and am unable to step into a bath)  When the confirmation came through, there was no mention of an accessible room so I phoned up, only to be told that the room allocated (4118),  was indeed an accessible room.
On checking in last Wednesday, the reception was busy with other also checking in.  A good sign, I thought. When it was our turn I gave our confirmation to the receptionist and mentioned the accessible room, she told me that we were now not getting the room on the confirmation as they had a number of disabled guests staying and someone else’s needs were greater. As she had not met me before, I do not know how she (or whoever) could reach this conclusion.

Resigning ourselves to this room, I went to put the television on, only to find the remote control missing.    With a  call to reception, I was told that one would be sent down.  40 minutes later, with no remote in sight my wife went up to the reception.  On seeing her, John asked if he could assist.  On being told about the remote, John  kindly got one for us.

When it came time for dinner, we found ourselves having to go outside, get the wheelchair down a step, negotiate cars in the car park,  go back into the building through another door, into the lift to get back to the level where the dining room was.  This was the routine each time we required to be in the main building whilst in this room.

Being beside the car park and a unloading area, we found the room very noisy in the morning. 


After our first night, I decided that to raise the issue  regarding our room.   On asking for the duty manager, a nice lady called Heather came to talk to us.

On hearing our concerns, she totally agreed that the receptionist ought not to have said what she did and understood our needs for an accessible room   She asked for a few minutes to go and see what, if anything, could be done.

Heather came back shortly to advise that she could move us to a room, similar to what we were originally booked into.  We went back to room 3 to repack the case.   Heather  also came down to assist us with moving into the other room and show us round the room.

 Just as I hoped for when I made the booking to stay at Peebles Hydro.  The additional bonus was that it had a lovely view over to the Cademuir Hills.  

In hindsight, I wish I had made a fuss when we checked in, but in reality,  I should not have needed to do so.



I have to say we were disappointed with the reception staff.  From the checking in debacle, remote control issue and then on checking out.  A simple ‘have you enjoyed your stay with us?’ would have been nice.  

Such touches encourage people to come back.  Perhaps we just got a member of staff on an off day or was very busy, I don’t know. 

On this, and If we could be guaranteed an accessible room, we would certainly consider a re-visit to Peebles Hydro in the future."
4354,FULL CHANGING PLACES TOILET WITH HOIST AND BENCH
4355,Staff all aware of loop requirements on counters.
4356,"The staff were friendly and helpful, but would have liked to seen a few more wandering around the exhibition itself to ask directions or where a specific exhibit was."
4357,"From out visits, Chester Zoo is mostly accessible including the monorail, boat trip on the Islands and the restaurants. Pathways are generally wide and flat. Customer Service good. The monorail will discount carers to go free. If you ask a member of staff they will direct you to a separate entrance to the boat trip on the Islands where you can receive priority boarding if you have a disability and helped into the boat via a ramp if you are a wheelchair user."
4358,"Parking was provided in a makeshift farmers yard which was hard standing, but had no markings. Members of staff had no comprehension of what space wheelchair users need, and ended up blocking vehicles from both wheelchair access, as well as blocking the ability of cars to get out of the car park.  For our visit, it required announcements to the whole arena to get drivers back to vehicles to move them so that customers could leave!

The venue is in a field along a countryside lane that has no pavements, and is 0.5 miles from the nearest main road. Buses in the area are infrequent, on Saturdays there is a bus at 10am, 2pm and 4pm.  On Sundays, four buses operate at 11am, 1pm, 4pm and 6pm but are accessible for a single wheelchair."
4359,"Large clean toilet.
"
4360,"An accessible toilet on the ground floor. Large, clean and well equipped. Door can be tricky as it opens into the flow of people visiting the male toilets."
4361,"The staff were very rude and didn't want us on the site, only allowed us on the sight for 1 night but we had to share our friends pitch who had a campervan."
4362,"very accessible and accommodating, good access to the building with ramps all around however if you have a wheelchair it might be worth talking to the staff about parking in the back of the venue as although there are ramps at the front wider chairs may struggle to get around one or two tighter corners after entering. although staff will help with getting you around."
4363,This was a very welcoming venue with incredibly helpful staff who couldn't have done any more to accommodate me ; the food was lovely and well-priced.
4364,"Well...... The accessible toilet was interesting!!

There is one male, one female and one accessible toilet.

These are in the small entrance area, and people can be waiting in this area too. It is quite a tight turn to get from the restaurant to the accessible toilet. 

I was very surprised to find the accessible  
toilet is where they also store the children's highchairs!!
Meaning the toilet was actually not accessible... And that all young children have a very unhygienic dining experience!! (would you want your dining table leaning against a toilet?)

It has a sliding door, which obviously saves on space, but can be tricky to close and lock. 

There is a folding support arm to the left side (if sitting on the toilet) but this could not be used due to the highchairs.

The emergency red cord was tied in a knot around this, and could not be used.

The sink is immediately in front of the toilet, leaving little room if transferring. 

The baby changing area is also in this toilet "
4365,"Super spacious toilet, lots of circulation and left hand transfer space. A star knocked off as there is no alarm and being down a corridor through two doors it is needed. "
4366,There are accessible toilets on some of the piers or the nearby car parks.
4367,"Joined the tour of the Commonwealth War Graves in our local Cemetery as part of the Doors Open Day Dumfries & Galloway 2021. Fascinating and informative tour in a peaceful environment , casualties from both World Wars are laid to rest here, including Canadians, Australians, Germans, Italians, Czechoslavakians , Norwegians and British. Talk about various Graves, the work of the CWGC & the individuals buried there.
The area of the cemetery where the Commonwealth Graves are situated is reasonably accessible, but older areas of the cemetery dating back to the 14 th Century would not be accessible to wheelchairs. Much of the older areas are on a hill. 
"
4368,"Level, but a pull door to get into shop, easy enough for carer to open for you."
4369,"Very polite and will always carry your food and drinks to you, and if they are not busy will have a little chat, it you want to!"
4370,Specific access for users through a security gate (see their website) for parking on a hard surface right next to the main building.
4371,My carer drove me and we parked in the car park 
4372,Plenty of space but no grab rails.
4373,"Visited here, with my walker, my disability means i have trouble steps and slopes. No steps at all here which is rare and great, lots of space to get through with my walker and to leave it at the side of the table. The staff wanted to help as much as they can, asking where i wanted to sit- what was best and how they could help, allowing me time to settle (i'm not very speedy). Well done staff for making the experience comfortable. Disabled toilet at the back of the restaurant, only down side is parking is hard as its in town but there is trinity square car park behind."
4374,The staff are fantastic and will make you well they all give there first names and tell you to let them know if you need anything the service is good and your meal will be served to you as soon as it is ready
4375,On the street very few spaces you just have to park where a blue badge allows traffic wardens move you on even on yellow lines which is allowed so not great.
4376,"I’m not sure how many accessible toilets there are but I saw one just across from the food court area. It was beside the the male and female toilets.

The accessible toilet was a decent size and a wheelchair user and someone to assist them would be able to fit in however, if you need to transfer from the left side of the toilet you would struggle as the toilet is closer to the wall at that side. See photo below. Also I didn’t see an emergency red cord hanging down and there was a big black bin in the accessible toilet taking up a lot of space, a smaller bin would make it easier for customers to move around and transfer from the right side of the toilet if they needed to."
4377,"Toilets were the only thing not well signposted, but I did spot them. Didn't use them as they were being cleaned when I was there, so can't comment much."
4378,Easy access from main entrance to the disabled seating with ramped access with a  great view to the main arena.
4379,"There is some on street parking at the side of the hotel but it is very expensive during the day. Try to find out position for blue badge holders. Free from 6 pm to 8 am.
Hotel has deals with various car parks but prices vary. Watch out for dedicated cycle way  between pavement and road.
Waterloo Street is on bus routes for airport and long distance destination s but it is a one way street leading out of town."
4380,"Good signage, v wheel friendly."
4381,"All the staff at Touchbase so lovely and helpful,"
4382,All ready done
4383,There is a quite a high metal threshold (1/1.5 inches) to get over to get in the front door. 
4384,Level access and plenty of space inside. 
4385,Great ground for disabled access. No messing around. Quick and easy ??
4386,"Doubles as baby change, but still reasonably spacious."
4387,"Clumber Park is one of our favourite places for a day out. It's just off the A1 so it's easy to get to. There are good toilet facilities and places to get food and drink. Best of all, there are lots of walks. Our favourite walk is to go anti-clockwise around the lake, which is about 5 miles, I think."
4388,"Best disabled friendly accommodation in France.
More like a family home, there needs to be no adjustment. You arrive unpack and start your holiday immediately. 
Have no worries about any mechanical problems with wheelchairs etc. Carl and Max have a very well equipped workshop and are both very competent at any engineering work
. Dogs, pig and cats abound and welcome all the family.
 Fabulous area we have been going since the first year they opened , often twice per year my severely handicapped daughter loves it all and we find new places whenever we visit and the food ahhhhhhh.
 Have no hesitation in recommending La Roche and commend the weekly barbecue."
4389,"Access in and around the building:

Arriving at the hotel the large automatic doors opened as a wheeled up to them in my powerchair. There was level access from the street and the reception was the in front of me after I entered. The reception desk had a dropped section toward the end which made it easier for me.

The lounge area is next the the reception and bar. There’s plenty of seating with enough space for me to wheel in and be comfortable.

Two large lifts with door clearance of 110 cm and a depth of 186 cm go to all floors. The lifts were large enough for me to turn my powerchair through 360 degrees. 

Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:

The Hotel had five accessible bedrooms and all of them have the option of interconnecting rooms. There was degree of “wow” factor when I opened the door. 

The first thing I saw was a big space and across the far side some seats and a coffee table. If that was what I saw first, then where was the bed? The room was generous with its space and there was ample room to move around and enjoy the space.

The bed was large and it was easy to wheel to either side; not always possible in some accessible rooms. A door led off the room to an adjoining room – all the accessible rooms could be linked to a second room.

Excitedly I wheeled into the wet room. It was one of the largest I have seen. It was 178cm by 300 cm. There was plenty of room to move around and would be large enough to accommodate a portable hoist.

One of the accessible rooms has been equipped to allow greater flexibility as the equipment can be moved or removed according to the guest's requirements.

Access in the dining area:

The dining area is on the ground floor. There was ample space to get in and move around. The furniture was moveable and could move to accommodate me comfortably.

Access to other facilities:

The hotel also has a small gym on one of the lower floors. Not a gym user I did venture in to have a look."
4390,Loo was clean spacious and well appointed
4391,The venue is laid out to suit the needs of people in wheelchairs the door in to the office opens in the way but is a good wide door. There are a number of seats on the right hand side of the door as you go to allow people to sit until staff can assist them.
4392,"Great. Right at the entrance, clearly signed and with a red cord hanging correctly."
4393,"There is automated entrance doors, platform lift and lifts to all floors, to provide step free access.

On this visit I attended the Global Clinic tour in one of their galleries, which offered a touch tour, speech to text and BLS interpreter. Tour was very inclusive and met the needs of disabled people with a wide variety of needs. 
"
4394,The staff at Jake's Bar and Restaurant and at Lochanhully were all really good and very helpful.
4395,"Very clean with decent hand dryer and hand wash, also has baby changing facilities"
4396,A ramp that was not great NO Disabled Toilets.
4397,"No steps, completely flat except for a very small ramp to go to the gym and one of the smaller sports halls. Apart from that you can access every room.

It must be good if you've got so many disability sports clubs running down there :)"
4398,"Having previously visited several other animal parks, we were impressed with Colchester zoo. On our visit, it was clean (even the disabled loo) and well-organised, with friendly staff and animals that looked like they were well cared-for. It was no problem taking part in events like feeding the elephants in a wheelchair, and it was lovely to be able to participate fully in something with my little boy. 

But... they aren't kidding when they warn you about the paths on their website. It's not just that some of them are pretty steep, even on the 'easy' route; they're also very bumpy in places. My very small Luggie scooter couldn't handle the uneven surfaces, so after a few near-capsizes, we went back and hired one of the zoo's own wheelchairs (£5), which was OK but it was lucky my partner was there to do some strong pushing!"
4399,Got parked on Queen Street which has a few disabled spaces and its just a short walk to venue
4400,"I was so disappointed. This new venue has just opened after a very pricey expansion and remodel and boasts of fantastic accessibility, I even emailed and was reassured further that I’d have fantastic views and it’d all be rosey. It was not the case, the seating arrangement was so poorly thought out, the wheelchair seating was the worst I’ve ever experienced to date. The staff were clueless, the bathrooms were small and filthy and everyone was using them because none required radar keys. You can buy a bottle of juice but they don’t let you keep the lid which is no good. You also can’t have more than a carer sitting with you, so my friend and I couldn’t sit together- I partly understand this because the disabled seating was so bad- but they need to have a complete rethink of how they are accommodating their disabled customers"
4401,"No hoist & no accessible path down to the water, however all the staff were eager to help out and make things possible. As well as the activity leader an extra person was on hand to help make the lift from the wheelchair to the canoe. A seat was attached to the canoe to provide support & stability."
4402,"El Aderno, is one of a number of cafe and restaurants in the La Paz area. This cafe specialises in cakes and ice cream."
4403,"Staff were fantastic, encouraging, friendly and all seemed to have and a good understanding of ASN. 5*"
4404,Very attentive and kind
4405,The shaded carport adjacent to the accessible flat works very well.
4406,"Accessible to wheelchairs via the ramp at the side. Large foyer with low counters, and screens 2 and 3 are downstairs and easily accessible. Spaces for wheelchairs in the screens. Access to the 2 upstairs screens requires staff help, but always willing to help customers."
4407,"There is a step outside but they are looking into getting a ramp.  Plenty of room inside, pizza s are good unusual fillings with the usual filings.  Disabled toilet, quiet space. Super friendly staff."
4408,"Easy street car parking, 1/2 mile walk to the stadium. "
4409,Excellent - we got parked outside.Loads of public transport nearby.
4410,Can only say they were getting on with there job on a Friday afternoon 
4411,There is an entrance on either side of the building (if you park or come by bus). It’s all level access throughout and no music plays in the store so I did not feel distracted or flustered.
4412,"There are various parking options within a 5 minute walk of the museum.   On cheese market days, it is highly recommended that you arrive at least an hour before the market begins to secure a nearby parking place.   If traveling by taxi, the company Accessible Travel Netherlands can make arrangements for you.  If going by public transportation, the Centraal Station is a 15 minute walk away from the Museum."
4413,"bus stop right outside the door, Lothian services 23, 27"
4414,"Good access for wheelchair/mobility scooter users, good disabled toilet. Always book table beforehand and you'll get a large table near entrance. Nice food at fair prices with picky diners well catered for."
4415,"All level access with automatic doors. Shops and toilets with good access. Lifts to allow passengers to travel to different platforms, if stairs are not an option."
4416,I've given this a four as often at the end of the night the lifts are full but I've waited too long and I'm impatient. At the intervals the toilet can also be busy.
4417,toilets are to small in pizza hut but reasonable in tenpin bowling
4418,"We continue our exploration of the historical park and hotel with our second review of this old 15th century building, and having been disappointed with our first impressions of hotel, we hope we will be more impressed with our second review for you. If you have not yet managed to read part one, may we encourage you to do so, as we have offered you a historical account of the halls beginning, with some interesting facts you can enjoy reading about at any time.
We commence our review following our coffee break in the Horse Box restaurant and we left to go through reception (photo 1) to enter the Great Hall. A large comfortable hall, with plenty of appeal, pleasantly furnished with warm overtones, offering afternoon tea, (photo 2) and we suggest you look at the old 1400,s original door, on the left of photo, with its history of having been shot at by Oliver Cromwell and bullet marks still plainly seen.  An ornate chandelier highlights the leaded glazed tall windows (photo 3) laid ready for your afternoon tea, or you may take afternoon tea luxuriating in the dying embers of a real fire, (photo 4) or perhaps you would take tea in your own little alcove as did the two ladies who kindly gave permission to show you our photo. (Photo 5). 
Out of the Great Hall, you reach the disabled toilet (photo 6) all on the level, and although it has pull cord and grab rails, it’s a very plain simple toilet, large enough to turn a wheelchair, as everything is placed against the far wall. (Photo 7).
The passage to the restaurant is by the disabled toilet. There is a ramp up to the restaurant, ( photo 8) but it is extremely steep, and very dangerous, as you could easily tip backwards.  From the ramp, it leads into a small hallway of dark rich oak wood and panelled rooms (photo 9). The restaurant (photo 10) is plush, with its dark oak panels, a huge stone fireplace with carved figurines. A large chandelier sets off the beautiful ornate ceiling. The smaller area of the restaurant (photo 11) continues with the dark oak wood theme.
Venturing outside again, we saw the level entrance into the modern Spa (photo 12) 
Which leads you into the fitness courtyard ( photo 13) containing an outside open air 
Pswimming pool (photo 14). Although a lovely sunny late October day, visitors were still enjoying the outdoor heated pool (photo 15). 
Exiting the courtyard we arrived at the main paved pathway (photo 16) which led from the gatehouse to the disabled parking bays (photo 17) for our return journey home.

Our final thoughts
This second part of our review was far more inviting, with its historical Great Hall, and plush elegant restaurant. 
However, although it had easy access into the Great Hall, you will have to face the challenge of a very steep ramp, or the three steps to reach the restaurant and the remaining guest rooms. 
Although we enjoyed this part of the hall, we still feel the danger, following a previous accident of tipping backwards at another hotel.
"
4419,Went by coach which unloaded right outside but would have needed to drive to access family gardens and butterfly house as cannot be accessed from inside and normal access is by train that I couldn't use.
4420,See above. You need staff help to move from floor to floor in the lift. They were charming and their English was excellent.
4421,"First visit to Belfast Airport, found the staff very friendly and helpful. 
Car hire companies in the airport are: Avis, Budget, Enterprise/National/Alamo, Europcar and Hertz not one of them offer a wheelchair accessible vehicle (WAV) for hire. 
Changing Places Toilet at departures ONLY."
4422,"Lovely, friendly, accommodating and welcoming; all with no hint of patronisation."
4423,The staff were very nice and extremely helpful. My Mobility Scooter fell over on the way traveling back as the van was moving around a lot and staff were good and lifted me back up.
4424,Easy and flat
4425,Fabulous welcoming 
4426,Access is well provided for. Looking forward to seeing the final visitor centre building in place. We did not visit Helix Park (basically where the Kelpies are situated) but plan to do so in the future as this looks like it would be excellent in good weather
4427,"The young ladies that served us drinks were very nice and quietly friendly, and looked after us well. We did not meet any other."
4428,Asked how to help.
4429,"The nearest tube stations to the hospital are Euston Square, which is only step free westbound, and Warren Street. The nearest step free station is King's Cross. There are also several buses that stop outside the hospital entrance on Euston Road."
4430,"Roudsea Woods are a beautiful triple SI location, there are mature trees, mosses and marshes, In summer nesting ospreys may  be seen in the distance from the boardwalk . It is an enchanting place. The Tramper route is challenging, not for the faint hearted. "
4431,"Staff have been fantastic every time I've used the station. Even at the busiest periods, they've always ensured that I got on and off the train safely. Great work!"
4432,"The main entrance doors are automatic so this enables people to gain access without having to open them doors them selves. However gaining access into a screen may be difficult for some users if they are alone, as the screens have big heavy fireproof doors that need to be pushed / pulled open."
4433,You have to park a bit away as there is no disabled parking space close to the entrance. 
4434,"So upset that I left. It’s dangerous, unsafe and degrading. "
4435,Plenty disabled parking near entrance ramp. 
4436,"Spent #Accessday out with some of the co-owners of the accessible holiday cottages in Lymington enjoying a delightful walk along the sea wall, I did a 6 miles circular tour of the coast, market and quayside in the Spring sunshine in my power chair, enjoying the wonderful solent and New Forest"
4437,Really difficult to get around and toilet was a long way from where I was. 
4438,"Driving to hotel was a pleasure (well, after getting off M6) the village of Acton Trussell is very nice, and exciting to get first view of hotel. There are disabled parking bays available right by hotel entrance."
4439,There are clearly signed disabled access store at all of the toilets . No radar key required
4440,"This outing to Malham Cove is another ""Miles without Stiles"" route -- it won't be for everyone but a great close up view of the Cove awaits if you can manage it. A route card is available free of charge from the Visitor Centre in Malham or see the National Park/Miles without Stiles webpage."
4441,"Throughout the park there are no steps on the tarmac pathway or leading to either tea rooms, however there are a few slopes on this pathway however it is very open and areas to sit down to take in the views. Both tea rooms are wheelchair accessed and therefore staff are happy to cater for the needs whether this is carrying the trays outside or bringing extra chairs out to the benches outside."
4442,"Public toilets did not have a disabled toilet, but mens and ladies where reasonably big enough to get a wheelchair in with effort, but just ordinary cubicle facilities."
4443,"Loo was accessible & quite large. Not much of a transfer area so had to do a forward transfer. There were rails & red emergency pull cord, however, this was tied up in a big knot (I left a card). Low sink. Peddle bin for the hand towels. 
It is currently still being worked on so this could change."
4444,Entrance is very spacious with automatic door 
4445,Staff were really helpful and got the tubes etc that I needed from the cycle section.
4446,"This place is the place be at the store, it's right beside the brilliant Edinburgh Tool Library and in the ground floor of Custom Lane.

Great coffee and interesting snacks. Great place to go, sit and read a book."
4447,Again access to disabled loo was awkward for the large scooter but the facilities were exellent.
4448,Street parking only and at busy times during the week it can be hard to find a parking space. 
4449,"Although I did not use it, there is an accessible toilet in the restaurant."
4450,"The only thing that could be done better is having some toilets on the ground floor as well. The toilets that are available have very good disabled access, with large standard toilets or even larger disabled toilets if needed. These are on the first floor which is accessed by going in a lift."
4451,"Can park right outside, completely flat access from car to the door of the cottage"
4452,Helpful staff
4453,"Drove in car, parked with blue badge in George Street."
4454,So friendly and eager to help.
4455,"If you want to enjoy an amazing mix of fantasy Victorian Gothic architecture mixed up with astronomy and humour, all completely wheelchair accessible, this is the place to go."
4456,"There isn't a wheelchair accessible toilet, the toilet door looked slim and I don't think it would have been big enough for my powerchair, but we didn't check so can't say for sure. It may be suitable for manual wheelchair users"
4457,Accessibility within the venue was great. However the gravel car park is not easy to get across with a powerchair and we could not see any walkway to assist.
4458,Could not have done more
4459,Several wide disabled spaces right by the accessible door.
4460,"They are always very helpful and quick. They know that I do not like the high tables so if there's a queue, they would offer me one but ask if I would wait for 5 minutes until a low table comes free."
4461,"Can't comment on the parking. Buses 24, 63, 67, 86, 87 and 89 will get you there from different parts of the city, and the Institute is centrally located on the left bank of the Seine."
4462,Two spaces reserved for disabled parking in carpark but they are the same size as all others. There is no bus route close to the hotel. 
4463,A large accessible toilet is next to the reception area.
4464,Disabled toilet is in the lower area and was clean and pleasant.
4465,"There are disabled toilets near to car park by castle, but you need a radar key, what on earth is that, and how do you get one?
So not able to get in, tried public toilet for gents, 20 pence to use, and they are just typical run toilets, not impressed. You will have to get out of chair to use."
4466,I'm not a wheelchair user but there is a ramp.
4467,Level throughout interior. Small raised threshold at entrance. Interior seems packed full but good circulation space.
4468,Generally pleasant and helpful.
4469,The staff were personal and very accommodating to issues associated with the wheelchair. 
4470,can't review the toilet other than to say there is one as we didn't need to use it.
4471,I parked in the St Giles centre multi story car park and from the car park you have signposts directing you to the centre. 
4472,"The Toilet is situated in the specially design and adapted disabled changing room located at poolside just 2m from the pool. The toilet is unisex. The door of the changing room opens inwards. There are numerous well situated grab rails in the changing room along with a fold out table/bench and a shower with shower seat, there is also a functioning emergency alarm and disposal facilities available. Standard toilets are also available."
4473,"This is a new cafe beside Roseland Caravan Park on Canada Hill in Rothesay.
It is fully accessible with very good toilet facilities.
It's easy to get around inside the cafe and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
The views are stunning across Rothesay Bay and the chocolate cake is delicious!  Table  service from attentive staff.
The best way to arrive is by car and there is good level parking."
4474,Could be a challenge to get to and it's probably a difficulty for wheelchair users. Cant recall if disabled accessible inside
4475,"The car park is right near the Castle, parking is free for Blue Badge holders. If you mention the wheelchair when you get tickets, a wheelchair accessible vehicle can be provided to take you to the top of the castle. You can then make your way down and around, although it is cobble stones!"
4476,"I was pleasantly surprised by disabled access at the Colosseum! The first thing I saw as I walked inside was signage for an accessible route, as well as for lifts, accessible toilets, and audio and video guides. On the upper level, the floor was smooth all the way round, and the path was very wide. You get an excellent view over the entire Colosseum - but watch out for rust rubbing off of the railings onto your skin! I turned noticeably orange...
On the lower level, the terrain is bumpy, but you won't have far to travel over this ground. There are clearly marked ramps and accessible viewing platforms throughout. Watch out for various tour groups who can take up lots of space."
4477,Very caring and supportive.
4478,Good street level access. Seating inside main entrance doors - these are not automatic doors and can be considered heavy.  There are volunteers at the door to assist.  Internal - floors ar flat with lifts connecting two floors.
4479,"The new ferry terminal when working fully gives disabled people, wheelchair and scooter users ease of access. it heavily Relies on lifts and gangways to be in full working order. When they are not, things become difficult. Foot passengers on occasions need to go on by way of car deck to get in lift.  Or if lift broken In terminal there’s issues as there is no other way up to passenger lounge. The gangway is very long to walk so bear that in mind. 

the lifts are heavily used as passengers have heavy bags and stairs are steep. it’s badly designed and seems to be for the views of goat fell and no thought on access. 
If using a car please speak clearly what you need At booth and hope and pray this gets back to man on boat parking cars inside. If not roll down your window and shout if you feel your wedged in. 


However, Iv used the boat as a foot passenger with my scooter and when you get up stairs your asked by staff to go on first and it’s policy they are with you. You will be asked to go halfway down gangway and wait to go on first. The gangway is bumpy Because it moves with the tides In the joins but easy to roll over.but staff will help if needed."
4480,"Was able to book a carer / PA ticket easily online.
When we got there was a bit of a queue and an assistant took us to the front to get the exhibition headphones, which was a nice touch.
The headsets are pretty accessible - you only need to deal with the volume and nothing else. Throughout the exhibition you walk through with them on, hearing sounds and when you get close to a TV screen the sound from on the TV appears, its great but sometimes you need to get pretty close for it to 'click' on.
The exhibition is pretty much on the same level, link with ramps, it's very busy and it would be nicer if there was a little bit more space, we went at 10.30am on a Sunday and my parents went at  3.30pm on the same day and they mentioned it was incredibly busy.
The exhibition is full of drawings and objects but pretty much is explained in the companying videos, make sure you get a go on the mixing desk and mix 'Money' there's three of them and not many people realised they were interactive. "
4481,These are located to the right hand side of the venue. There was enough space inside for myself in a power chair and one assistant. Grabrails came down on either side of the toilet and I felt the sink was at a good height. You need a RADAR key to enter.
4482,"Better than the King's Theatre except for parking, but if you like curry, go early and eat in Saffrani."
4483,Everyone was very friendly and helpful.
4484,"I was there for a birthday celebration so a big table was booked and it was in the lower level. We told the restaurant a wheelchair user was part of the party and they were ready for this, however the accessible toilet was on the other level. We managed to get into the bathroom but it was very tiny and I wouldn’t have got in in my powerchair. The cubicles were too small to close the door so my friend had to block the door to the toilets so no one walked in. 

I visited the restaurant about a year ago and was at the other level and used the ‘accessible’ toilet which was full of chairs and stock which staff had to clear so I could get in. However I can’t say how it is now."
4485,There is no parking outside this bar due to pavement layout and busy road area. There is some limited parking at the rear of the pub but this is mainly for the staff in the shops in this area. The nearest parking is at the Quadrant shopping centre this is a good distance to travel if you have a disability.
4486,The access is from the back of the tower as it gives you level access as you enter you will find the desk to purchase your tickets from. You then go through the bottom level of the tower towards the lifts staff will point you in the right direction for this. You then take the lift to level 5 as you exit you will see a sign telling you the way to go. There are stairs up to the theatre are that you experience the 4D however there is also a wheelchair lift as wheel the type that takes wheelchair user and carer that you hold the button down. There are two lifts up the tower after your 4D experience these are operated by staff. You can move about the first level with a chair however if you want to go higher then it is a spiral stair case and the tower in open air no more class windows
4487,Bus
4488,"Entrance to the shop is great. Doors were propped open, nice wide ramp to enter the shop. Immediately to your left is a seating area if you're not really into shopping - great while you're waiting on friends having a browse! The shop has more upstairs, including a very cool table where you can help yourself to tea and do your own crafting. There is a lift upstairs (with a certain famous painting on the front). The changing rooms are a bit of a treat, however the design does mean they are a little tight for space. Each dressing room is a wardrobe (like Narnia), and each room you step through to is completely unique. One was an aquarium, another a space themed room, then even a luxury toilet themed dressing room...all dreamed up from school children who sent in their drawings which are pinned to the backs of the wardrobe doors. I found the Scottish knick-knack room to have the most space. It's the first on your right as you enter - but the dressing rooms have a very helpful attendant who can recommend the best room if you need a little more space!"
4489,"We parked in the nearby multistorey carpark which was only a few minutes walk away. As the cinema is located in the busy city centre, it may be difficult to find a parking space on the street nearby, but you may be lucky and find one. There is also Buchanan Bus Station across from the cinema and the shopping centre (Buchanan Galleries) has parking too."
4490,"The Post Office is accessible throughout. Outer door entrance of 1170mm, which are always open when the PO is open, and inner automatic sliding doors 1030mm. Doorbell by the entrance. Slight incline up to the entrance. Wide spaces and corridors inside. Standard countertop 1020mm high. Parcel machines are 930mm high. Indoor posting boxes 1260mm and outdoor posting boxes 1260mm high. At kiosk 1 there is a writing ledge 810mm high. Mobile induction hearing loop is available on request, and kiosks 3 & 4 have induction loops. No Braille support. No toilet. Staff have regular disability training. Nearest disabled car park is approximately 200m away. Review posted by Nailsea Disability Initiative."
4491,"The toilet facilities are in the nearby Center from the outside, accessible by ramps and lifts, there was visible fordirection and location. Radar key accessible, with a Euan's Guide red cord card visible. Fully equipped toilet, though as with the vast majority no pegs to hang a jacket of coat."
4492,Easy and good disabled access and parking
4493,"On street parking on Chamber Street, can be slightly limited especially when busy. Best accessed by Lothian Buses - the 35 stops right outside the main entrance to the museum. Lovely wide paths and level entrance into building."
4494,"There are various disabled accessible toilets within the park, however there is not one at the car park meaning that you have to walk into the park first to find this. They are all level access and large, with wide doors making it easy for a wheelchair user and carer(s) to be present. In the Safari Cafe toilet, I noticed a hoist, which is ideal if this is required. However, there is not a hoist present in every toilet facility. The toilets themselves are high, which is beneficial for anybody transferring from a wheelchair to the toilet with assistance. "
4495,"Nearest bus station 3 or 4 minutes walk and plenty of on street parking. Didn't use any transport as staying nearby , but think it wouldn't be a problem at all"
4496,Good pub food and atmosphere
4497,"Riverhouse is under new management and has had a major refurbishment.  It looks stunning! Theres a coffee area, bar area and two restaurant areas. Theres also a large outside seating area which will be lovely in summer. The carpark has 4 disabled parking spaces and flat entrance. It's all on one level inside. Good disabled toilet"
4498,Ramp at front door to help with small step.  Main routes in museum and cafe uncluttered so 'clear runs' in most places with perhaps a few narrow corners in museum.
4499,Access was limited due to work getting done to front of building.  Lift and area around lift had to be cleared for my arrival.
4500,A carpark with disabled parking is located close to the Guildhall.  The local bus station on Foyle Street is a few minutes walk from the Guildhall.  Local buses also stop very close to the building.
4501,"See the opening statement - The access arrangements are not really fit for purpose, I have no way of understanding how someone would fair who is unable to self propel or who is overweight or unfit."
4502,Facilities were very good for disabled guests with reserved parking close to large ground floor bedrooms. Mobility scooters were available. Staff very willing to assist both in craft sessions and in the buffet dining room. Some limitations from historical building layout and narrow corridors. Special diets (gluten free) understood and catered for. Good food and good choice. Too much single use plastic in evidence.
4503,Lots of parking in the Eastgate shopping centre car park.
4504,"From London Marylebone Station it is about a 45 minute journey to Great Missenden. When travelling from London, when you exit the train there is a either a footbridge with no lift to cross or there is a step free slightly uphill path, which is signposted Way Out and with a wheelchair symbol, see photos. I used the step free path, it had continuous hand rails on both sides and it brought me out into the street. From here I turned right onto the pavement and walked down street which had a notable, but not too steep slope, see photo. At the bottom of the hill you turn right onto the High Street, which is flat, and it is the road where the Museum is located. If you require a drop kerb, keep walking along the road until you get to the Cross Keys pub, where there is a step free crossing. The Museum is only 3 - 5 minutes walk from the station and is well sign-posted.

On the way back there is no need to cross the bridge to get on the platform for trains towards London."
4505,The staff were friendly and helpful.
4506,"Because it was wet, the tiled floor was treacherous on crutches. I went flying and was caught by my husband luckily. The flooring isn't non- slip so take extreme care. The location wasn't ideal - through a gate, outside, by a gulley - but I guess the owners have done their best with a very old building."
4507,The Sealife Center at Lodmoor county park Weymouth has disabled access in most of the huts and has 2 disabled toilets and a tight gift shop to negotiate around.
4508,"Currently showing the 'School of Rock' musical - which was excellent - the New London Theatre is in Drury Lane, the heart of Theatre Land.

I was surprised by the limited number of spaces for wheelchair users, however those which were there, had a very good view of the stage."
4509,Ramp to decking. Banister to hold on to. Space inside to manoeuvre.
4510,"Great venue, helpful staff, accessible seats and lift big enough for power chair all bags and carer! "
4511,"During my visit i was assessing how accessible asda in newmains was for disabled access, overall i would conclude that my trip was very good. In the car park there is a number of disabled car parking spaces right next to the shop entrance making it very easy to enter the store. The store is all on one level making this extra accessible for people in wheelchairs or with walking aids etc. There are a few disabled toilets which are also all easily accessed on the ground floor."
4512,"On entering the museum there are three sets of toilets. Very impressed. One for wheelchair users, which is spacious with grab rails and emergency cord. One with a sign on the door with a person with sticks, which has grab rails but no emergency cord. Another toilet door which I didn't check out. Forgot to check when I was in the Thackeray Café whether they had any toilets, accessible or otherwise."
4513,"There are a few entrances to the park. If coming by car, it has its own car park, as you drive towards that there is a (quite small) sign which points you in the direction of separate disabled parking spaces. These spaces are right across from the castle, and you can go along the flattest section of the park from there.

All the parking is free. 

It is not very easy to recognise the disabled parking spaces though,as nearly all of the paint has come off them! Only on one, is there the remains of about half of a 'wheelchair' symbol. A WEE bit overdue a new coat of paint?

Balloch itself can be reached by train or bus, there are also several car parking areas. From the main street there is another entrance to Balloch Park, this isn't far at all from the public transport, but does involve going up a hill if entering the park this way. "
4514,"Reception staff and veterinary staff are all helpful and friendly and welcoming, and I rate the practice very highly. Two stars lost purely for designing such a terrible front door hump and for the really useless doorbell situation mentioned above.  "
4515,"We had a room in the new part. We could choose to have it made up as a double or twin, with or without bed risers. Wet room,  space in bed and bathroom for a hoist."
4516,Great carpark at Towerhill not very big but we had no problem getting a space & managed to get a blue badge one too. Very reasonably priced for London £2.50/hr. I'd definitely use this carpark again. It is recommended on Tower Bridge website as the nearest one. I called the staff for more details & found them  to be very helpful.
4517,Reception staff were excellent
4518,"Parking is tricky - there is limited single yellow line parking on the high street, although there are some disabled parking bays opposite the parliament,  outside the Queens Gallery (and failing that there is a decent car park at the start of Holyrood Park.
A couple of buses go down the Royal Mile."
4519,5 if you have a car as you can park right outside. There is a bus stop nearby and we saw the bus zipping around the island but not sure if it's accessible or how often it runs.
4520,"The star I am providing is for the security staff who were brilliant and told me they get lots of abuse from visitors due to total lack of accessibility when events are on.

There are blue badge spaces but that's it as far as accessibility goes. The dropped kerbs are not dropped kerbs, unless by dropped they mean 1cm less steep than other kerbs. A powerchair will not go up them. To exit the car park in my chair I had to call security and ask them to open a barrier for me. They came out and pushed me up a kerb and apologised at the terrible venue design.

One if the biggest attractions of the macron when events are on is the fact that it is near the UKs biggest shopping park, Middlebrook. There is no accessible route to Middlebrook, just 20 steps. If you want to get from Horwich Parkway train station through the grounds of the Macron and onto Middlebrook, or visit Middlebrook for food while you visit the Macron, then you have a long walk ahead of you. It used up 3 out of 10 power dots on my powerchair travelling into Lostock and all the way around into Middlebrook. It took me half an hour on full speed and involved travelling in the road out of one of the car parks, into oncoming traffic. Absolutely shocking design."
4521,There is park outside the cinema around the corner with lots of disabled spaces. Ok if you're on a scooter or wheelchair but a long walk if you're using sticks.
4522,The café is on the pedestrianised walk way adjacent to the beach front. There are buses that stop near by.
4523,3 disabled spaces next to beer garden/entrance.  Spaces on sloping site so not so good for rear access.
4524,"Based on the currently neglected east side of Birmingham, there is a multi story car pack with lots of disabled parking, (may be challenging for colour blind drivers, as bays and walk ways are marked red for the disabled, blue car parking and green walk ways)"
4525,There is a ramped entrance at the back of the cathedral. The space inside the cathedral itself is limited but it is well worth a visit.
4526,"Every single member of staff, at both ports, were superb.  Even though we hadn't known to book a lift accessible space on board, everyone helped ensure we got one and knew what to do in future without once making us feel like we were inconveniencing them.  They were all helpful and kind and they spoke to me, not my husband about me, and none were condescending.  They made the journey easy and pleasant."
4527,"Accessibility at York train station is excellent and on the level.  The taxi rank is just outside the concourse and car parking is also easily accessed, but is always busy and can be very expensive."
4528,"Having experienced this venue before, I was pleasantly surprised to get in! I had trouble pressing the call bell for help with the lift because there was a bin in the way, but staff moved it immediately. Response to call bell prompt. Space inside quite tight but possible with even a large powered chair. A scooter might be too large, though as lifts aren't very deep. Really lost marks on the PA system, though, I missed over half of what was said. For a comedy show, this was a big fail. Chairs in wine bar lightly padded folding chairs with no arms."
4529,Level access all round. Wheelchair available to borrow at reception. 
4530,The Pier is about half a mile from Eastbourne railway station. There are local buses that stop outside.
4531,"The whole site is easily navigated by wheelchair, Scooter or on foot. A quiet place built by the local priest and people of the community during the years of depression 1920’s and 30’s for people of all faiths and none. "
4532,"Had everything I needed, although it was a little tight inside. I did have to untie the emergency pull cord, but didn't have a Euan's Guide card with me. Missed opportunity there!"
4533,"Not having flown since 2013 I was invited to test the Eagle 2 Lifter at the Virgin Atlantic Base where we met Geraldine who works for Virgin. The holiday came from this and we couldn't ask for a more friendly team of people to plan this for us. Everything went like clockwork and you couldn't ask for a more professional planned trip.
Highly recommend using Virgin for any package holiday."
4534,"Staff were full of suggestions and very helpful, and made the visit really good. "
4535,"There is such a community atmosphere when you visit The Pitt! Vendors will chat to you, organisers will help you, and the lovely folk at the entrance raffle always give a warm welcome. "
4536,"Today we went ice skating and snowing tubing in Leeds City Centre. The staff and there awareness of disabilities was fantastic from booking the ticket and getting a carer in free without asking, to arriving and finding everywhere was accessible to getting on the ice. The staff were more than happy to let Dion where a pair of ice skates and helped push the wheelchair round spinning Dion at every opportunity which he loved. When we needed to make a quick dash to the disabled toilets we had an escorts to open the door and then let us back onto the ice. Dion even had a go on one of the snowmen I thought the man would think I was crazy to let him have a good but was more than happy to help me hold him up. Snow tubing was also fab alot of lifting involved but worth it to see his little face. The overall experience was seemless and I would recommend it for the whole family"
4537,Level access disabled toilet.
4538,Staff were friendly and helpful. Daniel ftom reception brought our stand aid and suitcase up to save me two trips. 
4539,Parking beside entrance
4540,"Everyone is really nice and helpful, but not patronizing."
4541,Cannot fault any of the staff I encountered.  All happy to chat and cheery.
4542,"Some, but not all, stations have wheelchair-accessible toilets."
4543,The entrance fee is £2. There are 4 or so disabled parking bays near the cafe but were impossible to find as the wheelchair sign was on a small post about 1 ft from the floor and very small. Only accessible by car as not near a station.
4544,"Mostly friendly and trying to be accommodating to our various needs, but the table service included interruptions every 15m or so asking if anyone wanted another drink etc. This was to the point of being intrusive from the POV of the half of our table with ASDs. There should have been an opt-out option so we could order drinks at the bar when needed, and not be interrupted constantly. One staff member was clearing plates etc from the shelf under our table. I asked her not to reach over me to do this (she was very near both my stomach and my chair's control panel) and she ignored me and did so anyway which we found very rude. 
On the way out I was following my partner through the crowds in my powerchair, and accidentally bumped into another staff member who walked in front of me. Instead of both apologising to each other because the crowds made it hard to see (which is my general experience of when these things happen), I was given an angry diatribe and accused of doing it on purpose! "
4545,The staff the i intreacted with were friendly and pleasant 
4546,"The Milk Barn is a very family-friendly ice-cream parlour in Falkirk countryside, but be aware that it can be super busy! Unable to book a table, we attempted to visit on a Saturday lunchtime. Pandemonium best describes the experience - which is why I've dropped stars for accessibility. That being said, I'd imagine it would be a nice relaxing place to visit mid-week without the crowds. The ice-cream is excellent."
4547,"unless it has changed drastically since I was there, the toilets are down a flight of stairs and had no accessible toilets at ground level so it is on my boycott list."
4548,This is a zoo that you can visit for an hour or spend the day . Lots of places to sit and eat or enjoy a coffee and easy access all round.
4549,There is ramps
4550,Great access. Step free front door - doors light & easy to use. Single door was wide enough to get through. Easily moveable furniture. Good circulation & space. Only thing was that it was a little on the dark side.
4551,"Limited inside the castle and tearoom v small. Good grounds in the main. Parking ok but gravel paths in some places.
"
4552,"A big Tesco with wheelchair access and trollies that attach to wheelchair. The Tesco had everything I was looking for , including a cafe, home department, clothing department and many more extra services. The staff are lovely and  always helpful and assistance can be requested. This Tesco has good service for the new scan as you shop. Which is great when shopping with someone in a wheelchair. The store also has a lift for easy access to the departments upstairs."
4553,Usual city parking. 
4554,"Signage is clear and readable, and all important areas (reception, bar, toilets) are easy to find. The platform lift looks a bit outdated, but the hotel lift itself works perfectly fine and is right next to reception. Hotel room numbers are easy to find, although village room numbers are a bit more difficult. The Jacuzzi in the swimming pool isn't accessible but the rest of the pool is and they have a hoist to transfer people into the pool. "
4555,"A lot of hoses on the paths. For a wheelchair user, they look like yellow snakes that require some navigation. A wheelchair user will require a carer. 

The noise from overhead aircrafts is simply overwhelming. The noise is relentless and jarring.   "
4556,Balham Railway Station is nearby and has a lift - very accessible for wheelchair users. Balham Tube Station is nearby and is totally INaccessible for wheelchair users.
4557,The staff were really lovely
4558,Very friendly and helpful staff. 
4559,"The beautiful Glass House is the setting for all manner of plants, from tropical to cacti. Despite the buildings age, it is very accessible. With buttons to open doors at each door and ramps, it is easy to explore. There was only one room that I could not access in my power chair and it had a large pond so it was probably better that I couldn’t go in - you are allowed in if you use a manual wheelchair."
4560,"As a bus user there is more than adequate services within the current service restrictions, the services are 11, 16, and 101, these service are all chassis drop, with ramp and double door one at the front, the exit in the middle.You are permitted to exit the front door to exit using the chassis drop. The bus stops southbound 75 meters, northbound 40 meters from the store. There are audio and blind crossing on the road crossings all 20 meters from store."
4561,A wheelchair accessible self catering cottage with amazing views. Good for people with mobility problems too. It had absolutely everything we needed and the owners were extremely helpful and friendly. Secluded and peaceful but in an area where there is plenty to do for anyone with mobility issues. We will definitely return. 
4562,Ramps good but don’t cover all the site.
4563,The Roman Forum is very close to the Metro stop at the Colosseum. There are also plenty of places where a taxi could drop you off near the entrance.
4564,"Staff could not have been more helpful and attentive.....lovely, lovely people! There were full nursing and caring staff as well as physiotherapists and general helpers and catering staff.  Nothing was any bother to them. A lot of volunteers help there too. A good sense of humour was very prevalent among the staff!"
4565,Really helpful. They’ve obviously been very well trained. 
4566,"It’s level access, but if you booked an appointment and needed a seat, but you had a mobility impairment you would struggle."
4567,For the disabled this restaurant is not ideally situated with the only parking space  in nearby municipal car parks about a ten minute walk. 
4568,"The ticket office at the main entrance will give concessions for disabled and carer and there is a flat disabled car park near the top of the castle site.   
"
4569,"Great flat for wheelchair users and a real home from home with everything you could need for a lovely stay. So much provided..2 large tvs one in bedroom  Wifi  Computer  Fridge and Freezer  Dishwasher  Washer/Dryer  Gas Hob Electric Oven  Microwave..Wetroom  Jigsaws  Boardgames  
Cds Dvds....Iron Ironing Board  Hoover a real home from home. So much more offered as in disability equipment if needed. Loved the Scooters available for hire in their own sheds with charging points..and not forgetting Alexa who played tunes for me when i was in the kitchen. Easy access to the flat with a ramp to the door. Peter met us on our arrival and we had lovely chat and he also got in touch when we were leaving making sure we were happy with our stay. Peter always accessible if needed as is Claire the manager...Claire a great asset and easily reached if any problems...Property close to seafront which was nice. I recommend a stay at this property and will be returning ..Thankyou Peter and Claire"
4570,Teas at The Quay.
4571,"Great staff, great venue, great accessible seating, great view, great set up for food & drink... Only downside is the parking."
4572,"There's accessible toilets with visible signage, staffs were helpful in going into the bus, flat pathways around stonehenge and in the buildings"
4573,Easy access from disabled parking spaces near entrance. Fine for quick stop. Food is just basic (eg; toasted sandwich) but I visit someone who lives nearby so i've been a few times.
4574,"The staff in the café were friendly and polite, even when they were busy with customers. They will help wherever they can."
4575,Fully accessible wc with good space and kept immaculately clean.
4576,"All accessible. restaurants, lifts everywhere , lots of glass and viewing areas. Great parking and ramps."
4577,Car park and taxis just outside but not used. 
4578,Level access 
4579,The Adelphi is located just 15 minutes wheel from Waterloo station.
4580,There was a ramp into the reception and a flat exit from the hangar.  
4581,"First thing to note is it's on a fairly steep hill so if you're not using a powerchair it's probably going to be hard work.  It's also very busy with people who are focussed on themselves and not paying too much attention to anyone or anything else.  The surfaces are fairly uneven.  However there is access.  There are lifts, which we have never found to be out of use.  If you enter through the shopping centre at the platform 1 end you have to go right to the other end to get to platform level and then back again (I think this may not be true for 1or 2 of the earlier platforms) which is a very long detour and takes a long time even at a fairly fast walking pace.  You find that different destinations have different platforms so that you don't really need to look up which platform your train will go from just the destnation platform."
4582,"Epsom Station is nearby, fully step-free, equipped with ramps, friendly staff.
There's a large car-park nearby too. "
4583,Friendly and helpful
4584,"The cafe and shop are fully wheelchair accessible, as is the courtyard outside.  There is also a park which has been added to since last time we visited, we didn't actually go in as it was so busy, there did not appear to be any wheelchair accessible equipment but there was a birds nest swing and a sandpit if you are able to lift your child out of their chair."
4585,"The Palace Theatre has one of the most excellent disabled toilets in the whole of Newark in my opinion, there is so much space to move around and they have got a superb sink, which enables me to rinse out my urine bottle after use, please be aware urine is not poured down the sink, the sink is just used to wash it out to try and get rid of any nasty smells!"
4586,Very friendly - seemed to genuinely enjoy serving customers. All looked smart and had branded uniforms also adding to 'time gone by' feel!
4587,Helpful staff in shop and restaurant.
4588,Disabled room on ground floor and there is a door nearby with paving slabs outside. You can park next to the paving.
4589,"Access is completely flat. However I hopped out of my mobility scooter to go inside because it's very small! And has a queue divider to channel people in one direction which makes it more cramped. You could manage with a standard size manual wheelchair I think, for a power chair user it probably depends on your turning circle.

I came to the cafe from Riverside and you have to take quite a long ramp. Or there are steps. My best guess is the ramp rises about 1.5m over a length of 18m or so, but that's purely eyeballing it.

There was no music playing around the site when I was there.

COVID safety wise: I was the only one in the cafe while I was buying, staff member didn't have a mask on, there is outdoor seating."
4590,"Staff were very helpful in many ways. Everything from giving directions, helping with doors, and service during the event meal where I needed a hand to carry things."
4591,"Lift inside requires user to hold button but staff will assist with this.  Access around venue is good.  One part of Museum not accessible as stairs, but alternative route. "
4592,"Easily accessible buy car.  Disabled parking small, unmarked but no issue at our visit."
4593,"Very polite, very helpful and multi-lingual"
4594,"The site is level which is great for the chair, the views are spectacular.  There is a disabled toilet and shower room which is very large. It has a fully accessible shower with shower seat on the wall. There are plenty of grab bars around the room. There is also a thermostat in the room allowing you to make the room warmer if needed. To access disabled facilities you request a key on arrival and hand it back when you leave the site. The staff were really friendly and helpful. Small onsite shop for the essentials too.  Site also allows dogs .Well worth a visit"
4595,"Went on Sunday to see Gyles Brandreth at Huntington Hall in Worcester City Centre. I live close so I went in my power chair. Flat Access on both entrances and flat access to the hall where I transferred to a seat. A large number of people were wearing face masks but some were not. It did ask you to wear it on a sign at the entrance, but some people have their own entitlement.

Half time came and I got back into my chair to go to the toilet, the toilets are upstairs and there was a lift to access. This is where the issues started, I went in forwards into the lift upon arriving at the upper floor there is a tiny space to back out into anybody with a larger chair would not be able to get out onto the space.(I have a foldable power chair for about 3ft by 3ft) I struggled to get my legs out of the lift as not much space behind me to back into. 

I finally managed to get out into the upstairs area and went to find the toilets. I went towards and saw 3 steps up to the toilet, so  looked for another entrance and it was on the other side of the steps where there was a ramp.  This ramp is used for all 3 toilets and as I was going up an entitled lady with a kid came walking down the ramp and insisted she had priority so I back back down the ramp to let her pass. 

On the second attempt I managed to get up the ramp to a door which I entered. Upon entering I was in a enclosed box about 6 foot long and about 4 foot wide. The toilet doors are arranged Infront of me. Ladies on left, disabled Infront and gent's on the right at 90 degree angles to each other.  I was now blocking this whole space with my wheelchair. I opened the disabled toilet and luckily no one was inside the toilet, upon opening the door blocked the exit to the ladies toilet as some ladies were trying to leave. I moved my chair forward into the disabled toilet which was about 4 feet square, just enough to get my wheelchair in and use a hand rail to pull myself up to use the toilet. Again anyone with a larger chair or needs assistance would not be able to fit in there.  The toilet was functional but cramped no turning space inside. Handrails, pull cord and low level sink, honestly I  can't remember if a hot air hand drier in there. 

After using the facilities I had to open the door and back out into the boxed area, again the door blocked the exit of the ladies toilet. I backed out and again I had issues with turning my chair to open the exit door as I have long legs. I opened and went to go down the ramp and back down to the lift area to go back down. As before this is a very tight space and I decided to back myself in when the lift came.  Unfortunately 3 people decided to come up in the lift at that time, there is no space for a wheelchair and 3 people in that area so I then had to re-manoeuvre  my chair  in this tight space and back into the upstairs area to let these people out into it. They remarked that how bad this space area is and thanked me for letting them out. 

Again I went towards the lift and the tight space to manoeuvre the chair back into the lift.  This time I got in backwards without incident but still a very tight squeeze. As before anyone with a larger chair would struggle.

Got back to my seat and transferred  and watched the second half of the show.

My review is yes see shows there, but make sure you go to toilet beforehand. "
4596,"There was an accessible toilet on the ground floor which staff helpfully pointed out. Again if you were in a wheelchair it may be a little snug. They also keep spare high chairs in there. The day I visited it had about 30 helium balloons in it, spares for the tables. So hopefully not a usual occurrence. 
Grab rails present. "
4597,"parking was good, we used the pay and display area opposite the Sennedd building."
4598,Access to old buildings like this multi level ancient mill is always going to be difficult. There are ways for the disabled to access all the public areas but they take a bit of time and need thinking about in advance.
4599,"There is step free access at this attraction. There is a security section where they search bags etc. This area was quiet when we visited but you may have to wait in a queue if it is busier. You then move through to a holding area while you wait for the structure to return to ground level. There are informative boards here as well as activities to keep children entertained, a few seats, a short film and a bar area. It does start to feel quite busy and the seats fill up quite quickly."
4600,I used to take my son to the Sailability sessions every Saturday. The staff are wonderful - very patient and accommodating despite some challenging behaviours. Suitable activities are hard to find for children with special needs - this one is a gem. We'll be going back in the spring.
4601,"This wheelchair accessible maze is perfect for a fun day trip with family or friends of all ages. The Wistow Maze is currently shaped as the famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, in celebration of the novels 130th anniversary.  The maze includes 12 detective themed hidden clues to tackle whilst you explore the maze. 
"
4602,Got here by taxi and home by bus - both worked very well.
4603,"Close bus stop and good parking, but pavements a bit rough and nearest station isn't step free."
4604,4 stars... Except for the result! Disabled access at Murrayfield is excellent - with two provisos... Having to be there so far in advance and also the lift can be extremely tight depending on size of wheelchair...
4605,Plenty of disabled parking spaces right outside.
4606,very easy
4607,"Can't comment on the parking. Don't try to get there by Metro - the nearby stations are not wheelchair accessible. Paris buses all have ramp access. We used a 69 bus to get to the Champ de Mars, from where it is a short wheel or walk to the western end of the promenade. The 63 bus route runs parallel to the walk. Be careful to check on-line whether the bus stop you intend to use is wheelchair accessible. A few are not, including the 69 stop at the Musée d'Orsay. "
4608,Disabled loo easily accessible with grab rails & emergency pull cord. 
4609,"You access the ship via a ramp, overall a very enjoyable experience but no disabled loo on the cruise. "
4610,"The Disney hotels bus service definitely isn't super easy to use due to the fact the staff are not very accommodating. All the buses are now equipped with a ramp and a on board wheelchair space, but actually getting into that space can be difficult if there is a large crowd."
4611,Seemed friendly and happy to be there as there was little trouble.
4612,Disabled parking bay with area of dropped kerb on the street directly outside the restaurant at the end of a row of other parking bays. Large car park at the pier across the road too.
4613,"Disabled loo at former Tissington station - bit grotty but welcome!  If going to Herbert's, they have a lovely one."
4614,"Door is wide but manual. It was quite a heavy door. There was no doorbell to ring for assistance.

I could fit under the table in my wheelchair. The table had a centre post with a large flat circular base. 

There was a lift downstairs however there is very little space to get out of the lift due to things being stored around the lift door. "
4615,"Do not go here.  Especially not alone. There is absolutely nothing for the the disabled. Zero. The streets are cobble stones, entrances have high steps and except for modern buildings, lifts or elevators are hard to come by although some older buildings did install them. For example to reach the Senior Faculty Lounge at Balliol College (a modern room) there are tons of stairs. To see a Shakespearean Play at Merton College, there are uneven ancient steps galore. Its and beautiful city with friendly people and busdrivers but very little for challenged people. N"
4616,"If you enjoy woodland trails then this is an excellent choice especially as the vast majority of the main paths are wide and in good repair. There are many smaller paths which go off but these are not recommended for wheelchair / scooter as they are often narrow and the surface can become muddy. On the main paths you can cover several miles! There is one official car park but no designated disabled bays, also a few unofficial parking areas where access is actually better to main paths. "
4617,"Disabled toilet provided meeting Changing Places criteria. Access by RADAR key, available from staff. "
4618,"Brilliant staff, very helpful. All spoke English very well too."
4619,Huge car park located around the corner with accessible parking spaces. There is also busses and trains that come into Harrogate town centre and pass Valley Gardens. 
4620,"The staff were particularly helpful and enthusiastic. They helped with the doors, gave me a mini tour of the setup for the Forest Fringe and were full of information."
4621,"The door to the accessible toilet is directly off the seating area. The toilet was clean and spacious with grab rails. There is no emergency cord, but I think given location I think if you called out for help you would be easily heard. "
4622,First time traveling on the tube on the 24.11.17 from kings cross to Tower hill. There is 2 access points either using lift in St Pancras International station and there's an access point up the street. Fully accessible to the circle line from street to to train without human intervention train level with platform. On arrival there was a small gap that a manual chair can do fine powerchairs can do it with a little assistance.
4623,There is a large carpark for this attraction especially as Dobbies Garden Centre is right across from it. We managed to park in the bays closest to the entrance.
4624,Very friendly and helpful 
4625,The access was pretty straight forward. The tables were pretty close together but all the floors are very smooth.
4626,Very friendly and helpful.
4627,Staff were friendly and understood my concerns about the accessible toilet and said they would pass them onto the venue owner. Sadly they spent most of the time talking to my PA and not me.
4628,I would think you would need a car to get there. There is a large carpark which has a couple of disabled spaces at the entrance to the spa. 
4629,There are ramps to get in and out of the main building but access is limited to some of the other buildings.
4630,"Before visiting the hotel for a wedding I phoned them to ask about wheelchair access, the staff were not very helpful and said there were stairs, I asked again specifically for information on wheelchair accessibility and was told there was a ramp to get in the conservatory but stairs to the function suites. No assistance was offered and information was limited. I’m a powerchair user but I have a manual chair I can use for short periods of time. There were many obstacles such as no accessible parking, chairs stacked infront of the ramp access door, and tight corners. It is a nice venue and if going on a quiet day for a meal in the conservatory it wouldn’t be too pribl"
4631,Friendly.
4632,Front door on street level right at the bus stop  -easy for a taxi to stop there. 
4633,"There are two disabled toilets, one right outside the cinema and one in the main reception. I think that the disabled toilets are both big and spacious so you have plenty of room to move around. Very good in my opinion."
4634,"I've only been twice since using a powerchair, to see Goldfrapp in concert, so it is very well staffed with stewards and security staff, all of whom are friendly and helpful.  Since the refurb, more thought has been given to disabled visitors and their needs and they almost treat you like a VIP escorting you to your area and the toilet or anywhere else.  There was a steward nearby throughout at the emergency exit who said to to let him know if I wanted anything."
4635,"Automatic doors as you arrive, lifts up to the terminals and staff friendly at the assisted travel. We were meet promptly at the gate to board the flight and on the return journey we were greeted in good time when we landed. We were fast tracked through check in and boarder control which was great!"
4636,"There is an accessible loo situated to the right hand side of the bar area on entering the building away from the main toilets and is always open so no need to have to ask for a key! It is a good size, clean and checked on a regular basis. No shortage of hand rails that's for sure, it is big enough for a chair and a carer if required. There is a pull cord within reach should you need assistance. The tap is also really easy to use if you have weakness in your upper body."
4637,"Euston UNDERGROUND does not have lifts.  I 'walked' from St Pancras.
I found the website difficult and so rang Caledonian Sleeper helpline - they were exceedingly helpful even when I had to change dates."
4638,Good sized accessible loo on the ground floor.
4639,"Gets five stars despite the fact that the wheelchair entrance is quite a heavy door opening outwards - five stars because staff members rushed to open it. Once inside there’s easy ramped access to reception, the lifts, the atrium and the restaurant. The accessible room was spacious with a well-equipped bathroom. Breakfast was very good. The evening menu wasn’t for us but steak lovers will be well satisfied. The staff at reception and in the restaurant could not have been more helpful. The bed was quite high, but we travel with a patient turner and a folding footstool, so wheelchair girl got in and out OK."
4640,"Lots to see & do. There are some amazing animals to see including lions, tiger, rhinos, zebras, elephants etc etc. Most of the park is wheelchair accessible with ramps to viewing areas although some activities such as boat to see chimps and the Flying Fox zip wire are more tricky."
4641,Disabled space in South Silver Street about 100metres to Kfc
4642,"The room we were allocated was lovely with lots of space in the bathroom. The door didnt appear to be wider though for a wheelchair  and knuckles were scraped!
The bathroom had a pull down grab bar on the left hand side but nothing to grab on to at the right which made it quite difficult (really depends on mobility). I wish id taken a photo.
Slatted shower tray and pull down seat. 
As an old hotel really couldn't complain..lifts a little tight but managed ok"
4643,Seemed to be helpful and cheerful - didn't need any specific help.
4644,No problems
4645,"Part of Royal Derby Hospital. Includes Urology Outpatients, Pulvertaft Hand Centre, Head & Neck Outpatients and Eye outpatients.

There is also Medequip, a convenience store and a cafe which shut around 4pm. "
4646,"Helpful, understanding staff, with great attitude.  My requests were met with ease. Space to move, and felt safe. Plus enjoyed the food in a relaxing environment"
4647,The lodge is accessible. Level entry and the patio at the property is accessible via the french doors. We couldn't go too far as lodge at top of hill but if you have transport you could explore. We were happy with the short walk we could manage and relaxing at the lodge. Good wet room and you can borrow a shower chair. 
4648,"There is no parking, disabled or otherwise at the venue but we arrived early enough to park quite close in a side street for free."
4649,There was an accessible portaloo which was basic but reasonably clean with plenty of space and grab rails.  There was no red cord.
4650,Room in the disabled toilet meant I could turn around easily to lock door and to drive out forwards in my manual wheelchair and use the sink and hand drier.
4651,Cleaned daily shower ensuites and larger accessible bathrooms all with access to mobile hoists. Also plenty of extra toilets around the building.
4652,Friendly and helpful.
4653,"You can only really get to this dog park by car as it is located in the middle of the countryside, maybe there’s a bus that goes nearby but I can’t comment on any public transport.

To enter the car park you have to enter a secure gate with a code that you get sent with the confirmation of your booking in a email. The gate is quite big and looks heavy, if you are a wheelchair user I would suggest having someone with you to help open the gate because as well as the heaviness of the gate the ground surface of the car park is difficult to drive on so it would be very difficult to get out and in your car again.

Once you’re in the car park you lock the gate again and then it’s secure to let your dog out. Now I have to say I really struggled to drive my powerchair in the car park as the ground is covered in medium sized stones which you can see in an image below. I had to get my carer to reverse my car as close to the entrance to the dog park as possible so I didn’t have to drive on the stones too much and my wheels were spinning trying to get up my ramp I had to get my carer to put my car at a flatter area."
4654,We mentioned needing access to the rear of the car so were given a spot with plenty of space. In conversation the staff also mentioned that we could have driven down to the water if necessary (there was a short compact gravel path from the activity centre to the water)
4655,"Pretty great! Once you've entered the reception area there is level access to the office on the ground floor. The corridors are well lit and the Euan's Guide office is easily found with it's brightly coloured wall and large logo. There are security and fire doors positioned at regular intervals, these can be stiff and heavy but there are always people around to assist if necessary. On the ground floor there is a cafe serving great coffee with flexible seating options. There are also four meeting rooms on the ground floor which will probably be your destination if you're visiting Euan's Guide!

"
4656,Separate disabled parking area located outside entrance. Slight drawback is that parking in a on gravel surface which may hinder access.
4657,There are many different disabled bays for car parking as well as a fully accessible park and ride bus that runs throughout the day from the car parks to the main visitor’s centre and vis versa. 
4658,"This venue is centrally located and so parking facilities are limited in general. There is a side street where it is possible to park, including spots specifically for disabled parking. Access from the side street and the main road is possible by wheelchair.

Bellgrove train station is the closest to the venue (10 minute walk) but this is not yet accessible by wheelchair."
4659,Very helpful even to the point of offering to carry me up the stairs first time I went when lift was out of order - I declined the offer!!!! 
4660,Helpful staff happy to show things that may be out of reach or view.
4661,Plenty of disabled Parking just outside the front entrance 
4662,"There was a wet room on the ground level with a toilet and there was a separate toilet on this level too. The wet room was very spacious for me to drive around it in my wheelchair. I had to wash my hair in my wheelchair because the it was so warm (don’t worry covered electronics and was totally safe) and there was plenty of room for me and my helper. 

A showerchair was provided for me but, it was a little too big for me to sit in and there was a fold down showerchair attached to the wall. There was a a self cleaning function on the toilet in the wet room but, I didn’t use them. The toilet is positioned in the centre of the wall in the wet room. There is a tracking hoist within the wet room which is separate from the tracking hoist in the bedroom so, you would need to transfer into a chair in the bedroom to then transfer again.

The toilet on the ground level is just the standard size of an accessible toilet. The toilet is closer to the left hand side of the room so, it would be easier for people to transfer at the right hand side.

I do not need the use of an emergency red cord myself because I always need assistance from someone however, I do know about the need for them. The only issue I would say about the toilets at Homelands is that there were no red cords. I don’t know if it’s to make them look more homely and I don’t 100% know if it’s needed but, I’m assuming they are.

On the upper level of the house there was a bathroom. However, a wheelchair user can’t get up to it if they can’t climb stairs which I can’t so, I cannot comment on it."
4663,The ground is fairly rough and you would not be able to access most of the site in a wheelchair. You can get to the visitor centre and the sensory garden but that's about it. Level access throughout the shop and cafe. Plenty of benches for those needing a rest.
4664,Very friendly and helpful
4665,"Excellent tour by a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable guide. Although we opted for the ground level only tour by wheelchair we didn't feel we missed out on anything as everything was so well explained. They even had an ipad with little videos of the things you couldn't see directly as you went around, great idea ! "
4666,Bungalow / drive/garden and conservatory all on the same level so perfect.
4667,"The accessible loos were good once you found them. Although they has the stick out style signs these were not always obvious from a wheelchair height. In the main concourse on the upper level there was one accessible toilet. Once inside the loos were fine with space to move, good grab rails and what you'd expect to find as a wheelchair user."
4668,"Exceptional customer service, extremely friendly, tasty natural juice drinks, I could go on forever. Free wifi, honestly this place is the perfect chill out spot."
4669,Very friendly and helpful staff. Can order what you need at the till and they will collect and take it to the car for you.
4670,Staff are helpful and friendly. It was useful to find out about the Just do more pass which provides discounted rates for those with disability. 
4671,Ideally located a short distance away from Waterloo Station and the Southbank. Just minutes away from the London Eye. Hassle free and accessible throughout. Staff were genuinely friendly and welcoming and were always asking if they could help.
4672,Staff were friendly and helpful. 
4673,The staff are always pleasant and helpful
4674,Access into the Square from adjoining roads is easy with level access and dropped kerbs. The surface is smooth and good for wheeling around.
4675,We caught the bus which was overcrowded due to it being peak season and there was no room for a wheelchair and all the disabled seats were already occupied. The bus stop is five minutes walk (approximately) from the aquarium.  There is a public car park behind the Aquarium approximately 2 minutes walk.  The Aquarium is also located 20 minute walk from the train station you can also catch a bus from outside the train station that drops you a 5 minute walk from the Aquarium .
4676,"The facility is ramped throughout so Annie was independent throughout the whole experience.  Particular nice touches included raised tables in the café so Annie could slot her chair in and not drop food down her front from reaching for her meal (her tartan dress stayed crumb free).  Many of the exhibits are interactive – grab, turn, twist stuff round as well at watch listen and learn experiences."
4677,Disabled parking was available outside the front door of the lodge.
4678,staff are very nice and friendly. They can give information and show you all the way round.
4679,"Publicly accessible loo is located to the left of the main visitor entrance to Holyrood Palace, behind the ticket office and gift shop. It is behind the same door as the gents toilet on the right hand side as you face the palace."
4680,Very friendly and accommodating.
4681,Disabled toilets are available but check with staff that the toilet is not obstructed by furniture.
4682,"Very friendly Staff, Hotel is nice , but a bit old in the rooms, poor access to sockets, accessible rooms OK but a little limited and in need of refurbishment, access to Platinum wing, poor access in bad repair -despite pointing this out on previous stay this has not been changed? are the management listening, usual poorly set out self services making access without assistance difficult. So nice Hotel, little though given to access needs beyond the bare requirements"
4683,"The main entrance is accessed up a long, smooth, relatively shallow ramp, with an automatic door. Inside the reception desk has multiple lowered areas making communicating with staff much easier. Some of the corridors and doorways are narrow but surpass-able with care. The café tables are tightly packed together, and access to the outdoor terrace is down two steps. There is a ramp to the terrace, but it requires going back through reception and round to the back door, and there is a narrow garden gate to get through. Using the lift requires the presence of a staff member, and once upstairs the only way of communicating with the reception staff to go back down is to send a companion down the stairs."
4684,"The staff were friendly and welcoming but did not offer any assistance. This may have been due to their inexperience, I did not feel that they were intentionally ignoring me."
4685,"Toilets are big enough to move around in, no changing place facility but was good enough for our needs"
4686,"There is a reason why this racecourse has a reputation - the location is super, with views of the south downs. The racecourse itself is surprisingly flat. There are lift in all of the stands, the operating of which is overseen by a steward. Everybody willingly opens doors for you, are approachable and sociable. This aids race days as there is always a friendly atmosphere. Each stand have seats designated to wheelchair users. These areas are also overseen by staff. I'd recommend paying for the Richmond Stand as the view over the course from the 1st floor cannot be faulted!"
4687,"The entrances is step free. There is the front door and then a door inside which would cause problems for wheelchairs if you are on your own but the staff can easily spot your outside. With it being quite a small restaurant these doors are needed to keep the wind from blowing in when someone enters. The tables were at a good height.
"
4688,"Beautiful arts and craft house with picturesque gardens near York Race Course. Former home of the Terry family of chocolate fame and now in the care of the National Trust. Tea room, small shop. Step free ground floor and gardens."
4689,Attentive efficient friendly
4690,"The Alternativer Wolf- Und Barenpark Schwarzwald is a wheelchair accessible but precipitous Bear sanctuary featuring Bears, Wolves and Lynxes. There is an accessible loo and a cafe on-site. "
4691,Nice wide step free entrance!
4692,"Having recently replaced the city centre Post Office in St James Centre at the East end of Princes Street, this new Post Office is excellent. It can be found on the upper level of the Princes Mall. You can access it via Princes Street (wheelchair access via the plaza next to Waverley Steps , getting the lift to upper level, or the other entrance is the ramp into Princes Mall on Waverley Bridge."
4693,Staff were helpful and friendly.  Answered well any questions we asked. Disabled empmoyer. The Manager was awesome
4694,As they should be and already fitted with a red cord card.
4695,"While there are no Blue Badge spaces available there is lots of street parking if you want to admire any of the buildings in the village.
Not sure about public transport links however there is a train line that passes the village with trains going to Liverpool information on this should be available on the rail site     
"
4696,"Best hotel I've been to, accessibility wise. Plenty of lifts and nowhere that can be classed as inaccessible. My only real gripe would be the carpet inside of the hotel being very difficult to push on but obviously, there's nothing much that can be done about that."
4697,"I'll start by saying that Spark is a literal stack of shipping containers that they've somehow managed to make fully accessible. Gentrification at it's finest.
The end facing the city centre (north, I think) is the accessible end. There is a slight bump to get onto the patio, which smoothly inclines into the area itself. It has one of those curtains made of plastic strips, but one end is left clear (which I only noticed after struggling through the strands of plastic). Once inside, all of the various stall are accessible from a wheelchair. Some of the counters are slightly high in places.
Unbelievably, there is lift access to the top floor. Sadly the ramp to get on the bottom of the lift is  way too steep for comfort & not for the faint of heart, but once you're up it's fine. It being a platform lift it did rather comically get stuck at the top. Staff were extremely responsive & got me back down within minutes, & were lovely about it all the while I quietly died with embarrassment.  The staff attitude more than made up for the accessibility concerns."
4698,Easy to find. Very good instructions supplied.
4699,"There is parking to the rear of the health centre in a good size car park there are a number of Blue badge spaces indicated with in the car park. If you do park in this car park then you need to get a token to open the barrier to let you out. 
This is to stop people parking in this car park and going to the shops in the area. Health Centre users only to park in the area.
Please note there is also a car park to the side of the health centre this is linked to the retail units in the area and has a 30min time limit if you park in this area you be sent a fine in the post."
4700,"This is the only down side to this restaurant; there is a disabled toilet but it is on the higher level so staff need to take a ramp out for access to it but as already mentioned, staff were only too willing to help in any way they could."
4701,"Through a door which has to be opened manually. It was too far away for me to reach so had to be opened by my carer. Inside, is accessible except if you want access to the books."
4702,"Staff are really friendly, helpful and are  relatively quick."
4703,"Probably the worst part of my visit. The receptionist gave us a code which we were to use for gaining access to the toilet. I didn't really agree with this as it would've been tricky to enter the code on my own. The disabled toilets are in the middle of nowhere. When you get into the toilet you will see that there isn't a red cord! Why, why, why. For example, if I fell inside the toilet am I supposed to scream in the hope someone heard me? Really didn't understand the thought process on this one. First time inside Britain seeing no red cord in a disabled loo. Speechless."
4704,We came by bus. The restaurant is on the corner of Lothian Road and Princes St so there are many bus options and also a tram stop a few minutes walk away. I am unsure about parking.
4705,"Wheelchair accessible although a slight lip at main entrance, but staff happy to help. Plenty of room for wheelchair at table. Staff very friendly and helpful. Lunch delicious , special offers on at lunchtime. Tasty well cooked food. Toilets inaccessible for wheelchair user, no accessible toilet on premises"
4706,"There are 5 parking spaces available at the front door of the church for those who require close access. This was a great help for us so we didn't have to negotiate the cobbles on the path up from the road. They advise that you phone ahead to reserve a space.   
Public transport wise there are numerous buses that stop on George IV bridge,  the only downside being the short hill (and cobbles) to climb up to the front of the church."
4707,"Excellent, very friendly and helpful"
4708,In the past customer service has been a bit slipshod. Tonight the woman staffing it took my complaint form straight up to management. 
4709,"From the mound entrance (ramps), disabled toilet is half way down the main gallery on the left, sharing a door with the gents. Loo is serviceable but small with a short alarm cord and along a short tightish corridor."
4710,Huge and very clean accessible loo (see pic) Have to ask staff for the code.
4711,"The doors are not automatic, are narrow, and have a lip to traverse, but staff are always willing to help if needed."
4712,Very friendly staff. They were in obtrusive but there each weekday if you had questions.
4713,"Friendly, helpful, not intrusively so, a good balance. "
4714,"A great improvement on the old station - light, bright and accessible."
4715,Accessible toilets were available around the aprk
4716,The entrance of the cafe is spacious with double doors and a flat surface allowing safe and easy access into the cafe. As you enter the counter is in-front of you with the main seating area to the right this narrowed the path into the cafe yet it was not inaccessible.
4717,Powerchair had little difficulty using toilet
4718,"Fantastic facility for adults and children.  Open sessions are available with only a £1 charge for a carer.  Siblings encouraged to participate on the child sessions.  Good sizes per groups so not too busy or overwhelming.  Possible to do group bookings so great for parties having exclusive use of the centre.  Small cafe on site but you are welcome to take your own food.  Full hoisting and changing facilities with plenty of disabled parking.  Centre is open 6 days a week and well worth a visit in their words, "" for special people with special needs""."
4719,"I go to Braywick every Thursday to my swimming lessons, and gosh I always get surprise with the amount of facilities available for disable people, it's is really gratifying that the entire building has been designed to meet the needs of literally everybody.
 So if you are looking for a place to go for swimming, gym or even simply a cafe yo should go to Brawick Leisure centre, it is good I guarantee you."
4720,"King's Cross Station is one of London's busiest rail terminuses, which serves local communter lines, the Midlands, North East England and Scotland. It is also connected with the King's Cross/ St Pancras tube station.

I visited on a quiet Sunday morning to see what changes had been made to King's Cross Station. I did not travel that day, these are just my observations about the outside concourse and entrance to the station. Therefore it is not a full review but I hope my comments and photos of an uncrowded station, will be helpful to disabled people who going to the station after shielding/ post lockdown."
4721,"Good loo, well signed, but it would be difficult to access on the scooter, but ok if you can walk a bit.  Room for carer but would be cramped with a wheelchair and a carer."
4722,"Overall, a good experience."
4723,A solid concrete/stone ramp leads up to the main entrance and access throughout the café is easy.
4724,"There's an accessible loo adjacent to the bar, clearly marked. It's kept locked to stop it bring abused but attentive staff happily unlock it. I've used it previously though not on this visit and it wasn't the most luxurious loo I've ever visited but hey there's an accessible loo!"
4725,"No ramp required, flat, consistent surface"
4726,"I decided to give to a four star rating as I was able to get around and indeed find my way around. There were some spots where the paths went wheelchair friendly but there was enough to do and see. Having a ramp up into the Glasshouse to explore the plants was great!

I think my word of caution is simply that there is a lot of walking as it is a big park! That’s said there were;laces to sit and you could pop in the cafe for a break. We particularly liked some of the surprise elements ... wheeling up on to the bridge and looking down at the path we’d walked along was fun ... discovering the old steam engine was a surprise and a spot for a selfie!

You could also visit many of the buildings in the park like the Glen Pavilion, the Peaock (food and drink) or the Pittencrief House Museum; all of which had ramped access."
4727,Easy on the flat access. I managed fine with my two sticks to get in and out the doorway.
4728,Generall found the toilets to be a bit grubby
4729,"Friendly and helpful, directed me to disabled toilet"
4730,"The Spanish Barn is a separate building to the main museum. It has level access and the cobble stones in front of the door, have been smoothed down and not pronounced. Inside there for the events I attended there were free standing chairs. The barn is on ground floor level throughout and is step free. the stage area for the speakers had both steps and a ramp, so was fully accessible. Leaving the Spanish Barn, you can go through an archway to the cafe. It has outdoor seating with free standing tables and chairs and unobstructed views down to the sea front. The cafe is small. The door was open when I arrived. It has free standing tables and chairs. There is a standing height counter where you order your food. 

On this visit I did not go into the museum or gardens."
4731,Helpful and friendly.
4732,Disabled toilets on various floors. Lifts okay. Disabled access doors.
4733,there are no access problems at cambushinnie croft.
4734,Disabled Bays up to Reception
4735,Attentive and made sure I knew where I was going. They guided me to an accessible check out lane. Some lanes have a plastic screen which makes them difficult to go through but some at the edges have no screen so wheelchair users can pass. All staff that I could see were wearing gloves and maintained social distance. When I handed my basket back to a kind woman at the tills she immediately wiped it down and people were cleaning after every customer. There was also plastic guards at checkouts between me and the till staff. No cash payments were allowed only card which I was fine with.
4736,Wheelchair access is reasonable. Doors are electric and automatic and there is a small lift which is how you access the shop floor. There are trolleys that fit on some wheelchairs and disabled child trolleys. There are mobility scooters and manual wheelchairs available. There is two seats downstairs and some seats near lift upstairs but no other seating. Lights are bright. Shelves are high. Freezers are both deep chest types and freezer with doors above which are difficult to access. Sandwiches and drink fridges had doors. Downstairs there was a wheelchair accessible photo booth.  
4737,"Very spacious area within the cathedral no problems manoeuvring unless its a peak time and very busy. But there is lots of room for wheelchairs. 

Absolutely beautiful building worth taking time about to admire the architecture.

Tour guide is also available to show you around and to provide you with any assistance you many need, just need ask.

Only negative is there is no wheelchair access to individuals wanting to get to the top of the minster to look over the city."
4738,"Easy access, with a lift to every level, though on one floor you need to use a stair lift, and this is only at one end so you need to go back to it.  Every other floor you can go right round the level.

The lift is not big enough to turn in, so you need to back in or back out of it."
4739,"We only met one very pleasant young man, Gareth, but he was so helpful and willing. 
Thank you for your support to us."
4740,"You have to use a car to get there and plan well. Once you get to the end of a narrow country lane, there are two options; a lane to a discrete car park that has a number of disabled parking spaces or the top of that lane that lead to another car park space which has no disabled parking. My carer and I chose the latter option because we wanted to meet up with able bodied friends and have a picnic under the shade of the trees in that car park. Ample spaces to permit this and not charged for parking in this car park. P.s. I did not take up an additional parking space. "
4741,From either entrance it is easily accessible from the center of Disley.
4742,"They have done their very best - sheer geography means that the sloping gardens between the house and the Tweed could not be made wheelchair accessible, but the house is (other than a couple of steps up to the chapel) and the two walled gardens have been unobtrusively altered to make wheelchair exploration possible. The Visitor Centre has a lift connecting the ground floor with the restaurant, which is on the first floor. The door connecting the shop with the gardens isn't automatic, but staff were very helpful."
4743,"Accessible parking nearby followed by kerb-free, step-free access, automatic doors and smooth, smooth floors to wheel on. Great toilets with vertical and horizontal handles. One of the toilets had a changing table. Half a star lost for the mirrors not being low enough for a wheelchair user to look in, but apart from that."
4744,"I was pleased to find an accessible ensuite bedroom at such a reasonable price in Alnwick, and I'd go to Alnwick Youth Hostel again, but I hope they've got plans to perk up the room."
4745,I thought some of you might like to know that the Prior John has recently had a refit. It has level access a wide corridor around the bar and a changing rooms toilet. And you can order and pay via an app on your phone so don't even need to go to the bar. 
4746,"Disabled loo on the ground floor, clearly signed on the door, but I had to ask to find it on the first attempt. It has plenty of space, grab rails and a lower level washbasin. Good hot water and paper towels. It is always beautifully clean and sweet smelling."
4747,The double doors (two sets in quick succession) at the entrance are the main drawback.  A wheelchair needs both doors open to fit through. There's another door into the bar but this has been propped open on each visit - this one is quite wide.  Floors are carpeted but it's a short pile and relatively easy to wheel on. The entrance hall was tiled. The way through the eating area might be tight if it's busy but it hasn't been a problem on both our visits.  There was room to manoeuvre a wheelchair in the bar.
4748,"No steps, flat surfaces on each level and lift available."
4749,"Many places use the fact that they are within a listed building as an excuse however the Scotch Whisky Experience have gone above and beyond to make this beautiful building fully accessible. The first part of the tour involves you going into a whisky barrel and travelling through the process of whisky making. There is one barrel each tour that is accessible for wheelchair user and one of the companions. This barrel slips of the rules to the side and a small list takes the wheelchair user to the barrel and all you have to do is reverse in, it's that simple.
The next part of the tour takes you to a cinematic room where you learn about the whiskys in different regions of Scotland and you have a rub and sniff card to give you an idea of the ingredients and the scents that you may pick up if you try one of these whiskys.
You then go into a room that has a square table and talk more about the regional whiskys. This is where you get to pick the whiskey he would like to try based on all the knowledge of picked up through tour. The staff kindly pour this for you into a delightful little glass, which is a gift to you from them, and then you go into another room filled wall-to-wall with bottles of historic and beautiful coloured whiskeys from through the ages.
This is where the staff teach you how to appreciate the whisky you have been given, from the scent to the taste.
The whole experience is one I would highly recommend for anyone who is visiting Scotland or if you're from Edinburgh, it is well worth a visit."
4750,"Good signage to the museum, wide and easy ramped access and automatic doors at the Maritime Museum.
Access to Old Dock is about 4 -500yds from the Museum under the shopping centre , Liverpool One and is not open to the public  except with escorted tours. Easy access, using a lift and then for wheelchairs , a very good , robust platform lift which takes you down 2 flights of stairs. You can access the platforms around the Old Dock as easily as anyone able bodied."
4751,We travelled to the gallery on the free Wakefield bus that is wheelchair accessible. There is a bus stop very close to the gallery. 
4752,"The main entrance has a revolving door, which can be difficult for most people, but especially for disabled visitors. There is an assisted accessible door to the left of the main door, but as there is a slight incline, it can difficult if someone is taking in a sports chair with them etc. Once in the centre, the tiled flooring is extremely smooth and easy to move around on."
4753,"Within the site, access with a wheelchair was easy - the worst was the paving outside the entrance/exit. Not suitable for mobility scooters because of narrowish paths and sharp corners. A couple of Small steps into buildings (eg the model train layout) but not insurmountable. Plenty of seats and picnic areas."
4754,Never disappoints. Only loses a point for the heavy door to the loos.
4755,"We have visited this venue in previous years and the really good news is that a fantastic new permanent ramp and a lift have been put in. However, there needs to  be more awareness. We  were going to a show in the celllar and were taken to the locked door that leads to the lift. The member of staff was helpful but didnt know the code to the door and disappeared for what seemed ages, to find it. We eventually got to the lift and down to the celllar. However, a lot of equipment and boxes had been left oppostie the lift door making it very difficult for the wheelchair to get out. 

It is a shame to make such a good investment in making the venue accessible but not give the appropriate training to staff. 
"
4756,Good buses 12 and 16 and the bottom of Leith Walk is about a 4 minute walk.
4757,"See body of review.  We caught a bus, then walked.  It wasn't a long walk, but difficult terrain, especially in the tightly packed crowds.    We left just before the end in order to get downhill and avoid said crowds, thus making the walking easier for me."
4758,There is an accessible toilet but I didn't use it.
4759,"Seeing the main changing room was up a flight of steps, I was ready to leave. Then we noticed an upstairs, then we saw the lift. So we asked was there level access to fitting rooms upstairs - yes.  But actually there's an extra large cubicle with two grab rails and enough room for wheelchair. Staff member was happy for husband to come in with me to help and offered to assist if we called her."
4760,"This Lodge wasn’t in Lochmaddy but that is the nearest village. It is not far away & is day to find & we’ll sign posted. It is on single track road, don’t be alarmed it is well worth the narrow road there. There were chips on the car parking area but my husband took the car into the front door on the level stone slabs so it was easy to transfer & move into my wheelchair. "
4761,"Signage is a bit small, but for wheelchair access with no additional needs, it's quite good. There are signed performances and audio described performances available, and assistance dogs are welcome but I've not experienced these myself. The website says infrared hearing necklaces are available on request. "
4762,Tight for space but accessible for most wheelchairs. No changing place or anything like that.
4763,"Our hotel, Hotel Cala Galdana, had fantastic staff who were all friendly, happy and helpful.
As did everywhere that we visited in the resort. It really was a pleasure to be there. "
4764,"We went as a work night out - a big party of about 12 which included 3 powerchair users and a manual wheelchair user. This was no problem at all, the table which we were seated at had loads of space. The staff were absolutely brilliant (including the complimentary Prosecco!). The accessible loo as clean and spacious. Overall an amazing experience and some of our party have already been back (several times)!

A great place to go for a pizza before the cinema or in a convenient location for lots of other activities too. 

And really really delicious food - my pizza was just sublime! Certainly gives other pizza places a run for their money! There is a really extensive menu - nearly too much to choose from!"
4765,"I was impressed by the access and the helpfulness of the staff when I raised a couple of small issues that would make the experience even better for wheelchair users. The entrance doors were automated and and I had the option to use one of two available platform lifts to get up to the main public level of the building. Getting around the exhibition space was easy and I could see and enjoy the displays. The cafe area was easily accessible, as was the shop, the information desk, and the Reader Registration desk."
4766,"Level access to wide door wet room with grab rails and flip down shower seat. On request, a self propelling shower chair/commode. Moveable hoist hire, pool hoist"
4767,"Staff and volunteers all friendly, full of information."
4768,"This establishment is set in the grounds of Fakenham Farm, a small working farm, although run as an independent venture. I contacted the establishment a few days before visiting to check wheelchair accessibility and was assured that there was full wheelchair access and a disabled toilet. On this basis I decided to visit only to find that wheelchair access is very poor, the disabled toilet is not fit for purpose and, perhaps worse of all, the proprietor's attitude was appalling"
4769,Staff were helpful when asked where the disabled changing rooms were 
4770,There are plenty of staff available to show you the accessible route. The audio guide is easy to use with useful short descriptions of each room and what is on display. The rooms open to the public are accessible as is the outside covered café. If you wish to go on a garden tour there is an accessible buggy to take you around the grounds (book separately). There is also a shop which is accessible and you just need to ask the staff to let you into the side entrance. See photo of café and ramps
4771,"Queen’s Court is very close to the train station and about ½ mile from the bus station. There are bus stops right outside, as well as taxi drop off point. Car parking can be limited nearby. The paving slabs are a little uneven, and the hill is quite steep, but there are proper crossing which makes getting there as a pedestrian nice and easy."
4772,"No toilet not much room to move, step at entrance "
4773,There wasn't anyone at reception but there is staff around to help.
4774,There is a small car park although being somewhat out of the way driving to this venue may be the only option.
4775,Wheelchair access to the venue is via Killermont Street. You have to get two separate  lifts to get to the main concert hall. The second one was not well sign posted and quite a distance away but there were lots of ushers on hand to direct us and impressed that there was a dedicated usher in the second lift to ensure it was used by people who needed it. 
4776,"In Hall toilets poorly maintained, door latches faulty, emergency cord too short. I have used the disabled toilets on the concourse/atrium level before and they are above parr. This weekend I was there as a volunteer fundraiser for a charity, so, yep I got in free. Partway through the day, I needed the loo so went to the closest, which was in the Hall, 8 I think. The first door I tried was unlocked. Unfortunately, it was occupied, due to the fact that the latch was obviously broken. The 1 next door was free, though its latch was only a little more secure, a strong pull on the door and someone would be scarred for life seeing me on the loo! The emergency cord was far too short, not tied up, just short. Very little space which gave me a lot of trouble getting out. Fortunately, there were some staff on hand to hold the door open for me.
When it came time to go home, I called the private hire firm who had dropped me off, only to be told that I would have to make my way, via Bus or pavement to an out of the way pick up point by the carparks. The reason, Black Cab Monopoly! If I had given in, and gone by Black Cab, the roughly 4 mile journey, on past experience, would have cost me between £25 and £30. The private hire fare, £7.50, with drivers I trust and actually know where I live! Sorry, outside London, with Black Cabs, forget the Knowledge, more satnav and ""do you know the way?""
When I went back in to ask NEC staff, I was told about the buses that went to a couple of the respective carparks, they couldn't tell me which went near the pick up point or guarantee that I could access a bus in my wheelchair! They then directed me to the event security. When I explained my situation, their first response was "" What, in a f****ng wheelchair?!? Are they mad!"" 4 of them tried to work out a way I could get through the Halls. Fortunately, my booked driver then called me and said that they had let him through to pick me up at the closest point. So after 30 minutes plus, common sense prevailed.
The staff where very good, the maintenance and procedures, dire to the extreme."
4777,"I loved this museum and wish I could've stayed longer. Very informative, accessible for myself and well laid out. My ticket was about 15 euros."
4778,We arrived by ships tender. There is a car park close by. The railway station is just above the Marina but Villefranche is very hilly with lots of steps. 
4779,Flat level entrance
4780,5 minute walk from Exchange Square. Several accessible bays in street outside. 
4781,I parked outside the city centre and got a trolley bus to the waterside. The trolley bus has a lift and very friendly and helpful drivers. 
4782,Lovely bathroom and loo arrangement. Everything I needed
4783,Parking Bay available right next to the pathway that leads to the restaurant.
4784,"Wide aisles, automatic door, new loos. Level."
4785,"I'd been on to venue staff before the tickets went on sale and from then to the end of the gig  they were very helpful.

However I docked half a point for one guy. The guy who advised me not to be in the standing area did so to my friend. Tut tut. There's nothing wrong with my understanding or hearing,  man. 

This was my only tiny negative experience the entire time. "
4786,"Level access to the inside of the cafe, we preferred to sit outside"
4787,"I got the train to Queen Street and walked down, 5 minutes maximum. Plenty of buses also pass the restaurant and parking is available at george square and surrounding areas. "
4788,There is a small stipend cleared this with my wheelchair.
4789,"There was an accessible toilet in the building, toilets were clean and tidy. "
4790,"There are automatic doors at the front that allow easy access for wheelchair users. The cinema is located on the second floor of the Omni Centre. There's a lift in the centre of the foyer for anyone who can't use the escalator.

The building operates on a one-way system, with your path clearly marked by large arrow signs on the floor. The doors inside the cinema are a little heavy and might be difficult to move for if you don’t have two hands free. 

Hand sanitizer is available on both floors, and the dispensers are all automatic. They are relatively high up and might be difficult for some visitors to reach. The cinema has disabled seats and lighting along the floor to guide you to your seat. Due to social distancing precautions, seats are spaced out, limiting the number of people per screening. I recommend booking online well in advance due to the limited number of seats. 
"
4791,"Loved it, a great experience all round."
4792,They met me outside the train station and picked me up at Pittodrie Stadium.
4793,"Access is good. Level into the building, although a wheelchair user might need a hand with the doors if on their own."
4794,Parking in crouch end can be busy but there are bays right outside.
4795,A short walk from Vauxhall station and on numerous bus routes. Blue badge parking is available to pre book.
4796,I often visit the Mill Centre with my Gran who uses walking aids and often a mobility scooter or a wheelchair. This allowed me to see how accessible the centre was for those who need more space and specific entry requirements.
4797,Superb service from the staff. As we would have difficulty going up to order and managing the self service drinks machine staff quickly provided table service. Checking during the course of the meal to make sure we were OK. Couldn't have been more attentive!
4798,There is almost flat access with just a tiny lip at the door. The dining tables are the right height to enable a wheelchair to fit underneath comfortably. There are smaller tables at the front of the restaurant for patrons stopping by for coffee and several outside. There are 2 areas with sofas and low coffee tables not suitable for use from a wheelchair.
4799,"Bus stop just at the door. Parking free in side streets and outside, Blue Badge etc"
4800,The castle is all cobbled . It's been made as accessible as possible.
4801,"Am old Victorian Pier it is clear from the outside that the Pier has some age to it once through the doors however you enter a modern world with a range of games machines and fruit machines with lots of flashing lights and noise. You have to go through this area to access the pier area its self which out via wide double doors at the back of this area as you might expect this can be a bit of a bumpy experience if you are in a wheelchair as the wooden flooring is not completely level once outside on the pier you will find a Crazy Golf course the hole represent places of interest around the area and a small café that we did not visit.  There was also an area that was roped off and you could see that the shop in this section was in need of repair.
However if you want good views of the beach etc. then this is the place to go.
  "
4802,"Plenty of nearby public transport with good access.  The friendly MerseyRail service is a firm favourite for me. Only thing I really don't like is the lack of tarmac to get in, being the old docks area they do like their cobblestones!"
4803,Polite and helpful. Weren't astonished to see a disabled person paying for things!
4804,"The hotel had a very nice health club, beautifully decorated, with modern facilities to help you improve your own health. 
Let’s show you around then

OUR REVIEW
We begin with giving you details about the disabled bedrooms, as this is a hotel we 
recommend you staying at when in the area around WEYBRIDGE and Ascot.
Having parked the car, and registered your car number plate at the reception desk, 
(photo 1) and if staying here, book in now.
Take the lift up to your floor number, and a small corridor will lead you to your room (photo 2) and the room we reviewed turned out to be huge (3) with a very good size and comfortable looking bed (4) The bathroom was very modern, spotlessly clean, lots of room in there, and a walk in shower (5) and if needed a connecting door to next room is available, ideal if you have children, or your carer needs to be close to you (6) and if not needed, there is plenty of space to store the wheelchair, and move around the room.

Now we need to check out the health club.
First of all, down on ground floor by reception desk, a small passage lies over to the left for the door into the Gym (photo 7) which is just off the lovely looking corridor (8) and inside you will have the use of the very modern and up to date equipment needed for your exercise this morning (9).
Now take the lift up to second floor (10) and you will see the entry into the health club (11) and up to its reception desk (12) where you will book in for your treatments today. There is plenty of space to move your wheelchair around (13) in this delightful club, with lots of various seating areas (14) and and you will be escorted along a pleasantly furnished corridor (15) to the changing room, if needed (16) depending on what you choose to do today. All the rooms are delightful and different, with up to date facilities (17) such as the heated rooms provided for different treatments, all modern and very clean (18) and then you can settle in to the heated loungers that will help you with any ailment you need support with (19) and then to help you cool off again, with a cup of coffee or perhaps a healthy alternative, why not sit out on the deck in the lounger while watching the racing cars race past you (20).
All in all a wonderful health club will make your visit most enjoyable.

OUR FINAL THOUGHTS.
This review is to help provide our thoughts about staying here overnight and to enjoy their health club facilities, but to see hotel at its best, read our first review for Brooklands hotel.
We certainly recommend you considering this lovely modern hotel and its health club, where we know you will be well looked after."
4805,I attended the 'Dear Europe' event organised by the National Theatre of Scotland on the day that we were supposed to Brexit.  It was a mix of celebration and sadness of cultures and identities and views about the possible future for all of us and what it could hold.  The venue was perfect for this event as it encapsulated changing identities; it was a huge old warehouse space transformed into an events space with several screens.  I absolutely loved all of the performances but especially the multi-sensory 'Death Becomes Us' and 'Moving Through Shadows' 'Cadaver Police' and 'Second Citizen'.  Staff were very welcoming and helpful both inside and outside the venue and I was made to feel just as much a part of the audience as everyone else free to immerse myself in the brilliant performances. There was also an adjacent bar (Acid Bar) which had a disabled toilet and a private car park with plenty of room was made available for us.
4806,"make it easy to get help if needed, very experienced at working with people with different needs"
4807,"Accessed through a swing door from the deli, there's plenty of space in the toilet with plenty of room for a carer. There are grab rails & it's well set up."
4808,Very helpful with the access
4809,Visiting castles is always a bit of a tricky affair as a visually impaired person. Stirling didn't disappoint as there was lots to see and explore. Once you have a sense of what there is to see and what is where visiting becomes easier. The top tip would be to take one of the free tours as it brings the visit to life.
4810,"An arts centre which offers a wide range of activities; arts & crafts, music (jazz, classical etc) & so on. It is very easiy accessed, with no steps & lift access to the first floor. My review does not include the adjacent Wilde Theatre. The centre is located in  extensive park land, which has good paths."
4811,"The accessible loo had everything I needed, with plenty space and grab-rails etc. As you can see from the picture provided, the red pull cord wasn't tied up, but it didn't reach all the way to the floor either. The locking mechanism could be a challenge if you have reduced hand function, but I managed it well enough."
4812,"Totally accessible ground floor toilet, next door to bedroom, not far from living room. Rails around toilet, I think the toilet was a normal height, we used a shower commode chair over the toilet as it was a better height, but I believe a toilet raiser is available. Plenty of room for two carers to assist"
4813,"There are a number of steps at the reception door, and you will need someone to go inside to reception desks to ask for help in putting down a ramp for you, but they are all so helpful and it will be quickly done for you.
Inside, everything you will need is on the level, on the ground floor. There is no lift for you, but if you wish to have an overnight room, please book number 1 bedroom, it’s a delight, and it’s on the ground floor, and large enough for you, although a few 
bits of furniture may have to be temporally moved to allow your chair to get to the bedroom door to start with. (see photo 9 on part three)
The walk-in bathroom is truly lovely, with lots of room to move inside."
4814,No doorbell and quite heavy door.  Quite narrow inside and very busy.  Staff friendly and helpful.
4815,"Staff very friendly and helpful, as mentioned they are all volunteers. I was meeting my niece there, so the minute I entered the building, I was approached by Barbara to see if I needed any assistance. I was offered help throughout ( my niece had her hands full with a baby and a pram) I was offered help to go around the house and gardens, but we managed on our own. Staff regularly checked that we were all right, whilst we were exploring."
4816,Staff were very helpful and friendly.
4817,Welcomed to the premises. Very friendly. We were given a table and the chair was taken away to  accomadate my wheelchair . Meal was ordered and everything arrived promptly arrived and was delicious. Great  service and even had decaf tea.
4818,All staff were helpful each time and happy to assist.
4819,Staff always seem helpful and happy to help
4820,accessible italian restaurant - opposite rear entrance to bristol hippodrome which is opened for disabled access to theatre - used by all customers - not just those going to theatre - great food - lovely wine and accessible for wheelchair users etc - disabled loo available
4821,Car park is massive but busy
4822,There was accessible parking but it was quite a trek from door. I didn't see any bays close by.
4823,"After a few visits, the staff become friends and that's a great credit to them. Sadly we can't give massive tips!"
4824,"Lots of level access.
two lifts
No automatic doors in corridors"
4825,Cafe Kisa is set just behind the main street in Perth. It's always very busy so I would recommend booking. It's mostly on one level but we said we had a wheelchair when we booked.  My husband dropped me off outside. Level entrance. We had a lovely lunch with some cocktails.
4826,Torquay Train Station is a 10 minutes walk away and buses stop close by along the sea front.
4827,Very helpful and friendly. They got very involved with the children/ adults. 
4828,Staff could not have been more helpful.
4829,Helpful staff. No complaints
4830,Plenty of parking outside with a good number of disabled parking bays.  There is a bus stop located nearby but couldn't say how frequent the service was.
4831,"The hotel does not have its own dedicated parking but is very close to the car parking facilities at Waverley Railway Station. 

For me the proximity to Waverley was welcome as I use public transport, being visually impaired."
4832,Incredibly helpful
4833,There are two staff on reception who can provide information and assistance. They have always been really helpful and friendly. They go the extra mile to help others especially with accessibility issues
4834,"There are two disabled toilets on each floor of the museum, which are clearly marked. The toilets are spacious and offer support aids and changing facilities, as well as emergency pull cords."
4835,"On site parking, free to visitors"
4836,"The nearest disabled parking is alongside hotel, but it on a first come first saved basis, and if full, you would need to find another car park, and although not to far away, it’s a nuisance, so bear this in mind.  It’s £10 a night at the moment."
4837,There's a small car park outside and a disabled parking bay was available when we arrived. I'm not sure how busy this gets at peak times. The pub is not particularly close to public transport routes that I'm aware of. I believe the 217 is the only bus which comes close which is not very frequent. 
4838,Toilet was very spacious.
4839,Good food in an accessible Cardiff Bay restaurant
4840,"We really couldn't have hoped for more. The most exquisite location. Close enough to town to enjoy the tea shops and pubs, but quite enough to feel you've escaped to the country. The accommodation was brilliant, with great attention to detail, especially for our mobility impaired 92 year old Nan, while not forgoing any luxury. We truly felt at home and Ann and Gordon's hospitality was beyond our expectations. The locals were also very welcoming and we were able to hire a wheelchair in Buxton that made life just so much easier and enjoyable. I really can't rave about this accommodation enough. We are super thankful for our 10 day stay. Totally relaxing family bonding holiday. "
4841,"This is a small French Cafe in The Bruntsfield area of Edinburgh and their range of breads, bakes and cakes are made daily in their bakery shop, further down Bruntsfield at Whitehouse Loan. I understand they also have an outlet in Stockbridge in Edinburgh. The staff are  -  French , providing excellent service. In addition to the eating side of things they have a fine selection of coffees, white and black teas. They do a lot of takeaway business given the pastry selection. Inside there are 6 tables with 2 chairs, they removed a table and chair to allow Rhona Access with her mobility trolly, then stored it for her. The toilet is small but manageable for a wheelchair.
Front door access and throughout is on street level. There are2 tables and chairs available outside the cafe. The north bound bus stop to the city is right outside the front door, with 11, 15, 16, 23, 36, 45 and 101 all having disabled access spaces, the same services call on the other side of the road going south. There is ample parking in the area and it’s on a very busy street and route out of the city. As one should expect the food is authentic and fantastic."
4842,There are two disabled toilets in the whole school
4843,Grab rails at the toilet but a bath
4844,There is a full changing places size toilet available with height adjustable shower stretcher/changing bench as well as shower and toilet. There are also additional disabled toilet facilities - the place is new. clean and well organised
4845,"It's quite poor. More clear signs needed. Height of till and drinks area is too high. No sign of a loop system for McDonald's area. No sign of anything in brill. Bad seating arrangements, no room at all and some seats are screwed down. Staff need more training in general and politeness. Toilet is too far away and no sign for it. "
4846,Automatic doors throughout the buildings and a lift to the 1st floor
4847,A few facilities in the different parts of town but always in use 
4848,"Perfect. Well laid out with a wet room, easily navigable in a wheelchair with plenty of adaptive assistance items available if needed. "
4849,It's a funky quirky building - and the disabled access follows that theme! Don't be put off by the steps at the front of the building - the main accessible entrance is around the side. Our show was in one of the rooms on the Ground Floor - which we accessed easily from the Courtyard. The Courtyard houses several bars and food outlets during festival time - but although busy it was fairly easy to navigate. 
4850,"The main trails are very good for using with a powerchair. Those which might be too steep are highlighted in the trail booklet and on signs. The numbering system could be better and we recommended they use colour coding. The staff were receptive to suggestions, well informed, friendly and happy.
The shop and cafe are first rate and easy to negotiate (room for many cyclists, walkers and my powerchair).  We had some excellent food served by friendly, happy people. The toilet was easy to negotiate, clean and spacious - no nonsense.
The views over Derwentwater are fantastic and we loved hearing the wind through the treetops."
4851,"The bus stop by the East Gate is really handy as there's only a short walk to the entrance. If you come by car then the West Gate, John Hope Gateway, is probably better as there are some accessible parking bays but these do get busy."
4852,"After tackling the doors, inside there is much space for manoeuvre  around the tables."
4853,"Easy parking for Disabled, Wheel chairs user can park outside as well as park in lower car park and get a buggy to the location. Staff are really helpful. Staff are an asset to the hospital and make it one of the most outstanding hospitals in the NHS portfolio"
4854,This was really accessible and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. 
4855,These seemed fine
4856,"Large accessible Chinese restaurants but toilet facilities could certainly do with being refreshed and cleaned

Friendly staff, Good Food, Level access from somewhat uneven tarmac car park. Plenty of room between tables"
4857,"There is free disabled parking outside of gym. 

I came from Derby and the bus stop was located quite a walk away from the gym across a busy road. "
4858,"The station is large so if you're mobility impaired you may struggle. 

There were ramps available for the trains and also lifts. 

There was seating at regular intervals around the station. There were also transport wheelchairs available. 

Train time displays were high up and were orange light up text. The print wasn't large. Some of the signs had larger print than others usually white bold print on a dark blue background. 

Platforms 13/14 didn't appear to have tactile paving at the platform edge. Other platforms had the tactile paving. "
4859,There is a few disabled parking spaces by the rugby pitches and which are near the entrance to woodland paths. The car park has a lot of potholes and it is rather gravely. 
4860,It is a fantastic location and a lovely landmark for the quaint town of Galway.
4861,"Staff are usually helpful if a little slow to recognise when & what is needed, and are friendly if at times blunt."
4862,The only disappointment for us was the bathroom in our room. The shower is level and so you can roll in but it was tricky for us as it was tight to be in there with a carer. It was also quite tight getting past the bath to the shower. A wet room would be much easier and make the experience a lot better.
4863,Staff were very welcoming welcoming and friendly
4864,Each property has a parking space
4865,"The Attic is on the seafront in Southend. Not far from the old gasworks car park, and good but pay as you use parking bays to the front of the Cafe ( you can get an app for your device so you can top-up payments and the app sends you text messages reminders when your paid time is going to run out ). 

The Cafe is light and airy, with tables down one side and a sofa and chairs on the right as you enter. Lots of space for a wheelchair, and a good accessible loo to the back of the Cafe. Very helpful and friendly staff, but not over the top. The range of hot drinks, soft drinks, and food is very good. The Cafe is used by various local groups to hold meetings due to its good access and helpful staff. Be it Scope, or a learning disability monthly hub meeting. Well worth a visit, and say hi to Kath, she is the boss lady."
4866,I got there on my mobility scooter.  There isn't dedicated parking but there is a bus stop just outside and on-street parking.
4867,"There's only street parking or multistory car parking, which can be a problem if you have a large wheelchair accessible vehicle."
4868,There are a limited number of disabled bays outside the museum but plenty of public car parks with disabled bays close by.
4869,"Second visit here, first since the pandemic. A large group of us travelled up for the weekend. Hotel was both disabled and child friendly. Our accessible room was bigger than last time , so plenty of room to manoeuvre. All the accessible rooms look out onto the back, which is a shame, missing out on the view. Plenty of grab rails and wet room shower & seat in bathroom, the shower has a tendency to flood bathroom, not ideal if in a power chair. Red cord in bathroom, and bedroom. Only fault I would find in bedroom is that all the storage hooks are up high, and no wheelchair height spyglass on door. Public areas roomy and accessible , staff fantastic, and tasty food. The rooms are unbearably hot, even without heating on, and the hotel have signs advising to keep the windows shut to keep the dreaded midge out! They do supply fans, which didn’t help much, but they say they are getting air conditioning installed in the future."
4870,"Access is fine, no lift ride is required to access the gym. As soon as you go in the front door, you will see the gym which has no steps/bumps or any obstacles to get over."
4871,There were two spacious accessible and clean toilets. 
4872,"Friendly, caring and helpful "
4873,"Fine on my scooter. 
Some steep paths would be hard on a manual wheel chair. The site is quite spread out. "
4874,Easy access no steps wide doorways
4875,"Taxi rank outside station, bus stop a bit far from entrance (city centre)."
4876,"I did not have need to speak to staff this visit, but generally have found them helpful if I've needed to ask for things"
4877,"Even although I am I weegie [Glaswegian] I haven't been here since I was a child.
I came to see the da Vinci drawings. There was 12 drawings from the Royal collection they had been 'acquired' by Charles II hundreds of years ago.
I didn't realize the museum shut at 5 o'clock sharp, it was probably just as well because we had the restaurant booked for dinner.
I will definitely be coming back, entering the main hall brought back a lot of childhood memories. It also houses one of my favorite paintings 'Christ of St. John of the Cross' by Salvador Dali."
4878,"It’s easy enough to get into the olde world pub, on the level from car park into the top dining area of pub, but then it’s steps everywhere. Better to sit outside where it’s level and plenty of cover under a large canopy. Sadly, you will miss a lot of the character of this pub due to limitations, but on a warm sunny day there are lots of areas to be able to sit and relax."
4879,Super Friendly and  eager to help.
4880,"The sea wall walk between Dawlish and Coryton Cove is a step free, padestrianised path just above the beach. There are wonderful, amazing views as on one side you have the sea and the other the busy Great Western railway line with trains regularly passing by. This route is quite short and leads to a sandy cove, café and accessible toilet.

Please be aware this route is not suitable for anyone when the weather is extreme.

I’ve also written a separate review for the sea wall walk between Dawlish to Dawlish Warren. 
"
4881,"This amazing 2-day festival is located on the edge of Paris in Longchamps Hippodrome Racecourse.  There was a wide range of different genres from dance to Indie.  I saw Kodaline, Jain, 21 Pilots, Martin Garrix, Mo, Bad Bunny, Biffy Clyro, the1975 and the Strokes; they were all brilliant in different ways but  21 Pilots were best for me!  A negative was that I had to book the accessible viewing platform and parking in advance and they were supposed to send me info about disabled parking and access before I went but despite E-mailing them three times, the info never arrived.  We had to phone to find out which entrance to go to eventually but once inside, members of the charity PSH treated me and my party like VIP's and escorted us all the way into the festival; golf buggies were available to take you in if you needed them and parking was very secure and on-site.  Staff were very helpful, friendly and kind. 
Red Cross tents also let me come in for a stretch out and a lie down when I needed to and coordinated with security to access an alternative pathway through secure areas to the viewing platforms rather than push through huge crowds; staff were all fantastic.  There was also a lovely picnic chill-out area with trees, water, a silent disco and children's play areas. 
The viewing platform was accessed via a long but manageable ramp.  I had initially thought that the viewing platforms would be too far away from the stages but I couldn't have been more wrong and I had a great view, another bonus was that officially, only 1 PA could access the platform with me but as  there were not many wheelchair festival goers using the viewing platforms, security said that the rest of my party (6) could go up too and this made a much better more inclusive atmosphere.  There was plenty room for dancing and the other wheelchair users had their crews up too.  There were only viewing platforms for the two main stages but as the crowds were smaller at the other two stages, I still had a great view.  I always felt safe and able to access help if I needed it as all staff (and festival-goers) I met were lovely."
4882,"The ensuite bathroom was quite large. The toilet and shower both had grab rails and the shower had two different kinds of seats to choose from.

Like the bedroom, there was no emergency cord. The shelf and the mirror were too high to use, but there was a lower mirror in the bedroom."
4883,There are 2 accessible toilets one on the ground floor and one upstairs beside the gymnasium. Both toilets are small but have handrails 
4884,"Hotel is very easy to find, just off the ring road - head in direction of the train station.
Plenty of open air parking right by the front door, including dedicated disabled parks.
Apart from needing a confirmed parking space with  extra space on passenger side, we had no specific requests.  But while we were there, a Swiss party with disabled guests arrived, who needed much more space to park and unload etc.  They had called in advance, and the hotel was very happy to accommodate them.  We know this, because the staff  let us know, so that we would not park in the space allocated to them."
4885,No dedicated parking although there is nearby street parking & car parks. 
4886,If the accessible door was working then access would be excellent
4887,There was a large car park adjacent to the entrance to the Blyth Battery which had a number of disabled bays.  We did find these bays hard to find though.  There was ev charging points.
4888,"We walked so I'm uncertain about public transport, although The Lighthouse is down a lane just off of the pedestrianised part of Buchanan Street which made it easy to reach. "
4889,"Accessible bedroom is on the 1st floor which can be reached by  a lift.
Stairs to bar and restaurant but if you ask staff they will bring a folding ramp"
4890,"Orchards is all on one level and has a level entrance, but has narrow corridors between furniture. The staff are very friendly and will move things out of the way. There is no bell or knocker on the door at the front but it is usually open except in winter, door width 830mm. There is also a door at the back to pick up heavy items, and Orchards will deliver. Till height 880mm. No hearing induction loop and no braille support. There is lots of seating available! "
4891,"There is no parking area designated to The Swan, however there are parking facilities across the road in Parliament Square. The nearest disabled parking bay is located nearby to this at the entrance to Parliament Street. There are also disabled parking facilities a short (3 minute) walk away in Shoprite car park. The walk from both of these car parks has lowered kerbs and pelican crossings with audio prompts when crossing roads."
4892,St Giles' Cathedral is located on Edinburgh's Royal Mile - right in the heart of the Old Town. There are many bus stops nearby. Not sure about Blue Badge parking nearby.
4893,"There is a concrete mound type ramp at the front door providing easy access and a ramp around the inside left to the main restaurant area which can also be accessed by a few steps immediately in front of the main entrance. There are grab rails/bannisters.
There is no automatic door but the staff are very helpful. 
The floor (and ramp) is a hard tiled surface which may be a slight problem for those using crutches or sticks when it's damp but is excellent for wheelchair users as it is extremely easy to manouvre on the smooth surface. 
Like most restaurants the level of lighting is quite ambient and low which isn't ideal for some people with certain visual impairments, although I am certain staff would assist.
Over all it was an amazing dining experience. The food is excellent. You can see it being freshly prepared in the kitchen as you wait. Water is served from beautiful ornate jugs to be enjoyed from matching goblets (or a glass if the goblet is too heavy).
There is a fantastic choice of dishes and everything we ate was absolutely delicious. The prices are decent too.

There is an accessible toilet. The bill can be paid by a portable card machine that is light and easy to press the buttons on. No annoying wire pulling at your arms or super strength required to enter your pin.

We will definitely be back!
"
4894,Very nice and clean.
4895,"I counted two in total - all well sign-posted and although I personally did not avail myself, I am informed they are both a decent size & well appointed."
4896,The staff are extremely helpful and welcoming.
4897,"Clean, tidy and very spacious."
4898,"Just a disabled loo, but a change table and screen in the buggy bunker. The volunteers are trying to get a full changing places asap"
4899,Easy to access the venue with automatic doors with push button to access. 
4900,"Le Caprice is tucked away in a cul de sac in St James's. However it is very easy to get to. The nearest tube station is Green Park which has step free access. Also there are lots of buses that stop close by. From Green Park tube take the lift or stairs to the Piccadilly Southside exit. This is the side of the street where Green Park and the Ritz are. Head to the Ritz and continue along till you come to Arlington Street, with the Ritz on it's corner, and turn right. The restaurant is further down on the right hand side of the road. There's are a couple of kerbs to navigate, which are not all drop kerbs."
4901,Staff are always friendly and helpful.
4902,Staff spoken to were sympathetic about the parking situation.
4903,"This hotel is well situated on two bus routes and also has plenty of parking. It's a good location for Musselburgh. It has recently been refurbished and feels clean and fresh. The staff are helpful and friendly and it's possible to move to the Bistro area without being out of doors, although it is technically next door. There is only one fully accessible bedroom. It was already booked so we stayed in another room which was fine, other than not having a fully accessible bathroom. This is a good choice of hotel on the outskirts of Edinburgh but within easy reach of it.

Updated Dec 2021 - there are now two new accessible rooms and the whole hotel, already very accessible, is more accessibility-aware. Again, just like in the past, the staff are super helpful and flexible. This is a really good choice of accessible accommodation in or near Edinburgh - worth travellling out of town for."
4904,we did not see any of the staff there but but the park is really well maintained the council are doing a good job
4905,"Disabled spaces in main car park, but if full, a couple of hidden spaces at front."
4906,"Access in and around the building :-

Despite not being designed for wheelchair access I was able to get in three of the sites and visit five of the apartments. I would encourage people to have a conversation to discuss your specific needs.

Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms :-

Not applicable.

Access in the dining area :-

In the five apartments I visited I was able to get my powerchair, 68 cm wide and 116 cm in length into the dining area.

Access to other facilities :-

In the five apartments I visited I was able to get my powerchair, 68 cm wide and 116 cm in length into the kitchen area."
4907,"Helpful, friendly, held doors open."
4908,There is an accessible loo near the entrance. Fairly spacious and plenty of room for my powerchair. May be a but tight with a carer / PA.
4909,Very good disabled toilet facilities.
4910,"Free car park outside for Museum and accessible promenade.The Museum tells the story of the local fishing and seafaring community,with a fully restored lifeboat and a fishing cobble.The museum is on 2 floors with a wheelchair accessible lift.The are accessible toilets and a reasonably priced cafe."
4911,"Toilets very accessible. waste bin set in unsuitable location though, blocking access to toilet from one side. Changing facilities. User friendly shower. Red cord card-ised"
4912,"Great spacious clean accessible toilet. Red chord tie was not freely hanging. It’s on the ground level next to bar, it’s not too obvious that it's an accessible toilet, maybe larger sign?"
4913,It all starts with there being very few disabled parking spaces so arrive early or be forced to park quite a fair bit away from the stadium. 
4914,"ThIs is the best holiday venue we've ever been. The family is the most welcoming and understanding. We have an autistic boy and he always looks forward to going back to Helsey house cottages every year for the last five years. The spacious open plan kitchen, dining and sitting area allows the  family to be together with a range of things yo do including colouring, puzzles,a range of novels, free Wifi,  TV and dvd. The outdoors are amazing with a spacious garden, swings, trampoline, climbing frame, swimming pool, tables and chairs at the front and back garden. The bedrooms are comfortable and the bathroom offers a bath and separate shower. This home to home venue will offer you the best relaxing and peaceful holiday break for the whole family."
4915,"The loo was clean and a good size, I had no issue turning or transferring, I was unsure of its location within the building but staff were happy to direct me. "
4916,"The toilet is ok, enough room for a manual chair but I think it could be potentially awkward with something large. There were grab rails. 

Not sure if there was a Changing Places Toilet "
4917,"In the station, all on one level.."
4918,"Most helpful and friendly. Although very busy after a match, the door and bar staff always squeeze you in and make you feel welcome."
4919,"The 5 rooms, bar, lounge, pool and hot tub are all fully accessible without any part seeming ""medical"".     The converted farmhouse is in the middle of nowhere, well away from the tourist trail.   As such if you don't have your own transport it is not possible to leave the guesthouse other than on the organised trips or by arranging private trips.    That said, it is all so good there is no reason to leave!   LP aims to make the  real  Spain (history and culture) accessible to wheelchair users in a relaxed, supportive way.    Breakfast 9 to 11 and trips 11 to 4 with evening meal at 7.30 pm - (think I have remembered that right.)"
4920,Friendly but they could do with helping out a little bit more!
4921,"The staff at The Storytelling Centre in Edinburgh were extremely welcoming and helpful on arrival, explaining everything we (a group of 9 adults with learning disabilities and 5 staff) needed to know and making sure   we had room to sit down while we waited. Some members of our group needed to use the lift and access was straightforward and eased further by the efficiency of The Storytelling centre staff. We were given seating right at the front of the theatre which really benefited the members of our group with visual impairment and with concentration difficulties.
The 30 minute show was also the perfect length for our group with a simple story, lovely puppets and a variety of sounds.
After the show we all had coffee in the Storytelling Centre Cafe and here again the staff were kind and helpful and moved around chairs and tables so we were able to sit together.  
Many many thankyous Edinburgh Storytelling Centre for making our visit so enjoyable and smooth! We recommend you most highly and will definitely be back next year!!"
4922,"Staff on the information desk in the Great Court are friendly and helpful. Other staff are variable. On this visit I tried to enter the Museum via the back entrance. The lift there was out of order, but without any sign or information to tell us it was out of order. Eventually a pig-rude member of staff came and barked at me that it was broken and that I had to go outside and work my way round to the front of the Museum. Here I found one of the two platform lifts was, as usual, broken down."
4923,"The accessible bathroom wet rooms with level access and disabled toilets are again well sized, have grab rails on either side of the toilet and by the sink, and have sinks which are easy to get under in a wheelchair."
4924,"The tram stops are in handy locations around the city, close to other transport links such as bus stops. The stop at the airport is really good, and there always seems to be someone on hand to help you find your way or purchase tickets."
4925,"Roomy & clean with grabrails and red cord. Tap in sink dripping. 
Bright coloured toilet seat good for people with dementia.
RWA is going to have a Changing Places toilet installed as part of the building project to improve access, so this will be available when it reopens in spring 2022. 
"
4926,"Staff and good good, access terrible."
4927,"There are a few entrances depending if you want to enter the hotel or the restaurant. I believe all entrances have a ramp though. The restaurant and hotel entrances definitely have ramp access. Once inside the restaurant, we were greeted by the waitress who took us to our table, which was immediately to the side of the door. It was a cold night so we asked if we could sit someone else away from the door, but there are only a few tables on the lower section which are located near to the door. It wasn't a problem though as they already had heaters positioned next to our table. There are many more tables on the upper level with is accessed via a few steps. Where we were sitting inside the restaurant was quite spacious and we were next to the bar. There was also a large TV at the side of the bar, so I reckon it could be watched from anywhere in the restaurant. "
4928,"The area has lots of Festival ""helpers"" who were great at guiding me to a good spot and telling me what's on."
4929,Top notch for mobile toilets if you have ever had to rely on portable loo described as accessible.  
4930,Two parking bays outside. Bus access is difficult. They're currently building a wheelchair accessible bridge so you can walk to the Wyvern from Chaddesden. 
4931,"There is plenty of on street parking in the vicinity, free with a blue badge, but no dedicated car park."
4932,"There are a few disabled parking spaces outside tropical world, but also more parking on Park Lane and three other car parks. There are regular buses from and into town with regular bus stops.
There is also a small train that goes around the park that you can use if you don't fancy walking the whole way around . "
4933,The club obviously takes it's disabled supporters in to consideration. They have a Hibernian Disabled Supporters Association that meet monthly. And everything is thought out to make it as easy as possible to get around.
4934,Main doors were automatic and doors that were not automatic were open. Lift access although very small lift. Plenty space to move around.
4935,Staff all helpful and friendly. 
4936,"Accessible, just like it should be! Easy to reach too - close by the main eating area and not miles away down a corridor."
4937,a morning engaging with farm animal with students from a specialist college in Lancaster
4938,"We did not use it, but there is a bus stop at the zoo. There are a few disabled parking spaces near the entrance, but these filled up quickly. My advice is get to the zoo early if parking in a disabled space is important to you. Be warned, everyone pays for parking. When we went everyone had to pay £2.50 to park. There is just the one price for parking & it is for all day. There is a pay machine at the end of the row of disabled parking spaces but it wasn't obvious. I am in two minds about paying for parking. We have got very used to parking for free with the Blue Badge, but signs in the car park say the money is used to care for the animals. I gave 3 out of 5 possible stars because of the parking charge & I didn't feel there were enough disabled parking spaces."
4939,"Two modern Radar Key Operated Wheelchair accessible toilets, well kept and very clean!"
4940,"It was fantastic, I will be definitely do again. The staff are very friendly and great what they do"
4941,"I was pleasantly surprised to see a disabled access chair lift to the sea, for those inclined to go for a swim. The chair allowed for extra freedom and opportunities for those unable to use the steps or access the sea via the pebble beach. Copacabana beach also had a pebble path for a long stretch along the beach, allowing for wheelchair friendly access right along the majority of the beach, the restaurant was also accessable and served decent meals, however quite expensive. "
4942,"In my accessible room their was an accessible toilet with grab rails and emergency cord.

In the reception area by the Beefeater restaurant and bar is an accessible toilet. There is a sign on it saying ""Polite Notice. Please see a member of Beefeater staff  or reception for the key"". See photo. On the first time I went to use it the toilet was locked. Given the notice I went to reception to get the key. It turns out that the accessible toilet does not require a key. So if it is locked it's in use. The staff have put the notice up to try to deter people who are just popping in to use the facilities.  The toilet was clean, large but not spacious. There were grab rails and an emergency cord which reached to the floor."
4943,"There are some bus stops on George IV Bridge, the number 23, 27, 41 and 42 stop there. I think it might be on some of the tour bus routes too.
Parking isn't great nearby. You might be lucky and get a space on Chambers Street.
The restaurant is walkable from Waverley Station but it is up a steep hill. "
4944,Plenty of room to the accessible toilet and inside. Clean and tidy with standard additional handles.
4945,"When arriving at Morrison's I could see there was ample blue badge spaces situated near the front of the store.  The store entrance is covered over and is on the same level as the car park making access easy.  Once inside the store I could see the isles were wide enough for their own shop mobility scooters, and suitable for most wheelchairs or walking aids.  The toilets are easily accessible and just inside the entrance to the right, next to the kiosk. The toilets are locked, and you can obtain the key from staff at the kiosk.  Staff were very bright, friendly and accommodating, advising location of wheelchair trolleys.  "
4946,Took a taxi.  There is parking outside and on Glasgow Green but not sure about disabled places.
4947,"I did not visit the toilet, but it is listed as ""partially accessible"" online. There is also a loop system entered. "
4948,"This is based in a converted commercial unit, there is a lift to the cafe, but access to the lift on the ground and especially first floor is tight for a manual wheelchair "
4949,There is disabled parking bays near the entrance to the building 
4950,Brilliant! They've put a lot of thought into their accessibility. There is a ramp to the side of the main steps at the entrance. There is a decent sized lift serving all floors. There are helpful large print guides located at the entrance to most of the main galleries. The one place that was a little crowded was the shop.
4951,As soon as we arrived with me in a wheelchair a young lady offered to help with our luggage. She then phoned the airport to book special assistance to take me from the hotel to the airport the next morning. In the morning when the assistance was late the man on the desk kept phoning them until they arrived. 
4952,Pleanty of spaces and disabled parking for my dad and friend to go in.
4953,Lift available.  No steps into the Theatre entrance.  Provide wheelchair spaces in auditorium. Have BSL signed performances. Produce a list of special effects and a social story for their relaxed pantomime performance so that people with a learning disabilty / autism can be prepared for their visit.  Allow pre-show day visits and look around theatre.  Signage is clear
4954,Small car park but still had disabled space
4955,"Boots is generally fairly accessible throughout. Level entrance. The front door is 1150mm wide, and opens automatically. There is no bell or knocker for assistance. There usually have a mobile hearing induction loop, when we visited it wasn’t working but they are getting a new one. Boots have a Hearing Care Centre. The till height is 800mm. There is Braille on prescribed medication. There is seating available. Staff are helpful and undergo disability and dementia awareness training. Boots will deliver for house bound clients. There is no toilet, the nearest disabled toilet is in Costa Coffee a few doors down."
4956,Signs were good but not all signs had symbols at the entrance. They did in other parts of the building. The symbols were small.
4957,Very helpful.  We let them know we were coming and they greeted us personally.  Escorted us to our seats and made sure we were comfortable.
4958,Parking to rear of property
4959,Disabled Toilet at the entrance of Marina building which doubles as a tourist information.
4960,"There are four accessible parking place right in front of the main doors, the rest of the car park is very large."
4961,"Room 204 has a wet room and, like almost all accessible rooms at Premier Inn it is a good size with plenty of room for a wheelchair user to move about freely.
Width of main door: 86cm.
The room is located on the ground floor of a separate block from where the reception is and the automatic door to that block is operated by placing you room key card on the sensor.

The king size bed was made up of two single zip and lock beds and, at a height of 49cm it was okay for my wife to transfer from her wheelchair. The mattress was comfortable enough, and two firm pillows and two softer pillows were available to us. 

The window looked out to a hedgerow, which helped to block out the traffic noise from the M5, just over 200 metres beyond it. The outer double glazed window could be opened to a degree, which afforded us with fresh air but, when closed along with the secondary sliding window meant there was no noise from outside to be heard
The blackout curtains were effective, plunging the room into darkness.
The A/C comes from a standalone wall-mounted unit, effectively cooling the room to 19ºC. The fan was quiet with the only noise to be heard from it being the draining of the excess water.

There were enough electrical sockets around the room but none at the sides of the bed; this wasn’t a particular problem for us but could be troublesome for a guest that needs to plug in a CPAP device or other essential device during the night.  I’m sure though that the hotel would be able to provide an extension cable.
The basic Wi-Fi was weak, with a few dropouts. Our mobile data (O²) was weak.

As is common with most of the hotels in this chain, the accessible bathroom was a good size, with a sliding door that opened to a width of 82cm. 
The thermostatic shower was easy to control and the water pressure was very good; it remained at a constant temperature whilst showering.
We often find that the shower area in PI wet rooms doesn’t have a shelf on which to place shampoo, body wash and so on.  It can be very difficult for a disabled person, when seated, to reach necessary items when the floor is the only place to put them. This shower did have a soap dish, so half marks for that, but a bigger shelf is needed.
The bathroom though was showing signs of wear and tear; the shower seat was well past its sell-by date and my wife found it to be very uncomfortable.

I would describe the room as being in the old style with a couple of additions, such as the large screen TV with the HDMI input socket below.
It was pleasing that the room still had the old style wardrobe unit, which we prefer to the ones in the updated rooms; it offers more storage capacity.  The room also lacked the vanity mirror of the newer rooms, which is always set too high for a wheelchair user.

One major problem in this room is the height of the coat hooks which, at 168cm from the floor are totally useless for a wheelchair user; see photograph.  This problem could be easily rectified; they are fixed to a wooden panel, which could be lowered to the appropriate height. Take note management! 

The hotel only has a breakfast room, which we did not use.  There is though a Toby Inn, which is not affiliated to the hotel, next door and within walking distance; we didn’t use that either. 
"
4962,Loos were easy to find at the top station
4963,Disabled spaces just round the corner from front
4964,"Positive points : Push button door, flat threshold, smooth floor, medium-large bathroom. Negative points: only one washroom, narrow walled area near the cash that created a bottleneck. Aisles are not wide enough for two wheelchairs to pass one another so if there is an oncoming wheelchair (or any large adult sized person) you have to move aside or back up to let them pass."
4965,"Lift was a little small, but the buttons were large and easy to see/use.  The door to the cabin was automatic, you slid your room card in a small black box at the side of the door (in the same manner you'd do on a door handle normally) and the cabin door pung open.  Similarly in the room there was a button that did the same to let you get out.  

Took half mark off due to the massive bumps to fly your chair over to get in the room/bathroom"
4966,Overall the Taverna is a good restaurant with a very good value lunch buffet. But what really made the visit great was the staff. They were flexible and welcoming and weren’t faxed by us either being a big party or that one of our party used a wheelchair.
4967,Male and female toilets with all required rails and ample side transfer space from left to right. The cord was too short but in their defence the toilets were new and had been signed off by building control.  Chief exec was right on to it. 
4968,A few free disabled bays near entrance but it's a bit of a battle to get one. Some ordinary Pay & Display £5 over 2 hours.
4969,Access is excellent all doors to the outside are automatic and there are no doors into the shops or restaurants 
4970,Finding the loos on the jetty can be a challenge. The RADAR loo in Windermere had 2 bins which needed to be removed before I could get my chair in.
4971,"There is plenty of parking, with labelled disabled spaces, although they appear no wider than the other spaces. I would recommend parking in the overflow car park if you are able to manage being slighter further from the entrance.

There is a nearby bus stop on Bexhill Road, serviced by the low floor 98 and 99 buses.
"
4972,"BIG effort for accessibility for all - just a little more thought or training required, I feel. Also, the tables are bolted to the floor so there isn't a lot of room for wheelchairs, scooters etc."
4973,"This hotel does not have parking but, if you have a blue badge there is plenty of on-street parking available very near to the hotel entrance.  On the cathedral side of Temple Row West, right outside the entrance, there is specific disabled parking with room for about eight cars.  On Waterloo Street there is regular on-street metered parking with a limit of four hours but, of course, as a blue badge holder you can park there without limit.  We got a spot right outside the hotel entrance, which was nice!  "
4974,"From the entrance, staff are recognising of any potential assistance that may be required and point out the inclusion and access facilities that are available. They also form that their staff and guides are aware of being able to offer additional assistance. Could not be more attentive."
4975,"Plenty of flights to Tenerife South Airport most days from most UK airports and the complex is a 30 minute taxi/minibus ride away,i hire a company that provides transfers for wheelchair users called Orange Bus in Tenerife."
4976,"The V and A is the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design. It has permanent and temporary exhibitions covering a wide range of themes from  architecture, furniture, fashion, photography, sculpture, painting, jewellery, Asian art and theatre. It also has regular events. It's housed in an old Victorian building which has been excellently adapted with lifts and ramps to create excellent step free access.
This review is of the Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up exhibition, which is located on the ground floor of the museum and is on until Sunday 4 November 2018."
4977,"The biggest cinema screen in Britain. The screen is more than 20 metres high (nearly the height of five double-decker buses) and 26 metres wide. While there is excellent access, staff disability awareness left a lot to be desired."
4978,Lower level to restaurant accessible.
4979,"Has great access, they have a main door which has a step, however the side door to the right is a flat entrance.  Has a dedicated large disabled toilets."
4980,They are extremely well trained (guides) with Cathedral staff polite and professional.
4981,Very accessible. Lots of seats. Great views. Might be different if people in front stand up. Lots of space and easy to get in.
4982,Adequate toilet
4983,"Went on mobity scooter
Some great boardwalk and viewi g platforms to see lots of differ birds plus turtles and alligators. Some paths had bumpy roots but there was always one side that was clear. Had to stop near the dunes as it was too sandy. "
4984,The British Library is on Euston Road next door next door to St Pancras Station and close to King's Cross and Euston Stations. Nearby is King's Cross tube station which is step free. Euston tube station is not step free and Euston Square tube station is only step free west bound. There are also a number of bus routes that stop outside the library. I travelled by bus. There is a bus stop directly outside and one the opposite side of the street.
4985,This was a nice wheelchair accessible restaurant with great friendly staff.
4986,"Corridors a bit narrow .There should be more lifts as I had to wait for ages , as they were all busy."
4987,"Not enough seats just to sit down, very long walks everywhere.

Rude/Unhelpful staff that are there to enforce their petty rules rather than help.

Getting there can be difficult on public transport.

Disabled loos are good but not enough of them and don't be suprised if you are not allowed near them at the end of the night."
4988,6 Blue Badge parking bays outside museum and a flat walking area to inside.   Automatic entrance door.  Train Station too far to walk.  Regular buses.
4989,"There is no car park and it is on a pedestrian street, the nearest train stations are Queen street and Central, there are also several bus stops near by and the closest Subway stations are Buchanan Street and St Enochs."
4990,Use the wheelchair slope
4991,"The manager is extremely accommodating, and understands that the facilities need changing, and is in the process of planning new disabled rooms and bathrooms. The general staff are also very accommodating and will move tables in the dining room if necessary. The chef will also create meal plans based around any dietary needs."
4992,Limited due to it being a very small converted station waiting room on a platform however they’ve done their absolute best and made use of the facilities. 
4993,"Access is classified by the National Park as suitable ""for some"" which is fair. Once you arrived at the gate to access the path, the route goes sharply uphill on loose chippings - grip for wheels is poor and even my battery powered Viper powercycle needed help. The route undulates a bit before heading downwards to the stream. There are lots of cows here in the lower section but they ignore visitors. The path is compacted earth by now but littered with rocks, tree roots and cow pats. There's another gate, wide enough for a chair but help will be needed to open it.  The very last bit is inaccessible due to rocks and narrow gate but you'll get close enough for a wonderful view of the cliff face. Bit tricky to turn round on the bumpy, narrow path so care needed. Rating reflects trickiness of route but it's worth the effort if you have reasonable equipment."
4994,Top notch disabled loo with masses of space.  NB - requires Radar key to access
4995,Now they have the newly built club house access is not
4996,"There is a lift to the next floor, there is no induction loop"
4997,Movement  throughout the original Grade II listed Manor House is good as there are no steps or trip hazards. Leaving the lounge to the dining room or function room is easy through the wide doorways.
4998,"There are disabled accessible doors on all floors, with power assisted doors for easy opening. Some of them are located inside the main toilet blocks and others are separately located. They are clearly sign posted. Toilets have emergency alarms and grab rails. On two separate occasions when I visited the emergency cord was not reaching the floor, I reported it to staff, and on my most recent visit the cord touched the floor. The toilets are usually very clean but on my last occasion one of the disabled toilets had a very wet floor. I reported this to a member of staff and they immediately got on the phone to their cleaning department. "
4999,"There is no no designated parking for Brambles itself. However, nearby, there are a number of Blue Badge designated spaces, which are adjacent to the main thoroughfare. For non Blue Badge holders free (off season) parking (paid Mar-Nov) are available on Main Street or The Avenue. Holiday weekends and the summer season can be especially busy with cars, touring buses and bikers. 
The nearest railway station is 17 miles away at Dalmally.

5000,We had a non accessible toilet and it was very hard to use
5001,"Staff were wonderful, friendly and always on hand to assist and could not do enough for their customers.  They were wonderful."
5002,"Helpful, pleasant and very busy. "
5003,"Plenty of space within the pub, it can get very busy on a Friday / Saturday though. Step free entrance."
5004,"The staff are helpful and accommodating, when you walk into the store you are approached by a member of staff can help you towards what you are looking for and lead you to someone who can give you the support you need. "
5005,There was no marked disabled parking as the property only had roadside parking outside of the villa.
5006,Sited in a pedestrian area.
5007,The model village is completely accessible. The only potential difficulty is that there is about 15 metres of gravel between the car parking bay and entrance. We managed no problem  pushing the manual wheelchair but may be more difficult for others depending on the weight of the person. I’m sure there would be no problem reversing up to the entrance to drop off but we didn’t need to. 
5008,Good access to the main parts of the building. No steps.
5009,"Unsure if it would be accessible but the whole area is compacted stone path, tarmac or flat grass which allowed our scooter to get almost everywhere. Stunning views. Two excellent independent cafes adjacent to car park."
5010,With a blue badge you are able to park in front of the venue.   BUT although there is adequate parking at the nearby carparks they are very expensive
5011,"There are no step-free stations in the area, and parking is difficult. Quite a lot of buses serve the area immediately around the restaurant."
5012,"The accessible toilets were at the start of the park. They were clean and well kept, as well as spacious. Other, non-accessible toilets were situated frequently and well sign posted throughout the park and I was able to use these frequently. "
5013,"Ann and Gordon were really helpful, both before we arrived and during our stay, they are very knowledgeable about the local area and are keen to support disabled users to access their holiday cottages.  "
5014,"Staff seated us to rear to be near to loo, at our request - they were very helpful when we booked."
5015,"There is a very small cafe doing takeaways. It has good level access and is close to the blue badge spaces. At the moment it serves only very light snacks such as coffee, cakes and rolls. The toilets are alongside, with a separate entrance.

There is a good view from the car park. A wider view, however, can be seen from the top of a steep hill, reached by steps leading to a purpose built structure at the top. It is understandable that this is not accessible. There is also a path low down to the right of the visitor centre and it's a shame it is not a little wider and smoother to allow wheelchair use. Having said that, it's still worth visiting as less able can easily see the loch. There are many car parks around Loch Lomond, such as Luss and Balloch where this is not possible."
5016,The front entrance is accessible via a ramp and automatic doors.
5017,Very accessible. No steps & all on the level. Most stores have sufficient aisle space for wheelchairs.
5018,We drove and parked at the concert car park across from the venue. Quite difficult to find the disabled spaces within the car park but once we did it was great and handy for the concert hall
5019,We took a taxi to it as it is quite a walk from the bus stop. Disabled parking  is available at the entrance.
5020,Very friendly helpful staff at reception
5021,"It’s quite easy to get to the public disabled toilet, nicely furnished in pale colours, with pull cord and grab rail, (see photo of WC in part one) Very clean and well maintained."
5022,The staff are very friendly and patience.
5023,Staff are very friendly and are delighted to see new visitors in the galleries. They are very helpful and I could not fault them in any way.
5024,"Lovely place to visit.  The Staff go out of their way to help as much as they can.  There is a lift into the venue but it isn't an obstacle as the Staff will assist where needed.  
"
5025,Staff are very friendly and happy to help and answer any questions.
5026,"Drop off places right outside venue
Car parking close by with plenty of disabled places"
5027,The staff are very friendly and are happy to help. Any queries and questions are answered efficiently and by friendly staff. 
5028,Clean and accessible.
5029,"Honesty very nice but when I asked for mascarpone the waitress listed the ingredients to my partner and asked if I would be ok with them. This is a pet hate and I did say 'hello, I am here.'  I think she got it."
5030,"At end of long uphill ramp the entrance is through a double door pull handles, but had to leave wheelchair in the porch as then tight area into hotel with chairs just too close together, but other patrons were willing to move for us to squeeze past on the arm of my wife. It’s not a big restaurant so not far for the walking needed to reach our table. 
Disappointedly, there are four steps to get down to go to the bar lounge.
"
5031,"Car parking close to the entrance, the whole zoo was compact and accessible by wheelchair.  I would recommend going out of season as I would imagine the space would feel different when crowded.

Only one area was problematic the walk way to and from the Den Area for the bears.  This is not suitable for wheelchairs because the ground is uneven and steep.  I have written to the Zoo to ask them to sign post this until they can smooth it over or landscape for access."
5032,"We found the Life Care Centre in Stockbridge very accessible. There are automatic doors to get in, a large accessible toilet and good sized lift to take wheelchair users upstairs. Staff at reception were also very helpful."
5033,Staff were really helpful and approachable and offered assistance at tight corners etc; they were also very informative.
5034,"Signage for blue badge parking wasn't obvious to us (bear left, and drive up to Reception).  I couldn't have managed without a carer as the accessible room was a long way from reception and restaurant through FIVE sets of very heavy doors."
5035,"One small step at the (inward opening) door, but should be no challenge to a solo manual wheelchair user. A helpful staff member spotted us and had the door open very quickly. Good circulating spaces inside. We were offered a choice of two tables, both of which were easily accessible. 
"
5036,The restaurant is on the ground floor. There is a ramp to the main entrance with automatic doors. There is an open doorway to the restaurant and plenty of space to get around between tables and chairs.
5037,In room
5038,"Pleasant enough, but not talkative, just got on with it."
5039,Good as they have made an effort by ramping both tunnels but see above re having to go outside and back in again to get between bar and loo area/stage area.
5040,Very friendly staff that are very knowledgeable and will provide assistance if needed.
5041,Polite and efficient - knowledge of Japanese is useful if you want to get things done quickly.
5042,The main gardens have good access. The first impression wasn't good as the entrance via the gift shop is extremely tight for a wheelchair. However once through its good.   We attempted the woodland areas which were difficult in some areas and in fact we ultimately had to turn back.  Overall though it was a good visit.
5043,"Parking was s little tricky. Although there were plenty of disabled bays, it wasn't immediately obvious where they were, or how to get to the restaurant from the parking bays. It feels like they have compromised ease of use, for a quirky design layout for the mall. "
5044,The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
5045,"We visited in an accessible taxi - parking near the theatre is not good. Also, there was a problem of no fully dropped curb outside the main entrance."
5046,"There is nothing quite like being at Murrayfield! There is a wheelchair ballot to keep things fair and th Is is drawn near games. Once you are there,  there are plenty of accessible toilets and your space offers a free hot drink before the game starts. It’s often cold so wrap up!

The stadium tour is also accessible and well worth it."
5047,Lots of space for a mobility scooter/wheel chair and the museum is over 3 floors with access via a large lift to each floor.
5048,"They were fab, we had a number of people with learning issues and they were amazing with them.  Made sure the food came reasonably quickly and was exactly what was asked for."
5049,Staff are friendly enough
5050,"Good clean facility in convenient location for shops and carpark.
Quick response from attendant via the intercom to let us in as we didn't have a RADAR key.
The shopping centre website says that the table is height-adjustable, but it didn't look like it was and no instructions were provided for how to use it.
There was enough room for 2 carers and a wheelchair without having to squeeze round the wheelchair.  Size of room was approx 2.2mx2.6m"
5051,"Great Parking, easy paths for mobility scooter, wide smooth corridors. Wonderful ground floor accessible bedroom, with easy wet room.
Lift access to all areas we needed in to."
5052,"Rooms all have excellent wetroom facilities so unless you really need to have a disabled equipped room you may be able to manage with a standard room. Lift to all floors. Level access. Lots of seating in dining area and lounge. Only 2 down sides: 1) the corridor doors are not automatic and are  very heavy so can be difficult to open if you are using a walker or wheelchair. 2) the accessible rooms are only available as a double bed, no twin bed accessible rooms. We have stayed here dozens of times because it's pet friendly, has easy use facilities and plenty of disabled parking."
5053,"Other than the person at the desk, we had no interaction with staff members, although there were some going about.  Also talks were given at various times during the day."
5054,"Roomy  & clean, plenty of grabrails
"
5055,The Royal Mews situated next to Buckingham Palace is a little museum which stores and explains a bit about the carriages and cars used by the royal family on state occasions. There is lots to see in such a small area and is very interesting. There is a small gift shop and there is a good sized accessible toilet.
5056,Certainly very friendly but service was a little slow and some staff seemed a bit inexperienced when we visited. 
5057,"A lovely day out to see all sorts of motor vehicles, I just wished there was more access to the refreshment kiosks and automatic doors. "
5058,"Recently refurbished pub is very big so has good spaces between tables and chairs.
Doors are heavy so you will need help from another person if using a wheelchair or stick.
Tables are high enough for wheelchairs to fit under which is always welcome.
Staff were pleasant but the food was just ok.  Average pub food that felt like it was from a chain pub.  It recently was taken over and they removed all the microbrewery to go down a different path.  
Disabled toilet was easily accessed, clean and large enough."
5059,Toilet had a self closing door which made it more awkward than it had to be. Toilet was right sided transfer with grab rails (navy) around toilet and sink. There was a lowered hook but a giant bin next to toilet in transfer space due to also being a baby changing facility. You'd struggle to fit two people and a wheelchair in this loo. 
5060,"The hotel's entrance has a single step with no handrail. I use a crutch and I didn't find any problem with this. Staff confirmed that they have a portable ramp that they can use if required. At the hotel entrance there was a doorman who welcomed me and opened the double doors for me. The Drawing Room is the first door on the right as you enter the hotel. The door was already opened when I arrived. 

The Drawing Room has movable tables and chairs. The table was ready when we arrived. There is two type of seating. There are sofas without arms and there are armchairs. I sat in an armchair but before I did the waiter, offered to get me a cushion. I ended with two, sitting on one and having one at my back. The chair is very comfortable but also firm, I felt very comfortable and my back was well supported. I was a little stiff when it was time to leave, but we moved the table, rather than my chair and it was very easy to get up. "
5061,"Basic but functional. Well signed, a good ramp, lots of space, some handles. Basically a posh shed, but it did the job."
5062,"Both the hotel entrance, at front of extension, and the read Spa entrance, are on the level, and easy enough you use. There is a lift available to get you to the first floor disabled room, and inside it’s all on the level for you. We found a very nice cafe come small restaurant, offering light dishes and drinks, and this is on the level as well."
5063,"Booked a comedy night with a set meal beforehand, and had a fantastic night out.  Unfortunately the comedy club has about 20 very steep steps down to the venue, and although there are rails it is quite difficult to get down. 
If you're able to get down, it was a hilarious night out. "
5064,"The shop-floor staff are friendly and keen to be helpful. They were very apologetic about me getting stuck in the lift, and did their utmost to get me free as quickly as possible. They're a really nice team. 

The management, however, get fewer stars because

- They have designed unstable shelving in a really cramped environment, not suitable for wheelchair users
- They do not maintain a reliable lift
- They make it hard to get into and out of the lift because of the product standing and lying around the near the lift, obstructing what should be a clear path to/from the lift. 
- They have installed credit card readers which cannot be detached from their cradles"
5065,There is a dedicated ramp which is okay to manoeuvre around. The main problem here is the huge lip to get over at the main entrance. It's huge!
5066,"I only down mark this because there are some cobbles and just a few shops that are not easily accessible.  Otherwise smooth and easy to get about.  Most shops very helpful. 
Marks and Spencer is accessible through the Saturday Market door."
5067,"There is one accessible toilet. Only 3.5 stars because to access the disabled toilet you need to hold open a heavy door leading to the main toilets whilst then opening the disabled toilet so you need a free hand or help. Toilet was clean with easy to reach flush, low level mirror and hand dryer."
5068,"One entrance is easy to access, the atmosphere of the outside areas were good.  Difficult in getting a parking space."
5069,The toilet and shower room are combined. The toilet has a hoist over and bars on either side. The toilet is higher than average which made the personal toilet riser we had taken unnecessary.
5070,A accessible loo with an additional raised seat if you needed it. With drop down supports. There was also a shower chair seat to aide with showering and anti slip mats provided.
5071,Excellent
5072,"The toilet was large and well kept, the door stayed open so it was easy to move in and out.."
5073,"I managed to get into the disabled toilet but it was a bit tricky. There was not a lot of room to turn round in front of the door to go in straight. And inside the toilet, the space was only just big enough for my powerchair.

It could have been better but it could also have been worse."
5074,"A gathering of bobbing, colourful boats with a line of harbour-front parking spaces make this a great place to stop for a picnic or a stroll. You'll most likely see a seal dipping around the boats too!"
5075,"Plenty of space to park.  Came in own car - would be difficult by public transport, though not too long taxi ride from Whitby station."
5076,"There are three access designated car parks in Apple 1, Apple 2 and Banana. These are not solely limited to those who are in possession of a Blue Badge and can also be utilised by those who have mobility issues, require a wheelchair or have organised access assistance. 

There are manual wheelchairs available in Apple 1 car park. To get to the Visitor Centre from Apple 1 car park you need to go down a tarmac path. The path is 32 metres long. The gradient is 1:18 with a short steeper section at 1:10.

If you park in a standard car park it can be a distance to walk to arrive at the eden project front entrance. "
5077,"Mobility scooters are available for a donation.

There is seating all around the garden, so plenty of rest spots.

If you're walking, there are a small number of steps out from the shop, accessing the gardens themselves.

There are some steep walks if you're fit enough."
5078,"A wheelchair accessible restaurant and pub, with very friendly staff that are more than happy to help with anything they can. Good food and relaxed atmosphere. "
5079,"We went to the cafe first which is on the ground floor. There are automatic doors and then level access. Next to the cafe are male/female/accessible toilets.

There is a lift to go to the main arena - we didnt realise at first that the lift is outside, beside the stairs. So if in the cafe, you need to go back out to this. It is signposted on the wall outside, but high up, and we hadn't noticed it, however staff were helpful when we asked about it.

From the lift, you go to level 3, and it is then level access. In the foyer (when basketball on) there are a variety of food and merchandise stands. There are also can/snack machines throughout.

In the arena there are many wheelchair spaces all on the same level as the entrance and foyer. They each have at least one seat next to them and are in short rows spaced right around the arena.

Steps to other seats. Yellow edging on steps but didn't have handrails most of the way. Flip-up seats.

For Basketball the arena was quite noisy. This might not suit everybody, but for others it adds to the experience and atmosphere."
5080,Easy viewing of the animals with smooth surfaces. Only a few reptiles not accessible. Spacious cafe and good sized toilet with grippy floor. Snacks only after 3. Parking one building away for double paid hrs.  Friendly staff.
5081,"As others have said, the cathedral is really interesting and they have put ramps in to make it as accessible as possible. If you can manage a few steps and then sit down I think just about every where can be seen. 

We joined a group for a tour and it was worth it. Then there's a lift to get down to the cafe and loo  "
5082,"The car park is situated immediately outside the Maltings entrance. There are 44 spaces, 8 of which are for the use of disabled badge holders. The car park is situated within easy access of the town's main street."
5083,"Good sized accessible bathroom with roll-in shower and plenty of grab bars; see photos. 
We didn’t’ use the accessible toilet near the reception. 
"
5084,"There are a number of accessible rooms with large bathrooms and accessible loos. Loos can also be found on the foyer , bar and conference facility areas."
5085,"The medical museum has it's own car park with disabled bays, and is situated on several main bus routes and a main road, making it easy to get to despite being a long way from the train station.
The entrance to the museum is level, and while the first door is manual (but permanently propped open), the second is automated (swings outwards). The desk is right by front door, and it would appear sensory kits are available for autistic visitors.
All displays are fully wheelchair accessible, although some are narrow in places, with tight corners. Some displays are too high to see from a wheelchair, but most are at an accessible height. There is lift access to all floors, and the lift is large.
While there are disabled toilets, there is also a full changing place available in the basement.
Considering that ableism is an issue in medicine, the subject of disability was mostly well-handled if under-represented."
5086,It's a traditional pier with an amusement and entertainment complex at the shore end. You can go in and explore but steps at the rear mean you cannot proceed on to the main pier. You have to back track and use a ramp at the side of the building which takes you up on to the pier. Once on the main pier watch out for the gaps in the planking as it's easy to catch a wheel of your chair in the slot. We were able to walk and wheel to the end of the pier. You have to negotiate the array of amusement rides and kiosks.
5087,All staff were friendly. Box office staff very good with advice and info re access etc on the phone.
5088,Staff were ace. 
5089,"All staff are  disabled aware, front of house and bar staff always happy to assist. They will answer any questions and accompany you to your seating area. We have always found them polite and not patronising. "
5090,Very friendly and helpful. I was asked a lot if I was OK. 
5091,Staff were very helpful indeed!
5092,The accessible toilet was fine but would be tight for a power chair user as there was limited side transfer space. Otherwise it was clean and tidy.
5093,Wheelchair access is great and the staff are very friendly and helpful. 
5094,"The entrance to the Old Fortress is step free involves walking on a bridge over an artificial moat. The entrance has a vaulted corridor and 2 rooms on each side which house the Byzantine Collection of Corfu and souvenir shops. Still on the level is the former English Barracks, which now house the Historical Archives of Corfu. I visited the archives and this involved going up a flight of outdoor steps with handrail, see photo, but once inside the public access to the archives is on the same level. Also on the level is St George's Church. built in the style of a Greek temple, but which was unfortunately not open the day I visited. I did notice that there appeared to be a ramp at one side of the church.
The rest of the Fortress complex involves climbing up stairs, see photos. I didn't do this as it wouldn't have managed this but he views from the top are meant to be magnificent."
5095,The outlet shopping centre has good level entry and excellent flooring throughout. Some ramps which are quite steep.
5096,"We visit Highways quite often. Its a good place to buy gifts, with a lovely aquatic section and at Christmas time the lights and decorations are lovely. The access is good with wide automatic doors, wide aisles, and no steps or staircases to negotiate."
5097,There is a large public (free) carcar park opposite the pub. There is some space outside on the road too. 
5098,"Although it's possible to get into the shop, the displays are so crammed together, that it's impossible to get around the shop. Instead of spending my money there, I gave up and left. "
5099,"The waitresses in the cafe at the Philharmonie were frienly and helpful. They explained the meal deal and, though the cafe is self-service, they brought our trays to our tabke."
5100,"There are 2 accessible toilets. There is one near the entrance, which is the one I used. It is in a row with other toilets. I was quite shocked when I went in, see photo. The cubicle was very small. To the right of the toilet was a support beam for the roof and on the left was a free standing baby changing table, which when I tried was too heavy to move. There were 2 grab rails, a drop down one next to the toilet and one behind the toilet and the support beam, so difficult to access. When I returned with Liz, a member of staff with the changing table and 2 of us in the toilet including me and my crutch there was no space.  Liz agreed that the changing table would be moved out later the same day. I agreed I would write my review as it was when I visited, but acknowledge what they were planning to do in my review. The accessible toilet had no emergency cord and there was a communal sink was outside the cubicle with the hand dryer above it.

Liz brought to my attention that there was a second accessible toilet which was located by the bar area. This involved walking the entire length of the corridor and through the bar. This toilet was larger. There were grab rails, a regular sink and a baby changing table in the corner."
5101,Spacious and clean.
5102,"People I met were helpful if asked, but I hardly had need to do so. "
5103,Everything was easy access-wise - from entering the terminal to getting off at the other end. It was inexpensive and the staff were fantastic.
5104,The Broma café has its own large car park with disabled parking spaces and for those using public transport the bus stops are just outside the venue.
5105,This self catering cottage has been made entirely accessible for all including wider doors and rails.
5106,Disabled bays are located at the side and back of theatre with level access 
5107,"Always very attentive and helpful, the staff appear to enjoy working here"
5108,"The theatre is right inside Keble College.  It may be possible to contact the college in advance to reserve college parking, but we didn't have time to do this.  We parked easily on the street outside."
5109,"Great permanent building wise- lifts, loos all great. 

Festival wise - in the ballroom the view for wheelchair users was really bad - felt like seriously second class citizens! Basically had a view of the bottom of the stage as the stage was raised so high so couldnt see what was going on."
5110,Plenty of space to park in a dedicated off road area just yards from the front door.
5111,"Disabled parking right outside reception and near to rooms.
Given 4 stars purely because the 2 spaces provided might prove to be inadequate at busier times in Cornwall. January is not peak season after all and both spaces were in use ( one by us , I hasten to add)"
5112,Parked outside despite it being a weekend.
5113,"venue has plenty of space to embark/disembark. Disabled taxis can be an issue in Dublin because of the traffic, that said, the ones there are are top-notch."
5114,"After walking across the courtyard (care needed on the flagstones) there's a permanent ramp to the front door. Once inside, entrance hall area is tiled. Living room has wooden floor.  Bedrooms carpeted and bathrooms tiled. I used a wheeled walker which was fine  - you might need to be careful with sticks or crutches if any of the floors are wet (eg raining no outside). There are no steps inside at all, just a bit of care needed with a few loose tiles in doorways but nothing major. Sadly no ramp from back door onto patio - a shame as the garden is nice and level with nice patio furniture. I've included a photo do people can see the size of step for themselves.  The kitchen has plenty of work surface, all at regular height. The oven is a low level one. The sofas and chair are quite low and hard to stand up from but there are lots and lots of cushions to prop you up if that helps."
5115,The staff were friendly and helpful. They directed us where to go and how to get tickets.
5116,"The ensuite in the room, was bijou but had everything you need.  The toilet was a bit low for me, but saved by the commode style shower chair.  

Didn't use any other toilet on board. "
5117,"Good wide door, although might need help to open them if you're on your own. 
Corridor starts wide but gets narrower towards the back of the shop. You need to move a seat to get a space for a wheelchair."
5118,"Short ramp up to the door, heavy spring, door only opens half way. I only just got in. Door opens inwards and the toilet is exposed to people on the train platform if carer/assistant exits. No toilet on the farm side of the railway. "
5119,"Clean and gender neutral, if I remember correctly."
5120,"One disabled loo on thee ground floor, I had no issues getting to it, and there were plenty of handholds and rails."
5121,"Those we encountered were great; friendly and helpful, especially in the café. They just need more people around the exhibition area to help with the doors."
5122,This is a great stop while exploring the beautiful island Texel.  Beautiful interactive exhibits have been built to engage people of all ages. Plan to spend approximately two hours.
5123,"This is one fantastic venue from the moment we arrived at the pay in desk nothing was a problem. The member of staff phoned and we were meet by another member of staff who gave there name and escorted us to one of the wet rooms. They told us if there were any problems to let them know strait away.The Sandcastle is kept at a constraint temperature and is always warm. Areas in the venue include a wave pool , A river creek  , as well as a shallow waters area. There are also a number of food out lets available around the venue. This is the place to be on a wet day in Blackpool."
5124,"There is a great accessible toilet in the visitor centre. Lots of turning space, roll under sink and handrails where needed so I could use the space independently. "
5125,"The staff were lovely, but disability awareness was not good. "
5126,This is an amazing festival where it's promises to be as accessible as possible. We ventured down from Edinburgh for the day to see if it delivered and it most definitely did! We're lucky enough to have really  sunny weather too! 
5127,"Largely only accessible by car, I do believe there is an occasional bus service.
As mentioned previously there are two designated disabled parking spaces. There is a large area of tarmac for parking then there is a further area of gravel for parking but this is both difficult to push over and is on a reasonably steep hill."
5128,The access through the hotel was very good. The two lifts were a good size you drove in and backed out. The only disadvantage was the lifts didn't have a mirror on the back wall you could look through to back out.
5129,"There was 3 disabled parking spaces, not very wide like normal disabled spaces, just normal spaces marked out with the wheelchair logo. They weren't close to anything"
5130,The owners of the farm are lovely .  They were always useful when we ask them for advice and very relaxed .
5131,"Was not automatic door, friend had to open for me. Greeter did speak to me and not friends. Was bit cramped journey to table and sat next to drink dispenser so very busy next to us."
5132,Easy access venue including for wheelchairs. Parking at front door for disabled a little restricted but plenty of alternative spaces. Staff very friendly and helpful. Food and service excellent. We eat there regularly and will continue to do so.
5133,"Step free access, but heavy double doors to open to get into the venue. Quite a small place so might be difficult to navigate depending on equipment etc. "
5134,The staff were very friendly and helpful.
5135,"We booked assistance at Reading train station for the 11.50am train
and were told to arrive at least 20 minutes before departure.
Never a family to be late, 
we parked in the disabled parking space at Reading train station 
and had bought our tickets by 11.10am.

We spoke to the man at the barrier and he let us through and said he'd radio for assistance.
We knew we were early and so expected to wait
but only had to wait about 5 minutes and were apologised to several times for that.
We found amazing sign about the station for visually impaired.

The guy who came to assist was friendly and energetic,
he made the whole experience relaxing and fun
and I didn't feel a burden in any way.

He saw that our train was delayed and got us to an earlier train.
This was great, but that train was really busy and we were last on,
having to wait until everyone had cleared space for the ramp to be placed.

The assistance guy was brilliant, he shouted for people to let us on."
5136,Staff were pleasant and unobtrusive. 
5137,"Many parts are accessible but it is an ancient building so some steps to access all rooms. Audio guide in multiple languages, and staff to descr various aspects of the history. "
5138,the disabled parking is on the streets and in a carpark not to far away couple of minutes walking  
5139,"No steps anywhere, quite spacious and large wheelchair bathroom. Lots of low seating."
5140,"Lots of parking around the park edges, close to main road with bus stops too. There are two accessible parking spaces immediately outside the palm house inside the park too. This isn't always open though, so check before you visit!"
5141,See https://www.nufc.co.uk/tickets/stadium-plan for further details 
5142,"I travelled by public transport to Gladstone's and it was easy, cheap and accessible. I travelled by train to Chester. Opposite Chester's train station there is a bus stop S4, next to the Town Crier public house, and from there the 4 and x4 buses to Mold depart and take you to Hawarden.  Buses have one entrance/ exit with a ramp and wheelchair spaces. Buses are about every 30 minutes during the day. I didn't find the service 100% reliable, as the 2pm didn't turn up when I was travelling there and I ended up getting the next bus about 20-30 minutes later. There is a shelter and seating at the bus stop so it was ok. The journey took about 30-40 minutes and the bus driver was helpful and told me when I reached my stop, which is the Glynne Arms. From there it's a five minutes level walk to the Library. On the way back I left earlier to ensure if a bus was cancelled I would catch my train. Again a bus came 20 minutes after I had expected one, and waiting at the bus stop directly outside the Glynne Arms was difficult as there is no seating or shelter. The pub has a low wall, but I would not have been able to get up again. Public transport is a good option but just allow yourself plenty of time to travel in case buses don't turn up as planned.

There is a car park for guests."
5143,Helpful staff.
5144,"A trip to Dobbie’s Garden Centre and Butterfly World makes a worthwhile afternoon outing for everyone. Disabled parking is right by the front entrance and there is plenty of space.
I went specifically to look at the new garden centre, to buy plants, plant pots and compost and to treat my father and me with a cup of coffee and one of their excellent cheese scones.
The plants are all laid out in sections at table height or on the floor. The pots and saucers are also at a height that is accessible for wheelchair users. They also have fantastic table height troughs that could be used as raised beds or for displaying plants in plant pots.
The new cafe is very light and spacious. There are breakfasts and lunches and three coffee and cake areas each with a pay point. The tables have small wooden boxes with cutlery, napkins, sugar and condiments. There is an indoor climbing frame with ball pits for wee ones (£3.50) and an outdoor area for  older kids (free). 
There are also numerous shopping outlets selling clothes and kitchen and household items. Dobbie’s also has a large outlet selling quality butchery,  local vegetables, ready meals, Scottish produce in the delicatessen etc.
There’s also a section selling books, toys, gifts and cards.
The disabled toilets are very well appointed! There is a smaller toilet, a separate children’s nappy changing room and then there is a state of the  art toilet  , which is suitable for anyone (see video).
Staff are friendly and helpful, there to help you with whatever you may want or need."
5145,Staff are very welcoming and helpful 
5146,fully accessible
5147,"I didn’t find the staff overly helpful and the accessible room was rather tight, especially in bathroom.  There wasn’t a lot of room in the lift.  Getting from the Carpark to the entrance was also a bit of a challenge with parked vehicles and a narrow pathway.  Wasn’t able to use the pool either. "
5148,"Its close to Elm Row bus stop (3 minute walk), OMNI (2 Minute walk) York Place (3 minute walk). It is on the corner of a busy round about so that could be a problem for some people. Its close to the last tram stop on York Place. And theres a taxi rank at OMNI."
5149, Very accessible. Most of the museum if flat with wide doors. Lovely shop too and it is roomy enough for a wheelchair user to be comfortable
5150,A car park and bus stops are 2 minutes away.
5151,Not good we parked and walked to the venue
5152,I booked early March for stay on 26th April. I requested a disabled accessible room which was shown on my booking confirmation. When we arrived I was told there had been a mistake and the room was actually upstairs. They said they only had one ground floor room already occupied. The web site mentioned ground floor rooms (plural) with disabled access. We had to wait in draughty area for 30 minutes for mistake to be confirmed then had to return home without even a cup of tea.Very disappointed and a bit upset at their lack of understanding that a flight of stairs are NOT accessible.
5153,"Easily accessible, clean loos, with room for carer if necessary. Not a Changing Places toilet."
5154,There are 4 parking spaces outside Costa but you can't always guarantee there'll be any free and it means going on the road to get onto the pavement. There is a public car park 3 mins away and is free for badge holders.
5155,"Great access, great facilities and great fun!"
5156,The owner (for it was she) was friendly and welcoming.
5157,"For every bad point, the staff made up for it. I got into the coffee shop and I was away to order and the waitress said I can go and find my table and she would bring my biscuit and coffee over if that would be more helpful so I said yes please so I got a table and told the waitress what I would so I ordered and waitress brought over my coffee and biscuit. The staff also looked happy to be working there so the staff helped heaps :) So nice and helpful :)   "
5158,Friendly and very helpful.
5159, The staff here were absolutely great. I phoned ahead to discuss the access and they were really sensible about it. When I got there they couldn’t have been kinder. I was really impressed. They were young too. 
5160,Street parking outside. MIF Staff told us where parking was before the event and how to access the venue.
5161,There are quite a lot of disabled parking spaces around the city centre outside the Indoor Market there are 4 spaces and just round the corner.   ( facing Bath Abbey ) there are three good spaces .....Public transport is mostly wheelchair friendly. Also some taxis have ramps ... Bath Railway Station has two spaces for disabled badge holders.... The station has good access
5162,No steps leading into cafe. Non automatic door for enterance which you have to pull towards you to enter. Signage for ground floor toilet could be better (it's back left from the tills). There is an upstairs seating area which can be accessed via stairs (no lift) but there is limited seating on the ground floor. No induction loop. No alternative reading formats but quite big writing. Certain stock is high and would be out of reach for a wheelchair user (would need someone to reach for you).
5163,"There's a low threshold with a small ramped entrance (see photo). Inside there's a smooth wooden floor. There's room to get a wheelchair through the door, I would think (though I was on foot today) and definitely room for one at the tables by the window. As it's narrower at the rear, a wheelchair wouldn't fit there - however most of the tables are towards the front.  As the loo's right at the back, it's a bit tight getting through on crutches but definitely possible with care."
5164,We travelled by car so can't comment on public transport.  20 disabled parking spaces in front of the visitor centre. Free parking for members of National Trust for Scotland 
5165,Disabled access is very good. Signs are large and almost every door has automatic buttons. The building is all on one level and has lots of facilities available. There are however no automatic doors to the charging room and once in the changing rooms there could be a problem pushing eg a wheelchair as there are benches in the way.
5166,"As this was a connecting flight cannot comment on the transport, staff supportby the Airport staff was excellent. There were fully serviced and accessible areas throughout, wide spacious aisles."
5167,"Very professional and helpful, they tend to have staff on each floor to assist on any need that you might have."
5168,"Lots of space and room round tables, bar quite high"
5169,All the staff were fantastic ! My mother as well as being physically disabled has dementia and they were all lovely to her.
5170,"Clear signage to public toilets, including disabled."
5171,Tram lines serving the eastern and southern outskirts of the city and some suburbs further out offer a regular service and ease of access. As on all public transport in Paris you need to be aware of pickpockets.
5172,"The bar is tucked away on the main square. At one side of the square there is the Town Hall Tower, see photo. Make for this and look for a branch of Starbucks (2019) which is on a street corner of the Old Town Square and Swietej Anny. Facing Starbucks with your back to the main square, there is a doorway on the right which leads into a small courtyard. Walk into the courtyard and then on your right hand side you will see the entrance to the bar. There are a couple of free standing tables and chairs outside. 

The bar is in the basement, down one flight of stairs with a handrail. On entering the building the lighting levels are lower than outside. There is a bar which is at standing height and there are several small rooms off it with free standing tables and chairs. Some dining chairs, others soft armchairs. There is a separate room where they have their cabaret on Saturday evenings.  "
5173,"What a cool place! Great 'looking' place and food, no idea what it tastes like.  I was so excited that my friend wanted to visit this place. We booked it as one wheelchair but when we turned up, the step had one side larger than the other and wheel could not get up the steeper side! people on the street tried to help, whilst the staff looked on. They do have a side door but it leads directly on to the cellar steps, so again, too tight a corner to risk an electric wheelchair. After 20 mins or so of embarrassment for everyone involved, we had to give up in the rain. It seems that all the cool people don't use wheelchairs and haven't thought about the ones that do!"
5174,"Homelands is situated in a lovely spot with access to the little villages of the beautiful East Neuk of Fife.  
The lodges are fully accessible for people with all levels of disability’s.  They are fitted with wet rooms, hoists and specialised beds.  Each lodge has its own patio with lovely views.  They are well equipped and the staff are lovely and helpful.
 "
5175,I have a severely disabled son in a wheelchair and also a sin with severe autism. We love going here so must review it for everyone....but there are wheelchair access issues. Staff are excellent.
5176,Good accessible toilet in the Bistro.
5177,"Of the 5 destinations, Barcelona was the only one that had wheelchair accessible taxis. Other than that, disabled passengers must be able to climb onto a coach. Electric wheelchairs can not be taken on tour excursions, unless by pure luck the coach has a wheelchair lift. Cannes is a tender port, which means the disabled passenger must be able to walk steps with assistance. To have wheelchair friendly transport on tour excursions, the tour operators must be informed well in advance, and passengers may be asked to pay an extortionate fee for a 'medivan' - I was quoted $900 for a return trip."
5178,"We drove, as it is a countryside location (I doubt there is any public transport to such an area).

There were disabled parking spaces right by the front entrance, properly marked on both sides for full access. 
Getting to the entrance was easy as the short roll to the door was nice & level, and the surface indoors was what us wheelies love - perfectly smooth and and very easy to traverse. "
5179,"Tony Macaroni is an Italian restaurant within Silverburn shopping center. Being in a shopping center it has level access and no doors to enter the restaurant, perfect for anybody with mobility issues."
5180,The staff where not very helpful and not answer our questions
5181,"nice place, welcoming and friendly
lots to do and see
"
5182,They were helpful if not a little brisk!
5183,"On my recent visit to Morrison's in York, I was made aware of the facilities for people with disabilities. I was pleasantly surprised with the extent of the facilities available. On entering the premises I noticed level access and automatic doors. Ramps and slopes were present for individuals such as wheelchair users and a mobility impaired walker was also on the premises. Around the shop there was chairs, which would prove helpful for people who may become tired easily while grocery shopping."
5184,All coaches involved in the advantage tennis programme are friendly and supportive. They are attentive and conscious of the factors to be considered when working with individuals with a disability. I feel that they are keen to go the extra mile to ensure each individual gets the most from the sessions. They make it a great environment to be a part of. 
5185,"Arriving into Bank DLR station it all looks like a fairly standard underground style station.

Hunting around and following the signs I found the lift. Naively thinking this would be easy I squeezed in the rather tight lift - good job my powerchair is not too big at 68 cm wide.

The next level wasn't the way out and was not well signposted so I followed the crowd to find yet another lift; bigger this time!

The next level wasn't the street level either! A hunt down a long corridor and I found the last lift. At last the way out ..."
5186,"Very friendly and knowledgeable particularly as it is his own privately built-up collection, and he makes a good cup of tea."
5187,Glasshouse Cafe staff very pleasant and provided ramp and moved furniture to enable me to reach a comfortable table. Would not be a good pace to go when busy. The outside cafe (not open all year so check the website) is much more spacious.
5188, Staff are friendly and all offered to help with my shopping
5189,Usual disabled toilets for people who are able to self-transfer
5190,disabled toilet on the ground floor. with hoist and changing bed
5191,"Cafe with view over iconic Castle Stalker (itself one of the least accessible places).   
Disabled parking by door.  
Disable toilets.  
Level access throughout cafe and shop.   Routes through shop with wheelchair could be usefully wider.   Have to rearrange chairs in this busy cafe.   Nice outside area.
Decent disabled toilet."
5192,"Dedicated disabled parking spaces near the entrance. Bus stop right at the door, literally 2 minutes off the M8 motorway"
5193,"I attended this venue on the 8th of March 2022 with a companion who is confined to a wheelchair. On the door of the premises there is a round blue circle with a wheel chair inside circle press here for help it says. We did but we’re told that it’s not wheelchair accessible. So I pointed out the circle and said why that if not accessible. He said there’s no place to put a ramp and that was the end of that spoil the day completely I did complain to Costa I got offered a free drink.
"
5194,"The Gallery section of the shop has a door to the main street which was wide and level enough to simply wheel in. Once inside there a great open space where every in of wall space displays the various pieces of artwork for sale.

Plenty of room for more than one wheelchair to get in and move around."
5195,Arrived by car. Several disabled parking spaces right in front of main reception. Others at the back of the main building.
5196,St. Paul's as an older building has worked hard to make as much accessible as possible. The experience was great and the staff extremely helpful.
5197,"Nice food, good site, great place to go on a sunny day."
5198,"it's next to quite a few bus stops and there is on road disabled parking nearby, but be warned! you have to drive down a bus lane to get to them! you are allowed to do it with a blue badge but you will get a ticket and need to prove you have a valid blue badge... They've told us we're ""on the list now"" but we've had 5 tickets this year *eye roll*"
5199,"Great staff, friendly and helpful."
5200,Nice big clean modern accessible loo with all the rails I needed.
5201,"Surprising great, it is a historical building and so the restrictions are huge, but they have worked awfully hard to make it accessible :) hence 4 stars "
5202,There seemed ample staff there and they were very friendly and accessible.
5203,Friendly and helpful staff particularly in the cafe area.
5204,"A great day out with lots of facilities to visit including cafés, shops, a small farm, small maze and a section Wentworth gardens. Levelled grounds allow easy maneuver wheelchairs. Disabled parking is available towards the entrance of the garden centre."
5205,"We found all the staff we dealt with to be very willing and supporting, helping us all the way."
5206,"The entrance is step free and the café is all on the ground level. The café is self service and the counter is at standing height. There is an eclectic assortment of free standing tables, chairs, arm chairs and sofas. "
5207,"All staff were extremely helpful from the time we arrived, to make sure we understood the access provisions"
5208,"Parking off street, CCTV, limited to 2hrs.  Bus stop on both side of the street - traffic light controlled, drop kerbs. Ramp/steps from the street."
5209,"Clean and plenty of space, accessible loos need a radar key."
5210,Large car park adjacent to the hotel but only one disabled space allocated close to the flat paving stones which run around the hotel many other parking spaces but this means crossing uneven cobbles. There are bus stops not far from the hotel and many taxis passing regulate.
5211,"Delicious food and drinks, friendly staff, great access. Restaurant is overlooking the centre's outdoor fountain area"
5212,"The London Palladium is a beautiful venue and has a lot of wheelchair spaces and seats for users who can transfer which is great since it does have some excellent productions. However, access to the stalls is via lift (one at a time) and there is just on wheelchair accessible toilet for 10 plus users. Staff were unhelpful which is rare at a London theatre venue. After being shown to out seats/space we were told staff would help with drinks etc and no one came to see us before the show or during the interval. It was a scrum during the interval to reach or use the one very dirty toilet."
5213,"The one 'disabled' toilet is small. I couldn't fit my power chair in as the doorway was too narrow. The door itself is highly sprung and heavy, which is impossible to use if on your own. There is a weird all in one metal rail that runs from the toilet along the length of the facility. It blocks the sink off too! There are multiple boxed in pipes and so it is very small. The toilet is low down and there is no easy way of getting up. The sink is so small and inaccessible. To dry your hands there is a blue paper towel dispenser. "
5214,Proper Accessible Accomodation that was throughly thought through and clearly planned out.
5215,"An accessible toilet is located just off the main concourse. A quick enquiry at the information desk and they will tell you where it is. The door has a RADAR key, it is super spacious, has grab rails, and is clean and tidy."
5216,Easy access into building through pavement level entrance.
5217,"Decent size, doubles as baby change. No red cord."
5218,"Green Park station is 0.8 miles away and fully step free, but check before you travel, the lifts at this station are notoriously and disgracefully unreliable. 

Tottenham Court Road station is much closer, and fully step-free (contact staff at the ticket barrier if you want to travel on the Central Line as they have to deploy a ramp manually), but check before you travel, the lifts at this station are notoriously and disgracefully unreliable. 

Many buses serve nearby Oxford Street.

I don't know about parking in Soho."
5219,There was a flight of steps but these were accessed via a 'lift'. This was essentially a lift on the tracks of a tank!
5220,"Small car park with one disabled space. If you're lucky enough to get that place, then access good. Otherwise a bit of a struggle as limited street parking. Bus stop nearby."
5221,"Really liked the boats inside, and good lifts, plus people in wheelchairs can visit a variety of shops and the cinema. It’s quite a loud place so not great for people who are sensitive to noise and crowds."
5222,"Access around the harbour and beach is great in North Berwick. The Beach Hut with beach wheelchairs is right nearby too! The Lobster Shack is a great place to pick up some food to go, and there are tables and chairs (some of the chairs are moveable to allow access for wheelchair users) nearby or you can take your seafood away to any of the nooks and crannies around the harbour."
5223,"Steady ramps throughout. The only minor barrier to access was on some of the immaculately preserved railway passenger coaches. As expected the doors simply weren't designed to accommodate wheelchairs. Though if you can leave your wheelchair or can walk with assistance, there's a small steps into each of the coaches. Other than that the overall access means that anyone can get up close to all the exhibits - interaction seems encouraged with all sorts of railway paraphernalia for visitors to pick up and play with."
5224,"Disabled parking outside the door worked well for us, even though we need space to make an exit from the passenger door. There is sufficient flat space to park but it is at the top of a steep bank.
You need a car to get to Hoe Grange."
5225,Gaynor and Julie are great
5226,Some access issues but this was made clear before entry and staffveryhelpful
5227,"Skiing in Scotland's own winter wonderland!
An outdoor adventure with fantastic scenary and friendly people. 
May need to do some advance planning to get the most from it."
5228,Purpose built and fully accessible
5229,their is 2 accessible toilets one of them is a changing places toilet 
5230,"No car parks immediately nearby, but some disabled parking is available within a 1 mile radius.
There are plenty of nearby bus stops."
5231,The parking is in the Clocktower Business Park car park . The two trampers are kept in a shed adjacent to the car park. There is no public transport to this venue
5232,"I travel by public transport so the location was ideal. Princes Street is well served by buses to loads of destinations, a railway station across the road from the hotel and a tram stop just around the corner in St Andrew Square."
5233,No problems with anything.
5234,"Great accessible loo, which had everything I needed and is quite spacious."
5235,Quite poor signage to the accessible toilets. 
5236,"Staff were fantastic, coping with the stress of a busy lunchtime with their COVID precautions , explained all the procedures, and were very kind and helpful"
5237,"Parking is available at the ground and in the street's around the ground there is also a Taxi rank and a local tour bus that runs from Albert Dock Area to the ground at the gates to the stadium . 
A number of local buses also stop at the stadium or near to the stadium its self  "
5238,"The bathroom in the accessible room was ideal. There was a low-sided bath. But I did need help with the toilet rail - it was a little too heavy to move into 'down' position, but no problem when I asked receptionist (Keeley). Reception was very close-by."
5239,"This trip was my first ever ferry ride, so didn't really know what to expect.  The staff made everything super easy from the moment we arrived at the security gate.  I was given a special hanger for my car to show I needed wheelchair access and we were guided onboard to park right next to the lift. 

Once up on the accommodation deck the lovely reception people showed me to by cabin, which had the coolest automatic open/close door!!  The cabin was specifically wheelchair accessible, but as I have an electric wheelchair is was a little snug, no drama's though we shoved it in the shower.  I struggle with low toilets, which this was, but helpfully the shower chair doubled up as a commode, popped it over the loo and boom, sorted.

The lift is ok, again a little snug but I guess they need all the space they can get.  Would fit one wheelchair with a helper and luggage.

The upper deck where the lounges are is very spacious, plenty room to drive a wheelchair around.  In the Magnus lounge (we had special passes) there's a lot of chair and tables, but the staff are more than happy to move stuff around to get you in. Soft drinks and snacks were free, you can also have dinner and breakfast there too.  Food is ok, nothing to blow your mind but nice wholesome dishes - Fish & Chips, Macaroni Cheese etc."
5240,"The hotel has a carpark and 1 accessible Parking space which can be booked if the hotel is given prior notice. If this space is taken, there is also space in the courtyard behind the hotel that can be used."
5241,Helpful & friendly.
5242,The staff were very helpful and pleasant to deal with.
5243,The staff answered all questions that we had about accessibility. They can't be blamed for the oversight of head office management.  
5244,"The front door has a very tall, steep and slippery hump. It is extremely difficult and annoying trying to get a wheelchair or powerchair over this hump, and in wet weather impossible, because it's shiny, and slippery when wet.

The doorbell button is much too high up on the doorframe and almost impossible for most wheelchair-users to use.

Worse still, the reception staff cannot hear the doorbell because it's located in some remote part of the building at the back, so I am often left waiting outside in the cold, or I have to bang on the door - because it's not possible to even attempt to get inside without someone holding the door open.

Once you're inside, it's all fine, there's room to manoeuvre and even with my chunky powerchair I can get into all the examination and treatment rooms."
5245,"Overall impressive.

There appears to be 2 or 3 entrances to the complex. Look out for the small, white ticket offices, at standing height. I went to the first one I came to and  it only had stairs, with a hand rail and the person suggested I might want to use the 2nd entrance along as it had ramp and stairs access. There is a  sculpture called Barlovento, just by the entrance.  I have posted a photo of the step free entrance, so you know what to look out for. When I visited there were no queues. 

If you use the step free entrance there is a special area reserved for disabled people almost immediately in front and a step free, sloping entrance to one of the pools. It was here I saw the aqua wheelchair, which I also photographed.

The complex itself is very large and spacious. There are about 7 pools to swim in, I think the majority of the pools are accessible by steps without hand rails. There are lots of ramps as well as stairs to access the main areas and facilities. However there are some terraced areas which are only accessible by steps without handrails, however, with my crutch I found these managable. The island bar is only accessible by crossing a small bridge with 2 steps up and then 2 steps down, the bridge is made of planks of wood so I had to position my crutch so it didn't get caught in the gaps."
5246,Presume this is good
5247,Great services off A34 north. Accessible food store and coffee shop. 
5248,Accessible toilets on the ground floor needing lift therefore if you are in Casino or private function rooms but the toilet that I visited was well kitted out though probably not that large. It was clean tidy and uncluttered
5249,"There is only one fully fitted disabled toilet within the cafe this is fitted with handrails, a low sink and a low pull light switch. A disadvantage to the facility is that it is situated after a partitioning wall and a drinks fridge which reduces the accessibility to the toilet. Upon reaching the toilet door there is a large low door handle on both sides and an easy low lock."
5250,"Betty's famous tearooms with a lovely view over the gardens.
You don't have to go in the garden to visit Betty's,  although if you do there is also a Betty's half way around with out door seating only."
5251,Friendly and helpful staff.
5252,"Main Entrance has a Large revolving door which can be slowed down and stopped for disabled access using dedicated button
All floors accessible by lift
One way system in place with COVID restrictions on stairwells, clearly signposted
Plenty of seating in foyer to rest, some areas are quite a walk for those with walking difficulties, but if you ask at the desk in the foyer, they will summon a volunteer to help you with a chair, and plenty of chairs available in the foyer, if you have someone to help you.
Good signage, plenty regarding COVID safety measures, signage is much improved from when it was the main hospital
Main sign includes information regarding where disabled toilets are allocated"
5253,There is one accessible toilet on the first floor which is clean and well-maintained.
5254,There is quite a  large car park with stunning sea views over the Forth. There are disabled spaces. The only problem is that  you need to negotiate a very rough cobbled road to get to the Harbourmaster's House from the car park. There is some parking on the hill next to the Harbourmaster's House but you will need to be lucky to get a spot there.
5255,There is level access. A good quality toilet (which may not have a hoist). It is no difference whether I come in to eat when compared to anybody else. They want my family and I to have a good time and more to the point I don't have to worry at all.
5256,First class. Modern and clean. Good circulation space and transfer either side. Red cord in order. 
5257,"It is not often I write these reviews but after travelling around Europe for the past 3 month I have to say this little hotel is by far exceptional. The location is very central close to lots of reasonable eateries, particular the one opposite, real goo value for money. Location wise its in the heart of the city close to 2 metro station which will take you to all of the cities attractions. The hotel itself is small but big on personality. the rooms are spotlessly clean, comfortable and with the  present weather the air con is excellent. The breakfast is outstanding with a full range, nobody will start the day hungry. The best thing about the hotel is with out doubt the staff, helpful , charming and went the extra mile to welcome me, I felt like a movie star. In closing I have to me the say the reception staff were exceptional in particular Anca our breakfast lady was wonderful. Thank you so much Monsieur Cadet.

My sincere best wishes
Ken Abbott (the man with the hat)"
5258,Antiquated but adequate. There was even an adult changing bed. Like something from “Carry on Matron”. 
5259,"engaged and helpful, let me say what help I needed and were happy to comply."
5260,"There are a number of Blue badge spaces located in the car park under the store. These are on the left hand side as you drive in to the car par.  
There is good lighting in this area and normal plenty of people around during the day time. 
As with all the parking in the store car park it is meant to be for Customers only and there is a time limit set as well if you are over the time you will be fined. This is operated by a private company for Asda."
5261,Good sized accessible loo on the cafe side on the ground floor. Not sure about elsewhere.
5262,As a former Landscape Architect I love the Botanics and even more so that the do their best ensure accessibility is high on their agenda! 
5263,"The Post Office was entered via level access and automatic doors. Once inside,  it is extremely spacious. To get served you must first choose a service that's required on a machine that will give out a numbered ticket. Wait until the number is called out and what desk you go to and the assistant will deal with you. This can be anything from buying stamps or package weighing, to getting a passport, travel insurance or currency. For those needing photos for passports/driving licenses there is a wheelchair accessible photo booth where the assistants will help."
5264,Easy to find with owners directions. Parking outside the chalet
5265,"Staff were friendly and welcoming. Food was ordered at the bar and then served at your table. As a solo traveller with a visable mobilty disability I found it difficult to get from my table to the bar due to the seating layout. It would have been nice if the bar staff had been a bit more proactive and more disabled aware by maybe offering me table service, and as a result of that after having my main course I decided not to go up to the bar and back again to order a dessert or more drinks as it was a bit of a hassle to ask 2 or 3 tables if they could move so I could get through to the bar, so I just left. This is a very personal observation and it wouldn't stop me going back to the pub again, it would have just been helpful. Next time I'd try to arrive earlier so I have the option of more free tables and pick one with earier access to the bar."
5266,"What was relevant to us was the access to a lift if the stairs were difficult, also large open spaces can be daunting but it wasn't the case here. The lift and toilets were clearly visible and access in, out and around the gallery was good."
5267,"The Photography Museum is named after Charles Nègre, a pioneering French photographer. The museum is housed in 2 separate buildings next to each other, one is a gallery which houses temporary exhibitions and the smaller building is the museum. When I visited in December 2019 the temporary exhibition was about Guy Bourdin, a French fashion and advertising photographer, and is on until 26th January 2020. It's a small but very accessible museum. I really enjoyed it. It one of the hidden gems of Nice."
5268,"This 2 bedroom cottage is situated in the courtyard directly opposite the castle. The courtyard is cobbled stone and there is a parking space at the door. Entrance is via a small, but slightly steep ramp to a double doorway. Rooms are a good size, particularly one of the bedrooms, and all have a red emergency chord in. There is also a visual alarm on the ceiling that light up in each room.
The kitchen, although spacious, is not particularly made any more accessible than standard kitchens. The bathroom is large with a roll in shower and a bath."
5269,"Very very friendly and helpful, also very quick service"
5270,"A steep road down to the harbour, accessible by vehicle but would need a good powerchair/scooter to do it, a manual chair would struggle a lot. There is limited parking. Level surface either concrete or tarmac but intended harbour edges. You can also follow an access road along the bay to a small hamlet of fishing cottages. A lovely place for a mooch about!"
5271,There were lots of lifts and room to move. It is also easy to reach the clothes but some are harder.
5272,Fully accessible
5273,They all went out of their way to help you and this is so different from British Rail. there are refreshments on the train as well
5274,The accessible bathroom was really good. Plenty of space to move around with my powerchair. Good fittings and everything with easy reach.
5275,"The Starbucks coffee shop on Canongate is a sweet spot for people watching. Situated along the busy street you can watch the world go by and be comfortable knowing there are accessible toilet facilities, space to relax, move around, and the staff are lovely!"
5276,Accessible toilets are available at the Westgate multistory carpark
5277,Staff are not particularly friendly or helpful - some are nicer than others.
5278,"I booked a 6 hour private taxi tour of Corfu island with Dimitris Dafnis. I booked with him as he was the only taxi tour website for Corfu which mentioned disability. The tour was amazing and explored the less touristy sights on the island. We went to the beach, into the hills where we had wonderful views and visited lots of villages. In the one day I felt I had seen so much of the island and had learnt about the history, culture and local life. Highly recommend this tour."
5279,Staff is very good and attentive.
5280,"A gentle ramp takes you to the door. Inside the hotel there are no trip hazards or steps between the restaurant, bar or accessible bedrooms."
5281,"There is but one toilet and it is equipped with grab rails etc which is great. However the push button flush was broken so very hard to use and the hand drier was on the other side of the room with no grab rails to help me reach it, let alone balance by it!   The loo had a clear sign outside indicated it was accessible."
5282,The store was well laid out with displays around the outside walls. There was a lot of space to move my chair and I did notice an induction loop sign on the window.
5283,From the minute we meet the staff at the lift they were very helpful and friendly and talked away to us very happily  the staff will also let you know when the show or holograms are going to be on and will do what they can to assist you during your visit . 
5284,"Completely accessible cottage for elderly lady  with wheelchair and zimmer frame.  Great wet room with loads of space and all the equipment.  Lovely comfortable accommodation upstairs for rest of family.  Jayne and Richard couldn't have been more helpful with information.  Well-equipped kitchen, Sainsbury's few minutes drive away.  Lots to do in the local area, which we already knew well but could not have come to on this occasion without the accessibility offered by Summerfield Farm."
5285,Great ramp up into the shop. The tearoom is quite tight but chairs can be moved.
5286,"Flat access into the restaurant, it’s not very big but was easy enough for me in my electric wheelchair."
5287,"The accessible bedroom had a bath, in spite of my stating my need for a roll-in shower. Such rooms do exist but I can't advise how to ensure you get one."
5288,I saw a sign for accessible loo but didn't use it
5289,The venue has plenty of parking. Being at the heart of the West End there are plenty of buses from the city center.
5290,"We went by car, I don't think it would be easy via public transport due to location. Disabled parking out the front."
5291,Sidmouth doesn't have a train station but is do-able on public transport. There are step free buses from Exeter (9 or 9A) and the journey time is about 30 - 45 minutes. 
5292,Plenty of space for parking on hard standing outside the cottages.
5293,"The Stadium has great access and the wheelchair seats have a superb view of the field and track.   Loos are clearly marked and well equipped.  The Park is beautiful and has lovely smooth paths, with lots of seating at regular intervals."
5294,"Large and clean accessible toilet, in reception area, in the corner by the lifts. No key required. There were grab rails. The emergency code didn't reach to the ground. The lighting went on automatically when you went in and went off after about 4 - 5 minutes, but easily came back on when I moved my head/ arms."
5295,"Unusual offices based in the Mansfield Traquar Centre, an old church. Accessible once you know how."
5296,"Lots of buses, parking not so good, accessible toilet cabin, staff very helpful"
5297,"There is a ramped entrance to go into the visitors centre. The cafe area is quite small, but there is enough room to navigate through the tables and staff are always happy to help to move furniture. "
5298,Excellent staff. Worth a visit for the more mobile 
5299,"Level exhibition areas, ramp access inside and a lift."
5300,Quite a few reserved on street parking places for disabled drivers on the side roads off Deansgate.
5301,NA - Unfortunately there are no disabled toilets nearby and a local pub/resturant would need to be found. The closes of which would be in York Centre
5302,The disabled access toilet was easy to find and clearly signed. It large enough for a wheelchair user and a carer. It was clean and there were grab rails. 
5303,"Good access, plenty of wheelchair room inside restaurant"
5304,"The entrance to The White Goose is level access, there is also a little outdoor seating area at the entrance. You are greeted with double door as you enter however, they have to be opened manually. As you enter the restaurant there isn’t that much space to move around. As far as I could see there are about 10 or 11 table however, it would quite difficult to get to some of them. You can see roughly the table layout in pictures below, I would definitely suggest if you are a wheelchair user that you should book a table beforehand and I’m glad we did.

I would say that the tables are at a good height for wheelchair users, just not spaced out that well. Another thing I was impressed with was the plates that we had our meals on, the sides were raised quite high which meant I found it easier to get food on my fork. See image below."
5305,"There is no step at the entrance, the dance fool is all on one level, there is a raised platform for seating and no accessible toilets.  This place gets very bud, but it wasn't too busy this weekend. The bar can get really busy but a wee tip is to order at the bar, go outside to the back entrance and then join your mates on the dance floor without trying to get across the dancehall. This all depends on the weather."
5306,there is a disabled toilet bit basic but does the job
5307,Patronising and completely unhelpful and unwelcoming!
5308,Everyone was nice and freindly. 
5309,"Staff were exceptional. There were 2 members of staff at the entrance way to welcome and assist. The shop/ ticket counter was well staffed and queueing times were short, although it was very busy. There were staff around the museum. 

Special thanks to Tilly who took the Archives Tour, for being extremely engaging and knowledgeable. The tour was suitable for both children and adults, as it was made fun and interactive.

The staff in the restaurant were lovely, when I couldn't get a seat in the restaurant they volunteered to take my tray through to the Children's Eating Room. 

Throughout the day there were numerous children's activities which involved the staff, but I didn't partake in these.

It was so lovely that all the staff were welcoming, helpful and engaging. "
5310,Step free from street. Toilet is to the left of the serving  area and left under the Toilets sign.
5311,Roll in shower with grab rails etc.
5312,"Just one disabled parking space, but close to the entrance."
5313,Access on to and off the Jubilee Line tube trains was fairly OK. You get used to the small gap and often step like access. I found it manageable as a powerchair user.
5314,"Friendly without being intrusive. Good advice regarding accessible restaurants, places to go and useful website."
5315,Small car park with no designated disabled parking
5316,B&Q staff actively involved with monitoring blue badge bays. Just mention that you've seen an abuser and they will sort it.
5317,There were no staff there on this occasion when we visited as the visitor centre was closed hopefully as this is re-staffed again they will perhaps be more volunteers on the site of the abbey to tell people more about its history as I think that would be very interesting
5318,Everything chocolate but literally chokka block with tables.  The hot chocolate is to die for and the cakes are spectacular and the staff are really friendly.  but there is no way you could get any wheelchair or scooter into the café.  I had to leave my scooter outside and struggle inside with my stick to see the cakes.
5319,"Probably the best festival for disabled people and their carers in the world. Free carer tickets, excellent level access disabled parking and campsite, amazingly nice volunteer stewarding, disabled access platforms, the list goes on and on."
5320,"Despite having gone out of their way to make the building accessible corridors, entrance and toilet are narrow. Thanks to staff for great attitude and help though. Also carers go free which is great and disability discount applies too."
5321,Not really much there. 
5322,Ramps at the back to get to the cottage and everything on one level.
5323,There is disabled parking at a car park about a 5/10 minute walk from the entrance. There is a pavement all the way to the entrance so you can push a wheelchair there. The issue we had with our group is that if someone isn’t using a wheelchair but struggles with mobility it can be difficult. When we arrived back after the boat trip we brought the cars right outside to pick our group up but it is worth contacting the venue to check this is ok.
5324,"
Both NTS and Galvanizers staff were lovely, helpful, welcoming and accessible if I needed them; I almost felt like a VIP and they struck just the right balance for me.  They made the whole experience even better."
5325,We travelled to the cottage by car and parked in its car park. This was right next to the cottage and had a tarmac surface. Access to the cottage was along a paved patio to a level threshold entrance.
5326,Loving the new drop off ramp! Makes such a difference! If you’re not being dropped off then definitely use the George Street crossing to get across to Charlotte Square as the pavements are pretty vicious elsewhere!
5327,"H & M store on Sauchiehall Street has restricted access, HOWEVER, there is an accessible door at the entrance at Buchanan Gallerias beside the shop which you can use and there is an accessible entrance into the shop from there. The majority of the shop is accessible, however there are some rails in a position which could cause difficulty maneuvering around the shop. There is also large disabled fitting room facilities for you to use which are incredibly accessible."
5328,good attentive service
5329,All staff helpful
5330,"Easy to use, clean and a good size."
5331,"Inside the main entrance to the Odeon it is very spacious and the doors to enter are automatic doors which makes access easier, the doors to exit at the other side are not automatic but other visitors hold the door open for me and I can go over to the automatic doors if I want to.

As I said the main entrance is spacious and the there is plenty of space to collect pre ordered tickets or queue to buy your tickets. The only thing I would say is after buying my tickets I always have to be careful reversing my powerchair as there isn’t much room when people are queuing behind you, I don’t want to run over anyone.

The only main problem I have at the Odeon is that it isn’t all on the one level, I have to use a lift to go up to the screens. I get anxious sometimes wherever I have to use a lift places in case there’s a fire or it breaks. I feel the lift at the Odeon can be a bit dodgy sometimes, the doors don’t always open when you get up and you have to press the button again. I have also heard it’s been broken occasionally, luckily, I’ve not been there when it has. The lift isn’t the most spacious one I’ve seen, but I have managed to fit in it in my powerchair and with 3 other people.

Upstairs is also very spacious and there are double doors leading to the screens at either side. I’ve noticed though there are new runners on the carpets which feel like mini speed bumps and means I can’t go fast, although maybe that’s a good thing.

There are two types of cinema screens in regard to accessible seating, there are screens where the accessible seating areas are right at the front and other screens have their accessible seating area are a few rows back. I don’t really like the fact that I have to sit near the front, although I love to go to the cinema too much not to go."
5332,"There is a dedicated RADAR key toilet right next to the wheelchair seating area on the left-hand side (as you look at the stage). It is a great toilet because there is never a queue as nobody else can use it, only RADAR keyholders.
If you are seated in the wheelchair area on the right-hand side of the stage you will have to go all the way across because there is only one disabled toilet."
5333,"Everything is one one level, so no stairs or lifts needed. Some ramps (eg from the restaurant) are quite steep and our wheelchair footrests scraped on the ground at the bottom. Throughout the farm site surfaces were concrete but had some gaps and edges causing the wheelchairs front wheels to catch. It was a cold wet day when we visited and the sand/gravel paths round the fields were difficult.
It’s a great place for kids to see and interact with animals, with lots of play areas, though we think that disabled kids would be frustrated by the lack of play areas that they would be able to use."
5334,"http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/fans/disabled-supporters/ 
Details in depth."
5335,"Step-free access to the cathedral is via a passageway off the high street. I was able to get around all the lower areas of the cathedral easily in my wheelchair. But the raised east end of the cathedral is currently only accessible via a flight of stairs. A lift is promised, but work has stalled because in digging a lift shaft to the crypt they came across a Norman wall, which apparently - although it has been invisible for centuries - is suddenly more important than access for today's living people. Most annoying."
5336,We got the train into Glasgow Queen Street and it is about 10 mins walk from there - very near to the Modern Art Gallery. There are some public car parks nearby that have blue badge spaces.
5337,"The front door at Clober Farm is opened electronically by using a key fob card outside and an automatic button on the inside. The front door is very wide for a wheelchair user to get through and the accommodation is all level access.

The living room and kitchen area are open spaced meaning that it is spacious for wheelchair users to move around, there is a dining room table that is at a perfect height for wheelchairs. In the kitchen everything is at a perfect height and there is an adjustable worktop in the kitchen to allow visitors of any height to prepare food.

There are 3 bedrooms at Clober Farm, but only one with a ceiling tracking hoist. This is the bedroom that I slept in due to requiring a hoist and it also had an adjustable bed identical to the one that I use at home, which goes up to save my helper straining her back when assisting me and allows me to raise the head and feet of the bed myself to lie more comfortably. All of the beds in fact allowed visitors to raise their feet and head.

I was able to get into every room, however the bedroom that I was in was very spacious. A feature that I loved in the accessible bedroom and in the kitchen/living area was the assistive technology panels. They allow visitors to be able to control the lights, windows and blinds.

The garden outside was also very accessible. it was level access, the fruit beds were at a great height and the summer house had a ramp for easy access for wheelchair users."
5338,Staff very friendly and helpful- nothing is too much trouble. 
5339,"Although I didn't come across many staff, everyone was very helpful and after speaking to a few who are volunteering as an access buddy, they have a good understanding of what's required."
5340,"Disabled access was excellent. They have wheelchair accessible ramps to the main entrance and the main entrance also has automatic doors. The galleries themselves, the shop and cafe are all on one level. "
5341,Good access for an old building.  Lower ground a bit cramped but still do-able (maybe better on a quieter weekday)
5342,Poolside changing rooms with shower and toilet facilities and large changing table with hoisting for visitors who wear products
5343,The access was generally very good. There was a automatic door to the and then flat floors throughout the venue.
5344,Staff have been excellent on several occasions. Assistance offered without having to ask.  Also suggest best routes.
5345,"There are two accessible parking bays which are the closest spaces to the store. The spaces have hatch markings, making it easy to get in and out of the car. "
5346,"I was hoping to come with my partner and toddler so I could watch them jumping on the trampolines, but this is unfortunatelly impossible with anyone with mobility issues as there is no lift and there’s 2 sets of stairs going to the cafe overlooking the trampoline area..it has ruined my day and made me feel like I’m asking for something ‘extra’ when I just wanted to watch them having fun as I can not join in. "
5347,There was a woman that was amazing
5348,"Villa Timily was the perfect villa for my family of 2 adults and 2 children aged 15 and 12. The area was suitable for my electric scooter, as I am disabled.
Arranged a hire car through Sundance with Cy-Breeze. Nick was waiting for us at the airport and was very helpful, car was only a few months old  
The welcome pack was really nice... picked by someone who had put some thought into it.
The villa was spotless with a good sized open plan kitchen, dining room and living area. The 3 double bedrooms were very spacious. There was a family shower room and a very large en suite wet room. The ramps to the front door and to the pool were great but there was even a ramp over the rail for the patio door making it very easy to get in and out. All doors were wide enough for most wheelchairs or scooters. The wet room was brilliant with lots of space to turn my scooter around. There was a support rail next to the toilet and a fold-up stool on the wall ..."
5349,The location is very accessible as it is situated on a main road and only 5 minutes from the town of Bakewell. The site itself is a renovated train station that is attached to the popular Monsal Trail a re-established set of tunnels  and open viaducts that boast excellent views.
5350,They were very easy to find and clean.
5351,"We stayed in September 2016, popping in literally at the last minute on the off chance. Unfortunately they only had two free nights in the static caravan but we stayed there non the less. What a good job we did though. Everything about that caravan we liked from the quality of the interior and exterior to the wet room.

It has obviously been kitted out with serious consideration for those less able than myself. And I wouldn’t hesitate recommending it to anyone who is either disabled themselves or who has a member in their family who might be disadvantaged in some way. They’ve even installed a fully adjustable electrically operated bed.

 It’s been a long time since I have stayed in a caravan and how everything has changed. It has all the mod cons, even a washing machine and dryer which have been conveniently installed outside of  the caravan itself, but under cover and absolutely no steps whatsoever. 

Beautiful views over open fields, with the Abby and Whitby in the distance and a very peaceful and quite location. 

Certainly when and not if, we return to that wonderful part of the world. It will be at Summerfield Farm where we will be staying. 

Thank you one again for having us! 

David & Trish Carter."
5352,They were all really helpful and checked where we wanted to sit rather than just presuming that we had to sit at the back.
5353,"There is a Taxi Rank at the gates and a Taxi fare from the Albert Docks area to the ground is around £7.00.
There is some parking available in the Streets around the ground on non match days 
However on match days there are restrictions on both the Taxi rank and on street parking so many hours before kick off.
The club website gives details on this and is something that changes due to games being rescheduled for television etc.
There is also a special bus that runs from the city centre Albert Docks area to the ground and again you will find details on this on the club web site.
Did not actually see the bus which is a double decker to know if wheelchairs can access the lower deck."
5354,"there was accessible access to some buildings however not to go upstairs in the buildings and the steps were uneven and slightly slippery. the streets were quite uneven and in areas narrow. it can be quite a long walk to go from area to area. however cafes and shops offered good access,"
5355,Staff were awesome. Very helpful and cheery. Happy to chat to you if you wanted.
5356,"Loved this place. From Napoleon's toothbrush to shrunken heads there is so much to see. And that's just the 'everyday' exhibitions - they have lots of other things going on too. 

Accessibility is great - my pal said that the platform lift was 'the best platform lift he'd ever seen'."
5357,"Information desk staff very helpful, box office staff unhelpful.  Policy regarding no exchange of tickets too rigid."
5358,Not enough - 20+ disabled parking spaces but only 2 accessible loos.
5359,I was taken aback by the number of waiting and welcome staff at Dishoom. Most of them offer a very warm welcome from start to finish. 
5360,"There are two spaces at the front for Disabled but they can be full,plus the other spaces you are limited on hours to park "
5361,There is an accessible loo but it is not signed and is not with the other toilets.  It is small so only really suitable for those who can stand to use the toilet.   Dogs are welcome in the bar but not normally in the restaraunt. I'm sure an assistance dog would be welcome but let them know in advance and I'm sure they would find a suitable table.
5362,Staff helpful and not patronising. As access is good less reason to request assistance.
5363,Staff were very welcoming and were on hand if I needed any further assistance with anything. 
5364,"The Macmillan Cancer Centre is part of University College Hospital. It provides diagnosis and treatment for cancer. There is also the Macmillan Support and Information Service  to provide assistance and advice for patients, family and friends.

This review is written post lockdown and there are a lot of covid-19 measures in place. I have been here for 2 seperate appointments within the last 2 weeks so it is a combined review of both visits."
5365,"Kept pretty clean and the toilet itself is reasonably high.  A wheelchair could just about fit in the space available but it would be tight.  Additionally, the pull-down rail is in front of rather than at the side of the toilet. "
5366,"Although fairly small the toilet was clean and manageable, and I am using an electric wheelchair. Previous comments talked about clutter and Cleanliness but I’m pleased to say they have upped their game.
"
5367,"A very accessible gym that I am a member of. The gym is located at Perth College UHI. Public membership is £25 a month with significant discounts for students. A timetable of various fitness classes run every week and all classes are free to members. 

"
5368,There are customer toilets available these are on the left hand side of the store as you go in. You go through one door from the shop floor area then you will see the accessible toilet in front of you a good basic accessible toilet. There was a red cord available sadly this had been cut and was just short of the floor.
5369,"There is accessible toilet next to the gents on the lower floor, so you will need manual ramp if you are not sitting on the lower area, which is a RADAR key and shared with the baby change. The toilet is quite small, has one drop rail and one wall mounted vertical rail."
5370,"The centre has excellent accessible facilities.  I arrived using their Silk Street entrance, which is at street level, and slopes gently into the centre of the complex. There was step free access throughout my entire visit, with automatic main doors and lifts.
I visited Cinema 1 which is on level -2. When I exited the lift there was a foyer with seating area and ticket desk, at standing height. 
There are 2 step free boxes at the rear of the auditorium and directly accessible from the foyer. I was in box B. It had a private entrance, with 2 manual doors. Inside the box were 2 free standing chairs, it was spacious and would accommodate a wheelchair user. There was an excellent uninterrupted view of the screen. It is secluded and private, so I felt confident storing my crutch and knowing it wouldn't be in anyone's way. I felt like royalty. All the other seating in Cinema 1 involves steps with a single handrail.
There is an induction loop in the auditorium.
Assistance dogs are permitted in the cinema but there is also the option to leave them with a member of staff.
They have access film screenings with both audio description and captioned film in the same screening. Also relaxed screenings."
5371,At first glance parking appears difficult but there are actually some dedicated spaces that can give direct and level access straight into the theatre - simply contact the box office ahead of your visit to discuss what is helpful for you. Buses pass along the busy street outside and there a stops nearby that are served by Lothian Buses - all accessible.
5372,Lift from top floor to bottom floor. Free Wi-Fi! They have hoists to get you in and out of the boats if you are disabled...
5373,Richmond Station is nearby and staff are always on hand to provide ramp and other assistance. Many bus routes serve Richmond.
5374,"The Lobster Shack is a great place to pick up fresh seafood and seriously tasty chips in North Berwick. The lobster is phenomenal and the sea views are the perfect backdrop. While the counter is very high at this seafood shack, there are numerous tables and places to sit all around and the harbour and seafront have good disabled access. The staff were so friendly that I'm sure they'd be happy to assist."
5375,The accessible toilet is fully equipped with rails and handles. The only downside is a sharp corner to enter the toilet (see picture below)
5376,"The lady at the tourist information office, spoke good English, and explained what there was to see and answered my questions about what was accessible."
5377,Excellent
5378,"The waiter service was a little bit slow to take my order, but nothing to spoil the visit in fact it made me feel I could relax and I wouldn't be hurried out, but the arrival of the food (in my case cake) and asking for the bill were fine. Staff speak fluent English."
5379,We drove to the venue.  Unfortunately the Odeon car park becomes an overflow car park when there is a football match on at the John Smiths' stadium ...as there was on the night in question. Parking was not as easy as it usually is & we ended up parking half on half off the pavement!
5380,"The railway station is a major transport hub, as well as trains, there is an accessible tube station serving several lines. There are also several bus routes that serve the station and stop outside the entrance or close by."
5381,No ramps required as all access is on the flat.
5382,Wheelchair accessible restaurant serving delicious Italian food 
5383,"I didn't see any signs for toilets on the pier, but there may have been some in the amusement areas or in the cafes/ pub, which I didn't go into. 

I did find an accessible toilet plus non accessible toilets near the entrance to the pier. This involved turning right on exiting the pier, following the slope until it met the path that goes under the pier. Then going towards this path to  the pier the accessible toilet is on the right hand side before their pier, see photos. The accessible toilet is not easy to find when you are walking towards the pier as the yellow sign, see photo, is on the back of the cubicle. There was also another sign saying radar key could be obtained from the attendant in the ladies. However when I went into the ladies, there were pay gates and I didn't see an attendant and when I called out I got no reply. The toilet was spacious and had grab rails. Sorry I don't seem to have a photo of this toilet and I can't honestly remember if there was a red emergency cord."
5384,Bus stop very close by that a number of buses stop at. I believe there is parking underneath the Omni Centre but we didn't use it on this visit.
5385,Only spoke to one member of staff when necessary however she was very friendly and helpful. When people watching around the restaurant all the staff seemed to be very nice.
5386,"Slight ramp to access, access button in place outside and inside the shop to enable door to open . Everything on the flat. As mentioned a bit tight in places to manoeuvre wheelchair, but owner happy to help.
General layout of shop has improved from my last visit , and  it is  now more accessible to browse goods"
5387,"Honestly the parking was amazing! We parked right on the forecourt with the British Museum building next to us. They opened these gates that I have been through lots of times but have never seen opened before. We parked right outside.

You do need to organise parking in advance but this is easily done on the museum’s website.

NB The museum is having some temporary work (it wasn't when I visited) but I have been assured parking has been thought about and it is only temporary - see their website for further details."
5388,"There was an accessible toilet in the ground floor foyer. It was located in between the regular toilets. The accessible toilet required a radar key. I personally don't like the accessible toilet being kept locked inside a public building, especially as there was plenty of staff in the foyer, checking tickets, at the box office, security staff and people serving at the refreshment counter, there could be regular checks to keep an eye on the toilet. There was also an accessible toilet on the 4th floor near the auditorium, this did not require a radar key and given the isolation of the toilet I would feel this one was more likely to be abused than the one in the foyer. Both toilets were spacious, clean, with grab rails and the emergency cord reached to the floor."
5389,"Very nice. When I initially phoned to check accessibility, the lass seemed clued up and understood my needs and what I might want to know. The serving staff were lovely, unobtrusive and fast to respond when we called - there's a gadget on the table that you press to summon them!"
5390,I’ve been going each year with my family for over 10 years 
5391,Super helpful & very friendly.
5392,Service was excellent and the staff were helpful.
5393,"I would give higher if I could. As soon as I go in, the staff know I'm not always good on my feet. Straight away, they will leave what they're doing and bring me a key for a scooter. When I've finished shopping, I only have to ask and the security guard will get me a trolley to put my shopping in. All through the store, there are plenty of people working on the shop floor to help reach items "
5394,"The Cathedral have made a massive effort with their accessibility including the main section, side chapels and their shop. Great for a spot of quite contemplation."
5395,"When you could get to them they were clean and well maintained. It seemed that there was nowhere enough of them and they seemed to be in sections that when I was trying to get out of the arena at the end of the night I was told I couldn't go to the nearest one as I needed a ""VIP ticket"" to use it even though I had used it on the way in."
5396,"Fully accessible, plenty of room and clean"
5397,Taxi can stop right outside. Parking available right along Market Street (if you can get a space). Close to Waverley Station - not sure where the nearest bus stop would be though.
5398,"Can't comment on the disabled parking. Bus number 24 got us there from the city centre. Buses are wheelchair accessible. You need to buy a chipkaart in advance, and tap it on a machine both after boarding the bus and before leaving.  We were helped on by enthusiastic fellow passengers, and helped off in the same way - so quickly that the Accompanist almost forgot to tap the chipkaarts out. You enter the bus by the middle doors. There appeared to be a ramp, but the driver evidently saw that we were being helped and decided not to deploy. 
Tram number 16 also runs from the city centre to the museum, but don't be fooled by the caption on Google Maps which says that the tram stop at the museum is wheelchair accessible. The tram stop may be, but the trams using this route are not!
For the record, trams numbered 1, 6, 12 and 16 are NOT wheelchair accessible, though the good news is that the route taken by tram number 1 is being modernised so that, at some point in the future, wheelchair accessible trams will run on it. This route can take you from the city centre to the seaside resort of Scheveningen (Holland's answer to Blackpool) or, in the opposite direction to the neighbouring city of Delft."
5399,"Not as advertised, repairs and maintenance was ongoing."
5400,"Level entry to reception. Automatic entry on approaching door, push pad to exit. Wide corridors and doorways to all rooms. Lifts to upstairs and basement level rooms. "
5401,"The toilets are upstairs which I didn't know before booking. There are fairly steep stairs, about one flight, but there are chairs near the top by the toilets if you can manage with difficulty but need a rest. I managed with help. The toilet I used was very small and didn't have rails but did have furniture to lean on. You wold struggle to get a carer in this one with you, but the second one was bigger. 

The waiter did give me the option of using their sister restaurant Robatary's disabled toilet, which is about 5 doors down. Not ideal but an option if you wish to eat here."
5402,Come by car. That way  you will find a disabled spot much easier to park in. 
5403,Staff are as helpful as they can be and always willing to give directions etc.
5404,Disabled bays on the road outside and on St Giles. You can use residents only bays if you have a blue badge.
5405,"A staff member looks after this seating area and will show you to your space or seat. We did not need her assistance, but she seemed friendly & helpful. She gets 5 stars, as do conductor Sir Simon Rattle, soloist Krystian Zimerman and the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. I wasn't quite as impressed by the box office staff, for reasons explained above."
5406,Very friendly and caring staff who care deeply about accessibility. 
5407,Buitifully restored former school. Very friendy owners. Superb breakfast. Buitifully appointed room with accessable shower. Shallow ramp to main door from car park. Good parking. This accomodation was the highlight of our stay.
5408,A car park with two disabled places. 
5409,I got a bus (has accessible space for 1 scooter) from the airport. This stops nearby. 
5410,It’s an old building so some issues but generally really good. Toilet on ground floor. Seating on a different floor. There is a lift that is operated by staff. They have a viewing area with bar stools. I could see over the bar at the edge of the platform but a much shorter person might struggle. 
5411,"Really stylish modern racecourse, easy to find, being located on a main road near to Edinburgh with many transport links. Good signage on to the racecourse and throughout the venue.  Disabled parking on to grass, thereafter solid smooth track quite a distance to walk/push a wheelchair to the main buildings. They are looking to provide a shuttle service for the less mobile in the near future, all disabled friendly.  This an excellent venue for a really all round good family day out, providing accessible amenities for every age and ability.  Good quality priced food from burger van to well apointed restaurant, or you could take your own picnic as there is a large raised picnic area (ramped at both ends) in front the the stands, next to the race track to be feel part of the action  Large viewing screen sited for all to see easily, with panoramic views undercover looking out over the racecourse with lifts to all levels.  The racecourse often provides specialty days with music and other entertainment on offer, look on their website for information.
"
5412,We visited universal studios and island of adventures for the rest of the family and their love of the big rides. I only wanted to see Harry Potter and I wasn't disappointed by it. But it was mighty hard to get through the rest of the parks.
5413,"There is a good sized accessible toilet - however, it is currently also used as a storage area. Again staff are quick to clear things out but this is not good enough as it requires the customer to signal they need the loo!"
5414,Whole of the park was accessible other than some of the children’s play area due to lipped surfaces which weren’t so easy to navigate. 
5415,"Within Mar y Sol hotel all facilities are completely accessible by wheelchair. There are a range of 1 bed apartments, rooms and studios with a  complementary choice of toilet/shower chair pre delivered to the location. Lifts are huge and have voice announcements at each floor. There are three swimming pools one heated to 90 degrees with a choice of two different hoists for access and a dedicated lifeguard who will help lift clients from pool to chair via the hoists. One pool is for therapies in particular with physios etc. In the restaurant there is a huge range of dishes many with health in mind (and champagne!) all accessible by wheelchair and waiters will accompany guests to load plates or bring food/drink on request. Further staff are available to hire on site should guests need help with eating or personal care. The LERO shop on site allows for hire of a vast range of equipment from power wheelchairs to hoists and pool floats, incontinence garments etc."
5416,Easy to find . Clean
5417,"It's on a fairly busy road, however there are other residential side streets that you might be able to find a spot."
5418,"Not being particularly Arty, when losing ones sight, it has been one of those if only moments. We are interested in all things Jacobean, Tudor and Stuart.
So enveloped in a visit to Hampton Court Palce was a visit to see and experience a wonderfully conceived presentation of portraits through this period, of Queens, Kings, notable figures famous and infamous. The audio description was superb to compliment the portaits I have seen on countless tv documentaries and later at Hampton Court.

The Gallery being mid Victorian has been  modified where possible to accommodate better access, with its own entrance and exit, ramps and lifts."
5419,"The staff (and the food) really make this place. Taking my son out for meals is an important part of our life as a family. He enjoys the social opportunities it provides. At Mia's all the staff - owner, waiters and kitchen staff make him feel welcome."
5420,I loved how open and spacious this venue was. All the floors were super smooth and the rooms brightly lit. Nice big cafe and interesting shop. Star lost because not all of the shop was completely accessible.
5421,"All too eager to help and really friendly and kind. Extremely knowledgeable too, which is always an added bonus! "
5422,"The museum focuses on Crete’s ancient history with Minoan, Greek and Roman artefacts. There is also a garden area. The entire museum is step free."
5423,"Brilliant, parking close to the entrance and bus transits all fully accessible."
5424,Staff were very welcoming and  helpful on arrival.
5425,"The parking bays are very small and poorly marked, no extra space for wheelchair access, some of the larger cars were well over their allotted spaces."
5426,"Staff were exceptional, came out in the pouring rain to advise about the paving and wheelchair access at the lower level, could not have done more"
5427,"Signage is good, and there is a ramp."
5428,Access limited by wooden baby changing unit and shortened red cord. No space to side transfer due to position of baby changing unit b
5429,"Great, most of the gardens were accessible"
5430,"The car park is super flat, and there's a road sized space between stalls (they have to fit cars after all!). Stalls vary depending on what people bring to display their items, but most tables are at a nice low height. You may need to bend down to the ground to rummage for some things, however sellers are usually more than happy to show you what they've got to offer - then get ready to bargain for a good deal! 

There aren't many places to take shelter if the weather turns bad, so be prepared for this. There are refreshments available - burgers, coffees etc."
5431,"4 disabled parking spots right near pub that also serve the train station.

Not sure about bus access but it is right by Windsor Riverside train station. We drove, but got the following access info for the station off of trainline: “ There is level access to all platforms until around 20:00. After 20:00 access to the station is via three steps and wheelchair users may require assistance.”"
5432,"An eye opening and exhilarating sailing experience. On arrival at Carrickfergus sailing club Everyone was kitted out with flotation devices and water proofs were avaliable for anyone who needed them. The only equipment you need to take part are an old pair of trainers or wellies. I joined a group of sea scouts and adults of various ages with and without disabilities. In the plush surroundings of  carrickfergus marina Ann  and Bill made disability awareness training fun. It's amazing what you learn with a blindfold on. As Ann pointed out even if you have a disability you receive the training to make you aware of other disabilities including the many hidden. 
Excitement grew on the pontoon where we split up into different boats. Anyone who wanted to stay with their wheelchair easily boarded a sea- rover at the stern by a mechanical ramp. A hoist is also available and supportive cushions can be used to 
assist balance and keep you upright.
I boarded the 'hawk' - reassuranily an unsinkable sailing boat , it self rights itself even with the sail up.  I felt very safe and for an hour enjoyed the fabulous view of Carricfergus castle and Shoreline of Belfast Lough in the company of our learned crew Owen and Stephen on the tiller ( together with some perching birds).  
Sailing gives you an appetite and a well timed barbacue rounded of a FABULOUS experience.
If your looking for an exhilarating challenge why not join sailabilty at carrickfergus Wednesday and Saturday mornings?  As sailor or volunteer. 
Thanks to all the volunteers who make it 
possible. I can't wait to get out again.
"
5433,"You visit Malin Head because it's the most northerly point in Ireland, and it was definitely good from an access perspective that you can get all the way there by car. There's a car park with a low-key modern toilet block, and when we were there, a couple of trailers selling drinks, home-made cakes and souvenirs. As a scooter-using visitor, I enjoyed the views from the clifftops, the fresh air and being in what still feels like quite a remote, wild place. I really wished I could have gone on some of the gravel paths around the cliffs, though, and there was one in particular where it wouldn't have taken too much more to have made it accessible (level it off a bit and remove the odd small ledge or step. Anyway, it was still a beautiful place and I'm glad I went."
5434,a few changing rooms and an accessable loo as well
5435,An awesome organic and vegetarian cafe and shop just outside of Falkland in fife. If you're in the area this is a must visit! 
5436,"Getting to the cathedral for a wheelchair user could be tricky, there are narrow paths and a cobbled street. There is a longer route to the cathedral which is slightly easier and is via the cloisters. There is disabled parking available on Palace Green and there is also a shuttle bus that has wheelchair access (although this was tested on the day)."
5437,"The pathways surrounding enclosures are slightly uneven but are still accessible to wheelchair users. The pathways are large, and at busy periods are still spacious and enclosures are viewable. 
The Park has a café at the main entrance which is fully accessible for wheelchair users as there is a ramp and large double doors with an access button. The gift shop is accessible through a disability lift in the café.  A member of staff has to be present to use the lift. Which at busy times can be difficult and sometimes a long wait."
5438,Staff were nice. Currently it is all table service. They did let me know when I booked that we only had the table for a limited amount of time and it did feel a bit like they were in a rush to get the table back towards the end of the meal. 
5439,Wide doorways and corridors throughout; plenty of room for a wheelchair.
5440,"Spacious, equipped with a wheelchair-accessible washbasin, wheelchair-accessible loo (side transfer from one side possible), both with good grab rails. The wet room shower is easy to operate, but has no grab rails near it. A movable stool is provided, but this was too low to be safely used in the absence of grab rails. A good bathroom and could be outstanding given a fixed fold-down seat by the shower and sensibly positioned grab rails so that a user who can get out of the wheelchair can move safely into the shower. This wheelchair user needed the accompanist's help. Also, see  below."
5441,"Staff are kind of pot luck..some nice, some a bit indifferent but no bad experiences.
Butcher at counter very helpful and brought the goods id bought around to the front of counter without me asking(i could not reach as I'm very short..lol)."
5442,"The Rio is an independent, 2 screen cinema in Dalston, East London. It screens mainstream and art house films.  "
5443,"Ample parking, mixture of pay bays, disabled access bays, Bus Services, 11, 15, 16, 23, 36 and 45 stop with 15m northbound and 30m southbound."
5444,A wide level promenade which provides extended views of the seashore on one side and land under the cliffs which is a small nature reserve.
5445,Access is ok and could be a lot better if there wasn't high chairs and signs in the corridor to the accessible loo. The lock on the accessible loo is pretty hard to deal with too. Staff were very nice though and try to keep a space at the front for wheelchair users.
5446,No red cord but ok.
5447,There is a big car park. 
5448,"Staff, if a bit slow, were extremely friendly and helpful during our visit."
5449,The disabled toilet was spacious and had enough room for the carer. The toilet we used had just been cleaned and it was regularly cleaned throughout the day.
5450,"Staff vary, mostly fine but there is no low serving space on the bar which is staffed by a mixture of part time staff, probably students, some are not aware of the needs of disabled."
5451,"Staff were very friendly, finding us a table that suited our needs and providing vegetarian options for my wife."
5452,"Reasonable drive to get to hotel, then 3 disabled bays available quite close to entrance, and then all areas on the level."
5453,The door is wide enough for good wheelchair access and there's no raised threshold to do battle with. Once inside there's a decent amount of space to get to the bar or choose a table. Might be a bit tight when it's busier such as a Friday night.
5454,Staff very helpful and polite
5455,"Really nice & helpful staff! Great toilets, terrible food!"
5456,"Staff in the café were friendly and helpful.
They was knowledgable and happy for me to ask about allergies when I asked about the ingredients in the soup.
When I spoke with the staff at customer services about the lack of accessible parking spaces I felt listened to."
5457,Are a good size in the museum. There  is also an accessible toilet at the cottage area.
5458,Spent a great couple of hours around the Loch. Didnt get to see any beavers as it was mid afternoon as apparantly they usually come out early morning and evening.
5459,"Sidmouth doesn't have a railway station. The 9 or 9A bus from Exeter takes about 35 - 45 minutes and stops at the Sidmouth Triangle, round the corner from the museum."
5460,A modern outlet village with full access. A great venue for a day out. 
5461,"There is a disabled toilet in The Fort and is spacious for a wheelchair and if they need assistance also but, there is no changing place toilet though. Down at the beach in Broughty Ferry there is a changing place although, it is only open till 5pm in the Summer and 3:30pm in the Winter."
5462,On site car park. Bus stop outside.
5463,"Staff are very friendly and helpful, if you need help to reach higher items in the store, assistance can be arranged.  If you speak to customer service on arrival, a member of staff can be arranged to accompany you around the store.  Staff are really accommodating and happy to help, volunteering other information of services available."
5464,"The staff were very friendly and helpful. At the viewing point staff from the refreshments bar came and took orders and promptly returned with hot chips and beverages.
We even had a visit from Flinty the mascot!"
5465,"Mariatorget Metro Station

Mariatorget Metro Station is located on the corner of Swedenborgsgatan, a pedestrianised street with lots of cafes and restaurants and a 2 minute walk to Mariatorget square. The metro station is on the red lines 13 and 14. It is 2 stops from Gamla Stan (Old Town) and 3 stops from T Centralen (main railway terminal) which has a number of line interchanges. With frequent trains this means it is very quick to access other parts of the city. 

Mariatorget Metro Station is step free. It has a lift on the pavement outside of the station which goes to the ticket hall. Alternatively there are steps, including some steps with rails (see photo) which I saw a person using with a shopping trolley, but I have no idea if the gradient would make it suitable for wheelchair users. At the ticket hall level are ticket barriers. In front of the barriers there are brass rods on the floor. Where there are 3 rows of parallel rods this is where the entrance is to the ticket barrier. Where there is a single row of rods this is a no entry ticket barrier, as people are entering it from the opposite side. On the ticket barrier level there is also a small convenience store selling snacks, drinks, magazines, etc. There is then escalators or a lift, which is quite slow to travel and looks like it has been placed in the space where an escalator previously was as it is on a slope descending (see photo), which goes from the ticket hall to platform level. From here it is a level walk to the platform.

Sodra Railway Station

Sodra railway station is on the same street as  Mariatorget Metro Station and a few minutes walks away. This railway station is a commuter railway line. However trains from here go direct to Arlanda Airport. There are 2 trains per hour from Arlanda Airport to Sodra and the train journey takes about 40 minutes.  Please note that the trains to Sodra depart from Arlanda Central Station in Sky City, although you remain indoors, this is a quite a walk from the airport terminus.  The final thing to note about this route is that even if you have a pre-paid travel card you have to pay a supplement of 120 SEK (2019) to travel on this route. It was explained to me that this is because it is a train line owned by a different company and you pay an additional charge at the start or end of your journey to cover these charges. 

Sodra railway station has a lift from street level, where the ticket office is, to the platform. Outside the station I noticed a sign for special assistance (2019). It said in Swedish and English Meeting Point Pre-Booked Assistance for help and further advice call +46 774 55 55. There was also some writing in braille. There was also a logo of 2 people walking holding hands. 

For both the commuter trains and Metro there were lifts (Hiss in Swedish) and in the carriages there were priority seats. I didn't notice any designated wheelchair spaces but I was always making for the nearest carriage, so I feel unable to comment on that. On board there are announcements in Swedish, and occasionally in English, there is also a board in each carriage and an announcement for the next stop. The board shows or announces nasta (which is Swedish for next) and then it says the stop. Public transport is excellent and frequent."
5466,There are about 5 disabled spaces although  it is a common place for the elderly to go for lunch so the disabled spaces do seem to fill up quickly. The only way to get to the garden centre is by car or taxi. There is no bus stop near by and no footpath on the road outside the garden centre.
5467,"We were made extremely welcome by everyone from the table staff to the owner. We kept commenting on how the level of service made us feel like we were abroad. The owner came over to speak to us for a while too, which was very much appreciated."
5468,Huge carpark with many disabled parking spaces close to the shops. Bus stops close by to connect to Stirling and Alloa. 
5469,"Very easy to find the hotel if driving.  Perfect if going to or coming from the Tunnel.
Plenty of parking, including dedicated disabled parks, all in open air, so no height restrictions.  Step-free from car park to reception."
5470,Generally speaking all types of transport are available gates located all round the stadium so very easy to access!
5471,"Earlier reviews say it all. Very well equipped, clean and spacious cottage that worked well for our non-ambulent daughter and her assistant. "
5472,Not needed.
5473,"The staff I encountered were alert, friendly and keen to help. For this: five stars. But they have forfeited half of those stars by their really very inconsiderate and thoughtless habit of cluttering up the aisles and making the shop so wheelchair-unfriendly."
5474,Staff cheery and helpful. 
5475,"clean, roomy and accessible"
5476,"Bays both undercover and in the open , next to the door. Lift and automatic doors nearby."
5477,"The exhibition has two entrances with the side entrance being the nearest to the accessible parking area. Both entrances have ramps and wide doors.

The Centre is tucked away on the edge of the village and is best visited with a car or your own vehicle. There are public bus services that run along the main road from Inverness and a bus stop is nearby.

The Centre is based around several buildings that are all next door to each other so you don’t have too far to walk. There are plenty of opportunities to pause and take a rest.

The main exhibition is located in the main ‘house’ - a large and imposing building that nestles in the hillside and looks out toward the Loch. There are two doors to get in and once inside the seven gallery areas are level access and easy to move around.

You start your journey with a trip back in time looking at the formation of the Loch. As you can imagine legends and myths run strong in the Loch Ness story and you can find out about the “Water Horse” and what local folk say. 

Over time there has been many projects researching the secrets beneath the water and the exhibition tells the stories from these and the discoveries made. You end with modern day stories and events as the Loch played host to history.

Leaving the exhibition you can explore the shops, dip into the whisky shop, grab a coffee in the cafe or explore the garden areas. Don’t forget to visit the Nessie Shop where you can get all the monster souvenirs you can imagine!
"
5478,"There are plenty of disabled loos, though the one close to the cafe down a tight corridor is worth avoiding when open (tight corridor, parents using it as a baby change). The rest are spacious and clean. I don’t think any are Changing Places, however. Please check online."
5479,The staff were very helpful and friendly.
5480,The toilet was easy to find and did have grab rails. As I'm not a wheelchair user I don't know how much space there is but from what I can see there looks to be enough room to manoeuvre.
5481,Staff are reasonably okay but don't really have much dealings with them.
5482,Great staff been going for years. Will always be wiling to assist.
5483,"Parked in the large car park, we were parked facing primark (again level) and could walk straight through, no problem"
5484,Really impressed with the accessibility at the City Halls. From the entrance to the staff to the different lifts for different sections of the auditorium. Good signage too.
5485,"Edward and Marian are ably supported by Pam and Nicki, all of whom couldn't do enough for me. They were always on hand to help or have an interesting chat, were very attentive and understanding, and always ensured I had everything I needed."
5486,"A delightful day awaits all that travels on ‘The Watercress Line’ we visited when Thomas the Tank Engine was visiting as well. Nothing was too much for the helpers at the railway stations we visited they put me and my family in a guards van while we traveled on the railway if I were able to walk from the guards van I could of left my mobility scooter there and had a table seat in the main carriages but I cannot do so,So we waited in the guards van which had plenty of seats for my family. "
5487,"Helpful staff, quick to assist."
5488,Five star. See above
5489,The staff were lovely and so helpful.
5490,"There were ramps for any wheelchairs and steps, and many benches around the park to sit and rest."
5491,Large accessible toilet in the reception. Plenty space to move around.
5492,Level access. Tables moved accordingly 
5493,"Friendly, helpful and English-speaking."
5494,"The Pleasance Courtyard simply doesn't work for many wheelchair users. With uneven surfaces, a tricky 'accessible' loo and difficult to manage nooks and crannies it isn't great."
5495,"All staff helpful and friendly. They showed us different types of accessible rooms for future visits. They made a fuss of older lady in party who was celebrating her birthday, which was much appreciated."
5496,There is a couple of disabled car parks but these were full (and not all cars had displayed blue badges) so we had to park on the road.
5497,Plenty of room to turn chair to transfer to toilet or to roll commode chair over toilets
5498,"The restaurant/bar at street level has a doorman to let you through the 2 doors and there are 2 lifts down to the basement restaurant. When you arrive in the basement there is plenty of space and an area to leave coats and bags. The restaurant is large but the tables are quite close together. The tables are not great for a wheelchair user although the staff moved me to the best available table although this meant I was still some distance from the table due to the position of the table legs.
See photo of lift."
5499,Absolutely fantastic. A good welcome and help onto the platform. 
5500,"Paignton is a traditional sea side resort. There is a beach, pier (see separate review), harbour, town centre with amusement arcades, gift shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants. "
5501,"Great food, drinks and venue. Has wheelchair lift to each floor but it hard to use by yourself because it is blocked with chairs."
5502,"Access by road essential, as fairly remote location. Paved parking area for 3/4 cars"
5503,"All staff were very friendly and gave fun, informative talks about the animals. "
5504,Canal museum is located a short distance from Kings Cross station.
5505,"The access was remarkable, it had step free access into the coffee shop and smooth floors inside the shop.   "
5506,"I really think that considering the NTW part of the reserve is labelled as having disabled access - then they should ensure that the areas leading to the disabled access area is also accessible. Attempting to get down the side of two fields to a purpose built board walk and hide specifically supplied with ramps for wheelchair access makes little sense. I would not attempt this alone on my mobility scooter. There was also a slight step up to the boardwalk, which my scooter did manage but some might not."
5507,"I am writing with deep regret to complain about the very poor treatment we experienced on the 8th Feb at Prezzo Aberdeen, Union Square.

We have visited this establishment many times before and have always been greeted with smiles, accommodated, and been served some really good food.

Last night, this was not the case.

I’m paralysed from the neck down and confined to an electric wheelchair. On arrival, we were greeted immediately and taken to a table of four in the middle of the restaurant near the kitchen. As I cannot control my temperature due to my disability we always ask to be seated to the right hand side wall as it is more comfortable for us as the air conditioning in the middle area can make it quite cold.

The restaurant was not busy and there were tables in that area. The waiter then informed us that we were not permitted to sit in that area as I was a fire hazard. To our amazement we told the waiter that every time we have visited the restaurant before we have been seated in that area to which he repeated again we could not sit there as it would be a fire hazard (I can only presume he had decided we were a fire risk). We then reinforced our knowledge saying that we had been seated there before and the waiter then told us that that area was a “premium seating area which was popular and it was for tables of four only”………………..I was actually insulted at that point as I thought he was joking. I said you have just taken us to a table which seats four outwith the “premium seating area”. As we had highlighted this to him he then said you cannot sit there as the tables are booked. Three reasons within a space of about 5 minutes.

At that point I said that I was upset and we were leaving and the waiter said “ok then, goodbye”.

I am sorry but is this really is no way to treat a disabled customer (a regular) which I believe is down to very poor training and lack of knowledge on behalf of the waiter who has obviously never undertaken equality training or has any concept on appropriate language when dealing with people. To tell someone in a wheelchair that they are a fire hazard is not acceptable.

Life for anyone with a disability is extremely challenging, for many reasons, and this once again adds to the frustrations we face on a daily basis. All we wanted was a nice meal, a glass of wine and to be able to sit at a table, like everyone else “the priority people” and not feel out of place.

The waiter went immediately up to the supervisor to explain his position but I am sorry, his actions and his treatment cannot be excused on any level. We are equal to any visitor going to this restaurant, we work hard, we pay our taxes and the only thing that is different about us is the attitudes of others to what they believe makes us different.

If you do indeed have “premium seats” in your establishment and a policy criteria which identifies a wheelchair user as a fire hazard I would like sight of those documents.

I do not believe this to be the case and I am seeking feedback from the disability equalities forum and have taken to social media to find out if anyone else has experienced this treatment.

No one so far can believe that his has happened which is a testament to support my view that this should never have happened.
"
5508,"Access was good; you enter from the car park through double doors with plenty of room, no steps and the staff are very helpful.  It was quiet when I visited so it was easy to negotiate the tables but I would imagine it would be more difficult when they are busier."
5509,i drove in car. as mentioned in other posts parking is plentiful and adjacent to the accommodation. was glad of my sat nav to find the cottages in the dark. a real joy driving along the country lanes.
5510,"A great day out. The venue is very hilly and maybe you should consider the free hire of a robust mobility scooter (booking essential) and it is just £10 deposit (bring ID).  The venue is accessible and they are making considerable efforts to accommodate less able of all types.  You can watch my Youtube based vlog (public: 5th May 2017) where I go around and show you the park from my perspective of a mobility scooter.

Disabled parking and toilets available. Some uneven surfaces but mostly tarmac.  Display cages are a little way from where you stand, but display areas with plain glass are provided.

It's 65 Acres so quite spread out and a lot of walking involved.

Downside is Carers pay too:  £9 for disabled people and £9 for carers.  Adult price is £12."
5511,The staff were very helpful and friendly. They took our order for ice creams and delivered them to our seats during the interval.
5512,Disabled access is no problem as it is all on the level.
5513,Plenty of Blue Badge parking by the main entrance. The main car park is also within easy distance of the entrance.
5514,Exceptional
5515,There was no accessible loo but the men's loo was fine for me as I was using a walking stick.
5516,I got the bus here and a taxi home because I finished at rush hour and don’t like busy busses. The bus stop was close by
5517,"When we arrived the staff were very helpful with our group visit, we were each given leaflets to take home and a brief description of were each train shed was located. The staff were very helpful when we asked them to point us in the direction of a certain train a member of our group wanted to see. Staff were easily recognisable in there uniforms and were around to ask questions if we needed."
5518,There is a large car park with multiple disabled access bays close to the main hangars. A bus service (121) runs between Haddington and North Berwick Mon-Sat which takes you right into the museum.
5519,"Radar key operated accessible loo, though it wasn't locked when I visited. Very well equipped and clean. Well done, Yorkshire Water."
5520,"Holyrood Distillery is situated toward the end of St Leonard's Lane which is just off St Leonard's Streets along the side of the Police Sation. A traditional cobbled street there are good pavements on either side with dropped kerbs. When you arrive at the distillery gates you have to cross a bank of cobbles before reaching the tarmac area or the access path. Not the greatest experience but worth the effort as from the path onward the access to get in is good. 

If you are arriving by car you can be dropped off by the door and then you driver can pop to the nearby street where there is on street parking. Several sections have yellow lines and so are handy for folk with Blue Badges.Taxis can drop you off at the door too. If you are coming by bus you can get a Lothian Buses number 14 which will drop you off at the Police Station some 100 metres along the lane. "
5521,"Mostly flat tarmac surface, but under some of the bridges (especially Harrison Road & Gray's Loan) the towpath is briefly cobbled, narrow & very bumpy. The Slateford Aqueduct towpath is very narrow, cobbled & bumpy and IMO not suitable for wheelchair use.  The towpath can be accessed easily at the Canal Basin, at the Leamington Lift Bridge, at Harrison Park (East & West), at Ashley Terrace and at Meggetland. Beyond Meggetland there is no step free access before the Slateford Aqueduct."
5522,"Was very impressed with this pub and restaurant. The staff are friendly, the atmosphere is welcoming and the accessible beer garden is a nice place to catch up with friends!"
5523,"There are plenty of bus routes in the vicinity, but no step-free trains stations.
"
5524,Disabled parking is available by the West Gate and the John Hope Gateway. Accessible buses pass by the East Gate.
5525,Tesco’s supermarket Claremorris is very accessible and wheelchair friendly.  The is no steps near the entrance and there is a slope onto the pavement.  The supermarket has wide doors necessary for wheelchair users to pass through comfortably.  Nonetheless assistance is required to reach some desired products on the higher shelves.
5526,"The entrance has level access and once inside the zoo it is mainly on the flat. There are some slopes and ramps especially down to the reptile house and there are slopes down to the bear den, which is quite steep. It was manageable in my powerchair, but some people may struggle a little with this.

There is a small cafe located next to the car park, which is a little tight inside but doable. The staff were lovely and very accommodating. The zoo is currently building a larger restaurant/cafe/play area which I think will be much more accessible. It is due to open in Winter 2017 so I'm looking forward to going there the next time I visit."
5527,Staff pleasant and opened wide gate at entrance to let me through.
5528,"Parking isn’t great as it is on the approach to the Castle. That said, there are a couple of accessible parking bays at the top of Johnston Terrace - that around 150metres. There are tour buses of many colours that pass through the nearby Lawn Market and these have great wheelchair access - even space for two chairs which was impressive."
5529,"Staff here are very lovely and always ask me if I need help. They're very patient at the tills with me packing my bag, taking payments and so on."
5530,The toilets in your room is large and spacious with plenty of room to leave a wheelchair.
5531,Staff were fine and I was served quickly but there was little interaction with them.
5532,"There were slopes on the walkway to the Hotel but signage was good - and once in the Hotel, the main obstacle were the thick carpets.  The lifts were a good size too and the interior well signposted."
5533,Excellent off the street level 
5534,Must have car/van to reach. Lanes are narrow if not used to driving in countryside
5535,Without doubt what made the visit was the enthusiastic and friendly people we met. Top marks!
5536, The staff were very helpful and friendly.
5537,The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. A special mention should go to the staff in the Magnus lounge
5538,"Really great. Lots of wide smooth paths, no obstructions to viewing the duck pond which has lots of moorhens, mallard ducks and even the odd cormorant. There isn't a barrier between the bath and the pond though, so take care! Saw lots of seating around the park too if you need to stop and take a rest."
5539,No real access problems.
5540,"A walk, car spaces, route for wheelchairs to get to the view."
5541,"The cinema is on the first floor of the St Enoch Centre, so you first of all have to reach the first floor - there is a lift and escalators. 

From the first floor, there is then an escalator leading to the entrance of the cinema, there is also a lift to the entrance. 
It seems a pity this lift couldn't have gone all the way from the ground floor, as while there is a lift in St Enochs, it isn't at this end of the Centre, so people using wheelchairs do have to take quite a long route.

Once at the entrance, it is smooth flat floors throughout. 
Tickets are bought from machines at the entrance, or online in advance. There are staff around if you need assistance. The cinema screens are numbered and there is a map of the layout of seats outside each screen. There are clear signs to toilets etc.

There is a door into each screen, which some people might find difficult to open (would be good if also had push-button to open automatically), and it is fairly dark as you go through this door and into the cinema, which again could be difficult for some people. 

The screen I was in had spaces for people using wheelchairs at the front nearest the screen. The seating is tiered, with stairs at side with handrail.
All seats are reclining, controlled by the individual. There is a good amount of space when walking along each row of seats. The seats all have there own little moveable table. 

The cinema has some subtitled and audio described films. It has a monthly autism screening."
5542,"Access to the library is fairly good with disabled parking outside, ramped access, automatic doors, and an accessible toilet."
5543,Some parking inside the Sailing club and just outside the gates.
5544,A bit tight to get into.
5545,"I purchased a disabled parking bay in advance which was posted out to me prior to my visit,the cost was £12.50 including postage which i thought was a bit on the expensive side but it was well worth i thought when i got there as the parking was only a 30 second walk to the entrance.I cannot really comment on public transport as i didn't use it but the venue is well served by public transport,but is quite along way from the train station."
5546,"The loo was smart and well equipped. It was easily visible from the main bar area, with a clear sign on the door. The alarm cord was sadly part-tied up otherwise it would have been five stars. Plenty of room to turn a chair inside. Radar key operated but pub had their own key."
5547,"As mentioned above I really appriciate the steward who let me in via the exit.  I know it's busy and crowded but it would be helpful if stewards were more proactive when they see a disabled person queuing up, as given it was so busy I felt awkward to ask if there was arrangements for disabled people knowing that others would be queuing up for a while. "
5548,The access to the Visitors centre is down a short hill - other than that the park is fairly flat. I would highly recommend using their tramper to get about around the park as it covers miles
5549,Very friendly. Just a bit of a shame the ticketing process was a bit of a pain.
5550,"Great if you're arriving by car as you can pull up outside to drop off. Plenty of nearby streets to park with a Blue Badge. If you're walking, or wheeling, the Ox184 nestles below the High Street in the Cowgate area. You need to negotiate the sloped streets and pathways. A bus service does service the Grassmarket which is a level walk some ten minutes away. Optionally, you could grab a taxi (all the Black cabs are wheelchair accessible) and drive to the door."
5551,"This is a branch of Cotswold Outdoor, the suppliers of clothing and paraphernalia for outdoor activities. The entrance is step-free, it's hard to get around some areas of the ground floor, and the lift was out of order so I wasn't able to visit the basement, which contains half of the shop."
5552,"There is a great deal of parking space, although none of the spaces are specifically Blue Badge ones. When you enter there is some parking in front of you, but much more over to the right beyond the kiosk which is not immediately visible. Almost all of the parking is tarmac.

Parking for Blue Badge holders is free but there is a small charge for others."
5553,The stewards were very helpful but not all of them were knowledgeable about the stadium. A young man took us to the away stand and let us in through a gate but informed the man scanning the tickets that we were in the side stand. A few stewards then came and found us to tell us we were in the stand behind the goal. Another young steward led us to the stand behind the goal but we had to push through the fans waiting outside to get to our seats.
5554,"The waiting staff were extremely helpful, checking the suggested able was appropriate, moving chairs, offering physical help if I wanted it.  Couldn't fault them.  It would have been good to have help at the front door, which was awkward for my wheelchair pusher."
5555,They have really thought about trail access here and you can hire bikes here to suit everyone from wheelchair users to those with visual impairment.
5556,"First off, the pints are reasonably priced so there's an incentive to visit. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is hospitable. Not too COVID secure because people are going up to the bar and it can get quite crowded - no booking at table."
5557,"Plenty of car parking, but make sure you park towards the right hand side of the building to access through the disability Scotland Ski centre entrance to avoid the steep incline to the main entrance."
5558,"Good parking but if you visit when it's busy it's hard to find disabled parking bays.
All shops easily accessed and good toilet facilities."
5559,"The access is pretty good, visitor centre and cafe all on one level and step free.

The paths around the sculptures are wide and you can get to most places via a ramp (though you do have to come back on yourselves a few times if your dependant on the ramps). 

Paths and surfaces were easy to walk on. Just watch out for the kids going racket."
5560,A bath instead of a wet room seems like a strange choice for a disabled room.
5561,"Step free, double width doors if you need them"
5562,Much of the site is quite steep but what we did was enjoyable - good visitor centre and tea room too. Didn't go in the house so can't comment on its accessibility.
5563,"Top marks.  Extremely impressed.  Signage was clear and stood out.  Toilets were many including wide cubicles, disabled toilets and changing places toilet and seperate rooms for baby changing and breast feeding so no need to share disabled toilets with stinky nappies! There was plenty of seating around the park and designated seating for those with disabled access passes to wait on their turn on rides.  This was a godsend for me personally.  I cannot comment on hearing or communications access, however it appeared they had put a lot of work into this area of accessibility too."
5564,"Access is good, when shows have floor seating wheelchairs are allowed on front row. There also lots of wheelchair seating om level with great view of stage. Companion can sit beside you. Lifts are large and roomy and manned by staff."
5565,"The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is in the former Middlesex Guildhall, a building constructed over one hundred years ago. It has been superbly adapted to its modern function, and has full step-free access to all areas, accessible toilets, and hearing loops."
5566,"Staff were very apologetic at Spa about loo not being available, but as we had doubled checked twice if facilities would be suitable this was obviously not high on the agenda, as why would somebody in a wheelchair need the loo.  Main spa has no disabled changing facilities which meant I could not have used pool or have a shower after.  "
5567,The staff were nice and helpful
5568,"Wheelchair-accessible pub with an accessible but unsatisfactory toilet, good food, and friendly staff."
5569,"Car park was very busy. 
Can get buses to and from the City Centre."
5570,Staff helpful and friendly
5571,The accessible loo was fine and it was well signposted - but why aren't there more?! We were there for the MS Life show and every time we went past the accessible loo there was always a substantial queue.
5572,"A very flat campsite. Many of the pitches are hard standing covered with gravel. But would be fine with a wheelchair 

There are two toilet and shower blocks both with disabled access / family bathrooms."
5573,Vast new store in Barnstaple. Disabled parking just outside of main entrance. Level access to shop and throughout the store. Most aisles are wide and they even have a wide checkout for wheelchair users. 
5574,there's a ramp to get to the entrance and level access inside
5575,"Great, clean and large toilets."
5576,A number (?) of disabled parking bays and a ramp to the reception automatic door.
5577,The toilets are very roomy so easily usable for both wheelchair and motorised scooter users. Plenty room also if you require a carer to assist you whilst in the toilet.  They are clean and handwashing and drying is easy to do.
5578,"Enthusiastic staff! They seemed to be enjoying being there, and the ones taking the photos were interacting with the crowd."
5579,"I adore British Art and am learning to understand the mastery of John Constable. Flatford and the surrounding countryside is beautiful. Most importantly, it is alive. Plenty of swimmers in or paddle boarders on the river, families picnicking, farmers busy trying to make a livelihood, country lanes being walked but the RSPB area closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. My visit was everything I expected without being excluded because of severe disability."
5580,"Hotel America is located in Rue Notre Dame, a level one way street, 2 roads back from La Croisette/ sea front. I travelled by public transport on the Cannes Express 210 bus. This departs from Nice Airport every 30 minutes during the day and the bus serves both Terminals 1 and 2 in both directions. The bus itself is a coach. There are 3 - 4 steps up at the entrance and a sign by the front door showing a person with a stick. In the middle door is a wheelchair sign. On the way there the driver was very helpful, saw me with my crutch and straight away asked (in French and then in English) to put my suitcase on the bus. On the way back the driver just opened the boot and I had to bend down to put my case in. The journey cost 33 euros return (2017) and journey time via a motorway took about 40 minutes. 
The bus stop in Cannes is by the Hotel de Ville. It is then a 8 - 10 minute level walk with my suitcase to the hotel. On the return journey the bus can be picked up at the end of the road where the hotel is on Rue des Serbes, so just 1 minutes' walk away. However while I was staying there were road works and on my return journey I had to board the bus outside Cannes train station. 
Cannes train station is a 5 - 8 minute walk away, the route between the station and hotel involves a slight slope downwards, however as I didn't use the train I'm unable to comment. I chose the bus as the nearest train station to Nice Airport is a local bus or a taxi ride away, the Express 210 seemed to be the easiest option.
Please be aware the hotel itself is on a quiet side street but La Croisette which you walk along from the Hotel de Ville is busy. Also please be aware while most pavements have dropped kerbs, there are a couple places when one side of the street has a dropped kerb and the other side doesn't. 
Sorry unable to comment about parking or taxis as I didn't use them, but taxis seemed to be plentiful but I believe they are quite expensive,"
5581,Aesthetically this shell house is beautiful the way the shelves and the crystals are arranged is magical and obviously this place was incredibly special for someone in the past it is disabled accessible but there are no toilets for anybody and a car park it is quite boggy at this time of year. 
5582,"For a countryside, woodland path I found it very good. The paths are well maintained and only one area was steep but there is an option of a zig zagging less steep path instead. There are a few benches dotted around the lake and it is about a one mile walk in total."
5583,At the front of the building was a parking place for a car. It was about a 10 minute walk/ wheelchair ride to the train station. There was a bus stop at the end of the street.
5584,Parking at front is good with a paved area for wheelchairs and path to rear of property
5585,"Access from car park via ramp to main door, so very straight forward. But it happened to start raining when I started to climb the ramp - can't help these things! - so a bit uncomfortable in my scooter. But, otherwise, no problems!"
5586,"Although the main toilets under and behind main stairs were lovely and large and wide (ladies), I think to allow formal dresses, it is worth phoning to check latest info, or latest review."
5587,"good accessible, clean toilets just getting to them through clothes rails and signs being difficult to find letting them down a bit"
5588,All on the flat and very easy to get around in powerchair. Would be a wee bit of a walk if you can't walk long distances. Gift shop and smaller shop and pizza place were closed
5589,"Most bridges have sloped access to the canal towpath and easy open/close gates, but not all, so best to drive along route and pick ones with car parks."
5590,All the staff and crew were all very helpful.
5591,"With a manual wheelchair, I can reach the toilet myself, and transfer on my own thanks to he handles. I always bring my own hand sanitizer."
5592,"I have been there at least 3 times and every time there is something different to see. Great place to go with the family. Museum stuff usually run educational talks from time to time so go on their website if you wish, I would highly recommend doing so.
"
5593,"Although there was no changing places loo, the toilets in the Cromlix were quite spacious and extremely clean. "
5594,"Generally, the access was superb and had been really well considered. My only minor quibble was that there was gravel. If you were just renting one cottage, you wouldn't be affected at all and most of the cottages are connected by a pathway. But there was one small cottage I found difficult to get to independently."
5595,"Other than at the Disabled toilets, access to the walkway and beach were was good, although the latter were a bit spread out along the beach.  Where they were, the access was very good"
5596,"Good level access to all parts of the centre, both inside & outside. No steps or ramps & with plenty of room for wheelchairs. The only critiscism would be that the seating in the cafe is rather close together, making it a tad difficult with a wheelchair."
5597,Buses stop near Queen's University and there is some on street parking but unsure about restrictions.
5598,"All staff we met are well trained and friendly, supportive of disabled."
5599,"Very attentive, friendly although not overly so, everything that we needed was dealt with straight away."
5600,"Every area is accessible, but sometimes access routes are obstructed or locked by security."
5601,"Only the ground floor is accessible to wheelchair users. Not good, and not at all in keeping with either the spirit or the letter of the Equality Act 2010. "
5602,"Flat entrance which is suitable for both manual and electric wheelchairs, a disabled toilet and very friendly and accommodating staff."
5603,Parking next to front door. Driveway is gravel and full of puddles when it rains. No transport links.
5604,"Next to Dawlish Station there is step free access to the sea wall under railway bridge. There is now a smooth path along the sea front. It's a massive improvement from previously. There are also some seating along the route, which was very much appreciated. It's much easier to walk along now. "
5605,National trust property that could and should do better
5606,We got the train to London. Ask for special assistance when when you book then they provide ramps. We weren't brave enough to try bus or tube so took taxis and they well equipped for wheelchairs...but expensive!
5607,"There is no step free access and there are 2 steps without a handrail into the café. At the entrance there is a sign asking people to queue. However, when we arrived we didn't need to queue up.

The café is quite small. It consists of 2 ground floor rooms. The first room also contains the cake counter, at standing height. There is a second room at the back but we didn't go in it. There is some outdoor table and chairs at the front of the café, which is accessed by a single step.

The table and chairs are free standing. The chairs are dining chair style with a supportive back rest."
5608,Car park at back of venue
5609,"Great car parking in the centre of Birmingham, easy to find with clear signs. Once inside there are 3 floors with plenty of spaces. On floor 3, the level we used as it was the level with straight access to the Hippodrome Theatre, there was a whole wall with a very colourful graffiti style mural which was a nice touch.
It had lifts to all floors and clear signs as to what each floor gave access to.
It’s one downfall is the lack of disabled parking spaces."
5610,Friendly staff and easily accessible. I have been back twice already!
5611,"Accessible toilet with room to move around in and fit a carer in.
Plenty of grab rails.
Found the emergency red cord hanging freely to the floor and left a Red Cord Card. 
It was clean and tidy.
There was also no pedal bins which is great when you don't have full use of your legs as I've found in so many accessible loos pedal bins and they you're left wondering how to open the bin!
There was also a good size clinical waste pin.
The toilets where easy-ish to find."
5612,"The wet room is amazing. Raised toilet, hand rails wherever you may need them, a sink I can actually use from the chair and not get wet! The shower is lovely and although I didn’t need to use it, the shower chair was a really helpful addition. It’s only 4 stars purely because I couldn’t use the en-suite. Not fair really since the wet room was so good, but I don’t want to give unreal expectations if someone wants to use all areas of the cottage. "
5613,This is a venue with excellent access and friendly and accommodating staff and easily accessed by various modes of transport.
5614,There is a large accessible toilet which you can access on arrival. Large and the toilet flush is also easy to reach.
5615,Everybody we spoke to was super helpful!
5616,"Platform 2 (for trains travelling from Johnstone to stations towards Ayr / Largs / Adrossan is accessed via a footbridge. This bridge has several flights of stairs therefore getting from the car park to platform 2 is difficult for people with restricted mobility or who use a walking aid and impossible for those using a wheelchair. That said, there is alternate access to platform 2 through a housing estate (ramped access) or from the Main Street. Unfortunately, neither of these entrances offers car parking facilities. "
5617,"Disabled loo inside ""no entry"" area, no signage to disabled loo, some might not realise there's another loo, can feel self conscious of asking when not visibly disabled. Actual loo very large, good turning circle to left of loo (as sat). One fixed vertical rail to L, one drop down rail to L, one fixed vertical and fixed horizontal to R.  Good access to basin paper, dryer, emergency cord hangs  to floor. Standard loos down stairs - approx 16 straight stairs, rails both sides"
5618,Large car park but only 1 disabled space
5619,"The normal size.
I have not seen a changing room there. "
5620,"They've tried really hard and the ramp down from the door at the Commercial St entrance, although pretty steep and requiring a 90  degree turn, is great (as long as you have brakes!). Unfortunately the door frame at the bottom still presented a slight obstacle to me as it was too high to bump/drive over in my scooter. Fortunately my dad was able to lift me over - and I'm sure the staff would have helped if I'd been on my own."
5621,Helpful staff
5622,Spacious and modern 
5623,"the loos are terrible, only two on the whole site were big enough to turn around in, and also to transfer,  the others were either dirty, no emergency cord, loo roll half way up the wall, flush on wrong side, narrow door way, slippery floor, dripping taps, air dryers great for drying  hair not good for hands,  emergency pull in corners not accessible, the list goes on, "
5624,"There is disabled parking in the pedestrianised parts of Lancaster very close to the museum. There is ramp access for those that cannot make the 5 steps up to the main entrance.

The museum bare so secret artefacts found  in 2005 as well as the Kings Own Royal regiments Museum. If you have visited the Castle and the priory church then this is close by to visit too and there are some great coffee shops in the vicinity too"
5625,Per another user we visited in late August with hopes to be able to access the gardens with the knowledge that we probably would not be able to access the house itself. There is a ramp out of  the courtyard but the gravel immediately after the ramp makes it very challenging for wheelchair or power wheelchair to even access the gardens themselves. There is also a challenge in the gardens themselves with additional gravel paths. We could only access the courtyard and the shop (and the disabled toilet) in our visit. 
5626,Pub 2 of the first day of my accessibility pub crawl in Broughty Ferry. Has a lovely hidden outdoor seating area and is a busy pub on a Friday and Saturday night with great music.
5627,"My Dad and I drove and arrived early so may have missed the majority of the traffic. It is in a residential area, which means there aren't many routes out of the stadium. This didn't bother me as much as it could of done - we saw a good game with many highlights to chat about!

There's a car park with good number of spaces at the bottom of the lane, to the left of the club shop. This is 30secs from where we watched the game and there was no great cram to her in. You see: there' are benefits to the stadium being so tightly packed. Once you're there, you're there: you don't have to wander around endlesssly to try and locate everything."
5628,"The stewards were polite and helpful, indicating where we had to go immediately. People working in the concourse did their job. The stewards in the stadium held back people over-enthusiastically celebrating, which you cannot always guarantee. All in all people were helpful."
5629,The Gyle centre has accessible toilets in the main concourse.
5630,"One of the big chains of cinemas, the Vue Cinema in Stirling has 8 screens and shows all the latest films.
We found it to be accessible by wheelchair, and staff were friendly. "
5631,"Our host Michael was first rate - attentive, pleasant, helpful. He made our visit run smoothly despite the lift. He came to see us at the interval and returned my chair promptly at the end."
5632,"Parking is an issue in Blackpool and there are restrictions in places .
Most of the large hotels have there own car park if you are staying in Blackpool might be better to leave car  and use trams.
The travel card that you can purchase to cover days is also accepted on the bus as well."
5633,Taking a stroll (a wheel) along George Street the door was open and accessible so time to explore.
5634,"Wetroom with good facilities, toilet raider available "
5635,"Great input by enthusiastic and knowledgeable coaches. As a player who competes, it is still vital to take part in general sessions and also great to see new players developing. Sessions are for all levels of wheelchair player, whether you just fancy a taster or want to go further."
5636,"We found all paths to be wide and smooth.  There were a number of gradients but my wife pushed my chair up these with relative easy, only adoption the 'zig zag' approach once"
5637,"Very friendly, very welcoming and could not be more helpful."
5638,The car park is right at the top.  The site has a visitor bus as it is big and the ramp was ready in 2 seconds and no fuss 
5639,loo in courtyard and main house
5640,"Cannes has a sandy beach (unlike Nice which has a pebble beach). The beach has free, public areas as well as private areas where you have to pay an admission charge to access and which have beachside restaurants. There is a free section of the beach by Palais des Festivals and there is a ramp to access it.
The beach front road is lined with palm trees, which have lights round their trunks and are illuminated at night.
On the beach side there is a wide, flat, pedestrianised walkway which has quite a lot of seats. Some is fixed seating but there is also the blue, metal chairs that are moveable. When I visited I found that at busy times, ie weekend and sunset, it was quite difficult to find an empty chair. It is dotted with kiosks that sell food and drink.
Near Palais des Festivals is a small, children's amusement area with a couple of rides and is very family friendly, and the start of Le Petit Train de Cannes.
On the opposite side of the street are the designer shops, luxury hotels and apartments.
Generally La Croisette is easy to navigate as there are regular crossings from on side of the street to the other. However I did notice that occasionally there would be a drop kerb one side of the road but not on the opposite side."
5641,"Staff throughout the museum were adorable, and always keen to be helpful in any way possible. The Italian lady in charge of the café is very appreciative of being spoken to in Italian. I think I made her day."
5642,"There is an accessible toilet just beside the stations main entrance door. It does have a sign on the door, but otherwise I didn't think it was overly obvious it was there - when I asked, staff happily pointed it out.

It opens with a radar key, but if you ask the staff they will open it for you if you don't have a key yourself.

This is the only public toilet, so does get used by everyone not only those with access needs. In a station as busy as this it's a shame there aren't a few more toilets. (there are also 2 toilets in the Morrisons cafe).

It was a functional accessible toilet - not the prettiest, but clean enough. If using a bigger power wheelchair and if you also needed a carer with you, I think space would be fairly tight, though possible.

The toilet had a fixed support bar on the wall to your right (when sitting on the toilet) and a raise/lower support bar to your left.
There were additional support bars on the walls. 

There is a hand-drier machine on the wall.

The emergency cord reached the floor. "
5643,Very close to Pimlico underground station. 
5644,"As far as the cinema goes, the washrooms smelled of methane or ammonia during all of my visits. The food was relatively poor quality and parts of the business (e.g. bar area) are worn and ugly by current standards."
5645,"Clear signage is available all through the centre, with directions to all facilities including accessible toilets. There are multiple lifts throughout the centre, which are spacious enough to be able to turn in a mobility aid as well as have someone with you. All shops and facilities have step free access, although some individual shops and restaurants are sometimes not as accessible, for example shop aisles being too close together. The main centre itself is very spacious, with smooth, mostly flat flooring throughout. There are automatic doors for both street entrances and exits as well as manual doors "
5646,"No disabled parking available.

The Spondon Flyer & Ilkeston Flyer stop near by. "
5647,It is a working horse yard so there’s mud and dung to be expected. The people on site were very helpful and I didn’t have any troubles. 
5648,Wheelchair accessible with helpful and friendly staff. Food is good and reasonably priced. Have eaten on many occasions and have not been let down.
5649,Staff were very helpful with explaining the options and bringing the food over to our table for us.
5650,The staff are very helpful a postman held the door open to let me in and the man who went and got the parcel made sure that I would be okay holding the box. Then also held the door open to let me back out there was room to turn the chair round in the collection area.
5651,"Having met several staff during my visits I can only praise their consideration and knowledge. Help is available for disabled customers in a wide range of ways. Staff are able to help with things like high visibility payment cards, induction loops, online banking with BSL, talking cash machines and more."
5652,"Parking on level at start of the pier, but we took a taxi for convenience."
5653,plenty parking at the croft
5654,Accommodation has excellent wet room and accessible loo
5655,"The hotel was very nice and the staff were an added bonus. Upon arrival we were discretely offered an accessible room without asking, we refused as we wanted to test a basic room. Throughout our stay, each member of staff was attentive, patient and friendly."
5656,"There is level access to the service. There is not a hearing assistance system. This venue does not play background music.
Motorised scooters are allowed in public parts of the venue. The lighting levels are varied.

Not all exhibits can be audio described with tactile signage for exhibits is available and touch tours are available.

The availability of touch tours depends on exhibition. There is a fixed loop hearing assistance system.  Staff are definitely trained to use the hearing system. 

You can have a wheelchair to borrow but check availability on arrival with the foyer staff.

Many of the exhibits are available to handle. Talks are given on some exhibitions and some of the talks are BSL interpreted."
5657,"All the external doors have automatic opening buttons, however these are fairly regularly out of order. The doors are extremely heavy without these. There is lift access to all floors, however the Singing Lift is very hard to find on Level One, and needs some signage. The lifts become very slow during peak times."
5658,The entrance has a large sweeping ramp to wheelchair users are not banished to a side entrance. The foyer is open with the box office at a good height. Access to the theatre is straight forward and the accessible seating is right by the doorway.
5659,Step-free access but the staff have to open that door. That's not a problem as you are very visible when waiting so it's quick and helpful.
5660,"The new Leisure center has a new kitted out gym where 33% of the gym equipment has been made wheelchair compatible with pull out seat and height adjustable machines.  Your carer can go free.

The pool has a lift the steam room and sauna are easily accessible.  new fully fitted disabled changing rooms and toilets.

They really had the disabled in for front of mind when designing the facility.  Would recommend Highly."
5661,"The restaurant is really good, it is spacious from the main door to the tables.  There  are selections of tables that are easy accessible for wheelchairs. They have one disabled toilet that is reasonably accessible."
5662,There's an accessible loo inside the cafe/visitor centre.
5663,"The staff are very welcoming and kind,caring and nice to everyone."
5664,"Stairs to rooms, and Old part of hotel, but these are accessed via lift as previously mentioned, was quite narrow, otherwise everywhere flat.
Signage could have been better, but there was always someone available to request help, or ask directions
Did not notice any induction loops, but Braille assistance panel in bathrooms.
As previously mentioned plenty seating throughout public areas, but none when exiting lifts, would recommend requesting a room near lifts for mobility problems, as corridors very long"
5665,Traverse is fab - from booking our tickets to visiting the venue last night everything worked brilliantly.  The theatre and bar area are downstairs but there is a spacious lift that managed to fit all 6 of us in! Staff super helpful when booking tickets - not phased at all about access requirements. When we arrived we spoke to the folk organising the queue and they told us where to wait and then we were collected and taken into the auditorium and to our seats. The venue is free seating but they had reserved us seats so the whole party could sit together. I love the Traverse anyway - but this was the first time that I had gone to a show with my pal who uses a powerchair - and it was seamless! 
5666,"We drove there and found quite a few disabled spaces dotted around the town centre; we parked opposite the police station and meandered through Poitiers which was about a ten minute wander from there to the church.  Meandering is highly recommended as there are lots of architectural treasures, museums and shops throughout Poitiers.
There is a train station but it was at the foot of the city and it would be a steep uphill climb and although there are buses, I'm not sure if they were accessible. "
5667,Signs for disabled access clear. Lift to upper level. 
5668,The main car park was very busy and we didn't find a space.  Had to park on the street some half a mile up the hill.
5669,Very pleasant & helpful. 
5670,"There was a good size accessible toilet with grab rails it was very clean and the lighting is good and will come on as you enter the toilet. 
The Toilet is on the ground floor level area past the café and is on the left hand side as you go towards the toilet 
The only issue was that the red cord was short and by about 2 feet from the floor a Red cord card is in place "
5671,There were not many disabled spaces but did manage to get one. They were near restaurant. 
5672,"Admission is still free to visit Wellcome but you must to pre-book. On their website there is a link to the Eventbrite booking page. The bookings are in 15 minute time slots, however once you arrive you can move about the building freely and stay as long as you want. When you book via Eventbrite there is a question about access needs and there is the option to reply on Eventbrite or by email. Alternatively you can telephone and book a slot. Nearer the time I was due to visit, I got a reminder email and it included a helpful checklist of things to bring, such as they ask you to bring your own headphones.

I booked a 11 - 11.15am slot for the first Thursday of their re-opening. When  I arrived I was able to walk straight in and there wasn't a queue. The middle entrance door is push button. Directly in front are a short flight of stairs with a handrail. At the bottom of the stairs is hand sanitiser and a sign saying check in and keep to the right. There is also a platform lift. Next to it is a container which has hand sanitiser wipes at the top and a bin below. There is another one when you exit the lift.

At the top of the stairs is the main foyer. There is a check in point with clear screen and a bag search table. The information desk is still there and that also has a clear screen. Previously to the left of the stairs has been a seating area. Most of the seats have been removed and when I visited there was only one low bench without back support or arms in the far corner. When I stood up after sitting I struggled with my transfers and it took a couple of goes before I was upright.  There was also low, no back bench seating downstairs, at ground floor level, and some on the first floor between the Being Human and the Medical Man galleries. Please can you provide  alternative seating in these area which is higher and with a supportive back rest which would make it easier for people with a mobility impairment to transfer safely. Thank you.

The cafe is open and all the food on offer is pre-packed but the food is still of the good, high quality it was before. They have extended the seating area in the cafe. The free standing table and chairs are well spaced out. Sadly the book shop and restaurant are currently closed.

There is still step free access around the building. There are notices saying if you can use the stairs please do so. There are floor signs for where to stand for the lift and hand sanitiser. They ask that you only use the lift with your group.

The gallery next to the information desk, which houses temporary exhibitions, is currently closed. The Being Human and Medical Man exhibitions are on the first floor. The audio description guides, BSL interpretation, large print guides and magnifiers are still available at the entrance to both galleries. Also too are the fold up stools. The objects are cleaned between users.

Also there are 2 separate areas with videos, with captions, of people talking about how covid has impacted on their lives. I found these very interesting and very moving too. Where ""What does it mean to be human now? Four views by CYP x CALLY"" exhibition in the Forum had some wonderfully accessible and comfortably designed wooden chairs with built in headphone socket, to enable you to listen to the audio."
5673,"No individual car park but public car park about 50 yards away with 2 disabled spaces, just across from paisley Gilmour st train station"
5674,"The disabled toilets are on the ground floor, easily accessible in my power chair, spotlessly clean and tidy with lots of space and grab rails. Lovely hand-wash! I deducted half a star simply because the paper towels were packed so tightly into the dispenser that each one tore as I tried to remove it. "
5675,"Step free entrance, plenty of space around tables, good amount of room at counter. Spacious.  "
5676,"Staff as always lived up to their name of being welcoming, friendly and approachable."
5677,"There are two disabled parking bays down at the beach.  Discussions with the local authority are ongoing about getting a third parking bay.  In the summer, Coldingham bay can be very busy and you may find that these bays may be occupied on arrival.  If this is the case we recommend that the wheelchair user is let out at the parking bays and the driver takes the car upto the main carpark.   However, we realise that this may not be feasible but unfortunately the project does cannot reserve a parking bay"
5678,"There are three steps without a railing  to access the building. Once inside the restaurant is all on one level, and is also very spacious allowing plenty of space to manoeuvre a wheelchair."
5679,Really helpful and friendly.
5680,"The staff were lovely but the store itself is rubbish.  My dad walks with a stick, very slowly because of a lung condition and can't stand for any length of time.  In the store (which we had to use as he has a contract with EE) there were low, backless stools to sit on (he can't get down that far) or high 'breakfast bar' stools at bars.  Absolutely nothing for anyone who just needs a standard hight chair (ideally with arms, but he could have managed without that at a pinch).  Sorting out a phone is a long process, so he had to lean against one of the high stools for half an hour, clearly uncomfortable but with no other option.  
It took him the rest of the day to recover.  
Only go to EE if you are a bright young thing who is fit and healthy:  they clearly don't care in the least about older customers or anyone with limited mobility."
5681,Disabled spaces are right outside the door into the cafe & deli & the car park is tarmac.
5682,Although the pub itself has no disabled bays there is a large car park adjacent to the beer garden with plenty of space.
5683,"The toilets had everything I needed. There is a large changing table which can be brought down from the wall and plenty of grab rails etc, as well as a ceiling hoist. "
5684,"Large disabled toilet, easily enough room for a wheelchair and carer. Toilet just outside auditorium on ground floor."
5685,"Following a drive through countryside around Warwick, you arrive at the Grange, and entering via a barrier you find the disabled bays in front of you by the hotels entrance. When going to exit hotel, pick up the pass number required to lift barriers from reception desk. It’s free for those who use their facilities."
5686,"For this review of the Spa, then we can only offer a few marks, although to be fair it’s a lovely drive to get to the hotel, and along to the hotel itself where one disabled bay is available right by the hotels entrance, but it is quite a walk from hotel to the separate Spa and health club. You cannot drive down to see the Spa, so bear this in mind."
5687,Spacious and well signed blue badge parking.
5688,"We drove, parking for our accessible vehicle was very spacious.  You would need to have transport."
5689,There isn't parking at the side but there is a car park directly opposite that I fairly priced 
5690,"There's a pretty pond, loos, parking and picnic area at this former quarry on the Wall.  A short but steep track takes you up to the Wall trail. There and back outing was about a mile and a quarter - you need a sturdy set of motorised wheels and help if you get stuck going up the hill (I did!). Worth the effort for views and ruins."
5691,"No dedicated parking, but lots of on street parking ( we go early not the busy lunchtimes)"
5692,"The food is amazing for a lover of chicken wings and the staff are friendly and willing to help. However, it lacks wheelchair access at almost every point it can. Its in the centre of town meaning parking is difficult. The restaurant is situated on a steep cobbled hill again reducing access. As you enter there is no ramp only a series of steep steps. Inside the restaurant similarly there is reduced space for anyone with reduced mobility. Furthermore there is no disabled toilets or changing facility and even then the toilets provided are very small and difficult to move in. This is a shame as the food is of a high standard and all of these factors mean it would be hard for a person with a wheelchair to enjoy.   "
5693,"There is a disabled toilet and a cafe in Register House, which is wheelchair accessible."
5694,"The staff were excellent, very attentive and helpful.
"
5695,"Parking for the retail park is good,and some near each shop"
5696,"There are accessible toilets in the building. However, it is located at the back, near the cafe which might not be easily located. Space within the toilet was sufficient for moving around. "
5697,Always greeted when passing through the lobby.  Very friendly and helpful staff in restaurant and at breakfast.
5698,Clean. Easy to get to.morror too high as usual.
5699,"It is clean, it's nice but the drinks were expensive"
5700,Parking is not brilliant being at the top end of the Royal Mile ( a fairly steep hill).
5701,The toilets were good - spacious and clean
5702,helpful and informative
5703,"Not easily accessible for wheelchair users. No disabled toilet. However for the more mobile there is level access, seating & toilets all on one level. The overall rating also reflects the fact that I've had better steak & drinks are rather expensive. "
5704,Good. Go up the ramp but you need to get a member of staff to open the access foot. We did this by waving through the window - it's quite a walk to get to the main entrance to find a staff member if you have  to leave your wheelchair user alone at the top of the ramp. If you know how the system works it's OK & works well.
5705,"This bar is located almost  on the corner of Queen Street and Frederick Street. It is a short walk from frequent bus stops on Princes Street and the pavements are wide and level. There is on-street parking available on Queen Street, although we didn't use this so can't comment on accessibility."
5706,Disabled ground floor toilet. Although it is not obvious to find (back left). Good amount of room to manoeuvre. Has grab rails. Clean and tidy. Space for carer but might be quite tight. Has a changing place aswell. Upstairs toilets were shut at the time so cannot comment.
5707,"Access is good with level, smooth, surfaces."
5708,"Lifts to all levels in the public parts of the Gasometers, which are linked by accessible glass bridges. A level footpath takes you right round the complex - well worth the walk to admire this skilful conversion of old industrial buildings."
5709,There is no parking in this area however Princess St is only a minute or so away and has buses going to a range of places. There is also the trams as well that run between Edinburgh Airport and York St.  Waverly train station is also near to the venue so this gives us a good train service available.
5710,"A large forest in the heart of the North Lakes. The roads up to the forest are quite steep but there are flat parts of road that give breathtaking views over towards Penrith and Carlisle. The parking is at the bottom of a small slope that leads up to a small shop/visitor centre with a cafe (indoor and outdoor seating). There is a tramper trail that I found accessible for my powered wheelchair. There were however some parts that I did not like. For example, after the visitor centre there is a steep slope leading down to the start of the trail and at the start of the trail there is a small curb that is manageable for powered wheelchairs with curb climbing capabilities. Some of the path is very steep but again my powered wheelchair was able to manage them (it was me who was less confident with the gradients). When I went, which was in July, it had rained the day before so there was quite a lot of mud and at some points there is thick mud in the middle of the path but it is wide enough to go to the side to avoid this.  The trail is 2.5miles (according to the Whinlatter website) and loops back around to the visitor centre for a well earned lunch. "
5711,"Accessible loo, good limited food access, some steps"
5712,There are no steps only a very slight ramp to the door and no changes pf level  inside. All doors are wide enough for even large  wheelchairs
5713,"Toilets ok with grab rails, etc, but doors too heavy and difficult to use with rollator/walker."
5714,Has 2 Disabled bays near door. 
5715,Only 2. Free In the multi storey nearby with blue badge 
5716,We drove and there is free Blue Badge parking. Can get busy though and sometimes all the outdoor disabled parking spaces are full. There is a multi storey car park attached to the shopping outlet centre. There are buses that stop at the Galleria but I'm unsure if they are wheelchair accessible.
5717,"There was a ramp into the building, and the rest of the building is flat. The highlight for us was the wheelchair accessible jungle gym which my son spent ages driving up, down and around. The first time in his 16 years of life he could 'climb' a jungle gym on his own. The rest of the equipment was designed to accommodate special needs children with assistance e.g. jumping castles, wheely-boards and swings they can lie on or be propped up on."
5718,Very friendly and chatty! 
5719,Really friendly and helpful. Wee problem with the accessibility of the room but they did everything they could to help.
5720,"The toilets are accessible, but at times especially after the game, rather wet floors"
5721,The steam train goes from Fort William to Mallaig going over the Glenfinnan Viaduct.
5722,"We found ordinary toilets which were nice and clean, but cubicles were rather narrow, so had to leave wheelchair outside and walk in, however, by chance we did see disabled toilet later on near to reception desk, but a bit late then."
5723,"The disabled access toilet is on the ground floor just behind reception, through a door which has a sign saying members only area. Due to it's location the person with a disability would have to ask a member of staff to gain access to the toilet. The toilet has grab rails, reasonably spacious and well maintained. The main toilets are in the basement and accessible by lift, but I didn't use these."
5724,"Access loo is disappointing, it has dual purpose as baby changing also, which eats into the turning space. The big nappy bins take up lots of the floor space. This was not adequate for me to use with assistance. 

I will have to plan carefully and time it, so i won't need to use the loo. A bit off putting. 
 "
5725,"All the many staff we encountered were adorably helpful, friendly, courteous and professional. Top marks!"
5726,"Whilst the venue had a bus stop, there was no scheduled buses operating to and from it. Closest bus stop with a scheduled bus service was 1.5 miles away, along a route not suitable for wheelchairs (part of route with no pavement, no drop-down kerb where pavement ends and pavement recommences), the footpath from the railway bridge has a full width gate that is locked, and a side zig zag that is very hard to get a wheelchair around. One path also has a boulder which reduces the width, only way to pass with wheelchair is to ride into the nettles next to the path.

Parking, there are 10 disabled parking bays provided at the front, but these bays are 2400mm wide with no wheelchair hatched areas, which makes them unsuitable for wheelchair users when the venue is busy. "
5727,"All staff were very pleasant and took the trouble to go through a Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan in case of emergency which all hotels should do and very few do.
"
5728,Great loo but its at the back of the shop so quite tricky to get to
5729,"The entry to King Koby is glass double doors that open outwards manually. They're fairly light weight, & just one was plenty wide enough for the powered wheelchair. There is a small ramp up to the otherwise flat shop floor.
The waiting area is wooden benches which are unfortunately inaccessible from a wheelchair, but there is room to park on the end.
The shop floor is spacious, & you may choose to remain in your wheelchair if you wish.
The payment counter is a little high, but the card machine can come loose & be passed to you.
I'm unsure about toilet access, but being in the city centre disabled toilets are available in nearby shopping centres for sure.
Staff are super friendly, helpful, & completely unphased by disability.
There is disabled parking directly outside, a taxi rank, & multiple nearby bus stops. Some of the pavements are uneven, but passable in a wheelchair."
5730,Very helpful and friendly
5731,large car park with a few Disable parking bays near the front door .. Bus Service stops at the ASDA store across the road 
5732,Accessible toilets can be found near the VIP lounge. They are clean & spacious.
5733,"There's automated doors at the entrance. Then immediately in front of you is a staircase and a platform lift to take you to the main floor. The exhibition is on the same floor as reception, the café and bookshop. 
The exhibition space has manual entrance and exit doors. The exhibition is divided into 3 sections. 
The Medium, which looks at the late 1800s and early 1900s interest in communicating with the spirit world and seances. 
Misdirection about magic and deception.
Mentalism with mind reading and mind control stunts.
The exhibition has lots of fascinating items on display, including Houdini's handcuffs, Tommy Cooper’s fez and Paul Daniels’s sawing-in-half box.
The exhibition is well laid out and is spacious. However, from the entrance you have to walk through all The Medium and most of the Misdirection sections to the furthest wall before there is any seating. When you do arrive at the seating there is a lot of it. I raised it with staff on the night, as I thought for the preview they might have wanted to create extra space to accommodate the visitor numbers. I was told that is how the exhibition is but they would raise it and see if the seating inside could be improved. There are fold up stools you can collect at the exhibition entrance, but for some of us a firm fixed seat is best for our transfers. I'm sure the Wellcome will work quickly to address this. there are 2 other places when there is the opportunity to sit. All the seating is bench style without back support but some have arms.
Overall the lighting levels are quite low. 
There are a number of videos to watch some on small screens and others on large ones, all have subtitles. I thought the sound levels were about right, and I didn't find the noise levels of the videos too loud but that might feel differently when the gallery is less busy."
5734,Straightforward for us. Staff were very helpful directing us where to go and holding open doors etc.
5735,Friendly and helpful.
5736,The parking was very very good we could  park outside the hotel and take my stuff out the car
5737,This is some distance away in Hallgraig St and is a good 5 minutes plus if you are walking or in a chair
5738,"The toilets were passable, however the venue had lost their radar key when we arrived, luckily I had mine. The disabled loo was difficult to get in and felt a bit like a dumping ground. "
5739,"Sloping access and plenty of lifts inside, also resting points. Signage was good, but most of all, the staff are welcoming and friendly. "
5740,The staff were all so helpful
5741,"There is a free carpark just next to the park , with several marked disabled bays. Be aware, that when events are on at the Park, it can be very busy, and car-parking can be difficult.
The park isn't far from the High Street/shops, and can be walked to from there (where there is also more parking available)

There are buses to the High Street - I am unsure if they come closer to the Park than that.

The nearest train station is Dalreoch, but this 
station is inaccessible if using a wheelchair. The next closest is Dumbarton Central which is accessible (though very steep ramps), and bit further away from Park. "
5742,All the staff I met were helpful and friendly. I would encourage people to contact the hotel prior to booking as they were very willing to help where they could. They can also tell you more about what’s available.
5743,Plenty of disabled spaces near to lifts
5744,Access was great.
5745,"There is a ramp to access front door, assisted opening door inside building.
Café area is spacious and can easily accommodate a wheelchair."
5746,"The entrance is step-free, there's an accessible toilet, it's easy to get around the café and the staff are zealous in their attempts to be helpful.  Definitely worth considering as a place to go if you're a wheelchair user, despite my negative comments below."
5747,Jennifer and her sister could not do enough to help us.
5748,Friendly and helpful staff.
5749,"We were getting a bit desperate as other hotels with accessible rooms were all booked up so I was apprehensive about the quality of the accommodation. I need not have worried, there was a good wet room with lots of grab rails. The access to the hotel was gently ramped. Mobility Scooters are not allowed in the rooms or dining room, but they can be charged under the stairs in the hallway. The restaurant is easily accessible. The food is exceptional. The management were pleased that they had been awarded a rosette . It was well deserved. The emphasis is on seafood. The location is  on the seafront adjacent to the towns event centre. We went out onto the amazingly wide promenade after breakfast and I enjoyed a long ride on my Mobility scooter to the foot of the Great Orme. I have held back half a star because the reception rooms looked tired, but that is about to change as the hotel is to be closed this month for downstairs refurbishment. There is free WiFi in the rooms, and the hotel is dog friendly."
5750,"Wow stunning. Where to start! Extra wide doors, smooth access into the accommodation. A vestibule with cupboard space, hooks for jackets and space for outdoor shoes, parking buggy, extra wheelchair or walkers. Also has seat that would allow anyone wanting a bit time alone, space enough to sit. Spacious and bright open plan living, dining and kitchen area.  A profiling arm chair. Ceiling hoist, both in bedroom and wet room. Profiling bed, fab views and patio doors from downstairs bedroom and living area out to the garden. Very airy with amazing amount of light into the property.  Lowered worktop with access for wheelchair user.  Accessible w/c as well as wet room including toilet and basin (the only not so accessible part, from my point of view, being a small sink which is a bit low, with not clear space under for wheelchair access). 3 toilets in a 2 bedroom accommodation is great, no queuing needed. 

Also a fully equipped utility room for any laundry needing done..Large pulley for hanging clothes, and I think, a tumble dryer. Lots of cupboard space too. 

Lots of information available in folders, both about the property and the surrounding areas giving info on accessible places to go. "
5751,I got off the bus on Princes Street and George Street is just behind. There is drop off spots for buses and taxis infront of the door.
5752,"ramp from driveway into bungalow, most bedrooms downstairs with one upstairs. ground floor with good level access throughout"
5753,"The parking is in a public car park or on street parking. The disabled bays are spacious and Ceredigion Council offers free parking to tax exempt vehicles. The unfortunate thing is there is a steep hill to climb to the main high street where the coffee shop is situated. There used to be a lift, but the shop in which it is situated at the back of, is currently closed and up for let. "
5754,"Level access to both entrances. There is a lift that connects the 2 floors which is a good size but could be tight for some longer powerchairs. We didn’t use it to test it out. 

Otherwise Access was good. 

Only drops half a point because I’m not totally sure about the lift. Probably fine but we didn’t try it- see pics for some info. "
5755,"A Changing Places toilet is located very close to the exhibition entrance, on level 1, next to the JCB Glass Lift. However their website says that the key for this room is available from the Welcome Hub, Level 2, Royal Festival Hall. There are accessible toilets on each floor. I didn't use the facilities on this occasion."
5756,As a power wheelchair user I found the access all where we needed to go was great. Nice wide ramps and big lifts so getting around was very easy.
5757,The staff I  met were very helpful and showed me which way to go and helped to explain how the ticketing system worked.
5758,"The disabled access was arranged by the same team that organised disabled access at trnsmt. Firstly, enter the garden via the accessible entrance at King Stables Road then follow the path, which is the least steep path, to the viewing platform. The path led straight to the viewing platform. A member of staff guided us the way. The path is still steep so if you have a scooter or power chair, I would recommend using it! The view from the platform to the stage is brilliant. Space on the platform must be booked in advance."
5759,"Everything we did on the tour, and that was a lot, was accessible due to the careful research of our lovely guide Laura."
5760,Good level access from the Galleries. Fairly good for wheeling around although some spots were a bit tight.
5761,"There is a loo in the swimming pool changing area, which felt a little cramped, but had everything I needed. There is another accessible loo too, which felt less cramped though, as it didn’t have any other equipment in it."
5762,"Clean, tidy, spacious and set up as we found all the U.S. Restrooms. Located within the standard restrooms."
5763,Starbucks is on the ground floor of St Pancras International Station. The nearest tube station is King's Cross and it has step free access. Several buses routes stop very close by.
5764,Overall very accessible - but very hilly - there is a disabilities 'ride' you can call the accessible bus to pick you up
5765,"The O2 Arena in Greenwich is a major venue for events of many kinds, from music to sport. Using the site of the Millennium Dome, it's been designed with excellent access in mind.
As well as the Arena, the site also houses the smaller indigO2, which is accessible though has not been visited for this review, as well as a cinema and exhibition centre. There are also a wide variety of bars and restaurants, all of which are accessible."
5766,Level access into the shop. Seating at the back which can be moved to make space (although its relatively tight). Pretty large accessible loo at the back.
5767,The disabled toilets are near the entrance and are very spacious.
5768,"The entire hotel is wheelchair friendly, easy to enter, move around, lively and with disability aware staff. "
5769,"First problem is there is a reasonably high step at the entrance . a mobility scooter would not be able to cope with height of the step 
My mobility scooter was left outside the building . No issues about the food or the staff . Main complaint was the toilets , there is NOT an accessible toilet . it is a level walk to toilets but once you open the door you have two steps [high] to get up to reach the toilet . the walls are glazed tiles from floor to ceiling ,no rail to hold onto . I had to use my mobile phone to call one of the people from our party so that a female could assist me down the steps"
5770,Staff were extremely nice and wanted to do anything to make my experience more enjoyable.
5771,"We stayed in the Stables which is beautifully converted to a high standard, perfect for wheelchair users or for those with mobility issues. The downstairs bathroom has hand rails, a seat , power shower and a wardrobe with a low level rail.
The house is warm and comfortable and the kitchen has a range oven and a large fridge/freezer so you can easily self cater if you want to. Sarah is there if you need her.
Just outside is a love little garden and access to a great walk. The location is brilliant for sight-seeing. All-in-all couldn't fault it!"
5772,Free parking immediately outside after 6pm.
5773,"Parking is good, it is out of the way for public transport though."
5774,Disabled ramp at front door was fine for me but might be a tight fit for a scooter.
5775,"If you're coming by car, you turn into the main Gleneagles Hotel driveway  and it's before you get to the hotel on the left hand side. There is a Blue Badge parking space right outside the Dormy House. If you're coming by train the nearest station is Gleneagles station."
5776,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately away near Waitrose on Link Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
5777,"Very helpful, we were made to feel really welcome."
5778,"Great accessibility,"
5779,"There are a few nearby car parks with disabled parking bays, and there are multiple bus stops very close to the pub."
5780,"What lets down the airport in my opinion is the car hire companies. Big names at the airport,  Avis, Budget, Enterprise/National/Alamo, Europcar and Hertz and not one offer WAV hire for wheelchair users. 
We got picked up and dropped off so didn't see what other transport options were like."
5781,"Plenty of car parks near by but need to pay. As it’s on the main high street, difficult to drop off outside. "
5782,"I felt confident that all necessary equipment and adaptations would be in place and I was not disappointed. My husband was able to use a fully accessible bathroom, increasing his sense of independence. Highlights were the proximity to Carsington Water, where he was able to take part in Sailability, the rental of a Tramper, again at Carsington and the mighty off road Boma wheelchair, available for hire at Hoe Grange. 
I can recommend the hiring of the wood fired hot tub too!
When we needed help, the owners of the property were able to give me support.
The only thing I found a slight challenge was the lack of a washing machine in the property. There was, however, a machine we could use in the laundry room.
The weather was absolutely beautiful and we will be returning in the near future.
Sue and Steve"
5783,I visited as part of a private taxi tour so I was dropped off at the entrance gates and collected from their too. I don't know about public transport but I think there is a hop on hop off sightseeing busy that stops here.
5784,Not very engaging and when asked for information it was the bare minimum that was given. Other staff we encountered did not appear too interested in our experience as visitors and customers.
5785,Staff are friendly and helpful 
5786,Very nice and helpful if you have any questions.
5787,"Spacious, clean and looked like it has recently been redecorated. The staff all knew about it and noticed that I needed a bit of a hand with the door."
5788,"Totally flat, doors were open, so unsure if automatic.
Some distance to walk round to clinical areas, but volunteer staff on hand to arrange transport in a chair for those with mobility restrictions
Clear signage on floor to guide round what would other wise have been a confusing entry and exit system"
5789,The only staff member we interacted with was the person at the checkout. He wasn't very engaging.
5790,"Staff very helpful, offering to move furniture etc, to aid placement of wheelchair"
5791,"A good bus service passes the door with the nearest stop being 2 minute walk away.
Train station is a 20-30 min walk away."
5792,Located opposite Tesco extra. 
5793,"Good bus links, nearby train station and some on street parking."
5794,"Power assisted door to enter cafe, ramp inside."
5795,Slippy floor and didn't appear to have been checked for cleanliness
5796,"On traipsing along the corridor on our way to eat, I asked reception if  I could get a chair to use whilst at the sink, and this was in place for me coming back from the restaurant.  The receptionist also gave me their direct number should I have any problems (Premier Inns don’t have phones in the room)
This was really good as when I got back to the room,  my keycard failed to work!   A quick call and a replacement was brought along.  Well done the night reception staff.
After a reasonable sleep and shower, I was ready for breakfast and checkout.  Here, I mentioned the long trail to an accessible room to the receptionist.  She agreed that is was a long walk but said had we asked,  could have come in the fire door beside my room, leading out to the carpark!  Should I use this hotel again, I shall bear that in mind"
5797,Really friendly
5798,The staff are not very helpful. The lift that wheelchair users have to use is far away from the entrance what is an inconvenience.
5799,Parking in nearby car park
5800,Plenty of parking adjacent to the promenade.
5801,"There is a disabled toilet on right hand side of main entrance, sign posted well, enough room for a carer."
5802,"Paisley Abbey is a historically significant building in Paisley.
The volunteer staff are very knowledgeable and helpful.   There are ramps in place to access all areas on the ground floor.  There is information through the ages on boards as you walk round the ground floor with lots of pictures.
It has a small café serving hot and cold drinks, icecream and cakes to the right of the entrance which is accessible for wheelchairs and a gift shop."
5803,"Portland Bill lighthouse has a flat path around it which is mainly concrete. You can get down to near the seafront by the same path. It has great views and on a windy day be prepared for sea splashes! The seafront is slightly down hill so you have to go back up to the car park. 
If you had mountain bike tyres you could go to the left of the lighthouse but it is bumpy and not a proper path so wouldn't attempt alone."
5804,Ample Disabled Parking
5805,"easy to find loo, well signed plenty of space."
5806,"Plenty of parking close to the entrance, and three dedicated parking spots for blue badge users. You can park here for free for up to 4 hours, but if you need more time you just sign your car in at reception. This gym is also just a stones throw away from Nottingham train station, making it the perfect place to go if you're travelling via train."
5807,Friendly staff bar height might be an issue but I am sure that this would not be an issue as locally people are friendly and always willing to assist
5808,Flat access into the building with lifts to all floors
5809,"There are toilets by the car park by Debenhams, in Debenhams there are ample disabled loos. Or the cafes have toilets. "
5810,Very welcoming and helpful. Plenty of room at the tables.
5811,Could be better as the area outside is not paved or tarmacked.
5812,Very accessible and very spacious. The smoked glass impairs the view from the wheelchair viewing area. Quite dark in places.
5813,There are 3 blue badge spaces in the middle parking bay. There is a path towards the courtyard which has a fairly steep gradient but is suitable for wheelchairs.
5814,"We were able to park right near the house, as we'd requested this on the booking, but otherwise, you can unload the car on arrival right by the house, and then move the car to a car park within the grounds."
5815,"Staff generally were very helpful but a bit of a mixed bag. We had about four different servers all night but apparently only one of them was allowed to take any food or drink orders, and had to call our waitress over rather than simply take our request for a drink to the bar. This sometimes made staff look a little ignorant as they whizzed past our table ignoring our attention, but our server was indeed very lovely and perfectly happy to answer any questions I had about access."
5816,"The settings were lovely and peaceful, the lodge it's self had everything that was needed for people with disabilities, we had a varied range of needs due to the number of people going. At no point was this an issue and everything was put in place for us. The welcome was wonderful we were shown round and were given plenty of information about the surrounding areas. I would highly recommend this place for anyone that has a disability or who care for someone with a disability "
5817,"Delicious food, will go back!"
5818,"The Crannog Centre is set on Loch Tay, the actual Crannog is out on the water with a walk way made of tree trunks split in half. There is an exhibition which includes findings of the archaeological dig, which our guest found interesting. There is also a corner of dressing up clothes which we all hand some fun with.  Inside the Crannog is a bit dark and the seating is low therefore if someone is easily disorientated take care. The Guided tour is very informative and gives a good insight into life in the Iron age.  Outside the Crannog, there a lot of hands on activities, which people living with dementia enjoyed. We enjoyed the fire-making demonstration. There is a small Café and a gift shop. A good trip that our group enjoyed."
5819,lovely walk on the flat along river starting at Dock honesty cafe(opens 11am)( ask taxi for block 9 Arc apartments) walk along to the Odyysey concert centre and go into Streat cafe. Wonderful photo opportunities!
5820,Edinburgh buses are excellent and well ramped.  Street parking only.  Restaurant is about 300m from Haymarket Railway station. On North side of Dalry Road (right hand side of street walking away from the station)
5821,"Ample parking with designated bays, train or bus is not close, train 750 m bus 500m steep inclines and descents to and from the stadium."
5822,"Taking a short drive from Perth via Aberfeldy and arriving at the tiny village of Kenmore at the extreme Eastern end of Loch Tay, we parked in the first car park overlooking the water.  Beautiful scenery....we walked/scootered the very short distance down to the café.  Seating both inside and outside on the edge of the loch.  Not a restaurant as such but a very nice reasonably priced café with a fairly small menu, all of which is freshly made and well presented by the pleasant staff.  Access is ramped and easily accessible by wheelchair or boot scooter.  Excellent disabled toilet facilities."
5823,"No designated disabled parking, main Carpark at front of hotel, plenty parking, wheelchair access at rear of hotel, and further parking available there, but no signage to reflect this."
5824,All staff exemplary.
5825,Welcome basket was essential and the owners friendly and helpful
5826,The staff themselves are very kind and supportive and would be willing to help even though the facility reduces access to most disabled clients.
5827,Bus stops a few hundred yards away. Taxis also. No parking that I know of.
5828,"Mostly level, interesting views, almost all is accessible in a wheelchair, power chair, walking aid. If you can get to the bird hide you might see kingfishers. The tearoom has a huge array of home made cakes and there are plants for sale. Check the website for more details. https://www.gooderstonewatergardens.co.uk/ "
5829,Parking was availble on site next to the cottage. 
5830,Accessible and interactive 
5831,Level access throughout and a lift.
5832,"Staff are outside and will take you in a side entrance which has a built in ramped hallway to a small lift, which then takes you to the correct level. Winding corridors and turns but nice and light. Toilet is behind a fire exit door so not usually misused. Low toilet but there is a clip on seat raiser to take the toilet to wheelchair height. Very hilly in auditorium which was an issue to to my core strength as you tilt sideways to access the seats and then have to sit at an angle in your chair if in row O otherwise the person behind can’t fit in their seat with leg room. Due to this I wouldn’t go again as it was really comfortable as I had to hold myself upright during the show. 

There is no on-site car park but they state there are two spaces in the small road behind them (not their spaces). We tried this but unfortunately the spaces are out of use until late May 2022 due to building work. We ended up parking off Carnaby Street. "
5833,"We didn't visit the castle itself but headed for the tea rooms. We've been there before when my wife was more mobile and enjoyed tea or coffee and cakes there. Currently the tea rooms are being redeveloped and so the choice is more limited but still good, though everything is outside. 
However, all paths to both the castle and tearoom so are made of loose gravel. This is ok for mobility scooters with large wide wheels, but horrendous if you're pushing a manual wheelchair. The small front wheels keep getting stuck against the larger pieces of gravel. We got round it by taking to the grass wherever possible and otherwise dragging the wheelchair backwards."
5834,"Cambridge Arts Theatre is located on Peas Hill, in the centre of Cambridge. Access is, on the whole, very good, and the theatre is accommodating towards people with various disabilities."
5835,Always lot's of staff around which I'm sure are friendly.
5836,The Cafe was open to the street.  Getting a wheelchair to table was no problem and rthe staff helped move the seat from the space I required
5837,"When the hall was at its peak, the grounds were well maintained, with a staff of around 28. Trees had been planted opposite the main entrance to protect the north side from the winds. The terraces and gardens on the south side were also we’ll looked after, and hidden amounts the trees were two large ponds, and further into the woods were the greenhouses, and here they grew fruit, veg and herbs for kitchen use, and even a palm house could be found.

When Stephen Joyner MBE, the well known millionaire bought the house, with some saying, the hotel had gone downhill and become rather dilapidated, a pale shadow of itself, gardens had become overgrown and unloved. He purchased the Hall in 1989, and invested £8 million pounds, adding a further 70 bedrooms, and within two years they opened a Spa hotel in 1991, that can rival any today, and we offer you our review of the Spa and parts of the grounds in our PART THREE REVIEW, showing how the Spa has been transformed. The old servants quarters were then turned into the leasure facilities, now holding on proudly to its grade 11 listing.
He then helped to form “Barons Eden” along with 4 other partners, and recently invested £14 million pounds to renovate the Spa and hotel, to create a hotel we can all be proud to visit.

OUR REVIEW
It is a beautiful Spa, all the facilities you need, well maintained equipment, very popular, dressing gowns wandering around quite freely to enjoy what ever their choice has been that day. 
What we did find ourselves that there are many corridors and passages that lead from one area to another (photo 1) it’s not all in one place, but everywhere is so clean and tidy (photo 2) and you have many a choice of how to sit and relax (photo 3).
The pool is indeed pleasant, very popular, we had to wait some time to be able to take photos with no one in the shot (photos 4 to 6) and all guests are given fluffy white robes to wear so as to enjoy a relaxing atmosphere throughout (photo 7).

A delightful passage (8) took us into the fitness studio (9) with all modern  training and keep fit equipment (photos 10 and 11) and again, plenty of seating available (12).
The retreat offered barbers and ladies facial treatments, beauty parlour and special 
occasions hair treatment (photos 13 and 14).
If you fancied fresh air, then walks can be taken around the various gardens, such as our walk around the terraces gardens, but you need to get out of the hotel itself via a lift, then out and along the ramps provided (photo 15) and up into the terrace area (16) then just stroll around the huge area provided (17) to help you, there are resting places (18).0
but soon though you will have to consider going home after a truly delightful visit to Hoar Cross Hall and ramps will take you down to you car (19) before you leave along well maintained driveways (20).

OUR FINAL THOUGHTS ABOUT THE SPA AND TERRACE GARDENS
What’s not to like, each bit you look at is just so nice and delightful. Not just plastic chairs to sit at, one of the nicest Spas we have seen and if you enjoy your spas then this is for you. 
We recommend this Spa."
5838,Flat entrance then everything on one level.
5839,"Fantastic, looked after me at every stage, kept me safe, made it as easy as possible, and recognised my limitations.  Left feeling supported without being a bother or different."
5840,Very attentive and friendly without being overpowering. True Irish charm and humour all added to the positive experience.
5841,A bit 'rustic' but perfectly serviceable.
5842,Excellent
5843,Wheelchair access excellent - all on the level with wide access doors and well spaced seating in the cafe. Good space to navigate the farm shop. No high shelves and staff happy to assist both in the shop and cafe. N.B Outdoor play areas not included in this review and the outdoor areas are hilly. There are picnic tables and a viewing area which would be suitable for wheelchair users or people using other mobility aids but we didn’t’ use them on this visit. 
5844,"The bathroom was pretty tight, but worked for my manual chair. I showered using a plastic pool chair that I was able to transfer into."
5845,"I would recommend using the Bus system, take a bus up Madison Ave and get off at 86th street and walk westwards towards the park. Entrance is to the left of the main steps."
5846,"The park itself was fully wheelchair accessible apart from the shop, which had a step up to it and could have been easily ramped. The paths were made of gravel and were quite steep and challenging in many places, so if you go with a wheelchair I strongly suggest taking some kind of powered assistance or someone who can help you. There was also a golf buggy type vehicle where you could pay to have a guided tour, although we didn't use it.

One nice feature was that the fences had larger holes in places to fit a camera lens through so you could more easily take photos. These with at both standing and sitting height.

There were benches situated at various points round the paths."
5847,"Easy to drive there and lots of free parking. It is level from the car park, into the hotel. Not sure about public transport "
5848,"Part of the Britannia chain of hotels. I booked a accessible twin room via Laterooms.com at a cost of £42.00 on a room only basis Our stay was Interesting to say the least! There was no one manning the reception on arrival, eventually a member of staff came out and checked us in. Having been given an access card for Room 215 I entered the lift and selected the 2nd floor button, the doors closed and then after 30 secs re-opened again! I worked out you had to put the access card in a slot for the lift to operate (we were not told this by the receptionist) The room itself was quite small to move around and was very dated 80's/90's decor and the beds were creaky! We had a sea view but it was very difficult to see through the dirty window, on the plus side the bedroom door was automatic on exit. The wet room was very compact the toilet was too close to the sink and the devonshire rail wouldn't stay upright, there was a shower stool (not attached to the wall). We decided to check out the bar and there was no staff on hand eventually someone appeared from the restaurant, we enquired about food to be told there was no bar snacks only a set meal for £21.95 which turned out to be a help yourself unlimited 3 course buffet and was quite nice.  The hotel needs to up its standards to get a higher rating!"
5849,"There was lift access to the platform we needed (platform 2 from platform 3A) and a shelter. There was also a help point to ask for assistance. 

The indoor waiting room was on the opposite platform near platform 1.

There was a ramp on this platform too."
5850,Fantastic from start to finish. Second time in the building and not had a single access issue.
5851,"Very spacious, well equipped and very clean!"
5852,lots of parking but its busy so you have to get there early. Regular buses into St Andrews every 15 minutes. bus shelter are big enough to accommodate a few people
5853,"Can't comment on then public's transport but the hotel us s 2 different postcodes which may be confusing for sat nav. 
The main carpark has enough dosabled spaces for the hotel but for people with walking issues they may still be too far away. 
The rear carpark which has the other postcode has one disabled space right next to the door by dpes have a kerb all round it so is not the easiest and wide cars may struggle."
5854,Fantastically friendly staff who are able to recommend dishes and offer advice on allergens. 
5855,Very polite 
5856,"The loo is in the large wet room, with plenty of grab rails in a contrasting colour for those who might need that. There was plenty of room for a carer/ wheelchair and a shower chair is available although there is a fold down shower seat. The sink ( like the dressing table in the bedroom and the sink/worktop in the kitchen) is adjustable. The place was spotless with plenty of towels, loo paper and soap. The toilet even washed and dried you!! "
5857,Lots of disabled parking spaces. Visited at least 30 times - only once had to park in 'regular' parking space.
5858,Located in Spondon.
5859,The staff were nice when waiting tables however they looked away embarrassed when they say me struggling to move chairs and then noone was to be found when I was trying to ask for help. 
5860,"As we are both disabled with Sensory & Physical Disabilities, plus chronic health conditions too, also both use wheelchairs too,  but one of us had to leave their wheelchair at home, because there nowhere for two disabled people to seat together in their wheelchairs.

Then we find the rear theatre wheelchair entrance, with one door of the double doorway locked, so we could not get in, with no member of staff manning this door way either, another member of the public had to help us, or we would not of got in.

 This was after being dumped by a non-disabled accessible taxi, at the Theatres front, as it seems no disabled accessible wheelchair taxis are available in Blackpool most of the time it seems, as the council has registered more non-accessible taxis and private hire vehicles than disabled accessible wheelchair taxis.

Then we had no way of knowing where to go, there is no outside signage for the wheelchair entrance at the back of the theatre up an alleyway. I had to force may way into the theatre front doors on crutches, to find a member of staff inside the theatre, where wheelchair users go, I was shouted out by other members of the general public ""Able Bodied"", thinking I was trying to push in front, I said I was only trying to find where wheelchair entrance is.

By the way the rear wheelchair entrance goes through the lower theatre bar, which was full of more members of the public drinking, also would not willingly get out of he way of two disabled people trying to get to the theatre, even when asked.

When at last we got through to the lower theatre seating area, a member of staff asked for tickets, but was too stupid to realise she was dealing with two disabled people with Sensory Disabilities, let alone were Physically disabled too.

Even when my disabled partner told her he was Sensory Impaired as well as a wheelchair user too, she just said your seats and wheelchair space is on the other side of the theatre seating, we had to ask for assistance for the second time, then this female staff or volunteer, only help to push my disabled partner a little way before leaving us to find our seat and wheelchair space in a darken theatre seating area, great help not!

Then when we did get to where we had a seat and wheelchair space, we were having to move to let others into the row of seats we were on, mostly able bodied people, getting disabled people to move for them all the time.

Then we realised how many wheelchair users were in the theatre, we would say more than should be allowed in,

Especially in case of emergency or evacuation was necessary, wheelchair uses, let alone the high number of elderly and disabled people with mobility issues, walking sticks and crutches users or walking frames etc.

Or other Sensory Impaired Disabled People in the audience, could have real problems, as too few staff and volunteers seems to be on duty?

No audio description was available for the performance, or infrared headphones for hearing impaired and hearing aids wearers too.

When the break in the performance half way through, there wattle or no chance of getting to the disabled toilet idf you wanted to in a wheelchair, too many members of the audience lining up for toilet, or getting to the bars, or ice cream sellers etc.

As for any member of staff or volunteers, checking on any of the wheelchair users, would like a drink or anything, no one came and ask any of the eight wheelchair users or us.

Even Joe Brown, made a joke, about some audience could not see him or his band members, this kind of issues, is just some of them.

No tactile warning surfaces, indicators and/or signage, provided for visually impaired and blind disabled people, the likes of fire exists or where any safe havens are located, or where the outside assembly points are for the audience to evacuate too?

They theatre claims to be disabled accessible and staff given disability awareness training too, but the likes of hearing induction loops seem missing from all public areas too.

Equally no Accessible information, is provided in any Disabled Alternative & Accessible Formats, for any official paper work it seems also the theatre own website, does not comply in anyway with Disability & Equality Laws over Accessible Website.

Also the theatre, does not seem to have, a Type-Talk or Text-Phone number, or uses a Text-Relay service, we could find for hearing and speech/language impaired or deaf & dumb disabled people either, 

The problem is, people claim their venues are accessible, but don't know what they are really talking about.

We are making our concerns known to Blackpool Council and the Arts Council, who both fund this theatre, we are suggesting a fully Disability Equality Impact Assessment (D-EIA) Review Report be carried out of the Grand Theatre now too."
5861,"Entrance ramp very steep and awkward angle at top. Out of hours entrance has steps. Once in building public areas are spacious. Bathroom not accessable for wheelchair and beds are low, as is the toilet, and high step into shower cubical."
5862,Very accomodating - Excellent
5863,Friendly and helpful.  Helped us to go through self-service checkout.  Uniforms easy to spot.
5864,"There are many designated disabled bays are available, within the main Liverpool one (Q park) car park. There are 81 available spaces spread across all floors of the carpark. On the third floor where shopmoblity is located there are many bays located near the service.  Shopmobility are Liverpool one’s accessibility partners. The service involves the loaning of mobility equipment such as manual and electric wheelchairs and mobility scooters to visitors.
"
5865,"I travelled on public transport. The nearest tube is Great Portland Street which is not an accessible station, as it has only stairs between platform and street level. Nearest step free tubes are King's Cross and Paddington, from which you can get a bus. From the bus stop it's about a 5 minute walk.  The website says there's free, pre-bookable car parking for visitors with a disability. "
5866,I visited The Chanter this week for afternoon drinks. I have been before when it was busier but really enjoyed the more chill atmosphere.
5867,A great sight but wheel chair access can be tight especially with covid restrictions. Avoid the route around the lake unless you have suitable wheelchair for terrain. The mansion was easily navigates and most of the huts were not to bad to access. The is carpark has disabled parking on a gravel area which can be difficult to get off and on to the tarmac areas. Ramps in areas to the entrance can be steep for some people. Scooters maybe a better way to get around but they have none that you can use
5868,"This site was wheelchair accessible although there would be some issues if you were self-propelling, mainly a long uphill ramp to take you to a better viewing platform. I would advise going when it was less likely to be busy e.g. weekdays in term time, because the pathways weren't that wide and it would be difficult to negotiate through/get to see anything. There is a programme of feeding times which attracted everyone at once; perhaps that's the time to go and see something else there?

If you are susceptible to the heat, as I am, you need to be aware that the crocodiles are kept in a tropical heat atmosphere.  There are some animals (meercats and otters) outside so you can grab a bit of fresh air."
5869,The toilet was easy to find with signposts. There was enough space for my wheelchair but it was quite limited and there was not that much space for my carer although we managed. There were grab rails and it was clean and tidy. The light was a bit dim and there was no Changing Places toilet but there was a baby changing table.
5870,They were very nice 
5871,"There is no parking, other than on street, associated with this building. But there are good bus services to the library and a bus stop fairly nearby."
5872,Easy access
5873,"The venue is on the outside of Newcastle located in Ponteland. The best means of transport to visit Dobbies is by car. They have a large level car park on the premises. There is not a bus stop within 150m of the venue. The nearest public transport would be taking the metro to Newcastle airport. Access by wheelchair however by path to this venue from the airport could be precarious, as at one part you will need to pass a busy road with no traffic lights."
5874,"I didn't need much from them apart from putting ramps in place, but they were competent and polite."
5875,"There is a car park for all visitors who stay in this hotel. There is a bus stop in front of this hotel and also, the Tainan train station just next to this hotel."
5876,The chef was very helpful adapting to anyone's needs. Our instructor Oli was very knowledgable about all the types of equipment available and made sure that everyone was happy and comfortable throughout.
5877,"Enough bays for general parking, disabled bays may be for those using disabled chalets, but all reasonable close to hotel entrance."
5878,The steward on the door was very clueless and needed help directing my mate and I into the stadium but eventually someone helped him out and I thought I wasn't going to get my ticket back to add to my collection (don't worry - I did in the end!). Nothing particularly to point out about the people working there on the day.
5879,adequate
5880,As the hotel and restaurant have a number of disabled regulars the staff are very helpful. Pureed food is provided on request as are any other requests made to them. 
5881,"Very helpful, nothing too much trouble. Very professional ."
5882,I found the gentleman who showed me to the tv room was extremely helpful and kept checking in me throughout the Dvd show. I was able to get a hot drink next to the tv room and my family joined me just after the show finished. But the ticket office staff rattled off the information so fast no one could understand what she said. 
5883,"Lots of parking, easy to get to restaurant, and first impressions were not to bad."
5884,"Superb toilet and shower facilities are provided in a full wet room accessed via a wide door from the bedroom. Drop down handrails are provided either side of the toilet with ample space for turning my wheelchair and transferring to the toilet, and also to the shower chair which was kindly provided."
5885,There is an accessible toilet at Canonmills and is accessed using a RADAR key.
5886,Decent bus services on Easter Rd
5887,It was just unreal to see Concorde. I had never seen it before - to actually see it face to face was amazing. It was just huge. It would have been nice to be able to go inside but I couldn't with the wheelchair. 
5888,"Very helpful, attentive without being overbearing. "
5889,"Volunteers were very friendly, helpful and informative"
5890,We took a taxi to just before the entrance. There was a big car park with several disabled car parking spaces.
5891,"Harlow Carr Gardens in Harrogate, is a tranquil experience, full of natural beauty. The gardens are set in 58 acres of amazing landscaped gardens. The visit to these wonderful gardens is enriching and relaxing and a highly recommended day out.  The specially designed suitable paths provided are ideal for wheelchair accessibility, and push chairs. There is free car parking available all year round, with excellent accessible parking close to the front entrance for disabled visitors, and parent parking bays.  There is a gentle sloped access ramp from the road crossing down to the main entrance of Harlow Carr Gardens. The entrance to the gardens is via the admissions area though automatic doors. There are toilets within the main building and other several other toilets in the gardens including accessible toilets that will accommodate wheelchair users.   There is plenty of seating available in and around the gardens at various heights and all have arm rests. This gives visitors the chance to rest whilst enjoying the gardens. The seasonal blooms offer a fragrant scent as you explore. Harlow Carr has wheelchairs and mobility scooters available to hire from the main entrance, booking ahead is always advisable, however visitors can also bring their own. Registered assistance dogs are also permitted in the grounds, shop and the famous Betty's tearoom. Portable induction loops are also available for visitors on request.  Not all the garden is accessible for wheelchairs, however there is a suggested route for mobility scooters/and wheelchairs to follow.  there are exhibitions in the Old Bath House throughout the year. there is also the Bramall learning centre, this has a fully accessible lift, library and toilets.  The staff are friendly and extremely helpful and they help to ensure you have a great day out. Enjoy a cup of Betty’s Yorkshire tea in this magical setting!"
5892,Very small shop but good enough access.
5893,"The road parallel to the restaurant is a main road which has trams running along. I didn't use the tram while I was there so unable to comment, apart from I noticed that the new trams had wheelchair signs by one of the doors."
5894,"Nice big car park nearby but the rest needs to be done on foot.  Our group got Social Work transport to the said car park but it may be worth driving and then walking, although nearby Currie is on a good bus route."
5895,"It's a lovely place and they really know their allergens in the food (some places just look at your blank when you declare an allergy, NOT THESE GUYS!). Disabled toilet is quite nice, staff are friendly, lighting is usually quite low but it can get very noisy if you go in the evening."
5896,"Good parking which is free for everyone.  Can get a bit busy at times though so it's not always possible to get a disabled parking space near to the shop's. Big spaces in the shopping centre for driving around in powered wheelchair.
Lifts to all floors and plenty of places to eat.  Can be difficult to find your way around as it is so big.
Good accessible changing facilities but you do need a radar key."
5897,There is an accessible toilet close to the entrance before entering the area with the animals. The toilet has a sliding door and although it's not a very large toilet there was still space for my wheelchair and carer. 
5898,"not friendly or helpful, in fact they were quite disparaging"
5899,"The carpark is spacious, but there are no concessions for Blue Badge holders, and the venue is too far away from the roads for yellow line parking to be possible."
5900,"The staff at Yates spoke directly to each of our group members without looking at the carers for assistance. Each individual was understood and asked the appropriate questions you would expect e.g. ice in a drink, which demonstrated fair treatment to all. 
However, the staff did not check back on the enjoyment or quality of our food during or after the meal even though I overheard some other tables being asked this. 
"
5901,"A lovely restaurant with good access! It had a good atmosphere, the food was outstanding and the staff were very nice. All in all we will definitely be back."
5902,The Venue is a long way out in the countryside and and we were glad we had used the toilet before we arrived. The car park and access to the boat were perfectly ok for a wheelchair
5903,the manager and the staff are good at helping with any issue
5904,Flat venue throughout.
5905,"Both platforms give level access on there own platform two you can enter or exit via a gate in the car park strait on to the platform while platform 1 can be accessed via the station building both platforms had a few seats available to use and both platforms were of a good width as well.
our visit was during the day so unable to comment on lighting levels at night time etc. "
5906,"There is a disabled toilet within Jolly’s that is accessed by a RADAR key however, I did not see it when I was there. They do not have a changing place toilet though, there is one down at the beach in Broughty Ferry there is a changing place although. It is only open till 5pm in the Summer and 3:30pm in the Winter."
5907,"Canal towpath accessible at many points from Tiverton onwards towards Taunton, now designated a country park by Devon County Council. Wide and very good surface. About 11 miles in total with excellent cafe at the Tiverton end."
5908,"Although I cant comment on the public toilet the bathroom in the accessible room I stayed in was very easy! With level access shower, grab rails, shower seat and a big room the bathroom wasn’t just accessible it was a bit of luxury. 

This is rare for any hotel accessible bathroom."
5909,"No disabled parking spaces, no lined spaces at all, very uneven ground"
5910,It's flat into and they have a greeter who held the door open for us. If you are a wheelchair user this is a great restaurant choice.
5911,There are multiple accessible toilets on the ground floor. 
5912,"The loo is accessed via a fire door which presented the same challenges as the entrance/exit doors. There was no assistance button at this door. This could be potentially dangerous if there was an emergency especially if you were in the toilet side of the door. 
There was lots of room in the corridor leading to the toilet and the toilet itself was clean, spacious and well laid out with grab rails and a red cord but the sliding door could present similar problems to the entrance/exit/fire doors."
5913,"I believe there are accessible toilets on every floor. They each had a different look and the one on the second floor had a sliding door. On the ground floor there is a Changing Places toilet that can be accessed with a RADAR key. The accessible toilets I look at looked like there was enough space to manoeuvre and had the appropriate grab rails and red emergency cords (with Euan's Guide's Red Cord Cards attached). The flush on each was located on the wall behind the toilet, which might not be the best location for everyone. It was great to see that two of the three accessible toilets I looked in also had a shelf next to the toilet. "
5914,"The disabled toilet lies along a level corridor, but it’s a bit tight in there, you may just about spin your chair and carer would struggle to help you in there. But it does have grab rails and pull cord."
5915,Crathes is on the main Royal Deeside road from Aberdeen. We arrived by car and after approaching along the tree lined drive we swept in to a large car park. Looking for accessible parking bays for our WAV (wheelchair accessible vehicle) we spotted the sign for disabled parking. We drove past the Castle and on around to the dedicated parking at the back of the gift shop. 
5916,"This is a Glastonbury gift shop selling all kinds magical and spiritual gifts such as crystals, incense, figurines, jewellery, skincare, soaps, and much more than I could list here!"
5917,The ramps are all at a low gradient with flat platforms. The only minor difficulty we had was at the back of the museum shed where there are rails however with a little effort I got the wheelchair over. Going up to an exhibition room was very easy with a lovely long ramp that turns back in the other direction. There is plenty of room to turn the corner. They can put a ramp out to get on the train in the guards van. If you are able to walk 10m down the corridor there is a seating area reserved for disabled visitors on busy days. 
5918,Very happy with Smiths staff member for going over the bridge to get the chair (and for not just sending my husband to get it himself).
5919,"Yes the facilities are fully accessible.  Each bungalow is slightly different, so it might we worth talking to the owners. "
5920,Helpful in an appropriate and unobtrusive way.
5921,"There is one accessible toilet located next to the rest of the customer toilets in the store these are behind the checkouts. 
There is a good amount of room in this toilet with the sink and hand dryers at a level to suit people in wheelchairs."
5922,"I've been going here for years as one of my favourite restaurants is here, when I was more able bodied it wasn’t a problem but I'm more disabled now and can't used escalators or stairs anymore.

The best thing is the disabled parking which is free if you register your blue badge and car at the information desk. It's also on the upper level of the shopping centre so you don't have to worry about lifts. 

The restaurants as family accessible there's a slight slight doe to them and a lift at the other end if you want to go to those on the lower level.

However, going to the shops on the lower level of shops is difficult if you have mobility issues and can’t handle escalators and steps. After the escalators there are four or five steps which kind of makes things difficult if you can handle escalators but not stairs. I can’t even use escalators now. There are two lifts to the lower ground floor but they are a long walk from the other lifts that are in the same corridor as the entrance to the car park.

The place is huge and although there is a one way system for COVID-19 it's too far for me to walk what they expect. There is so much space you don’t really need a one-way system to help with social distancing.

I do what I can, I’m wearing a mask and using two crutches. They have marshals at times and they take one look at me and don’t try to get me to use the one way system as it blatantly is too difficult. "
5923,Lots of parking. Very close to Halifax train station. Not sure about bus transport.
5924,"excellent, great disability awareness, even brought up breakfast in bed - as long as you give them notice about your needs, you'll be fine"
5925,"Tickets for the golf course can be bought at the food van next to the entrance of the golf course. The counter is at standing height. I was give a club, ball, score card and pencil. This is a mini golf course so there are short distances between the different holes. The golf course has level access but some of the holes have a slope of other obsticles to make the course more harder to navigate. The member of staff told me to leave the flag in the hole when I am playing the shot, as at the end when the ball goes in the hole I can pull the flag and it will also lift the ball, and this saved me bending down to take the ball out of the hole. When I visited there 1 of the 12 holes was missing its flag, but I asked someone else to take the ball out of the hole for me. There was a bench about half way round. It is a relatively easy course to navigate and was very doable with my crutch."
5926,"There is free on-site parking available, however, the ground in the surrounding streets is quite old , cobbly, and full of potholes as they are doing up the whole area (Bacalan) which used to be  docks.  It's a bit of a wheel from the tram stop B over this ground and it takes quite a while to negotiate as you have to go slowly over the cobbles to avoid bone-shaking.  There is another tram stop which might be nearer and a bus too. It's not too well signposted  until you're very close, we encountered a few wandering tourists on the way!"
5927,"If you need a wheelchair accessible vehicle, speak to the concierge as one of the taxi firms specialises in this."
5928,No parking outside venue - only a drop off point.  Public transport is available but a walk will be incurred.
5929,"Easy access, smooth floors, wide aisles"
5930,Not interested.
5931,I was driven there but the nearest bus stop is a few hundred yards way
5932,"The port staff are generally sullen and if there is mis-communication between the booking clerk and the lane staff at embarkation, then it is considered to be the customers fault (I have been told 'well I'll believe you THIS time' and 'You must have got it wrong' on 2 occasions when my request for a wheelchair space has not been relayed to the embarkation crew.) This is on both sides of the Solent but more likely to happen at the Portsmouth terminal.
On board staff are generally good and are helpful if asked to assist."
5933,is good for power chair  and  perfect Lift for wheelchair 
5934,"There is a large carpark.  However it is a funny shape, no marked out bays, if they are busy you could get a little stuck.  I definitely recommend reversing into a space if you can."
5935,Z Arts is on a bus route. Its on a busy main road. There are disabled parking bays at the front of the building.
5936,"The single door into this eatery is heavy to open, but the entrance is perfectly smooth, level, and wide enough for easy wheelchair access. The floorboards are also smooth, and the tables are spaced apart in such a way that moving between them is very easy. There are a variety of seating options at different heights and types of chairs available. A gender neutral disabled toilet is available by the till, and appears to be the only public toilet available in the unit. Unfortunately, full changing facilities are not available.
 The counter for Bar Burrito is a good height, making communicating your order with the staff very easy, and accessing the card reader to pay is also easy. The staff are incredibly friendly and are always willing to speak to me personally, instead of via a carer.
 Although the standard Bar Burrito policy is to clear away your own rubbish, returning the tray to a stack in the corner, staff often clear my rubbish for me so I don’t have to. Even if they are busy and I end up clearing my own rubbish, it is easily accessible and at an excellent height for me to use.
 The eatery is near the train station, bus stop, and car park, and is on a popular router for taxis. The pavement is mostly level, with the odd wobbly paving stone causing minor bumps.
"
5937,"The entrance is step free and there is a modern lift to all floors. The lift is surprisingly cramped and there is no room for a wheelchair user to turn around inside it - you may want to roll in backwards to make your exit easier. The lift is also agonisingly slow: if there were prizes for lift slowness, this one would be a winner. The book display tables are arranged very inconsiderately for wheelchair users. They are so close together, and close to shelving, that many sections of the bookshop cannot be reached in a wheelchair - the gaps are too narrow. Because the tables are heavily stacked with books, it's not possible to shove them out of the way."
5938,"No disabled spots, just a pot holed rough loosely compacted ground area, made to look worse by the heavy rain, and very limited food on offer, but in good condition, would buy if needed, but not appealing enough for the journey to get there."
5939,"Access was excellent with a ramp to the front door, power assisted doors, plenty of room and a spacious disabled toilet."
5940,"I'm not sure able public transport however there's a very large car park right outside which wasn't even half full on a Saturday afternoon.

Whilst the museum is free, parking isn't and my partner found the machine to pay didn't work very well if you didn't have exact change. Staff at reception were able to help with this and there was an attendant in the far corner of the car park which we only spotted after we'd resolved it! Other than that, getting there was very easy."
5941,"I like going to Starbucks because I know what I can eat/drink with my allergies and the interior is almost always the same, so helps me keep calm when going to a new city (as I'm Autistic). This one has really annoyed me because they had a refit recently. What they did was the put a number lock on the toilets but did not put one on the disabled loos, or even a RADAR lock. This is because many people will nip in off the square to use their loo. When I go in now and need the toilet I have to wait whilst someone finishes who just couldn't be bothered to go get the number. It's also very difficult to get a drink as quite often they are rushing people along and don't want to give you the time to put money away (hard if you're on crutches) and blame you if they get your order wrong because ""you didn't speak loud enough"" and a variety of other excuses."
5942,"A modern building, so access should be good, and it is.  Staff meet you at the door and ask if you want to stay in your wheelchair or transfer.  They have movable bench seats and quickly find a table that is convenient and comfortable."
5943,Parked right outside. You could get a train there from Sheffield station and get off at the restaurant as well!
5944,There was some parking immediately in front of the pub.
5945,"I git the train through from Glasgow, and despite major works going on in and around the station, the journey was perfect. 

The station is directly across the street from the entrance of discovery point."
5946,"The restaurant staff are very polite, helpful and friendly. There are dairy and gluten free options that staff are generally knowledgeable about. "
5947,"The museum doesn't have its own car park, but there is a place where wheelchair users can be dropped off outside and it didn't prove too tricky to find a blue badge space on a street nearby. "
5948,Excellent facility
5949,"Once inside I had a great experience but had a little difficulty initially with the double doors, needed assistance and could do with a bell.  Staff very friendly and helpful."
5950,Disabled parking bays near the main entrance.
5951,Difficult to get dropped off near this place but there is  a dropped curb directly opposite the entrance.
5952,Friendly and helpful.
5953,The staff are friendly.
5954,"I love this place in my town, but I can only do the castle on a good day, because it isn't accessible. The beautiful gardens are all the year round wheelchair accessible. So is the shop ant the cafe."
5955,Toilets have changing table and lots of handrails etc. The area is quite restrictive space-wise as a result of the amount of adaptations included.
5956,Parking outside on the street but no disabled parking at the actual venue that I was aware of but there is a lowered kerb and it was easy to park.  There is also a car park nearby.
5957,"Lots of stairs, ground floor is split level and rails are tightly packed together, 1st floor is up a large flight of stairs, no lift access. Parking is excellent, own car park at the rear (no disabled spaces though) in street parking to the front.
The store is not the one it’s the picture, that’s in Fraserburgh "
5958,"Sliding doors, plenty room, light and airy.  Reception desk,  cafe and toilets."
5959,Taxi rank and James Street railway station and Bus stop 2 mins away. Q Car Park 5 mins walk.
5960,The staff were terrific. Nothing was too much trouble and they were friendly and helpful throughout our stay.
5961,"The staff were bizarre. The person serving coffee did not understand basic English, and was unable to respond clearly. Another member of staff was rather officious about the back area of the café being closed and out of bounds. Further stars lost because of the staff's failure to maintain the red emergency cord in the toilet as required."
5962,"Trinity kitchen can be accessed via a lift and has plenty of space inside to move around, most parts are well lit though there are some darker areas, Each food counter is easy to approach and there is a large ramp to reach the lower level. Tables are spaced out well and are at a lower height to be easy to access. "
5963,Parking and transport is a bit tricky as it is a city centre garden square. You can be dropped near the entrance if required. The Square is very close to the West End of Princes Street where there are loads if transport connections.
5964,"Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest to Boots Opticians is the Council owned parking approximately 200m away on Mizzymead Rd.
The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access."
5965,We are returning guests to bench Cottage and this is our 3rd year. Matt and Helen make you feel very welcome. Our bench has all the handling equipment we need and my son could have a shower this year as we could use a changing bench. The accommodation is warm and cosy. The addition of a coffee machine was a nice touch. We did need to sue Lymington Hospital during our stay..their minor injuries unit was very helpful and efficient and got husband and son sorted quickly. The home made cake we found on arrival was a lovely touch.
5966,"The staff were so lovely and helpful, they were polite and I cannot fault the service"
5967,There is an accessible toilet on the reception floor which we did not use but would expect to match the high standard throughout.
5968,We travelled by train from Sevenoaks to Charing Cross.  I had booked disabled assistance but we were early both going to London and coming back.  We were met both ends by helpful station staff who were waiting with ramps.  There was plenty of space in the designated disabled seating area and the accessible loo was nearby.  
5969,"Whilst marked on the local signs as a wheelchair friendly path, it includes some steep slopes, difficult surfaces on the paths around the cattle grids and some areas (eg from the main path to the cafe) unsurfaced (just gravel paths).
The food in the cafe was good (including several gluten free options) and the staff friendly and helpful.
"
5970,One accessible toilet are on ground floor so the use of the very tiny lift is necessary (if everyone is trying to use this during the interval of shows this can end up with a big backlog).  Toilet cubicle itself is wide but there was no paper when I visited. 
5971,"a large door with level access was fine to roll my powerchair in once my friend held it open. 

There are lots of tables and chairs and first impressions from the outside were that it might be tight. Once inside however there is actually plenty of space between the tables. Might have something to do with cafe being  favourite spot with young parents and children in buggies."
5972,Very good! There was a long permanent ramp to get up to the entrance level. The entrance itself is ramped and was signposted. Inside the cathedral most of it is step free. You can go up and down the aisles easily and wonder at the roof and the windows. The one bit that you can't get to is the altar but you can get close to it and get a good idea of the size and grandeur even if you can't get up close & personal!
5973,"Public transport is limited.

There are three marked bays outside but they're often full. "
5974,"We went there in a private car, there are disabled parking spaces just outside of where the gondolas are "
5975,"A pleasant break taken here to look over hotel, and check out a modern up to date Spa,  while enjoying a drinks break.

This is part one of reviews here, do read part two, the Spa.

The ancient Hatherley Manor,s history began way back in 1022, and a 1086 survey 
tells us that the estate was being held by a Edmar, a Thane, who held it during the reign of Edward the confessor. It is not really known how long the land was under 
control of the Crown, but it is known that in 1311 it was held by Sir John de Bosworth 
but then passed on to Sir John Willoughby de Broke in 1491.
The Manor then passed through several families, before becoming the possession of Sir Matthew Wood, who was twice the Lord Mayor of London.
During the mid 19th century, Anthony Gilbert Jones, a man who was the Mayor of Gloucester on three occasions, possessed the Manor, and his seventh son and youngest, patented the Hatherley Lattisteps, called today, a stepladder.It was also the Jones family company of Jones and co that made plans for the mass production of deckchairs.
During the time of the Jones family in the Manor, and later on, extensive refurbishments changed the estate very much.
Then this old now 17th century house had additions added to it in the late 18th century, and again in 1983 through 86, when it first became a small hotel, but still retained that look of an imposing country court house, and its history can still be seen in the reception area, the restaurant, beams room and Swallows suite.

The hotel stands in a 37 acre parkland, surrounded by mature gardens, with a walled garden and an orchard. 
Today, there is only one bedroom that has special needs facilities, with low level light
Switches, low sinks, high toilet, pull cord, with a low level access bath with shower in it.  The door in the corridor is wide enough to allow a wheelchair to get in, but if this has been taken, then beware that there is no lift in the hotel, so let them know your needs before you book a room.
All areas on the ground floor, lounge, the restaurant, are easily accessible and not far from public toilets. There are 56 en-suite berooms available.

After driving along through flat areas of farmland for crop growing (photo 1) we finally arrived at Hatherley Manor hotel, (photo 2) about as inspiring as the tedious drive just undertaken, just a two storey plain red brick building, nothing to write home about, no gardens in sight, just an open lawn like frontage, very disappointing.
Opposite the single line parking area in front of the hotel, with no disabled bays, we went to enter the very dull plain hotel entrance (photo 2) and entered a very plain unassuming reception area, feeling rather let down at that moment (photo 3).
However, things did perk up a bit as we sat down in the bar lounge for a coffee break (photo 4) before exploring the rest of the hotel. Next to the bar, a warm looking pink red room with nice places to sit (photo 6) was inviting, with a doorway leading off to the restaurant, which was a pleasant, nicely decorated, tastefully done dining area (photo 7) with a small alcove available with four tables and chairs (photo 8) for a more intimate dining experience. 
Back out of restaurant in the pink room, a lovely open fireplace, with neatly stacked log piles looked cosy enough (photo 9) with a homely look.
At the far end of the bar lounge (photo 10) we spotted the entrance to the toilets and a corridor lead to the Spa, Bedrooms and toilets (photo 11) but we found no disabled toilet, just the Lords and Ladies public guest toilets (photo 12) which were clean and tidy, but no pull cord or grab rails, and I had to leave wheelchair out in the corridor to be able to use the facilities.
Coming out of the toilet (photo 13) the corridor continues ahead ( photo 14) and lead to the Hatherley function suite (photo 15) but that was not at all inspiring, so we returned to the bar and enjoyed a glass of wine. (photo 16).

Our final thoughts.
Interesting, but uninspiring, nothing to look at, but at least it was to a certain extend, wheelchair friendly, but we will not be returning. 

Let’s hope now, that after all the hype it’s been given that our next review for the hotels Spa will be more interestng. Please read the review to see what we felt.
"
5976,"My Experince for the 2nd time was dreadful. We once again went here this time with a service dog as we entered we were told no dogs allowed having explained she was a service dog I was asked if I was blind bearing in mind she is not my dog I said no I can see just fine thank you.  It was then thinks got bad I was asked to explain what a service dog is for I said she is a service dog to assist the person needing her but your not blind I said none of us are blind thank you. Well what is the dog for I once again said to Assist someone in need. For health and safety I cannot allow you to bring the dog inside it can wait outside.
I felt at this point there was no use in keeping trying to explain. The dog was to help anxiety and this conversation was not helping at all. I left again.

No understanding of disability is known or understood at this venue."
5977,"Downstairs, accessible from the town square are two accessible bedrooms, with a large en suite bathroom each. Because I am unable to go upstairs,  breakfast was served to me in my room by both of the owners."
5978,They seemed fine
5979,Just superb. The owners went out of their way  to help and advise.
5980,"The access into the restaurant was a dream with large doors and just one right angle corner to navigate and one tiny 2 inch wide ramp from the street. All of this was much larger than your usual doorway so turning was not a problem. Food was fantastic, service great they allowed extra time for our orders and were more than happy to move tables to provide us with more room. We didn't use the disabled toilet but it was large and clean with really easy access. The only issue we had was getting onto the pavement to get into the restaurant, there isn't a drop curb directly outside so you have to navigate the quite narrow pavement about 4 metres up the road. We did this is my mums much larger than average customed electric wheelchair so it is manageable. This was something I didn't notice when I scoped it out before our visit. Overall I would visit again especially if your a pizza lover like mum and I. "
5981,"Having grown up loving the annual Festival in Edinburgh it's been upsetting to see barriers to access...changing that takes time and a lot of effort. I LOVE how much is being done. I went to the box office to collect my tickets and they told me clearly where the access lift was and where to go. They also told me to look out for staff members on the way in case I had any trouble...that reassured me it was ok to ask which is always a worry. Teviot is a large University building with lots of space for various performers.  At the entrance there is a huge sign stating where is accessible with wheelchair symbols at the top...all of it can now be accessed. The access lift on outside of building is a short journey and a member of staff made sure we (my daughter and I) were ok. We then went inside and again it was clear where we were to be. We were incredibly early and there's not masses of space for waiting, the corridors are used for those exiting the previous performance and I hate feeling I'm in the way, through a door to one side it was possible to wait until the event before us had been cleared without feeling awkward...phew. The staff manager came through on her way to another location and asked if myself and a mum with a child in a wheelchair were being looked after, I love when people pay attention to that, it shows they want it all to work. Once we could go into the event the performer actually greeted us as we went in, which is quite unusual in my festival experience and again we sat in the space for chair users. Some of these spaces which are not purpose built are quite small and we had to move to let people slide into the row, there was space to do so but it's worth noting. The performance was larger than 'intimate gigs' probably are, there were 36 others with us, but small enough everyone could see the 'stage' and hear what was happening. We saw Eshaan Akbar:Not for Prophet and he was hilarious. I'm often offended by comedians who poke fun at others from disability to religion and although he did pick on religion is was in terms of what HE'S been through rather than moking someone else. I could relate to what he was talking and joking about and when he mentioned impairments I thought I was going to be upset, only to discover he is deaf in his left ear and uses a hearing aid.
He covered topics like immigration, parental relationships, growing up, work, and spoke candidly about the importance of finding ones identity in 2017 when the world appears to be losing it's own. I left still smiling and have already spoken to friends to say not only are the venue and staff great at what they do but that things are improving and that the attitude and atmosphere is changing too. It's taken a long time, but it's gathering pace which is exciting to see. I'd have no worries about returning to Teviot for an event and I'm delighted to see that not all comedians take joy in belittling others, a breath of fresh air on all counts I think! "
5982,"We drove there. Don't know about public transport. As you drive down towards the beach, you reach a small roundabout with blue badge parking on your right. I suggest you ignore that and carry on down the hill (2nd exit) to a level car park, much easier. "
5983,The restaurant has a reasonable sized car park. There are no designated disabled parking bays.
5984,"When arriving at the visitor centre I found lot's of accessible parking close to the centre.
The trail is a circular route leaving front the main building.
It goes through the woods past a nice bird watching area and an area for star gazing as it is within the dark sky zone. "
5985,"We visited at Halloween weekend, so it was amazing to see all the autumn colours at this time of year. This is a really old ruin, so much of the site is quite inaccessible - but you can really get a feel for the castle and what it once was by wandering around the grounds. It's a really atmospheric site."
5986,Narrow corridor but no steps.
5987,Visited the cathedral where they have clearly tried to make the place accessible to all 
5988,On the whole we found the Gardens accessible.  The map showing routs for wheelchairs and buggies was really useful.  Gradients at some point was a bit of a push but there were a number of benches for the pusher to have a rest.
5989,Very helpful
5990,Very helpful and understanding. 
5991,Excellent
5992,Taxi rank outside the hotel. Good pavement ramps even though a bit steep. That can't easily be helped but access into the hotel is excellent. This hotel is on the Royal Miles close to North Bridge - loads of buses.
5993,"Good sized toilet with a changing table. Was nice to see a Red Cord Card attached to the emergency cord. Note that there are steps to the toilets if you are coming from the main entrance of cafe. There is a platform lift beside the steps, but if you'd prefer not to use this there is also a level entrance doorway to the toilets from the coach parking spaces outside. This depends on where you choose to park/drop off of course. My only criticism is the placement of large bins beside the toilet space. "
5994,Just say you know the team at Tobii and you'll get a warm welcome at reception :)
5995,"Majority of staff are friendly, although, there is the odd one that will try and place people in a wheelchair out of view and has a condescending look on her face to people with walking aids."
5996,Very friendly and helpful
5997,"On my return visit in October 2018 I was pleased to find that an accessible toilet has been recently installed in the basement, which is accessible by lift or stairs. The toilet is spacious, with grab rails and emergency cord. Previously staff have had to escort me to another part of the building to use the facilities. Really helpful improvement."
5998,"Large car park right next to it, with accessible bays.

We used the postcode for the New Boston Hotel opposite and found it easily.  "
5999,"There were disabled loos at various places across the site. The one I used inside the restaurant was clean, well equipped and spacious: that one was radar key operated (though the staff unlocked it on request)."
6000,A Museum that looks at the Industrial life of Scotland there are a wide range of exhibits on show these are spread out over a large area. The Main Exhibition hall is all undercover and has a range of displays. There is a wheelchair lift to the upper level this area is used for special exhibitions and displays. There also displays like a Sawmill cottages that cover different periods of time that let you see the way people lived.
6001,I've always had a nice experience here. Staff seem very knowledgable on the menu. 
6002,Staff were very friendly and happy to support
6003,"We stayed here 2 weeks ago, it was our 7 year old severe complex needs sons first holiday so we were nervous. Everything was perfect inside the house, everything we could have asked for, profile bed, wet room, hoist, lift, all in very good order. The views across the sea... just wow! "
6004,Parking is right outside the centre and just a short walk to the tearoom. We got a space easily enough.
6005,"To get to the disabled toilet, you need to ask the steward who opens the door for you. When you're in the toilet, it is very spacious and I could easily turn my mobility scooter! "
6006,We were served by a dark haired lady who was very helpful and friendly. All the staff were very friendly and nothing seemed to 'put them out'.
6007,"Riding on a steam train is a special and unforgettable experience. The train is accessed via a ramp in to the guard's van. There are windows in the gusrds van and a small bench seat so that if your wheelchair is too large to fit through the carriage doorway inbto the disabled space on the carriage, you can travel with two companions in the guard's van. Our wheelchair user in his pwerchair was just able to get through into the carriage. There is a Carer's ticket scheme so that a wheelchair user's companion goes free. The staff are mostly volunteers and we were made to feel very welcome.
I understand that a Lottery grant will enable them not only to carry out repairs to the line, but also some is earmarked for improvements to the accessibility of the railway. Have a look at their website for more information https://www.nymr.co.uk/ or phone them in advance (which is what we did)."
6008,Disabled car parking is directly opposite the hotel. 
6009,Staff are helpful and friendly.
6010,Accessible loos on each floor and good lift in between.
6011,The staff on the flight were very helpful but the our rep was completely unhelpful.
6012,There was a wide entrance with automatic doors. The entrance was spacious and there was a corridor to reach the room. There were also two doors for the emergency exit and the room was brightly lit.
6013,"Ask for Room 4 which has its own secure access.  There is one shallow step but I presume the hotel will provide a ramp (request this when booking).
Meals are taken at the gastropub next door (there is a ramp and a ground floor accessible toilet). Unfortunately there is not a covered walkway for any guest!  But there is tea/coffe making facilities in the room"
6014,"As far as I’m aware there isn’t a disabled toilet at this restaurant. It looked like I couldn’t get the toilets because of a high table so, I got my helper to take photos for me. They are all single cubicles and judging by the photos, plus my helpers opinion, I don’t think a wheelchair user would manage, especially if they need assistance. You can see an image of one of the toilets below.

Of course there isn’t a changing place toilet either, the closest one is in the V&A which is a 5 minute walk away and open till at least 5pm. 10pm if the V&A restaurant is open."
6015,"Absurd to try and park nearby. But the area is rammed with buses all the time, and zillions of trains pass through the station every day."
6016,"Excellent, asked if were wanting anything specific, offer to take us to the lift and the curtain area, offered me the a touch, sensory feel of the fabric and texture - though she who must be obeyed said ‘ that’s what your buying ‘ , so decision made. The staff were fantastic can’t fault them."
6017,The staff in the hotel made us welcome and were friendly the staff in the Brickfield are also very welcoming and in both cases will give you there name etc 
6018,"Full marks for step-free access throughout, including a platform lift, and a spare narrow wheelchair in case your own wheelchair is too big to fit in the lift (my chunk powerchair did fit in fine). The introductory video has an embedded BSL interpreter. Audio guides are available at no charge."
6019,This is an outside concert area shaped like a bowl  for concerts. It is grass but they lay a path down for wheelchair users from the special entrance for them near the stage. There is a raised platform area with a graduated ramp access with chairs for carers. Not too crowded at our gig to see the Foo fighters
6020,Staff were excellent throughout. They were friendly and helpful. Service was attentive but not intrusive. When we were ready to leave we asked the staff and they telephoned for a taxi for us and then kept a look out and informed us when our taxi arrived.
6021,These are some way from the club and need a 4 number code to access which the club will give you
6022,Hard to get their attention sometimes as bar is busy and had to remind one to not pack baby seats around where I was sitting as large powerchairs need more than half a metre space to fit through. Any waiters we had were nice.
6023,"Stables tearoom is accessible with a wheelchair but a mobility scooter would need to be left outside the door.  There is a central courtyard where you can sit at the picnic benches, plenty of room for chairs/scooters.  The Theatre,  Cinema, Bike shop are all accessible and best of you can borrow a mobility scooter and go for a 2 mile ride right round the park."
6024,"All required rails, nice clean toilet but the red cord was like knitting. I brought it to the attention of the manager and left a Euan’s Red Cord Card. "
6025,It's really hard here but the truth is is that you can get in fine and there are good paths to the main barns. But from there it is gravel paths and pushing my son is hard work...if you are self propelling I would not recommend.
6026,"Young, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, friendly, helpful"
6027,"Although I did not visit them on this occasion, there is a  dedicated accessible toilet at the starting point of the Gondola, and another one at the top"
6028,"You have parked near the hotels entrance, but it’s now a bit of a push for your carer as you have to be pushed around to the rear of the hotel to see the gardens, so we have just dropped the stars on our review. 
You can of course get out via the hotels rear exits, (but no place to park a car)  but you will only see around the terrace area going that way."
6029,No wheelchair access. 
6030,"Manual exit gate (also used for entrance). Whole site accessible, but some narrow paths and a very narrow bridge which wheelchair just managed to navigate. No direction signs in the site, sole reliance on navigation was by following the text-based quiz provided."
6031,Parking is right outside door of property. Enough space for two cars.
6032,"Loops throughout,  though I've fed back not all work 100%.
Signage clear and everything viewable
No steps. Ramp to front door and down into one room. 
Subtitles on the film
Seats throughout
States they will arrange BSL interpretation given notice"
6033,"The staff were alright. I mean, they talked to me like a child and asked if I wanted to go to the wheelchair shelter and I said no but he pushed me to the wheelchair shelter. "
6034,An expected and well earnt five stars for Tower Bridge! Arriving at the exhibition entrance we were spotted and the accessible entrance opened. The guy at the ticket desk explained how accessible it was and talked is through the route. Taking the lift we were whisked up into the North tower to watch the historical story unfold. From there it was short distance out on to the East Walkway for fantastic views across both the river and city. Then onward to a lift to go down into the South tower with another gallery area and an accessible loo. We then left the tower and walked to the engine room.
6035,"I was attending the commonwealth games so I would think some of the stewards were ClydeSiders. There was a general feel good atmosphere so whether the stewards are as great normally I can't really say, but everyone was incredibly helpful and pleasant. I was also able to change seats to give me more leg-room."
6036,There are a few disabled parking spaces along the esplanade in disabled bays and where there is on-street pay and display parking bays  where at the time of this review blue badge holders can park for free.  
6037,Excellent. Flat access throughout. All great.
6038,"We visited here for the new year,the lodge is owned by MNDA Scotland and can be booked through them.It is fitted to a very high standard and cannot be faulted in any way,everything you would need for the disabled is included in the price you pay and there is a discount for MND sufferers.It is situated on a quiet caravan park with an excellent restaurant on site."
6039,"My team and I  were looking for accessible accommodation in the Kinross area and I stumbled across this gem of a place. It’s so lovely to stay in the same place as a team and the lodge has everything you could want and need. This really is luxury home from home. We all slept well and all curled well too. We enjoyed staying there so much as a team that we are returning again next month. 
It’s such a great place and Shona is very helpful and able to accommodate most of your requests. 
The stunning views from this wonderful location makes me want to come back when I’m not curling so I can enjoy just relaxing there and chilling out. 
I’m a full time wheelchair user and the Lodge was very easy for me to get around. 
It’s an all round great place to stay. "
6040,"There is a handy bus stop just outside the restaurant which has frequent busses into town. There is on-street parking in the surrounding streets, although watch out for cobblestones! Nearby Newkirkgate shopping centre has a large outdoor car park, under five minutes walk from the restaurant. "
6041,Tricky when busy but ramped access throughout. Clear signage.
6042,The staff we met were very helpful
6043,"Taking the lift to the lower level, think it's called the Garden Level, you come out by the cafe, shop and restaurant. Here you can link to the other Gallery building where a similar lift will take you upstairs.

There are two accessible loos adjacent to the main toilets, just look out for the signs to get you there. Both are of the spacious and of a narrow style but worked for me as a powerchair user."
6044,Flat access to cafe
6045,Very pleasant friendly and helpful particularly the manager.
6046,Very accessible for wheelchairs.
6047,"Fantastic venue with great atmosphere, lovely food and awesome staff."
6048,"West Bank park is a 20-acre park located in Holgate, just outside the city centre. There is a large woodland area where there are  paths to follow through the trees. Next to this is a meadow area with picnic benches. The park has 2 very well maintained bowling greens which are often in use by West Bank Park Bowling Association, there are benches along the periphery to sit and watch. For children and teenagers there are two playgrounds - one for under eleven years, the other for over eleven's. The park also has a basketball court which is accessible when the park is open. There is a pergola walk, with roses and flowers to either side, but this does contain steps. The alternative path is wide and even, it is set on a slope and there are a few benches along the way to stop and rest if needed..
There are toilets in the park and a small car park nearby. The park is set along a main road between York city centre and Acomb, and this has numerous bus services running along it.

"
6049,Staff were helpful
6050,There is no real parking on Bread Street but there is parking on surrounding street. Nearby Lothian road is serviced by many Edinburgh bus routes. 
6051,"Brilliant - spacious, clean and tidy."
6052,"No cafe, and no toilet seen."
6053,"Excellent accessibility, much thought has gone into all aspects of access."
6054,The disabled toilet is through the cafe (via a platfomr lift) and through a theatre entrance door and could be better signposted. Large toilet with grab rails and well looked after.
6055,"I travelled by wheelchair taxi, but plenty of dedicated accessible parking near the main entrance.
There is a regular public bus service to the treatment centre , with a dedicated bus stop within the grounds "
6056,There was a lift specialist for disabled people and a kind security guard helped us use it. It was simple from thier. 
6057,"The museum is on a single level, making access easy. But everything is a little shoe horned in which would make taking a wheelchair around a no go."
6058,"Staff made the visit with table service at meal times, help with refreshments, and nothing was too much trouble.

Breakfast is a self service buffet style and staff were happy to help me with this and carry things to my table."
6059,"There is a spacious,  accessible loo in the Community Centre adjacent to the cafe. Easy to find and well signed"
6060,There are accessible loos.
6061,Very friendly and communicated well.
6062,"Accessible toilet easy to find and signed well, lots of rails to hand. It has baby change too. Red cord was tied up on my first visit the week it opened, I put a red cord card on the cord and it has remained there to this day and the cord has remained freely dropping to the floor since."
6063,Great loo but no hoist and changing table.
6064,"definitely need your own transport as the farm is in a remote area.

details here: https://www.vosefarmcottages.co.uk/"
6065,Downing Street is accessible in so far as it appears but the security doesn't actually allow you to get very close.
6066,The only staff we spoke to were in the suit shop and one shoe shop. They were all lovely... really helpful.
6067,On street parking nearby.
6068,"The disabled toilets are very, very impressive. There is one in the main entrance basement near the right hand side lift, and two on the ground floor of the main gallery in each of the two wings. Each toilet is incredibly spacious with plenty of room for manoeuvring. There are also height adjustable changing tables and a height adjustable sink. The toilets were clean and well maintained."
6069,"Located near Wilko and Intu Derby.
"
6070,The staff could not have been more helpful. Well trained and full of encouragement and willingness to help and make the experience one to remember. 
6071,The hostess Moira is the most amazing lady and is passionate about providing accessible accommodation that provides home from home comfort.
6072,"Students from the Entry to Learning Level 2 course at Edinburgh College visited The Scottish Parliament as part of their Leonard Cheshire Can Do community review project. We had a Q&A session with Ben Macpherson MSP within the Scottish parliament and then had a tour around the building learning all about the architecture and artwork. We then got to observe a debate in the main hall.

Overall we gave this visit 5 out of 5 stars and would highly recommend it!"
6073,"Like a lot of Fringe venues, due to the city centre location parking is difficult. There is on street parking directly outside the venue on Chamber Street although you need to be pretty lucky to get a space close by.
The nearest tram stop (St Andrews Square) is about approx 15-20 min walk away.
There is a good bus service passing close by with the closest stop being a 2 min walk away.
Buses that pass close by that I am aware of include the numbers 31, 35, and X62."
6074,Parking is available by the hotel with some accessible spaces. There is a larger car park across the road specifically for Duck Bay customers. 
6075,Limited spaces
6076,It’s a pretty smooth route except for the aforementioned tree roots. 
6077,Good accessable toilet with plenty of room .
6078,"The museum is just off the c, the main square in Vieux Nice (the Old Town). Buses and trams stop in the vicinity but it will involve a short walk. Approaching from the sea front is a level walk."
6079,"Platform one has good disabled access, there is a ticket office and staff on hand to help if people have questions. When through the barriers there is a ramp to the left and stairs to the right for access on to the platform. Trains to London tend to go from this platform. 

Platform 2 (accessed from Mount Pleasant Road) requires a lift to go down to the platform. If you're on platform one you'll need to exit the station and go along Vale Road to access platform two, the lift is on your right when you go through the station doors. There is a ticket office here but it is sometimes unmanned, a ticket machine is here too. Trains on this platform tend to go to Hastings."
6080,"Accessible buses stop on Bishopthorpe Road opposite Southlands Methodist Church, a short distance from the Richardson Street Park entrance. 
Disabled parking available at Rowntree Park car park and at Bishopthorpe Road car park, both roughly 300m from the cafe."
6081,"Staff at all points were very helpful and friendly. They helped us with a map and with how the audio guide works. The cafe folk were fabulous and gave us all the time we needed to settle, shake off the rain, and decide on whether it would be a large cake or two or maybe the enormous bacon rolls that were on offer. "
6082,"Although only one disabled bay, it’s right by the hotels entrance, and other bays are very handy anyway. The entrance into hotel is on the level, with a push wooden door that’s easy to use. Being so excited to view this beautiful hotel, we forgot to check if lifts are available, but all we needed to see was on ground floor level anyway."
6083,"I found the cinema itself to be sub-par relative to other Edinburgh cinemas in terms of safety, cost, quality, and value."
6084,One accessible loo with good turning and transferring space. Drop down rails available along with a red cord card. 
6085,Access was pain free from leaving the car to getting in the sit-ski!
6086,Most were extremely kind and helpful.
6087,The ramps to the front door and to the pool were great but there was even a ramp over the rail for the patio door making it very easy to get in and out. All doors were wide enough for most wheelchairs or scooters. The wet room was brilliant with lots of space to turn my scooter around. There was a support rail next to the toilet and a fold-up stool on the wall of the shower. The floor was non-slip with a wheelchair space under the toilet. Everything in the kitchen was easily accessible with a space under the sink and hob.
6088,Staff good. No one particularly helpful but seemed to work well and there weren't any problems...
6089,"This is a newish venue underneath the railway arches so is constrained by the nature of the space, but they have tried really hard.  It is formed of 2 separate 'tunnels' which each have ramp access. The bar is in one and the stage in the other.  There is a disabled access loo in the bar area. Unfortunately wheelchair users have to go outside and back in again in order to move between the two tunnels but I can't see how the venue could have avoided this.  There is no VP or dedicated viewing area."
6090,"No steps, easily accessible."
6091,"The toilets are well-signposted. The disabled loo is of a good size, with plenty of room to manoeuvre a wheelchair. They are clean and clutter-free and have grab rails in-situ."
6092,See review.
6093,"Staff appear to be well trained in supporting people with diverse needs, as the West Yorkshire Playhouse also runs showings for people with dementia and different access needs. 

Very friendly and happy to help."
6094,Brilliant. Closemat toilet and rise 'n fall wash basin.
6095,really nice and helpful let us have our meals at different times. so that our PA's could eat after us
6096,Single 3 inch step into the venue. Once inside everything was level and there was space to move.
6097,"It was on the level from the car park, but can only make use of the bar lounge area, as from then on its was steps, so that was disappointing. "
6098,Lovely staff.
6099,Drive right up to the front door - oodles of transfer space and often a helping hand on offer! 
6100,"There are 2 entrances into this restaurant, one with one step up and another with complete level access, just now automatic door pad. Unfortunately this restaurant loses one star because there was only one table that my friend and I could sit at because we are both wheelchair users, luckily we booked. On the level access there is only 2 wheelchair level tables as the rest are high tables, but one of the wheelchair level tables is at a booth so only one wheelchair would be able to sit at it. You'd also struggle to get into it as there are chairs in the way, so people would have to move to let you past.

Our table was a perfect size for our wheelchairs though. Without the issue though that there is only one, possibly two, wheelchair accessible tables, there is plenty of space at the bar area and around the high tables. I think there are more wheelchair level tables within the other seat area upstairs, but there is no lift."
6101,Easy to get around with our buggy friendly animals can't wait to come back to see it aluminized in September!
6102,A nice ramp from the pavement into the outdoor seating area (under cover) with a door that opens outwards. Seating inside is flexible
6103,There is a bus stop right outside the site and you have 2 private parking spaces outside the lodge.
6104,The reception staff were very good. In the restaurant and bar I felt that they could have been a little more attentive and customer orientated. Having had three meals there not once did they remove the plates after we finished eating nor offer to wash my personal eating utensils. Gotta drink from the bar meant my wife having to go to collect drinks at the bar even when the bat was quiet. 
6105,Staff were generally pleasant and helpful with questions or requests.
6106,It has ramps to the entrance of the mall from the parking and a doorman to assist into the mall for disable people.
6107,"There are clearly marked disabled bays in the car park next to the visitors centre, which is a good starting point for the outing. If it is after 5, when the centre closes, you can easily park on the causeway next to the centre."
6108,Visitors who want to drive and have Blue Badges can park adjacent to the main entrance. Buses pass along Princes Street and Lothian Road. Approaching from these roads does require negotiating steps. If you are wheeling there you need to approach from Kings Stable Road which is off Lothian Road. It's about 150m from the road to the entrance.
6109,"All the staff from the reception team through to the restaurant staff and the people looking after the rooms were great. Nothing was too much trouble. They moved the beds for us, helped to find the best table in the restaurant for access for my wheelchair, and offered help in the self service breakfast area. The front of house team were friendly and offered helpful advice about the local area. Their collective efforts made the visit easier than expected and a place I and my colleague would certainly visit again."
6110,We came in a minibus and it was easy to park
6111,"The most lovely group of people! They couldn’t do enough to help us. One thing is for certain, the staff’s care and want to help make our experience the best it possibly could be. They weren’t intrusive helping, but they made sure we were never far away from a set of hands should we need them.
Whatever Moniack sacrificed in accessibility for its period charm and ethereal time travel feel, the staff made up for by the barrel load in a kind and considerate way."
6112,"Only hoist we found was in pool.  Other toilets are the standard ones, nice and clean - but still a case of lying on the floor for us :( many toilets didn't have red cords in them."
6113,"Having bought here prior to becoming disabled, I really wanted to purchase here. Was with my daughter so when we saw two steps, she went and asked whether they had a ramp. ""No"" was the answer and no help offered.
After posting about this on Twitter I was told (1) it was an old building which couldn't be altered; (2) disabled customers could buy via their website; (3) a ramp would block the path and (4)they didn't have enough staff to put a ramp out.
Well:
(1)  No alteration needed; just purchase one or possibly 2 portable ramps.
(2) If they had directed me to this at the time, I could have chosen my purchases. They didn't. Besides, they could make it possible for customers with access needs to enter.
(3) Stonegate is very wide and portable ramps would only be a temporary impediment, if at all.
(4) Maybe they need more staff? Actuallt the shop seemed empty when I visited and as the till is right next to the door, it should be possible for one member of staff to faciliate a ramp.

What was lacking was willingness."
6114,Great toilet/ wet room with grab rails and shower chair if needed.
6115,I used accessible loos at various places in the town - all were adequate
6116,"County Hall is on London's Southbank next to the London Eye. The entrance of Witness for the Prosecution is located on Belvedere Road. The nearest tube or train station is Waterloo. Waterloo tube has some step free access but it depends which line and entrance you use. The Jubilee Line at Waterloo via Waterloo Hall entrance is step free with lift access between street and platform. And the Bakerloo Line via York Road entrance also. For all  other options please check with TFL (Transport for London) website. 
Westminster tube station is also close by and has step free access on Circle and District Lines.
Both Westminster and Waterloo Bridges are wheelchair accessible, as are the Golden Jubilee Bridges, connecting the South Bank with Victoria Embankment on the north side.
There are a few buses routes that stop a couple of minutes walk from County Hall."
6117,We were able to park right outside on single yellows. Not sure if there are any Blue Badge parking spaces nearby. There are good public transport links with several bus stops nearby.
6118,Lovely spot with fancy cocktails and good accessibility for wheelchairs
6119,Very easy.
6120,"Car park changes made and provision of a Shuttle Bus on demand for wheelchairs, mobility scooters and a tail lift that someone can stand on for access to the bus too if unable to use the steps. 
I was dropped off by taxi which then waited for me in the car park.  I returned to it using the Shuttle Bus but the House staff would have radioed the Welcome Centre to send the taxi back to me too if I had asked. 
There is a bus stop outside, Johnson's No. 6 that runs between Stratford upon Avon and Banbury."
6121,There is a bathroom with facilities for disables as you can see on their website. There is also a shower chair. There is space for a carer.
6122,We stayed here overnight in one of the hotels accessible rooms. I cannot recomend it highly enough. The room was very spacious with 2 twin beds. The room had an on suite bathroom with handrails and a pull down shower seat. There is a red cord in the shower. Ther is also an emergency call button in the room itself. Staff are so friendly and helpful and complete an personal Emergency Evacuation plan with all Disabled guests. All Travelodge accessible rooms should have wet room bathrooms available.
6123,Small step at front door and didn’t inquire if there was any alternative access
6124,No car park. I suspect you could park outside.  There's a public parking area just round the corner.
6125,"After reviewing things to do in Blyth, the Battery was one place we wanted to visit..  We were not disappointed although, due to the age of the units, it was not ideal for wheelchair users."
6126,It is all on one level but the main door is quite heavy so bring someone with you. The lesson is the staff see you trying to open the door they do leap into action to help.
6127,Changing places toilets available airside in arrivals. To access these on an outbound journey please ask staff for assistance
6128,"easy access  , plenty of room , good grab rails , alarm cord accessible , and easy to use facilities. Disabled loos on each floor which is excellent. might benefit from adding the wheelchair sign to the male and female figures on the clear signage as then would negate having to ask which floor the disabled facilities were on.Would have given it 5 stars if it has been clearer!"
6129,"The music was fabulous. If you like classical music, an orchestral concert in the Great Hall here will be a delight, whether it's the Vienna Philharmonic or, as in our case, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra."
6130,being able to get all the way around and the beautiful views
6131,"Lots of space for chair and carer.
( sorry can’t remember about rails!)
"
6132,"Because it is far from town, it is inadvisable to go if you have no lift.
There are disabled blue badge places in the shore front car park but people may have to park up the hill."
6133,This is near the centre of Sunderland and we travelled by car. The museum has good displays and the staff are knowledgable about the articles. The cafe was friendly and easy to manouver around. The museum was clean and the lift an adequate size for my powerchair and also weight capacity good. there are demonstations daily during the week and on a lot of days workshops as well. there is of course a shop which sells glass articles made there can be purchased. we had a great day. I assume the toilets so cannot make a comment.
6134,There is one disabled toilet at the side beside stores and the kitchen. It is raised loo and has grab bars and a 'paperclip'. It is big enough for a wheelchair.
6135,Possible
6136,"Breezy Knees is a garden, nursery and café at Stockton on the Forest near York. It is made up of various different gardens separated by fences or hedges - there are gardens for different times of the year plus the beautifully scented rose garden, shade garden, rock garden, cottage garden and many more, including fountains and ponds. a couple of the gardens are not wheel-accessible but the vast majority of it is, including the café which also has outside seating."
6137,"The restaurant and bar have good access for wheelchair users. Enter via the door round the back to the right of the main entrance. Fully accessible toilet.
The ""wheelchair accessible"" accommodation is only accessible via entrances with 1 step and narrow corridors etc. There's not much room to get round in the bedroom, no accessible bathroom / toilet and no adaptations whatsoever.
I managed but it wasn't easy and I don't think many others would.
Staff communicated with me by text quite happily and were very helpful."
6138,Footbridge from station but platform accessible via ramp next to carpark
6139,Plenty of space; Kitchen work surfaces raise and lower
6140,"We visited on a cold Christmas Eve (last outing before lockdown.) Many countryside areas and viewpoints have no accessible toilet, so it is very helpful that the National Park has provided this facility."
6141,"Excellent, very friendly and willing, and I can assure you they will support you all the way."
6142,"The hotel has 2 separate entrances almost adjacent to each other. Both have clear glass, automatic double doors, see photo. There is a reception desk at standing height and a spacious lobby/ lounge area. There is lots of seating but the sofas are very low down, see photo, so I didn’t even try to use them as I would never have been able to get up unaided. On the photo behind the seating is a low wall with a padded cover on top, which provides additional seating. Also in the photos of lobby area are large pebble cushions, which playful nod to  Nice having a pebble rather than sandy beach.

On the ground floor there is also a step free bar with free standing tables and chairs, see photos, which I didn’t visit during my stay. There is also a step restaurant, accessed via a shallow slope. The restaurant area has free standing tables and chairs. The breakfast is self service with counters at standing height. 

I pre-booked an accessible room. There was no option to book an accessible room on the hotel’s website, but when I emailed them they replied promptly that they had an accessible room available. However, they had no photos of the room, and didn’t offer to take some photos for me. The room was classed as a superior room, but I was still slightly anxious about what to expected. However, I didn’t need to worry. I had room 123 on the first floor, with a street view. It was close to the lift. The room was opened manually using a key fob. The room was quite spacious. There was a double bed with a comfortable but firm mattress. There were bedside tables, desk and chair. There was a built in wardrobe/ shelves which is the only thing in the room which was not perfect. The wardrobe rail was high up so only accessible at standing height and the wardrobe space was quite short, fine for jackets and shirts but my dresses trailed on the floor of the wardrobe. There was limited shelving, which was fine for me on my own for a few days. Inside the wardrobe space was a small electronic safe (tablet not laptop size) which was at a good, easy to use height and there was no additional charge to use it. There was also a fridge which contained a minibar. There was also a kettle and flat screen TV with limited English channels. The wifi was free and excellent throughout the hotel.

My ensuit bathroom was very spacious, see photos. There was a step free, roll in shower with a single horizontal grab rail and fold down shower chair with no arms. There was no shower screen or curtain and there was slate tiled flooring. I wear flip flops when I shower on holiday if there isn’t an obvious non slip flooring and I felt very safe in the shower area. The water did go on the floor but it dried very quickly without me having to wipe it. The toilet had a single grab rail on the wall and there was space under the sink for wheelchair access. 

I was very impressed with my room, it was comfortable, very clean and beautifully decorated with the painting above the bed, lovely bed linen and the wooden shutters at the windows. I loved my room and it was perfect for me. As well as my mobility disability, I had recently had a hysterectomy and I’m still feeling very tired at the end of the day. I knew after a day sightseeing, I was looking for a comfortable/ cosy room which I could relax in from early evening and feel that it was a treating myself rather than missing out going out for the evening, and this hotel and room was just what I was looking for."
6143, Great place to meet up for a drink or something to eat .  Wheelchair accessible  from pavement.  Nice beer garden for sunny days.  Indoors there is a large screen for essentialviewing of sport.  Staff are friendly and helpful .
6144,There is a step at the entrance. The restaurant has no wheelchair ramp. I was not able to get in. Zero stars.
6145,"The Fisherman's Retreat is a restaurant in Ramsbottom, Bury. We were looking at to hold our wedding there. A beautiful place in a stunning location but it is very hilly and difficult to navigate. 

The main entrance has two good double doors to get into but unfortunately we did have to ask for the other one to be opened. There are steps to each dinning room in which they do have a metal removable ramp for, really not ideal. There are good disabled toilets with grab rails. 

Overall it’s not great for accessibility."
6146,Plenty of disabled parking available.
6147,"As I said above, they were brilliant, welcoming, knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful and helped to make my visit special."
6148,"A relative had been years ago, it had only reopened recently after Covid and not all areas were open, but we had a very good guide who took us round and gave us lots of background detail. "
6149,This visit was arranged in advance using WelcomeByNeatebox.  The Greeter knew I was coming and what I needed to do and organised seating accordingly.  Other staff approached me knowing my name and were helpful and friendly.
6150,The trams are superb for accessibility - the challenge is getting to them. You may have to use one of the car parks or on street parking if you're not located in one of the shore front hotels or you're visiting for the day.
6151,Flat entry throughout with automatic doors into reception from the outside. Very friendly staff. Corridors are fine but no room to pass cleaning carts.  The room was larger than average and in twin layout there would be room for a hoist in bed and bathroom (possibly not to travel in hoist to bathroom with hoist legs extended wide). Bed would need risers to hoist. Plenty of room for using an over toilet shower chair but very little space under the shower due to over installation of support bars. Small moveable side table. Very soft bed.
6152,Staff are extremely helpful and very willing to give directions within the building to the lost -looking tourist...
6153,"As I mentioned before, not all of the walking routes are accessible to wheelchairs, and therefore I can't give the access rating 5 stars. However, there are plenty of walks that are accessible to wheelchairs, and so if you're looking for a day out with both wheelchair uses and non wheelchair users, this trail definitely ticks that box. In regard to restaurant facilities, I have never used these myself, but I have seen plenty of wheelchair accessible restaurants around the Abbey."
6154,"I understand that you can book a blue badge parking space for £7 per day by the cathedral. We wanted to spend some time in the city centre, so we chose to park in the Cranebridge Road carpark (free parking for blue badge holders), which was a 5 - 10 minute wheel away."
6155,"There was one disabled toilet next to the cafe. The only negative is the door is heavy and on a tightly sprung hinge, so it takes a few goes to get in. The toilet is newly refurbished and the decor is lovely. There is a red emergency pull cord that reaches the floor. There are rails and plenty of space. A small sink isn't ideal but does allow for better use of the space. There are paper towels for drying your hands. You don't need a radar key for this and the lock is actually disabled friendly as it has a long handle and not stiff. "
6156,The staff were welcoming and offered support wherever possible. 
6157,Parking is good and fairly spacious . Surface is tarmac. 
6158,"This is a lovely stroll/wheel along the side of the Ouseburn. It's undulating in parts though the paths are good. My walk starts from the parking by the visitor centre /petting farm and goes to the old mill and back. The upper reaches have good paths but are quite steep. Beyond the mill, there are steps so we didn't get past here."
6159,Plenty of accessible toilets. One on every floor. There is a lift but it isn't huge.
6160,"Through main entrance, across the plaza, then up the ramp to the right towards the bar, and through a door on the right. Toilet is on the right."
6161,"Had a great evening at India quay. Staff reserved a table for us on the ground floor. Easy level entrance from the street overlooking the squinty bridge. Wide door entrance at the front next to the revolving door perfect for powered chair. Food was excellent, very tasty and fresh. There is a disabled toilet on the ground floor too. Lots of room between table made access easy.  Parking for WAV not easy but we found a space up a nearby side street.  "
6162,Parking is limited but more than enough for the cafe and cemetery. Just no designated disabled bays. Best to get there by car/van as not on a main bus route. 
6163,"There is one at the entrance floor, before you go down to the seats, which is big enough for a carer and has handrails. There is another downstairs, on the Stalls floor which is fine once you're in but problematic to get to alone in a chair because of the tight connecting doors which only prop open if someone has already wedged them open. You need them both open to get a chair through."
6164,"Spacious, modern accessible loo, but emergency cord was tied up when I visited. Also not a huge amount of contrast between floor and walls."
6165,"A 4 star hotel & spa, not far from both Hastings & Battle & is ideally situated for exploring 1066 Country.
Although with some shortcomings, this is a disabled friendly hotel, and  has two adapted bedrooms for disabled guests. My review only looks at the hotel as I did not visit the spa, which is located adjacent to the main hotel.  "
6166,"The whole hotel is accessible, with lifts to all floors. After we checked in, someone appeared to explain the emergency evacuation procedure, which I have never experienced before, but it was good to know."
6167,Inside the Hotel is a wheelchair Lift for the split Level interior and Lifts to most floors. We had to go around the back of the Hotel to gain Level access.
6168,"Good level access, with no steps. There is plenty of room for a wheel chair."
6169,"numerous toilets all spacious and good in number
Sinage is good"
6170,Demonstrated equipment. Very helpful and friendly.
6171,"The car park is across the road. There are disabled spaces, but I'd estimate it's maybe 200m away from the entrance. If distance isn't an issue this is fine, but if you want to park closer you can't. "
6172,There are toilets at all the main buildings. They are basic but well maintained and clean. There are alarm call cords for emergency use 
6173,A wheelchair accessible art gallery in the heart of Glasgow. There is a lovely cafe situated in the main lobby on the ground floor. The doors are wide enough for wheelchair access however some of the entrances do not have automatic doors. There is a lift on site which does not require staff permission for use which is ideal for accessing te second floor galleries. There is no audio in the lift. Overall I believe that Kelvingrove is a suitable place for all and a great way to spend a winter day. Wheelchair accessible parking is available on site also. 
6174,Drove by car. Gravel car park with unmarked parking spaces - no disabled parking.
6175,"There is an accessible toilet. During my visit I found that some thoughtless person had stacked a load of spare chairs in it (see my photo below), which made a sideways wheelchair-to-toilet transfer impossible. Accessible toilets are NOT store-rooms! All the available space is required by a wheelchair for manoeuvring and for transfer to the toilet."
6176,Nice wide automatic doors but there is a small lip on the way in which could be problematic for some wheelchair users and people with visual impairments.
6177,The family and staff here are very welcoming and friendly. Nothing was a bother. Attentive but not intrusive 
6178,there is parking all around the Abbey with designated Bays available
6179,"Clean and tidy toilet, not a changing places toilet though. Big enough to move about in but you could struggle if you had a lot of kit. "
6180,"The staf are always very helpful, opening doors, and carrying drinks if needed."
6181,Staff happy to help
6182,Large car park with plenty of blue badge spaces with hatchings between and behind. Parking is free. Level entry from car park into store.
6183,The restaurant was level access and I found there to be plenty space to move about.
6184,Access into and around the store was fairly easy as a wheelchair user. There was plenty of space between the various displays and it was possible to see most things easily.
6185,"Closest to disabled seating there were 2.  One of which was also a designated baby child change.  Queues for disabled far worse than for those with no disabilities...... instead you had people making comments about ""your not disabled "" "" you can't use this without a key"""
6186,"The visitor centre is a purpose-built modern complex which was easily accessible. It had an automatic door at the main entrance, other automatic doors at key points and was easy to wheel around the bright spacious and light area. We enjoyed visiting the exhibition area which is full of exhibits and curios from burns life. It was a little dark in places but we understand this is to preserve the exhibits.

The shop and ticket area were easy to access with plenty of space to move around and easy to see things.  The Cafe was busy but again was easily accessible with plenty of staff on hand to lend a hand.

Burns cottage being an historical site was a little more challenging for me as a wheelchair user. That said, I was able to get into the cottage and wheel through the rooms, albeit a traditional stone flagged floor in places, and see everything that I wanted to. The adjacent gardens were also fairly accessible. The path from the cottage car park up to the gardens and cottage however was much more challenging with a rough gravel chipping style of surface which wheeling difficult. "
6187,"Not far off the M1 at J31. The road in is good and there is plenty of parking. As you arrive, your number plate is recorded. If you are a blue badge holder, you take it to the office and register it and then you can park for free. Everyone else should pay before leaving. 

I visited with my motorhome today and parked in the coach park. It is flat and not far from the main car park.

Update: I returned the next day, with the same motorhome, having been told I only needed to register my blue badge once. When I left, the barrier didn't lift. I pressed the help button and he told me to use the next lane. I explained that I'm a huge motorhome and it didn't look big enough but he insisted. I persuaded the cars behind me to reverse and tried the next lane. I was too wide. I had to get out of the motorhome to get to the help button (without my wheelchair) and explain that I couldn't fit. He told me if I went back to the first lane, he would lift it manually as he could see that my blue badge was registered. By now there was a huge queue which all had to reverse again. Can't understand why this happened but I wasn't impressed and have dropped the parking score by one star. "
6188,"The wet room in Valley view is very large and my brothers carer was able to move around.  Very clean and tidy.

Downstairs toilet in Brambles Barn"
6189,"The entrance is step free and the bookshop has room for manoeuvre in a wheelchair, but there is not lift to the basement, so half of the bookshop is completely inaccessible to wheelchair users. Not recommended."
6190,There is a car park at Vall Nord at the bottom of the gondola and at the top.  The gondola is accessed by a ramp in Arinsal and with help from the lefties. 
6191,"Access from our drop off point, we arrived by bus, there was level access into the station. We also ventured out of the station via the ramp up to street level. Although quite steep it was possible without too much effort. Once inside the station there were clear signs where things were. A dropped counter at the booking office made getting help easier."
6192,"Amazing, super friendly and nice, recognise repeat and loyal customers."
6193,"This is a traditional Gents Barbour's shop on Coatbridge Main St opposite Coatbridge Fountain, The nearest public transport link is at the main bus stop in the town around 900 meters away. 
The shop is not that big however there are 3 chair points to have your hair cut these are swivel type chairs with arm rests.
There is a waiting area as you go in the door with a number of chairs along the wall    "
6194,I parked right outside it and the bust stop is a 2 minute walk
6195,"I needed to ask where the accessible toilet was and a staff member brought the key and showed me. You have to go back out to the porch where the loo was but it didn't open straight into the path of people going in or out of the pub. The toilet area was clean with everything within reach. The hand dryer was actually a good one and powerful one. There was a handrail but it would have needed moving down. I couldn't have done it on my own or reached it due to the sanitary box next to the loo.
There wasn't a Changing Places toilet and it would have been a squash to have 2 people in there plus a wheelchair."
6196,"At the entrance to where you do the gin tasting, there is a small portable ramp permanently placed to allow easier access for visitors who struggle with steps. You first enter into the Eden Mill gift shop which is spacious enough for wheelchair users and there is seats here for you to relax and finish off your drinks after your tasting session has finished. Some of the shelves are quite high for visitors to reach items for sale however, there is always a member of staff available to help. The till area was at a reasonable height for wheelchairs.

You then go behind the gift shop and into another area where the tasting sessions take place. There was a small fabric ramp to help access here (see image). When I visited there were 3 tables set up however, only one was really accessible to me in my wheelchair and it was the one right in front as you entered. The tables and chairs are able to moved around though so, if you wanted to sit further in then I’m sure they would try to accommodate this. The tables are made out of old barrels and are quite high up, I am able to raise my wheelchair up but I did still struggle to reach my drink because of my footplates. Luckily I had my carer with me to help pass me my drink. You are able to see the area where staff present during each session. 

There are a few barrel tables available outside beside the carpark which is also quite spacious."
6197,"Great disabled access automatic doors on entry, lifts to all floors, accessible rooms are large and very spacious and bathrooms fitted with full wet-room which is also very spacious. "
6198,"Very Good - Profiling bed with a carers bed in the Accessible Accomodation but NO HOIST, there is an Accessible Hot tub on your patio WITH A HOIST, NO HOIST or shower trolley in the Accessible bathroom, NO HOIST in the Accessible swimming tropical pool but there is a height adjustable shower trolley"
6199,Well run with everything you need in place.
6200,Staff were really helpful. They explained that some of the heritage trams were not accessible but these are interspersed with the main modern trams. We were helped to manoeuvre into the wheelchair space and to get off safely at our stop.
6201,"Accessible toilet, well signposted, grab rails available. Plenty of room & clean. "
6202,See my review
6203,Very dirty and unhygienic
6204,Stopped for refreshments on a very long and wet journey. Parked outside the front door and followed the clear signage to the toilets and then the cafe. Food was great and there was a huge Shop with a wide selection of gifts and clothes as well as the usual garden centre products. Worth a visit even if you don't have a garden!
6205,All very nice and happy to carry drinks to tables
6206,"The street food available at this restaurant is 2nd to none. I have tried almost everything on the menu now, I am that big a fan. Not only is the food is amazing but because they are based in a listed building, they have used imagination to make the venue accessible. For example, there is plenty of seating on the lower level and they have put in a removable lift so that anyone with a disability can reach the toilets on the upper level. There is nothing stopping you from visiting now!"
6207,Ignorant and unhelpful ticket office staff
6208,Unfortunately you do have to be able to walk about 4 meters I’d guess. 
6209,Seats were provided for those who were watching and waiting for their turn. The walkway from the carpark to the bikes and football pitch is all concrete.
6210," We travelled to the restaurant by car  and because the restaurant is in the centre of town  and Edinburgh festival is on we had to park on one of the sidestreets .  It was still close to the  restaurant .
 There are  also plenty bus  stops nearby."
6211,Good access throughout centre and easy to get around inside TOG 24 store.
6212,The access for disabled people at Cheltenham racecourse is brilliant! The space around the venue is brilliant. There is a lot of space for wheelchair users to move around and it's all carpeted once you get in. The lifts were small but they had two of them.
6213,Awful. Please see other comments. 
6214,"Easy access to viewing platform, great view of stage. However ramp was steep"
6215,Loads of on street parking and double yellows 2 yds from front door.
6216,Staff helpful and offered to carry beverages to a table.
6217,Toilet in A&E was clean and easy to get a full powerchair into. The red cord was a red plastic pipe and touched the floor. First time ive seen a stiffened pipe cord. Well done chesterfield hospital
6218,We arrived by car and visited the visitor centre first. Some handy blue badge parking spaces were very close to the main entrance. We discovered that you could drive to the Burns cottage and also park in handy accessible spaces by the entrance.
6219,"Unfortunately I can't comment on local transport as we parked but we parked perfectly fine in the car park provided, around 10 metres from the cottage."
6220,"A real mixture of things to see here - traveller caravans, vintage cars, roman pipes and coffins, orchard and old barns, kitchens, agricultural history, an old Victorian school room, old toys and vintage clothes,  and a Great Hall - all wheelchair accessible."
6221,The staff were great and helpful at the forum and good to talk to them and the staff were good.
6222,"The clearly signed toilet is near the front door, in the corridor between the bar and production area. It is clean and tidy with space for a wheelchair and carer. It has grab rails and an alarm."
6223,"Only really accessible by car. Given the high proportion of seniors demographically, there is need for more disabled parking spaces."
6224,There is a bus route and a few parking spaces
6225,Entrance via cloisters for wheelchair users with ramp into the abbey also ramp into café and shop area within the abbey
6226,"Only met Chris who was keen to offer any assistance. Very friendly host.

"
6227,The accessible loos are huge including all the usual grab rails etc - and also provide showering facilities.  Also well maintained and clean
6228,"Disabled access around the hotel is good. We stayed in room 001. Plenty of space to get around. The hotel had provided a seat for the shower. The toilet in ensuite had rails. But no rails for the shower. 

In the public area was a well equipped disabled toilet

Staff very helpful. I needed to bring my scooter in to be charged. No problem at all and I was able to leave it charging securely in a meeting room"
6229,"So often on FB there are negative experiences with disabled young people so I thought I'd tell you about a positive one. We've spent the afternoon at the Birmingham Symphony Hall listening to the CBSO accompany the film 'Frozen' it was a fabulous performance that we both really enjoyed. We had brilliant seats.. I didn't pay for mine as am a career, I pre booked a disabled parking space that was right outside the main entrance to Symphony Hall, which again I didn't pay for, and was courteously escorted to on arrival. I felt like the Queen ! ( without the pastel two piece suit!lol) and Elly was definitely a princess!! Well done THSH we've had a lovely afternoon"
6230,"A regular accessible toilet, however it was very clean and had electronic locking. "
6231,"It is with some regret we can only offer one star. You see the visit didn't go at all well. When approach the main entrance the steward on duty chose to ignore me and talk to my companion when answering my questions. A ramp was eventually offered but the look of the ramp; a 'homemade' plywood sheet like thing was enough to put us off. Any attempt to use the ramp down the single step would have been unsafe if not dangerous. It did not look robust enough to take the weight of my powerchair and was so short I would be traversing the step at 45 degrees and my chair can't cope with that. Why, go why ... wasn't there a proper portable ramp available? Any requests for alternative routes or places to explore were dismissed ... It really sent a strong message to me of ""we don't cater for people like you' ...

Going around the back of the castle revealed the shop and cafe. Such a pity the doorway was surrounded by tables and chairs; as well as a deep gravel that made getting anywhere near the door impossible! If you're a wheelchair user then this is a place to avoid!"
6232,There were two accessible toilets on the first floor. You did need to negotiate one of the two lifts to get up to that level. You come out of the lift into the seating area for the food court so on some occasions it was challenging to negotiate the tables and people. The loos themselves were fine with good wide doors and room to turn.
6233,Friendly Wheelchair accessible pub 
6234,"Visited to try out my new power chair . Huge Park, well kept grounds with various activities for kids , an accessible café on site, and a pub and accessible restaurant beside the park. All of the Park is on the level, and easy to manoeuvre around.Some of the facilities eg. the toilets, mini golf , bowling green and trampolines close at 5pm"
6235,"QMU Student. Visited the Kingsgate centre various times throughout the week to assess how accessible it was. Busy shopping centre with good variety of shops, built on two levels."
6236,A lift provides wheelchair accessibility  from floors -4 to 1.
6237,Level access from Buchanan Street. Wide double doors. Lots of circulation space in the shop. Cafe area at back with easy to move furniture and adequate circulation space. Bench seating is firm and for me was easy to transfer to. 
6238,Level access to and from the cafe and gift shop. There is a swing door to enter which is pretty heavy. May provide a problem for anyone with an upper body impairment.
6239,access on ground floor over wooden decking slippery in wet. the doors are complicated to navigate 
6240,A small and friendly  fish restaurant on the outskirts of the village of Fairlie.
6241,"The staff were all friendly and helpful, they talked us through our group visit when we arrived and provided us with information based on any shows which were being displayed on the day. There were staff members spread out across each floor so if we needed help it would have been easy to ask a member of staff. "
6242,"Automatic doors to get into the shop, wide aisles and relatively low desks at the tills. The lift at the back is a little small, but easy to get to and well signposted. "
6243,Access to Central Station is easy by public transport.
6244,Fine for powered chair
6245,"Brilliant extremely helpful. When I arrived at the Cromwell Road entrance one of the V and A volunteers came over to me to ask me if I needed help. I asked if I could borrow a wheelchair and she took me to where they store the wheelchairs. I had arranged to meet my friend, we had got our meeting points a bit muddled up, and she was already at the exhibition entrance. The volunteer offered to wheel me to the exhibition where my friend was waiting. I so appreciated this gesture.
In the gift shop at the end of the exhibition I went over to the counter and informed the staff about the two slopes in the shop. They said they had already thought about it and hadn't been sure about it. I suggested that some marking on  the floor to make people aware would be helpful. They agreed to review the flooring."
6246,The restaurant is located on the 7th floor over the car park. We parked in one of the blue badge spaces on the Sydenham Rd level (which I think is level four of the car park) . There were only a few blue badge  spaces but I don't know if there are any other spaces on other levels.  Of course the downside is having to pay as the spaces are inside the multi storey however after 6 on a Saturday it's only £1.
6247,"We entered at Royal circle level from shopping centre/car park. Signage clear, gentle ramps everywhere but heavy doors into theatre itself (wheelchair won't fit through just one door so you've got to open both doors in each set). Staff offered assistance on way in.  Lift from Royal circle level to stalls at ground level or vice versa."
6248,"Extremely friendly and helpful staff.
Felt we could have asked for any assistance we needed."
6249,I parked at a parking service near the airport which was excellent.
6250,The museum tells the story of Crete’s naval history and features many battle stories. 
6251,Couldn’t get most wheelchairs into the accessible loo. It was up two steps from where we were. Really badly laid out too. 
6252,Loose Gravel paths.
6253,Free on street Disabled parking outside venue.  Venue opposite Ilkley Railway station. Arrive early as parking limited.
6254,"The Centre is on the main road running down from Inverness alongside the Loch Ness. It’s about fourteen miles until you reach the village of Drumnadrochit.

There are plenty of parking spaces and a row of accessible parking bays can be found as you enter the one way route. From here it’s a short stroll across the garden area to the entrance to the exhibition.
"
6255,"As with any medieval building, city or environment you can only do so much to achieve complete accessibility. The modifications that the City of York has and Minster are excellent, but of course being profoundly VI I can only explain how positive, friendly people were in offering support, even though I aspire to be as independent as possible. In shops I really like that when people spotted the Cane, they asked if they could be of assistance, gave great explanation and contactless payment provision was universal."
6256,"Staff really helpful, good access."
6257,"If you are in a wheelchair, then furniture needs to be moved to access the toilet. Great pity really. It was the only downside. Otherwise it was well thought out."
6258,"They have clearly put a lot of thought and planning into accessible facilities, which is great. I did use the toilet a couple of times but I mostly use my own. There is a key code on each toilet door and they give you the code on arrival, but it's a bit pointless really as the locks seem to not work and if you just pull the door they open anyway. 

The elsan point (where you empty the motorhome toilet) is on a level concrete path and is low enough to reach from a wheelchair. I've had a look at it and hope to test it out on my final morning. Big well done to the planners though on this one, as emptying the loo is rarely manageable on my own!"
6259,Not sure if their would have been a nearer stop of point or parking facilities as it is a park 
6260,A beautiful location but actual beach access is difficult if not impossible.
6261,"Generally good access, but there is no signage to the lifts, which are all hidden in dark corners; the lighting is awful throughout the shop; and the accessible toilet has some problems.

"
6262,"Very friendly, helpful staff at reception."
6263,"Staff are generally good but there can be shortage of staff at busy times. Early morning or late evening it can be difficult to find staff with barrier unstaffed and travel centre closed. 

If the staff have time they are very helpful eg will carry drinks for you from cafe to train or get water for guide dog."
6264,Very friendly! There were lots of wheelchairs users at the station and they helped everyone get on and off when needed and were happy to answer anyone's questions.
6265,"The staff are kind and helpful and really genuinely seem to want to help. From the station staff to the train staff, volunteers and paid staff alike want to give you the best chance to make the most of your visit. They have, at great expense, put in a couple of carriages with a lift from platform to train and kitted out the carriage with space for wheelchairs and fold up chairs for your family to sit with you."
6266,"There is disabled parking behind the DCA, there is a lift that takes you up to the bar and cinema floor which is smallish but no smaller than a lift you might find in a hotel or sports place. At the moment you are only meant to have the person in the lift so didn’t feel that cramped for me."
6267,"A gorgeous venue, great staff. A little disappointed that it didnt have the greatest accessibility."
6268,"The first row of parking all the way around the complex has additional space blocked out on each side, allowing for car doors to be fully opened. 
Transport to this venue is fairly limited unless you would be driving, there are a few buses that do stop, however the bus stop is in the middle of the car park, so to get to the main pathway you would need to cross traffic. 
"
6269,"Had to park in a car park in Barnard Castle.  There were blue badge spaces almost opposite the castle but we didn't notice them til later as they were so poorly marked. There were two or three spaces there. It took us about three minutes to get from the public car park to the castle on foot - it's through the town on mostly good pavements, dropped kerbs etc. . It's downhill ever so slightly."
6270,The steep incline to the disabled ramp or numerous steps from the council car park lets it down.  Inside too cluttered but is need when busy.
6271,There is one toilet in the tea room and it is spacious with hand rails. It does not have an emergency cord however. 
6272,Nice sport for a drink or some pub grub.
6273,The staff were very courteous and polite. They made me and my assistance dog feel very happy and welcomed. 
6274,"Very welcoming - a smile can say a thousand words if can’t speak Hebrew. On hand and very helpful, especially through security."
6275,"Restaurant is all on ground floor, although split level with some steps in one area, so make sure you specify if you have wheelchair access requirements.
Front door access is a little uneven with small changes in height and a couple of threshold bars, a little tricky, but everyone should be able to get in ok.
The restaurant has a spacious interior, with an accessible toilet on the ground floor.
City centre parking is challenging, however their are a few disabled parking spaces nearby."
6276,Verdant staff very helpful
6277,A council run sports centre that is easy to access by all and facilities a number of groups that are specific to individuals with disibility. 
6278,most staff are helpful
6279,"There was an accessible toilet on every floor, but we couldn't find the one on the ground floor. There are signs and the toilets were clean and well equipped. "
6280,"There are six disabled parking spaces in MIMA's car park and also more on the road next to the car park, the access between disabled spaces and the building is all level besides a one and a half inch lip at the floor of the back doors, the front entrance is more accessible and only requires you to go a short distance through the garden"
6281,"The walk at Callander Meadows is accessed from the big carpark on the left hand side of the main road in middle of Callander if heading towards Kilmahog. Simply follow the river round to the right and you'll be on the meadows path, a short but very accessible walk along the river. (Takes about 20mins). Some benches on route but they are few and far between once you leave the car park area. It's mainly flat, with one slope towards the end as you head  back to the car park if you want to do the full circle."
6282,They had lots of easy read poster and signs dotted around 
6283,"Gregorio was an excellent driver, very knowledgeable and he spoke English well. He was extremely thoughtful and considerate throughout the tour and would sometime park the vehicle so I could get a good view without having to get out. "
6284,"We drove to the event and parked in the SEC multi-storey car park adjacent to the venue. There are several levels to the car park, all with lots of disabled spaces located next to the ticket machines and lifts. The lifts were spacious and quick. 
There is a short walkway from the car park to the venue. It is wide, flat and has lifts down to the ground level entrance to the SEC area. "
6285,Narrow and not very obvious.
6286,Excellent. Parking with blue badge is in the hotel basement and is free for Blue Badge holders
6287,"What a team! Friendly, approachable and incredibly helpful. 

"
6288,Great. Very helpful and friendly. Recommend them very highly.
6289,Balmedie beach has a lovely small team of volunteers that hire out ( for free) various beach buggies and wheelchairs. There is a hoist and a change table etc. You have to call the number on their Facebook to book ( to make sure a team member is there to help you). They have 2 different sized hippocampe buggies and 3 other types. Something for everyone. Lovely to get into the beach with friends and family. 
6290,"All 4 lodges have huge wet-room. 
2/4 lodges have Clos-o-May toilets. 
All ground floor toilets are accessible- with one facilitating a left side transfer and the other a right side transfer. Grab rails around both the toilet and shower areas.  Ample space for carers to assist. Selection of S hower chairs and trolleys available for showering. "
6291,"The nearest bus stop is on the Northallerton high street as this centre is on an industrial estate.  It would be advised to use a car to get here where possible.  Plenty of parking available.  Even if disabled spots taken, there is lots of on street parking and it is a quiet area,"
6292,"easy  to find, plenty of space to manoeuvre, grab rails,  clean and tidy"
6293,The venue is all on the flat with spacious and clean disabled toilets and a good number of disabled bays close to the entrance.
6294,I parked in the eastgate centre and then walked to the coffee shop (About a 2-minute walk!) 
6295,"A wheelchair-accessible venue but not really for the single traveller. The site information does make mention of it being accessible but, in truth, there are a couple of tricky areas.
It is a wonderful place for views and bird watching and although only 5 minutes away from town, you could be miles away. Bear in mind that, whatever the weather when you leave home, it will be ten degrees colder here! "
6296,"There are lots of disabled parking spots, which are monitored for proper use.There are a number of buses that go to Merry Hill"
6297,Some parking outside. A few buses go through Stockbridge.
6298,"The trail is level. Surface is mostly compacted earth. To get to Tissington village, there's a short hill up and then down. My electric motor coped fine.mtheres no pavement on these short road sections so take care, especially summer and weekends.  The trail is popular with cyclists so again listen out ."
6299,Not that helpful and seemed to lack awareness. 
6300,"One of the best accessible breaks I have had. Totally wheelchair accessible in all rooms. Quality accommodation space and equipment.  Lovely hospitable and very helpful hosts, Felicity and David.
Surrounded by beautiful countryside many interesting places to visit."
6301,Very helpful staff.
6302,"Easy flat access to the foyer, box office, stalls, and cafe.  Many seats in the foyer.  However, no access to the first or second floor for wheelchair users (or people who have difficulty with stairs), so any talks or related events are usually inaccessible.  (Uncertain about provision and support for visual and audio impairment.)"
6303,Very helpful and willing to discuss needs.
6304,No car parking at all!
6305,A great family day out with good accessibility information and inclusion
6306,"Don't be put off attending this venue if you have mobility concerns as, with a little advance planning, access is easy.  The modern building has wide door and flat entrances, to both the upper and lower level.  However, we recommend letting the College and the production box office know in advance that you will be attending with walking aids or a wheelchair for two reasons:
1.  the space is very adaptable, meaning that the disabled seating moves depending on the layout used for a particular event/production.  We have found it useful to check in advance which entrance to should use.
2.  the Porters knew we were coming and so met us at a side gate, which we had parked right beside;  the side gate is very close to the theatre.  Otherwise, we would have gone to the - much less accessible - main gate, and had to cross the entire campus."
6307,"The main entrance to the museum is a shallow, smooth ramp leading up to automatic double doors. The lift is to the left of the entrance, and is large enough to allow multiple prams and wheelchairs in at once. There are doors on both sides of the lift, so in some cases you may not even need to reverse out of the lift. All of the floors have level access and are spacious, and exhibits are displayed at a height clearly visible from a wheelchair. The café is similarly accessible, with room to manoeuvre between tables, flexible seating arrangements, and a low counter to place your order, with automated double doors as the exit. The gift shop can be tight to move around."
6308,"There are an accessible loo and it is easy to find, there are enough space to maneouvre, it has grab rails, there are space for a carer; and the toilet is very clean and tidy."
6309,"Easy to get in and close to the disabled parking bays in the nearby car park. Bright, light and airy."
6310,"The accessible toilets in the main reception/shop were very poor as they were difficult to negotiate to get in, then once there, I was unable to get my chair in. The accessible toilet in the restaurant was adequate."
6311,The main area is all on ground floor level with ramps in place. As it is a central pub / restaurant it can be busy with people. The chairs and tables can be moved to create space.
6312,There is a big step up into the shop. There is no ramp or other device to allow a wheelchair user to enter the shop. I was unable to get into the shop. Zero stars. 
6313,Parking is fine but very tricky if arriving by any other means. Eg we arrived by train and to enter you either need to go in through a hole in the fence -(including off roading over a verge) OR you need to go in on the road behind  car!!
6314,"This is a well run chapel and music venue. There are numerous staff willing to get a ramp out sp I can get in. The staff will reserve you a good seat once you've notified them of your booking. It's a beautiful venue. Everything's sounds great. There is enough room for me to get around which is surprising given its an intimate, small place. Some wheelchair users may struggle getting into the toilets. Parking neither hard nor easy - you are reliant on luck but if you leave enough time you should be fine. Also, it must be possible to get there via public transport as Islington is a busy place."
6315,"Most supermarkets have reasonable disabled loos but this one was particularly good, The disabled loos had loads of space to get in and good facilities inside. In addition - and I haven't seen this before - in the general ladies loos section, one of the three cubicles had grip rails on the walls on either side of the loo itself and a large easy grip handle on both sides of the cubicle door.  Really usful for someone with some mobility issues but who doesn't feel the need to use the disabled loo.
The toilets were all sparkling clean. Well done Morrisons."
6316,"There is a disabled space for 1 car beside museum. Behind the museum is North St car park and also West St car park, both of which are easy to access from museum."
6317,High step at front door but staff rushed to help me lift the scooter inside. Lots of room to move about inside and everything is on one level.
6318,All staff were extremely polite and helpful.   I paid  a Concessionary entrance rate and my carer went in free of charge. The entrance ticket is valid for a full year.
6319,Plenty of disabled parking. As far as I am aware - there is no public transport to the site.There is parking for coaches as well as cars.
6320,Plenty  of disabled spaces near doors.
6321,Blue badge parking a short walk from the walk around section was fine - smooth flat surface to get out. I don't recall hash lines to the rear of my car for safe rear entrance/exit.
6322,Very good
6323,"Parking isn't great. Nearest car park is Grove Street which doesn't have any decent accessible bays. The only bay was one slightly larger, painted in white with no marked out areas with word disabled in it. The car park, like all Derby council owned car parks, isn't free for the disabled unless you're on high rate mobility DLA (not PIP) and have a permit. 

The pavements are terrible at minute too as the council are doing road works so large areas are blocked off. "
6324,"I found it impossible to access the toilet without assistance from an able bodied person. 

There are two doors - one into the toilet 'corridor' opens in. The accessible loo door opens out. When they're both open, they prevent anyone getting in or out of the toilet corridor! I needed my husband to open the toilet door (I knocked to show I was done) as otherwise I could have hit someone with it.

Its not possible to wash and dry your hands while sat on the toilet as the drying facilities are out of reach."
6325,"The Glen Nevis self-catering park is an easy drive from Fort William, and you can park by your caravan. There are buses too, with stops outside the park, but I didn't test their accessibility."
6326,"The toilet was reasonable for an outdoor venue. There was an emergency cord but I don't know how long it would be before anyone responded as this site covers a large area and the visitor centre is not manned, although there is a chidren's nursery next door.  You need a Radar key to access it."
6327,It's 4 only because the whole tour is not possible.
6328,"A must if you are interested in 20th century art and design, especially the work of Piet Mondrian and the de Stijl group. The building is fully accessible, though once you are past the foyer there are heavy doors to contend with. There's free admission for accompanists. Some attendants were quick to help, but we had to rely on the Accompanist's well-established technique of backing through doors and hauling Wheelchair Girl after him - that's the only reason this venue doesn't get five stars. It's worth checking out the website, as they have a variety of temporary displays. We enjoyed seeing some very whacky ceramics. The museum does not open on Mondays."
6329,"Carpark A is closest to the hotel, there as blue badge parking places on most floors and even if you cannot use a blue badge, the non bb parking spaces are very close. Parking is not a problem. Public transport is within a few yards of the hotel and being Olympic Park developed, is disability friendly."
6330,"(See pictures attached) Little ramp and a door to get into where the loos are, I needed help holding the door as it’s hard to open while going up the slope in a manual chair. Disabled loo is unlocked (no radar key needed) and the door is very light. Nicely tiled disabled toilet / baby changing room. Not huge but a decent size. Just a basic disabled loo so no adult changing. Plenty of rails and a full length mirror on the door. Red emergency cord hangs all the way to the ground but with the lock (see pics) not sure if someone would be able to get in from the outside in an emergency, though there might be a way - I didn’t ask."
6331,The outlet had a specific 'blue badge' parking area. But finding a space within the other car parks can be difficult especially during peak times as the car parks can become very busy.
6332,Lots of wide spaces directly outside the main building entrance - no roads to cross...
6333,The guy who took us down in the lift after viewing the crown jewels was very helpful and gave us advice on how to access the Great Hall and the Tea Room. The other staff were friendly but not very helpful or proactive in helping us to understand where the wheelchair friendly places were. 
6334,"Everything that my daughter who is paralysed and in a wheelchair needed,  was available free of charge.  For her it was just like being in her own home.  The lodges are modern, comfortable and very clean.  I just wish there were more lodges like this in Scotland.  The views over the golf course are stunning.  The patio with table and chairs enabled us to sit outside and enjoy the fabulous weather!!  Lots of lovely villages to visit although some places are difficult to access if you are in a wheelchair.   Although all the equipment, wet room etc are second to none, she did feel that the kitchen sink/cooker would be difficult for her to access if she didn't have help."
6335,"Nice and spacious, but no red emergency cord. There is a grab rail, however. Certainly enough space to fit a wheelchair in. "
6336," The staff is very friendly and helpful. As we bought our tickets, they told us extra information on accessibility and how to get to other museums and sites in the area. Also, people with mobility disability get in free. "
6337,Number of parking spaces available on campus . Pre booking essential
6338,My husband and I parked in the car park opposite but there are spaces outside the theatre. You may have to contact the theatre regarding these.
6339,"Small, 11 roomed, traditional, sea front guest house in Dawlish, Devon. Close to the railway station. Some rooms have sea views and a few have balconies. The Blenheim offers bed and breakfast or self catering accommodation, as each studio is equipped with kitchen facilities. There are two ground floor rooms accessible from street level by 4 steps, with grab rails, which will be suitable for some people with mobility disabilities."
6340,"Parking is charged, even for Blue Badge Holders. There are some places you can park for free but are a short distance away and one is controlled by cameras and is for a limited time."
6341,"Built with disabled in mind, with all necessary space and facilities at required heights etc."
6342,"Very good, roomy"
6343,"I don't know about parking, but this branch is not far from Waterloo Station and Southwark Station, both of which are step-free on the Jubilee Line. Beware at Waterloo: the Jubilee Line lift is flakey, and is often out of service. Check before you travel!"
6344,"Overall, Tesco Maryhill has great wheelchair accessibility with lifts up into the store, very helpful staff ready to assist if you need any help, i learned that there is a sign language course that some members of staff have completed and they now know basic sign language, there are hearing aid implants where necessary and they have 3 disabled toilets at hand and finally they allow guide dogs in-store. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is when busy the aisles can be very hard to manoeuvre through as they are quite narrow. "
6345,"The house is a great place for the senses - you touch and feel objects, try on hats and costumes, and even taste food in the incredible kitchen. It's quite a serene house, and very quiet as you walk around. Signage is good if you're looking for toilets etc., but it's a little more confusing if you're unaware where the exhibits are. Do follow the sign to the kitchen, it does mean the old kitchen and not the modern day kitchen where afternoon teas are prepared! 

Being such an old house, its grand staircase is one of its features. There are more old staircases throughout, but they have wide steps and good handrails. There is a lift, but it does look on the smaller side. There is a step at the front entrance, but there is a member of staff inside at the shop who can place down a temporary ramp."
6346,They are not staff they are extended family and nothing is too much trouble
6347,"There is one customer toilet. It's wheelchair-accessible and well designed, but staff have thoughtlessly put a large waste-bin in the wheelchair transfer area. They do not understand that this area is NOT free space but is required by a wheelchair user for parking when transferring to the toilet. Toilet paper is not replenished frequently enough."
6348,"Space to side of caravan.
Did not use public transport"
6349,"If you aren't driving to the store, there is a large walkway down the car park that leads you down to the main street where there are very easily accessible bus stops, the walkway is very wide and flat making it very friendly towards people who need the space and need adaptable technologies eg wheelchairs or walking aids.
in addition to this there are multiple disabled parking spaces close the the shop entrance."
6350,We took an accessible cab to and from the airport and MRT in between. Cab cost is S$50 per trip regardless of distance. MRT is fabulous and population extremely helpful.
6351,"There are a number of Blue badges spaces available in the car park next to the main gate and in the car park opposite the park. Coatbridge Central Station is at the bottom of the road. 
While you can see the Museum from Coatbridge Sunnyside Station it is a long walk round via the town centre 
The nearest bus service are from Coatbridge Fountain area this is around 10mins walk away from here you can get local buses plus services across Lanarkshire and into Glasgow."
6352,"None of the toilets seemed to be particularly attractive!

There is a door from the cafe area then a fairly narrow short corridor to the toilets. 

The accessible toilet is not very large to start with, and the position of the toilet and sink mean it could be quite difficult for some people (especially if require carers).

Unfortunately it had been felt necessary to store a very large bin in the bathroom, meaning the toilet was inaccessible.

There was a red cord, but this did not reach the toilet. It was also made more inaccessible by the bin being there.

The toilet is also the baby change area. "
6353,"Staff seemed okay, although not massively friendly or helpful. "
6354,"Good level access, with no steps."
6355,The flooring is flat and a little stairway has a slope next to it for wheelchairs/scooters and those that can't walk too easily. There is a lift near to the escalator in case the escalator is difficult to use. 
6356,All the staff were very accommodating helpful & friendly.
6357,Several accessible toilets.
6358,Some on street parking in Castle Street if you can find a space or theres the Castle Street car park. Lots of buses go up Lothian Road.
6359,"Fantastic access - Courts 1 and 2 particularly, more so than Centre Court for sightlines. Would absolutely recommend it. "
6360,"It's easy enough to get into the shop, if you can open doors for yourself, and easy to get around the ground floor. The step-free entrance is on the Trinity Street side of the shop.

The lift to the first floor is old, cramped and unreliable. The interior metal concertina-style doors frequently get stuck which blocks access into/out of the lift, and staff - who are aware of this long-standing problem but have not bothered to get it fixed - have to bash and kick the doors to free them. Very inconvenient and disagreeable, and it was also disagreeable that the otherwise totally charming staff find it amusing that the lift is so temperamental.

On the first floor there is a raised mezzanine area which does not have step-free access, but the very sweet staff are happy to fetch any books you'd like to look at if you can't access that area. Nevertheless, it is impossible to browse there if you can't get there, so that's only a partial mitigation of the lack of access to that area. "
6361,"This performance was part of the Findhorn Bay Arts Source to Sea programme.  This performance by Oceanallover  entitled 'Ecdysis (in vivo) featured dance, amazing costumes, singing and rap; it was set outdoors in woods.  The performance itself was brilliant and I really enjoyed it; I loved the way that it portrayed the sense of renewal and emergence all very relevant to our world today.  I loved the fusion of electronic, rap and brass music and the costumes and dancer were incredibly beautiful; the singing ethereal and haunting.  The only disappointment was that when I tried to book this event initially, the website stated that it was ' not suitable for wheels of any kind' (see below)."
6362,"Staff were great.  While you cant get to the bar upstairs as a wheelchair user, they will bring drinks down to you at the seating area beside the 'hatch in the wall' which sells snacks."
6363,"Straight access in to the restaurant.  There are no steps to negotiate. Plenty of space around the tables.  Very suitable for anyone with mobility issues or sight issues as there is good space round every table to allow easy movement.  Good, airy and light place."
6364,"All one on level, easy parking, good bus links, accessible toilets, and Shopmobility."
6365,"There is a train station (Dalmeny) which is approx. a 10 minute walk away - it is down hill to the Creative Café, but might not be such an easy walk/push going back up it!

We travelled by car. There is a small parking area just outside the Creative Café (unmarked gravel area), but there is a larger car-park just before you reach the Café, which has several marked disabled bays. 

There are some narrow and cobbled roads as you come through South Queensferry, so it is a little more bumpy for a few minutes. It is a popular place with tourists, so the streets can be fairly busy, but everyone seemed quite accommodating of each other.
"
6366,"It has level access, lovely staff and supports young people with learning difficulties."
6367,There are many staff and they are all very helpful and friendly.
6368,Good car park space. All tarmac . Limited blue badge spaces close to entrance but plenty of parking overall.
6369,"Again, excellent."
6370,Steps to the entrance and need to use a slope to a fire exit if using a wheelchair.
6371,"I couldn't find the accessible loo at first - it was not signed.
It was clean & tidy & there was enough space to manoeuvre."
6372,"The red entrance gates were wide open and access was step free from the street. There is a short paved path and then a wooden bridge, which has a slight curve but it is not steep. At the end of the bridge is a low, wooden gate which is on wheels. It was slightly ajar and I found it quite easy to move. See photos.

There are different types of paths around the garden, some are made up of mosaic tiles, other parts are paved but the majority are firm earth paths. One of the paths that circles the garden ends with 4 steps, without a handrail outside the main building. I found the top step was slightly higher than the others. I was told by staff that there was previously a handrail there but when it became unsteady it was not replaced. Some people with mobility impairments will need to retrace their steps to get to the main building or to exit the garden. 

There is seating scattered throughout the garden. Most is bench seating with back support but there are some picnic tables and benches. There is also some movable seats and tables on the terrace directly in front of the main building. In the community garden there are a number of raised flower beds."
6373,"A member of staff has to be summoned to put the folding ramp in place,  so because you are not TOTALLY independent, not quite 5 stars! The staff however are always willing and very happy to help.  (am I being too fussy?!)"
6374,"We arrived in Cardiff by train, there is a train station next to the hotel although you need to walk around the block (250 yds approx) to the disabled access entrance. There was on street parking outside the hotel although we didn't use it. As the hotel is in the city centre, accessible public transport is good. There is also a dedicated mobility assistance vehicle which you can book or flag down."
6375,Automatic entrance door.  Flat everywhere.  Lift.  Seating in every gallery.  Spacious everywhere.  Signage clear.
6376,"There was signage available to help but difficult to see in large crowds. A lot of problems were due to large amounts of people. The only place to sit if you wanted a rest would be in a park, restaurant or cafe, thus being inconvenient and sometimes difficult to find. Again, seating spaces would often be already taken."
6377,The staff were pleasant if a little uninterested . There was no housekeeping staff for the entire 4 day Christmas period. There was no food available at all except breakfast  and they were obviously running on a skeleton staff.
6378,"As I was staying close by we just walked [wheeled] to the place. Market Street is very busy and parking is limited. There are bus stops close by.
"
6379,"A level entrance with wide automatic doors
 The circulating spaces are good, though the loo shares a corridor with a computer and music synthesizer area, so users need to be careful when coming out - the door swings outwards and you might hit some budding composer or techno-geek."
6380,Wheelchair accessible venue hosting a range of organisations
6381,"When I booked I made the assumption that it would be alright as it has a lift. When I arrived at the hotel there were about 8 stairs with a handrail on the right hand side only, which was the only way to get into the hotel. Once you have got up these stairs there is a small lift to the bedrooms. The breakfast room was only accessible by a small flight of stairs so I didn't use this facility. On leaving the lift there were no further steps to my bedroom. The roof terrace was accessible by lift and a few stairs with a handrail."
6382,There are no accessible toilets on site but there are accessible toilets on the lower levels of the adjacent car park. It can be a bit of a climb down and back up the ramps.
6383,"Awesome!

They especially enjoyed building a water slide and involving everyone in the ensuing mayhem!"
6384,Toilets are located in the St. Enoch Shopping center. The all clean with plenty of space for career. The toilets also lock and unlock without much effort. Clean and well stocked with toilet roll.
6385,"Not sure what too expect when we visited we were delighted to discover such an amazing place and space! Anywhere that fulfills some basic needs like a Changing Places Loo, good parking and easy access makes for a great visit. Then add in to the mix some fascinating galleries, the library, a great cafe and a fun maze and you get my five stars!"
6386,Good access from side door with ramp leading to bar area.
6387,"Restaurant - level access through back door.
No sign to say about steep dip.   Downstairs is quite cramped.
Staff very good & prepared to read menu for you.
Only toilet is up steep stairs."
6388,The staff in all the shops that he visited it were very very friendly and more than willing to help to move things or bring things to me if I was unable to access them. All the shopkeepers and shop assistants were very Covid compliant and all of that hand sanitiser on entry to their shops and advised people of the rules around wearing masks. I have to admit that this made my first trip out a more positive and reassuring one for me as a disabled person.
6389,"Visited several times. Transferred last years holiday to 2021 due to covid but looking forward to returning in July. Site fully accessible, great accessible caravans, good staff who are disabled aware. Clubhouse good and level, good toilet facilities. Great family place right in the heart of beautiful Weymouth"
6390,"Yorkshire Wildlife Park is an outdoor animal attraction great for all ages. The Park is home to many animals; which have large enclosures surrounded by paths offering an accessible view for all. The Lemur’s and wallaby’s enclosure is a walk through attraction, were the keepers give an informative talk about the animals at selected times. The park offers a multi-sensory experience by enabling the wallaby’s to be stroked. The park is accessible to all and has many facilities across the park."
6391,Helpful and friendly.
6392,The signage is great.  There are two push button operated doors designed for people with disabilities.  There is a lift as well as an escalator to take ppl to the main floor &/or the 2nd floor (in order to access the rear of the screens)
6393,Mermaid Quay toilets tucked away on first floor but lift access available.  Most of the restaurants have accessible toilets.
6394,The good thing about the disabled parking is it's right outside the excellent assisted loo. However it's at the end of the car park furthest from the start of the trails and there's only two spaces. However there was plenty of room in the car park and it was quite level (though a slope  down from the loos to the main car park).
6395,"Generally accessible. Staff training needed in the placement of stock - without this, the score would be higher


"
6396,"The venue is a huge 800 acre park, so distances are to be expected. By road, there is a 0.8 mile access road, predominantly single track with passing places to access a car park  (admission to venue is paid to the car park attendant). Parking was compacted gravel with no marked bays, and no areas specifically marked out for disabled use. 

There is a secondary parking area exclusive for disabled people near the castle, this has room for two cars, but requires the user to open up two gates manually. 

The nearest bus stop is 1 mile from the main entrance, and has four buses a day (Monday to Saturday)"
6397,See previous comments
6398,"The Big Red Barn was a great find and I should have stopped there sooner.   It is one of the few and perhaps the only really accessible restaurant between Abington (M74) and Edinburgh.
There is a very small lip to negotiate at the door.   Inside is bright and clean with plenty of room between tables.
The Big Red Barn is well worth an visit if you are traveling along the A702 between Abington and Edinburgh - 5 miles east of Biggar"
6399,The store has an open level access entrance. There's plenty of space to get around to see the various toys on display.
6400,"The chapel is tucked away in Pearson Square, a pedestrianised area with no vehicle access. The chapel is surrounded by tall modern buildings, so you could easily miss it unless you knew it was there. There are a number of pedestrianised paths leading into the square from surrounding streets.

It is very close to Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road. The nearest accessible tube is Tottenham Court Road. Also nearby is Goodge Street, Warren Street and Oxford Circus tube station, which are not step free. There are several buses that go along Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, that stop nearby.

I found the easiest way to find it was to get a bus to Goodge Street tube station, which is on Tottenham Court Road, and then walk along Goodge Street itself. It's a level 5 minute walk to the chapel from here. Walk on the north side of the street and after you cross Cleveland Street, you will find on your right hand side, a pedestrianised path which is the entrance to Pearson Square. Sorry I forgot to take a photo of this. The chapel is in the middle of the square."
6401,The toilet block on the course isn't strictly disabled access but could be used. But the proper disabled toilets are a two minute drive from here at the West Sands.
6402,"Staff were really helpful, and understanding. The radiography staff in particular , and the lady at reception who booked me in. I sat waiting for a taxi just inside the door , due to the cold, and several staff stopped in the passing to ensure my well-being "
6403,Very helpful and will always remove two seats for you do you have loads of room.
