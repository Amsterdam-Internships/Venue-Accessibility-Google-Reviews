0,"Friendly and efficient service. I have used this bus company about 4 times and have always found them to be efficient and trustworthy, i would highly recommend them."
1,"The entrance and exit doors are separate both consist of a two sets of double doors these are automatic. There is a short gap between the doors. 
On the way in to the store there is a push style barrier this is like a gate it does move out of the way if you push but it might be a bit of a problem for someone using two arm crutches or walking sticks"
2,"Staff at the way in knew I was disabled but didn't volunteer any information about parking, loos or accessible trails. I had to ask for a map."
3,All level areas that I need to go to
4,Lothian buses stop a few minutes away. Parking is available underground.
5,Easy level access throughout. No steps anywhere.   Lift available to the upper floors but we were lucky enough to get the ground floor.
6,"We booked assistance at Reading train station for the 11.50am train
and were told to arrive at least 20 minutes before departure.
Never a family to be late, 
we parked in the disabled parking space at Reading train station 
and had bought our tickets by 11.10am.

We spoke to the man at the barrier and he let us through and said he'd radio for assistance.
We knew we were early and so expected to wait
but only had to wait about 5 minutes and were apologised to several times for that.
We found amazing sign about the station for visually impaired.

The guy who came to assist was friendly and energetic,
he made the whole experience relaxing and fun
and I didn't feel a burden in any way.

He saw that our train was delayed and got us to an earlier train.
This was great, but that train was really busy and we were last on,
having to wait until everyone had cleared space for the ramp to be placed.

The assistance guy was brilliant, he shouted for people to let us on."
7,Staff are generally helpful
8,One one level lots of space automatic opening doors would improve it.
9,The access to get on the tram was very easy for me as a pressed a button at the side of my carriage and the ramp automatically came down.
10,See above
11,On street parking but there is access via ramp
12,You can access the pub from the side entrance and there is a bar and a disabled toilet that everyone can access. 
13,"As always the staff are faultless. helpful, knowledgabe and professional and they are keen to make sure everyone gets to see as much as possible."
14,Access to and around the station was good. The help from the information desk and in boarding the train was seamless.
15,Got here by taxi and home by bus - both worked very well.
16,Super helpful - you can tell they've had some great staff training... Very helpful and seemed genuinely pleased to greet visitors and show us around.
17,"There is a ramp into main entrance. Reception desk has a lowered section and there is a wider barrier for wheelchairs. 

There was mesh on the grass too which would aid in wheelchair access.
 
Hearing loop signs were also spotted. I didn't see any braille signs. 

They have sunflower lanyards for those with invisible disabilities."
18,There is some but not easy to spot 
19,"This is a fabulous park and has wonderful smooth, wide paths.  The site is virtually flat and should provide a great 'walk' for wheelchair users.  There's great facilities - disabled toilets at two locations, two cafes, the Kelpies, a fantastic kids play area which now includes a section for disabled children and the lake.  

Sadly there are rookie mistakes which make it just that much harder for disabled people or their carers. 

1.  There are not enough disabled spaces.  The nearest disabled parking to the children's play area is more than 300m away.  It has three disabled spaces.  It also has a gravel surface which is very hard work in a wheelchair.  Needs to be more disabled parking, close to the play area.

2.  The paths smooth, wide, but are cambered to make nice sweeping curves for cyclists.  I am sure they are fantastic on a bike.  Unfortunately this makes them much harder work with a wheelchair."
20,All the staff we encountered were great! Really helpful and Knew details about the menu when asked.
21,"What a fantastic morning spent on the beach, the venue is all set up to hoist you into the Beach wheelchair from your own chair. the Beach wheelchair can be self operated or depending on your level of disability you can be driven by your carer if required. I found the welcome from the young lady at the Beach hut to be, very warm and she put any fears or trepidation that I may have had at rest straight away. the experience was like driving my car once again after having to stop driving only 3 years ago, when I was unable to get in and out of my car. "
22,"This is a branch of the national chain, but lots of care is taken to help diners with special requirements. The staff are very friendly.
There are disabled toilets on the ground floor, a ramp to the front door, and plenty of room to negotiate if you use a chair or scooter.
For those with special dietary requirements there are separate versions of the menu for vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free dishes.
You can book in advance by phone or online if you prefer. Staff are always happy to help you find the most suitable table."
23,"An amusement park and pleasure gardens in Copenhagen's city centre. Originally opened in 1843. There are fairground rides, theatre, parades, amusements, aquarium, a wide range of places to eat and gift shops. In the evening the park is beautifully illuminated."
24,"Getting to the Taynish car park in a car: at Tayvallich village hall(you go past the Tayvallich village shop, past the church) there is a fork in the road, you take the left side road sign posted 'Taynish' and follow the road. The road to the Taynish car park is quite bumpy! The is one disabled parking spot and approximately 5 other parking spots there too but it isn't a marked car park, so could possibly fit a couple more cars. The car park doesn't get too busy.
There is a path leading all the way to the old Taynish mill(400m from the car park) which my power chair has no issues. There is also a board walk off to the left of the path, not too far from the start; it goes right over a little freshwater loch(Lochan Taynish) and no issues in my wheelchair. If you go back to the main path and carry on, the path starts to wind downwards towards the mill, the slight gradiant downwards caused no issues. There is a grass area right next to the mill, so a lovely spot to have a picnic/lunch. There are a couple of wooden benches(these are relatively new/been replaced) with attached seating and there are spaces where the seating stops specifically  to accommodate a wheelchair. I can go in to the mill to look around in my wheelchair and also across the little bridge to look at the waterfall on the other side of the mill.
From the grass area the path carries on to the shore, no problems in my wheelchair. There is a little stone built seat with a Wordsworth quote carved into the stone seat and a wooden box attached available to write your thoughts/poems/pictures. I can't actually get on to the shore but it's a lovely spot to watch boats and wildlife and have a cuppa (brought my own flask). It would be an issue for someone with mobility issues actually getting on to the shore: there's stone steps with a burn at the bottom leading into the sea. My husband and young daughter have no issues but they don't have mobility problems. But being in a wheelchair I love to watch them even if I can't actually get on to the shore myself.
From 17th May(2019)-30th September(2019) there is an Art Trail leading to and around the Mill, an outdoor art exhibition, so keep your eyes peeled for different pieces of art dotted about! It's a short walk but there is a few (relatively new) wooden seats dotted along the walk, so anyone with mobility issues can have a rest along the way. Hope this review helps! 
"
25,Some areas are down steps and you need to go in the back entrance by the hotel as there are steps at the front.
26,Maggie and her team are great.
27,"Did not use, but one of our group said that they were fully accessible, provisioned and well serviced. There were disabled loos that had RADAR key entrance. Excellent and well directed signage."
28,"Living so long with MND I used one walking stick then two, two crutches a 4 wheel walker a scooter a manual wheelchair and now a power chair. I have had a good bit of experience when it comes to accommodation but MICs is very good for anyone in these situations. If you’re a hoist user like me you do need to ask for a shower commode chair because the hoist wouldn't get you on the toilet and the fixed shower chair. If you are tall and can still transfer the shower chair on the wall could be too low as it's a fixed height. Because I'm big and my wife is small she might have struggled with the fall on the floor to the drain that takes the water from the shower if I didn't have use in my arms and hands. 
Overall we would not look at any other place to stay in Barcelona after staying at MICs, and we will definitely be going back. "
29,No changing place toilet which is surprising for a new building but a decent disabled toilet.
30,"Very accessible entrance way. Fantastic staff. Great disabled accessible toilet. Also fully accessible outside seating area.
Food reasonably priced."
31,Use the wheelchair slope
32,We arrived by train and that was close by but the pavements in the area are in poor condition and there was not always a dropped kerb. We didn't have a car so I can't comment on parking.
33,"Car park very handy for spa and gym, just remember to REGISTER YOUR CARE"
34,nice big ramp into the main entrance
35,Toilet accessible with plenty of room for 2 people & a wheelchair also plenty of grab rails.
36,"Available on both the lower and upper levels, large and clean."
37,Very helpful. 
38,Lovely staff are really helpful and friendly.
39,so many staff to help you
40,"Wide level access. Staff saw me at the door and came over to offer help. Cleared the way to a suitable table. Order point easy to access, staff brought my purchases to the table. "
41,If only everybody you met had the understanding and enthusiasm of Watford Football Club employees - that's the dream!
42,"Great restaurant in Wakefield city centre. Fully accessible entrance with an accessible toilet inside. 

The food is fantastic and offers both ‘large plates’ - standard dishes like steak and fish - and ‘small plates’ which are more like tapas. The menu styles itself as Pacific, with food from American and Asia. Dietary requirements are catered to quite well, with plenty of gluten free options. Plenty of nice wines and cocktails on the menu. 

Overall, a great, accessible restaurant with lots of atmosphere. "
43,"There's a car park with Blue Badge spaces (chargeable unless you're a NT member), cafe and small shop with accessible loo.  There's a choice of self guided walks (free guide/map from the cafe). The ""sailors walk"" has a surfaced path, easy for wheelchairs and scooters. There are lovely views across the punchbowl. If you have more robust wheels, there are lots of paths going off in lots of directions (take the map and just watch out on some of the uneven paths, which can be tricky).  The view from Gibbet Hill is great - lots of info boards give the history of the gruesome events that took place here and gave the hill it's name."
44,There are so many animals to see and there are lots of activities for younger children. It is a fair price and  the food is great. Me and my family will definitely be going again during the summer holidays.
45,Good disabled parking facilities
46,The staff were really friendly and more than happy to help.
47,Lovely staff but hamstrung by the unsuitability of the building. Lovely morning coffee (and the waitress also found a GF biscuit for gluten intolerant husband.)
48,"The toilet was spacious and very clean.
"
49,There is a big car park. 
50,Level access throughout with good facilities.
51,"There are many bus stops nearby both on Dalry road, Morrison St & West Maitland St. There is limited parking on Morrison Street but plenty in the Dalry road area and other neighbouring streets. "
52,"Just an update from the previous review - the accessible toilet did have a broken lock, this has now been fixed. It's still cramped and full of bins, but the lock works."
53,There is a toilet just outside the store but still in the covered shopping centre.you need a radar key to get in but if you do t have yours they lend you one at customer services
54,A restaurant right in heart of Edinburgh City Centre. We went on a beautiful sunny day during the Edinburgh Festival so the Royal Mile was buzzing with excitement with thousands of people watching random performances up and down the street which gives a wonderful atmosphere.  We were a bit disappointed that the tables outside the restaurant were full but we only had a 5 minute wait for a table inside. The aisle is a little tight for a wheelchair nut we did get a table which was suitable for a wheelchair user.  The meal was very good at reasonably priced.  However the only thing that let it down was the disabled toilet. There was a designated one but the door opens in making it impossible for a wheelchair to go in AND close the door!!! Had the door opened outwards it would be have been adequate.  This is the only reason for the 2 star rating otherwise it would have been a 3.5 
55,"There are no toilets on the site but the adjacent, 100m, new library and museum building had excellent toilets including a Changing Places Toilet."
56,"My mum is in a wheelchair and this hotel was absolutely brilliant for her needs. 
The staff are lovely and so helpful, the choice of food is great and everything tasted delicious. 
The room we stayed in was perfect - shower chair in wet room, pull down toilet rail, bed rails were provided and also a zimmer frame. The room was cleaned every day and everything was spotless.
The entertainment each evening sounded brilliant, we only went along one evening but loved it!!
My dad was able to hire a motorised scooter for a day and we all enjoyed our time going along the nearby promenade. The location of the hotel is great, no busy traffic and a 5 minute walk to the beach.
There is nowhere else in Scotland that caters for people with disabilities like the Lovat Lodge Hotel and we MUST help keep this hotel going. It would be such a sad loss if this place should ever close down. I just don't think enough people are aware this hotel even exists."
57,Staff are always great! Seem genuinely friendly and periodically come over to check if you've got everything you need without being obtrusive.
58,Good ground floor council run car park on ground floor near/next to restaurent- however not accessible to large vans.
59,"We are getting the measure of changing places toilet as Clacket lane(M25) has them East Bound only and Fleet Westbound only. South Mimms also has changing places. Have a radar key

Tesco's at new Milton has a Changing Places WC and Milford on Sea are also in the process of building one( likely opening Easter 2020)"
60,No sill at all on the entrance or the exit
61,"Masham is set in attractive countryside and the brewery is an example of Yorkshire enterprise.  
Access is via an outside self operated lift.  
Good restaurant, beer available.  Shop and tour available to those without mobility issues."
62,"The walk at Callander Meadows is accessed from the big carpark on the left hand side of the main road in middle of Callander if heading towards Kilmahog. Simply follow the river round to the right and you'll be on the meadows path, a short but very accessible walk along the river. (Takes about 20mins). Some benches on route but they are few and far between once you leave the car park area. It's mainly flat, with one slope towards the end as you head  back to the car park if you want to do the full circle."
63,No hearing loop or Braille but I bet she'd get them if needed
64,"Only falls short of a 5 because you have to negotiate a couple of heavy doors to get in. Once in, the accessible toilet is 5 star."
65,Tables and TV's set at suitable height and wheelchair friendly. Button for automatic door set at unsuitable location. several door which people with some disabilities wouldn't be able to open would be easier if automatic. very wheelchair user friendly elsewhere with excellent hoist features and objects placed at suitable level for benefit of user.
66,Theres a few spaces right outside.
67,"There is level access into the restaurant and signage is noticeably outside. I would say the doors are quite difficult to get through, one is too narrow to get through in a wheelchair so both need opened. Although there are two sets right after one another so it is a struggle to open. I had two people with me so we just managed but would be better having an automatic door button and maybe only one set of doors. A wheelchair user on there own would struggle and there is no bell to press for assistance. 

We go a table right near the door so didn’t have to go too far into the restaurant, but the tables are very close together so would struggle to get around them in a wheelchair.

Tables are at a good height though for wheelchairs and if you got past a few of the tables you’d be able to manoeuvre more around.  "
68,At least for blue badge base with extra space around them
69,The most horrific toilet experience ever - but also the best safari experience ever and the dinosaurs were fantastic.
70,"Really helpful and understanding, and happy for clients either to remain in wheelchair or to transfer. And very good at their job."
71,"Whole Foods Market in Soho has a great selection of healthy snacks, drinks and meals that will leave you feeling like you've indulged, but in a wholesome way. Whilst the foods can be slightly overpriced, they are definitely worth the money! If you choose to go for one of the take away meal boxes, there's enough food to sustain you for hours, so whilst they are quite costly, they definitely provide you with plenty of food."
72,"Wheelchair friendly, walk in showers, clean and fresh linen, towels, wonderful kitchen with full cooker fridge/freezer dish washer washing machine and tumble drier. Large lawned area on the river side. The staff are ever helpful and if you require anything they will be there. There are wheelchair friendly day boats for hire  and the pub {The Ferry Inn) is only about 150mtrs away."
73,Very good car park and plenty of disabled spaces. Car park very close to the entrance.
74,We parked on St Vincent Street which was only a 2 min walk to the cafe. We were able to park for free with our blue badge.
75,Ramp access into a bar area then you had to go through there to get to the restaurant . Not a problem for me as everyone in the bar area moved & I got through easily. 
76,Helpful staff.
77,"Christmas Markets are wheelchair accessible including the Bar area. Accessibility to stalls on one side of the markets due to there being a raised step and space restrictions within the stall, however staff are friendly and very helpful to facilitate people seeing their range of products. 
It would be advised to attend the Christmas markets at quiet times for example during the week to make for a more enjoyable day out.  
The Markets are in a good location for public transport and there is a car park behind St Enochs shopping center which is also wheelchair accessible. "
78,Disabled Parking at door.   
79,"We found them, but could not get in to use them. It looked small from outside anyway, so quess it’s just a basic toilet."
80,"The pavilion has plenty of parking spots outside right by the entrance but the only downside is when everyone leaves the theatre, the people parked in the disabled spots can have difficultly getting out with all the other cars leaving."
81,Easy parking
82,"She couldn't have done any more to help us or make us feel welcome; she also let us wander about and take our time while she worked amongst the plants which made you feel even closer to nature and as if you were in a working, living garden rather than a big shop.  "
83,"To get on the Eye you purchase a ticket in advance or as we did, simply turn up. There were large queues in the ticket office so we enquired how to get accessible tickets and were directed to a separate desk. Tickets in hand we went to the wheel where we were directed a different way so we didn't have to wait too long. Two long ramps lead up to the wheel's entrance point where you wait. You will be told which pod to use and the stewards will put an access ramp down and help you board. Once in there's bags of space and the glass sides make viewing easy. the trip took around thirty minutes."
84,"100 spots, however all were taken so arrive early! (Blue badge only)."
85,"You can get to the museum by bus and car, and it also has a small train station. We got there by car. The museum is situated by a main road so it is easy to get there and there are several disabled parking spaces."
86,"Easy access coffee shop, chairs with arms and helpful staff. "
87,You can't fault the parking with a couple of good sized accessible parking bays to the rear / side of the building. If you're visiting by bus there seemed to be lots of buses buzzing by. It's also a short walk from the City Square. If coming by train it is about a twenty minute walk.
88,"I don’t think there was anywhere I couldn’t access but the area around the small children’s fair was the most difficult as it’s on loose stone .

The gardens were accessible but I suspect after a lot of rain it would be challenging as the paths are grass. But it was well worth the effort.

There is a large steam driven carousel, which has two ‘dragons’ which contain 2 bench seats and it doesn’t go up and down like the horses. The ride is up 2 steep stairs though. The attendants are very helpful and stop the ride and will assist you if you can manage the stairs. 

All 3 of the steam trains are accessible and the attendants will help you get on and off but you cannot ride in a wheelchair , you must be able to stand and walk a few steps. 

Plenty of outdoor seating for rests and picnics. 

The cafe is accessible from one end with indoor seating and a covered outdoor area with tables and chairs . There is not a huge amount of room inside for wherlchairs ."
89,"Wheelchair accessible restroom with level access, good size disabled toilet, friendly staff and good foodin the bar – what not to like. i agree fully with previous review."
90,"Bus, tram and on street parking."
91,Great - clean & spacious.
92,"There are some very spacious toilets toilets with handrails. Sadly no changing places facility that I could see,"
93,All staff were very friendly and happy to help customers navigate around the building. They informed me that they are happy to look after guide dogs behind reception while the owner swims. 
94,"The National Maritime Museum occupies a large site in Greenwich, South London, which is also the home of the Royal Observatory and the Queen's House. Access has been fairly well designed, though with variable conditions across the site."
95,Parking and transport is a bit tricky as it is a city centre garden square. You can be dropped near the entrance if required. The Square is very close to the West End of Princes Street where there are loads if transport connections.
96,On street blue badge parking is close by to the Gallery. Accessible buses pass nearby. Taxis can drop off almost at the door.
97,"The staff were excellent. Very friendly and welcoming. When I arrived they were just serving a large group but they still made time to come over, talk to me and take my order. Service was prompt."
98,I arrived by Hop On bus but plenty free parking. 
99,"There is a large multi storey car par built on to this centre and a lift is available from the car park in to the centre its self. There are Blue Badge spaces available.  
The Blackpool tram system nearest stop would be the tower this is a 5 min walk away from the centre its self."
100,"Buying tickets, the venue attempted to charge carer for admission. Only when carer challenged for alternative reasonable adjustments did the venue not charge for the carer. After paying for tickets, getting into the venue was via the exit, a manually operated gate. Some of the paths and main bridge was very tight for a wheelchair. Attraction included a ""quiz"" to be completed, but venue didn't have a large print version. Attraction was fully explored in less than one hour. "
101,There is one disabled toilet situated in the students union which has a lot of space.
102,"Dawlish Railway Station runs parallel to the sea wall walk and next to the station there is a step free access to the sea wall. The station has step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station. There are also local, step free buses that stop nearby. At the end of the walk there is Dawlish Warren Station, which has step free access but the station is unstaffed. There are also step free buses from Dawlish Warren."
103,"On street city centre parking is never too easy,  but opposite 100 bus terminus and very close to Prince's Street buses so easy from that point of view."
104,"Following the old Keswick to Penrith Railway railway line, the path weaves its way over the River Greta on original metal railway bridges. This fast-flowing river offers fantastic views and is home to herons and dippers.

The perfect surface for wheelchair users & mobility scooters etc. 10 km or 6.2 miles maximum to Threlkeld and back although the route is out and back so can be shortened at any point.

A firm favourite in the Lake District National Park Guide Miles Without Stiles, badly damaged during Storm Desmond but following a £8 million refurbishment it is reopen and more accessible than ever. 

It was busy but the path is wide enough for social distancing (some more respectful of this than others).

Please bear in mind this is a public footpath so there are no toilet facilities en-route.

https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/visiting/things-to-do/walking/mileswithoutstiles/mws37"
105,stair lift and ramp 
106,Very friendly and helpful
107,"In this centre there are various disabled friendly entrances. The shops are all easily accessed as there is no need for stairs or a lift on the ground floor.  To get to the upper floors a lift is required, and all lifts are well sign posted and easily accessed"
108,RADAR key required. Very clean and quite spacious. Handrails close to toilet on left side but there is about two feet space between the toilet and wall and handrail on right hand side. Red cord hanging to floor on left hand side. Space under sink to roll under. Toilet roll dispenser is the single tissue dispenser which I had a bit of bother with but it was at an okay level for me. There is a hand dryer next to the door.
109,Box office and general staff were courteous and helpful. The bar staff were less so - I think they were working under a lot of pressure.
110,"Very welcoming - a smile can say a thousand words if can’t speak Hebrew. On hand and very helpful, especially through security."
111,"We could park right outside the cottage. Not sure how close the bus comes to this site, but there's a long drive from the road to the cottage in any case. The parking area is level and smooth."
112,It was clean and tidy and easy to find. BUT it's a tight squeeze in a manual chair and took some effort to get out successfully. I'd be worried about the turning circle in a power chair but could not find an alternative. 
113,"Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful, but the staff did not know the rule about carers not having to pay for tour tickets, and although they told me there was an accessible toilet in the Learning Centre, they did not tell me that if I needed to use it after 4pm, which is when the Learning Centre closes, I would have to seek out someone with a key to let me in - giving the impression, therefore, that the accessible toilet is simply unavailable after 4pm. 

All this results an overall rating of two stars for staff - but five stars for Ann, our tour guide. "
114,always very friendly and making jokes. But any trouble you know that you're in safe hands.
115,"There were lifts, but nothing really designed for deaf people, like loops, or anyone who BSL."
116,They have made a real effort to make this as accessible as they possible can. We had no problems at all with the access.
117,Very helpful and friendly staff.
118,"Well designed ramp. Spacious doorways. Good circulation space. Lift to All floors. Accessible rooms generous on space. There was a very helpful map provided in the room showing places of interest, local supermarket and eateries. "
119,Ok once you're up in the restaurant.  While a platform lift is better than nothing its not ideal.
120,very friendly and helpful to all customers
121,"Temple Place is near Temple tube, though this has lots of steps. Bus access is easier but means a bit more walking ."
122,Extremely professional and caring staff
123,Level access and flat to move around the  garden centre. Nice place to have coffee and delicious cake.
124,"The Restaurant has its own parking area it is well laid out and has a height restriction to stop large vans using this area. There are no Blue Badge spaces in the car park. 
From the exit of the car park to the door is around 25 meters approx. 
The area from the car park along is level"
125,"Amazing, super friendly and nice, recognise repeat and loyal customers."
126,All on one level but door was heavy to open as you go in.
127,"A large car park to the side of the building with plenty of parking and disabled bays are marked.It is about 30 minutes from Doncaster train station by foot,it is also on a bus route but not to sure which one."
128,"Nice and big, only quibble was red cord wasn't hanging freely."
129,"So helpful and welcoming without being intrusive. Went to fetch menu, moved chairs for me, etc. really made me feel welcome."
130,Flat from street and inside. 
131,"Spacious and very well-equipped, with a wide door. Easy to get to from the dining areas."
132,There was room for a wheelchair to manoeuvre and a carer to assist. There were adequate grab rails.
133,"There is an accessible loo at the rear of the cafe which is easily visible. There is a slight incline to the door of the loo, but I managed it fine in my manual wheelchair. "
134,Definitely 5*. Genuinely friendly and helpful when required.
135,"You can park on street in Kings Stables Road. Then you have a fair distance to walk to get into the park, around 500 metres. If you come by public transport you can arrive from the Princes Street side of the park but beware of the very steep slopes you have to descend to get in. These ramp like slopes are not suitable for wheelchairs users. You'd need a rope, climbing gear and some sherpas to get down it!"
136,Toilet was great with all rails and free red cord but I couldn't get the sliding door to fully close or lock. I mentioned it to staff and they went off to check it while we were leaving.
137,"The Rio is an independent, 2 screen cinema in Dalston, East London. It screens mainstream and art house films.  "
138,"Staff are incredibly friendly and will go out of their way to help. They actively look for people that need assistance and seem to genuinely want to help, rather than doing it because they are being paid to"
139,"This theatre produces and hosts excellent productions, so it's great that it is also welcoming and inclusive.  Open flat access to the foyer, box office, stalls, and cafe, with (one) disabled loo.  However, there is no access to the first or second floor for wheelchair users (or people who have difficulty with stairs), so any talks or related events are usually inaccessible.  (Uncertain about provision and support for visual and audio impairment.)"
140,"The Medicne Garden is a tranquil restored Victoran Walled Garden with 2 cafes, a couple of eclectic shops and a pamper room (not accessible). In the summer it is a real sun trap and has an accessible decked cafe with a glass screen to protect you from the wind. There is also a greenhouse cafe in the rear which has a ramp (on request). 3 BlueBadge parking spaces and an accessible toilet. The car park ground is rough as are the paythways and gravel by the rear glasshouse  cafe. It is, however somewhere different to go on a dry  day and make a change from accessible garden centres and pubs to meet friends."
141,Staff were really helpful and happy to get things from the higher shelves as well as explaining the different flavours of rock and our other questions.
142,Ramped down to the cafe the shop and accessible toilet.  Can get very busy in the cafe area so can be a bit tight seating
143,Parking at front is good with a paved area for wheelchairs and path to rear of property
144,The roof doesn't quiet reach over wheelchair spots in East Stand. Probably only wheelchair spots in West Stand are covered.
145,Nice wide step free entrance!
146,It's possible to park almost outside with a short walk to the door if you're a blue badge holder. Accessible buses serve the hospital campus and they're currently some distance away as you have to walk through the hospital.
147,Button to use hoist not working.  Reported.  Contacted council again today 2 February 2022 to check to see if it was working so avoid a wasted trip.  Was passed from pillar to post as people unsure as to who was responsible.  Have an email contact who copied me in asking if this was working.  
148,"I'll start by saying that Spark is a literal stack of shipping containers that they've somehow managed to make fully accessible. Gentrification at it's finest.
The end facing the city centre (north, I think) is the accessible end. There is a slight bump to get onto the patio, which smoothly inclines into the area itself. It has one of those curtains made of plastic strips, but one end is left clear (which I only noticed after struggling through the strands of plastic). Once inside, all of the various stall are accessible from a wheelchair. Some of the counters are slightly high in places.
Unbelievably, there is lift access to the top floor. Sadly the ramp to get on the bottom of the lift is  way too steep for comfort & not for the faint of heart, but once you're up it's fine. It being a platform lift it did rather comically get stuck at the top. Staff were extremely responsive & got me back down within minutes, & were lovely about it all the while I quietly died with embarrassment.  The staff attitude more than made up for the accessibility concerns."
149,Access is on the level with no need to access stairs of any sort.Aisles are wide so access to the garden centre and restaurant is good.
150,Easy access with ramp and electric doors. Lots for sale on shop floor but could still get around on my scooter. Signs for toilets clear.
151,"Lift undergoing maintenance. We were directed to cafe outside in plants area. This was closed. Not surprised as it was extremely cold.  When we complained check out girl said we could sit outside and they would bring our order.  Myself in wheelchair and my parents 75+'didn't want to sit outside. 
Excuse me, I don't think this would have been acceptable to anyone in January."
152,Can't comment on the parking. Spittelau U-bahn station (fully accessible) is next door. A short rode on U-bahn Line 4 from the centre of Vienna.
153,Polite when booking in but they were unobservant or perhaps too busy and did not once offer any help.
154,There is no disabled parking that I saw but there are lot's of bus stops nearby that cover the major routes. Waverley train station is very close.
155,There is a disabled toilet downstairs but it isn't fully equipped with a hoist etc. and the door is quite heavy. It's also a bit small for big chairs.
156,"Can't comment on the parking. The nearest S-bahn & U-bahn stations are at Potsdam Platz, & are accessible. They are about 10 minutes' wheel/walk away with busy roads to cross. Buses 200 and M41 stop outside the Philharmonie but are very crowded on concert nights. Buses M29 and M48 stop at Potsdamer Brücke which is about five minutes level wheel/walk from the Philharmonie."
157,"The square overlooks Playa Martianez and has lovely sea views. There is also a bust of Agatha Christie, who visited the town in 1927 and the view from here is said to have inspired her Mr Quin story, The Man from the Sea."
158,"There are two accessible toilets I know of - one near platform 1, and one up near the first class lounge. Both are spacious enough, and both have red cords. There could always be more space, hence the 4-star review. I don't know if there's a changing places toilet on site. "
159,Did not use the toilets on this occasion but did not see any signs for a disabled toilet so unsure if it is just ladies & gents?
160,"Ramps, toilets "
161,"Good sized en suite accessible bathroom for the room, with good rails for the loo - but like the other two places we stayed in Ireland, strangely lacking in a drop-down rail to the left of the shower seat. Worth seeking out the large fragrant secret disabled loo tucked away on the ground floor near the breakfast room."
162,"A handy city centre hotel , lovely staff, a few minor issues if you're a wheelchair user"
163,Good space and grab rails round the loo. Not sure whether side transfer is feasible - we couldn't work out whether/how the baby changing bench (which is close to the loo) folds up. The washbasin is approachable and there's the usual Ditch round the room at skirting board level alarm cord.
164,"This station was part of my journey from Waterloo to Paddington. You can watch my entire journey on my youtube channel.   Briefly, the staff were great but there was a something missing element of assumption my wheels were the same size as a wheelchair and wouldn't get stuck; but there was no way I would test it in a live situation and get stuck.  A ramp was eventually deployed but at Paddington no ramp!"
165,"Restaurant/cafe on on level with tables outside also. Accessible toilet, access onto boat for wheel is good for wheelchair users.  "
166,"The theatre has a good level foyer and a lift to all floors. There are wheelchair spaces on all 3 levels. The two in the stalls are excellent, the ones in the Circle are adequate.  If the show has not sold well you find yourself somewhat separate from other audience members so lacking in atmosphere. The spaces on the upper circle are to be avoided.  The view is limited and one feels very much a second class citizen tucked into the least welcoming corner of the theatre and the price for all wheelchair spaces is the same, generous in the stalls but exorbitant in the upper circle! Rating 3"
167,"Clear signage as you enter the carpark as to where disabled access and motability customers entrance is.
Flat even surfaces throughout, and automatic doors
Plenty of seating "
168,Very spacious toilets and very clean.
169,"Disabled parking is limited. The bays available are just basic bays, they do not have marked out sections. The bay is just slightly wider, says disabled and in white paint. "
170,Directly beside the main road. Disabled parking close to the entry office. Entry is free to everyone. Mainline train station at Kingussie is three miles from the venue. Main line Bus service close by.
171,"There is an accessible toilet, forgot to take pic but will update next visit. "
172,"A four star, sea front hotel offering accommodation, restaurant and bar, to a high standard. There is excellent access on the ground floor/ restaurant and lift but be careful what room you choose."
173,A wheelchair accessible toilet is located inside the restaurant.
174,Very helpful and for me it made such a difference having table service and not having to juggle with a tray. 
175,"The loo is fully accessible, lots of space, with grab rails and space for a carer.
Very clean and a hoist is available to use for changing."
176,The staff themselves are very kind and supportive and would be willing to help even though the facility reduces access to most disabled clients.
177,Blue badge parking close to the Centre (about 50 yards). You could drop off even closer.
178,"I had occasion to attend the new Theatre Royal, Glasgow and was deeply impressed at the attention given to accessible services. The accessible seating was roomy, comfortable and had a clear view of the stage. I had room for my carer and a friend, all of us sitting together to enjoy the show. Snacks were on sale at reasonable prices and easily accessible."
179,Fairly good access and very helpful staff.
180,"Very Good has lift inside the pub to chose whether you eat upstairs or down, very spacious"
181,"Access granted at short notice when 48 hours normally required (plenty of space near door to lift on car deck needs to be allowed for wheelchair access).  Ramp for wheelchair provided and friendly, helpful staff checked all was ok throughout the crossing.  Wightlink provide a very useful leaflet explaining what to do,  with phone numbers etc."
182,I asked several staff questions about accessibility and everyone was happy to take time to talk to me and discuss what the library has to offer.
183,"The venue was busy during our visit it was however very easy to find a table and move a seat out of the road to let wheelchair access the table.
The main passage along the ground floor was wide enough to let people pass the chair but people pushing there chairs out toto the bar etc. made it difficult at times.
The venue does welcome assistance dogs "
184,"The gentleman that served me was a bit grumpy but he did oblige when I asked him to check the allergy/ingredients book.
The lady that made the drinks was friendly and carried my drink to the table for me."
185,Day out with PA and friend
186,Four wide disabled parking spaces adjacent to the entrance. Unfortunately it is so popular these are normally full at busy times of the day.
187,"We only came into contact with one member of staff - the tour guide, who gets high marks from me; he knew his stuff and had an easy way about him (although he didn't like the fact that I knew something about rugby!)"
188,Staff were excellent. They will be on hand if anyone needs assistance with things.
189,"The automatic door and its switch were broken on the day I visited (see my picture below). 

The bar is spacious, easy to navigate round, but has a disagreeable preponderance of high tables with high stools, so at busy times you may struggle to find a normal-height table with ordinary chairs."
190,"As a power chair user I wasn't too sure how I was going to get around the vessel. It turned out to be incredibly accessible with lifts to all levels and these were all spacious and easy to use. Staff were on hand to help with doors if required. The tour routes were wide enough to get along and there were no challenging surfaces or manoeuvres. I could see the majority of the exhibits and think I saw everything. The visit takes you on a route to  the decks and then up on to the main deck which offers a fantastic views. Below the vessel you have a fantastic gallery, cafe and a view of the hull."
191,"Staff in the information centre were very informative.
Staff opened doors for us and pointed us in the right direction when we asked them"
192,"Very small toilet. It is through two doors, both of which are fairly light. To get to the toilet you have to navigate through the bookstands and the high chairs which are stored behind the outer toilet door, making it so you cannot open the door fully. I have a very narrow manual chair but I still struggled. 

 In the small area between the doors, it is used as a storage area for a folded wheelchair and various cleaning supplies. This is also where the baby changing table is located. This narrows the space, making it hard/impossible to turn your chair around if necessary. 

The mirror is too high to see yourself if are at a seated height and the taps are push taps which are fairly stiff so would not be accessible to those with weakened arm/hand strength. 

No emergency red cord at all.

"
193,There is an accessible toilet close to RADA Bar.  The toilet was clean and spacious. It had grab rails and an emergency red cord which reached towards the ground.
194,"The car park surface is loose chippings so not the most even surface for walking on. The trails marked as wheelchair friendly were good. As I have quite a robust wheelchair trike, I managed some of the more challenging paths."
195,"Almost all helpful and welcoming, and nobody terrible! Honourable mentions for the shuttle bus driver and the swimming pool staff member who helped us with the accessible changing room and waterproof wheelchair."
196,Very pleasant and friendly.
197,Very wheelchair friendly. The accessible rooms are great. Highly recommend this hotel for anyone wishing to treat themselves.
198,"Flat and Level access  although there is a slight ramp in out patient reception. 
Some of the doors are heavy to open"
199,Gravel car park no allocated spaces 
200,Staff were very friendly and helpful 
201,"We drove there and parked in the blue badge area, which is nearer to the entrance. The bays aren't well marked, so it was down to each individual to decide how close to park to the next car. We left plenty of space as the car next to us looked like it had side loading for a wheelchair, but when we came back for lunch, another car had squeezed in, making it tight for us and impossible for our presumed side entering neighbour."
202,"Part of the hotel bistro is not suitable for wheelchairs, but friendly staff will reserve you a table in part that is."
203,"As this is a pedestrian area there is no parking outside the shop the nearest parking is on St John St or around 400m West down the Main St however these Blue badge spaces fill up quickly.
The nearest Bus stop is Jackson St which is a 10min walk away "
204,These seemed fine
205,This has become a local family favourite for us. Our daughter has cerebral palsy and is a full time wheelchair user. There are disabled toilets with radar key but havent checked them out. We usually need a changing places or go home for toileting needs as we need a hoist and level access. There are disabled bays but the car park does get quite full. 
206,Although the main entrance has two steps and steps/ramps inside. There is a flat side entrance that takes you directly to the stalls avoiding the theatre lobby.
207,"We were going to a gig at Òran Mór on Friday night and we wanted to do it on the cheap because we had been rather social recently. We had a banana and a chocolate bar on the bus but fancied a snack, which was better than grabbing a pint. "
208,All level access. There is a lowered section at reception. The waiting room chairs can be sometimes too close together and there is no special area for wheelchairs you go where you fit.
209,"The first floor is mostly gifts, wrapping paper and cards - this all has level access.
The basement only has access via stairs below, this is where all the kitchen utilities are sold.
Upstairs seems to have more space around the stands and so on."
210,"Part of the Chef & Brewer chain of restaurants, the Shepherd's House is a very accessible restaurant offering a good pub menu."
211,"The disabled toilet is not really large enough for carer and wheelchair. it was not as easy as in some to assist  with the transfer, but it is clean and modern."
212,The museum is opposite the bus stop for Saint Martin de Re Le Port. 
213,"There are several disabled spaces right next to the entrance, but it's a small gravel carpark so you could park anywhere and be within easy reach of it."
214,"I love the staff. Very kind, feel like friends"
215,"While trains run between Whitby and Pickering, both having large public carparks, Grosmont has a reasonable sized carpark which fills long before a train departs. Goathland Station has a very small carpark will no other carpark within half a mile. All carparks require payment including Blue Badge holders. Buses to both Grosmont and Goathland but very few and far  between. As for Levisham station it is so isolated that I doubt any visitor would find it by car so little carparking is available"
216,Getting to the hotel by taxi was easy and there’s a taxi rank right outside the door.
217,1 disabled toilet near the cafe - this is the only toilet facility I saw.
218,Easy to find. Definitely accessible.
219,"We booked a wheelchair accessible cabin which had a hoist for the hot tub. When we checked in we were offered a hoist to use inside the cabin as well. There was a ramp into the cabin as well as a ramp at the emergency exit. Level access throughout and space under the hob to get close. Wet room had grab rails, a low sink, a shower seat and an emergency alarm. 

There was plastic beakers for use in the hot tub but I was able to use these for general drinking as I cant lift glasses. 

It was a lovely place that met my access needs and I'll be going to other forest holiday locations. "
220,Door to door service.
221,"The whole site is fully wheelchair accessible, wide and smooth with good gradients for wheelchairs. All pathwAys are smooth and level for walkers. Benches are situated around the site so you can rest. Everything is easily accessed. Signage is clear."
222,"Well somebody in front of us knocked there drink over and a kind hearted member of staff replaced it for her and got a mop and cleared it up, and the were friendly"
223,"Staff are always helpful, always welcoming and friendly.
They always ask if you need any help, and are approachable.will help to carry  & pack goods.
In the cafe they will carry your purchases over to your table and move furniture etc"
224,"Absolutely fantastic! Really friendly folk, tell you about the animals without making you feel like they do it all day every day but that they actually enjoy talking to you about them. "
225,We got the bus so I'm not sure about parking. The bus drops off on Chambers Street and it's a pretty steep hill down from there and then cobbled road outside the restaurant. Taxis can drop off easily outside.
226,Very Friendly.
227,door a bit stiff on your own but with someone more able would be much easier.   Staff are very helpful.
228,"As I mentioned in my previous review there are lots of parking spaces outside the entrance to Cineworld, including plenty of disabled parking spaces. There is also a bus stop which is about a 5 minute walk away from Cineworld and I think it comes from the town city center of Dundee."
229,The staff were very friendly and helpful.
230,"I saw a sign for an accessible loo at the bar - but couldn't find one. I found a large, clean one out at the lobby, which isn't too far away from the bar."
231,The parking is quite busy during the summer but the guys always manage to fit your car in. There is a lovely accessable cafe nearby and plenty of walking around on the beach and footpath.
232,Very good
233,"Westminster Station is fully step-free (District, Circle and Jubilee Lines) and several buses pass by in Whitehall."
234,"Ramp access to building, ramps within.  NLS on ground floor with ample opportunities to rest if needed.
Excellent cafe facility"
235,Excellent - really helpful and proactive.  The food is also very nice!'
236,The loo is to the right of the bar as you enter. It is a good size for bigger wheel/power chairs and has an emergency cord. 
237,All staff were lovely and most helpful.
238,"The staff were excellent, helpful and friendly. When I arrived there was a member of staff at the entrance and they were proactive in assisting me in using the passenger lift. There's more staff at reception and at the exhibitions.  "
239,"I'm delighted to report that there is a new suite of toilets (the old ones were awful, cramped, tiny, with long jumbled queues) and that the accessible toilet is perfectly configured and quite luxurious. Again: full marks!"
240,"This supermarket café  is a grand place to visit if you have any mobility issues. It is spacious and easily navigated, with nearby toilets but what makes it worth a review here is the respectful and kind approach of the café staff. It is fast food and is cheap and cheerful but is the place to go to if you are up in the lovely part of Edinburgh, close to the Pentland Hills."
241,I could get round on all the paths!  There is a tree house which is inaccessible.
242,"There is parking all the way along the High Street in Dunbar, the bus stops are within 1 min of the Bakery. The Railway Station 5 mins."
243,"No disabled parking so be prepared to park far away from the shop in order to get a parking space! Easy access if your in a wheelchair, mobility scooter etc. "
244,Complete step free access throughout. 
245,The staff is really nice and they are all prepared. They explain clearly and with courtesy all the information about the services
246,"Wheelchair accessible,  all on the flat. Lacking disabled toilets though.  Drink cheap! Large wheelchair friendly function room"
247,"The loo on the ground floor near our room was for the use of all guests & was huge, spotless, had everything thing I would expect. In our bedroom we had an accessible wet room. This was spotless & kept clean for the duration of our 3 night stay. One end had the shower which had 2 robust grab rails. The shower head was height adjustable the controls were easy to use & once set the temperature stayed constant. In the middle was a smallish basin with little shelf & mirror. The other end had the loo & a pull down grab rail. The door to the wet room was a sliding one & easy to open & close. One very tiny improvement would have been a hook to hang clothes, bathrobe or towel out of the wet."
248,There is level access to the venue with swing doors. 
249,"The Anchor does have a disabled toilet however, it isn’t very spacious if someone needs assistance from someone else. There is no changing place toilet though. Down at the beach in Broughty Ferry there is a changing place although, it is only open till 5pm in the Summer and 3:30pm in the Winter."
250,Friendly and showed us a map. I think we could have navigated the one room without the pre talk on how to see the exhibits.
251,"The Chocolate Company is located on Oban Promenade,in the quieter part away from the shops. We parked in the car park on the pie. (Free for Blue Badge Holders)

We went on a pleasant scooter friendly wide pavement in the direction of the Corran Halls , the cafe was part way along. There was level access and sufficient space for me to get inside on my scooter. There was an extensive selection of hot chocolate flavours, waffles were also available.
A box of toys was available for children. Ground to ceiling windows on the seaward side provided panaramic views of The isles. 
This is a very popular venue with queuing for tables at busy times.
"
252,Generally easy to get around as a wheelchair user. Are accessible loos on each floor (although the one on the top floor is quite tight. The cafe is fantastic.
253,Good Christmas and World War exhibition  
254,The model village is completely accessible. The only potential difficulty is that there is about 15 metres of gravel between the car parking bay and entrance. We managed no problem  pushing the manual wheelchair but may be more difficult for others depending on the weight of the person. I’m sure there would be no problem reversing up to the entrance to drop off but we didn’t need to. 
255,The accessibile toilet has hand rails however is quite small for a wheelchair user and personal assistant. I placed a red cord card on the red cord as it was tied up
256,There was a ramp via a side entrance the doors were heavy but kind visitors to the stadium helped us. The seats were easy to get to and you are clearly directed. 
257,"Requested walk in shower as am unable to climb in/out of bath. None in the hotel but “wheelchair accessible” room allocated. Hotel offered to book us into another hotel “who could better cater for my needs”. As this was a family meet up involving 8 people/ 4 rooms this was not appropriate for this visit.
Asked about Blue Badge parking reservations and told this could not be done, dispite reviews on TripAdvisor saying they could.
Room had wide door but no automatic opener, was very spacious and comfortable but the “wheelchair accessible bathroom” was just that - accessible but no rails by the toilet, the sink, soap dispenser and razor plug were all at normal height. There was one rail on the wall on the opposite wall but no grab rails to assist getting in/out of the bath. There was no bath seat nor was a none slip bath mat provided."
258,"Staff have been fantastic every time I've used the station. Even at the busiest periods, they've always ensured that I got on and off the train safely. Great work!"
259,"Nice and clean and fairly spacious, with grab rails. However whilst the door was nice and wide, because it swung into the bathroom (which was an unusual shape) it made it difficult to negotiate easily in a wheelchair."
260,"You're basically just going round the streets and stopping outside buildings, so the access was grand. No steps to worry about and the pavements had plenty of dips."
261,"Wonderful attraction, well worth a visit, well setup for wheelchair users like myself. There are a couple of things that are not completely accessible but on the whole, very accommodating."
262,"It’s easy enough to get in with help of a carer, the hotel portion has two pull handled doors, then reasonable easy enough to move but not really enough space. There was no lift, but ground floor rooms available, with just one disabled room."
263,Hoisted changing table and disabled facilities open during working hours.
264,"Room enough, but not unusually NO MIRROR!!"
265,There are a number of disabled parking spaces right at the front entrance to the restaurant. The restaurant is also located on a bus route. 
266,"Step free access, space to move around within the space, and staff willing to help."
267,Wheelchair access was very easy.  Large accessible loo at the back of the cafe (easily accessed too). Even a priority space and table for disabled visitors. Staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Awesome!
268,Please see main review 
269,"Just across the street from Edinburgh Waverley station, excellent bus and tram links."
270,"The museum is in Cimiez, a hilly area of Nice, just north of the main tourist area. It is easily accessible by public transport. I had an old guide book so the bus it recommended no longer ran there.

From the centre of Nice a bus number 15 takes you to the entrance of the park which houses the museum. The bus is quite regular and is step free with a wheelchair space.  I picked up the bus from Rue Gioffredo. The bus took about 10 minutes to get there. The route goes up quite steep hill and the stop before is called Victoria, and is almost opposite the Regina Building, a large white building on your left as you go up the hill. The museum bus stop is called Matisse / Arènes. Just passed the bus stop on the right is the entrance to the park, with a single step through a gate into the park. On the gate is a blue sign with a wheelchair user symbol, an arrow pointing left and wording saying that the PMR (People with mobility restrictions) is 100m away, see photo. Following the sign and walking round the corner to the other entrance, which is step free and also gated. While there is a sign on this gate to the Matisse Museum there is no information here about an accessible entrance, see photo. "
271,There are frequent buses from the town centre.
272,"The island has flat and hilly areas, see map photo. Walking the path clockwise, numbers 17 to 1 and 17 to 7 are flat paved pathways. The centre of the island and the right handside is hilly and have gravel pathways. There are plenty of benches to sit on and admire the views.

Along the step free route, there are several restaurants, in different price ranges, and quality craft shops. They have permanent ramps and are all single story. The only exception was the Allmogebatar exhibition (small museum) which was accessible by a couple of stairs with no handrail. I didn't go inside but there were a number of boats on display outside, which were easy to view.

I had my lunch and a delicious ice cream sundae at Systrarna Degens, a cafe and ice cream parlour in a small cottage, see photos.

Fjaderholmarna Krog, is a upmarket restaurant with outdoor seating, see photo. There is also a brewpub, which offers tastings and tours, and I noticed they had a ramp on the left handside of the building.

The craft shops are dotted about. By the harbour is a chocolate shop. Further along the path are more craft shops including a glass shop, several handicraft shops and a forge, where you can make your own silver rings. The shops sell handmade and good quality gifts."
273,The front door is not automatic however most of the year it is propped open. It is only one level. There is a small waiting area. There is a window for the receptionist which was a bit high for me in a wheelchair but the lady brought my forms round and I was able to fill everything in. There is another light door into the studio itself. The tattoo beds were very wide and could be moved up and down if you want to transfer from either side. Music or a movie is played on a screen but at a low volume.
274,Accessible loos are right next door.
275,"There was a lift.  There was enough room when moving around stalls, eating areas. "
276,There is an automatic entry door and wide passageways throughout the venue.
277,Very helpful and friendly.
278,"The staff are strange. I waited for a long time at the till, because an inattentive member of staffing, manning a free till, didn't spot me waiting. Another man was busy ignoring me at a different till, deeply engrossed in looking at stuff on his screen. For these oddities, and for failing to keep the lift in good working order, three stars lost."
279,The first entrance door has a tiny step which is OK to get over in a wheelchair then an immediate right turn into the bar area with another door. The doorways are quite tight but we managed with someone holding the doors open for us.
280,Staff and service was great.
281,"Situated in the historic Grassmarket area of Edinburgh this traditional bar is easily accessed from the street by a side door. The food was good and service, very good. Although we visited during the day, some evenings they have live traditional Scottish music."
282,"Booked a comedy night with a set meal beforehand, and had a fantastic night out.  Unfortunately the comedy club has about 20 very steep steps down to the venue, and although there are rails it is quite difficult to get down. 
If you're able to get down, it was a hilarious night out. "
283,"Dewsbury Sports Centre is very well equipped with disabled facilities. The main entrance has a ramp/slope for people with wheelchairs or mobility scooters to access easily without difficulty. Large print information is available on the premises of the sports centre. A seat is available on the premises for customers, if not readily available it can be requested when you arrive. There are accessible toilets on the premises for people in wheelchairs. The disabled toilets have a clear door width of at least 75cm and there are grab rails and drop down rails available. Dewsbury sports centre also has swimming pool facilities available. There are accessible changing rooms or fitting rooms available on the premises for disabled members of the public. The changing rooms have grab rails and a seat available inside. "
284,"The food was very nice, Staff were friendly and helpful and there is access to bathrooms downstairs"
285,"There is a wide, even path that stretches between each entrance to the park, so it is possible to go from one end of the park to the other by staying on the path. Next to the path are lots of benches to stop for a rest or simply sit and soak up the environment, most benches have an open area next to them so that a wheelchair can be placed alongside.

Some of the paths are on a slope, but there is seating close by if a rest is needed.

The woodland area is not accessible for mobility aids due to the woodchip paths and uneven terrain.  There are areas which contain steps but there are alternative routes to bypass these if  needed.  The steps in the rose pagoda walk has a handrail on either side."
286,"Good accessible toilet. Grab rails, spotlessly clean and tidy. Not the largest of spaces if you have a larger power chair but functional."
287,Friendly and accommodating. They came out to fix a problem with the hoist late at night. Thanks for a great stay.
288,"The lifts are very unreliable and when they are out, their information provision and also communication is very broken."
289,"Much of the Old Town's architecture reflects the period from 1386 to 1797, Corfu was ruled by Venetian nobility. There's lots of gift shops, cafes and restaurants in its picturesque squares, side streets and narrow alleyways. The area is popular with local and tourists alike. "
290,"The Main Bedroom with en-suite wet-room (probably the best I can recall, always hot water, surfaces to accommodate toiletries etc. (a major fault I find in holiday wet rooms)"
291,"Staff friendly, helpful and aware of the hearing loops and how they worked."
292,These are situated to the back of the cafe.
293,"Life can get so busy and so noisy, and Marks Hall is undoubtedly one of the best places to enjoy some peace and quiet. Set away from any main roads, this walking area offers a serene environment that is accessible to all. Whilst the main walking route is mostly concrete, and therefore perfect for wheelchair users, there are short sections that are grass and therefore slightly more difficult for those in a wheelchair. I would encourage visitors to enjoy this walk over the summer months, as is far more accessible to all when the ground is dry. However, it is definitely worth a visit! Not only are there large open spaces, there is also a wooded area, a river and an arboretum to explore, meaning you'll never be bored on this walk."

295,"Once you pass through the wide double doors the large, almost industrial, space is very striking. Plenty of room to wheel around, to sit and dine, and to enjoy the warmth of the log basket as it fills the space with a hint of smokiness."
296,"The tramper (mobility scooter) was only able to be booked on a Tuesday afternoon, from 13:30. Not sure why... Hordes of people, very pleased to have booked ahead.  Last disabled parking space saved for us as we had pre-booked so sailed past long queue of hot tourists in cars.  The tramper was ready to go and I could have it over lunchtime, not just to get up and down the steep river valley.  Good path, other visitors quick to leap out of my way.  I felt a bit stuck on a track but there were only 3 able bodied paths and the single tramper-appropriate one was well designed and effective."
297,Always really happy and willing to help you at every opportunity. Everyone working there seemed to be really happy to be there and it was infectious. Any problem or question I would be confident that they would do their best to help you out.
298,"Flat access and staff who rushed to open the door for me on seeing me rock up in the scooter. Room to get to the service counter inside. Easy to see and communicate with staff behind counter and get access to drinks fridge. Small space inside with high stools around tables, but was assured that a lower table could be provided."
299,Plenty of room to manouevre. Very clean.
300,"We had to book by phone, which is often the case with booking theatre tickets for a wheelchair. They told us they would have to close the stairs briefly to accommodate the wheelchair, so we had to arrive early. The theatre had a step to go in (roughly 3in), so an electric wheelchair might struggle, but for the manual chair I was using, it was fine. Once in, the staff closed the stairs to the public and brought out a machine which the wheelchair was put on, then pivoted to 45 degrees. The device then went down the stairs using caterpillar tracks, with the staff leveling the machine on each of the 2 landings. Once at the bottom of the stairs, they leveled the machine again and let me off."
301,Lots of spaces. Near venue. Good size spaces. 
302,"All seemed friendly and all 3/4 on reception were eager to help whenever required (moving and storing luggage, booking transport for outside, etc)"
303,"There are several disabled parking bays immediately opposite the Parliament entrance for Blue Badge holders.

If you're walking from the city centre it's a down hill stroll along the Royal Mile. Going down's fine but a bit of a push up if you're walking - a handy bus stop outside the Parliament and on the foot of the Royal Mile has accessible buses stopping there that will take you up the hill."
304,Fantastic access.
305,clean and accessible
306,MRC is accessed via road and has it's own small tarmac car park. There is one disabled space next to the main front door. 
307,Good car parking. Staff drove a mobility scooter out to the car park to me. There is no charge for scooter or chairs but you are invited to make a donation.
308,As I ve said they went out of their way to make us feel welcome while getting out the mop buckets at the end of a long day. Have been back on a number of occasions and always relish food - especially the scones. Possibly best in Northallerton. ANd the photographs aren't to bad either
309,Very disappointed on a visit 'home' at the distances expected to walk from disabled 'drop off'  car spaces & the uncaring attitude of the security staff at passport control.
310,Impressed with the Assembly Rooms - always pleased when events are held here as I know that there will be no problems with pals getting in and around.
311,"We had read about Rancho Texas prior to staying in Puerto Del Carmen and had it on our ‘places to visit’ list.
After queuing to pay our admission 22 Euros per non residential adult, although as a wheelchair user I paid the 2-14 years price of 17 euros, We went exploring with the aid of the guide which we were given that had a good map and time of the shows."
312,The caretaker was in a glass fronted office. I did not interact with him. 
313,Really should say not applicable as the transport is the boat!
314,"This site is by its nature inaccessible in many ways, but the use of ramps, alternate entrances and other reasonable adjustments make things as accessible as they can be. There are events planned where BLS guides are available. Not all people will be able to access all buildings, but the workers will come out and bring the experience to the person. My assistance dog was universally welcomed."
315,"Generally disabled access in the area was easy, plenty of ramps onto pavements and good access to most buildings.  Restaurants were very accommodating and made space for my powerchair at tables when needed."
316,Staff are always friendly and helpful.
317,There are plenty of disabled toilets in the cinema on both floors and near the screens. In the toilets there are grab rails around the toilet and an emergency button incase of an emergency. The toilet it self is very spacious.
318,Toilets are well sign posted around the garden centre. Fully adapted Disabled toilets are also available which on my visit appeared clean and large enough to manoeuvre a wheelchair when required.
319,"The entrance is accessible for wheelchairs and has no steps, he door is not automatic so could be challenging for wheelchair users.
There is one door at Brunch and Brew however this is wide and more than accessible.  If by chance something may have been in the way the staff were more than happy to help us move around. 
"
320,"By car, disabled parking right outside entrance"
321,"We visited the outlet at 5pm in the evening. when we first entered, there was a crowd and it was difficult to manoeuvre around. the door is a push and pull door thus it will be hard for someone on a wheelchair to enter without the help of others. on the first floor, there are limited seats available, some seats are high raised therefore are too high to reach. there are more seats available on the second floor but it is only accessible via stairs which is not wheelchair-friendly. the self ordering kiosks are also not easy to reach if the selection is too high up.  the condiments section where tissues and sauces are placed are also high and far to reach. "
322,The reporter lives right next to the accessible platform.
323,"There is a Changing Places toilet with hoist, movable bench and shower, see photos, within their Beech Street Cinema complex. In the main Barbican building there are spacious, accessible toilets with grab rails and emergency cords."
324,bus stops nearby
325,There are no step-free stations nearby. Zillions of buses go up and down nearby Oxford St and Regent St. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area.
326,"The Warner Bros. Studio Tour, or Harry Potter World, as I like to call it has really thought about the people who are visiting it, almost everything is wheelchair accessible and no-one can feel left out visiting here. Audio guides are available to everyone, have touch screens and are so easy to use. If that doesn't suit, you can arrange to have a Braille guide or even (on certain days) a British Sign Language tour guide. These lovely folks also allow guide dogs, hearing dogs and medical alert dogs inside too. There is so much to see it is really an experience not to miss."
327,"The staff are very friendly , chatty and helpful. "
328,Very helpful.  We let them know we were coming and they greeted us personally.  Escorted us to our seats and made sure we were comfortable.
329,There was an accessible loo but I didn't use / need it so cannot provide any helpful comment on this.
330,Good size and staff to help you get there through crowd
331,"The venue has a small car park at the back which is not disabled specific.
There is plenty of parking all along the quay which I normally use, although it obviously gets pretty busy in Summer.
Aberaeron itself has numerous pay and display car parks with plenty of disabled spots. All these are on the flat and within easy reach of the Harbourmaster Hotel."
332,Not accessible parking right outside but several spaces are within reach behind all of the restaurants on El Arenal. There are also parking and either end of the promenade.
333,The accessible toilets are clearly signposted and provide easy access.
334,A perfecctly flat site with wide paths make it a perfecct place to go with a family. It's great to be able to walk 4 abreast and have a conversation rather than in single file. There is an accessible cafe and toiilets and a great park for the kids. There's eaven a wide see-saw which you can go over on a mobility scooter if you want to join in!
335,"A nice little hotel on the corner of the financial district in Paris. This was my second visit and I had a great stay. Hotel is very accessible easy entry and exit with an automatic door.

Lift access available to all rooms. Accessible rooms are very spacious and the beds are a great size. 

The bathroom is also fully accessible being full wet-room style. 

The hotel has a also has restaurant but I never visited as it’s only open Mon-Thurs but from what I could see it looked to be fully accessible. 

It’s a great location for Shopping there’s a huge shopping mall nearby.  and lots of accessible eateries. I find it much better than the centre of Paris no hustle and bustle just a relaxed atmosphere that’s very pleasant when out and about.       "
336,"Being train daft, it’s not just about the mechanised side of things, but the Bologna Centrali Station is a majestic building in its own right fully modified to accommodate full accessibility, provision and services from the point of entrance, to platform to travel. Information and ticketing perfect, less than £10 return on an express train the distance of Edinburgh to Aberdeen communication no problem, recognition of my needs and provision of specialist guidance to platform, train and seat offered. Seats, carriage space greater as their track dimensions are wider, although our fasttrain to Rimini for San Marino was onlyan hour we were later in leaving, our return journey was delayed by 3 hours but each customer received a meaningful apology and a customer care pack containing foods, fruit, drinks, sweets and nibbles.

British Railways take note on all the above."
337,Very helpful! Staff member at the front door to help with any directions or any other needs. 
338,Not really needed any staff except in the Shopmobility and they are very helpful. There is a customer service desk at the Centre point of the mall if you tequire help. Also patrolling security guards should you need someone 
339,The staff were not overly helpful and did not respond to the pressing of the assistance button. I can only assume it was working as people in the queue seemed to hear it. 
340,"Both platforms give level access on there own platform two you can enter or exit via a gate in the car park strait on to the platform while platform 1 can be accessed via the station building both platforms had a few seats available to use and both platforms were of a good width as well.
our visit was during the day so unable to comment on lighting levels at night time etc. "
341,"A cafe with something different, has a comic book theme and the ability to play tabletop games such as warhammer."
342,The door opens inwards so you can't close the door if you enter in a wheechair.
343,"There are accessible toilets on the ground, second and third floors. There is no accessible toilet on the same floor as the Downstairs venue. 

I used the third floor accessible toilet, by the Upstairs venue. There was a manual door through to the toilet area and then a separate manual door to the accessible toilet. The toilet was very spacious, clean and tidy. There were grab rails and an emergency cord that hung towards the floor.

On the wall of the accessible toilet was a A4 sign saying ""Soho Theatre pull cord for help, bell will sound, help will arrive and enter at your request"". I haven't seen this before but it is excellent as the person pulling the cord knows what to expect. The only slight problem with it is that it is on the wall, at head height behind the toilet, so if I was sitting on the toilet and was unable to transfer I wouldn't be able to read the sign."
344,For a long time I wanted to pay a visit to the IWM and it was their participation in the Disabled Access Day that made me go. I met very knowledgeable guides and I felt very well looked after.
345,"Leading into hotel is a ramp, then it’s nice and level downstairs, but stairs to reach bedrooms, we did not see a lift."
346,"There is a step into the café. They have an extravagantly long folding metal ramp which they can deploy whenever you need it, and because it's so long you get a lovely smooth gentle ride up to the entrance. Some of the waiters and waitresses don't know about the existence of this ramp (the manager hasn't briefed them properly) so if you ask and you're told ""We don't have a ramp"", don't believe them!"
347,Cheerful and helpful.
348,"Tickets for the golf course can be bought at the food van next to the entrance of the golf course. The counter is at standing height. I was give a club, ball, score card and pencil. This is a mini golf course so there are short distances between the different holes. The golf course has level access but some of the holes have a slope of other obsticles to make the course more harder to navigate. The member of staff told me to leave the flag in the hole when I am playing the shot, as at the end when the ball goes in the hole I can pull the flag and it will also lift the ball, and this saved me bending down to take the ball out of the hole. When I visited there 1 of the 12 holes was missing its flag, but I asked someone else to take the ball out of the hole for me. There was a bench about half way round. It is a relatively easy course to navigate and was very doable with my crutch."
349,"Couldn't do enough - particularly the head waiter.  Very helpful - with moving chairs etc.  Assistance offered with menus, and the service was speedy.  Clearing of plates too was fast and unobtrusive."
350,"Solo traveller in electric wheelchair, hundreds of miles from home - I had a great holiday based at this 'Youth' hostel (SYHA). "
351,Parking by entrance in marked bays.
352,"As the website didn't provide any information about step free access I had to phone up to book my seat, therefore yet again disabled people don't have the opportunity to book online like the rest of the general public.  The member of staff answering the call had to go away and check. When they came back they booked me in P4 which they said was near the door, as I asked not to have to walk through the row to get to my seat.  Incidentally when I got into the auditorium, there was a member of staff standing in the corner, he didn't come over to check my ticket or to point me to my seat. I therefore had to ask someone at the end of the row what there number was and in what direct the seating went. I found out that my seat was in the block furthest from the entry door, so I had to walk through the row, past everyone sitting in the central block and then into the side block. The row was quite wide but it was still difficult for me to navigate with my crutch in the semi darkness of the cinema. I was not impressed, especially as I had for a seat so I could avoid this situation in the first place. 

I feel the staff need disability awareness training as they do not seem to understand/ empathise/ appreciate how important it is to listen to what the disabled person is telling you about their access needs and be familiar enough with the layout of the cinema that they can offer disabled customers the best seats for their needs.

I also had to collect my ticket. When I got to the box office, collecting my ticket was easy. I mentioned to the staff working there how difficult it was that there was no information on their website to inform me which rows were step free and that had left me with no choice but to phone up to book my seat. I was told by the member of staff that the row I was sitting on could NOT be pre-booked online as they did this to ensure that these seats were given to disabled people who needed them. When I got to my seat I asked the people next to me whether they booked online or phoned up for their tickets and they told me they booked their tickets online. Therefore the woman at the box office desk had LIED to me and misinformed me as the row I was sitting in was bookable online.

When I entered the foyer and had my tickets checked the member of staff did point out where the lift was, otherwise there would have been a zero score in their staff section. I asked her where the accessible toilet was and she pointed it out but omitted to tell me I needed a radar key. Thankfully I had my own but otherwise I would have got to the toilet and then needed to return to her to get a key."
353,Staff are considerate and helpful.
354,"Barcelona is a great city with plenty to do and a place that covers everything no matter what you're into. Let's get to the beef, The Nou Camp. The football was a fantastic experience and wheelchair tickets were easy to get a hold of even though they were a bit pricey (90 Euro each!!!!) But free entry for carers softened the blow a little. Regardless of the price me and my friends decided we had to go to experience seeing one of the best football teams in the world. 

The stadium itself was fully accessible with wheelchair seats placed at the top of the lower tier behind the goals. It  was decent position and we could see the full pitch clearly, with no obstruction.  The only thing which was frustrating was that we couldn't really see the full size of the stadium. From our positions the tier of seats above us was blocking our view of the 90,000 plus seater stadium. My assistant managed to get a few pictures, but obviously its not quite the same as seeing the amazing view first hand. One more thing about our seats, every wheelchair spot was beside each other which is perfect for groups of friends with wheelchairs. However seating for assistants aren't positioned directly beside the wheelchair bays. This therefore could be a problem for those who need additional support.

Moving on, all the accessible toilets were directly behind us and extremely easy to get to at any point. The toilet i used was extremely spacious with more than enough room to manoeuvre a standard electric wheelchair. 

The food areas were positioned near the toilets and was also easily accessible. "
355,Cramped building with heavy front door and no open button. Counters are rather high. Chairs create a kind of slalom where you inevitably hit into stuff. Bathroom had bad placement of cord; right in the corner where it was unreachable and it was pretty dark. Staff unresponsive to individual needs (husband nearly fell over trying to carry drinks). Drinks were standard Starbucks fodder but not on par with most Starbucks we visit 
356,There are 2 seating areas. One is a fenced off area on the upper concourse and the entrance is a step free opening. This is where we sat and from there you have nice views of the station. There is a covered roof and heaters and in February when we visited it felt warm sitting here. There is also a inside seating area. Both areas have free standing tables and chairs and the entire restaurant is step free.
357,"Wanted a quick bite before a gig at the Queens Hall, we fancied a burger, well I was after a Poutine (cheesy chips in gravy - super healthy!). 

This is definitely one of the cheapest burger joints in town - hence being it in a student area. "
358,The staff are very helpful and incredibly friendly. They were happy to assist with any questions about access or about any of the exhibits.
359,"I went here for a rugby game ... the disabled seating reminds me of a bird watching box ... my carer was unable to stand up due to the height issue for the viewing area.
The biggest and most dangerous issue was the nails and screws and staples that were showing through the ceiling and not even removed to protect people. We had to ask Scottish rugby to help us and they did but this is a issue by Kilmarnock fc as they own the stadium!"
360,"Wheelchair friendly access, with ramps and wide automatic door. "
361,Excellent.  see pic.
362,Staff were extremely nice and wanted to do anything to make my experience more enjoyable.
363,"Full marks to the staff who were great from the point of arrival through to accessing the lift, giving directions and welcoming."
364,All these buses were wheelchair accessible which was great. But as you are sitting on the ground floor the view really isn't the best. As most of the tour was talking about what you could see above us or in the distance we missed a lot of it! However it was a great way to get around the city. Also the stop that they had for the high line looked like it didn't have any wheelchair access.
365,Big wide doorways easily accessible for wheelchair users
366,It all starts with there being very few disabled parking spaces so arrive early or be forced to park quite a fair bit away from the stadium. 
367,Close to St Enoch Car Park and public transport
368,"The bathroom and loo are combined.  There is a raise seat on the loo.  The door into the bathroom is big and can accommodate a wheelchair easily, the bathroom itself is huge; has a walk in shower, no steps to get into it, has hand rails, there is also a bath tub, and a hand rail next to the toilet."
369,All of the accessible loos we used were large and clean.
370,"No dedicated loo.  However there's a single loo on the ground floor, accessible if you can walk.  There's a small step (half an inch?) down from the tea room to the lobby leading to the loo. This lobby and the loo have vinyl flooring which is quite slippery so care needed if using crutches or sticks. The door is a little stiff but not heavy - I managed it unaided. No grab rails but a ledge to one side and wash hand basin on the other provided enough support for me."
371,There are lifts inside the building. Sadly wheelchair users can't make use of the escalators on the outside of the building. Circulating spaces inside are excellent.
372,Informative
373,"Generally good for accessibility, but constant problems with lifts & horrible toilets - see below."
374,"It was quite a pleasant drive through Marlow town centre and riverside, but very difficult to find the Crowne Plaza because of road works and one way system, we kept getting lost, let’s hope when works are finished that following a Sat NAV will be easier.
On arriving we were very concerned as our first impression was that of a budget type hotel which did not impress us at all, but decided that having made the effort, 
we would check it out and offer you a review.  WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE !

Inside, it’s a delightful hotel, we were really in awe, and pleased we did persevere.
DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY YOUR FIRST VIEW OF OUTSIDE AREAS.

The Crowne Plaza Marlow hotel is ideally placed in the Thames valley and close to Chilton hills, with easy reach from M4, M40 and M25 motorways, and it’s set in 5 acres of countryside, with views over its lake setting.
Free parking, with 3 disabled bays available, a 168 bedroom 4 star hotel, built in 2002, and renovated in 2020, (but for us, the exterior deco and overall look was disappointing, a little off putting, but what a pleasant surprise inside ) with 3 floors of bedrooms, and inside you will find an AA rosette Glaze restaurant, which serve a very good Indian food menu, the Aqua bar lounge area, a conservatory with terrace seating with lawn views over to lake.

OUR REVIEW FOR PART ONE
A pleasant roadside drive with well maintained grounds leading up to hotel (photo 1) with a woodland setting for its nice carpark (photo 2), then we saw the hotel, and oh what a disappointment (3)  Our first thought was to drive straight out, it looked so drab. But having made the trip, we decided to review it anyway.
3 disabled bays stand by the main door (4) and there was a pull handled door for wheelchair access (5) the other is a revolving door, but it’s all on the level.

Inside, oh what a contrast ! The reception area was breathtakingly highly polished tiled flooring, very appealing (6) and the seating area, which we called the meet and greet area, again very comfortable and very attractively decorated (7).
The reception desk was in a huge open area, plenty of room to move around, and looked so nice (8).
We found the toilets close by (9) but no disabled to be seen (10) but both mens and ladies were clean, shining, and very nice modern design, and ladies close to mens (11) that lead towards the bar.

This was a beautiful area with its piano leading towards the bar, (12) of which the floor was unusually laid but looked delightfully shiny and added to the appeal of the area. The bar had an ambience about it (13) looking inviting, so we relaxed in the comfortable lounge and enjoyed our drinks (14).
We glanced into the restaurant, which again looked inviting (15) with an Indian menu on display. The hotel is run by very friendly polite Asian people, so if you like Indian food you will enjoy it here.Our overall look at the delightful restaurant, with its beautiful tiled floor, which gave it so much character (16) and a doorway led us into the conservatory, again inviting you to come and sit in it, (17) and enjoy afternoon tea, with very comfortable furniture (18) and a push handled door to take you out onto the terrace (19).

OUR FINAL THOUGHTS
After the disappointing frontage to the hotel, inside was so elegant and tastefully decorated, the floors were highly polished and shiny, it was a delight to be inside the hotel.
We would certainly recommend this hotel, just don’t be put off by the outside appearance.
The staff were extra friendly and supportitive, it was so nice to talk with them all. 


ON OUR PART TWO REVIEW, we concentrate on the Health and Spa club, do read this.


"
375,The access to the restaurant is fully accessible for wheelchair users via a curving pathway which is smooth. There is plenty of seating in the treehouse on the way up to the restaurant. The treehouse restaurant has a smooth and solid floor which enables wheelchair users to move around with ease and chairs can easily be moved so a wheelchair user can stay in their wheelchair and dine. Their is enough space in the restaurant for wheelchair users to manoeuvre their wheelchair around with ease. The walkways and rope bridges around the restaurant are clearly lit and fully accessible for wheelchair users. The only part of the treehouse that isn't accessible for wheelchair users is the upper level of the restaurant and the roof top viewing area called the nest these areas have stairs. 
376,"With a sense of curiosity we swept in to the car park in search of an accessible bay. Not to be disappointed we found some spaces near to the front entrance to the visitor centre. Once the powerchair was offloaded we were set to explore the visitor  centre and beyond. Clear signage, open spaces and a warm welcome made for a good start to our exploring."
377,There was a disabled accessible toilet on the main floor.
378,"The staff were helpful, jumped up to give assistance when I was struggling to get in the side door, and brought my drinks to the table. They lost two and a half stars for using the accessible toilet as a store-room for spare furniture."
379,"The venue does not have its own car park, but does have a blue badge holders car park next to the theatre for ease of access. "
380,It's a cobbly part of leith so that can be tricky. But we managed to park right beside it. It's well served by buses.
381,Many paths steep and badly rutted making them dangerous for wheelchairs. Restaurants and cafes too tightly packed to navigate easily with wheelchair.
382,"6 steps into the building at 9 Howe Street, no means of alerting staff of need for assistance unless you can get up the steps (or if you have can use a mobile phone and already know the phone number).  Main toilet includes 2 cubicles, of which 1 has grab rails.  More individual cubicles down a flight of stairs, but lighting is variable.

Garden can be reached via cobbled street and one step, but no toilet facilities.

Activities sometimes held at wheelchair accessible venues around the city, but acoustics can result in too much noise (writing as someone who can become distressed by noise and other sensory stimulation)."
383,"Stewards all lovely, helpful, obliging. Couldn't fault them."
384,Great! My pal stayed in accessible room which was spacious. The bathroom had a bath which was fine for a short stay but a wet room would've been preferable for a longer stay. The common areas of the hotel were step free - decent size lift to take you between floors. The building is the old 'lying in' hospital - and there is clever use of some of the historical aspects such as original tiles etc. 
385,Very helpful and friendly.
386,This is a fantastic wheelchair accessible art gallery and museum in the heart of Dundee. The building is stunning from the outside and just as impressive inside. Great cafe too!
387,"Disabled parking bays outside.

Public transport limited but the H1 and the Park & ride does go near by. "
388,"There is a general carpark within a short distance though a bit of a hill. Can park without paying if you have a blue badge. 
Bus stops and train station nearby."
389,"I got a taxi from the airport which cost about 20 euros. The hotel is one road behind Place de Verdun, which has a small bus station. The train station is further away, but as I didn't use it I'm sorry but unable to comment."
390,"There is a concrete path up to the main entrance, all on one level not a lot of room in the main entrance, as this is the gift shop too. (staff are will to help move things around but did not need to) I did manage to maneuver wheelchair into Exhibition room and then outside to the activities. Some parts are chipping stones not so good for wheelchair. Only part we could not access was the Crannog itself. "
391,Friendly Staff
392,"On this visit I was visiting the Cathedral's café which has a step free entrance via the Millennium Courtyard, this faces towards the river rather than Borough Market side of the Cathedral. Entrance to the café is step free. There is a self service counter. There is free standing tables and chairs both inside and outside the café."
393,Did not check out the toilets.
394,Staff are lovely. Dont be afraid to ask for help or advise from them. They are not overbearing but very accomodating
395,"I am an ambulatory wheelchair user, and live in wells. Wells is a lovely place to visit, however it’s not the best for wheelchair access. A lot of The pavements are uneven and cobbled, and there is a lack of drop curbs, but I can manage in my manual wheelchair. A lot of the shops are accessible, but a lot have small steps, or a wheelchair can’t fit round them. The wells cathedral is good for wheelchair access, with ramps and wide door ways. Good disabled parking. "
396,Staff generally nice just need more training and understanding on hidden disability's.  
397,Staff at entrance and shop were helpful and polite
398,"Very nice, very friendly."
399,"Although it is a 300-year old coaching inn, the owners have tried hard to make access as good as it can possibly be. The level access entrance porch door has a clearance of 26 inches, then a sharp left turn leading into the reception area. On our visit, the wheelchair user was in a Sunrise Quickie 6-wheel and she is a very experienced driver. She managed with relative ease, but anyone with a larger manual or powered wheelchair might struggle to manoeuvre. Previous diners using a wheelchair have opted to phone ahead to check access and one keen diner even visited ahead of booking to make sure she wasn't disappointed. Staff are more than happy to discuss your access needs in advance to ensure you have a positive experience. 

The reception/ bar and restaurant are on ground floor level and have level access throughout. There are no doors between each of the 3 dining areas. The reception area has comfy chairs and fixed, padded, bench-type seating, all without arms. A seat with arms can be made available and all tables and chairs in this area can be moved around if required. The reception/ bar area has wooden flooring and there is short pile carpet in the dining rooms. Diners can enjoy aperitifs and canapés in comfort whilst choosing from the menu and are then escorted to their table once their meal is ready. All dietary requirements can be catered for with prior notice.

Lighting throughout the building is natural daylight. There are wall lights, and candles on tables throughout the restaurant. For guests staying in The Residence, there is good lighting throughout the car park and between the bedrooms and the restaurant. There is a monobloc path from The Residence to the restaurant with a slight gradual slope from the Residence. 

There is a manual, double glass door at the entrance to The Residence, with a very small raised lip. A member of staff is normally on duty at reception between 8.30am and 8pm to assist if required. There are eight suites in The Residence, seven of which are split level with bedroom and bathroom on the lower floor plus a separate living room on the upstairs mezzanine level. The corridor and rooms are carpeted.  There is also a fire door half way along the corridor, which shortens the distance from The Residence to the car park and the restaurant. At the far end of the corridor, there is one level, designated accessible room with lots of space to move around, plus a luxurious, en suite wet-room. There is a small, raised lip of 1.5 cm to shower entry. There are lever taps on the washbasin and bath, with horizontal and vertical, colour-contrasted grab rails around the shower. The floor is tiled and there are down-lights throughout bathroom. All bedroom furniture can be moved to suit guests' needs. The wardrobe has a pull-down rail for easy access. 
"
400,"The doors are manual, very heavy and difficult to operate from a chair. It’s clear they haven’t been tested by wheelchair users. "
401,"From car park, proceed to brick arch past picture framer and jewellers. There are really high speed bumps so care needed.  No drop kerbs to get onto pavement which is bricked and slightly uneven. Once through arch, Bricks is in corner to right.
Ramp to door is very steep and needs re laying.  Double doors have to be unbolted to get wheelchair through. Sadly staff did not help Carer.
Level once inside. Could only access lower level though.  Tables outside on brick terrace if warmer.
Inside was incredibly warm and stuffy."
402,"Toilets excellent but if in the Lantern you'd have to take the two lifts mentioned above, and go through a corridor (with a bit of a thick carpet) and past the bar which is a bit of a long way.  If in the main hall downstairs there's a disabled toilet off the opposite side to the entrance which is not signed at all (and it's up a sloping corridor but still the quickest option)."
403,Thoughtful access to each area with carefully placed ramps.
404,"There is definitely a good staff presence on the floor and appear willing to help customers. I spoke to a lady at the till who was very friendly, but wasn't too sure about some of the access questions I had about the store."
405,"The door way has automatic doors, when in there are now screens to buy tickets, but I opted to get mine from the til which are now upstairs. It seems you can't use a CEA card at the machines. The lift hasn't had an upgrade sadly and is still very small and difficult to turn in, but it does the job! 

There was a lower til but no one came to serve us there so I went to a normal til which was too high so my friend had to do everything for me, it's actually taller than the old tills. This would be fine if staff asked wheelchair users if they would like to be served at the lower till, as I'm guessing that's what its for. 
EDIT: I went to see another film already and was served again at a high til. I asked about the lower area and asked if this was for wheelchair users, the staff member was very nice and said she guesses so, so I asked if wheelchair users can be seen there instead then as the desk is too tall and she just agreed that the other tills were too high. So it seems they are reluctant or unable to easily move tils and the lower bit is not manned. 

Now for the actual cinema... SO much better! The first thing I noticed when we reached out screen room was the sets of doors were further apart which was a great improvement for getting through in my wheelchair. When you get through the doors the isle up to the seats is on a slope and there are handrails at each side. The isles are well lit and in screen 1, the wheelchair spaces are a few rows back from the screen- I prefer to be a little further back and not so close to the screen. There are little lights on the floor with the wheelchair symbol and seat number. I decided to get out my wheelchair and try out the new luxe seats and couldn't believe how comfy they were, like sitting on a cloud! There is a tray table that moves and has a cup holder, and arm rests that lift up. On the inside of the left arm there are flat black buttons, on pressing these the leg rests slowly rises and lifts your legs up effortlessly, then the back rest starts to recline. It was so comfy I could have slept there! There are less seats in the cinema and more space, it is well lit and easy to move about in. 

The cinema have showings with audio descriptions. There are also showings with captions which are listed separately online. There are Autism Friendly showings on Sunday mornings specifically designed for those with sensory processing issues; the lights and sounds are lower, there are no trailers or adverts, and more allowance for increased levels of movement and noise

All screens have step free access. 
The isense screens are much louder"
406,The staff I encountered were very helpful.
407,"Didn't have much contact with staff, so can't say."
408,Very friendly staff
409,The staff are brilliant 
410,"Drove to Omni which is a Q Park, lots of disabled bays. Couldn't tell you of public transport."
411,We travelled to the cottage by car and parked in its car park. This was right next to the cottage and had a tarmac surface. Access to the cottage was along a paved patio to a level threshold entrance.
412,disabled access available	There is lots of seating in the waiting area and it has a nice community atmosphere. There are no automatic door at the entrance unfortunately. There is no induction loop.
413,Large enough for a powerchair
414,"Paths around the park are flat, wide and either asphalt or compacted gravel. The most difficult paths are in front of the country hall, where the gravel was quite loose. My trike was fine but I would have struggled in my manual chair. My sister pushed my mum in a transit chair and she was fine but she is quite strong. There is a dedicated accessible walk through a small woodland area, which was superb! It takes you up close to the Go Ape area, so if you have kids in there, you can watch them and take photos. 

The courtyard area has a coffee shop. I didn't go in. Hubby went and bought for the whole group to minimise numbers for Covid restrictions. The outdoor seating area was pretty good. I couldn't get my trike right in to the table but close enough to sit and chat with family whilst having coffee and a cake. "
415,Plenty of room in bathroom and ceiling hoist there too.
416,"There are 2 entrances to the church. The one from a small square has a large flight of steps to the entrance, see photo. The other entrance is from Saint Spyridonas Street, which only has a couple of steps (sorry no photo). Once inside there is seating. There is a single nave and the church is richly decorated."
417,There is plenty of room and easy automatic doors and there are hoists.
418,Good access member of staff came and took us to the changing places changing room then came back to assist us to the pool
419,"CodeBase is easy to find at 38 Castle Terrace. If you are getting dropped off there is ample space outside for a car or taxi to pull over. 

If you are taking public transport, the nearest train station is Haymarket which is around 20 mins walk away. The nearest Tram stop is Shandwick Place which is around 10 mins away. Lothian Road is just a few minutes walk away and there are multiple buses routes that have stops nearby.

There is on street parking on the streets around CodeBase although no dedicated Blue Badge spaces. The nearest Blue Badge spaces are outside the Lyceum Theatre which is about a 5 minute walk. There is paid parking in the Castle Terrace NCP which is just a couple of minutes away but this is fairly expensive!"
420,"We had to collect our tickets from the Show Day Box Office as we had misplaced ours at home. It is not clearly signposted where the box office is and as a result we found ourselves walking around the outer perimeter to try and find it. 
There are lifts available to take you to concourse level and there is a specific queue for accessibility ticket holders to get through security without having to join the large queues. The entrances to the seating area is quite narrow and the doors can be difficult to open. Also trying to get out at the end of the show can be tricky if others who are in the general seating starting also use the same set of door to exit into the concourse"
421,"The franchises Lyn and Donald were very friendly, cheerful  and  helpful , as were all their staff"
422,"The staff treated me like a VIP, really helpful friendly and efficient.  Moved my account to this bank. "
423,Really helpful. Security staff are great and hold doors open when they see you approaching. They also help where they can with the aforementioned lift. Hospitality staff were also great.
424,"A fantastic place set in woodland near Aviemore where young people with additional needs can have fun, try out new things and enjoy the great outdoors!"
425,There were no toilets in this shop.
426,"Just a disabled loo, but a change table and screen in the buggy bunker. The volunteers are trying to get a full changing places asap"
427,There are good accessible toilets in some of the shops at Craigleith Retail Park. Can't comment on Davidson's Mains.
428,Very accessible for wheelchair users. Very friendly owners who do all they can to help. Clean and fresh. Pool is heated and amazing
429,2 accessible toilets  available
430,"Flat thresholds into each cabin, wider than standard doorways for wheelchair access, wet rooms, kitchen units move to allow a wheelchair user to get close to the work tops, recline/riser seat, higher toilets with toilet frames, grab rails, electric beds etc."
431,"They bend over backwards for everyone, not just me! The owner is always floating around, checking up on the customers, chivvying up the staff."
432,Very helpful
433,"Lift to all levels, Electric doors with low level push button"
434,Good access throughout centre and easy to get around inside TOG 24 store.
435,Reception staff helpful but others not interested when informed about lack of access. Practice manager suggested looking at another surgery when informed that the toilet door would not close when wheelchair is inside
436,I enjoyed the music playing and family-friendly atmosphere but I thought the car parking needed improving for disabled people.   
437,"They tried to be helpful, but when asked for a large print menu with several days' notice, insisted that this was impossible because they hadn't done it before."
438,very attentive and friendly
439,Ok. First loo we were shown to  had steep steps!
440,There are multiple accessible toilets on the ground floor. 
441,Super kind and helpful when making sure the ramp was placed safely.
442,"Could only access half the inside and outside areas and even then had to take a different and longer route than the able bodied.
Access to the gardens and park was via a long route round the perimeter with some fairly steep slopes and had to phone for a code to open a gate. If you go there write the code down as you will need it to get out again and the phone number is only displayed on the outside. 
There is no disabled access to the water gardens. Paths are gravel and very hard going in places.
To access the family pleasure gardens for disabled visitors you have to go back to your car and drive there. As I had arrived by coach I couldn't get there at all. 
On the plus side there are mobility scooters and wheelchairs available for hire free of charge but you cannot take the hired scooters into any of the indoor areas. The staff were very pleasant and helpful if you could find them.
"
443,"Staff on ticket barrier duty are friendly, cheerful and helpful. Some platform staff are friendly and keen to help, others are shockingly and disgustingly rude. Some platform staff have absolutely no idea how to deploy a manual boarding ramp safely and legally, and are putting passenger safety at risk of accident and serious injury - they do not secure the ramp to the train floor as is their legal obligation, so that the ramp rests loosely on the doorplate and could easily slide off and crash to the platform floor during use. "
444,"The Wellcome Collection is a free museum which specialises in health and health related sciences. It's fun and informative an has  both permanent galleries and temporary exhibitions which cover a diverse range of topics. Also located in the building is it's library which is free to join, a café on the ground floor and a restaurant on 2nd floor, both offering a delicious range of food and a shop selling books and quirky gifts. They also hold regular free events, on both a prebookable and drop in basis. It has excellent disabled access."
445,"All very friendly, kind and helpful."
446,All the staff I dealt with her helpful and friendly. I would like to comment that the gentleman (sorry didn't catch your name) in the information centre was more than happy to help with my research of the park and answered any questions I had happily.
447,I have been to several Cote restaurants recently since I realised the restaurants are accessible. The three I have visited all had a step but after phoning in advance I found out they all have a fold away light weight ramp kept by the front door. I have turned up on my own and just waved to a member of staff who have come outside straight away to put the ramp out for me or I have asked a friend to pop in and ask the staff for help. The staff are relaxed and made me feel very comfortable.
448,There was an accessible toilet on the ground floor.
449,A carpark on Marygate offers excellent disabled spaces which are large and close to the attrations. The carpark is pricey however.
450,"This castle has been a ruin for 200+ years. A wheelchair user could get the whole way up from the visitor centre to the gates then would be met by a large 150mm step, it would be ace if there was a small ramp so everyone could at least get into the castle walls and experience the interior setting (the two Yew trees at the entrance are absolutely stunning). The ground surfaces are remarkably flat and easy to walk on, though I had to take care as I can loss my balance on the silliest thing. 

The spiralling staircases can not be helped and are my biggest nightmare but they weren't too bad if I went down slowly, no one came up and their was a human in front of me that I could fall onTO if I lost my balance! Ha! I genuinely thought these spiral staircases weren't too scary or busy.

The viewing platforms have amazing views and the one at the very top is built of 80's steps but they go up and down about 100mm each slab, so you'll need to take care. 

Signage boards are great and really interesting - we got the booklet for £2.50 and I would recommend getting it. 



"
451,Everywhere is very accessible although the ramp to the pet shop area is a little steeper than I would like.
452,"Had to ask where toilets were.
Sliding door to heavy to move on own, 
Difficulty accessing toilet, because of nappy changing mat left hanging down and blocking access. 3 large bins in the room reduced room to manoevere wheelchair. Grab rails in situ, and accessible sink. Emergency cord tied up and inaccessible from wheelchair.
As with many disabled toilets that double as nappy changing room, unpleasant smell of soiled nappies.
Had to text my brother to come and open the sliding door of the toilet, as I could only reverse my chair out as there was no room to turn due to bins, and heavy sliding door was impossible to move "
453,The botanic has been made accessible so it can be appreciated by everyone and it is a true joy the glorious sunshine.
454,"The disabled toilet located in the entrance/gift shop is clean, well supplied and accessible.  The doors to the rear of the shop which offer access to the rest of the attraction have to be negotiated as the toilet is located to the left, these doors can be held back to help with access.  The toilet itself would allow room for a wheelchair user to manoeuvre and includes enough space for a carer.  There were other disabled toilets available in the main village car park, the castle, tearooms and the Boars Head, pub and restaurant in the village."
455,"The accommodation was fully accessible with ramps around the property and even down to the garden and patio area. You could get up close to the river.
There was a wet room shower and an accessible spacious toilet room.
The onsite managers were extremely helpful and understood our needs."
456,"Gert & Henry's is a traditional pub in the Street Food Market just off The Shambles in York city centre. The manual door is perfectly level & wide enough to accommodate my wheelchair (read: my large butt). Staff will greet you at the door & show you to one of the three accessible tables; two are in alcoves with space for one wheelchair on the end, & one is up against a wall. All other tables have several steps up to them. The restaurant is table service, & the till to pay is in the wheelchair accessible area, so this doesn't particularly matter. Staff are very friendly & accommodating, were completely un-fussed by the wheelchair, & I got the very rare experience of being able to eat & drink in a traditional pub.
There is actually a full adult changing room available around the corner, & unlike the normal-people toilets you don't have to pay to pee.
Do not do the Shambles from a wheelchair unless you have strong teeth & a good bra (if that applies)."
457,There is level access into  he cottages ( three are across cobbles three are paved).  I did not measure the width of the doors.  Should have .  Sorry but they seemed far narrower then the modern building reg width.  No lift
458,"A delightful, small hotel in a former Seamen's Mission on Nyhavn (Copenhagen's canal waterfront).  Currently there is some access and it was suitable for my mobility needs, but it is not step free. When I visited in August 2018 the hotel informed me of it's plans to increase its number of rooms and will temporarily close soon so they can refurbish the hotel, which will include better accessibility, so if you are considering booking please check with the hotel to see its new facilities."
459,"Again, the fact that Whelan's can get really busy means that the bar staff will be on their toes with serving drinks so if you're looking for the key for the bathroom, you could be waiting a while. However, they are very friendly and if you ask the bouncers, they will look after you."
460,This is a spacious level access restaurant located on the top level of the Ocean Terminal shopping centre.
461,Drive right up to the front door - oodles of transfer space and often a helping hand on offer! 
462,"It was a big ""ask"" to find somewhere within easy reach of London that had really good wheelchair access AND let you take your pets, but after a huge search, I finally found it. A lovely location, helpful owner and genuinely good access. The overhead hoist system is great & goes from the bedroom through to the spacious wet room complete with shower chair. Cannot recommend it highly enough."
463,I saw or saw signs to an accessible toilet but didn’t use it.
464,"There is no official parking, it is directly across from Dundee bus station and in the centre of town so easy to access by bus or train. There’s a little lane next to it that’s perfect for being dropped off by car. "
465,Level access into and around the building let down by tables very close to each other and a very tight turn into the accessible toilet. The food quality was poor.  A few accessible parking bays outside.
466,Very roomy and great condition toilets for a public space. There would be room for a hoist and they are spotlessly clean too. A hoist is not provided but they are very accommodating so I cant imagine that being a problem if it was required. Nice light doors too.
467,"There were staff members on the ground floor, one approached me to see if I needed any help or directions."
468,The staff were very approachable and friendly. 
469,Accessible toilets on the ground floor needing lift therefore if you are in Casino or private function rooms but the toilet that I visited was well kitted out though probably not that large. It was clean tidy and uncluttered
470,"The quad is a fully accessible building with a level access and automatic front doors. It has lift access to all floors and  accessible toilets on each floor with an electronic cord which can be pulled to indicate that the person is in need of help. There are access spaces available in all cinemas which can be used independently or have enough space to bring a companion or carer. The quad also has a scheme which allows careers to see the film for no cost. They also offer a wide range of adaptions to make it accessible to all such as induction loops, soft subtitled screening  for those who are hearing impaired. The soft subtitles provide more information such as describing if something is sung; Audio description is available for people who are partially sighted whereby they can listen through a headset to describe what is happening on the screen during certain dialogue breaks. The Quad also produces large print brochures to display the films that are currently playing which, the staff are more than happy to hand out and can be arranged to have them posted to the customers homes. The Quad is a creditability provider and credibility verified accessible building which is designed by disabled and older people to ensure the service is competent and they are open to feedback regarding improvements to the service. "
471,Access as recommended by the rear doors to the hotel on the riverside. Can be somewhat chilly and windy depending on the weather obviously to get from car park to these doors!  Once inside the hotel and restaurant are fully accessible with level access to and around the restaurant. A variety of seats from freestanding to banquet.
472,Careful attention has been given to the disabled access. Approaching the building found staff happy to help with the doors. An accessible toilets were available. The floors level and easy to get around for wheelchair users. The light colours and contrasts made it a good place for people with limited vision.
473,Staff were very welcoming and helpful. They offered me a seat with a view by the panoramic window. Space was quickly and quietly made for me to approach the table and get comfortable with my powerchair.
474,"We booked a private tour by car.  The driver loaded/unloaded and pushed my wheelchair which made the trip very easy.  There was also an option of a wheelchair accessible vehicle, but this was not available at the time of our visit"
475,"The staff were very helpful and friendly. The reception staff ordered me a taxi on departure and it arrived in a couple of minutes. The waiter staff were always very attentive although the restaurant was busy. However, I was booked on a dinner, bed and breakfast basis and hadn't booked a time slot for dinner on Saturday. It wasn't a deal breaker but I was left standing while the member of staff went through pages of their list before they found my name and confirmed that they could get me a table, and I think given I have a visible disability/ crutch, it could have been handled a bit better. Therefore my advice is if you go make sure you pre-book a time slot for dinner. 
Big shout out for the cleaning staff who were amazing, not only was my room kept lovely and clean but they would see me coming and go and push the lift button for me, when I arrived back after breakfast and they had just started cleaning my room, they left so I could get ready to go out. They are a real credit to the staff team."
476,"Disabled parking at front and rear of building. Level access to bars food , loo and rooms."
477,Plenty of disabled parking bays but (as with a number of venues) the lowered kerbs could be improved.
478,"Without doubt, the staff and volunteers in the Abbey made the visit that bit special. From the security man who helped us negotiate the entrance doors, the admission desk man who offered us free entry, through to the stewards who helped with understanding the map, issuing the audio guide and setting us on the route to follow. On leaving we had to take a different route to exit and the stewards took care to make sure we still managed to see the Coronation Chair which was on the standard exit route. They then escorted us through the Abbey and bid us a safe journey as we departed. Well done!"
479,Very friendly and helpful 
480,"I had a poor customer experience, when faced with difficulties in the changing room the assistant, didn't wait to see I needed more help, she didn't come back to check on me and to be honest I felt as if I was being a nuisance for asking for access.  The manager did take a note of my disability complaints, however didn't follow through with checking if I needed anything else, or any more help. I really felt there was a lack of disability awareness among the staff and wonder about staff training on disability."
481,"The hotel itself is pretty wheelchair friendly as there are slopes instead of stairs, in many areas of the hotel. There are also lifts to all floors of the hotel, so you have access to all the fantastic facilities. Facilities include the bar, indoor pool, gym and sauna. The staff are very helpful and the hotel itself is friend airy, modern and bright. In regards to the parking, there are disabled parking spots for that should not be an issue. "
482,Very helpful
483,Great disabled toilet. Has a baby changing fold down table in it but it isn't a problem.  Plenty of grab rails and red cord. The toilets are in the cafe
484,"Great staff, very friendly and helpful. You are always greeted at the door by whoever is hosting for the evening."
485,The disabled toilet was outside which was a bit of a pain as would have liked a disabled toilet nearer the restaurant.  Just enough space to manoeuvre with a carer but disappointed it was outside as it was quite a chilly day.
486,the access was superb
487,"There are accessible toilets in both the main museum building and Mail Rail. In the main building there are toilets on the ground floor next to the self service counter in the café. There are a number of individual unisex toilets, some of  which also have a wheelchair symbol on the door. In the accessible toilets there are grab rails and an emergency alarm, although the cubicle I used the cord was clipped onto the grab rail.
In Mail Rail the toilets are on the lower floor. The signage for the accessible toilets in the Mail Rail was non existent. I raised this with staff when I was there and they said they would address it. There is a large screen with seating, which is separate from the  Accessible Rail Mail Show. Either side of the screen are doorways which have the unisex toilet sign at the entrances. There was no accessible toilet sign. Looking face onto the giant screen through the right hand doorway is an accessible toilet with grab rails but no emergency cord and only a unisex toilet sign. There is also another door which has a triangular fire notice on it, which gives the impression of it being a cupboard, and it was only on closer inspection that we realised that the lock was for a radar key. I used my radar key and discovered that it was a Changing Places toilet, with a bed, screen, hoist, grab rail but no emergency alarm."
488,Helpful and approachable staff. Enthusiastic about the library and its services. Happy to help where required.
489,Very easy access both to get in to the venue and to get around inside with lifts and staff to assist you to get anywhere in the theatre. Always a very pleasant experience whenever you visit the theatre.
490,Plenty of disabled parking. Show your badge to the parking stewards as you enter the zoo and they will direct you to the disabled parking bays close to the zoo entrance. 
491,"There is a train that goes round the park where you can feed the beautiful animals and there is a spot for a wheelchair. The animals range from chickens to a donkey, goats and Rhias and Wallabys. A fun day with our little nephew!"
492,"The Edinburgh International Conference Centre was easy to find and once inside it was a great space to be in. With a warm welcome at the door, friendly staff showing the way and good facilities it was a great start to the day."
493,"Travelling in to and out of Tenerife airport we were met by a dedicated airport staff member who facilitated our total journey from plane to transport and the reverse, pushing the manual wheelchair.
Our transport was via LERO wheelchair accessible coach (which is based at Mar y Sol Hotel but available to anyone) again the driver loaded both cases and our wheelchair from the arrivals lounge in to the hotel.
The accessible coach is also available for  taxi services or for days out to popular venues carrying disabled and able bodies guests."
494,"Clava Cairns is set away from the main Inverness to Elgin road and requires visitors to negotiate a labyrinth of country lanes; becoming single track as you get closer to the monument. It’s a place where public transport doesn’t call so you do need your own means to get there. 

The car park is small and created with an impacted pinky orange gravel. Not without a few puddles it’s good enough to be able to wheel around fairly easily. The parking is random with no clearly defined bays. Choose your spot carefully if you need side access to get you wheelchair into the car. "
495,External signage  to wheelchair area in away stand not obvious but this wasn't an issue on our visit the stewards told us which 'turnstile' to go by (there was a door next to the turnstile for disabled access). No lift or stairs to negotiate as the stadium is on a slope so going in at ground level meant straight through to viewing area which was effectively about 10 rows above pitch level. 
496,"I found the staff not to be very helpful they kept telling me to look on the shelf when I told them which items I wanted to purchase. They didn’t quite grasp I couldn’t see or reach any of the items on the shelves or in the fridges. 

But once I reiterated to them at least five times they were happy yo help."
497,"It would be my assumption that Vienna Airport was lacking in various areas given it needed upgrading. There as ample signage to and for facilities  not a lot of seating other than in the eating and drinking areas, fewer lifts that were small."
498,"I only had brief interactions with staff, buying my ticket for the boat, getting on/ off the boat, cafe and shops. However, all interactions were helpful and friendly."
499,"I drove my mobility scooter from my hotel to the SSE Hydro so I can't comment on the parking but the path from my hotel to the SSE Hydro was terrible,  loads of cobblestones and kerbs with no way to get down."
500,There are lots of slots available for disabled people in the car park.
501,"Used my Welcome app and was greeted at door then escorted by Ricardo to my friend. The staff including Marketing Manager Sylvia were amazing. Very friendly, very attentive. Made me feel like a regular, so much so, I want to go back."
502,really easy if you drive
503,The staff were young and largely preoccupied with plans for Saturday night. Understandable but not helpful.
504,Modern and spacious with a great variety of franchises 
505,"At the cash desk I mentioned to the member of staff that it would be helpful if there was a sign at the Strand entrance saying where the step free entrance was. He said he would pass this onto the manager. When I went back to the Strand entrance to photograph it for Euan's Guide someone entering the shop, stopped to talk to me. She was a member of staff and took on board what I was saying and said when she sees customers with prams/ wheelchair users she directs them to the other door. Again point was taken that signage would be helpful."
506,"Because of the menu, it is help yourself (except for drinks) but all visable staff were helpful and friendly."
507,"There is a 3 cm lip at the front door which does not present a problem,  but the pull door can be difficult.  I am a frequent user of the pub and have never had to wait more than 30 secs or so until another customer wants to leave or enter,  and kind help is invariably given"
508,"Staff could not have been nicer. Checked with us on dietary requirements and were very accommodating when my friend said she was a vegetarian. 

The girl that served us was very welcoming and took time to speak to us which showed great customer service. Did not catch her name however, visited Friday 6th October at 2:30pm and she had black hair and red lipstick on. Hopefully you’ll be able to know who this is as she is a credit to your customer service. Thank you for being so friendly and attentive with providing more tea when needed. "
509,"They saved the day! I got a puncture in my scooter, and they fixed it with a new inner tube even though they hadn't seen that model of scooter before, and all for a modest charitable donation."
510,"The lifeguards are stationed here, so are able to assist with accessibility, or any other needs.  

"
511,Excellent signage.  No steps.  Level ground.
512,"Been to the Royal Theatre twice recently - good understanding of mobility issues, great staff - helpful, friendly, willing to go the extra mile to ensure we had a good experience. Very 'on the ball' ref seating, wheelchair access etc. They have a maintenace team who will remove the fixed seating to make sure wheelchair access is as good as it can possibly be."
513,Easy access at ground level with automatic door.  Large open plan set up with plenty of space.  Most of the cashiers are behind fairly high desks but there are also low tables available.  
514,"As Edinburgh grew into a vibrant city, in 1890 the Caledonian railway company extended its line, and built an exclusive high end station at Princess Street.
, and it’s main attraction would be the wonderful boutique hotel, and after almost 4 years of building, the Caledonian Hotel proudly opened its doors in 1903.
As railway travel declined, the Princess Street station was closed in 1965, and demolished almost completely around 1970. However, the hotel itself was saved, 
and later expanded to increase the size of the hotel. In 1995 it was made a Listed building, class A, and in 2000 it was sold for around 44 million pounds to the Hilton group. It was later renamed as the Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh the Caledonian.
When it was sold again, in 2018, it cost 85 million pound, and this made it one of the most luxurious hotels and an Icon of Princess street. Today, this former railway station offers some of the finest views of Edinburgh castle, and across the road from Princess Street gardens.
It was here we hoped to offer you our review.
Due to COVID 19 restrictions we are unable to give a full review, but we were allowed access to some areas though. We caught a bus from Waverley station on Princess street, to get off three stops later, (photo 1), to go to the Waldorf Astoria hotel, the Caledonian, (photo 2).  The appearance was very pleasing to the eye, and there was a ramp to enter the hotel (photo 3).  
A beautiful reception desk (photo 4) stood next to two highly polished lifts, (photo 5).
The lounge bar of Peacock Alley was beautifully decorated (photo 6) certainly had that wow factor, then a lovely staircase led up to bedrooms (photo 7).
What a hotel, elegant, beautiful, and certainly worth seeing, an ideal hotel for disabled, although bus stops mean a little walking has to be done, but everywhere in 
hotel seemed to be wheelchair friendly enough.
Then a long walk took us to Queensferry road for our bus to take us back to Princess street. (Photo 8).
Our final thoughts.
We were disappointed not to see more of the hotel, but the parts we were able to see was spotless, shiney, elegant, and you certainly felt in there that you needed to dress up. But my wheelchair and I were warmly welcomed, and we already felt we would recommend this hotel, though it would be pricey (example, from £370 a night and upwards, during September 2021). But my, would you enjoy your visit."
515,"We  stayed in the first week of November at one of their chalets.  It was adapted and all on one level.  We bought our own dinghy, but let us store it and sail it on Loch Insh, giving us help to launch and recover when needed. We were near some challenging cycle paths which was fun, and the people were helpful and very kind.."
516,Two disabled/gender neutral  toilets and a changing place available
517,Dolphin Centre  Car Park has accessible spaces and shopmobility
518,"I don’t know and public transport options, but going by car, parking etc is easy"
519,Small car park with 1 disabled bay. Parking is tight but there is a council car park opposite with good sized disabled bays
520,There are lifts to the different floors.
521,"Staff at Scarborough SeaLife were friendly and very co-operative considering it was a very busy day. There are a lot of creatures to see and lots of other events, talks and activities going on round the sanctuary."
522,"Bit difficult getting into the entrance, but doable with a bit of effort."
523,"The Prince Edward Theatre in London is currently showing the musical Aladdin, the Genie steals the show!!

A lovely old theatre, consideration is given to different people's needs in performances there, but the building obviously wasn't originally designed to cater for this."
524,"My accessible room 310 had an accessible toilet. The grab rails were a little different from home as at the hands they were padded and when I pressed down to get up, the rails would press down a bit, this was extremely comfortable as it took took pressure on the pressing down but also felt safe. There was a telephone in the bathroom.

The communal accessible toilet on the ground floor also had grab rails, but these were static and didn't move when I pushed down. There was an automatic door to enter and exit.

Both accessible toilet areas were spacious and clean with grab rails."
525,"La Bambula restaurant and bar is a real favourite of ours. We have visited La Bambula many times because it is fantastically wheelchair accessible. The view of the beach and the Montgo Mountain in the distance would be a highlight of any holiday. It has such a great vibe about it and everyone working and drinking there, who want a chilled, relaxing time. Nothing is a rush and it just all works like clockwork.  There is a wide variety of food and drinks. The food is good but if you just want a drink, then it is a great place to sit and watch the world go by or listen to live music on some afternoons.
Wheelchair access tables

La Bambula is more than just wheelchair accessible. It is tastefully decorated and quite chic in design. The feeling of understated elegance.  you really feel that you are visiting somewhere special and that they have thought about the disabled traveller.  There are a wide variety of wheelchair accessible table types both in inside and out on the large terrace overlooking the beach. They even have a shop, Boho Boutique-  really tasteful items for a great holiday purchase. Ur most recent visit was in June 2020 and there was a wide variety of different tables and seating available. During busy times in high season, that may not be the case.



Easy Access

Access to the bar/restaurant is completely flat with a combination of wooden and tiled flooring. Inside is huge and the tables are arranged well so that access around them is very good. On the terrace outside, it could be a little difficult in the height of the busy season.

Disabled access Toilet
This restaurant has a designated disabled access toilet. It is where the normal toilets are at the far rear of the restaurant through the swing doors.
How Accesssible is La Bambula?

La Bambula has excellent accessibility for wheelchair users. Larger electric wheelchairs would also easily get around La Bambula. We cannot recommend this bar and restaurant enough. It feels as if wheelchairs have really been considered it's layout.
BREAKING NEWS

La Bambula has taken out the additional disabled toilet and fitted an accessible lift for wheelchairs and those with reduced mobility. It now opens up the large upstairs terrace for all. A great addition to an already fantastically accessible bar and restaurant in Javea. I just want to say well done!
"
526,"Accessed by private hire company, who can drop off/ pick up within 20 metres or less. Ample parking available in area, within 10-15 minutes travel. Access routes untarmacked, slabs and decorative surfaces, so uneven and angled down from centre. you may to have to take a short rest or 2 if you are pushing yourself in wheelchair. If travelling by Bus, bus stop about 10 meters from entrance."
527,"Very good indeed, fully accessible, lovely staff, but the toilet prevents this being a five-star review (see below, and my photo)."
528,Parking was right outside the lodge
529,"Separate male & female toilets at the entrance of the garden. Very well presented with the luxury of  hand moisture in the ladies. Easy wheelchair access, although you have to come out of disabled toilet to dry your hands( but not to wash them)."
530,There was a rear automatic door near the toilets but I couldn' t see the way in through the fenceline for this.
531,"Room 204 has a wet room and, like almost all accessible rooms at Premier Inn it is a good size with plenty of room for a wheelchair user to move about freely.
Width of main door: 86cm.
The room is located on the ground floor of a separate block from where the reception is and the automatic door to that block is operated by placing you room key card on the sensor.

The king size bed was made up of two single zip and lock beds and, at a height of 49cm it was okay for my wife to transfer from her wheelchair. The mattress was comfortable enough, and two firm pillows and two softer pillows were available to us. 

The window looked out to a hedgerow, which helped to block out the traffic noise from the M5, just over 200 metres beyond it. The outer double glazed window could be opened to a degree, which afforded us with fresh air but, when closed along with the secondary sliding window meant there was no noise from outside to be heard
The blackout curtains were effective, plunging the room into darkness.
The A/C comes from a standalone wall-mounted unit, effectively cooling the room to 19ºC. The fan was quiet with the only noise to be heard from it being the draining of the excess water.

There were enough electrical sockets around the room but none at the sides of the bed; this wasn’t a particular problem for us but could be troublesome for a guest that needs to plug in a CPAP device or other essential device during the night.  I’m sure though that the hotel would be able to provide an extension cable.
The basic Wi-Fi was weak, with a few dropouts. Our mobile data (O²) was weak.

As is common with most of the hotels in this chain, the accessible bathroom was a good size, with a sliding door that opened to a width of 82cm. 
The thermostatic shower was easy to control and the water pressure was very good; it remained at a constant temperature whilst showering.
We often find that the shower area in PI wet rooms doesn’t have a shelf on which to place shampoo, body wash and so on.  It can be very difficult for a disabled person, when seated, to reach necessary items when the floor is the only place to put them. This shower did have a soap dish, so half marks for that, but a bigger shelf is needed.
The bathroom though was showing signs of wear and tear; the shower seat was well past its sell-by date and my wife found it to be very uncomfortable.

I would describe the room as being in the old style with a couple of additions, such as the large screen TV with the HDMI input socket below.
It was pleasing that the room still had the old style wardrobe unit, which we prefer to the ones in the updated rooms; it offers more storage capacity.  The room also lacked the vanity mirror of the newer rooms, which is always set too high for a wheelchair user.

One major problem in this room is the height of the coat hooks which, at 168cm from the floor are totally useless for a wheelchair user; see photograph.  This problem could be easily rectified; they are fixed to a wooden panel, which could be lowered to the appropriate height. Take note management! 

The hotel only has a breakfast room, which we did not use.  There is though a Toby Inn, which is not affiliated to the hotel, next door and within walking distance; we didn’t use that either. 
"
532,Were willing to help lift my wheelchair upstairs
533,"This review is about the branch of Caffè Nero facing directly onto Shepherd's Bush Bus Station, just a few yards from the Central Line station entrance. Overall I had a good experience here but the toilet was absolutely awful and I would not recommend this branch of Caffè Nero to wheelchair users."
534,The venue itself has no parking as it is located in a pedestrian precinct but there is accessible multi-storey parking very near.
535,"A wheelchair user can enter the front area where there is the display counter and the till. So it's fine for buying takeaway. But if you want to enter the tables-and-chairs area to eat in, you have to either descend six steps, or go round to the doorway in the nearby shopping arcade. However, that doorway has a step (see my photo below) which was an insurmountable barrier to my powerchair. A strong and skilful manual wheelchair user might just be able to 'jump' over this step - but Patisserie Paul should get a ramp to give access to everyone, as the law demands."
536,When trying to find the cinema the staff were very friendly and helpful. The staff were also very accommodating.
537,"A one way system round the shop area, with at least 4 disabled bays. But only one disabled bay when you finally get round to cafe."
538,Every accessory you might need either in one of the several disabled toilets or the fully functioning changing place
539,"Really accessible, easy to get about, nice accessible toilets but the staff weren't at all helpful or friendly when we were there."
540,We rocked up and my pal had forgotten his CEA Card - but the staff were super helpful and allowed us to get a free Carer's ticket anyway. Overall the cinema has good disabled access but it is worth finding out which screen is showing which film beforehand as some have a better view than others.
541,The staff we met were friendly and helpful.
542,The accessible toilets on every floor which looked spacious.
543,"Level access into the building. Good to see that there was a cafe, library, council information point and now hearing aid battery service all under one roof."
544,There is a disabled toilet with shared baby changing. The door opens outward. Did not appear to be any alarm and the lock was a simple bolt. There are grab handles but it was still a struggle to get round the toilet. There was plenty of space. To get to the toilet there is a door which makes it a bit tight but I think you can also access it from the childs play area.
545,In attentive and invisible. Plates were not cleared away.
546,As a mode of transport it was great you’ve got to be able to walk up the gang plank.
547,"We entered the main door which was a little tricky but we did get some help from staff the second time we used it. I'm sure there may be easier entrances in other parts of the store. Once inside the surfaces are smooth and easy to negotiate as a wheelchair user.  We took the nearby lift, which was beautifully decorated, down to the technology department. The lift was spacious and the signage inside explaining the different floors was really good. Getting around the departments was good as unlike many stores there was plenty of room between the displays."
548,"Always top marks, very helpful, willing and polite, and offering full support to the disabled, thank you all."
549,"The disabled access toilet is on the ground floor just behind reception, through a door which has a sign saying members only area. Due to it's location the person with a disability would have to ask a member of staff to gain access to the toilet. The toilet has grab rails, reasonably spacious and well maintained. The main toilets are in the basement and accessible by lift, but I didn't use these."
550,"Gradual ramp at entrance and wide, automatic, sliding doors. Lots of space inside so I was able to park my scooter without blocking any tables or chairs. I didn't notice signage."
551,Fine but had to untie red cord and add a red cord card. 
552,Generally perfectly accessible with staff willing to do all they can to help. 
553,"Wheelchairs can be used throughout the building with a fully Accessible main entrance from the street. They have one manual wheelchair which can be borrowed if needed.
They also welcome assistance dogs, and can provide water bowls for them. You can ask staff for assistance.
The tour in sign language is also available.
Hearing loops can also be found in the building."
554,"The other plus of this hotel is the free parking facility for guests.  There are bus stops right outside the hotel and one can be in the center of Edinburgh within 25 minutes, or just a short walk to the Ocean Terminal complex or restaurants.  We also thought the cost of £192.78 for three nights stay to be good value"
555,"This used to be a good place to visit for my semi mobile wife and me. They have wheelchairs but parts of the site are steep so really the provided (at a small cost) mobility scooters were really essential. However, because of a recent 'health and safety' review they have reduced the number of mobility scooters to 2. This is hopelessly inadequate for such a popular site. So, if you plan to visit, make sure you do so well in advance and book your mobility scooter early."
556,"it be too dangerous for people on the wheelchair because there sand everywhere.
there is a seat if I need a rest."
557,"Level access from the street and a lift to the required floors.

Hearing assistance."
558,The door frame around the entrance is too small but the toilet is accessible with rails.
559,Two spaces immediately outside.this may be inadequate at busy periods
560,"Overall, a good experience."
561,A number of disabled parking bay available in the car park.
562,The disabled loo was one of those set-ups where they make one bigger cubicle in the ladies' and gents'. Clean and spacious (with polite customers giving wheelchairs priority) but could have done with more rails - just the one small one on the wall to the right of the loo.
563,"Is in the shower room and difficult to put powerchair in, easy for manual wheelchair and doors open outwards . Toilet has a lid."
564," Most of the places of interest where are accessible .
 I was impressed that the trolley buses had designated wheelchair spaces but was also annoyed not all of them had working pull out ramps."
565,"8 disabled bays are available towards the entrance gates of Wentworth Garden Centre. On my visit, these disabled bays were full with a couple of cars queuing for a disabled by to become available. Due to the business, car parking spaces close to the entrance on levelled tarmac are quickly taken. Although the garden centre does have a large car park besides the disabled bays, uneven, pebbled ground which could hinder manoeuvring wheelchairs.

A bus stop is located a short 5 minute walk from the garden centre which buses from the centre of Rotherham run frequently throughout the day."
566,"To get into main entrance of this Waterstones flagship bookshop in Piccadilly, you would have to descend a small flight of steps. A brand new platform lift (see my photo below) has been provided alongside these steps for anyone with wheels or with mobility difficulties. However this lift, although brand new, was broken on the day of my visit. I was not able to get into the shop via the front entrance. 

At the back entrance staff will deploy a portable ramp for you to enter the shop, but there is no doorbell or other way of alerting staff to your presence outside and your need for a ramp. So access to the back entrance is difficult. 

Good but unreliable lifts between the floors - and they are terribly slow, their entrances are horribly narrow, and staff pile up stuff around the outside of the lifts, making it hard to get in and out if you're using a wheelchair.

The display tables are often much too close together to allow a wheelchair to pass between them. This makes navigation around the shop really difficult, and some areas simply cannot be reached in a wheelchair because of the tiny gaps between tables obstructing the way."
567,One disabled toilet . Clean and roomy with a feature of indvidual towels
568,Hard to rate higher as seating area which would include wheelchair areas not yet installed.
569,"The access of my visit was much better than some previous visits. Wheelchair access is much better as you follow the large clear signs around to the side entrance. The once tricky ninety degree manoeuvre off the pavement and into the courtyard is no longer. A lovely wide concrete ramp leads you off the raised pavement and gently down in to the courtyard area. From here you cross the courtyard and use the ramp to climb up on to the patio style area and in to the main building. 

Once inside you can visit the cafe and the galleries and performance spaces. An elderly but reasonably spacious lift takes you to the upper floors. If you're visiting the Dissection Room you can now use the bright new platform lift to get down in to the room instead of the old wooden ramp that could be a little challenging.

Generally, there's plenty of space in the building and it's easy to move around and enjoy your visit."
570,"Despite being 'rushed off their feet', all the waiting staff appeared conscientious, enthusiastic, helpful (with food choices, table access etc) and friendly. "
571,"We were in contact with the owners all the time by email or telephone, though we didn't meet with Elaine the owner we briefly met her husband as we left, nothing was an issue and we are thinking of returning very soon."
572,There are bus routes not too far away but it's a fair walk down the farm drive to the cottage. So driving a necessity really. There's a designated disabled space reserved outside the cottage.
573,Parking is on a compacted field/soil surface. 6 spaces for blue badge holders on the left of the entrance on the same ground. Drop off recommended. Smooth path to the new ticket centre entrance.
574,You can either access the pier via the 'top' part or via a lift from the seafront (this'll make sense when you're there!). The pier has level access right along it - but there was a sign up to make wheelchair users aware that because of the 'planked' surface there are sometimes gaps and if you have narrow wheels then you have to pay a bit more attention! There are quaint 'shelters' at points along the pier as well if you want to take a seat. 
575,"Disabled parking  a long distance away from the main building and was with the normal parking. There were no proper disabled bays marked out which meant that cars had parked close together so you could not get in and out of your car as a wheelchair user. it was also on stones and uneven surface with a slight slope.

They have a huge flat area nearer to the house which they could even use barriers to make a wheelchair parking area if they put some thought into it."
576,Disable toilets are excellent and on all levels. Rating 5
577,Helpful and friendly staff
578,Disabled toilets are accessible once chairs  moved as the corridor to accessible toilet doubles as a storage area 
579,Staff were friendly.
580,Staff were excellent!
581,There was one bay opposite
582,All the staff were extremely helpful and welcoming.
583,No red cord but ok.
584,"Disabled parking was scant and the ramp was not marked 
High reception desk 
Accessible toilet on ground floor and lifts to all floors
Some fire doors were too close together and thresholds to rooms unusually high and wooden 
We asked for a wheelchair accessible room and ended up in the bridal room. Big bathroom with narrow door and shower ) inches from the floor. A challenge too far"
585,Excellent staff - nothing was too much trouble. 
586,"Warm, welcoming, helpful, efficient."
587,"The accommodation was very clean and the furnishings could not be better. Facilities for me as a severely disabled person were excellent. David was always around or contactable for any queries. The Boma 7 was absolutely fantastic, it gave me freedom which I rarely get since my disability took away my independence. Thanks to David and Felicity for a marvellous time. "
588,Free parking on street before 12 noon and after 3.
589,no lift or automatic doors all areas wheelchair accessible
590,"Wheelchair accessible accommodation, which was very warm and welcoming, especially arriving on the Monday when it had been raining all day. Felicity helped unload the car and held an umbrella over Ed while he drove his wheelchair up the path to the accommodation. "
591,"The entry to King Koby is glass double doors that open outwards manually. They're fairly light weight, & just one was plenty wide enough for the powered wheelchair. There is a small ramp up to the otherwise flat shop floor.
The waiting area is wooden benches which are unfortunately inaccessible from a wheelchair, but there is room to park on the end.
The shop floor is spacious, & you may choose to remain in your wheelchair if you wish.
The payment counter is a little high, but the card machine can come loose & be passed to you.
I'm unsure about toilet access, but being in the city centre disabled toilets are available in nearby shopping centres for sure.
Staff are super friendly, helpful, & completely unphased by disability.
There is disabled parking directly outside, a taxi rank, & multiple nearby bus stops. Some of the pavements are uneven, but passable in a wheelchair."
592,Disabled loo was accessible - near the reception not far from the bar area. Very clean - nice soap! Slight sill on doorway.  Room wasn't huge but big enough to cope with wheelchair and carer. All the usual griprails. Red cord available.
593,"There are two disabled spaces right next to the door. I’ve never had a problem grabbing one at any time of day. 
If you don’t have a blue badge, there are about 4 spaces near the door and a bigger car park just over the road, all on the flat."
594,It's a bit out of the way in Lee Valley area. We went by train then tube to Stratford Underground station which is a bit convoluted in terms of getting from Jubilee line to exit (poor signposting we thought and several lifts to navigate). There's no parking at the venue for events.  In normal circumstances it's a 20 minute push/walk from tube to velodrome - however West Ham were at home nearby so routes near Westfield were closed off and it took much much further. The organisers had een fit to include flights of stairs on their diversions so we had to go it's alone to find stepfree routes - very poor!
595,"Not great. There is a small lip into the venue, and double doors. The doors are wide, but not automatic. Once inside, half of the restaurant is up a set of stairs, and the seats downstairs are mostly built into the window which isn't ideal if you are using a wheelchair. The bar is high with no dropped counter. Lighting is good for a bar however."
596,The staff members at the Centraal Museum are very helpful and accommodating and can assist you when needed.
597,"Staff very friendly and chatty, happy to recommend nearby places."
598,"The toilets were pretty cramped, and basic.  It is accessed using a radar key and the emergency pull cord was tied up. Also, the walkway to the toilets was  not in good condition and had been stuck down in places with hazard tape."
599,With 15 disabled spaces spread on either side of the entrance and also immediately opposite it could not be better.
600,"The accessible toilet was on the ground floor, near Reception.  Can't remember about signage but I asked helpful, pleasant Reception staff
"
601,Once I got a wheelchair access is ok up to the gate other than having to get my shoes off and on without nearly falling of the chair.
602,There is one disabled toilet available however it does not have any changing facilities available or national key toilets. 
603,"There is only on-street parking available on the High St. which can be very busy at times, however, there is a nearby car-park with disabled spaces.  We visited in the evening so availability could vary."
604,"Excellent disabled access, plenty of signs written nice and large. 1 accessible lift. Plenty of seating. I notice 4 ? security staff on site and one  offering assistance."
605,"As a wheelchair user I am very happy with the ease of movement around the site, the restaurants and the activities areas. All staff that I have had contact with are very switched on to my needs."
606,"We booked all three cottages for a family get together, which included our disabled father who is in a wheelchair and 5 dogs!  We could not have asked for more - the cottages met all our needs and the disabled facilities were outstanding, including height adjustable worktops and sink. Edward and Marion were keen to make sure everything was ok and full of useful information.  We will definitely be booking again."
607,All staff that I interacted with were very friendly and helpful. My friends son was with us and a staff member game him an activity sheet to keep him occupied without us asking.
608,It's clean. spacious enough and just around the corner from the main seating area.
609,Easy access to a single small loo
610,"Good parking, quite a number of disabled parking spaces."
611,Wheelchair accessible. 
612,"Friendly, helpful and went above and beyond  to make me feel safe and reassured."
613,There is plenty of on street parking across the road on Military Road.
614,"Plenty of choice on menu , accessible, lovely decor and friendly staff"
615,"There were a good few steps at the front and I had read that the incline of the portable ramp made it tricky for some wheelchair users to get up it. Not so for my wife, her powerchair made quite easy work of it, although it is a bit of a beast."
616,Good toilet but you have to ask for the key at the bar
617,"Friendly and helpful enough, no complaints at all."
618,We made a family trip in the summer to the maritime museum in Irvine and puffer’s cafe next door. The maritime museum has a car park with disabled parking spaces and is within walking distance of puffer’s Cafe beside the harbour.
619,"The Town Hall Keeper, Dave is unfailingly helpful, he turns up at the end of an event to conduct us to the lift, and points out if there is a delay, and ensures refreshment staff at the bar are available. He is hospitable and patient and makes every visit to the Literature Festival a real pleasure because we know there won't be any issues with our visit. The Literature Festival welcomers are aso unfailingly helpful and are active in helping any disabled visitor to be comfortable. "
620,"A handy train station in Larbert linking up Stirling with Glasgow and Edinburgh. Slower trains than the main Edinburgh to Glasgow line, but all journeys well under an hour. Good ramped access and decent parking at this station."
621,"The doors of the centre are automatic so no fighting with heavy doors! There are clear signs to the lift and the toilets, if you struggle to see or need a hand with the doors there is a main reception that is always manned and the staff are always happy to assist.
In the Aquatics Centre there is a small cafe to your left with plenty seats if you need to take a break."
622,"All along the promenade is level and there is a cafe which is also level and serves good coffee. The pier is all level and the funicular railway is wheelchair friendly. Heartily recommend the Seaview Restaurant which has seating downstairs and a lift takes you up to the upstairs, which has accessible seating inside or - highly recommended - outside on the terrace with amazing views. The fish and chips there are absolutely excellent!"
623,The wet room in the double bedroom was very good.  There was enough room for the camode/shower chair to go over the wc with plenty of room for the pa to work   
624,Small museum in the High Street above Pizza Express.
625,When we arrived our travel agent had failed to inform the airline that we would require assistance. This was sorted quickly and with as little stress as possible! The guys that meet us at the gate were very friendly and cracking jokes. All in all very impressed.
626,The few I did meet were knowledgeable and nice.
627,Accessible toilet on main concourse. Helpful staff who will get the door for you.
628,"The wood is down a single track road. Parking is on the side of the road but there is ample space, even when busy. However, cars park close together and there are not marked spaces so you may struggle to have enough room if you need to get a wheelchair etc out of the boot. "
629,Travelled by taxi which parked and collected me from directly outside the hotel. Unable to comment on public transport but I don't think there was a direct bus from the hotel to where my conference was being held.
630,Having browsed around the many Festival Hot Spots the Mound felt like the centre.  May be something to do with having watched Sunshine on Leith recently!
631,"The accessible toilet was well sign posted, easy to find.  On the same level as the Restaurant. Grab rails, clean and tidy.  Had room to manoeuvre with walking frame. Only issue is it feels a fair distance to get to depending on where you are sitting in the Restaurant.
Also accessibility toilets right at the entrance to the gardens, without the dreaded baby changing facilities.  Easy assess for wheelchairs with room to move."
632,"What a delightful hotel to hold our anniversary, it’s classy, inviting, beautifully decorated throughout, historically interesting, and beautiful gardens all around the hotel. For a full report, we encourage you to read all three reviews, along with 60 photos we have for you to help you see why we booked this hotel for a special day.
If you enjoy good food, well presented, and served by caring staff, then please do go along for an afternoon visit at least.

We spent the day here, taking in lunch, before our overnight stay, and then somehow found room for a three course dinner later on, rather silly, as we were then so full, we missed breakfast the next morning as we just had no room left for more food. It would have been great when in our younger days, but as older people 
we do not eat as much as we used to

Our review starts with photo of NutHurst Grange hotel (photo 1), and we entered the reception (photo 2) and kindly escorted to the Orangery restaurant for our three course lunch (photo 3) with delicious warm homemade rolls and a glass of wine each (photo 4). Our meal was served by Peter our waiter (photo 5)
We retired into the delightful lounge (photo 6) and simply relaxed as evening drew close (photo 7) while a warm glow settled over the hotel as twilight arrived (photo 8).

We returned to our ground floor disabled room, (photo 9) to view our comfortable bed (photo 10) in a very spacious, minimalistic furnished room (photo 11). Then the bathroom, wow ! Beautifully tiled in light grey warm looking tiles (photo 12) with a heated towel rail, walk in shower, a deep bath,with an emergency telephone ready by the shower cubicle. One of the best bathrooms we have seen. (photo 13).

Dressed and ready for dinner, we entered the lounge and settled in for the evening (photo 14) for a pre-dinner Sherry, served by our pleasant Head waiter (photo 15) 
who then escorted us to the Kingswood restaurant (photo 16) an elegant, beautifully furnished and decorative room (photo 17) and thoroughly enjoyed another three course dinner (photo 18). And the evening came to a conclusion with the staff and fellow guest congratulating us on our 59th wedding anniversary.

Our final thoughts
If you choose to have a special day here, you will really be looked after, with 
excellent menus served by attentive and friendly staff, and what they put in front of you will be a treat.
So don’t forget to read all three parts of the reviews for this lovely hotel."
633,Taking a stroll (a wheel) along George Street the door was open and accessible so time to explore.
634,"This is the first time I have used the café since becoming disabled. The regular toilets are downstairs so I asked where their accessible toilet was. I was directed to the main building and from there saw a sign to the disabled toilets. While the route was step free it involved walking along a corridor to the entrance of the cathedral. The toilet requires a radar key. The accessible toilet was clean, spacious, there's grab rails, an emergency code which almost reached to the ground. There was also a fold down baby changing table.  I didn't realise until I came home and looked in their online copy of Access for People with Special Needs that there is a second toilet, accessible by lift, which may or may not have been nearer."
635,"Decent size of disabled toilet, which I could use from my powerchair. Some people who need a side transfer might find difficulties, because there is only space available on one side to transfer to the toilet. The bin does not have a lid, so everyone can see what you are throwing in it, which might be a concern for some people, especially when they have throw incontinence materials away."
636,"There is parking immediately in front of the store. Although there are a few spaces, the surface is gravel which can be a little tricky to negotiate. There are no designated accessible bays."
637,The decor and ambience of Dry Dock is really nice! The staff is friendly too. 
638,"Wet room with grab handles, adjustable shower. shower seat as requested on booking. Toilet which had a raised seat and grab bars."
639,"Up a steep hill from the ferry terminal. Paths round the abbey uneven with some potholes. Inside the Abbey church is wheelchair accessible from the cloisters but only on the main level. No step-free access to choir or majority of areas in the building. 
Description provided is pretty accurate.
There are no toilets in the Community Shop at the moment, so use the public toilets by the Ferry in the village before you climb the hill to the Abbey."
640,The shopping centre has its own multi-storey car park with 28 disabled available which is located on high street.  Shudehill interchange is the nearest metro link and bus stop to the centre and the nearest train station is Manchester Victoria both a five minute walk or less to the centre.
641,"Well trained, helpful staff."
642,"This restaurant is a new venture and they have a lovely bright and clean venue with lovely views over the hills.  The menu is varied and we opted for the tapas to share - generous portions and delicious flavours.  They now have a license for alcohol so a glass of rose was on the cards.  The cakes on offer are all freshly baked on the premises and they did not disappoint.
All in all a lovely experience - thought I was going to a cafe but turns out its a bona fide restaurant!"
643,"Easy to enter from shopping centre. Good service, signage and accessible toilet. "
644,"Toilet is located within the leisure centre , there are no facilities along the towpath. "
645,Busy but helpful
646,I've been here many times doing everything from holding a quiz to attending a quiz to attend a political meeting this week. The institute has just had a majoir refurbisment so it as a ramp now and new disabled toilets.
647,The entrance is via the car park area there are both steps and a ramp available . The door opens outward's and is of a good width. There are a second set of double doors. There is a ramp from this door to the reception area. The restaurant has two levels and wheelchairs would need to be kept in this area.
648,Staff were extremely attentive and accommodating
649,Staff were excellent throughout. They were friendly and helpful. Service was attentive but not intrusive. When we were ready to leave we asked the staff and they telephoned for a taxi for us and then kept a look out and informed us when our taxi arrived.
650,"The staff were extremely helpful throughout my visit. Whether it was opening the doors, helping with the food or taking my order, they were always more than happy to help!"
651,"No steps, level entrance, automatic doors. Easy push for my husband. He went in first and went into WH Smiths to say I needed a chair.  The staff member scurried off to find it (unfortunately there is only one and it was on the northbound side but bless them, they went and got it). Husband was entrusted with the chair for duration of our visit. I've sat in some tatty borrowed chairs but this one wasn't bad!"
652,3 disabled parking spaced directly in front of restaurant with plenty of space
653,Sara was lovely & incredibly helpful. We only wish we stayed longer!
654,"Generally in Shrewsbury;acces is ok, with the exception of some shops that don’t seem to want to obtain simple solutions like an access ramp to let wheelchair users in to their premises "
655,Brilliant Norman Keep but unless you can climb loads of steps (and I mean loads) this is not worth a visit really. Viisitor Centre fairly limited and no cafe plus parking is private and charged unlike most English Heritage sites. 
656,"There is no parking in closest proximity, but the buses stop just outside the cafe."
657,"This is a specialist holiday place in the UK for people with autsin/send and other disabilities. 
It is amazing, there is a huge pool that everyone can use on their own for an hour every day. The park is accessible and the Forrest is wheelchair accessible. 
The grounds are all flat and great for anyone with a disability. 
The houses are beautiful and 5*"
658,"My first experience of a bunkhouse has got me really excited and raring to try out other bunkhouses. I just hope that I haven’t been spoilt!
We recently had a short break at the Coll Bunkhouse on the beautiful Isle of Coll. On arrival we were met by a very friendly, helpful lady who showed us around the accommodation. It was all totally wheelchair accessible, clean and bright.
 Our room consisted of one set of bunks and a single bed. There was also an accessible sink in the room. There was plenty of space to manoeuvre. The only problem I encountered during my stay were the fire doors. I found them very heavy and could not push myself and hold the door open at the same time. Thankfully my companion was always on hand.
There was a designated wheelchair accessible bathroom with grab rails and a roll in shower with two wall mounted shower seats. The toilet was a perfect height for me to be able to slide transfer.
While there we made use of the books available. Wild flowers of Coll and Tiree was particularly useful. We spent a whole day wandering around the Island seeing how many plants we could identify. 
There is no public transport on Coll and we didn’t have any transport of our own, preferring to walk or in my case roll around the Island. The weather wasn’t very good at times however a local lady who had seen us out walking and looking rather wet arrived in an accessible car to offer us a lift back to the bunkhouse. We declined the generous offer and I am so glad that we did as we actually managed to get a photograph of a great yellow bumblebee which we later got confirmed by the Bumblebee Conservation Trust. We celebrated with knickerbocker glories at the Island Café, Arinagour. Yum!  
Everything about our stay on Coll was perfect, the Bunkhouse, the scenery and the people."
659,"Wheelchair accessible, very helpful friendly staff, I emailed before hand and the staff gave me lots of useful information. There are two entrances, one with steps, one without, I was directed to the non step entrance"
660,"Moat House lives entirely up to the description on its website. It is brilliantly adapted for even the most disabled people and it sets a standard we have not come across before. We recommend it without reservation of any kind. Highlights of our stay included walking and taking an all-terrain buggy across the sands at Powfoot (but beware the incoming tides), visiting Dumfries to renew childhood memories, walking in the forest of Ae, visiting the Wetland Centre at Caelaverock and the Runic Cross at Ruthwell, going to the splendid small cinema to see live opera from Rome. We did not feel the need to eat out as we so enjoyed sitting as a family eating round the splendid table in the huge kitchen., but we did succumb at lunchtime one day to delicious fish and chips from the Cafe Royal. Our one regret was that the weather did not allow us to use the splendid barbecue facilities on the terrace. All in all a memorable holiday."
661,"There's very little accessible public transport in the vicinity. Bus routes 44, 137 and 452 will drop you off at the Chelsea Gate of the park. I don't know about parking."
662,"Staff were really helpful and keen to answer my questions about accessibility. The manager, Anna, is very keen to ensure that all guests get a pleasant experience."
663,Most of the time access is blocked to the disabled parking bay.
664,"Central Oxford is well-served by buses and the railway station, which is fully step-free, is less than a mile away.

I don't know about parking in Oxford."
665,Plenty of disabled parking available near the entrance and regularly checked by the staff
666,Access from rear of venue.  Door was held open but would benefit from having a doorbell incase the door isn't open or any assistance is required.  Unfortunately I was put into a back area and felt a little excluded and that I was putting the staff out a bit.  It was quite early in the morning and they had not long opened.  I was there as part of Disabled Access Day and the lady who saw me initially didn't seem to know anything about why I was there.
667,"On a sunday depending whether there is the Highland dancing or not on over at the hall, there are literally no places to park it's that busy because of the event on over at the hall."
668,With a spirit of adventure you pass along the single track roads to arrive at a tree circled clearing where the Clava Cairns stand grey and intriguing. Not the most wheelchair accessible perhaps but curiosity was a strong enough draw to roll across the undulating turn to take a closer look.
669,There was step free access throughout.
670,"Level access, automatic doors, ramps and slopes."
671,"While there are quite a few disabled parking spots these filled up very quickly making parking difficult. Staff at reception however found us somewhere to park until a space became available and did try to help out with this. 
 There is public transport to the city (bus) from very near the hotel which can be used. We also saw quite a few wheelchair accessible taxis in the area and the reception staff had information on these."
672,We went by private car.  Car park was ample .. But there weren't many visitors today.  Car park surface is loose stones/chippings
673,The disabled access is round the side and the theatre staff were amazing at taking us round and clearing the crowds and helping us to our seats.
674,"Very central location, just outside Castle Walls, and with level access (though far too many cobbles) to the Castle and Cathedral.
Disabled parking directly outside the door of the accessible room.
Fully accessible room on ground floor, with access to hotel reception and dining room via step free (though sloping) outdoor path.
Wet room with fixed seat in the shower, grab rails and non-slip floor.  The wet room is good, but not entirely well thought out.  The shower seat is too low.  The only mirror is above and to the side of the toilet, rather than above the basin, so no good for shaving, and cannot be seen by anyone in a wheelchair or who cannot stand for long.  There was no hot water in the basin, and the kettle provided for tea making could not fit in the basin to be filled.
The bed(s) are slightly raised, so easy to get out of.  There is the option of a large double or 2 twin beds.  We had the double, and it was very comfortable.
We just stayed the one night and it was very good for what we needed"
675,Level access entryway into the shopping centre and level access to each shop.
676,There are 5 disabled parking spaces near the entrance. Two of these had no additional space at the sides and there wasn’t much room. The car park is quite stony and there is gravel which made it quite difficult to self propel my wheelchair. 
677,Parking available in  nearby centre car park. Buses nearby.
678,"Wheelchair access is at the right hand side of the main entrance. Staff were very helpful indeed, and came out to show us how to get in."
679,There were changing place toilets 
680,"for a shopping centre, it is one of the best that I have visited. The shops arealso generally fullyaccessible as all the restaurants. There is even a spa which I believe is accessible also. We public areas are kept very clean and hazard free."
681,"Perfect parking, just outside the door of the cottage, so easy to load/unload. "
682,on Street parking but very busy
683,"The entrance is flat, the tills when I visited had a decent queue set up with good space to manoeuvre to, and there is a lift to the screens and galleries on the upper floor. There are disabled toilet too. 
There are boards and staff to inform you where you need to go, but I've not got much experience with them. According to the website, headphones for audio description are available on request. "
684,"Well set out, though a very wet floor around the toilet which made me nervous of sliding.  Also the baby changing area was a whole bench top which took up a lot of floor space as it wasn't folding."
685,Friendly and accomodating.
686,"A ten minute walk from the luas, not much nearby parking."
687,"Saint Spyridon is the patron saint of Corfu and his remains are house in the church. The church dates from the late 1500s and is in a Venetian style of architecture. The church is ornately decorated, but photos not permitted inside."
688,"All the paths in the vicinity are accessible - although some are bumpy or stony.
(I did it in m powerchair without much bother!)
Level access to and in Visitor Centre."
689,An accessible toilet is adjacent to the main toilets in the centre of the park. Near to the Marlborough Gate entrance accessible toilet is accessed using a RADAR key.
690,Very good access to the front of the station and the platforms with easy to read electronic signs. Also good clear signposting to platforms.
691,Spacious with suitable rails and a red cord that reached the floor. Bin may need to be pushed aside for transfer but there’s space for that.
692,Easy to find.
693,"Parking immediately outside and lots of buses nearby, including the very frequent 26."
694,Very good though did have to ask for a couple of high chairs to be moved to gain access.
695,"If you are looking for somewhere to stay that has easy access but is still a quaint old pub, this is the place.  The staff were amazingly helpful and the room was so close to both the disabled parking and the pub.  The wet room was perfect and they even supplied a doorstop - which is a bugbear of mine in most hotels.  No longer will I be thinking I can only get easy access in large hotels!"
696,There are no step-free stations nearby. Several bus routes run up and down Moorgate and stop very near the shop.
697,"Yes there is an accessibility loo, however you need to know where to look for the toilets on the first floor, and need to negotiate the display units to get there."
698,"London Bridge Station is nearby and has step-free access to both Northern and Jubilee Lines, but check before you travel because the lifts are damned unreliable and often out of service for months at a time. Several bus routes pass up and down nearby Borough High St. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area."
699,"From the moment of arrival, staff are very helpful and respectful. A member of staff will accompany guests to the room with bags and check that everything that is needed is in place and then another staff member will ring shortly afterwards asking if they can help with any extra equipment, much of it free, such as a kettle, extra cutlery, a fan. Nothing seems too much trouble. One day each week guests are also invited to a cocktail party and very senior staff are present, very welcoming and happy to offer suggestions, advice or help on accessible venues to visit."
700,staff very helpful always looking for ways to assist you when in store
701,"Staff were very nice, helpful & accomodating. Nothing was too much bother. "
702,Staff always lovely and very patient. 
703,"No stairs to tackle, lifts"
704,"ramped access into the property and a thorough floor lift makes both levels accessible,  There is plenty of room for wheelchair users to get about "
705,"Two minute walk from a few bus stops from St Andrew Square, plus the tram stop. Also a few minute walk from Princess  Street and Queen Street."
706,Once in the Sculpture Garden getting around was easy as the paths are all hard surfaced and easy to wheel around. The sculptures are set out on the different grass areas and it is easy to wheel up and see each one at first-hand. There were plenty of seats if you wanted to take time out and rest a while. The gardens were beautiful and full of colour with the spring plants.
707,"Access into the courtyard requires going across some cobbles. Once in the area the various galleries and eating places each have their own access arrangements. The winter ice rink has a view area where people can sit, a lounge, and the skate area; all of which are accessible."
708,"There is a disabled toilet and a cafe in Register House, which is wheelchair accessible."
709,Several bus routes will drop you off nearby but there are no step-free stations in the vicinity.
710,"A lovely rural and rustic pub/restaurant, part of the Vintage Inn Group, with good disabled access. "
711,I used the accessible toilet which is at the top of the ramp to 056. It was big enough for myself and a carer. RADAR key is required to get in - every staff member has one on their belt. The red cord touches the floor and handrails are on both sides.
712,A return visit as I enjoyed the experience last time.  I would of given a rating of 4.75.  The only problem is with a lip at the entrance which may make it difficult for electric wheelchairs.  Really enjoyed this visit.  Felt really safe as the staff were Covid compliant.  
713,Has to be as there is a wonderful Changing Place Toilet available this is located in the main exhibition hall area and is on your left hand side as you enter the hall.
714,In a corridor with open doorway opposite. Fine to get into and out of but the link area is often busy and there are lots of prams  parked.
715,Easy to find way into station and to locate the ticket office. Finding the platform once the train was announced was straightforward.
716,"Although there is an outside  plant area as well as indoor plants & garden sundries, this is a really good place for buying good quality gifts, kitchen ware, good quality foods & so on. Two excellent cafes; Theatre Cafe on the ground floor & the Tree Tops Cafe on the lift accessible first floor. 
Very disabled friendly, with no steps. Plenty of Blue Badge parking by the main entrance, with plenty of aisle space  "
717,"Accessible toilet down in basement, unfortunately I never went"
718,"There is a clear walkway to the toilet, however, this is not very wide and can make it difficult during busy periods. There are only two toilets available and these sometimes are not as clean as they could be."
719,The staff we spoke to in  the shop were very nice
720,easy parking space
721,"On street parking in front of the property. We actually parked fully on the pavement, giving sufficient space to lower wheelchair ramp at rear of vehicle. This gives direct access to front door immediately beside. Small / gentle concrete incline to front door. Unfortunately their is a small lip to negotiate at the fresh hold of the door and we found it easier going in backwards than forwards. Once inside the property all areas fully accessible on wooden floors."
722,All doors were wide enough for my large electric wheelchair. It was level access from my car to the log cabin. 
723,"We couldn't find the accessible loo. Needing the toilet for me means I have to go right away and it not being signposted I had to go into the womens toilets, I had to get my daughter to stand at the door because once you are in the cubicle there is no room to shut the door"
724,"A lovely little cafe open to the general public attached to the hospice. Disabled parking spaces, ramp access and wide automatic door into the venue.
Inside access to the seating area and servery is spacious. Only one toilet for all customers including disabled.
Food is lovely, a good variety, excellent quality and polite staff. One to go back to. "
725,Outstanding staff with nurses on call 24/7. Outstanding customer care.
726,"everywhere fully accessible.  Lifts to all floors, and in the dining room (waiter operated, but always a friendly waiter on hand)
Entrance door with button for opening"
727,Didn't use the restroom but it was clearly labelled and visible. 
728,"I've love this theatre ever seeing Miss Jean Brodie 15 years ago when moving to Edinburgh.

I was interested in seeing an accessible performance as from the outset the building is full of narrow steps.

Myself and a friend went along to experience Rhinoceros as part of the Edinburgh International Festival, a hour before the performance we took part in the touch tour and during the performance my friend used the Audio Described headphones, which we both loved.
"
729,The toilets are located towards the rear of the restaurant with and uneven entry to the toilet. The toilet is unisex and not for the sole use of disabled people. There is manoeuvring space enough for a wheelchair and there are transfer rails and support bars present. Also the toilet has an emergency alarm. The tap uses lever and it mixes both hot and cold water and an automatic hand dryer is available.
730,Helpful. English not as good as other cities on Black Sea but enough to get by. 
731,"On street disabled parking in the Crescent is free to blue-badge holders, as are most of the Pay and Display car parks in Buxton.  If you are lucky you can park on the street behind the restaurant (by the Old Courthouse shops)for a shorter distance to travel.  Both parking options involve going over uneven terrain to get into the restaurant."
732,"Main walk was a good quality path which was accessible along its entirety, a hide which had just a tiny lip to get over and a space inside to sit in your chair. Lots of children's activities enroute, some of which you can access. The visitors center has ramped access but the shop is very tight. Staff happy to move things but shame to have to ask."
733,helpful and pleasant
734,The staff are very friendly and helpful.
735,"We only found public ladies and gents, with small cubicles, no sign for disabled.
 "
736,"- Some doors are automatic but most of the doors you have to push/pull to open
- The handles on doors are lower down so possible to open in a wheelchair 
- The building is easy to access In a wheelchair as all flat with lifts 
- They have lifts to get up and down the stairs "
737,"There are disabled bays outside the store they are wide but they don't have very clear markings.

Several buses run near the store and there are pedestrian crossings. "
738,The car park (which goes up to £6 all day or £13 with the evening) is about a five minute walk when you include inside the car park and going around the building. There is good provision of Disabled Access spaces.
739,Although the tearoom is easily accessible for everyone - if you would like to walk around the forestry centre you may find it extremely difficult many of the paths are made from mud so become slippy and uneven.
740,"The nearest tube stations are Leicester Square and Charing Cross, neither of which are step free. Nearest step free  tube stations are Green Park or Westminster. There are several bus routes that stop close by. "
741,Most were helpful and friendly.
742,The staff are super friendly and great at offering assistance with either drink orders or even offering to assist with picking music from the jukebox. 
743,"All staff and volunteers were friendly and offered specific advice on access, routes etc.  The lady on duty inside the building saw that my family had left me outside while they went in and she came out specifically to check I was ok and to see if she could tell me anything , and was I finding the access ok."
744,There are two staff on reception who can provide information and assistance. They have always been really helpful and friendly. They go the extra mile to help others especially with accessibility issues
745,Staff are friendly and seem happy to help. They are always quite busy however!
746,Easy to find accessible toilet; very large with hand rails
747,"This corner accessible WC was good for most users having a good mirror and colour contrasting toilet seat, but there were some obvious omissions or mistakes:
- door signage was weak and should have been clearer with recognition for people with dementia
- the door closer was a little heavy
- the flush handle was not to the centre of the room
- there wasn't a colostomy shelf, but we were advised that this was being fitted
- the walls were reflective as opposed to being contrasting with the rest of the fittings
- all guardrails were bright chrome which gave the room a modern look at the expense of functionality (plastic fluted and colour contrasted is advisable)"
748,Loads of buses and taxis pass along Old Street and there's a tube station not too far away (not wheelchair accessible at the time of writing).
749,There is an entrance on either side of the building (if you park or come by bus). It’s all level access throughout and no music plays in the store so I did not feel distracted or flustered.
750,"Toilets within the complex are well sign posted and easy to find.
Disabled toilets have enough room to manoeuvre, are very clean and have grab rails to provide support."
751,"Level access entrance. But once inside it is on different levels. Accessible via ramp which was quite steep and partially via a lift that is key controlled, so to get to the gym area upstairs you must ask reception for a key to access the lift. The gym area was busy with a lot of machines but seemed that only a few were accessible. It was good that they had a handcycle machine. With all the treadmills/running machines they had it would have been good if they had a wheelchair roller/treadmill. Not sure why more gyms don’t have them tbh.
The dry side accessible changing area was a decent size and had a changing bed but there was no hoist. The pool area was really good and had a steam room that was accessible. The wetside accessible changing area was a similar size but didn’t have a changing bed in it. 
The cafe area was spacious and the staff were extremely helpful moving chairs for the wheelchair to get in."
752,Just wonderful! Had obviously had some good staff training... An old fashioned and genuine Glasgow welcome!
753,"Park in car park, which has fine gravel over which a wheelchair can be pushed or pulled a short distance before level, paved paths."
754,Great service station with lovely grounds - makes a change from the usual view of the motorway
755,"We arrived by car,but there is a public bus service drops off at the road end, a good 3/4 mile away, however the hotel picks up walkers and hikers,and transports them and luggage to next drop off points on West Highland Way, so it may be possible to arrange being met at the road end.
 Several Dedicated  disabled parking near entrance to hotel. Might still be a 
bit far for those with mobility restrictions. Slight slope to negotiate down to main door. 
"
756,"There is one disabled parking space and one other at the door but lots of local roadside parking available.
Public transport available close-by, bus stop at end of street and railway station (Paisley Gilmour Street) within half a mile."
757,"Available throught site, clearly matked and all well maintained. Some invluded changing area."
758,"Lucas are a family run business, so there is the essential focus on families. Very friendly and welcoming."
759,"Very nice and happy, there was a major three day festival on the hotel was really busy but they coped well."
760,The disabled access at Heathrow airport is pretty good as it's very spacious and has lots of signs for us to get to know where we are. However I was not allowed to take my electric chair to the gate when I was told at the start of my journey so I had to use one of the airports chairs
761,Ample both in Room 16 and in pub/restaurant 
762,We travelled by private car.  There were lots of disabled parking spaces.  
763,Accessible toilets on all floors.
764,There are a few wheelchair accessible spaces and space can be tight if trying to leave when everyone else is.
765,"The staff are very welcoming & friendly. No one was phased by the wheelchair, & the staff spoke to both me & my husband. No one was condescending or patronising, & one waiter in particular went out of their way to be inclusive."
766,"There are 3 concert rooms within the easily accessed building, and a lift to all floors. I was in the basement auditorium which had a ramped walkway to bar area, & disabled toilets. There's also a disabled toilet next to the box office information desk in main foyer.
No problems at all!!"
767,Dedicated disabled parking with direct flat access.
768,"Accessible bathroom in the room,plenty of room for wheelchair and walking frame. However there was a bath , which although it had rails around it, was inaccessible to me"
769,all paths are concrete and well maintained
770,When I visited the staff were very friendly and helpful.
771,Just one step
772,There's two different entrances so make sure you enter via the step free one on Ingram Street. There is a very funky lift to take you to other floors. It's an old building with fabulous history that has been made accessible so expect a couple of quirky corners etc. dining room upstairs fantastic atmosphere and can rearrange furniture to meet your needs.
773,The staff were nice and very helpful.
774,Car parking is on street but some bays are very near venue and free for blue badge holders.
775,"There is a council run car park next to Marine House. One disabled space. The owner has an agreement with the council that residents can use the car park free of charge. The disabled space us marked, wide and paved.

The rest of the car park is gravel - which might prove a challenge for wheelchairs and some scooters. 

From the car park to the hotel entrance is maybe 50m 

There is double yellow lines outside the hotel. So on with a blue badge?"
776,A very accessible family pub that does good food with standard disabled facilities.
777,"Signage excellent as with most major airports, no lifts all ramp access, "
778,Once you're at the tattoo and past the 100m hill it's well thought out. There is wheelchair accessible seating right at the front of the stands which I imagine gets you right into the heart of the action! We sat in stands & there can be lots of steps depending on your row. They are fairly steep but do have a rail / bannister on both sides so that you can hold on to that and there is room for a person to hold onto on your other side. If it was wet then you'd have to be doubly careful as would be slippy.
779,Very good disabled toilet facilities.
780,"Toilets were large and perfect for their purpose, they were spacious and very clean, however they weren't at the front of the shop so maybe weren't so obvious to where they were"
781,Parking close to store entry and lift 
782,"Too many steps really, though I did see internal lift but it is not sign posted when you go in."
783,You can drive up to your cottage to load/unload then your car stays in the carpark a very short distance just round the corner. This keeps the courtyard area that the cottages open on to safer and quieter.
784,"The only reason for 2 stars only, is because of the difficulty to get to the Spa building, but otherwise it is a very lovely place to take advantage of this quiet Spa and pool building. Sadly the Spa is not disabled friendly unless you can manage a longish walk along a path of chippings,  as pushing a wheelchair would be very difficult, but we include the review here which may benefit your family members while visiting this lovely old medieval hotel.

The Spa is set in its own area, situated in enchanting gardens and delightful pools, and 26 acres of woodland walks and pasture land. With its modern facilities of a large swimming pool, sauna, hot tub, steam room, and modern Gym, it still manages to hold its charm and elegance, and blends in well with the medieval hotel itself, which is surrounded by open spaces and woodland walks, first introduced as a hunting lodge in the 13th century, now with 26 acres for you to wander through, taking along your canine companion in this dog friendly hotel.

A delightful well maintained Moat surrounds this hotel (photo 1) and a paved pathway from the car park, (photo 2) leads towards the hotels main entrance, (photo 3) which is on the flat, then a double door awaits you to pull open.
This leads you to the hotel reception, and a hallway (photo 4) which will lead to the separate Spa building.  The path crosses the moat (photo 5).  
After going out of the hotel, you have to go down half a dozen steps (photo 6)  and there is no ramp available, and a long hard slog would await the carer to pull you over the deep chippings. Sadly, even though the Spa is set in beautiful settings and a lovely old building, (photo 7) we cannot recommend this for disabled people. 
For an able bodied companion, there is a very attractive large swimming pool available (photo 8) and a hot tub., as well as a sauna.
The Gym has a good selection of equipment including weights (photo 9) and treadmills (photo 10).
To cool off after your training, there are delightful woodland walks (photo 11) passing many lovely pools, which lead to pasture lands (photo 12).

Our final thoughts
Sadly, not for a disabled person, as far to difficult to reach the Spa and pool, steep steps, heavy going dragging you across chippings that pass a lovely little pond, nicely laid out area, and wonderful woodland walks.  So we cannot in any way recommend the Spa to you. (BUT DO SEE OUR REVIEW OF NEW HALL HOTEL AS THIS IS A DELIGHTFUL HOTEL IN ITSELF)


"
785,"Moorland Nature Reserve is a small but beautiful wood near York. Accessible to wheelchairs and small mobility scooter. 
Visiting in the spring is highly recommended when the hundreds of Rhododendrons  are in flower. The colours are quite breathtaking. Its is a pleasant place for a family walk at anytime of year and is enjoyed by children. 
It does not take very long to walk around but there is plenty to interest for an hour or so.  "
786,"On arrival we asked at cash desk if it was accessible, we was told yes but they were unsure if tractor ride was. First problem we had was gravel uneven path, Dylan who is strong manual chair user needed help from me. Next stop was food at kernel kitchen situated outside. Couldn't access the order area as step up. We left Dylan at bottom and ordered food. The seating was all picnic benches which we couldn't get wheelchair under. We then tackled some mazes, all accessible. Then to major disappointment Dylan couldn't access any of all the other lovely stuff. Remote control boats, mural painting, maze of confusion, tractor ride etc as they all needed accessing via wooden stepped platform. None had ramps. Due Dylan being very upset we ended up leaving after 1hr 45 mins there and spending £39.50 to get in. That cost was for 1adult & 2 kids."
787,The accessible loo is easy to find as it’s right near the woman and men’s toilets. 
788,Level access and the bus station is all in one level. Clear signage and markings. And a good wee cafe!
789,Awkward.  No lift between sections required leaving the building and entering through a fire exit - with a too steep ramp.  
790,"In the basement, which is accessible by lift, there are 2 accessible toilets, labelled handicapes. The accesible toilet was clean and spacious with a single grab rail and no emergency alarm."
791,"I wouldn't want to put anyone off visiting as the Creative Café is a lovely place, I just think a couple of little touches could make it even more accessible for people, and that's why I have given it this rating.

There is a small step to the main door, this is a double door which can be opened widely. 
There is also a side door (which isn't used so much) this also requires you to step up to go in, and is a narrower single door.

If you have good mobility there is no problem at all. If using a manual chair, you could probably be assisted to get over the step in your chair. However, with a powerchair, or scooter this would be difficult.
A small ramp here would make all the difference and is easy to do (we took our own ramp with us).

You go through the shop when you first enter, this is wide with plenty of room to move round.
You then go into the Creative and Café area, this was also big enough to move around in -although the layout of the tables does get changed around sometimes depending on the number of people/workshops going on.

"
792,There are 2 accessible toilets  fitted with grab rails near the restaurant and bar.
793,"Heres a bit of a pill because being London, like down the road from kings cross, it is a major road. I went both times in a taxi and have either had to cross the road to get to the venue or be dropped off at fire exit type door and go all the way round. Which when there is a queue round the building can be a bit slow."
794,The accessible toilet in the main building is situated next to the stairs leading to the first floor. The toilet in the grounds can be found next to 'cafe tees'. 
795,"Helpful staff, will open the room if not already unlocked on request. "
796,"The access into the restaurant was a dream with large doors and just one right angle corner to navigate and one tiny 2 inch wide ramp from the street. All of this was much larger than your usual doorway so turning was not a problem. Food was fantastic, service great they allowed extra time for our orders and were more than happy to move tables to provide us with more room. We didn't use the disabled toilet but it was large and clean with really easy access. The only issue we had was getting onto the pavement to get into the restaurant, there isn't a drop curb directly outside so you have to navigate the quite narrow pavement about 4 metres up the road. We did this is my mums much larger than average customed electric wheelchair so it is manageable. This was something I didn't notice when I scoped it out before our visit. Overall I would visit again especially if your a pizza lover like mum and I. "
797,"Very helpful and polite staff, what more can you say?"
798,"There is on street car parking directly in front of the bakers and more parking just around the corner. On busy days, it might be difficult to get parked here, but there is a pay and display car park in the area which is free for blue badge holders. "
799,Parking on site.  Best to access by car as rural setting means public transport will be infrequent.
800,A council run sports centre that is easy to access by all and facilities a number of groups that are specific to individuals with disibility. 
801,Fully wheelchair accessible bar.  Garden overlooks Priory ruins and is very pleasant.  Accessible loo inside. Not a huge menu but plenty of choice including veggie options. Food restricted to set times eg lunch 12 - 2. Food was good.
802,On Saturday 9th November 2019 both myself and my dad went to watch Blackpool FC  away at Morecambe FC in the FA Cup this was a fantastic day out we were freezing when we left the football stadium as we both could not feel our feet.
803,Helpful front of house
804,This venue doesn't have parking but there is a park and ride that stops at exhibition square and you'd have to access the venue on foot over cobbled streets or there is a street in front of the venue where you could be dropped off.
805,There was an accessible toilet in the entrance area. Modern and large enough to accommodate a sizeable powerchair.
806,Easy to use
807,really easy the staff helped me with the disabled lift
808,Small bathroom and not accessible
809,There was an accessible toilet which included a baby changing table. It was spacious enough to manoeuvre or for a carer to be in there and there was hand rails. Could have been slightly cleaner was the only criticism.
810,"Two Temple Place was originally built for William Waldorf Astor, in the late 1800s, as his London town house. It's an impressive building and is worth visiting for the architecture alone. Today the building belongs to the Bull Dog Trust and annually they open the house the public for an exhibition. Usually end of January until April. The exhibition is free and they also host events, some which have a cost. The 2018 exhibition is Rhythm & Reaction, The Age of Jazz in Britain until 22nd April 2018. Previous years have been Ancient Egypt, Collections from the Industrial North West, Sussex Modernism: Retreat and Rebellion, etc. They also have a café. "
811,"Large spacious toilets with grab rails, a raised toilet seat and wash hand basin. The shopping centre has disabled toilets on both the first and ground floor"
812,Ample parking all around the museum with modernised mainline rail station on other side of road. Bus routes close by.
813,I seen that the toilets were tight and compact but had everything that I needed.
814,"Needed to drive chair through narrow area to get to disabled toilet, this was in the ladies toilet. No running water in sink or soap. Had to use main sink and had to pull hand soap off from holder on wall to use it as it was up to high and i would not have been able to use the hand push pump on top. "
815,Easy access throughout
816,"Taxi ranks, Leeds & Victoria train stations, & Victoria tube station are all very close to their respective coach stations. Both are situated on shallow slopes."
817,"There is no parking immediately at the venue, but there are disabled bays on the streets nearby. This is a city, so can be busy.

There is public transport a 5-10min walk away, including bus, tram and train (nearest train station is Waverley)"
818,"There are several accessible toilets: one in the cafe area is always clean, it has plenty grab rails to allow a safe transfer. It is however a little tight for space is there was more than a manual wheelchair and a carer: anyone that needs more space for assistance I would recommend the pool toilets past reception. In the pool toilets the are various alarm cords, fixed and mobile grab rails- also there is a commode an a hoist system attached to the ceilin."
819,"Getting around Copenhagen is relatively easy there are good, regular bus and metro services.
Bikes are very popular and there are often special bicycle lanes.
Some of the pavements are cobblestone, but usually where that is there are smoothed parallel paved stripes which make it easier to walk/ wheel on. 
At the traffic lights I noticed most admitted a tone, which speeded up when the green man came on.
The area is generally flat.
The Little Mermaid is very small, and unassuming. 
Tivoli amusement park has step free access to its delightful grounds and gardens and a couple of accessible rides and is well worth visiting (see separate review),  
Christiansborg  Palace, is just one of the many royal palaces in Denmark, it has step free access to its state rooms and stables (see separate review). Amalienborg Palace is another royal palace and where Changing of the Guards take place.  
Nyhavn with its harbour, colourful former warehouses and lovely cafes is a great place to relax and soak up the atmosphere. One side of the canal is busier than the other and the quieter side doesn't have cobblestones.
There is also a lot of art and cultural things to see including the Glyptotek, a gallery with European, Egyptian, Greek and Roman artwork founded by the Carlsberg brewing family (see separate review).
There is also 60 minute boat tours, suitable for some people with mobility difficulties, where you can see many historic and contemporary sites (see separate review).
The beautifully maintain and tranquil King's Gardens is the largest of Copenhagen's parks (see separate review).
The city centre, where most of the tourist attractions are located, is relatively small. If you choose a city centre hotel it should be easy to get about.
"
820,"Everything was on one level. NO steps, slopes, ramps to contend with. "
821,Staff did not ask basic questions regarding the purchasing of fish.
822,"We got the bus to Westminster Bridge - and although the buses are great we didn't realise there's no step-free access to the lower area where the Sea Life centre and other attractions (including the London Eye) are located from that road. I wouldn't have been able to walk around to the other side to get into that area (it was too far away), so I had to hop down a lot of stairs instead, which wasn't great."
823,"Blue badges get free parking. The parking was a bit hit and miss as the car park was covered in frost.
The normal disabled facilities all seemed to be open. 
The zoo is on a hill, taking a carer, who gets in free, would be advised as it is a bit steep at times. 
The zoo transport to the top is not avaliable. "
824,"Good lift, lovely staff to meet and greet and show you to your seat. Huge area. We had the best seats in the house."
825,"Access in and around the building:

As I could not use the portable wooden ramp deployed to get up the steps in the entrance foyer but review stops here. My powerchair would have been in danger of tipping over if I attempted the gradient of the ramp. That said, some manual wheelchair users would be able to negotiate the ramp.

Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:

I was unable to access other areas including the reception, dining area and accessible bedrooms. I have awarded a one-star rating in acknowledgement that other manual wheelchair users may be able to use the facilities."
826,"There isn't much parking near the Meadows, but lots of buses stop nearby (3, 29, 47). For the 3 and the 29 there is a 9 minute walk to the venue, but the paths are flat and well-maintained. "
827,Plenty of parking
828,everywhere was wheelchair accessible on our visit the only problem was it was a bath with overhead shower which is ok for some ambulant disabled but not for all their is both a lift and hearing loop in the reception 
829,Tables very close together but staff were very helpful in clearing a path for my wheelchair. Can recommend the ravioli with caramelised pear. Unfortunately won't be going back as no disabled toilets and couldn't get my wheelchair into the ladies. 
830,The disabled loo is accessed directly from the cafe - unfortunately it was out of order on my visit.
831,MRC Para Rowing squad is staffed by a small team of dedicated volunteers. The team do their utmost to help every disabled rower  reach their full potential. There is specialist equipment available to allow disabled rowers to  get the best from their sport. Everyone is welcoming and very accomodating. The squad has a fantastic atmosphere.
832,"As amazing as the cakes are the access, sadly, is not. Being in one of St Stephen Street’s basement shops, Lovecrumbs in Stockbridge is difficult to access."
833,Excellent - fully wheelchair-accessible.  MUCH better than some accommodation that claims to be accessible but isn't.
834,Access to courts is via a lift but reception is direct from car park.
835,"Access to and from the station was easy with lifts to all platforms, an accessible toilet, good signage and helpful staff."
836,There are no steps
837,No parking at the venue but there are on road disabled bays on nearby Beaumont Street and New Inn Hall Street and you can park in resident's only bays in Oxford if you have a blue badge.
838,"I found access in both cities in Sweden excellent especially Gothenburg.  Pavements & roads where well designed and in good repair. The only area in Gothenburg with cobbles was a district called Haga. Very pretty and because quite compact cobbles not really a problem.  Very good coffee shops & lovely old wooden houses.
We travelled by train from Stockholm to Gothenburg this was also a positive experience. There was an automatic ramp on the train that staff operated so no waiting for ramps to be brought.
The train journey is also very pretty passing lakes & woods.
I cannot recall any shop or restaurant I couldn't access in a wheelchair.  
Hotels also excellent Downtown Camper Hotel in Stockholm (part of Scandic chain I think) and Comfort Hotel in Gothenburg.  
Sweden is not cheap but was not as expensive as we expected. One tip Gothenburg has an interesting indoor market so one evening we had a picnic - the weather was mid 20s - something many locals did as well. There were pop-up bars by a park close to the sea as both cities are built on archipelagos.




"
839,Staff were very helpful and friendly.
840,Not brilliant!  Usual heavy doors to interior but there is a ramp.  Level access inside but it is cramped and rather unsuitable for disabled patrons.
841,"Cheltenham Literature Festival is an annual event which runs in October. We've been gping for years and have watched it grow in size from a few rooms in the town hall to a huge event that is now staged over two glorious small parks / gardens that are a couple of hundred yards apart. When they first started using outdoor venues (marquees) they struggled with wheelchair access but have taken feedback on board and learnt from  experience.  On one occasion they even changed the carer seats in one venue  from fixed seating (which can be very difficult with care needs and different wheelchair sizes)  to movable seats - and they did it overnight following one comment!  The new arrangement has continued ever since. It's known as 'the invisible row A' !  No event staged in marquees will ever be perfect but this one goes the extra mile to provide the best access possible.  Box office organises wheelchair (and other needs) booking, staff and volunters throughout the festival are really helpful and if you have feedback (because however good it gets everybody's needs are different) they will listen. Go for a day, a weekend, the whole ten days! Just book tickets for the events you want to see and enjoy!  There are also Science, Jazz and Music festivals at other times of the year.  (Check access for different venues at the Music Festival.)"
842,"The museum is just off the c, the main square in Vieux Nice (the Old Town). Buses and trams stop in the vicinity but it will involve a short walk. Approaching from the sea front is a level walk."
843,All very friendly
844,The entrance is flat and the double doors are wide there are no steps in to reception and there is a ramp in the building so access to the toilets is simple..  If you use the Welcome App then staff will open the internal door into the dining area. There is seating in the reception area but I would have a appreciated a tall chair at the reception desk.   However there was seating available
845,No parking and difficult to park on the road.
846,"Very helpful and willing to support us, all polite and welcoming."
847,Disable access is very good.  Pendragon cater for those with profound disabilities.  The centre was easy to find using a sat nav but not many signs on the actual industrial estate.
848,Good size of restaurant to manoeuvre around.
849,"Staff are very helpful. Their is only one accessible toilet, which is not very accessible .The seating for wheelchair users gives a very good view of the stage , but the carer has to sit in front. By phoning the box office direct , the carer gets in for half price . 
The parking locally may be difficult. We parked in a nearby side street."
850,"There's a low threshold with a small ramped entrance (see photo). Inside there's a smooth wooden floor. There's room to get a wheelchair through the door, I would think (though I was on foot today) and definitely room for one at the tables by the window. As it's narrower at the rear, a wheelchair wouldn't fit there - however most of the tables are towards the front.  As the loo's right at the back, it's a bit tight getting through on crutches but definitely possible with care."
851,"Parking at rear of property right at door, wheelchair accessible "
852,"No steps, flat surfaces on each level and lift available."
853,Not usable for me due to right hand support rail too far from the toilet. The ramp through to Tesco next door had a step at the end and the Tesco toilet had broken support rail and was grubby. 
854,"The entrance is around the back for everyone off a cobbled courtyard which is uncomfortable as a wheelchair user. There is one small, slightly wonky step, which my wheelchiar could not manage, but I just needed a small lift at the front and then I made it in. The restaurant knew we were coming and placed us at a great table that was easily accessible from the entrance. Some of their tables are upstairs however so best to book. "
855,Overall a very easy and pleasant building to visit with some spectacular Edinburgh cityscapes to see !!
856,"I got a taxi to Elgin Cathedral so I can't comment too much on the parking. However, I do know that on-street parking is available several metres from the cathedral. Visitors can be dropped off at the entrance."
857,"There are many different entrances to access the centre, all which accommodate wheelchairs. There are multiple lifts within the shopping centre which allow easy access to the different levels. There is also seating located around each level of the shopping centre which allows an individual to sit and rest if needed."
858,"Getting from the car park to the main entrance was easy with a wide path and plenty of room for social distancing. Once inside the main entrance I showed my ticket and was given an outline of what there was to see, what was open and the new one way system for getting around. Once I set off the paths were good and the route fairly easy to follow. The inside displays are all closed but there are plenty of animals to see outside as you walk around. Be warned, it is a fairly hilly site and the mobility vehicle is unable to operate just now due to covid."
859,We visited the Manolo Blahnik exhibition recently - it was brilliant!! The shoes were just fab!! And there’s loads to see if you’re not a shoe fan too - from armour to paintings and a whole lot more! There’s also a great cafe in a light and airy atrium to enjoy a well deserved coffee and cake afterwards.
860,"Very easy. Extra wide doors, wheelchair access through front door, wet room, shower seat etc."
861,"We booked a space nearest the disabled toilet block for our son who is disabled, planning on staying in a tent for 2 nights, we were told that it wasn't possible to pitch a tent near the disabled ficilites as they were only for camper vans or caravans.  The attendants were very rude and said it was the caravan clubs rules that disabled faculties weren't for people staying in tents."
862,"No disabled parking so I had to park in the car park which is about 20M away, they could do with having some dedicated disabled parking for the spa
No marked parking bays so no extra space to get wheelchair in/out"
863,Good access for an old building.  Lower ground a bit cramped but still do-able (maybe better on a quieter weekday)
864,A small ramp at the entrance but otherwise fully accessible
865,The staff we met were helpful and friendly. We were particularly impressed by the cafe staff who helped us get refreshments and then settled in a comfy spot to watch the world go by.
866,Staff are generally very helpful 
867,"On our visit, we were fortunate enough to meet the owner who took time to tell us about how they have built up the place over the past six years, the practicalities or running the place.  We really appreciated this and it and it was so good to hear of the plans and issues faced going forward."
868,"For the size of the car park there is very limited blue badge parking. You don't get any ""free"" time and have to pay to park."
869,"Excellant, all entrances are wide enough for wheel chair users, and disabled toilets are available on ground & upper level. "
870,On Lothian road so lots of buses pass and walkable from haymarket in around 15 to 20 mins 
871,Very easy to find. Spotless. Good handrails. Perfect.
872,Easy for wheelchair to get in and out. Level.
873,"Lots of parking available, and disabled parking spaces near to the entrance. Bus stop also very close to entrance, so very convenient if using public transport."
874,"The cafe can be quite tight, especially when busy but overall it has quite good access and the tables and chairs can be moved if required. The entrance door opens outwards towards the ramp which could make it difficult for anyone using the ramp and visiting by themselves. There is a code for the toilets which isn't great but I believe this is quite across Costas."
875,Staff very helpful and friendly.
876,Automatic doors. Slight slope at the exit but nothing too much
877,"I am mobility impaired and usually use a wheelchair and so a lot of this report relates to the accessibility aspect of our (my husband and I) two way Atlantic crossing on the QM2.

We checked in about one hour early and that did not cause a problem. Embarkation at Southampton was easy and efficient. We had pre-booked parking and from arrival in our car to getting into our state room took about 40 minutes, the longest queue being security. We were directed to a special check-in area to one side of the terminal with low desks suitable for those in a wheelchair.

Getting from quayside into the ship involves a lift and a bridge similar to that in airports with quite a few difficult to negotiate ramps. Staff (at both ends) on the way out seemed to have been instructed not to help those in a wheelchair manage the ramps and it was annoying to have to struggle to get the chair over the ramps with someone in uniform standing watching from a few feet away.

Our cabin (6108 – not an accessible cabin) was larger than we had imagined. The shower / bathroom had a reasonably low step into it and the shower stool we had requested was already in the shower. We brought with us a couple of suction cup hand rails to affix to the shower walls (purchased on-line for under £10) and these worked very well. 

We stored our folding wheelchair (and our walker) out of the way adjacent to the window – it is an “18 inch” wheelchair and thus too wide to go through the cabin door. We did have the opportunity to see an accessible cabin on the same deck and this had a wide door, a wet room and a lot of floor space although a porthole window (we had a sheltered balcony). We will try to get one of these next time because of the extra space. Our cabin steward lent us a very large rubber floor / door wedge to hold the cabin door open whilst we negotiated entering and leaving– we will bring our own on any future voyages.

There are numerous lifts throughout the ship (A and D are larger than B and C and there are also quite a number of smaller lifts that you have to use to go from Deck 3 to Deck 3 Lower. Most of the ship is disability accessible although some of the doors need holding open and there is one area on the very top to which a wheelchair cannot get. Immediately following any of the lectures, all of the lifts were very busy and it was difficult to get one with sufficient space left for me (in the smaller lifts I took up about half of the lift floor area). We found that the best way to go up was in fact to get in a lift going down and then come up again.

The crew were always willing to offer help with carrying trays, opening doors or patiently standing to one side as we progressed down corridors (unlike some of our impatient fellow passengers who behaved in an insensitive and / or disability blind manner). 

We learnt where the best (marked) spots in the presentation venues were for wheelchairs. You should note that these places in Illuminations are very good but some of those in the Royal Court on the upper level can very poor with a restricted line of sight. It was disappointing that some of our able bodied fellow passengers were unable to read the signs indicating certain seats were reserved for those with mobility issues.

We had no problems eating in the Britannia Court Restaurant, the waiters moved chairs out of the way and ensured I could easily get into a seat and also stored my wheelchair nearby if I chose not to sit in it during the meal. The same positive comments apply to all other eating venues.

We disembarked in Brooklyn for a few hours, the ship arrived on time at 0600 and disembarkation started around 0730. It took us 40 minutes to get from our cabin to outside of the terminal (note that there are few facilities within the terminal and no WIFI – it is really a large shed used for arrivals and departures and other things).

Before arrival in Southampton a note appeared in our State Room saying that we had been registered for wheelchair assistance on arrival – I am not sure if we did something to initiate this but it was very welcome and solved my worry about managing the wheelchair and our luggage out to curb side – it took only 15 minutes from being collected in the QM2 to leaving the car park.

Overall I would say that staff and most of our fellow passengers did practically everything they could to minimise the challenges of caring for a companion in a wheelchair, often without being asked.

In summary, we enjoyed our two way Atlantic crossing and would happily (and intend to) join the QM2 again. One just has to accept the very few negative aspects and enjoy the many positive ones."
878,Two disabled bays directly outside of building with dropped kerb at one end. Unfortunately the delivery drivers frequently use and partially block them.
879,Stewards readily available to guide you to the ample number of well attended-to disabled loo's. Having your own Radar Key is handy but stewards in attendance will guide you to the nearest kiosk should you need to borrow a key. 
880,"braille on lift, signage fair, think theres an audio loop, "
881,"I popped in for my breakfast Danish pastry and coffee. I had hardly appeared in front of the shop before a sweet young man rushed to the door to ask if I needed assistance, and then promptly got me a very sturdy ramp. Delightful service at the counter, and before I had even turned round to leave, another sweet young man was putting the ramp in place again. The staff at this branch have really got it right: accessibility is just part of their normal day, no fuss, no trouble. Congratulations all round."
882,"Two disabled bays and further basement car park. Off street parking and large public car parks within 500 metres. Free shuttle bus stops outside. Approx. 1/2 mile from mainline train station and 1/4 mile to main bus station. fairly level from train station, uphill from bus station."
883,"2disabled toilets, one for females, one for males"
884,Amazing.  I forgot to mention on the initial review you get milk and lovely cake.
885,"Once the ramp leading from the car park to the automatic doors has been traversed, it is all level access.  Cameron Toll itself has an open plan layout so entry to individual shops is easy."
886,"We booked this site, way back during lockdown, when campsites were all booked up almost for the whole year. We were just glad to have found somewhere to get a week away. So checking accessibility wasn't my top priority. To be fair, when away in the motorhome, we have our own toilet and shower and as long as hubby is with me, most things are possible. If I'd have come here alone, I would have seriously struggled though."
887,No disabled parking near by
888,Large garden centre with café and clothing etc. Plenty of room to get about (except in the Clothing / Household section which is pretty cramped for a large wheelchair to get though without pulling stuff off the rails) and helpful staff.
889,"Many people will likely be on their holidays and staying in a nearby hotel, so may not  require transport. 

There are several small car parks in Last Americas each of which have several marked disabled spaces. In general, I noticed there are a few disabled parking bays on most of the main/bigger streets, including on the Golden Mile.

The local buses (green ones) all can lower to allow people on/off easier. They have two sets of doors, one at the front where the driver is, and another in the middle of the bus. The middle set are wider and would provide better access, there are marked disabled spaces within the buses
"
890,"This venue is fully accessible and unlike most has a CHANGING TABLE with side bars too
The staff are friendly, the museum is interesting for all ages. We take grandad in his wheelchair aged 90 and also little tots I childmind as young as 18moths. Something for everyone. 
Restaurant sells reasonably priced meals and snacks. Toilets are spotless. "
891,"Accessible toilet immediately beside the lift as you cam into the cafe area. Plenty of room to manoeuvre, adequate grab rails & emergency pull cord."
892,"The Castle Isle Restaurant is part of the Rosneath Castle Caravan Park, but it welcomes non residents. The park is in a lovely position on the Rosneath Peninsula, overlooking the Gare Loch.  "
893,There are various disabled parking areas and car parks in the city centre so parking is as much the same in any city.
894,"This is a pop-up theatre which is a copy of the original Rose Theatre which pre-dates Shakespeare's Globe Theatre; despite being very historically accurate, this theatre is still really accessible.  I had an amazing time here, it was absolutely hilarious and as one of the disabled platforms is uncovered with the 'groundling' seats area, I also got absolutely soaked (more expensive covered seats are available). It was a testament to how great the play was that no-one left during the downpour!  I had a fantastic view throughout and if anything the weather actually added to the experience as the downpour started during the shipwreck scene.  You are not allowed to put umbrellas up as it would restrict other people's views so I was glad of my waterproof and I would strongly recommend taking a good, warm one if you are in the groundling platform."
895,Okay parked without any bother
896,"Full wheelchair access throughout the museum with two lifts which can hold up to four/five wheelchairs at once depending upon the size. There are three access points into the museum; via the street cafe, a side-ramp by the entrance, and a platform lift by the entrance."
897,Overall access is good.
898,Very friendly and helpful
899,"Accessible toilets in visitor centre, plenty of other accessible toilets easy to find around the site. All that I used have grab rails and are large enough for a carer and wheelchair if necessary."
900,"Very large, luxurious bathroom with toilet included. Grab rails both sides of toilet, with one lifting up when required. High toilet. There is plenty of room for a cater to assist.
Other aids are made available if required.
Absolutely spotless."
901,There is an accessible toilet
902,"A large open plan, level access, leads off the St. Enoch Centre into the store. Bags of room to get around and see what you want."
903,There is parking directly outside the front door.
904,The staff have been well-trained when it comes to helping blind customers.
905,"Good access around the gardens although glasshouses hard for a large scooter, but an average whelchair should be OK. "
906,"Very good at what she does, and used to dealing with people with reduced mobility - she won't let you fall off the bed, and will move any limbs that refuse to behave!"
907,"David and Jennifer Binnian bought the land in 1973, and starting off as a hobby, it has been developed into a nice Arboretum, of some 170 acres of mature woodland and lakes. Their efforts have been rewarded when they received English Heritage status in 1995.
It’s a bowl shaped plot, with two small valleys fed by spring waters, and over the years have created 15 pools. Over the first five years, 12,000 tons of earth were 
moved, and new buildings erected.
The main central attraction is the big pool, where rare and ornamental trees are seen, and around the site, there are over 3000 species of tree and shrubs planted.
A pleasant walk may be taken with interest at any time of the year, but disabled people may be limited to enjoying the area around the big pool, and enjoy refreshments in their restaurant.

The Arboretum is just a short drive from Kinver, (please see our seperate review of 
Kinver, as you may wish to combine these two trips to make a really nice days trip).
You will drive along beautiful country lanes until you arrive at Bodenham (photo 1),
And then driving along a mile long winding lane through beautiful scenery, and for us, Autumn colours, just beginning to show their exquisite colours (photo 2).           
A beautiful view opens up over the Worcestershire countryside (photo 3), before the view over the car park for the Arboretum draws you forward. (photo 4). We drew over to the higher of the car parks on our right, and drove up to the far corner, with a stunning display of Autumn colours (photo 5) From there you will get a view of the Arboretum with its entrance below you, and of the lake beyond that. (Photo 6). 
It’s not to expensive at £6.50 each on our trip in November 2021, but we felt that was just to much for us as disabled would be limited by what they will see, so we chose to drive back along the lovely lane, and continue with our drive, and take in the stunning rolling hills and countryside, (photo 7) as we headed towards the Wyre Forest.
After a few miles driving through lovely woodland scenery of the Wyre forest, but sadly on a winding main road, we reached a very small parking area on our right, so if you fancy a little walk through conifer trees on a hard compressed soil path (photo 8)  you would not be disappointed. Or do as we did, by driving along a few yards further to reach a parking area to our left, which offered wide open views through the forest on a well marked out level path (photo 9) and here you will see ancient woodlands just coming into colour.
A few miles further on look for signs for the West Mildlands Safari park. It’s a busy fast road as you approach it, and you will need to cross the carriageway to be able to enter the park (photo 10). Then many traffic lanes will take you along towards the  
Kiosks (photo 11).  There are five kiosks available at busy times of the year (photo 12), and you can join the two hour Safari drive though the complex.
At this point we decided to leave the visit until another time, and we moved on towards what would be for us, the highlight of our days drive, at the fascinating Stanford Abbey hotel (please read our forthcoming coming trip to the Abbey (Photo 13).

Our final thoughts
Well worth the drive through the beautiful scenery whatever time of the year you choose, and easy enough for the disabled person to enjoy the day out, especially if you take in the Safari park.

If you enjoyed reading our review, would you be kind enough to tick the box section “I like”  as this will guide us as to continue writing our reviews in the way we do. 
Thank you for your support to ourselves, and other readers of Euans guide."
908,The train is just across the road.  Which is quite a walk if you have Mobility issues. The car park is about the same distance.
909,This is for the main building - as its relatively new access is good throughout.
910,"The accessible toilets are great in that there is an accessible loo adjacent to the reception area. Large with grab rails, good lighting and turning space. More than that, there is a mobile Changing Places toilet station adjacent to the main entrance to the building in Windmill Street. Open from 10 am to 10 pm and staffed by volunteers. "
911,No 'staff' as such but plenty of stewards.  On the gate and crowd control - they are all helpful if gruff due to overwork.
912,"Recommended by a neighbour to try an outing to RBGE. Mobility scooters or wheelchairs are available to use at no cost or you can make a donation if you like. Hire time is 2 hours which in a freezing January day was more than enough. We phoned ahead to book and were warmly received when we arrived. Had a great hour exploring the gardens. Some hills and bumpy paths but the scooter took it all in its stride. Staff great at showing how to work the scooter, helping get set up and helping me feel comfortable waiting whilst my husband brought the car round. Short walk from the John Hope gate to the car pick up point. Web site could have made their accessibility statement more visible - especially as it's very good."
913,"I think you might say that this hotel pays lip service to accessibility but they haven't really got it right. I filled out the feedback form and ticked the box requesting to be contacted but as they haven't done so, I assume they aren't really that bothered about getting their access right. We parked in a marked bay but then I really didn't fancy trying to negotiate my way to the door of the hotel over a bumpy exit the car park. There was a pathway, evidently meant to be the wheelchair route to the hotel but it meant negotiating some rough grass in order to reach the automatic doors. We chose to use the covered area in front of the door as a drop-off point but obviously that only works if there are more than one of you so the other person can park the car afterwards. We then had to negotiate the revolving door as there was a step between the roadway and the automatic doors. We eventually spotted a button labelled with a wheelchair symbol which seemed to slow down the revolving door but I wasn't very happy about having to use a revolving door at all. The reception desk was high with no lowered area. 
Our room was spacious enough with room to access either side of the bed and the bathroom had a great folding shower chair with arms and also a sink that you could lower down to the height you wanted but it was so near to the lavatory that you had to sidle in between the two: awkward for anybody let alone somebody with mobility problems.
The restaurant had tables that you could not pull up to in a wheelchair so I had to transfer to a normal chair."
914,The only let down to this place is its loos. The door to the corridor where the loos are is very heavy to push open and neigh on impossible to pull open upon leaving. The loo is small not helped by the fact that a baby changing table is also squeezed in making it impossible to get to the sink. I had to reverse out! Try not use the loo or take sanitising wipes for your hands.
915,We got a taxi straight to the venue which really helped as it's up some really large hills. According to google maps it's a 10 minute walk from the Royal Mile which does look accurate if you don't have mobility impairments. 
916,"The staff in the restaurant were very helpful, friendly and attentive, as were all those we had dealings with in the hotel."
917,"This is a large cafe and farm shop located on the junction of the A1, A17 and A46 near Newark on Trent. There's also a petrol station so it's a handy place to stop if travelling. "
918,"The Opera House is in Vieux Nice, the old town, and it's entrance is one block away from the sea front, where several buses stop close by. "
919,"There was a disabled toilet/ baby change which seemed clean and fairly easy to get round in.  It had  grab rails but it was also storing sun umbrellas in the corner next to one of the grab rail, which might have been a problem for some people."
920,Everyone were very helpful especially in cafes and restaurants.  Happy to move tables and chairs to make room.
921,There is no red cord but the toilet is spacious and has the appropriate grab rails.
922,"As mentioned above, prompt ramp deployment the moment I appeared."
923,"There's a wee step to the front door but they will help you in, then it's all on the flat"
924,"Getting to the Bear Park involved driving on some relatively minor roads including hairpin bends. The carpark was right by the road but would have involved going up quite a steep slope to get to the entrance, so there were a couple of disabled spaces provided at the top of the slope."
925,A accessible loo with an additional raised seat if you needed it. With drop down supports. There was also a shower chair seat to aide with showering and anti slip mats provided.
926,"A difficult parking area, having to have wheelchair dragged across an area of deep chippings before reaching paved pathway. After this however, it’s quite easy to get around. Most of the hotel facilities you will need are on the level."
927,Access was limited due to work getting done to front of building.  Lift and area around lift had to be cleared for my arrival.
928,Helpful and friendly
929,Canal museum is located a short distance from Kings Cross station.
930,I use a large power chair and had no problems whatsoever accessing Little Bench or moving around inside.
931,Scan staff could have been more friendly.
932,There are disabled spaces near the front of the hotel
933,Okay
934,"great transport links close to bus and train station
small car park at the side of the theatre with disabled spaces"
935,"the visit was excellent good staff and nice clean entrance there was no
difficulty getting to our seats it was easy to find them and staff would help us the movie was good some problems were the food was over priced."
936,There were ramps for outside access and very large lifts inside. All shops were at floor level and could be accessed by wheelchair users. 
937,All doorways were easily accessed using a wheelchair. Plenty of disabled toilets. No steps and lots of areas 2 rest
938,Step-free access. Friendly staff who couldn't have been more helpful and attentive to my 'special needs'. Delicious sandwiches (need Homer Simpson dribbling meme here!). Reasonable prices based on the quality of what I got and the claims re: product sourcing. Only loses a point due to the lack of accessible loo.
939,As with most people who have disabled charges we arrived in our WAV with ample parking
940,The church was easy to access and the Verger was very helfpul in getting us in and situated.
941,Staff very helpful and from booking our holiday to check out always impressed with staff.
942,The club is in the cellar and not wheelchair accessible at the main entrance door but the bouncer was more than happy to take us to the accessible back door entrance (used by VIPs like Paul McCartney 🎸). Once we entered the club via the back door (which had level access) we then went in a lift and down a steep ramp through venue 2 and into venue 1. There is a gift shop which leads to the main club . 
943,Cheerful and friendly.
944,Plenty of onsite parking
945,Decent bus services on Easter Rd
946,"Arriving at Saint-Honorat there are either steps or a sloping path onto the main pathway. I have a mobility disability and walk with a crutch, and I found the paths doable. Most of the pathways are firm earth with pavement pathways just surrounding the buildings. The land is mostly flat, with wide shady paths, however I didn't explore the entire island.
There are useful leaflets with a map of the island with timings between distances which the ferry company have and there is a big map when you arrive on the island. However I didn't notice much signage. 
There's paths which follow the outskirts of the island, along the coastline, and paths which cut across the island to the Abbey. The pathways are wide and shaded by trees. The paths run along side vineyards. This area is like a nature reserve.
The main building is the monastery and the Abbey church. These historic buildings are set in delightful flower and tree filled gardens. There is a small step into the church and inside is relatively simple in style, which is in keeping with the monastery. 
There are various buildings including small chapels, tower, gateways, ruined remains which are also worth discovering.
I saw one of the chapel's and that wasn't open so not sure about access. I didn't visit the tower, shop or restaurant/ snack bar so unable to comment about them."
947,"Brilliantly accessible family trip out, ideal for 2-4 hours for families with small children, or an interesting trip out if you are interested in wildlife."
948,Steep drive but plenty of space. 
949,Fantastic concert but we did not have the best seats for a man who has mobility restrictions.
950,"Excellently accessible with ramps where necessary, wide, smooth concrete paths and boardwalks. Friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. "
951,"Modern clean toilet. Only difficulty might be the high paper towels and only a sanitary bin. See photo. Left a cord card as it was tied up.
"
952,"Car parking in the grounds includes about 20 marked disabled bays. Attendants were at the entrance and they pointed us in the right direction.

We arrived early and got in without difficulty, but the car park did fill up, and others parked in surrounding streets (free parking).

The nearest train station is Dumbarton East, however this station is not accessible if you use a wheelchair/have mobility problems as can only be accessed via a steep flight of stairs.

The nearest accessible train station is Dumbarton central. "
953,Car park is not really suited for wheelchairs but staff will try their best to direct you to somewhere more convenient if you ask. Buses do stop nearby but it is quite a rural location.
954,Very easy. Close to the main entrance 
955,"Level access throughout, helpful staff, and accessible toilet."
956,"During the 1840.s there were three stations in Edinburgh, collectively known as Waverley, but due to congestion at Waverley, plans were put forth to demolish all three stations and build just one large station, and by 1873 the new station was more suitable to take the extra traffic now needed. This soon became apparent it was not able to cope with so much more railway expansions, and a further alteration had to be made, and work began in 1892. It was a Hugh task, now to cover 23 acres 
of ground, and it included the new entrance from Waverley Bridge, which had started in the 1873 plans, and a new ridge and furrow system roof was built to lay as low as possible so it would not spoil the city,s skyline. Then the first and second class waiting rooms were built, ( but now, sadly due to the COVID 19 problems, the first class lounge has been closed during 2020/21, and it remains to be seen if it will be reopened. ) Finally, the new station was opened in 1921. Over the years further improvements have had to be made, (bearing in mind the Listed status now held ) so any work has to have Listed building consent. In 1994 the railway was privatised, and by 2004 new projects were put in place, including lengthening of the platforms, and between 2010/2020 the roofs glazing was replaced with 27,000 new panes of glass. (Photo3) It is now one of the largest of all British stations.
After having wheelchair assistance to get us off the platform at Waverley station, and along to the concourse (photo 1) which is all on the level, but very busy although we found everyone very friendly and helpful, including a number of passers by, who were very nice in allowing us to move around very easily, and my wife pushed me along to the lift (photo 2). We then rode up and across Waverley stations glass roof, 
(Photo 3) exiting we moved along the Bridge walkway, and a long push for my wife, which would take us eventually to the way out for Princess street, to Another lift (photo 4) which took us up to the level needed for Princess street. (Photo 5). 
A paved walkway (photo 6) took us along to Princess street (photo 7). All the main bus stops are along here (photo 8) which lead to Edinburgh castle. (Photo 9), and we had quite a view to the castle itself (photo 10). Crossing over Princess street, there are a number of hotels and restaurants. (Photo 11). 
Our final thoughts.
We enjoyed the train ride to Waverley station, arriving on time, and assistant service was there waiting for us, who took us along past all other platforms, we had arrived at the far end platform, so a long push for wheelchair, but it was easily handled for us, and it was no trouble using a number of lifts to get us up onto Princess street, so overall, an interesting journey, and we would suggest that if you are going to Edinburgh, you consider using the train service, as we found it so convient."
957,All the facilities at Touchbase are really accessible and fantastic.
958,"Always available , attentive but not intrusive or over fussy"
959,Access was after ringing a door bell. We were led on a long trek through the backstage of the venue. Some were backstage and were quite narrow so not sure how easy in a wheelchair. Staff did try to be helpful but I am not sure realised the accessibility issues. Venue had raised seats apart from front row but we were allowed in first
960,"One accessible toilet - a modern build,  which is the proud owner of a Red Cord Card."
961,Very attentive and welcoming theatre staff. Made our trip!
962,Great! We met at the bar and ate in the Orangerie. It was easy to move tables to accommodate people's seating requirements. The vast majority was level access but where there was a step it was easy to find an alternative route. 
963,"There are clearly marked disabled bays in the car park next to the visitors centre, which is a good starting point for the outing. If it is after 5, when the centre closes, you can easily park on the causeway next to the centre."
964,A steepish push up Little King Street and a fairly heavy swing door are the only obstacles. On our way in a kind customer held ithe door open for us. Exiting was easy with the accompanist opening the door.
965,"A spacious, clean and tidy accessible toilet it clearly signposted off the main hallway. It a very spacious room with plenty of manoeuvring space as well as space for carers."
966,"A fair amount of lovely, flat  accessible parking which is free if you have your blue badge. I have't tried the multi-storey car park but find outside more convenient."
967,"There's a fairly large car park near to the front door. Several bays are dedicated for use by disabled people. If arriving by bus there are bus stops within 200m of the entrance. I did find when arriving, by bus, that the accessible route to the entrance was not clear. A signpost would help. You head off to the left as you face the building and you'll find an opening with a sloped path up to the doors."
968,Spacious inside restaurant with easy entrance.  The tables are at a good  height for your wheelchair to get under.
969,Could not be more helpful.
970,Overall friendly
971,"The staff were as if sedated: uninterested in customers, and certainly not interested when I raised the question of a missing lift."
972,"It's hard to speak too highly of the hotel staff, all of whom were very attentive and alert to the specific needs of people with disabilities. On booking, it's possible to opt for a personal assistance care package. A variety of these are available, offering different levels of care according to guests' needs."
973,"From the gift shop, an elevator is available to access the museum."
974,Level access t the side of the venue.
975,"Pretty good. We had no problems getting in anywhere, though ramps are not always obvious - sometimes it's a bit of a long way round but that's ok.  Lots of the forest paths are flat and even and it was lovely to get the kids out in the countryside. Some areas have quite deep wood chip on floor, which is ok if dry but very tricky when wet - was a Shane as this made the maze a bit tricky. 


Pool access pretty good. Large changing room, though had to squeeze through a couple of tricky doors (or walk round entire changing area) bed, mobile hoist and chair that can go into pool down a ramp. 

There are some fantastic looking accessible bikes you can hire (please see photo) Several pieces of accessible equipment in play areas (big tyre swing you can lie on, ramps you can push wheelchairs onto one which makes sounds!)"
976,The accessible shower/wet room is excellent.  The shower chair/commode is a self-propelled aquatec ocean XL.  There is an accessible toilet and wash basin and grab rails if required.
977,"All staff were very helpful and friendly, both on my outward and return journeys. Special assistance had been pre-booked and all the staff were very helpful, polite and friendly. They ensured that I got to my plane safely and on time. "
978,"Not brilliant.  Access is good but finding the way to the changing area & the pool isn't easy (especially if you are unaccompanied)  However, there is level access throughout - bar the odd lope."
979,"You really need a motorised wheelchair or mobility scooter to visit this wonderful sculpture park set high up in woodland on the South Downs.  Some paths are very rough (tree roots and chalk) and there's a step into the reception (where the loos are situated). There is one mobility scooter (book able) available to bottom, and the staff are very friendly and helpful."
980,"A small modern arts centre located in an office block alongside the Regents Canal, about 400m from Kings Cross station. 
The programme of events includes music, visual arts, and a broad range of discussions, lectures and readings. Access is generally good. See the description in Access in London www.accessinlondon.org."
981,Keen to help.
982,There was disabled parking adjacent to the accommodation.
983,There were some disabled parking bays several 100 m away but very busy. No parking immediately outside.
984,Plenty of room
985,"There is a disabled space for 1 car beside museum. Behind the museum is North St car park and also West St car park, both of which are easy to access from museum."
986,Public transport to nearby leaves something to be desired with the exception of the 303 bus. Recently the roads and pavements around the museum seem to have been re-tarmaced meaning it's quite a smooth journey although bit of a detour for a dropped kerb to start.
987,There certainly was a disabled toilet/changing room - I changed in it. There must have been enough space therefore. As I said I discussed the hoist with staff so I'd be shocked if there wasn't one.
988,Disabled parking bays in a designated area. Only sticking point may be the incline from the House to the spaces.
989,"There was a one way system as a virus precaution. I was  given directions to make it easy for me to use my scooter to get to our reserved table, which was generously distanced from other eating areas"
990,Improvements are being made and the venue is actively trying to be more accessible. There is a lift and step free access can be arranged to some seats.
991,"Plenty of blue badge spaces in the car parks I used, by the theatre and the river. "
992,Would have given 5 stars but you can’t quite get everywhere & I do love my Gardens!
993,"Historic Site with John Wesley's first purpose built chapel in London and the Museum of Methodism in its crypt. There is also the Foundery Chapel and gardens in which are various memorials including John Wesley's grave. John Wesley's House, is a Georgian town house with has many of his belongings and furniture.  Free admission, donations appreciated. "
994,Entry to the visitors' centre is flat from the disabled car park and there is an electric door opener. There is a clear way through the visitors centre and an all weather route round the reserve. All bird hides are easily accessible in a scooter and there are also handrails.
995,Good as they have made an effort by ramping both tunnels but see above re having to go outside and back in again to get between bar and loo area/stage area.
996,"Helpful and friendly, serving good food quickly."
997,"There is an underground Q-park parking garage not far from the museum with accessible parking and an elevator.  Taxis can also drop you off fairly close to the museum.  To simplify things, the company Accessible Travel Netherlands can arrange taxis for you.  If going by public transport, be sure to call ahead to ensure all the trams are wheelchair accessible."
998,Good bus connections.  No disabled bays nearby.  Two unrestricted spaces just along from the front entrance.  Can park on double lines on street to the rear - no waiting restrictions but one of the residents isn't happy about that.
999,"Edinburgh Airport parking has a great new facility called FastPark which you can book online and is near the main terminal.  All you do is park your car in one of the ferry lanes unload your luggage and drop off yours and get a receipt all done automatically.  They will park your car for you and make sure it is there for you when you return,  
The cars are all scanned on arrival so any disputes over damage can be resolved easily.
Unfortunately this is the end of the good experience."
1000, There is a   Disabled toilet. 
1001,"The outdoor seating in front of the pub is step free and consists of fixed picnic tables and benches. Entering  the pub involves a single, small, low step and 2 sets of double doors, which were slightly tricky to negosiate with a crutch. Inside there is a central bar at standing height. There are free standing tables and chairs,which are quite close together. On the evening I visited it was busy and it was slightly difficult to get to a free table. The pub is on the ground floor. I didn't notice any upstairs seating."
1002,Nearby on street parking plus plenty of buses .
1003,Good no problems 
1004,There isn't one so it inevitably cuts your time there short! 
1005,"The toilets I used were next to the food court. They were spacious,  clean and had everything I needed. I have marked them as a 4 star, because I feel like they have missed the opportunity to install a changing places loo in such a large space."
1006,There are two accessible parking bays immediately outside the door of the farm shop. 
1007,The ensuite accessible wetrooms are enormous. They are well laid out and would have 5 stars if they had larger and more accessible sinks. Note the Euan's guide red cord in the photo ! See photo - Image 1
1008,"Double glass doors into the building via a smooth, gently ramped surface. Buggies and prams seem to get stored in the small entry way between the two sets of double doors which does reduce the space here. This area is also where queues form, so we found ourselves shifting back and forward lots as we waited to be seated. 

It is exceptionally noisy in The Milk Barn when it's at full capacity. With a small children's play area inside and outside, the noise levels are immense. After around a twenty minute wait for a table, we were seated at the back of the restaurant which was a little calmer. However, it took around 45 minutes for our food to arrive after that. There were people moving around everywhere between tables making it feel very busy, and this was made worse by the fact that you have to order at the till - at the same place people must stand to order ice-cream too. To get ice-cream, you have to go through two queuing systems - one to pay (first) and get a ticket, the second to actually get your ice-cream and choose your flavours. This is confusing, time-consuming and not the most accessible ways of doing things. 

At a quieter time, this would be manageable and I'm sure staff would have greater capacity to assist if required. It just wasn't the case when we visited."
1009,Viewing felt limited. Only one accessible toilet outside on the level.
1010,"A easy ramp leads to main entrance pull handled door, and level throughout the store, with plenty of room for chair users to move around. We saw everything we needed to see.
"
1011,"Lots to see and do for all ages.  Wildlife Park, play park, gardens and house.  Large cafe and Changing Places toilet"
1012,"As you approach from York Way, take the lower level pavement alongside the office block, from which the entrance to the main foyer is step free. The revolving doors can be bypassed through a button operated door on the left, leading into the Atrium. This is a relaxed public space with the box office, bar and café. Off it is the Rotunda Restaurant. There’s a wheelchair toilet (D90 ST75) towards the far end of the Atrium, near the top of the stairs going to the Gallery Level. 
The three venues are below the Atrium on levels -1 and -2. They are accessed by a lift (D90 W100 L130). There are two larger lifts for big wheelchairs and other mobility vehicles. Ask a staff member for assistance if the main public lift is too small.
There are wheelchair spaces in all the venues.  
In Hall One there are spaces in both the stalls (with sloped access) and the balcony (using a platform stairlift to bypass 7 steps). 
Hall Two and the St Pancras Room have flexible seating arrangements. There are good facilities for those with hearing impairment and you can discuss your specific needs with the box office.
See the write-ups in the Access in London guide www.accessinlondon.org"
1013,"The main toilets near the greenhouses are available for a whole family, locking yourselves at the main door. Accessible toilet is available as usual with its own queuing system."
1014,"Wonderful place to visit, especially if you're a child who watched the space launches with amazement (and if like me you always thought you might go to space).  We spent an entire day and had no problems getting around at all."
1015,"There is a large accessible toilet.    Whilst not exactly a Changing Places Toilet, it is well above the standard that I encounter on an everyday basis. I made a couple of suggestions and the  owner said that she would deal with them.  Although there was a  pull cord, it had broken off about 6 inches from the ceiling of the toilet.

I was assured that this would be dealt with immediately - will check on next visit."
1016,We were able to park right outside on single yellows. Not sure if there are any Blue Badge parking spaces nearby. There are good public transport links with several bus stops nearby.
1017,"I got a lift by car, but will start bus shortly"
1018,"Really impressed overall with the accessibility at this event. However you do need to remember that this is both a temporary event and an event based on a golf course, so you should expect a few bumps and lumps along the way.

From the car park there was a road crossing to get into the event, this was temporary traffic lights and when the operator saw us approaching they changed the signal so that we could get across safely.

We were then met by a mobility vehicle which was an elongated golf cart. It took a while for us to be able to get on it as my pal’s power chair is quite long (around 180cm) but eventually we did and we all managed to jump on and get driven to the course. The driver John was super helpful and gave us different options on where we might want to be dropped off based on where the most exciting golf was happening.

As we had arrived fairly late, we got dropped at the 17th hole where volunteers were manning the accessible viewing area and ensured that we could get on and see the golf. The platform was pretty busy and there were probably about another 6 or so wheelchair or scooter users on the platform already. The viewing area enabled us to see the whole of the hole - from the tee off in the distance to the green and the bunkers in front of us. 

After the golf finished, we headed to the Spectator Village and hung out in the Ping Pavilion. This was a large marquee which had a big screen, food outlets, a bar and loads of tables and chairs… And a great atmosphere! We were lucky that the weather was fantastic when we visited, but if it had been raining this would have been a great place to take refuge! Again this was very wheelchair accessible. This area also had its own toilets that were out the back of the structure, there was an accessible loo here but this was slightly tricky to access with a steeper ramp leading to a ‘barked’ area before being able to get on to the plastic tracking.

There was a course map that showed the accessible route around the course and we wished we had been able to get there earlier to see more of the action on both the course and in the Spectator Village as a lot of thought had obviously been put into the accessibility. "
1019,"Whilst the toilets themselves were nice, clean and spacious, they were hard to find. No clear signage could be seen by us. But there are accessible toilets within easy reach of the lifts and the red cords hang to the floor. "
1020,"This is London - they don't have their own parking. However, you can set-down/pick-up immediately outside, and there is ample disabled parking in the surrounding streets."
1021,Very respectful and helpful staff. Spoke to me rather than my support staff
1022,"There are accessible disabled mobile loos and showers available both on the main site and also on the disabled campsite, and these are regularly serviced and clean."
1023,Very helpful and understanding
1024,"All accessible toilets had a changing place and had enough room for at least one carer to also be inside. To open the toilet, a radar key is needed and these toilets are on levels 1, 2 and 3 . They are extremely spacious and have lots of grab bars which can be easily reached and used due to their lightweight nature, and a red cord that hangs all the way down to the floor so again is easy to access. Toilets are easy to find as they are near the lifts on each floor as well as well signposted.  "
1025,Some on site parking but quite a distance from the main entrance.
1026,"Single yellow line at door, easy to get in and out as no steps and one slight slope in restaurant."
1027,"If you are already in Glasgow City Centre, then the restaurant is wheel-able distance for me, I was near Central Station before going there and it was a relatively flat wheel there and back, because it is Glasgow City Centre there is no parking nearby, I would recommend getting a taxi if you can't wheel/walk there.  "
1028,"Our second time at Croft Bungalow, lovely place with everything needed. Also within easy walking distance of two pubs! The garden allows you to take exercise in a safe and nice location. Thanks Steve!"
1029,"We can only offer one star on this particular PART TWO review, as to get to disabled toilet you have to go round and down the slope to hotel entrance, up the ramp, in through a pull handled doorway, and round to toilets. 
However, this is clean and tide, spacious enough with grab rails if needed."
1030,Accessible to users with wheelchairs and limited mobility
1031,"The two disabled cottages are ideal for the less mobile or wheelchair users.
Plenty of room to get around, wide doorways. Ramps to the doors."
1032,We used a wheelchair taxi organised by Accessible Travel Netherlands to get us from the ferry terminal at Ijmuiden to Amsterdam Centraal Station. Drop off is very convenient and that station has lift access to all platforms.
1033,"Fine. It has a key which is kept behind the bar to prevent others using it but the staff kept it open for us. 

Only gripe is the loo could do with having a handle on the outside."
1034,"Previously stayed here in April with my parents. Went back for a week with 3 PA's. Accessibility is second to none and well equipped. Property is extremely spacious, clean and comfortable. Will definitely go back and would recommend to wheelchair users and their families/carers. Great job, thanks!!!"
1035,Excellent v good
1036,Getting into the building from the dedicated parking was fine with a level surface; albeit around 100m to travel. The accessible doors were of the push pad type. Once inside the main concourse was level and smooth to wheel around. There's a reception with dropped level counter. Once inside you're by the cafe and an accessible loo. Going through the barrier you're in the sports areas where signs and a lift point you in the right direction. The wheelchair veiwing areas were spacious and there were seats for companions. The view was fairly good although some areas were not so easily visible.
1037,"The Richmond Street Deli is a lovely little coffee shop in the Rosemount Area of Aberdeen. The deli makes delicious homemade soup, excellent coffee and very good sandwiches, wraps and breakfasts. The most unique feature about the deli, is that its has a free book swap. Customers can bring in books they have read and swap them for ones they haven't. The deli has floor to ceiling book shelves crammed full of fiction and non-fiction books to cater for any literary taste. The book swap works out significantly cheaper than buying books or getting library fines! It appears that the deli is wheelchair accessible (although I have not been there in my own wheelchair). The doors appear wide and there is a disabled toilet. The deli is on the ground floor and is cosy yet spacious. There is also a disabled parking space directly opposite the deli."
1038,"Accessable on the ground floor, key was kept behind the bar so remember to ask before you go.  Good room, plenty to fit a chair and clean."
1039,"Corridor to room 111 is quite tight in places, but manageable in a disabled persons scooter (as long as nobody is coming the other way !)"
1040,"If I could give this 10 stars I would.  It is absolutely fantastic.  The staff have got a great attitude, they are not only very skilled on the water but have the right attitude towards inclusion and make sure that everyone has a positive experience.  I cannot recommend it highly enough."
1041,Two disabled parking spaces to right hand side of restaurant. Additional parking at rear.
1042,"Nice big car park nearby but the rest needs to be done on foot.  Our group got Social Work transport to the said car park but it may be worth driving and then walking, although nearby Currie is on a good bus route."
1043,This hotel is situated in the center of town by all the main attractions. Disabled parking is available free with a blue badge in the car park opposite the hotel. Flat or lift access to all levels. Many wheelchair accessable rooms and two with a bed that can be moved up and down for easy care of the disabled person in bed. Wheel- in shower and shower chair available on request.
1044,"Huge car park with disabled bays, which are a waste of time anyway, and the whole complex has level walks and entrances intonshops"
1045,"Part of the Odeon chain of cinemas, but this one has recently been refurbished, and is now an Odeon Luxe. The biggest difference being the fancy new seating, every single seat in every screen individually reclines making them very comfy, and they each have their own little table. Good screens and sound (actually possibly a little bit too loud!)

Easy wheelchair access throughout, lots of room to move in all main areas. Ramp as well as stairs to front doors, which have push-button opening. All on the same level once inside. 
This cinema recognises the CEA card.

Hearing loop available at cinema tills and at the Costa cafe in the foyer, also film adaptations available Eg. audio descriptions, subtitles (but would be better to check their website/in the cinema, as may only be certain showings)

Generally seems to be two wheelchair spaces per screen (is relatively small cinema rooms for an Odeon, but this can be a good thing!) These were at the back of the screen we were in, with carers seats (luxury ones!) right beside them. Tiered seating, so all have a good view.

There were steps going down to the other rows of seats, a handrail went down the length of the wall beside them. Loads of leg-room when sitting in the seats, so would be quite easy if you had to get in or out during film.
"
1046,There is no parking directly outside the coffee shop but there is disabled parking at one of the car parks about 5 minutes walk away.
1047,"The staff are all very friendly and as well talking to you about the rooms or history they are all willing to help with any mobility issues, they have to control the lift but they were falling over themselves to help."
1048,Lovely attraction in Falkirk that’s fully wheelchair accessible.
1049,Accessible toilets available on both ground floor and level 2.
1050,Fantastic staff
1051,Ramp available for high entrance step. 
1052,"There is no parking as it's in the centre of town,  but there are public car parks within 5 minutes walk, and a Pulse bus stop within 25m."
1053,"A great Costa Coffee within Tesco. It has great staff, level access and is only a few minutes walk from the train station."
1054,"Mariatorget Metro Station

Mariatorget Metro Station is located on the corner of Swedenborgsgatan, a pedestrianised street with lots of cafes and restaurants and a 2 minute walk to Mariatorget square. The metro station is on the red lines 13 and 14. It is 2 stops from Gamla Stan (Old Town) and 3 stops from T Centralen (main railway terminal) which has a number of line interchanges. With frequent trains this means it is very quick to access other parts of the city. 

Mariatorget Metro Station is step free. It has a lift on the pavement outside of the station which goes to the ticket hall. Alternatively there are steps, including some steps with rails (see photo) which I saw a person using with a shopping trolley, but I have no idea if the gradient would make it suitable for wheelchair users. At the ticket hall level are ticket barriers. In front of the barriers there are brass rods on the floor. Where there are 3 rows of parallel rods this is where the entrance is to the ticket barrier. Where there is a single row of rods this is a no entry ticket barrier, as people are entering it from the opposite side. On the ticket barrier level there is also a small convenience store selling snacks, drinks, magazines, etc. There is then escalators or a lift, which is quite slow to travel and looks like it has been placed in the space where an escalator previously was as it is on a slope descending (see photo), which goes from the ticket hall to platform level. From here it is a level walk to the platform.

Sodra Railway Station

Sodra railway station is on the same street as  Mariatorget Metro Station and a few minutes walks away. This railway station is a commuter railway line. However trains from here go direct to Arlanda Airport. There are 2 trains per hour from Arlanda Airport to Sodra and the train journey takes about 40 minutes.  Please note that the trains to Sodra depart from Arlanda Central Station in Sky City, although you remain indoors, this is a quite a walk from the airport terminus.  The final thing to note about this route is that even if you have a pre-paid travel card you have to pay a supplement of 120 SEK (2019) to travel on this route. It was explained to me that this is because it is a train line owned by a different company and you pay an additional charge at the start or end of your journey to cover these charges. 

Sodra railway station has a lift from street level, where the ticket office is, to the platform. Outside the station I noticed a sign for special assistance (2019). It said in Swedish and English Meeting Point Pre-Booked Assistance for help and further advice call +46 774 55 55. There was also some writing in braille. There was also a logo of 2 people walking holding hands. 

For both the commuter trains and Metro there were lifts (Hiss in Swedish) and in the carriages there were priority seats. I didn't notice any designated wheelchair spaces but I was always making for the nearest carriage, so I feel unable to comment on that. On board there are announcements in Swedish, and occasionally in English, there is also a board in each carriage and an announcement for the next stop. The board shows or announces nasta (which is Swedish for next) and then it says the stop. Public transport is excellent and frequent."
1055,"You will have to drive to get to the centre as not any near transport links, but plenty of disabled parking. "
1056,Nice Venue for the community. Large space for activities and friendly staff.
1057,"Not the most accessible boozer in Leith, but a great place for a hangover lunch and a hair of the dog."
1058,"There are two accessible entrances to the hotel. One is just to the left of the main red carpeted revolving door and the other is through Leeds City train station. The ramp for the front entrance is very steep and some wheelchair users may struggle. 

There are lifts to all floors. "
1059,"Staff were on point. They were very thoughtful and when I explained I had accessibility needs, they told me all the different things they could do to help and made me feel like I wasn't a burden or bother. Would 100% go again in a heartbeat. "
1060,Accessible toilets are available in the museum and the cafe area. They were clean and tidy and nice and large. 
1061,"There is step free access at this attraction. There is a security section where they search bags etc. This area was quiet when we visited but you may have to wait in a queue if it is busier. You then move through to a holding area while you wait for the structure to return to ground level. There are informative boards here as well as activities to keep children entertained, a few seats, a short film and a bar area. It does start to feel quite busy and the seats fill up quite quickly."
1062,"It's fine getting around, although don't expect to get out on the open deck. Transferring from my scooter to one of the fixed seat and table arrangements was a bit tricky."
1063,"The store was level access from the St. Enoch Centre with an open plan frontage. Once in the store there was plenty of space for us as powerchair users to easily browse around without fear of demolishing the displays (not unheard of in our case)!

Everything was easy to see and well arranged."
1064,Bowling was a great activity!    Only £1 per game at 4pm!  Bar has 4 sports TVs!
1065,Well designed disabled toilet which I can run my small scooter in to.
1066,Level entrance at rear - has no steps
1067,"All the staff were very friendly, were always polite and helpful. They took the time to chat and assist with any questions."
1068,"The venue is quite small, however, the staff are very welcoming
and showed me to my seat before the show to make sure I was happy. With
the venue being so small and intimate, if you are in a wheelchair you
have to sit at the front.
Also, there is not great access to the bar/drinking area, however, the
staff offered to bring any drinks etc that I wanted.

"
1069,"Staff in shops very polite and friendly, as were the center staff."
1070,"In the terminal itself, the only toilets are in the small café area, which has a ramp for wheelchairs and mobility scooters. The ladies toilet only is marked as a disabled access one, so gents beware!"
1071,level entry access to all the building with an excellent lift.
1072,There are only disabled loos beyond the ticket barriers. 
1073,Really friendly service and food and loads of space for wheelchairs and has a disabled toilet 
1074,"Excellent, friendly, attentive and professional. Asked if there was anything else they could do to make me more comfortable"
1075,Really friendly staff! They speak good English and are happy to show people around. 
1076,Disabled access was good with a nice wide doorway so it was easy to wheel in. The threshold was level so no bumping or bashing to fight my way in. Inside there was plenty of space to have a browse around and check out the shoes.
1077,"Big comfy rooms, easy access & great breakfasts. Central location with lots of shops & places to eat nearby. Look out for the Harry Potter style mirror in the foyer"
1078,"After attending a number of events at the 2017 EIBF I realised that there did not appear to be any events for people with a learning disability.  When I approached the EIBF to ask if this was the case they conceded that providing such events had not previously occurred to them.  However, once the idea had been presented to them they committed themselves not only to the provision of learning disability events, including those for people with PMLD, but also to making the Festival as a whole even more accessible to everyone with any sort of disability.  
This was one of the highlights of our visit.  All of our people with a learning disability love picture books although they can’t read and they had the opportunity to have a comprehensive look at a wide range of books in a large, open space.  As the books were displayed face outwards they were able to view the books much more easily than in traditional books shops and they all spent ages choosing their own books.  It was difficult to get them out of the shop to go to the event because they were enjoying themselves so much.  I would definitely bring my daughter back to the EIBF next year even if it was just to go to the book shop and cafe.

The event:

The event specifically provided for people with PMLD was very well attended by adults and chil-dren with a broad range of disabilities.  It was a lovely event and everyone really enjoyed it.  This in itself is a major achievement as people with PMLD may have a wide range of difficulties, not least of which could be a reduced attention span and sensory impairment.  The event was presented by the poet and musician, James Carter, ably supported by Maureen Phillip, who works for Pamis and is a very experienced multi-sensory storyteller.  The venue was just the right size, with a great am-bience for a storytelling event.  The slightly lowered lighting seemed to have quite a soothing effect on the audience.  The story was told at the right pace and with the right sound level.  The music was appropriate, complementary and not intrusive.  The sensory elements added both entertainment and therapeutic value to the story. We will definitely attend similar events in future. 

Sensory experience:

The EIBF is a venue with a wide range of sensory opportunities ranging from the busy central area to the quieter tents and bookshops.  There’s definitely something for everyone regardless of their sensory impairment.  Our people enjoyed the buzz of sitting in the cafe watching all the activities and the different people walking about.  They enjoyed the calm atmosphere of the book shop.  They even enjoyed walking around the pathways and across the grass.  They seemed to appreci-ate the ambience of the different tents.  It was interesting that their staff had some reservations about how successful the outing would be but agreed that everyone in our party had a brilliant time and would come back again.  Perhaps because on the day that we were attending there were a couple of events for people with PMLD, there was quite a number of people in the venue with learn-ing and other disabilities so we didn’t feel different from everyone else.  We just felt part of the crowd and that made us feel even more relaxed.


They consulted extensively with the staff and families of PAMIS (Promoting a More Inclusive Soci-ety) which represents people with PMLD, ARC Scotland which represents people with learning dis-abilities and other support needs, and also the National Involvement Network which is a network of people who receive social care support.  This consultation continued throughout the period right up to the opening of the 2018 Festival and those consulted were listened to and given the opportunity to make meaningful and effective contributions to the events, the programme and the EIBF’s policy and approach to accessibility."
1079,It was very busy but they were still friendly & helpful.
1080,Three disabled bays at the side of the restaurant.  I took half a star off as the in and out junctions are very short.  There's not slip ramp so getting back onto the dual carriageway is a little scary.
1081,Level access entry
1082,The staff were very helpful and pleasant to deal with.
1083,Staff were lovely and helpful in all aspects
1084,We drove to the castle. The sign was not all that clear. There was plenty of parking at the castle and we were able to drop me off right outside the main entrance.
1085,"It has good access at the front, back and throughout the store. Also has a McDonalds on site and large clothing department."
1086,The access to the Visitors centre is down a short hill - other than that the park is fairly flat. I would highly recommend using their tramper to get about around the park as it covers miles
1087,"Finding a parking space can be stressful, however the National Media Museum provides parking spaces at front of the museum, with the maximum stay up to 4 hours, giving you plenty of time to explore the museum. Also provides 
car and coach drop-off directly outside the entrance. 
"
1088,There were approximately three disabled spaces at the front - parking charges apply I think?
1089,Disabled parking bays are directly next to the front entrance.
1090,Brodie Castle is on its own estate and you really need to come on an arranged tour or by your own vehicle. We arrived by car and swept into the car park but were confused by the absence of any marked accessible parking bays. We simply chose a spot where we wouldn't get blocked in and could access both sides of the car by wheelchair. It was incredibly disappointing to then struggle through the woodland path and then along the drive to get to the castle only to find there were a couple of marked accessible parking bays very close to the entrance.
1091,"The Scottish Parliament receives tops marks for accessibility. It has excellent wheelchair access, provides materials in alternative formats, has signed materials, and its staff are happy to help."
1092,It's flat into the restaurant and although it's in the basement there is a wheelchair lift next to the stairs. Once down everything is on the one level.
1093,This was amazing it really is fully accessible to disabled people I have severe cerebral palsey and can't walk sit or stand independently they were great they provided a chair to help with access to the pools and the changing rooms are very accessible
1094,"Several spaces in front of the centre, with ramp access up to main entrance. There is a sharp bend in the ramp, and wobbly tarmac at that point, which may prove difficult to negotiate unaided."
1095,The signage wasn't very good. There were a lot more stairs then lifts.
1096,"Two double doors to get in. Lots of space inside to move around, mixture of booths, seats and tables. When going up for a carvery a member of staff will assist holding your plate and picking food etc. The bar is big and a wheelchair user can see over the top. There is a self serve soft drink machine which is low enough for a wheelchair user to use also. Lighting is dimmed in some parts of the restaurant. Music is played in the background in the bar area."
1097,Loads better than it used to be! The new lifts to take you from and to Princes Street are a big improvement!
1098,"I honestly can't think of anything they won't have thought of or not be open improving. If you've any worries or questions, ring the club and ask for Dave Messenger. This gent is a gem and nobody could be a better Supporter Liason Officer for the club. He loves Watford FC and that passion rubs off on others. He'll point you in the right direction and will go out of his way to make psure you have the best day imaginable!"
1099,"On the sea front there are 2 parts which are flat and padestrianised. 

1) The sea front next to Playa Martianez  and Costa Martiánez (a swimming pool complex which 'Ive written a seperate EG's review for) and this area has a wide, flat padestrianised, paved walk way. In this area there are a few large hotels, restaurants and shops. There are palm trees and places and some seating. This area is popular, lively and busy, nice place to people watch.

2) The area round the old harbour, or old port, is also flat, but there are cobblestones. It is possible to walk round the harbour. There is also a small beach, with black sand and some seating. 

The area connecting these two sea fronts are on a noticable but not a steep slope.

Puerto de la Cruz becomes hilly quickly once you move away from the sea front. However the area by the old harbour is still quite flat. This includes Plaza Charco, one of the main squares and La Ranilla, the old fishermen's area/ old town which has a number of delightful restaurants and street art, brightly painted houses with balconies and cottages (I have written seperate EG's reviews for both of these places).

Moving away from the sea front there is an area called La Paz, it's up a steep hill from the sea front, but once at the area itself it has a more a gentle slope. In this area is the Botanic Gardens,  Plaza de Mirador de la Paz a viewing point and where there is a statue of Agatha Christie, Parroquia de San Amaro, a small church and Sitio Litre Garden (I've written seperate EG's reviews for all of them). This area has a number of hotels, restaurants and shops. It's popular with tourists. From this area there are buses or taxis into the town centre. I stayed at Hotel El Tope (see seperate review). 

There are numerous restaurants and cafes everywhere. I was staying half board at my hotel but I have written reviews for the places I visited for lunch.

On the outskirts of the town is Loro Park, a zoo, however I didn't bother to visit as from the comments about it, the park is set on a steep hill. "
1100,Sarah is very pleasant and was there to meet us with the controller to open the gates and explain things to use.
1101,Access around the whole hotel was easy wide corridors .
1102,Can't comment on the parking. The Metro system is fully accessible and the gallery is about five minutes on foot (and on the the level) from Monument Station. Local buses all have manually operated ramps and the drivers we encountered were very helpful.
1103,Good bus links on London Road and Elm Row. Near Edinburgh Waverley station and the York Place tram stop.
1104,Disabled parking spaces available on nearby streets.
1105,It's huge!
1106,"The restaurant is located in a pedestrian square. There is a bus station quite close, but I didn't see it. I took a taxi to the nearby Plaza Charco and walked there in a few minutes."
1107,"There are signs indicating. No stairs, making it easier. And can't remember entirely but quite sure there are benches along the way."
1108,The parking has improved recently and they now have disabled spaces at Seaton station. When we were there we had to park across the road in a car park.
1109,"Great accessible venue, lifts, stairclimber and courtesy wheelchairs available. All areas accessible apart from the Tower."
1110,Spacious toilet with Radar key
1111,"There is no specific parking for the venue. We used the nearby Grand Arcade's parking, which gives 3hours free when you scan your Blue Badge.  Cambridge is renowned for its parking being very limited and expensive. There's a lot of bus stops relatively nearby, although accessibility varies."
1112,"Accessed via RADAR key to the right of the carvery. It is also a baby change facility. Hand rails on either side of the bathroom. A red cord is hanging to the floor on the right hand side of the toilet. There is one vertical hand rail next to the sink. It is on the smaller side but I managed inside with my power chair and a companion although there was no room for me to turn fully, I just rolled in and reversed out."
1113,"Access in and around the building:

For me getting in to the building and around to the apartments was easy once I had someone show me the way.

The apartments themselves were well laid out and equipped. They were bright and light which is good for me as a visually impaired person. Assistance dogs were welcomed which was good to hear.

Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:

The bedrooms and bathrooms were not specifically designed to be accessible. That said, they worked well for me and were spacious and bright and light.

Access in the dining area:

The kitchen and the dining / lounge area was spacious and bright and light. Well furnished the apartments were an attractive alternative to hotel accommodation.

Access to other facilities:

The apartments are all self contained and there are no other facilities."
1114,There is an accessible toilet in the car park but it is basic and not that clean. I used our own in the motorhome instead.
1115,Great facilities in the bedroom apart from the lack of a vertical grab rail beside the toilet. Good disabled toilets in reception and at the pool
1116,"When you could get to them they were clean and well maintained. It seemed that there was nowhere enough of them and they seemed to be in sections that when I was trying to get out of the arena at the end of the night I was told I couldn't go to the nearest one as I needed a ""VIP ticket"" to use it even though I had used it on the way in."
1117,Easy for us as we came on the 124 bus which stops on Lothian Road - then it is a 10 min walk / wheel to Lauriston Place. Edinburgh being Edinburgh there are some hills to navigate! There are other buses though that do stop on Lauriston Place itself which would be even more convenient!
1118,Always been very helpful to me. Restaurant staff will carry food to your table for you if you need help.
1119,"A Victorian railway station that has improved much over time, currently well sign posted with friendly staff whom are happy to help. Wheelchair access is made difficult due to masses of stairs leading up and down to platforms, there are lifts although these do not prove time-efficient. It has connections to many points in the country, however limited and expensive exterior parking."
1120,We went to the disabled toilet beside the great hall and it was excellent.  There are other disabled toilets but we didn't go into them
1121,Staff acknowledged the items blocking the main walkway but did not offer to move anything or any assistance.
1122,"No designated disabled spaces that I could see. I did park further away from the play park area though as I took my dog on a long walk however, there is a car park right next to the play area and there might be disabled spaces there. There is a bus stop just outside the park, but I would recommend going by car as you would have to walk up a road to get to the park and it's quite a distance. "
1123,Easily accessible disabled toilet.
1124,"I was struck by this Hotel when reading further info by a reviewer about the Dunbar Community Bakery on this site. It’s an early Victorian 2 storey Hotel next to the Railway Station in Dunbar, East Lothian. The only downside is it’s not suitable for a wheelchair or power chair user as there are no lifts o the upper beepdroom floor, though there is access to the Hotel Bar and the adjacent Street bar. It is part of the Golf Guide Coastal Route and Dunbar is an ancient Royal burgh with lots of Hitorical buildings, Castles and Stanley homes with Royal connections. The Hotel had a real County feel about it and run by locals, staffed by locals and frequented by locals. It was busy and the current promotion of Belhaven beer, an extensive gin and cocktail list and a seasonal and Festive menu made it popular. The dining room wood  panelling was from the RMS Mauritania, scrapped across the Forth at Inverkeithing at the onset of Queens Mary and Elizabeth. The bottom floor totally wheelchair accessible, so do not let the accommodation issue put you off going. There is a Hotel car park, a full website and the room I had was very large, well appointed, good size bathroom and shower. The menu was varied but not extensive but catered for differences in dietary preference, with another review for a restaurant in Glasgow I have done, the Calamari was excellent and again not just rings but the whole squid. The steak and veg were superb, all local produce, the flavour of the beef was reinforced in it had been hung and allowed to mature. There was a special promotional price on the local beer, Belhaven. This little Hotel has been amongst various awards over the last 10 years and it’s not easy to see why."
1125,"There is good public transport to the venue.  Easy access off the main road with large clear disabled signposts.  Parking on grass with very helpful parking attendants who would allow you to unload on to the hard surface if required.  Quite a considerable walk to the entrance if you are pushing a wheelchair or a bit unsteady on your feet but the surface is smooth and wheelchair friendly, as is the whole of the racecourse (no gravel in sight)."
1126,"The owner had noted that I am a wheelchair user and pitched us near the service point and other facilities. The site is on a hill, so getting around the site is tricky in places. I used my mountain trike as the paths are all quite uneven compacted gravel. The main facilities are in a courtyard, which is flat and really pleasant. 

I had hoped we might be able to walk direct from the site into Grassington but the lane out is so narrow, a car wouldn't be able to pass me in my chair, so we had to use the car each day.

There is a dog walk on the site, which is secure and apparently safe to let dogs off lead. However, it is not accessible even with an offroad chair. There is a narrow gate and then steps down and hubby said the ground is steep and very uneven. I've yet to find a site with a dog run that works for me."
1127,"An unexpected find tucked away on the River Dee shoreline. The restaurant has a wide first floor balcony and panoramic windowed room with amazing views over the estuary and the distant Welsh hills. 
It is step free and has wheelchair friendly toilet and lift at ground floor level.
The food was excellent and staff were very friendly and accommodating"
1128,Exceptional. Gave my Mother-In-Law's guide dog a warm welcome and a bowl of water on a hot day. Went out of their way to make our visit easy and pleasant.
1129,parking good with disabled bays and good bus and train links. Leaflets and website gives good directions
1130,This is our 2nd stay at Summerfield Holiday Cottages in Scoreby Cottage.  There are 4 properties and the owners Jayne and Richard and live on site.  Nothing is too much trouble and my wife who is chair bound and I really love the location
1131,All I came into contact with were polite and courteous 
1132,"Good access for wheelchair, automatic doors, disabled loo. Lovely staff - very welcoming to me and my assistance dog,
dedicated disabled parking. A  pleasure to visit and the best facilities I have experienced at a vets' practice."
1133,The staff were friendly and welcoming. 
1134,At the abbey the man was not interested in us and tried to get us to join English Heritage. I was not impressed with his attitude
1135,The staff are just so lovely and helpful. Received a lovely welcome. They are a credit to the place. Service was excellent. 
1136,"Entrance: Manual push/pull door with short concrete ramp and threshold.
Dining area: Zero step, close quarters, minimal wheelchair access during peak hours.
Hallway to restroom: Obstructed by tables and seating; difficult to negotiate on foot, much less with wheels or assistive device"
1137,Willie and his team were great. They provided a professional and flexible service. Even catering for our last minute changes of plan. Their knowledge and care in transporting powerchair and wheelchair users showed.
1138,Excellent
1139,Pretty good! See pics for the 'bumps' and 'paths' to get to the water's edge. There is a small Cabin where you can get drinks etc - it is very very compact!
1140,"Regardless of the lack of public transport, getting there is quite straightforward. The park was really busy when we got there about 3pm on a Thursday afternoon in August.

My friend has a blue badge and the person at the car park entrance mentioned we could park at the visitor centre, very close to the sculptures. We just had to give a £3 deposit, get a card and then give it back on return. The was about 8 accessible bays.

Another option of getting there is to walk about 45mins from Falkirk along the canal."
1141,"On a recent visit to North Berwick we went to the Steampunk café with my Brother who is in a motorised chair. This is potentially a great cafe, with an interesting interior and relaxed atmosphere. The food was good and the staff were very helpful. However, trying to manoeuvre a motorised chair within the space is challenging. There is a large central dining area in the middle of the ground floor of the cafe that is bar stool height and getting the wheelchair past this to a table we could all sit at was difficult and involved other customers having to stop eating, drinking and socialising to let us through.  Unfortunately wheelchair access to a lot of businesses means accommodating a small manual wheelchair, if there was more space to manoeuvre a motorised chair we would love to go back."
1142,"The voluntary staff were in abundance, the NT property itself does charge to get  in,  but if you are members then a carer goes free. They honored that for us even though we aren't members. There are binoculars around to get a closer look at the wildlife. "
1143,"All five washrooms on the ground floor, although slightly outdated in terms of aesthetic design, boast grab rails, bins, mirrors, alarm cords, shower chairs in the shower rooms, and a ceiling hoist and wash and dry toilet in the bathroom.  There is also a low bath in this room with a shower and adjustable changing table. Currently, the taps are all of the swing lever variety, whilst the locking mechanisms are small and circular, requiring a strong, clockwise hand motion to operate them.
Upstairs in the Beamsley Project, there is one further toilet with the same facilities as those downstairs.  There are also two bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms."
1144,I was here volunteering for the twilight touremrnt within the peaks
1145,Super friendly and more than happy to help. Told wife/carer where was best for me to park and opened double doors to side for easier access and moved chairs to allow me to position comfortably at table. 
1146,"Staff were courteous and helpful all the time, and lose one star only because of their thoughtless placing of the bin in the accessible toilet."
1147,There is on street parking available which is free to badge holders. Derby bus station is about 10 minutes walk away and train station about 30 minutes walk away. There are bus stops a few minutes walk away to some areas. 
1148,"There is a public carpark very close to the restaurant, however it gets very busy during the tourist season and you have to pay, even with a blue badge. The carpark gets steeper the further in you go so I would advise trying to park as close to the entrance as possible."
1149,"Very helpful, nothing was a problem, I didn't want mushroom, so they gave me some of the tomato compote instead, which was amazing!"
1150,The accessible toilet is outside the visitors centre. It is tiny! I'm not sure that I could have assisted my son to use the facilities due to lack of space and it was very much like an outdoor shed.
1151,Fantastic access in and around the function suite.
1152,"It is all on one level, although situated on a hill.
The pathways are gravelled and also consist of uneven broken concrete and is very uneven. 
Many of the enclosures had secondary fencing about 4 foot high of thick, black cording making it very difficult to see inside them from a wheelchair. 
The small 'farm animals' enclosure has a moderately steep wooden ramp which has a small step at the bottom due to erosion of the ground beneath it and a small 'hump' at the top.
The porcupine house has concrete steps for children to view but impossible for wheelchair users to see into.
The snack shack has a high step into it, but there are snacks and drinks available in the cafe.


"
1153,"Blue Badge parking available.
Disabled ♿ Toilets seemed to be all open. "
1154,"Brilliant and one with bed, shower, raising sink, hoist and so on."
1155,Roomy toilets
1156,The staff are brilliant. They were very helpful getting onto the train. They were making sure the toilet was clean. They are very keen to help and make it as easy as possible for disabled visitors. 
1157,Staff on Wetwheels are amazing and so knowledgeable on their job and how to help people with a variety of different disabilities and different mobility aids. They really couldn't do more for you and you feel as if you know them and it's a family trip out. 
1158,"We visited this centre for 2 prebooked lessons with a coach.  Our sessions were designed for young people with additional needs and learning difficulties.
"
1159,"Wide aisles, big lifts, the trolleys in the cafe for the trays are good, though it is sometimes difficult to balance and get the trays off the  trolley, but I guess you can leave the items off one by one. "
1160,"All staff very helpful and supportive. Staff at entrance for guidance. As mentioned the army were brought in to support the vaccination programme, and were exceptionally, friendly and professional"
1161,"Nearest tube stations are Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus neither which are step free. Nearest step free tube is Green Park and then bus no 14, 19 or 38 to Shaftsbury Avenue. China Exchange is on Gerrard Street, the main street in London's Chinatown. It is pedestrianised from 12noon to 6am, with the nearest drop off point is Macclesfield Street."
1162,"There is no designated car park or disabled spaces for parking.   Limited on street parking.
There are bus stops outside the venue Newmains Road Renfrew.
There is no train station in Renfrew.  "
1163,"Toilet wise, we didn’t use one but I think  you’d need to use the ones in the brewery or the cafe."
1164,A member of staff had to open Toilet area doors.
1165,Unfortunately the accessibility features that are available for staying at The Crowne Plaza isn't the same as it used to be and means I probably won't be able to stay for a while.
1166,"The Eclipse Cinema in Strabane has a suitable size car park with disabled parking spaces and level access. There are local buses that stop nearby the cinema which would require some travel afterwards as the cinema is few metres from bus stop, however is signposted."
1167,"there is signage to nearest lift which isnt far, there is also a travellator (flat escalator) and stairs. there is a cafe upstairs also if you wish to stop and have a rest mid shop."
1168,"Not to easy for disabled, as long walks into halls, crowded  areas, narrow lifts, and generally Discomfortable but at least we can enjoy seeing the exhibits.
It now depends on how you arrive for the NEC, car parks are available, but we still recommend that you consider coming by train. It’s less of a hazzle. We came by train and our review is about DEPARTING the NEC after seeing our event, and although we personally use first class travel when we can afford it, this station is just 
as easy to use for standard travel, but just seating in communal areas.
Photo 1  coming up from the car park outside NEC station, you come to the concourse, where the monorail departs.  You then walk along to see your show in the various NEC halls.
Photo 2.  Coming out of NEC after your walkway ride, there is a small W.H Smith,s and two cafe areas.
Photo 3.  By the train ticket machines is the entrance into the station platforms. The 
whole of this area is wide and large, is always spotlessly clean.
Photo 4.  Through the ticket barrier is the platform and general seating areas. There are lifts down to all platforms. 
Photo 5.  The First class lounge is on the level, but there is no attendant, you have to
Press a button by the entrance, and show your ticket to a camera, and the door opens for you.
Photo 6.  In the lounge there is plenty of room for the wheelchair.
Photo 7.  Again, there is a good selection of snacks and hot or cold drinks.
Photo 8.  It’s a very comfortable and clean lounge, and has two tv screens with up to date times so you can check if your train is on time.
Photo 9.  At the far end of the lounge is the disabled toilet.
Photo 10.  There’s plenty of room in there, very clean, has grab rails and pull cord.
Photo 11.  Exiting lounge onto lift area, your assistant will take you into lift
Photo 12.  Then you are taking down onto Platform.
Photo 13.  The ramp is then put in place.
Photo 14.  And you are Taken into train.
Photo 15.  There is Space for wheelchair, which you can stay in, or go to your coach and seat.
Photo 16.  In the Standard coach, there is no way to get a chair down the aisle as it is to narrow.

Our final thoughts.
Now, a problem. We had booked and paid for a first class ticket with Avanti trains, , but we are taken onto a standard coach, as photos show, but it’s only one station ride, so we let it pass, but we feel you should know that buying a train ticket and booking assistant aid is a nightmare, they never get it right, we have always had problems, so this mistake is nothing knew for us, but these train companies need to start getting it right, it’s not cheap buying tickets, and we all deserve more care being shown to us. It’s sad, because once you are beyond buying ticket and arranging assistance, we find everything is really wonderful and well handled by all other departments, we have nothing but praise for assistant help."
1169,Reasonable GP with okay access for a wheelchair user. Could do much more.  
1170,didn't see any staff
1171,"Very helpful, even when lift from street to foyer was out of order they facilitated entry via side door with portable ramp."
1172,"From a mobility impaired point of view, the access is good. There are automatic doors into the building, and a lift down to the court level. The only slight issue to be considered are one set of heavy doors leading onto the courts. "
1173,There are clearly signed disabled access store at all of the toilets . No radar key required
1174,"Only met one young man, who was very pleasant and hard working as all on his own, which meant a very long wait for lunch order  to arrive."
1175,"Absolutely brilliant access for people with disabilities. This was the first match my little girl has been to, and (apart from the score) it was perfect!"
1176,"Lots of wide wheelchair friendly paths, even the lower woodland walk was manageable in the manual wheelchair with very little help!"
1177,"All staff were friendly and helpful. Advice and directions were given when asked but otherwise, they left us in peace. "
1178,Accessible without issue or alienation.
1179,Based at  neptunes staircase on the Caledonian Canal the moorings has glorious views of the canal and Ben Nevis. The new resteraunt is a fantastic addition with Windows with views from almost every seat.
1180,Staff very helpful pulled a chair out from the table we were going to and made us very welcome.
1181,The bar is on the high street so there is no disabled parking in the immediate vicinity..
1182,"Great farm shop on the outskirts of Skipton.  Accessible parking with easy flat access into the shop. There is always a staff member at the door in case you need assistance and plenty around inside that are happy to help out.  There is an area at the back that is decorated for the season so great for Halloween goods, Christmas etc. Brilliant selection of wine, plus all the usual farm shop produce.

The café is top notch. Great meals from breakfast to evening and there is also a mezzanine level that sells cakes etc (accessible by the lift) 

The only thing that lets it down slightly, hence not a full 5 stars is the disabled toilet.  It's at the back of the café downstairs and although accessible with plenty of room inside to turn a wheelchair, it can be tricky to get to if people haven't tucked their chairs in. It can also be quite cool in the café, not sure if this is due to air conditioning or not but chilly in there, even when its hot outside."
1183,"easy to get to good bus links and 5 minutes from the train station. leaflet for the distillery give good directions 
not so easy to access as there are three stairs the navigate. didn't see any other entrance for disabled people
"
1184,The staff were good and helpful.
1185,We travelled by rail to Haymarket and then a 15min walk to the Theatre. Be sure to cross onto the left hand side of Morrison Street as the drop down kerbs are a bit dodgy further up on the right hand side. I did spot blue badge parking spaces directly opposite the entrance. 
1186,Only difficulty could be some doors are heavy but glass frontages enable you to attract staff for help if needed. 
1187,Staff were helpful and offer various visual and auditory tours with 'acting' from staff which may be noisy experiences.
1188,"Easy to find, easy to buy tickets, decent accessible loo!"
1189,"Only found 2 in the entire centre and one is up a very steep, long ramp."
1190,"All the staff were very helpful and friendly. I was accompanied in the lift up and down to the state reception rooms by a member of staff.

The only reason this didn't score 5 was the lack of visible staff on the 1st floor when I was wanting to descend the lift to exit. "
1191,large car park with a few Disable parking bays near the front door .. Bus Service stops at the ASDA store across the road 
1192,"I have now made 3 visits to this Branch which has installed the Welcome App and have moved bank accounts to RBS as a result since my previous Bank did not have this facility and I am unable to queue, I no longer have to since requirements are known and help is given."
1193,"All very friendly and kind, willing to support you all the way."
1194,Wheelchair accessible restaurant with excellent service and first class food. 
1195,"The accessible entrance to this venue can be found round the back, and is a single, manual door that isn't particularly heavy. Immediately to the left is a platform lift to go down into the venue. The platform lift does require rotating 90 degrees between getting on an off, but is large enough to accommodate this, even for a powered wheelchair.
The tables and chairs are spaced far enough apart to move between them, and the majority are at a comfortable height to reach from the wheelchair. Most of the chairs are easily moved to açcommodate wheelchairs too.
Some of the bars and street food vendors have high counters, and with the music it can be difficult to communicate with staff. However, the staff are extremely friendly and welcoming, and seem well trained at handling disability.
I wasn't there for too long so didn't use the bathroom, but I believe the disabled toilet lacks full changing facilities.
There are several bus stops and taxi ranks close to the venue, and the train station is about half a mile away, making it easy to get to on public transport. However, nearby car parking is extremely limited. The pavements surrounding the venue have large cobbles, so can be bumpy or slippy, but are perfectly passable."
1196,"Everyone loves a trip to Ikea. You'll end up buying things you never knew you needed. What's better is that it's wheelchair accessible with disabled parking, changing places and spacious restaurant."
1197,"The staff were brilliant and were happy to shake things up to accommodate us. 
They were brilliant! "
1198,"Initially my friend had gone to the cinema in person to book the tickets. She informed staff specifically that I had a disability and asked about the accessibility of the screen. She was lied to as she was informed it was accessible. When we arrived and our tickets checked the member of staff informed us where the stairs where. I asked about a lift. She informed me that the lift was out of order. I asked her how long it had been and she said about a month, but someone was there today fixing it (02/01/2020). She did not apologise and she didn't offer any support. I walked up 2 flights of stairs with handrails. They were not particularly difficult stairs but as we where in screen 2 we had to walk to the second floor and that took a lot out of my spoons. 

After the film my friend (thanks to her), spoke with one of the Managers called Lucas. She explained that she had specifically came into the cinema to book the tickets because she wanted to make sure they were accessible and although she had told them that her friend was disabled at no point did they inform her that the lift was out of order. I explained how I had been treated that day and the lack of awareness staff had shown. I also suggested putting photos of the venue on their website so disabled people can access for themselves if the venue is suitable to their needs. Lucas accepted these comments and said there was an issue about staff training and he would speak to his staff today. He also offered us a complementary drink. "
1199,So much better now they have a lift. The store needs to keep an eye on the aisles. Wide enough but sometimes the way merchandise is displayed creates barriers. 
1200,Fantastic wheelchair level access onsite dog grooming service in the city centre of Dundee.
1201,"The lower level is all on the flat, the toilet is of a good size. The space is good around the exhibit for a chair and the audio tour around the town is quite easy to menouvre. The staff are super helpful and are willing to take any research information from upstairs down to you if you want it. They seem to be quite focused on trying to be more accessible to all. 

Would 100% recommend 

Great for kids! "
1202,Level access into the takeaway but the counter is high up. Door is manual and there is no doorbell. There was no seating but I assume this is due to Covid precautions.  
1203,"Accessible toilet is at the back so if it is a sold out gig, it is very difficult to get to and from the wheelchair space."
1204,Wide door with level access. Standard counters. Space to manoeuvre. Cash machine outside at standard height. Post Box adjacent.
1205,"The parking and transport to the stadium was great! You could easily wheel yourself to the ground, the city of Bilbao is mostly flat. The stadium is also very well served by accessible public transport including Buses, Trams and Taxis, which all stop about 3 minutes away from the ground. "
1206,"Always wanted to go here but wrongly assumed it was inaccessible due to the steps at the front entrance on George Street. Turns out there is an accessible side entrance that staff open for you. You either call ahead, or assuming, you're not dining alone someone can pop up the steps and let them know. I toyed with idea of 4.5 stars for this reason, but since side entrances don't fuss me in the least and they have made such a concerted effort to be wheelie friendly on a largely un-wheelie friendly street, then they deserve the full whack! Oh, and the food's delish too! 

Buen Provecho......"
1207,"In advance of your visit, staff are more than happy for you to phone ahead to discuss your access needs. On arrival, the restaurant staff met us at the door and were extremely attentive and ready to help if necessary. As each course was served, serving staff explained what we were about to eat. In The Residence, a member of staff is normally on duty at reception between 8.30am and 8pm to assist if required and nothing appeared to be too much trouble during our visit."
1208,Fine.
1209,Very kind and helpful. Especially Susan
1210,"The Rival is in Mariatorget, a beautiful garden square. It has excellent public transport links. 

From Arlanda Airport, the easiest way is by the commuter train, as this will involve only one train to Sodra Train Station and then a 5 - 8 minute level walk, down one street until you reach the garden square at the end and then the hotel is on the right hand side of the square. There are 2 trains per hour to Sodra and the train journey takes about 40 minutes. This is the route I travelled by.

Please note that the trains to Sodra depart from Arlanda Central Station in Sky City, although you remain indoors, this is a quite a walk from the airport terminus. On the way from the airport I had special assistance, which was excellent, they took me to buy my ticket and then took me onto the platform and advised me of the time of my next train. On the way to the airport I didn't notice the assiatance call buttons at Arlanda Central Station and with my case and crutch it took me a good 10 minutes to walk to my terminal. I would advise if you book special assistance to make yourself known at Arlanda Central Station and wait for your assistance to arrive. The final thing to note about this route is that even if you have a pre-paid travel card you have to pay a supplement of 120 SEK (2019) to travel on this route. It was explained to me that this is because it is a train line owned by a different company and you pay an additional charge at the start or end of your journey to cover these charges. Please don't let this up you off, asit is the easiest way to travel.

The alternative from the airport is using the Arlanda  Express, it is nearer the airport terminal, and it leaves every 15 minutes and is quicker, taking 20 minutes. However it goes to Stockholm Central Station and from there you will need to change and use the local Metro. For the Metro from Stockholm City it is 3 stops to Mariatorget on the red line number 13 or 14. (The Metro is quite easy to use, each line has 2 numbers, one for each direction of travel, and additional numbers if the line splits, so you just need to know the direction you are making for and find what number that line is on, which I found easier than than trying to remember the names).  Mariatorget Metro station is literally round the corner from the hotel. It's on the same road as Sodra station but nearer to the hotel, with a two minute walk.

For both the commuter trains and Metro there were lifts (Hiss in Swedish) and in the carriages there were priority seats. I didn't notice any designated wheelchair spaces but I was always making for the nearest carriage, so I feel unable to comment on that. On board there are announcements in Swedish, and occassionally in English, there is also a board in each carriage and an announcment fro the next stop. The board shows or announces nasta (which is Swedish for next) and then it says the stop. Public transport is excellent and frequent.


"
1211,"If you are worried about access to this widely established chain restaurant please don't be. My father is wheelchair bound currently which meant we required help and proper disability access to it. The staff couldn't have been better with us assuring us in advance that they had a ramp into the restaurant (albeit a mobile ramp).  They helped us out of the taxi and had the ramp awaiting. They could not have been more helpful and indeed respectful. In terms of the food - I'd recommend the steal frites (although I'm pretty sure most guys would go for that anyway). Being thin it's easy to over cook the steak but it was both tender, juicy and served with confidence which was most enjoyable. They have a good selection of food, drinks and access to disabled toilet all of which are very important for disabled people. Although this is a chain and could be discounted very quickly we enjoyed our dinner very much and the staff were very efficient. WELL DONE COTE !!"
1212,There is a large carpark as Hollywood Bowl is located at Glasgow Springfield Quay so there are also restaurants. We managed to park directly outside the entrance.
1213,"The nearest tube stations are Holborn, Covent Garden or Charing Cross. Unfortunately none of which are step free. The restaurant is on the Aldwych so there are many buses that stop directly outside or close to the restaurant. "
1214,"We went as a work night out - a big party of about 12 which included 3 powerchair users and a manual wheelchair user. This was no problem at all, the table which we were seated at had loads of space. The staff were absolutely brilliant (including the complimentary Prosecco!). The accessible loo as clean and spacious. Overall an amazing experience and some of our party have already been back (several times)!

A great place to go for a pizza before the cinema or in a convenient location for lots of other activities too. 

And really really delicious food - my pizza was just sublime! Certainly gives other pizza places a run for their money! There is a really extensive menu - nearly too much to choose from!"
1215,"We approached staff at the entrance to the SEC and were let through the end door (with the disabled access tickets you don’t need to wait in line). The security guy at the door was super friendly and jovial, a good start! Getting in was easy with level access throughout. We looked for hall 3 but couldn’t find it marked, we walked past a few doors before asking a fellow gig-goer who pointed us to it, there weren’t many staff about. We entered the hall and a staff member came and said they’d lead us over, I wanted to go to the merch stand but they hadn’t asked any questions and started walking. We followed to the far end of the room to a raised platform with two long ramps at each side. My tickets each had seating/area numbers so I was disappointed when told it was first-come-first-serve and we were lined up rows, making it difficult to see past those in front. Another person was arguing this point also as the person they were supporting was in a very low chair and would not have been able to see, the staff wouldn’t budge though. 
The stage was situated in the middle of the room (at the wall) and we were so far to the side I didn’t really feel part of the gig and struggled to see well. There were no screens like in the hydro."
1216,An accessible toilet is adjacent to the lower area of the cafe / coffee shop.
1217,There were steps and a lift.
1218,Nearby free parking with disabled bays
1219,"The staff were very accommodating and friendly, they supported us well with our use of AAC and took the time to show us around the building, and listening to our opinions. 
"
1220,"There was minimal signage but it's all clear and easy to find, there's no hidden access or any stairs or trip hazards to negotiate. The floor space between the tables was more than wide enough for my wheelchair and the walker we had with us. "
1221,"Green Park station is nearby and is fully step-free, BUT check before you travel, as the lifts at this station are notoriously and disgracefully unreliable. 

Several bus routes run up and down Piccadilly and will drop you off nearby."
1222,"For a small venue in a cobbled area of Leith, I was pleasantly surprised by Harmonium's disabled access! The vegan restaurant has an impressively large and varied menu, and the atmosphere is perfect for after-work drinks or a catch up with friends. "
1223,Very straightforward into and around the hotel. We didn't go to the restaurant though.
1224,"There are two entrances, one of them has a small step but the other one is level (Museums Street entrance). The glass door isn't automatic so wheelchair users might need assistance, however once inside there is quite a lot of space to move around. It's fairly small but spacious. 

The counter unfortunately doesn't have a dropped counter and is fairly high. However the staff are very friendly. 

Seats and tables are easily moved so the space can be configured for different people's needs."
1225,Bar with great wheelchair access
1226,Great! The shop had displays at different heights and was easy to manouvre around in. The cafe was spacious and it was easy to move chairs to suit ourselves. 
1227,"The entrance is down a wide alley to the side of the restaurant. It is flat but a little uneven. There is a tiny step to the front door - 5 cm high. They saw me coming though and brought a ramp out. Probably one of the best portable ramps I've ever used. The restaurant has multiple levels but we were on the main floor and they gave us a table with plenty of room for 4 adults and my assistance dog. 

Absolutely nothing to do with access, but the meal was really tasty! "
1228,"Rather cramped if carer & wheelchair user + chair have to get in. No useful grab rails just one small upright & a drop,down that  didn't really help.. Mission could be accomplished but with lots of  lifting & support by carer."
1229,"A pleasant break taken here to look over hotel, and check out a modern up to date Spa,  while enjoying a drinks break.

This is part one of reviews here, do read part two, the Spa.

The ancient Hatherley Manor,s history began way back in 1022, and a 1086 survey 
tells us that the estate was being held by a Edmar, a Thane, who held it during the reign of Edward the confessor. It is not really known how long the land was under 
control of the Crown, but it is known that in 1311 it was held by Sir John de Bosworth 
but then passed on to Sir John Willoughby de Broke in 1491.
The Manor then passed through several families, before becoming the possession of Sir Matthew Wood, who was twice the Lord Mayor of London.
During the mid 19th century, Anthony Gilbert Jones, a man who was the Mayor of Gloucester on three occasions, possessed the Manor, and his seventh son and youngest, patented the Hatherley Lattisteps, called today, a stepladder.It was also the Jones family company of Jones and co that made plans for the mass production of deckchairs.
During the time of the Jones family in the Manor, and later on, extensive refurbishments changed the estate very much.
Then this old now 17th century house had additions added to it in the late 18th century, and again in 1983 through 86, when it first became a small hotel, but still retained that look of an imposing country court house, and its history can still be seen in the reception area, the restaurant, beams room and Swallows suite.

The hotel stands in a 37 acre parkland, surrounded by mature gardens, with a walled garden and an orchard. 
Today, there is only one bedroom that has special needs facilities, with low level light
Switches, low sinks, high toilet, pull cord, with a low level access bath with shower in it.  The door in the corridor is wide enough to allow a wheelchair to get in, but if this has been taken, then beware that there is no lift in the hotel, so let them know your needs before you book a room.
All areas on the ground floor, lounge, the restaurant, are easily accessible and not far from public toilets. There are 56 en-suite berooms available.

After driving along through flat areas of farmland for crop growing (photo 1) we finally arrived at Hatherley Manor hotel, (photo 2) about as inspiring as the tedious drive just undertaken, just a two storey plain red brick building, nothing to write home about, no gardens in sight, just an open lawn like frontage, very disappointing.
Opposite the single line parking area in front of the hotel, with no disabled bays, we went to enter the very dull plain hotel entrance (photo 2) and entered a very plain unassuming reception area, feeling rather let down at that moment (photo 3).
However, things did perk up a bit as we sat down in the bar lounge for a coffee break (photo 4) before exploring the rest of the hotel. Next to the bar, a warm looking pink red room with nice places to sit (photo 6) was inviting, with a doorway leading off to the restaurant, which was a pleasant, nicely decorated, tastefully done dining area (photo 7) with a small alcove available with four tables and chairs (photo 8) for a more intimate dining experience. 
Back out of restaurant in the pink room, a lovely open fireplace, with neatly stacked log piles looked cosy enough (photo 9) with a homely look.
At the far end of the bar lounge (photo 10) we spotted the entrance to the toilets and a corridor lead to the Spa, Bedrooms and toilets (photo 11) but we found no disabled toilet, just the Lords and Ladies public guest toilets (photo 12) which were clean and tidy, but no pull cord or grab rails, and I had to leave wheelchair out in the corridor to be able to use the facilities.
Coming out of the toilet (photo 13) the corridor continues ahead ( photo 14) and lead to the Hatherley function suite (photo 15) but that was not at all inspiring, so we returned to the bar and enjoyed a glass of wine. (photo 16).

Our final thoughts.
Interesting, but uninspiring, nothing to look at, but at least it was to a certain extend, wheelchair friendly, but we will not be returning. 

Let’s hope now, that after all the hype it’s been given that our next review for the hotels Spa will be more interestng. Please read the review to see what we felt.
"
1230,There is step free access to the restaurant although you do have 2 steps to go up in the back part of the restaurant. 
1231,"The disabled access to the main part of grand central is mainly via lifts from the train station, however there are also connectors from the bullring and the city centre that are via ramps or flat surfaces, meaning they are easily accessible. 
There is shopmobility available for people to use when they visit grand central via the main car park, am unsure if there is a cost attached as did not personally use during our visit. 
Grand central is a flat surface with seating and places to rest should people require it. "
1232,See Pic.
1233,There was a lot which was handy.
1234,"Toilet fully accessible,  plenty of grab rails and plenty of room to manoeuvre a wheelchair"
1235,"I have booked many ‘accessible ‘ rooms since an accident and this was perfect. I had a wet room with all the handles in the correct place. There was a fitted folding seat at the shower which was invaluable. Wheelchair users would easily be able to use too. 

Used the pool and it has both steps and a ladder. Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. Was able to access hot tub and sauna/ steam room.  

Best accessible room I’ve found in years. "
1236,"Excellent tour around the studios, with the tour guide sharing snippets of history and experiences, and there are tour included a trip into Radio Scotland studio as it was broadcasting live and the visit to the set for the news is broadcast."
1237,"The accessible toilet is at the back. It would be fine but for several really bad problems. (1) The red emergency cord is much too short, useless to anyone who falls to the floor. (2) Big bins block the wheelchair transfer area. (3) The doorknob for releasing the door to get out of the toilet cubicle is much too high on the door for many wheelchair users - a particularly stupid piece of design. For all three problems, see my attached pictures."
1238,"To my mind there weren't enough of them about - but there was help with doors, seats & programmes  (although there isn't always someone in the lift which is a black mark!)"
1239,"This accessible lodge was amazing. Exceptionally well equipped for people with disabilities without a clinical feel, also friendly and very helpful owners. Basically can't praise it enough."
1240,"A new tasting room with platters of food available and stunning views.  Disabled parking was well placed and access to the shop was very good.  There is a lift to take you to the tasting room and accessible toilets were available.  The only downside is that full access to the tour is not possible, which is understandable in a working distillery.  The ease of access and available facilities made the whole experience enjoyable and stress free."
1241,"The centre has excellent accessible facilities.  I arrived using their Silk Street entrance, which is at street level, and slopes gently into the centre of the complex. There was step free access throughout my entire visit, with automatic main doors and lifts.
I visited Cinema 1 which is on level -2. When I exited the lift there was a foyer with seating area and ticket desk, at standing height. 
There are 2 step free boxes at the rear of the auditorium and directly accessible from the foyer. I was in box B. It had a private entrance, with 2 manual doors. Inside the box were 2 free standing chairs, it was spacious and would accommodate a wheelchair user. There was an excellent uninterrupted view of the screen. It is secluded and private, so I felt confident storing my crutch and knowing it wouldn't be in anyone's way. I felt like royalty. All the other seating in Cinema 1 involves steps with a single handrail.
There is an induction loop in the auditorium.
Assistance dogs are permitted in the cinema but there is also the option to leave them with a member of staff.
They have access film screenings with both audio description and captioned film in the same screening. Also relaxed screenings."
1242,"The manager in particular is exceptionally friendly and helpful, communicating by text, describing things well, orienting me etc."
1243,Access to the store is fine but once inside there’s split level on the ground floor and stairs only to 1st floor
1244,"Door opens inwards and either side of the loo are sanitary bins, so you cannot reverse alongside to transfer easily. Hand washbasin  not in reach when on loo. Red cord  cut off   at approx waist height when sat down, so anyone on the floor could not reach to summon help."
1245,head of security
1246,Disabled toilet on ground level but need code to gain entry
1247,"There is level access into The New Harbour Café, the door does need to be manually opened however when I visited the door was open. The door is also wide enough for a wheelchair to get through.

Most of the tables in the café are booths with a table leg at the edge so a wheelchair would not be able to sit at it. There was a long table at the door which had a long booth seat at one side of the table and moveable seats at the other side. When we visited the moveable seats were piled up to the side to allow a wheelchair to easily get access. Now I don’t know if this was a coincidence or if they have this set up for wheelchair user, mobility scooter users and prams. Anyway, it was really handy and if it is the latter reason then it’s good they think about this. The table was also at a good height for me in my wheelchair.

With me being with my helper, she went up to order our food because there wasn’t much room. If I had to go up myself I would have managed, but there was no need for me to."
1248,StayCity Edinburgh's serviced apartments are located in a quiet side street in the Fountainbridge area of the city. There are buses running along one of the adjacent streets and it’s only a short ten-minute walk through to Haymarket and its transport hub.
1249,"Lothian Buses 16, 22, 35 and 34 stop right outside it. It is a few minutes walk from the shore."
1250,"There are no steps into the main building and there are two disabled toilets - one inside - and one outside. Part of the picnic area is not accessible at the moment but work is in progress right now (10th August 2015) which will redress this problem soon. (Author's recommendation).

There is a stretch of gravel pathway before meeting the boardwalk which can be bypassed by allowing disabled drivers to drive close to the boardwalk by speaking to someone in the information centre or by mobile telephone from the car. The boardwalk from then on circles all permitted areas of the reserve."
1251,Car Park at Venue
1252,"Lovely place to visit.  The Staff go out of their way to help as much as they can.  There is a lift into the venue but it isn't an obstacle as the Staff will assist where needed.  
"
1253,"The staff and volunteers are always very helpful and cheerful, they all knew what Disabled Access Day was and give the information that was needed to go with  it."
1254,The staff in the museum and cafe were fantastic. They helped make sure I was able to get an accessible seat in the cafe and answered any questions we had. Great service!
1255,"Speak three languages, great for demonstrations, knowledgeable and helpful."
1256,"They have tried and there is a disabled entrance, but its on the other side of the building from the car park and has an awkward gate to contend with.  Plus you need to get the attention of a staff member to let you in.  The step at the main door is a little high and the doors are hardwood for a crutches/stick user."
1257,"Bus drops people off at bottom of road so there is a half mile tarmac trek to reach the trail. Two disabled parking spaces down the hill (ignore first two car parks) and this opens out on aforementioned bumpy track to resrvoirs. If you use the bottom car park instead you will have a short, fairly steep climb to the disabled entrance on a tarmac surface."
1258,"To get into M&Co there is level access, the door does need to be opened manually however, it was opened when we visited so there were no problems. Inside the shop was very spacious an I was able to easily drive around all the clothes racks.

When I visited the lift was out of order and when we asked if there was another way to get to the other levels, we were told there wasn’t. However, whilst exploring Lerwicks town centre later on we found a back door that allowed you to visit the level below the one we were on previously. This level again was quite spacious."
1259,"CAR PARKING
Car parking (blue badge) is possible on Sinclair Street (opposite the North Stand).   However this fills up rapidly, so early arrival is recommended.  High density housing in the area means that street parking is very restricted (even with a blue badge) 
LEAVING THE CARPARK
This is a busy part of Leith and there can be unavoidable traffic congestion"
1260,"Specsavers is generally fairly accessible throughout. Level entrance. The front door is 830mm wide, expandable to 1670mm, but is a push door and fairly heavy to open. There is no bell or knocker for assistance. There is a mobile hearing induction loop. There are test rooms on the lower floor accessible only by stair, but also test rooms on the ground floor. Test room door is 900mm wide and is designed for wheelchair use. The till height is 890mm"
1261,Ample Accessible Toilets
1262,Very friendly and approachable
1263,Tremendous and could have not been more thoughtful and supportive in every way.
1264,"There is disabled parking 50 yards away in St Sampson's Square.
Bus routes run into the city centre with stops within 1/4 of a mile depending on bus route. All First buses have wheelchair access."
1265,"The entrance is step-free, there's an accessible toilet, it's easy to get around the café and the staff are zealous in their attempts to be helpful.  Definitely worth considering as a place to go if you're a wheelchair user, despite my negative comments below."
1266,"My Branch merged with Bruntsfield which was positive in many respects in there being a power assisted Door, all on one level, it’s wheelchair accessible with designated counter assistance - which is lower. The downsides, it’s further to get to, not enough staff to meet demand. There are 2 outside ATM’s, plus 4 inside with deposit facility, one ATM is lower than the others. There is a coin depositor also.
Staff recognise different requirements and act accordingly, It s located on the north City bound corner of Bruntsfield Terrace and Montpelier, it’s a busy main road in and out of the city, there is ample parking and excellent bus service provision."
1267,The landlady is a young women with an attractive personality. She could not have been more helpful.
1268,"The former railway line to Vincennes was transformed in the 1990s into a linear garden and walkway which stretches for 4.7km from a start near the Place de la Bastille in the heart of the city to the Square Charles Péguy. Much of the traIl is elevated and offers fine views of this part of Paris, and most of the route is wheelchair accessible. The sections that have been turned into a linear garden are beautifully planted. The eastern part of the traIl is shared with cyclists. There are a couple of road crossings but these presented no difficulties. There are two lifts to enable wheelchair users to access different sections of the trail. The start at the Place de la Bastille end is not wheelchair accessible, but the short wheel/walk along the Avenue Daumesnil past the workshops and studios of thr Viaduc des Arts is very interesting. Turn left into Rue Hector Malot and you will find the first/last lift access to the trail."
1269,The Intu Centre has an information desk which is located on the ground floor where help can be provided and questions can be answered if needed. 
1270,Plenty of buses!
1271,"We travelled by train as by bus would involve a LOT of stairs from the bridge down or a long walk from park and ride. By train it's a short walk downhill all the way. No issue with uneven kerbs from the station, through the car park and down the flat path to the doors. The staff at the entrance know their stuff and are welcoming. All the staff throughout the venue are happy to help wherever they can, refreshing in an age of disconnected employees dreaming of their break! The venue is really accessible, right through to the seal pool which is outside and ramped with ridges in case of wet weather (I love when places think about the safety aspect of Scottish weather, this means it's always safe to go rather than a wheelchair user being left behind). The layout of the whole internal exhibit is clear and you can wander at your own pace and backtrack to repeat anything, I find there's always something I miss or want to see again so this works for me. The information about the creatures is easy to read and relevant. Tanks and such were not too high or too low to see what was going on. The handling tanks are up a small ramp but it's worth it to be able to touch starfish etc at times which are stated as you enter. The education room has talks and allows you to see other creatures up close and the staff made the effort to bring the creatures around so everyone could see rather than just those who could get to the front. The disabled toilet had enough room for my manual chair but I'm a little concerned about larger chair (I used to have bariatic, I'd have struggled with that) or powerchair (no turning space I feel) grab rails were there though for transferring. The cafe is accessible and tables not so close you have to make everyone play musical chairs to get in which is always a relief. The shop which is always where my kids make a bee line for also had enough space for me to get my chair round and the counter was low level so I could see the cashier and reach for myself. One of the things I was worried about was the moving walkway (which clearly states no buggies) my manual chair fit safely but again a powerchair may have struggled to get around the bends easily. I put my brakes on to go round and could use my phone to take pictures without having to focus on controlling the chair, being so close to sharks and rays is amazing and an experience worth the trip all on its own. We did the tunnel/walkway part twice on our trip as it's so good and saw different things each time. The whole attraction is low level lighting but the floor is smooth and solid which helps, in one part of the tunnel it's even darker which adds to the drama but is worth knowing. There are staff visible pretty much all the time which I find a relief rather than having to look for them if needed. Having put off going based on my own worry my family are already keen to add this to our regular visit list as we felt well looked after, valued and safe. "
1272,"All the external doors have automatic opening buttons, however these are fairly regularly out of order. The doors are extremely heavy without these. There is lift access to all floors, however the Singing Lift is very hard to find on Level One, and needs some signage. The lifts become very slow during peak times."
1273,They always make sure there are blue badge spaces but the better stations for this are Sheffield park and east grinstead  (although I've never parked at east grinstead). Horstead Keynes always allow for disabled passengers but these are just an area for disabled only parking not marked bays. There are a couple of carriages with a lift from platform to train and kitted out with space for wheelchairs and fold up chairs for your family to sit with you and enjoy the views. It is worth phoning ahead to make sure you can catch these trains to make the most of your visit. 
1274,"As mentioned we parked on double yellow lines with the blue badge on West Street, but if we had entered West Street from Kings Road then we could have driven into The Mall car park without a problem.  By driving to the lowest level to park one would only have to cross the road into The Centre."
1275,2 bays
1276,"Host lives locally, and came within a few minutes when we needed assistance.  Nothing seems too much trouble for him."
1277,Don't think there was any. 
1278,The staff were helpful and friendly. Happy to answer my questions and offer assistance where they could.
1279,"This excellent gastro pub/restaurant is part of a chain of 3 - http://www.thegrumpymole.co.uk. I visited the Brockham restaurant near Betchworth which is set on the edge of the village green. There is wheelchair access at the rear which is sign posted but you need to ask someone to open the rear door for you. This was not a problem as I rang in advance. Friendly service, excellent food cooked to order from an extensive and varied menu, 3 disabled parking spaces and an accessible toilet.  You need a car to visit"
1280,Staff brilliant - in particular when we were rearranging furniture. Attentive but not intrusive.
1281,All the staff were very helpful and came to let us know as soon as they had got the glass lift going.
1282,There are accessible toilets throughout the gallery.
1283,A small intimate venue that is open daily to have a look around to see what the caves of Marera looked like when people lived in them but it also transforms into a venue for musical performances and talks at other times too. 
1284,Borough Market provides a labyrinth of market stalls selling food and beverages to explore and enjoy. It's fairly level access with the odd cobblestone to negotiate.
1285,The  Glyptoteket is in the city centre. There are many buses that stop directly outside. The buses and metro in Copenhagen is accessible. The gallery is next door to Tivoli.
1286,Lots of well equipped disabled toilets.
1287,"Departure lounge at airport was generally ok until you reach the accessible loo in non-schengen area where the uk travellers are corralled.  
The space is tiny,  basic wheelchair could fit in but someone outside needs to close the door.  But then w.c. Can only be used by holding the grab rails and climbing over the chair which now uses all the space.  No emergency cord.  
Extricating yourself back into chair a call then has to be responded too to assist in leaving the area.
Awful.  "
1288,Parking 15 feet from entrance and 50 feet from exit approx. No public transport.
1289,"We arrived by car as the Safari Park is set a few miles outside of Stirling. We followed the signs, paused at the ticket booth and the headed for the accessible parking area. Plenty of bays and all of them well marked out with ample room to deploy wheelchairs on either side of the vehicle. We thought the location of the accessible parking was also well thought out as it was close to most things and adjacent to the toilets."
1290,"The front door has “CODEBASE” in big letters, these open automatically. When inside at first there is the main reception area which has a small couch to wait in. To the left there is a door through to the toilets and on the right is the large events space which has heavy glass doors. Toilets and spaces are clearly signposted and there are visible stickers on glass doors. To get into the main space and further into offices you need a swipe card. These doors I find quite heavy."
1291,Lots of stairs.  Take crampons.  It’s a listed building.  I think the owners are hiding behind this.
1292,"There are two great changing place toilets within the Capability Scotland building, these are fully equipped with a hoist, bench and privacy curtain. Toilet is placed in the center of the wall which means that if you are able to transfer yourself.

The only problems I had were that I couldn't reach the lock and open button for the door with the toilet because the radiator was in the way, but I would have someone with me to help, not sure if others in wheelchairs would manage. Also I struggled to reach the sink. But I am delighted there are more changing place toilets available, it is open 9am until 5pm Monday till Friday."
1293,"There are accessible toilets within this venue designated for public use but the toilet is not for the sole use of disabled people.
There is tactile and pictorial signage on or near the toilet door. The accessible loo is near the main entrance on the main corridor to the left of the main entrance. There is level access to the accessible toilet and everywhere else :)"
1294,"There is a beefy mobility scooter or tramper which can be booked in advance, for free, for half a day at a time.  This made a massive difference to access, I could get nearly everywhere.  I was given a map with appropriate routes, and was able to explore through the meadows and woodland."
1295,Excellent
1296,"The double doors at the entrance made it difficult for me to get in because one of the doors was closed. There is a very small step up into the stop, nothing that should bother most wheelchair users, more of a bump. Most ground floor bookshelves can be reached in a wheelchair. Half of the bookshop is in the basement, which is reached via a staircase and there is no lift."
1297,Each room had an ensuit and with showers or baths. One of the baths had a lift in it so anyone could get in and out easily 
1298,"If you are coming from the high street then there will be a steep slope as you enter the centre but apart from that, it should be nice and easy. You can get a lift down to the bottom floor if needed."
1299,Uneducated about disabilty and quite frankly quite ignorant
1300,There are two disabled spaces available on site.  The hotel is situated on the riverside and is fairly centrally located in Inverness.  The bus and train stations are about a 10 minute wheel away; there are taxis available outside the train station.  There is also on-street parking available outside the hotel. 
1301,"All the internet photos of hotel excited us enough to want us to visit this hotel, and approaching it looked very nice from the road, (photo 1) but what a disappointment for us, it is now tired looking, still in need of maintenance and a good paint job to try to brighten the place up. The approach towards hotel was not appealing enough for us (photo 2) and although a decent sized car park, (photo 3) the only disabled bays we could see where alongside the disabled chalets, but at least we could park close 
enough to hotel entrance (photo 4). This has quite a steep ramp leading into hotel, but my wife who is my carer,  managed to push me up into hotel. The entrance to hotel is very basic, and reception area not at all inspiring (photo 5) Warmly greeted by friendly staff who did all they could to help us. Inside, the lounge had table and chairs, but no sofas to lounge on, and this serves as the bar area as well, (photo 6) big enough to get wheelchair around though. Lounge areas looked acceptable but did not excite us at all, The bar itself functions, (photo 7) but we had a nice cup of coffee. The restaurant again was very basic, nothing inspiring. (Photo 8) with pleasant seating under windows. (9) 
If you like us are just visiting, then we need to use the public toilets, and you reach this down a very steep ramp, ( photo 10, the photo is misleading as it does not show how steep the ramp really is )  You cannot get a wheelchair in there, so I had to get up out of my wheelchair to be able to push open the door (11) and get into the toilet area, but it is just an ordinary toilet, with no disabled amenities  available, so no grab rails or pull cord, (12)  and I was concerned as it smelt a bit and I felt it needed cleaning, so in no way was I going to use the toilet. Going outside into corridor again, was of concern, with a very steep ramp to get up to bar area, and as I had gone to toilets on my own, it was a very hard struggle to get up ramp, so if you have to use toilet then have help to get you up inside hotel again.
There are terrace areas to enjoy, but disabled could not use these areas, as steps to get up and down (photo 13) 
There are disabled chalets available as separate from main hotel (photo 14) a good idea, with parking right outside your chalet, but they badly need redecorating and maintenance on the outside, the present grey colour does nothing to give appeal, it’s just a functional colour they used. there is a step to get up into narrow doorway, so you may need to get out of chair so that carer can help you get inside, then fold the chair up to carry in, but it will be difficult to find space to store it. The room itself is small and very little storage space. The bed is a standard double bed size, (photo 15)
With a small open fronted wardrobe and a plain desk, with tea making facilities on it. (Photo 16). And the only other room is a walk in shower room and W.C (17).
Our final thoughts.
It was disappointing for us, as it looked so nice from the road, we were hoping for more. Restaurant and bar are very basic, uninspiring, simple bar like areas. The public toilets was of concern and care will be needed. The chalets are very small and basic, and we feel we would not be able to use this hotel ourselves with our need to use a wheelchair. 
"
1302,"Easily accessed via bus, no parking as it is central London"
1303,One disabled space nearby on street.  Parking in nearby Lidl if you make a purchase in store.
1304,"There was a good size accessible toilet with grab rails it was very clean and the lighting is good and will come on as you enter the toilet. 
The Toilet is on the ground floor level area past the café and is on the left hand side as you go towards the toilet 
The only issue was that the red cord was short and by about 2 feet from the floor a Red cord card is in place "
1305,Other than being very busy and being tired by sigh we got on asking for help with the tray. Two staff members working on a very busy day is not good enough. I give the low score because she gave a sigh and told us to maybe come back on a day they were not busy. Not happy it made us feel that the disabled should not go on a Saturday as it’s to busy and we are to slow.
1306,"The disabled toilet is a reasonable size. It's cleaner than toilets at most British services. It has grab rails, a suitable bin and a changing table (though it's unsuitable for anyone larger than a small child)."
1307,Not very helpful their stand and stare instead of trying to help you. 
1308,Most staff particularly helpful. They recommend phoning to book and mentioning chair/scooter so a comfortable table is reserved.
1309,Great live music venue. Good view from access area. You do have to use a side entrance but otherwise all good. Staff went over and above to help us. 
1310,Fully accessible bathroom upstairs (use lift to access)
1311,easy right outside reception
1312,"The loos are spacious enough, with the grab rails and space that I needed. There is an accessible loo on the ground and first floor areas which house the hot-desking and the cafe area. "
1313,"The farm has four cottages available with a very number of rooms each. We stayed in the Lavander cottage, with had 2 rooms.  My husband has a MND and the cottage was equipped with a chair/commode with wheels, a wet room, a profiling bed and also gave us the contacts to hire a hoist. 

The location was very peaceful, and they also have a hot tub! 
They have few chickens and ducks and the owners are lovely.

It's also very dog friendly. We have a lab who spent the evenings on a nearby irrigation lake swimming with the ducks!

It was our first holiday in a year, and it all worked so well that we will go back for another visit in August."
1314,The staff were helpful and friendly and provided great customer service.
1315,Wide doorways throughout.  No steps.  Wooden decking path right around the building.  Ceiling hoists.
1316,"The accessible toilet was great! Smooth ramp up, huge space, even with a shower! I didnt see a changing places toilet though and you would NOT want to change someone on those floors. "
1317,5 minute walk from Exchange Square. Several accessible bays in street outside. 
1318,"Climbing the highest free-standing mountain in the world is not advisable for anyone who is not completely mobile and independent, however, I wasn't going to let that stop ME! I am a quadruple amputee wearing two prosthetics legs (below knee) and  had Kili in my sights before my sepsis struck in 2013.  I seem to be on a path of ensuring I don't miss out despite my 'disabilities' so I talked myself into trying, knowing I might fail but  convincing myself that not trying was much, much  worse.  With the help of some superb mountain experts in Julius White and his team of 33 porters from  Ahsante Tours, I got there, all the way to the top at 5895 metres, as did all 11 climbers in my group (non amputees). These are spectacular results as I know a percentage of every group don't summit - credit to Julius and his team. I think it is a lot do with their motivational singing!   We did the 'Rongai' route which seems to be the 'easiest' route (if there is such a thing) taking more days than others and therefore helping acclimatise and prevent altitude sickness. 

Firstly, the walking is steep and rugged in almost all areas and some 'steps' can be 2 feet high rocks and there are many of those, not just occasionally.  This is definitely not for wheelchairs, in my opinion,  unless they are mean beasts for all terrain purpose. The scree is more like sand near the top and so that would be an issue for chairs too.  I needed a lot of support and assistance just to make sure I didn't fall when I lost my balance. Not having feet and ankles means you don't correct your footing easily. 
Camping was very difficult for many reasons.  As I have no hands, zips can be tricky. Loose tent material makes pulling the zips even harder. We devised a method of attaching hair bobbles to the zips to pull with my stumps. Getting in an out the tent was hard enough with legs on - in fact I threw myself in, head first, (bum last) and I crawled out onto the scree on my knees (it is very dirty and dusty) and got myself up on to my feet with difficulty.  Trying to get prosthetic legs on at ground level is not easy and there is nothing to push against. I had a few panics when I wakened up during the night and talked myself in to needing the loo. I had worked out that it took me 15 minutes to get  my legs on before I tackled the zips (all in the dark with a headtorch in sub-zero temperatures) and staggered to the toilet tent to tackle another zip! No accidents fortunately! I negotiated a folding chair outside my tent to help put on my legs but that wasn't very stable or able to take much more weight than my 9stones. 

Lastly, the descent was always going to be my biggest problem. The jarring on my stumps had been very sore on my training climbs which involved about  2 or 3 hours descent. This was to be 2 and a half days descent.  I had the use of smart-crutches 
  which took the load but I was tearing my 'human'  legs apart. I finally agreed to be supported, carried and karted down in places. No-one cares how I got down do they? As long as I made it up! I struggled a lot with this as I am so fiercely independent and was mortified at letting porters carry me, sometimes in not so comfortable or glamorous  ways.  I tried to laugh at the indignity of it but deep down, I knew it was necessary and unavoidable if I wanted to not to do real, long term damage.  I had also agreed to do as I was told by the guides and although I tried hard to take them on, I knew Julius was boss! 
It is worth noting that I had some great friends with me and it was a team effort to get me and them safely to the peak and back down again.  I rarely had to fill my camelbak, put in water purification tables, pack my sleeping bag etc thanks to Nicola, my trusted colleague and everyone dished my dinner and made me tea, although I made sure they all knew I could actually do it myself!   My pride is important to me! 
Good luck if you take on Kilimanjaro. You'll need lots of inner-strength, pig-headed determination and huge supplies of Compeed!  She's a tough climb. "
1319,"As is normal with Maplin, the staff were really friendly and helpful, five stars well-deserved. The young man who helped me was willing to fetch from the store-room any number of items not displayed on shelves, nothing was too much trouble for him - what a sweetie."
1320,"Leisure centre reception staff very pleasant and friendly;
Innovate Trust staff and volunteers were very informative and friendly and not patronising!"
1321,Make booking over the phone and table was ready for us they even offered to take our orders at the table instead of the bar and also offered to collect our meals from the  carvery as well
1322,Ample parking and 6 blue badge spaces. 
1323,"very helpful staff opened doors for us, and when we were in the shop, delighted to find that it was laid out well and had wide aisles making it easy for wheelchair access. Manager noticed that Mum had stopped to rest her arms (as she was pushing herself) and even offered to help by pushing mum to the part of the shop she was interested in while I took charge of our dog. Gave us suggestions of suitable shoes and paid loads of attention to mum. Excellent!"
1324,"Everywhere is accessible but it might mean taking an alternative route - I went with a regular visitor who knew his way around, so you might need to ask or use a map.
You have to pre-book the scooters, which get booked up quickly, so if you need one its not a place to go for a spur-of-the-moment visit (hence the 3.5*)."
1325,Parked in castle car park. Fee payable even with blue badge but good location and easy to get to the castle
1326,"Good signage, level surface.  Ramps for all accessible areas we needed to get to.  Wide doors."
1327,"I visited this place after shopping for a coffee the staff was very helpful, there facilities was great easy seating area, a disable toilet and wheelchair accessible, the staff was very easy to talk to and really wanted to help there was nothing what was to much trouble for them,  great job to all the staff that was on that day.   "
1328,Very helpful staff on hand to welcome you. The chap who operates the stair climber particularly helpful. The rest of the staff that we spoke to were all very knowledgeable about their own areas of the house.
1329,"Friendly, happily carry your drink anywhere. If you can't reach payment points for cards, they'll bring things around."
1330,Very steep ramp and a bump at the top and I wouldn't of been able to get on the ship if some people I was with didn't lift the scooter over the bump. Acsess within the ship is good although there is many parts of the ship that a wheelchair user can't access
1331,"Well signposted accessible disabled toilets. Adequate room for carer. A bit careworn, but adequate and reasonably clean."
1332,Wonderful! Light airy & spacious... Lots of work has gone into making it a stylish and welcoming environment. Level access throughout. Dropped height reception desk.
1333,The staff were so friendly and it was so evident they have considered wheelchair access from the start. Couldn’t do enough to help and really helpful. 
1334,"There are not really very many of these considering the size of the town centre. 
These are the ones I know of: There is one in M&S (not locked), there is one in the Health Centre on Ashburner street (not locked), two in the Market place shopping centre one of which has a RADAR lock. 
There is a changing places facility at Bolton One which is a bit of a trek from the shops if you're desperate."
1335,Ramped access not too steep & lots of space to move about inside. There were 3 ways to access the pool. i used the shower chair & pool hoist. there was also a track hoist with a sling going directly into the pool from the changing room. there was a wide pool stairway with grabrails for those who find walking Difficult.
1336,Good large toilet with rails etc
1337,"The customer car park is unfortunately a loose stone surface, but there is on street parking right beside the entrance too. From the car park, there is a dropped kerb to a level access outside patio into the chocolate Lounge. From the street, there is a smooth, gentle stone path down to the door. "
1338,"Transport links are not great. The Holyrood Park entrance is within a modern housing estate and parking is for residents only. The nearest parking is on Holyrood Park Road, this is mostly single yellow line with some pay and display parking spaces.
At the Holyrood Park side the nearest bus stops are at the Commonwealth Pool on Dalkeith Road. The number 2,14, 30 and 33 buses go past here.
The Duddingston side ends at Duddingston Road West, there is a bus stop nearby called Cavalry Park, this used to be part of the 42 route, but I am not sure if that is still the case. Again, parking options aren't great on this side either. The best option for parking on this side is probably at Peffermill Industrial Estate."
1339,The staff were lovely. Happy to explain the menu and they had a sign stating they had gluten free and vegan options. 
1340,I can nly say that I saw two different disabled toilets on my visit but I did not use either and rtherefore feel unable to score properly.  The doors looked wide though.
1341,"There are plenty of parking spaces with about 4 directly outside of the hotel. Parking is free. There are buses into the centre of Cardiff at Cardiff Bay, including the sightseeing hop on\off bus,  at Cardiff bay, which have wheelchair access. There are also boat trips and a water taxi some of which have wheelchair access."
1342,The accommodation was spacious with lots of room for a wheelchair to manoeuvre. there were no steps to negotiate
1343,Level Access into the Soar centre itself with a lift up to the ski bar (Barvaria). Access to get out onto the slope itself is relatively accessible with only a small lip on the door which is quite easy to lift the chair over.    
1344,"We had reason to go to Dunelm, what an awful experience.
My husband could not get down most of he lanes as there were stands with goods in them all over the place, the lanes were narrowed down by these so access was not available to him. I complained to one of the staff and had this answered by 'do you want the manager'  no apology and no apathy shown.
I emailed to complain the answer I got was disgusting. The manager said he called and spoke to someone called andrew,which is the signature on our email.my husband had MND and could neither walk to the phone or answer it. I advised them of this and also the point that my husband could not speak."
1345,A couple of disabled spaces. Rough ground so bit bumpy in a wheelchair. 
1346,"From the mound entrance (ramps), disabled toilet is half way down the main gallery on the left, sharing a door with the gents. Loo is serviceable but small with a short alarm cord and along a short tightish corridor."
1347,"Was pleasantly surprised by how accessible this food venue was! Yes, it can get very busy which makes access a little trickier for everyone, but the fundamentals were there: step-free access, accessible loo, well-lit environment, movable benches at low tables, and very friendly staff."
1348,Great if you have a car. Very good parking. I don't know about public transport. Blackpool is 10 miles from the cottages.
1349,"The access for wheelchair users or using walking aids was good. Factory tour all on one level. A few slopes to go up/ down. Some cobbled areas outside leading to shops and factory tour. I was using a wheelchair and had someone with me who was pushing. The positive attitude of staff at the venue made it all seem easy, as they were willing and able to help with opening doors, etc. "
1350,Generally fine but again a bit too small for people with power chairs
1351,"Amazing experience. Climbing up at the O2 is not just for abled bodied people for disabled people as well.

Very accessible including toilets."
1352,Accessibility is first class and wheelchairs are welcomed as there is a special car  which is attached to the regular travel car which means the wheelchair user can remain in their wheelchair if they wish.  Booking is essential to ensure that there is a special car available. The exhibits can also be enjoyed as there is a lift to all floors.
1353,"This is a nice bar in the New Town with a good mix of people, from local residents to students.  The whole time I was there, I was thinking yes, this is really great and accessible then as I left I remembered the 150mm step at the front.  The beer is always a good mixture of ales, IPA's and lager. The Drygate was particularly tasty. 

The beer garden is nice but only when it's really sunny and the steps down is pretty accessible.

"
1354,"Excellent. The toilet used had various sized slings, hoist and a changing /washing area."
1355,"We walked but there is a large car park right outside the restaurant.
"
1356,"The lift was out of order on our visit, this why my rating is low. People in wheelchairs could only access the ground floor due to this.
Usually can use lift to access all four floors, also stairs to these.

Busy store, with people but also colours and music. Added to the atmosphere, but could be overwhelming for some."
1357,"The Projectionist is attached to  Soar at Braehead, a centre with various physical activities and a cinema. As a fairly new building, it has good access."
1358,"Kew Gardens Station is nearby and has manual boarding ramps on both Overground and Underground. Beware: if you want to travel away from the station westbound, you will have to go on a long detour through the back streets around the station to arrive step-free at the westbound platform. For buses, the 65 will drop you off outside the Victoria Gate at Kew Gardens."
1359,Venue is easy to navigate and is very accessible their is lifts from the high level to the low level 
1360,"Staff are incredibly friendly, treating you as they do every other customer. If you need help, they are more than happy to do everything they can for you."
1361,Really excellent and lots of staff members around. There was no confusion about how to access the wheelchair accessible seating. 
1362,"Jane and Stuart were helpful and friendly, offering advice when needed."
1363,"Staff in the café were friendly and helpful.
They was knowledgable and happy for me to ask about allergies when I asked about the ingredients in the soup.
When I spoke with the staff at customer services about the lack of accessible parking spaces I felt listened to."
1364,"There is no parking, disabled or otherwise at the venue but we arrived early enough to park quite close in a side street for free."
1365,"Brilliant. Alert staff, very sweet, wheelchair ramp produced immediately - full marks."
1366,"There are a large number of disabled parking spaces located around the front and back of the building, however there are a large number of non-badge holders who park here on a daily basis as they can't find other parking and find this acceptable"
1367,There is limited on street parking near by
1368,"This was a well planned, well presented and well conceived event in conjunction with PAMIS and Euan’s Guide for Disabled Access Day. Being old fashioned and a bit of a traditionalist, the Gallery it’s contents and exhibitions were not my cup of tea, though I was surprised and inspired by much of what I saw, experienced and able to appreciate. The NG of Scotland have made a really big statement on inclusion and accessibility by opening on this DAD a fully equipped Changing Places toilet to compliment their other disabled access facilities. The former John Watson School for girls is large, spacious and well laid out over 3 floors, the ground and upper being divided into halls and rooms for exhibits of paintings, sculpture and laid out works.  On the ground floor usage is made of the corridors as exhibit space leading to a well provisioned, well stocked shop, sales of exhibitors work   and accessible resource areas - this is where the PAMIS sensory storytelling took place.The lower floor is where the toilets are located and a wide accessibility cafe, there are lockers, a buggy and chair area available. The catering provision is Heritage Portfolio so the standards, range of foods of quality and service are high, as was the case. Overall a popular venue for its large outdoor areas, water features and it’s packed events guide throughout the seasons and the year. The cafe and the Gallery were populated by children of all ages and stages and there programmes for younger one and those a bit Oder that are learning, experiential and thought provoking. To say this is a venue I would return to would be understated, its fantastic, welcoming, attentive and available staff who are well informed and always on hand - recognising those with additional needs. "
1369,Bit of a bump to get in the front door but doable. Once you are in the bar itself is not built for people in wheelchairs.
1370,There was a lot of disabled parking which was very helpful.
1371,"There were two disabled loos, not radar key operated.
Sadly both had rail on one side of the WC only, had wash basin and hand dryer at ""normal"" height no rather than lowered for wheelchair user and, worst of all, no alarm cord. So no way of summoning help.
The third loo block at the far end of the site did not have a disabled loo, though was level access."
1372,"It was easy to park outside, but it is not on a bus route."
1373,Very limited wheelchair access. Reception has steps leading to it. The cat/small animal section has no turning space & narrow doors. My power chair is narrow with small turning circle and I got stuck. Would not recommend even attempting in a wheelchair. 
1374,Plenty of staff to help if required
1375,There is a great ramp from the car park to the main entrance. The ground floor of the hotel with the reception and the restaurant is all step free. Unfortunately the accessible room that we wanted to book was already booked however our room was spacious and staff were able to supply certain mobility aids to help. There was also mention of Hearing Loops and other information in the Guest Information. The lift was not massive but it was made better by the fact that you enter and leave by front & back doors so no need to turn around.
1376,"There are steps at the entrance to the Arena, there were two people standing at the bottom of them wearing  ""Happy To Help"" t shirts so I asked how to get in. One of the helpers took us round to the accessible entrance and we were met by another helper who called the lift and explained where to go when it arrived."
1377,Our room did not have an accessible bathroom 
1378,Access at the eastern end of the trail is by gently sloping ramp. It is also possible to join or leave the trail at the Jardin de Reuilly and there are two places in the western section of the trail wher lift access is available.
1379,Aesthetically this shell house is beautiful the way the shelves and the crystals are arranged is magical and obviously this place was incredibly special for someone in the past it is disabled accessible but there are no toilets for anybody and a car park it is quite boggy at this time of year. 
1380,There is a lot as disabled parking spaces around the hotel. I am not sure if there is public transport down to the hotel as I drove and the only thing that I would worry about if i hadn't is the train line that runs across the enternce of the Quay complex as I'm not sure my chair would have gone over it.
1381,"The baths are very accessible from a pay and display car park adjacent, though there are more than the usual number of disabled bay street parking bays nearby in the one way system. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Lots of audio and visual information.
The museum also, but if you wish to visit the 'barracks' and look at the armour you have to request external access via a fire escape door at 90 degrees to the path, which has a one inch threshold bar. A bit of a jolt for small wheeled scooters. Once inside an extremely enthusiastic young man will tell you all you need to know and help you try on helmets and armour, if you can lift it!! 
The amphiteatre which is directly accessible from the road is surrounded by grass which is cut short and there is scooter access into the arena. (Not recommended in wet weather) One information board and several notices.
Highly recommended. 
"
1382,"Whole venue is flat!! When enter, no steps or ramps, and has an automatic door.

Main central area very large, wide space to move in. Does have ticket machines but also a ticket desk. Also the usual refreshments sold.

Recognises the CEA card, so if you need a carer, they can accompany you for free. 

Within the cinema, our room had space for probably 4 or 5 wheelchairs - I'm not sure if every room is the same.

Different from other cinemas I've been in, the 'disabled spaces' are not all together in one area. There were some spaces (for 2 or 3 wheelchairs) at the back, and then individual spaces nearer the front but at the end of a standard row of seats. 

If you are going with a group of friends who also use wheelchairs, you might prefer to all be sitting together. However, if you are the only person using a wheelchair, you might prefer sitting amongst the rest of the audience like this. We liked that -unusually when using a wheelchair- you had the choice of being at the back or front of the cinema, you don't often get the option."
1383,There is a power-assisted door to the ground floor and lifts to all floors. I had to ask for directions to the restaurant as one of the many 'sale' signs which were hanging from the ceiling obscured signs for both the restaurant and the toilets. I also had to ask for help to find the lifts.
1384,"I parked adjacent to the restaurant, shop and disabled toilets"
1385,"The old original manor stood in the estate, before it was destroyed by fire.
In the 1920’s the estate was bought by James Guleeth Hill, and he re-sited Stone Manor, and completed his building work by 1926. He had it rebuilt in the Tudor style using Edwin Thomas Hall to design it. You can see proof of its date on the first tall chimney stack at the front of the building.

In 1936 the Manor was bought by Ernest Palethorpe, and his niece Dawn Palethorpe an Olympic equestrian stabled her horses at Stone Manor, and used the grounds to exercise her horses.
During the 1960’s Mr John Bright, a figure in the steel industry bought the house, but only remained here a few years before selling the Manor to Mr and Mrs Geoffrey Lamb, and they gained a licence to use part of the house as a country club. They then sold on very quickly so that in June 1970, Mr and Mrs Franco D’aniello bought the Manor, and under their care many alterations and extensions were built for them, before another large extension was added in 1979, which added another 17 bedrooms to the Manor.
In 1984 Mr Charles Wilfred Dunn bought the house and it’s 25 acres of land, and in 1985 another extension was built, providing more bedrooms, so that on its official opening day on 1st February 1989, 56 bedrooms were available. 

In 2015 Mr and Mrs Andy and Helena Hogarth became the new owners, and have helped the Manor to become well established as a hotel. Then in 2016, they refurbished the bedrooms, suites and public areas, at a cost of 2.5 million pounds, and it is now run as Hogarths Hotel and restaurant (holdings) Ltd.
And thankfully they have survived the recent pandemic.

OUR REVIEW
There is ample parking (photo 1) with 4 or 5 disabled bays (photo 2) available.
The entrance 
to the hotel is very appealing, with its olde worlde charm (3)
and we entered a very nice reception area, in dark wooden deco (4). with an elegant staircase with wide steps (5).
Immediately we entered and found it a delight to sit in the small comfortable lounge with a lovely warm log fire (photo 6). The bar next door is in a larger room, beautifully decorated, (7) (unfortunately the photo does not do it justice) as there were so many people enjoying the room, so it was difficult to take photos.
There is a small corridor to take you to disabled room (8) which has a spacious disabled toilet, grab rails and pull cord, spotlessly clean.(9)



Outside, we found a delightful garden area, (10) with views of the elegant restaurant, delightful decor, and so inviting (photo 11).  
The rear door for the functions room had a very nice terraced area (12) with more tables on a grassy area, belonging to the functions room, an ideal setting for any special occasion and photos (photo 13).
Another terraced area for public use, in a lovely setting and would be most enjoyable on a warm sunny day (14). 
The front entrance to the functions room has that look that just draws you in (15) 
with a very pleasant reception area to meet up with your friends and family (16) before you sit in a beautiful restaurant for the function (17). Unfortunately there are steps, difficult, but it is level on the top deck, and from here you have a disabled toilet (18) again spacious and spotlessly clean (19).
On departing from this delightful hotel, we found a electric charging point (20) and bade farewell to our wonderful visit.

OUR FINAL THOUGHTS
A very inviting, warm, friendly wonderful hotel, and we highly recommend this hotel, even with its little problem of steps here and there."
1386,"Helped another wheelchair user by getting the ramp and pushed her up it.  Offered to help me.
Moved chairs so I could get in though didn't consider I might want to transfer.  But overall very helpful."
1387,Friendly and willing to help though I didn't need help.
1388,Staff very friendly and willing to assist people if required.
1389,Flat access into the hotel and to the pool area.  Lift access to all floors - need your room key to operate lifts.
1390,We didn’t use any public toilets so I cannot comment on them.
1391,The staff were very helpful and welcoming.
1392,"Top marks go to Murrayfield. There was more than one accessible loo and those I used were fine with ample space, spotlessly clean and everything I needed. Since my visit, and on a subsequent visit, I found Murrayfield had installed a Changing Places Toilet - in a word excellent!"
1393,"Staff were very apologetic at Spa about loo not being available, but as we had doubled checked twice if facilities would be suitable this was obviously not high on the agenda, as why would somebody in a wheelchair need the loo.  Main spa has no disabled changing facilities which meant I could not have used pool or have a shower after.  "
1394,"Lovely accessible restaurant on Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow. Good menu with something for everyone. Great service and very friendly atmosphere - well, it is Glasgow! 
The accessible toilet is handy but there wasn't a reachable red cord when I was there."
1395,"Access is good as mentioned before.

A ramp could be more practical than the complicated electric lift.
"
1396,Lovely garden centre that is easily accessible all over. Some side aisle may be a little on the tight side but the majority of the garden centre has plenty of room. There is an upstairs and this can be accessed by a lift. The food is very yummy and the wait isn't long at all and the restaurant is very roomy. 
1397,"A lovely Autumn walk around Doune ponds, through the woods. A couple of good viewing platforms above the water and accessible bird hides. Paths were fine even when covered in wet leaves and all mostly flat. Accessible parking was close by."
1398,"Public transport is excellent around here. Waverley Train Station is just across the road, as are numerous taxi ranks, bus stops and tram stops."
1399,"We got the train into Dundee station, and the Unicorn was a 5-10 minute push from there. Easier for the members in the group with powerchairs than for those in manual chairs, but still very manageable as the surfaces were flat. I didn't notice on-street parking nearby, but the Quay is a 2 minute push across the bridge, with parking available there."
1400,"Low thresholds and wide doorways, plenty of space to get around. There is a double and twin and bathroom downstairs plus two further bedrooms and a bathroom and toilet upstairs. The double room can also be configured as a twin. We had it as a double and there was plenty of space to access it from either side. A commode/shower chair can be borrowed if required. There is more information about accessibility features on the owners' website."
1401,Mrs Crosby is the best teacher ever! And Elaine/ mr odonnel help anyone with needs.
1402,"Good signage. Permanent loops are on the counter. There are four and they were all working. They have one portable loop which was also working. Staff all aware of loop requirements on counters. Portable loops available for ""one on one"" interviews."
1403,"We were approached to enter through the front door of the castle once inside, doors opened ropes parted in what was an extra special trip. Staff could not have been more helpful.
We could access two levels of the castle with the assistance of a small enteral lift. The upper level of the castle could be watched on a short video which was really good and worth watching for the information alone."
1404,When entering the museum in the car there is a hut where you make payments for all of your entries. The staff at this hut are very friendly and helpful and point you in the right direction of parking. There are disables parking bays located at the very front of the car park. 
1405,It was without doubt the friendliness and helpful tips and suggestions that made out visit. It is for this reason we decided to give the castle the rating we did. We were made to feel welcome and our experience of visiting made us want to come back again! and we will !!
1406,"I still think of the Hall extension as new but it has been open a while.  It is marvellous though as are the accoustics which make this a lovely venue.   Once seats are found, an enjoyable evening can be had."
1407,Wheelchair accessible. More clear signposting to the accessible door and the pothole filled in would be helpful.
1408,"Flat access into the restaurant, it’s not very big but was easy enough for me in my electric wheelchair."
1409,"It has been many years since we have stayed at this hotel and have to say it met most of our requirements. I do not know what kind of glazing the room had but it certainly shut out any road noise.  With dual aspect windows, one also could look down to Ocean Terminal and across the dock area.  
The bed was large and comfortable, although the duvet cover hardly me the sides of the bed when we were in it. 
We found Breakfast as expected from previous stays in other Holiday Expresses, with a good choice from either scrambled eggs, sausages and  baked beans or continental breakfast option if one preferred. Unfortunately we never found the cereals but again, we ought to have asked."
1410,"We had a really good experience with them, from when I got in touch beforehand with some questions about the access, right through to the end of our stay. They happily agreed to put a child's bed into one of their accessible rooms so I, my partner and our young son could all stay together, and they were unfazed by finding a place for my hired scooter to stay on charge."
1411,"There is no wheelchair access to the Hall, but there is a lift which can take a manual wheelchair down into the tea-room.
There is a wide path from the main car park to and around the Hall but it is quite steep. The rolling parkland does not have any made paths, and has animals grazing, which makes the walking challenging in places. The kitchen garden is accessible by wheelchair, if you go onto the grass to avoid the small step on the path.  
There is one powered and two manual wheelchairs available for free hire at the reception area. 
The hall has 12 shallow steps into the main house, the ground floor is then accessible. However the upper and lower levels are only accessible by further flights of stairs, some of which are narrow and steep.   "
1412,"There is no parking at the hotel there is a car par across the road that has Blue badge spaces however there is restrictions in place 3 hour time limit. 
There is a bus stop across the road used by local buses, This is also a one way street"
1413,My local cinema which I visit a lot.
1414,Bus stops a few hundred yards away. Taxis also. No parking that I know of.
1415,This hotel is between the Central and South Pier in Blackpool it has 3 levels of decking in the front of it that allow you to sit and enjoy a drink etc. in good weather. There is a ramp to one side of the decking area that gives you access to all 3 levels including the entrance to the hotel. Inside in the bar has lots of light and has a number of large screens showing News etc. If you are staying in the hotel you need to use your key card outside public areas such as the bar.
1416,We visited the bar and it was great! Level access in from the street. Combination of different seating options so these can be rearranged as needed. There were dog bowls right at the door. Outside there are 'fire pits' that will be brilliant in summer but look a bit tricker to access if you are a wheelchair user due to the concrete structures but all the 'gates' are open that won't be an issue...
1417,My husband is still able to go to a loo himself so found it relatively easy to find a loo.
1418,"There is an accessible toilet in the grounds, about five minutes walk/wheel from the Schloss."
1419,"Plenty of signage in the foyer for the coffee shop, box office, cloakrooms and lift.

Lift to all levels, but only the stalls seating area on level 1 is wheelchair accessible.

Plenty of accessible toilets. Levels 1 and 2."
1420,There is a quite a high metal threshold (1/1.5 inches) to get over to get in the front door. 
1421,"Good signs and directions. Ramp into the house,wide doors/corridors. Large lift to all floors,no steps. Plenty of manoeuvre room in the galleries. Outside paths wheelchair suitable "
1422,There are several accessible toilets on the ground floor with plenty of room to manoeuvre.
1423,We parked a little way away from Valerie’s as we wanted to enjoy the walk along the spotlessly clean prom so wasn’t aware of nearby parking.  There is no parking immediately next to Valerie’s .
1424,large toilet
1425,Z Arts is on a bus route. Its on a busy main road. There are disabled parking bays at the front of the building.
1426,Large supermarket car park adjacent.  Could only see 1 disabled space directly opposite restaurant door.  Not sure about public transport in the area.
1427,Fully accessible with plenty space to manoeuvre a wheelchair around.
1428,"Peterborough Station provides full step-free access and extremely friendly assistance, there are modern (2013) lifts to all platforms. The station is about 10 minutes walk/roll from the Cathedral. Be careful - the route is very badly signposted and you may get temporarily very lost."
1429,"Large disabled toilet, clean and spacious"
1430,Martin was very helpful even when we shut ourselves out one night! There was no resident staff and no need for it anyway
1431,"Good flat, tarmac path with just one slope at the end if you do the full circle back to the car park."
1432,"Not easy to get from Glasgow City Centre by Car. Public transport is unreliable.
"
1433,The toilets are situated in a very central position although there is only one
1434,As the venue compromises of upstairs rooms and the building has no lift it is very difficult to access for people with physical impairments. 
1435,"Staff at the restaurant we stopped at were very friendly, and it's all table service. The staff at the checkout also seemed polite, and they clearly take customer service seriously with a 'rate your experience' voting machine by the exit."
1436,"Disabled toilets everywhere,  mostly a little small for turning  but nice and clean"
1437,"The recent make-over of Abbotsford House has made the two walled gardens and almost the whole of the public parts of the house fully wheelchair accessible, and includes a fully accessible modern visitor centre with restaurant, shop and exhibition. Only the chapel and the parkland between the house and the Tweed are not wheelchair accessible."
1438,A large and very well maintained accessible loo with plenty of room for a wheelchair and a carer if necessary.
1439,"Firstly, it's only £4 to see a film.  
Secondly - the seats recline and are incredibly comfy
Thirdly - the sound is superb

And best of all, the cinemas are entered from the back, so the wheelchair spaces are in the back row meaning you aren't bending your neck looking up at the screen.

There are a few steps leading into the venue, but there's a bell to ring for wheelchair access and they'll open the fire door to lead to the ramp. Lift to all floors, and accessible toilets too.

Genuinely a pleasure to use simply for the novelty of sitting at the back! The only other I can think of in Cardiff is at Chapter."
1440,"The cottage itself was spacious and had the most exquisite outdoor area. Which we we lucky enough to use a lot. 
Also the locals were super welcoming too for wheelchair access. "
1441,All that I came across were helpful and friendly especially our waitress BEV.
1442,"There were accessible toilets off the dining area and off the reception. These were bright, light and spacious."
1443,There is a accessible toilet in the Market Hall that's next door to the conventional loos. It's tucked away so it's best to go into the middle of the hall and look back toward the market and you will see it on the right. It's a long and narrow layout so for some wheelchair users it may well mean wheeling in and reversing out. It's well provisioned and modern and clean.
1444,"Old theatres are a challenge in terms of access. The theatre allocates an Access Host to assist. There are steps into the venue from pavement to lobby, then from lobby to dress circle - two wheelchair lifts give access in theory. Regrettably, they've seen better days and the former was broken when I first tried to book then amazingly on the day I visited!"
1445,We only saw the two owners Mark and Elizabeth who could not do too much to make you holiday 1st class
1446,level access into all units.  Most shops easily accessible although some overcrowding with clothes racks in some.
1447,"The ticket office is stilted on a large pond and there is level access into the spacious room. Once inside, you are given a map with clear directions around the park. The map makes it look very spread out, but it's actually very compact. Also, the map gives the impression that there are stairs up to the tree top trail - this isn't the case it is step-free with an incline (not too steep). The park has two cafes (one indoor and one outdoor) which are both accessible. There are accessible toilets at each of these cafes. Many of the activities are designed for children, and family members can watch from seating points all around the park as kids climb robes and try tree top obstacle courses. There are view points from every angle so you won't miss any of the action. The Labyrinth is a boardwalk maze which is level access apart from the tree house in the centre. It's unfortunate because the tree house is the centre of the maze, but it most of the exciting bits are in the lead up to it! It's very multi-sensory, with speakers creating atmospheric noises, lots of things to look at and things to feel. 
The Wonderland area of the park is a little sparse but still a nice place to wander around with some optical illusions thrown in the mix. If the weather is particularly bad, you could explore the Bamboozleum which is all indoors and is full of buttons to press, optical illusions and exciting things to look at. This is joined onto the gift shop which is all level access, if a little bit on the small side.
I highly recommend the treetop trail - it is a one-way route through some beautiful Cairngorm trees with wildlife clues and information boards around the trail. There is a spectacular tree with a lightning scar that you can get right up close to. "
1448,The disabled parking was right outside the  cabin and there was plenty of room for two cars.
1449,"There are no steps throughout the whole park, all the ground was even and if you needed any help at any point you know there is plenty of staff around."
1450,"The loo is in the large wet room, with plenty of grab rails in a contrasting colour for those who might need that. There was plenty of room for a carer/ wheelchair and a shower chair is available although there is a fold down shower seat. The sink ( like the dressing table in the bedroom and the sink/worktop in the kitchen) is adjustable. The place was spotless with plenty of towels, loo paper and soap. The toilet even washed and dried you!! "
1451,"As mentioned, the People park at top of the pedestrian slope preventing chair access so they can wheel their sports equipment down. Lift to 1st floor function room, viewing area at ground floor is quite limited and often not available as it’s a shared space so used by siblings or parents watching their kids play/ train "
1452,Superb facilities
1453,There is car parking next door to the hotel - didn't see any specific blue badge spaces. You can drop off right outside the door of the hotel - you can also drop off right outside the accessible cottage.
1454,Staff are helpful & knowledgeable. Happy to help loading your car. Also offer home delivery.
1455,Really good! From the step free entrance to the decent sized lifts (there's different lifts for different parts of the auditorium). There was also clear signage regarding the Hearing Loop.
1456,"We visited two toilets. The first one was inside an exhibit, but for some reason had a ridiculously steep slope leading up to it. I doubt anyone in a wheelchair could make it alone, and with no handrail my husband needed my assistance to get to them safely. The actual toilet was dark and cramped."
1457,"The easiest way to get from/ to the airport is to use the tram. The tram is step free and has wheelchair spaces. There are two lines that go to the airport. Most tourist will use tram line 2 that goes from the airport to Port Lympia, as that line goes through Nice city centre. The other tram line 3 goes to Saint Isidore. Tickets need to be purchased, from a machine, before boarding the tram and validated in a machine once you get on it. The trams are very regular."
1458,The wet room in my room was great with plenty of space and everything I needed. There was an accessible loo by the bar and restaurant which was fine.
1459,"Two disabled bays reasonable close to main entrance, which had a small step over curb and by door, but easily managed. Once inside hotel, everything on ground floor level was nice and flat, space to get wheelchair around comfortably, with room in bar area and restaurant for chair.
The disabled bedroon is down on the lower floor, with a 
wheelchair lift right by reception desk, then a pull door to get you into corridor to reach your room.
The lovely terrace area has a ramp for you to go and enjoy the sunny warm day, with views over the well looked after grounds, but no ramp to get you down to enjoy the walk across to pool and woodland area."
1460,"There are several accessible loos in the building. The first I tried was adjacent to  the ladies loos and was Ok although the presence of bins did make it tricky to manoeuvre.

Another, found later was through a door and on a landing overlooking the stairs. This was a much better and bigger loo. A wide easy to open door gives access, space to turn and manoeuvre."
1461,Parking is available across the road a couple of disable spaces.  A short walk over to the entrance which is down a hill and a bit uneven.
1462,We asked the staff at the museum who kindly told us the most accessible way to get to Fort Charlotte which was up 2 steep slopes and then across a road into the Fort.  
1463,The staff was very friendly and helpful. 
1464,"Ramps were in place to access the rooms and then the access to the hall, bar   Restaurant and bistro was all on the level."
1465,Level access but two doors to negotiate. One on a bend. Would need assistance.
1466,Friendly and polite.
1467,Semi decent wheelchair access. 
1468,"The Drummochy lodge is spacious, bright, comfortable and has a brilliant wet room. Lowered surfaces in the kitchen allowed my husband to feel involved in helping prepare meals. "
1469,"There is some outdoor seating and an indoor glass conversatory area, see photo, which are both step free. There is a step or two into the main area of the restauant. In the main part of the restaurant there are some long tables. There are also smaller tables and all have free standing chairs. Counter where you pay is at standing height."
1470,"Massive car park if the one at the back and plenty of spaces, for the disabled and the main stream"
1471,"A lovely hotel with good disabled access, level and spacious with good sized lifts. I found the doors to the room a bit on the heavy side to open. 
My room turned out not to be an accessible one, but I managed with the wheelchair. This was due to me travelling with a team and other players got the wheelchair rooms and said they were great. Good amount of grab rails and wet room shower. I apologise in advance as I never got photos of the accessible rooms, I only took photos of my room."
1472,"Excellent staff, good food, silver service."
1473,Level parking for two cars immediately adjacent to entrance.
1474,In reception there was a basic accessible loo with grab rails (grey) around the toilet and sink. There was also a changing places toilet. There were also other basic accessible loos available as you went around the studio.  There was also toilets in the car park near the bus stops.
1475,Step free access from street to entrance and there is a staircase with rails both sides and a lift to every floor. At ground level there is a self service café and some table and chairs. On the 1st floor is a bar (not open when we visited for the matinee) and tables and chairs.  The tables and chairs are an eclectic assortment of high and low tables and sofas and comfy chairs. Some of the seats are without arms or quite low down so people who have difficulties transferring may find some of the seats unsuitable. 1st floor bar area has books dangling from the ceiling. There are 2 stages Park 200 (seats 200 people) and Park 90 (seats 90 people). We sat in Row D in the Stalls which was step free.  In the stalls there is a step down with no handrail to Stalls Row A. There is also a circle/ upper gallery.
1476,Although not actually at the cafe only a short distance passed reception desk is a fully accessible and large uncluttered disabled toilet
1477,There is a lift to every floor with plenty of room to manoeuvre.
1478,I am a regular for this tuesday thing is its the 2nd tuesday of the month and I support it
1479,only one toilet but was clean and had many ramps and much space.
1480,One area was roped off and we were trying to look at something at the edge of it so a member of staff removed the plastic chain and said there was no need for it to be closed off and opened it up.
1481,Good but shared with baby change facilities
1482,"Almost perfect! Ramped access to every function room and a platform lift to get to the restaurant. However, only blemish is the carpets were a little tough to push through."
1483,There is plenty of parking close to your lodge. The only criticism is that the surface this visit was a little difficult to manoeuvre a wheelchair on.
1484,Toilets are fine but a bit of a beer barrel obstacle course on the way.  Disabled toilet used for storage of baby equipment so a struggle to actually get in to use it!  Otherwise adequate.
1485,The staff are very friendly and helpful.
1486,"It's possible for a wheelchair user to have an agreeable time at this café, even though it's cramped and has no accessible toilet."
1487,"All of the tram stops are very clearly marked out and are of a platform type like a station there is a ramp at both ends of each platform for access. Every platform has two wheelchair sign marked on them so when the tram stops you are at a suitable access door. 
Each tram can take 2 wheelchairs in the wheelchair space however at busy periods they can take more by using the doors opposite the direction of travel. So this can mean up to 6 wheelchairs being on board. There is also an emergency bell in each of the 2 main wheelchair spaces."
1488,A faultless experience! 
1489,Always happy to help when we go
1490,Level access disabled toilet.
1491,"Easy, flat access throughout. You can park right outside the door which makes things so easy. "
1492,"There is an induction loop, used for services. Most hymn words and responses are on the large projector screen. Large print can be provided if you request in advance."
1493,There is an accessible loo and Changing Places Toilet adjacent to the shop on the station concourse.
1494,Come by car. That way  you will find a disabled spot much easier to park in. 
1495,Not specifically an accessible toilet but the toilets are all on one level and spacious. 
1496,Staff were all very helpful.
1497,There's a step up to the door.
1498,Friendly 
1499,Pretty good! For this visit we were in hospitality so they were a lot warmer than usual!
1500,Level 3 has one disabled toilet inside the main toilets and it is difficult to access.  There is one on level 2 which is easy to access but a nuisance if you have to go down in the lift to use it and back up to the auditorium.
1501,Disabled toilets are very good
1502,on a street so could get a car/to the door. Parking possibly a bit of a problem
1503,"See above. This is a tarmac path with a smooth surface and easy gradients.  From Craigleith Retail Park to Crewe Road North is 0.75 miles.  There are wheelchair accessible ways off the path on both sides of Crewe Road, with nearby bus stops. We explored the next section (the Ferry Road path). There are accessible ways off the path at Boswall Place (0.5 miles from Crewe Road North) and at Wardie Road (0.96 miles from Crewe Road North) and convenient bus stops on Ferry Road."
1504,"Transport & Parking
There is a council car park right outside of Dundee Science Centre which is free for blue badge holders but other visitors  have to do pay and display, I could see about 3 or 4 disabled parking spaces. Across the road there is also Greenmarket car park which is also a council car park but is indoors and I think there are lots of parking spaces.

Dundee Science Centre is located in the city centre of Dundee so there is lots of public transport nearby. The train station is a 5 minute walk away, maybe not even that long, and there is a taxi rank here. The bus station is about a 10 minute walk away and there are also bus stops nearby which go all over the Dundee and Angus area."
1505,"Talkin Tarn is a very attractive local lake surrounded by woods. The track was absolutely fine for my scooter so we enjoyed the views, the woods, the waterfowl and the fresh air. There is a café and giftshop and a brilliant kids' play area.
The weather was very cold so we didn’t explore as much as we might, but if you are in the area and want some fresh air, this is a lovely place to visit.
There is ample parking which is free for Blue Badge holders for up to 3 hours if you display the time that you arrived. From the car park to the lake is quite a slope but you can park behind the café shop where there are some marked bays and access from there is much less steep. There are toilets, including an accessible one requiring a RADAR-key. 
"
1506,"Helensburgh Central Train Station is located within the town, next to the shops etc and is only two streets along from Colquhoun Square.  Trains link directly to both Glasgow and Edinburgh.

There are local buses.

The nearest car park is the pier car park - there are marked disabled bays at the top of the car park (near where the swimming pool is). 
If you don't have a blue badge, it is worth knowing that you have to pay for standard parking in the top half of the car park...but parking is free if you go to the bottom of the carpark!

There is also street parking, with some marked disabled bays. Most streets have time limits of how long you can be parked there."
1507,Summerhall has recently been busy working on some new developments to increase access for everyone. It's now possible to enjoy even more of the curious places and spaces!
1508,"Wide electric doors, shop immediately to the left. Lots of maritime themed items that were easy to see. Clear floors, manoeuvrable space, low tills to pay."
1509,"There is a lift, ramps, including into interactive areas and displays. There are foldable seats you can borrow too."
1510,"As part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival celebrations, I went to see a role-playing game show, 'Adventurers wanted', at Sweet Holyrood, located in the Macdonald Holyrood Hotel.  Staff could not have been more knowledgeable or helpful regarding my additional access requirements, and access itself was simple with step-free facilities and brilliant signage to toilets and lifts."
1511,The venue had disabled parking closest to the café as well as directly next to the maze entrance. The disabled facilities were clearly marked and staff were dotted around to help out if needed.
1512,"We were on the adjacent CMC site. Nicky, the manager was so friendly and accommodating that we went there for breakfast every day.
Jasper, our whippet enjoyed a biscuit or two each visit. The nearby Cumberland Trail was well designed, wending through Woodland. Trees were labelled and there was a bird hide ."
1513,"A fun Fringe outing with a large group of people to see theatre and acrobatics. Venue staff were super helpful, and the view from the wheelchair accessible seating was great."
1514,"Signage was big and clear, Wheelchair friendly and also dementia friendly facility , great"
1515,"Easy access on ground floor but to get to counter you have to claim about 6 steps on 2 levels, seats a wee bit tight so no real place to put a wheelchair."
1516,"The toilets ranged from a shed with a 'drop-toilet' which are not easy for females particularly and even harder when you struggle to 'squat' to the toilet tents erected by Ahsante. These are portaloos and do flush and you can sit, (luxury) with a sigh of relief. I struggled with the pull flush lever as my stumps were too chunky but a nice porter was always looking out for me to do it for me (lid down , no nasty job really!)"
1517,Accessible loo at Tiverton canal car park.
1518,"Parking was payable even for disabled customers, which I find unacceptable as public transportation links to this hotel are not great for mobility impaired transport users."
1519,Only a drop of area but lits of buses and taxis close by. Obviously lots of trains!
1520,"The Millennium Gallery always has a good selection of exhibitions and events, as well as a nice cafe and shop. It is all wheelchair accessible. There is a disabled toilet and both entrances to the buildings have level and ramped access."
1521,they always put wheelchair users at the front
1522,"Toilets are located on the right hand side of the store as you enter the store there is no signage for the toilets
You go through a door from the store area to the toilets this opens outwards.
The accessible toilet is located to the right as you enter this area it is a good basic accessible toilet with grip rails on both sides. However the cover is missing from the toilet paper holder so if you do go to use paper it rolls and ends up on the floor."
1523,The accessible toilets are a lift journey away couple with fighting through the crowd of people in the hallway. One toilet is quite petite but the other has more space .
1524,"There was a toilet, although it was not sign posted very well. It was rather on the small size so I am sure manoeuvring within it would be very difficult for both the user and carer. The toilet was not clean and lacked basic sanitary products, such as a working Hand dryer and clean soap. The locks on the door were broken. However, there were grab rails and an emergency lever."
1525,"This branch of Caffè Nero is just yards from the Shepherd's Bush Overground station, which is step-free and has wheelchair ramps. The tube station is not step-free, despite being very new, which is a puzzle. Zillions of buses come and go, as you would expect, at this bus station. So overall this location is well served by accessible transport."
1526,"The café is located in the town centre on a pedestrianised street. Outside there was a free standing table with two chairs. There is level access inside from street level. At the front is the chip shop with a high counter. After the counter is a step or two down without a hand rail. The café has free standing table and chairs with narrow aisles in between, so it is feels quite compact when it is busy.  "
1527,"Good access to toilet and the lifts have plenty room for a wheelchair along with several other people. 
Student union is very user friendly however doors and the odd step can prove tricky, due to how heavy the fire doors are, resulting in a quick shutting. Often doors only open one way.
The train station especially was quite tricky due to a very long wheelchair access ramp. 
Library is accessible with an easy rolling carpet however books are often out of reach with thin corridors."
1528,This pub is almost fully wheelchair-accessible. Only a few raised podium areas in the front bar cannot be reached by a wheelchair.
1529,nearest parking is available at john lewis or buchanan galleries. the nearest bus station is the buchanan bus station
1530,Went by car there is a lots of spaces as it is a very very big carpark.
1531,Staff were friendly and willing to help anytime.
1532,Car park with 3 disabled spaces.  Cant comment on public transport 
1533,No real interaction.
1534,"I only saw one - which I used, it is by the front door and very accessible.  A decent size and well appointed."
1535,"Not so sure about parking in this area, nearest is probably Chamber Street or on street parking near Bristo Place. Great for Lothian Buses however, there is a bus stop right outside. "
1536,"The owners Tina and Chris have only recently bought Boundary Farm and refurbished the cottages for their first guests at Easter 2017.   They are keen to encourage wheelchair users, they responded very quickly to the few queries we had and thanked us for our suggestions.   If you have questions about the suitability of the accommodation for you, I would encourage you to ring and speak to them.    "
1537,"Lively university union bar with relatively cheap drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) as well as a range of hot and cold food. 
Staff are friendly and willing to help. There is also a large outside terrace area which is lovely when it's sunny, with wheelchair access outside. "
1538,"The facilities are excellent in the disabled changing room/bathroom - height adjustable adult size changing bench, roll in shower with large wall mounted shower seat, ceiling hoist, and a raised toilet with rails on both sides, though there is only space on the right side of the toilet for a lateral transfer as the toilet is in the corner. There is also a wheeled shower chair available. 

However, this facility is the only disabled toilet available poolside which is a massive oversight. It means that if someone else is changing, which can take a while even for those without disabilities, there is no access to a disabled toilet unless you go back upstairs which is far from ideal as the lift is very close to the front door so it is very cold if you are only in swimwear!  There should be a another disabled toilet available, not just the one in the changing room which is why I marked this down despite the available facilities being good, there just isn’t enough! I ended up having to wait a long time to get access to the toilet but still ended up having to go upstairs as I couldn’t wait any longer. "
1539,"Tropical World is a really fun and interesting place to visit, I chose to go because it's level access because my friend is in a wheelchair. Make a day of it and go to Roundhay Park and do what we did and get some scrumptious food at the Roundhay Fox, also level access (you may need to book ahead there are popular!). There is also a cafe at Tropical World and I noticed a man in a power chair in there."
1540,It's right on the lochside so no public transport.  Carpark is rough gravel with one disabled space outside the door.
1541,We have been visiting Tillybods for some time now. A wide variety of hot drinks are available and sandwiches are made fresh to order. Gluten free and dairy free options are available. A new wheelchair ramp has been provided meaning wheelchair users can now enter the establishment. 
1542,"The Art Workers' Guild is a body of highly skilled artists, craftspeople and architects. It's based in a historic townhouse in one of the beautiful Bloomsbury squares. It is open to the public for special events. I attended a Bloomsbury Jamboree, a day focusing on art and history, with ticketed talks, book signings and exhibitors. The building is beautifully decorated and well worth visiting to see the venue alone. 

The Art Workers' Guild have made their historic townhouse step free and accessible on the ground floor. The upper floor accessible only by stairs and is going to be a challenge to most people with mobility impairments."
1543,"The staff are all lovely. There’s no elitism, no cliqueyness. Even if you’ve never climbed before you will feel welcome and supported. "
1544,"Friendly pub with music.
There are casual music sessions on Saturday & Sundays 3pm to 6pm and bands in the evening."
1545,"There is an accessible toilet, the door is unlocked with a RADAR key. If you don't have a RADAR key, the bar staff have one. There were two great annoyances with this toilet. (1) The red emergency cord had been tied up in a complex way around a raised grabrail (see my photo). This is very silly and thoughtless. The red emergency cord must hang freely all the way to the floor at all times so that it can be reached by anyone who falls over in the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet & back. (2) There was an ENORMOUS bin in the way so there wasn't room to turn: VERY annoying."
1546,staff kept us advised when a table would become available. they also moved a chair for me. service was friendly and attentive.
1547,"There are several accessible toilet and in 2020, the museum installed a changing places toilet. There are wheelchair symbols for the accessible toilets but there is no signage for the changing places toilet apart from on its door. The changing places toilet is next to the men's toilet on level 0. A radar key is needed to open the door. On the day I visited the staff did not know where the radar key was. There is an accessible toilet, sink, bench, hoist, free standing screen, grab rails. The emergency cord hangs loose but does not reach the floor. There instructions for the hoist were on a laminated card sitting on top of one of the bins. It would be more helpful if this was on a wall in large print.

THERE WAS NO SOAP OR EVEN A SOAP DISPENSER. 

This made me feel very upset. We are in the middle of a pandemic and there has been so much emphasis on hands, face, space. It appears not to apply for disabled visitors at the IWM. On exiting the changing places door didn’t lock behind me. I had to use my key to secure it. 

The IWM London’s press statement when the changing places toilet was opened it quotes Laura Crean, Assistant Director, Strategy and Governance, said: “We are delighted to be opening a brand new Changing Places toilet at IWM London. This new facility will ensure that we have adequate, clean and safe facilities for all of IWM London’s visitors and will therefore substantially improve the visitor experience to our museum. IWM is committed to removing and reducing barriers to make IWM open to everyone, whether those barriers are cultural, social, attitudinal, physical or educational. Installing a Changing Places toilet at IWM London is one step forward to reducing those barriers.” 

Having a changing places toilet is not enough in itself. On the day I visited unless a disabled person had their own radar key they would not have been able to get in and use the facility. There is no point having a changing places toilet, if staff don't have access to a radar key and disabled people are prevented from gaining admission. It then just becomes lip service, a box ticket, but without any genuine commitment to ensuring our dignity, independence or safety. 

Organisations need to advertise their changing places toilets, they are a real asset, it will bring in more visitors, clear signage will make it easier for disabled people to locate it, staff need accessibility training and be able to locate radar key(s) promptly so disabled people can quickly assess toileting facilities safely that meet their access needs. Going to the effort of installing a changing places toilet, and no one thinking of including a soap dispenser, shows a lack of thought, and now given the hands, face, space messages of covid is negligent.

I’ve checked the changing place’s website map and the IWM London’s toilet does not feature on the map, which raises the question whether or not it has been registered and details submitted. "
1548,The staff were incredibly polite
1549,Absolutely brilliant!!!!
1550,"The ramp to the front door was good, with automatic doors in the main part of the building. The lift was pretty poor, very small and being used by everyone in the hotel so we had long waits. It didn't reach as far as the leisure complex and there was no other disabled access to the pool and gym. We weren't able to have a swim."
1551,Plenty of accessible toilets. One on every floor. There is a lift but it isn't huge.
1552,"All the staff and volunteers that I encountered during my visit were very friendly and knew about the accessibility of the trail. There was just one time that a volunteer didn’t tell us about an alternative pathway up to some of the lights instead of the bark, but we found it.

I would say one thing that did annoy me was the volunteers kept asking me if I needed to use the Changing Places toilet. I understand that they were probably asked to make people aware of this great feature however, I felt it wasn’t very discreet."
1553,"An accessible Leisure center with disabled parking bays close by at the rear of the building within easy reach of the ramped access to the main entrance, dropped counters at the reception where friendly staff are always on hand to assist if needed.
a selection of large, fully accessible toilets, changing rooms and shower rooms with alarm cords are available and easy to find.
Once in the building it is level access to the changing rooms and swimming areas, there is a lift to access the gym and fitness suites."
1554,"The Edwardian cafe staff were mostly very helpful, as were the museum staff when I asked for directions to the disabled loo. The man who answered the telephone when I rang the museum for information was very helpful indeed."
1555,"On the ground floor there was an accessible toilet which was identifiable with a sign on its door. The toilet was spacious and clean, with grab rails and an emergency cord."
1556,"Generally good access, unless you have a ‘service’ dog’, then most things are off limits.

Signage and the ‘assistance dog’ paper map are inaccurate and confusing. "
1557,"I have not needed mobility help on my visit, but the staff was very friendly and approachable."
1558,"Very friendly and helpful. My wife prefers to transfer, and this was fine. The staff are very knowledgeable about the food, and enthusiastic."
1559,"Adapted toilets to varying degrees at Kidderminster, on adapted carriages and most other stations. You would have to be brave to use the loo on a rocking steam locomotive! See photo."
1560,"There is accessible toilets. These are spacious with grab rails and emergency cords. I think there are accessible toilets on all floors, but I only used the one by the Cromwell Road entrance."
1561,Level access throughout with space to get access into most of the stalls.
1562,"Visited earlier this year with my scooter. The staff couldn't have been more helpful..From going through the front door to the guy on the observation deck who was a mine information which was all correct.
I've been visiting Portsmouth since childhood,so probably knew more about the area than he did. But he was good.
The views are spectacular,he whole city is below you,Southampton Water in the distance and the whole length of the Isle of Wight.
Well worth a visit on a quieter day,not so sure if it was mega busy."
1563,"Wide clear, level, entrance.  Roomy interior for easy access."
1564,Staff were friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.
1565,There is one step at the front of the business. We have requested a ramp and this is now kept in storage by the front door. The owners are very friendly and will get the ramp out for you. The coffee shop is small but there is enough room to manoeuvre in a reasonably big wheelchair. 
1566,"Accessible, easy to find. Clean"
1567,"There was a wet room on the ground level with a toilet and there was a separate toilet on this level too. The wet room was very spacious for me to drive around it in my wheelchair. I had to wash my hair in my wheelchair because the it was so warm (don’t worry covered electronics and was totally safe) and there was plenty of room for me and my helper. 

A showerchair was provided for me but, it was a little too big for me to sit in and there was a fold down showerchair attached to the wall. There was a a self cleaning function on the toilet in the wet room but, I didn’t use them. The toilet is positioned in the centre of the wall in the wet room. There is a tracking hoist within the wet room which is separate from the tracking hoist in the bedroom so, you would need to transfer into a chair in the bedroom to then transfer again.

The toilet on the ground level is just the standard size of an accessible toilet. The toilet is closer to the left hand side of the room so, it would be easier for people to transfer at the right hand side.

I do not need the use of an emergency red cord myself because I always need assistance from someone however, I do know about the need for them. The only issue I would say about the toilets at Homelands is that there were no red cords. I don’t know if it’s to make them look more homely and I don’t 100% know if it’s needed but, I’m assuming they are.

On the upper level of the house there was a bathroom. However, a wheelchair user can’t get up to it if they can’t climb stairs which I can’t so, I cannot comment on it."
1568,"The main doors are automatic which makes entry with a wheelchair very easy. There is a long, gentle carpeted ramp up to restaurant level. This is at the end of the reception area shown in my picture (the one with the tartan carpet). From this level there is another gentle ramp (hard surface) which goes down into the restaurant. I found it easy to push a chair on both.

The restaurant itself is very spacious. I think tables have been removed to allow for distancing."
1569,"Not all the entrances can be accessed in a wheelchair. There is one entrance that doesn't have lift access.

There were seats dotted around the mall. The lights were quite bright. There were 3 main lifts (one which was labelled as priority for wheelchairs) and then other lifts dotted about. I always find I am far away from the lifts. 

If you're mobility impaired I'd hire a wheelchair or scooter as the place is big and there is quite a lot of walking. "
1570,"Staff were friendly but a little too much. I was rushed into the lift and had to ask them to leave me to wander the area taking up the atmosphere. Similarly I was bundled to the front of the line to wait to go inside the wine bar area when I'd actually wanted coffee, then I just had to wait in line, which was awkward."
1571,"From the outside this bar doesn't appear accessible, however thanks to a lift and a disabled toilet, I was able to fully  enjoy this venue as a wheelchair user. "
1572,"Disabled toilet seemed spacious and tidy with enough room for the carer. There are 3 doors leading to the toilet (narrowest one being 80 cm/ 32"" wide)"
1573,"Fino is two minutes from Wakefield bus station, 10-15min walking distance from the station with the free bus as an option and the road has a bit of parking that is free with a blue badge. "
1574,Really helpful and friendly.
1575,"Paper: yes. Hot water: moderately hot. Baby changing facilities: yes, but for an able-bodied person standing up only."
1576,When the lift is in working order the venue is completely accessible.
1577,"Rynek Glowny is the largest medieval square in Europe and it is huge. The square was busy when I visited, on a Monday afternoon in June, and had lots of tourists but because of it large it was reasonably easy to avoid the crowds. The square itself is level and step free. There are large, flat cobblestones which were generally level, rather than protruding. I personally found it quite easy to walk around with my crutch in this area. However, I went on a hot, sunny day and I personally would not like to try to negotiate this large open space in the snow and ice. Also a couple of local people I was talking to, who had no obvious disabilities, said to me that the area is difficult to walk round in the rain.  

On the square are a few notable buildings. As I only went into 2 of them I will review them here.

Cloth Hall

In the middle of the square is the Cloth Hall. It's huge. There is step free access to the ground floor through open archways at either end. Inside there are stalls either side selling crafts and tourist souvenirs.  The stalls are at standing height. The building has nice architecture and features so it is well worth walking through even if you don't want to shop. the Cloth Hall is free to visit.

St Mary's Church

St Mary's Church, is one of the churches in the main square, and it is recognisable by its unmatching twin towers. On the hour, every hour, a trumpeter plays a short tune from the taller tower. I was in the square when this happened, I was not standing too close to the church and I struggled to hear the trumpeter, due to the general noise in the square and possibly the wind direction that day. I would therefore suggest trying to be near the church on the hour if you want to hear it. 

I went inside the church. There are 2 entrances to the church, one for people wanting to worship, and admission for them is free. However, they only have access to the back of the church as the front of the church is cordoned off. 

If you are facing the church's twin towers, walk round to the right. You will come into a courtyard. The visitors' entrance to the church is on the left. However before you go in you need to purchase a ticket. the ticket office is directly opposite the entrance, see photo. There is a single step to get inside and the counter is at standing height. When I visited tickets were 10 Poland złoty, about £2. The church has step free access with ramps at entrance and exit and step free elsewhere. There are fixed pews but if you make towards the front altar there are benches, without back support, which were easier for me to use.

"
1578,Level access to the room but I had to go through 2 doors to get the room so you would need somebody (at least one way
1579,All on one level with access to platforms..
1580,Disability-wise the only problem was the slope up to the restaurant but the food disappointed and there was a poor atmosphere.
1581,Friendly and helpful.
1582,"The museum is spread over several floors.

On the ground floor is the large shop, selling a wide variety of gifts and books. There is a single step into the shop, see photo. This is where you need to go when you arrive to buy your tickets, before joining the queue.

There are a lot of stairs with a single handrail. See photo.The stairs are quite steep but there is a half landing between each floor and on each floor you can stop and rest before you continue up the stairs. The stairs are quite narrow so people tend to wait rather than overtake you on the stairs.

On the first floor is Holmes and Watson's study/ living room. Like the rest of the house it is decorated in Victorian furnishings. There is a sofa which you can sit on, this is the only seating as you make your way round the museum. In the front room a member of staff in Victorian costume welcomes you and tells you a bit about the museum. In the back roomis Holmes' bedroom.

There are more stairs to the second floor. Here you will find Mrs Hudson's room in the front and Dr Watson's bedroom at the rear. The front room is more like a traditional museum with glass display cabinets.

Further stairs take you to the third floor. Here there are two rooms with waxwork models with scenes and characters from the stories.

There is also a very short flight of stairs with no rail to a toilet for exhibition purposes only. I didn't feel comfortable about using these stairs. See photo.

To exit the museum you retrace your steps down the stairs."
1583,Disabled loo down a corridor with difficult doors.
1584,"Staff were very kind, friendly and efficient. "
1585,This is run by volunteers and they were very helpful and welcoming. 
1586,"Full access to all areas, and every court has a hearing loop. Some of the lifts have the most magnificent doors I have ever seen on a lift, which is a nice bonus."
1587,"Best staff that I have ever dealt with, very helpful and well informed. "
1588,"We visited here for the new year,the lodge is owned by MNDA Scotland and can be booked through them.It is fitted to a very high standard and cannot be faulted in any way,everything you would need for the disabled is included in the price you pay and there is a discount for MND sufferers.It is situated on a quiet caravan park with an excellent restaurant on site."
1589,Helpful and friendly staff
1590,"Disabled parking at the front of the hotel and drop off parking too. Push button automatic door to the reception. The staff will come with a trolley and pick up your luggage from your car at the front of the hotel. If you arrive too early for check-in at 2pm and your room is not ready, your luggage will be stored to be delivered to your room later."
1591,"All of the main building (shop/cafe/toilets) is on one level throughout, with even flooring. The outside doors (leading to garden area) require you to push a button and then they open automatically.

In some areas, especially when busy, it can be a little tight to get round displays/the cafe if using a bigger wheelchair, however this is more than compensated for by the helpful staff, who will move things out of your way if necessary.

Immediately outside the main building is the garden centre area - this is also all paved and good to access. 
Some of the walks beyond this though - particularly the woodland walk, may not be accessible for everybody. These are in a more 'natural' state - in dry weather when the ground is more solid, some might manage it in their wheelchairs, but at other times it can be quite muddy."
1592,Very helpful
1593,"Staff get a well deserved top score. Very helpful, informative and nothing was too much trouble."
1594,Excellent access
1595,We didn’t have time to go into the farm or aquarium so this is based on the central area. We spent an afternoon and had a hot meal in the restaurant followed by a gentle meander around key areas. Paths are mostly smooth hard surfaces with the odd tree root bumps and similar.  Food was very good and it was a quiet afternoon with very few people - ideal for us. Viewing areas are mostly very good and information was also at a good height.
1596,Plenty of parking. 
1597,"What a great facility. Everything seemed to be level access with plenty of car parking space although not too many accessible parking spaces. The lounge/cafe area is totally accessible. There is also a good sized accessible toilet. Open to members and non members alike, People with disabilities can hire one of the amazing paragolfer off road wheelchairs to allow them to be able to play golf."
1598,On paper access to the restaurant was good and ticked on all the boxes. The live experience was different to the expectation that had been set.
1599,staff are always very helpful and will help carry heavy shopping to tills and then to vehicle if required. They will also help to carry over your food in restaurant is required. At the till the staff go out of their way to you!
1600,"Not entirely sure as we came on foot. 
There is parking behind quartermile in the streets nearby."
1601,There was an accessible loo inside Sammy's: clean with OK rails but a bit small for wheelchair manoeuvring.
1602,They were extremely helpful and friendly if I needed any help there was an number of helpers willing to help. 
1603,Staff were very helpful and welcoming.
1604,I went to see Snow Patrol at the Usher Hall recently and really enjoyed the gig. The wheelchair spots had a great view of the stage!
1605,"Wide aisles, plenty of room. Was quiet and calming."
1606,"Their is a disabled toilet within the bottem of the libary and their is one within the cafe at the top,"
1607,Easy access from main entrance to the disabled seating with ramped access with a  great view to the main arena.
1608,"Barters is at one end of Alnwick, which does have a train station and bus service.

It can be reached on foot, and has quite a steep sloped footpath up to it. This does have a handrail.

If coming by car, it has its own car-park on the same level as the entrance. It is not a large car-park and can be quite tight when it is busy. There are two disabled parking bays directly outside the front door.
Alternatively, there is some parking on the streets around it."
1609,"parking on the street, no nearby bus stops so only really accessible on foot."
1610,Don't go unless you have good neck muscles
1611,Smallish and not best location.  Folding doors are a bit off-putting
1612,"Wagamama restaurant is all entirely flat. The dor to enter from the outside entrance is heavy though, it’s not a power door. 

The biggest problem is access inside the restaurant is tight, all the tables are quite close together. Some areas are better than others for access, where we sat I had to squeeze through a very tight gap which required asking strangers to move their chairs slightly. It was definitely manageable for myself (my chair width is 48cm/18.9” excluding the wheels) but I wouldn’t call it good access. A different table may have helped though, I’d recommend sitting near the loos"
1613,"Basically, five star! Clean, red cords as they should be and a Changing Places. One thing I really liked was the accessible toilets weren't shared as baby changing, so no queues of riotous kids. Only thing I did find was one or two doors open outwards in to pretty crowded corridors, but a minor detail really!"
1614,The hotel has a small car park behind it.
1615,Not certain as have not used last two visits.
1616,"3 bedroom villa (2 en-suite). All bedrooms accessible with room for manual wheelchair. Accessible spacious lounge and kitchen. Let down is the bathrooms, doors are narrow. One en-suite bedroom accessible if you have mobility to manoeuvre manual wheelchair. Swimming pool and hot tub available. Able to use with assistance from others. Property all on ground level. "
1617,The restaurant entrance has level access but  the doors are heavy and so some assistance may be required. Inside is the reception. The bar and dining area (see photo) are downstairs and can be accessed from the reception via the stairs or by a lift. There are several tables. Not all the tables are easy to access if you are in a wheelchair. It is beneficial to inform the restaurant when booking that there will be a wheelchair user so that a suitable table is reserved.
1618,"Clean and functional, available on court level and also cafe level."
1619,We drove. Might be tricky by public transport. Large car park with disabled spaces
1620,Staff in the office are very friendly and helpful. Our online shopping order arrived before we did and it was unpacked and put in the fridge by Kim. 
1621,Toilets are a good size and always clean.
1622,Couldn’t be nicer.
1623,"Again, set up specifically for another individual, but a very high standard and quite adaptable."
1624,Taxi can drop off right outside on Bread Street. Bus stops on Lothian Road.
1625,The PRM team were very efficient when we arrived into Barcelona and met us at the Easyjet check in desk when we arrived at the airport for the return trip. Going through security can be very regimental but we had a great laugh with the man doing my security check. Overall any staff we had dealings with were very friendly and helpful.
1626,Fully accessible with well thought through lifts and a brilliant wheelchair viewing platform.
1627,There are bus stops close by and it is up the hill from Waverley station. It's on a slightly steep part of hill if your're arriving on foot.
1628,Two steps at front entrance negotiable by portable ramp but this is to be improved.  A disabled bedroom is having ramped access directly into room from car park.  There is room to navigate around the hotel by wheelchair.
1629,There was level access in to the house with fully widened doors throughout. There is an upstairs bedroom which I was told was beautiful with fantastic views but no lift to access. It was clear that this layout suited a mixed ability group of people living together with able bodied people using the upstairs bedroom and bathroom. It worked well for us.
1630,"The building gets five stars - it was the Hamburger Bahnhof, a mid 19th century railway station - one of the oldest in Germany. It became a transport museum and since 1996  has been the Museum für Legendary - Museum of Contemporary Art. How many stars the art (mostly post 1960) deserves is a matter of personal taste. We went to see an excellent temporary (until July 2016) exhibition about art in the Nazi era - both the art the regime approved of and the art it labeled as ""degenerate""."
1631,On street parking. Limited so arrive in good time.
1632,"Flat access via coffee shop attached to venue, tight access into lift which was full of food. Also lift is tight had to remove foot plates to fit in. Access in venue is great with wheelchair accessable tables"
1633,"Some of the paths are very muddy, the garden of contemplation especially but it's not impossible to use as a wheelchair user. The toilets are accessible and unlocked but the doors are very narrow and it was difficult to get in as a manual wheelchair user. It was very steep in places so I had to walk up them while pushing my chair or get a friend to push me. The food is alright and the staff are friendly."
1634,Great! There are two main entrances to the hotel - for level access you need to enter via the bar. The bar is a welcoming space and has a couple of different sections to it including an airy room with a balcony attached. To access the cottage you go out the bar entrance around the side of the hotel where there has been a new 'rubber' path put in. This on a gradient but is a new and well maintained path. The cottage has level access into a large spacious bedroom complete with large bathroom. You can get to the residents lounge too if you need level access via the side door. The one place where there is steps is to the restaurant - there are three steps. We managed to combat this with a long portable ramp - but it was still quite steep.
1635,"They won 'Loo of the Year' in the past so you cannot fault their toilets. Clean, accessible. However this next comment is for All Attractions, a Changing Places toilet would be THE best facility ever as it opens up a world of opportunities to 250,000 people who cannot stand and use a standard accessible toilet . They need hoisting so without a CP outings are SEVERELY limited. Special schools,nursing homes day care, groups etc always have to choose somewhere with changing and hoist facility"
1636,"My wife could get around with her zimmer no problem.

"
1637,I drove and parked straight outside the main door in the disabled bays 
1638,tea plus coffee and all we needed for 24 hours or more. Our 5th visit booked.
1639,2 loos available.  No key needed
1640,"We visited Alnwick Castle as part of a holiday. We prebooked our visit because of Covid and had researched the venue so we largely knew what to expect. This was another venue where my expectations were that I would just do what I could and enjoy the atmosphere. I knew that some of it would be challenging.

I always have to choose carefully which wheelchair to use. This was a tricky one. Outside, my mountain trike would have been better but that would have been impossible inside, so I opted for my normal chair with freewheel."
1641,Absolutely great.
1642,The toilet is easily accessible from the front entrance however if someone came through the back entrance they would have to walk to the other end of the station to access the toilet. The toilets are very clean with grab rails in place for stability; there is enough room for a wheelchair to be moved around as well as have a carer to assist if needed.
1643,"Some are great, very helpful, the grumpy guy in ticket office not at all helpful if trying to book seats in advance, have been told numerous times I can't book certain seat's"
1644,"It's up near the Castle esplanade which means there aren't any direct bus links, with narrow pavements and cobbled roads up to the venue. You could get a taxi, but for affordability getting a bus as close as possible to North Bridge would be wisest. There are several buses in the surrounding area: 3, 5, 7, 8, 14, 35."
1645,"wheelchair access via Allington Street, if walking there is lots of stairs and steps to climb but do have hand rails."
1646,In the main concourse of the west stand it is before the bars once you are through the entrance. It's a cubicle large enough to rotate my power chair and has been clean each time I have been to the ground.
1647,"Toiets were very good. Accessible toilet with RADAR lock adjacent to the Interchange's seating area. The icing on the cake was the Changing Places toilet a short distance from the standard accessible toilet. All toilets were spotlessly clean, modern, well equipped,  right and spacious."
1648,"you can only parl for 3 hours with badge, and its an all day out place. so its a pain yo go out and move the car. very few disabled spaces, lets it down a bit"
1649,"We recently spent a wonderful long weekend at Altnacriche. Our party consisted of 2 families plus a night carer and 2 dogs. The lodge is very spacious , extremely well equipped  yet warm and cosy. One of our children  is a wheelchair user . The specially adapted ground floor suite and wet room was perfect for her needs and even had extra equipment such as hoist and shower chair .the whole property was accessible so she was able to enjoy lots of space to play with her friends and siblings. We enjoyed the hot tub and the grounds are expansive with lovely river views. There is a riverside path at the rear of the property leading into the village and to gorgeous forest walks/cycle paths. 
Overall a fantastic location for a family holiday and completely accessible for those with additional needs. We will definitely be back 😊"
1650,"Very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  If there were problems, they were sorted straightaway, like the water heater went off unexpectedly and the owner came straight round and put on an immersion heater for us."
1651,"This was our third visit and still think it's pretty amazing. The accommodation is really well thought out and everything has been supplied for your needs and comfort. The extremely friendly Kim and her team can supply any extra aids you might require. A s the weather was lovely we had a family party in the beautiful garden and patio and always enjoy the relaxed atmosphere. Do check out the website and look at the photos of the houses -you will be impressed!
Lots of helpful tourist info brochures and even games and puzzles in the hideaway coffee table.  Don't think anyone would leave disappointed."
1652,Very helpful
1653,"All of the staff were kind & helpful and made sure that all of my needs were met without any problems at all.
The show's security guys took me to the lift, (which was big enough for my large wheelchair and my son) and met us downstairs, where they made sure we were seated comfortably in our designated area."
1654,Lovely welcome. Very friendly and keen to ensure our visit was going to be great. Suggested best order of exhibits and films. 
1655,The restaurants in this hotel is amazing.
1656,"Sheffield Botanical Gardens are a delight for plant and park lovers alike, and with a little adventurous spirit a wheelchair user can explore just about every inch of them.
Can you find the bear pit?"
1657,Although their or no toilets within the shop there are toilets including disabled toilets located in the shopping center
1658,Used Cabcars and they parked out front fine for easy loading. Found the public transport links confusing as unfamiliar with the area 
1659,Couldn't be more helpful
1660,Blue Badge holders can arrange to park within the complex by prior notice. Information is available on the website.
1661,We enjoyed our visit a lot and had no accessibility issues. Staff were very helpful!
1662,There are a number of disabled parking bays near to the entry of the ‘Pub with rooms’.   It was good to find level access from the parking area to the pavement.
1663,"Flat entrance, good parking."
1664,"Can't comment on the parking. The Museum is next to the Ring, which is well served by trams, and five minutes (level, good pavements) from Museumsquartier U bahn station, which is fully accessible."
1665,"The museum has level access throughout, wchair entrance to the left of the rotating door. Shop and restaurant has good space to manoeuvre. There are accessible toilets at both the museum and by the cottage.
The cottage itself itself is 10 min walk away via the poets path which is very flat and accessible and decent surface to wheel on. The cottage is accessible, and tho small, worth going to. It is quite bumpy once inside due to the floors being cobbled stones and a bit uneven but nothing to worry about."
1666,lots of disabled parking outside doors
1667,"Step free throughout. Everything on one level. Very clever design of kitchen, bedroom and bathroom meant I could get my wheelchair up to basins and sinks and use all equipment in kitchen.Wet room with all latest tech and shower chair if needed.we’ve just adapted our home but have yet to do the bedroom and I will be trying to reproduce the built in dressing table in the fitted wardrobe - all shelves accessible with drop down rails."
1668,"I found people very friendly in Puerto de la Cruz, and hotel staff, taxi drivers, waiters, shop keepers, etc all spoke English and were very helpful."
1669,On-street parking a short walk from the harbour.
1670,Transport is excellent as Lothian Buses 22 and 35 both come right to the door of Mimi's! Parking is a bit more tricky however and it might be difficult to find spaces nearby.
1671,"Early on in our holiday, we started stopping at La Goleta, whether it be for an iced coffee or Ice cream.  The location was good, as was access with the wheelchair, although we did have to move some seats about to get in okay."
1672,"Reasonable access, it is all on one level"
1673,"At the moment, you have to book a car park ticket (timed) and tickets are not transferable between the different car parks. We booked to park at Riverside Car Park, hoping to be able to get to the priory and the Strid in the same day. We started the route to the priory but it was too steep and had a sheer drop at one side so we turned back and did the Strid Wood walk instead.

There is technically a fully accessible (flat) walk through Strid Woods to the Strid but even in October, it was still very overgrown with nettles so I took the less scary option, even though it was a lot more challenging. In the photos, we did the walk I've marked with a red line. I used my mountain trike and it was a perfect surface, lovely wide path and very beautiful. It was very hilly though and the next day, my neck and shoulders paid the price."
1674,"Plenty of signs showing directions and other entrance information. Steps leading up to the minster however there was also a ramp outside. Lots of staff located around the entrance available for assistance however less staff available once through the minster. Big spacious walk ways, however some smaller pathways, which may be less accessable, leading off into side attractions."
1675,Very accessible theme park with last century feel to it. 
1676,The Grand Theatre are very friendly and accommodating. There is now a new wheelchair lift from street level to theatre level which previously had to be accessed through the bar or a rear emergency exit door. There are only a few steps from street to theatre level so I think putting the lift in was very obliging. Wheelchair spaces are on the side of the seats of the side aisle. There aren't many & you can't book them online but a quick phone call soon sorts it. The theatre provides a free carers ticket too. The staff can't do enough for you.
1677,"Only 1 table that will accommodate a wheelchair, and it's a maze to get to it. Very small table, too."
1678,"On the small side and lacking full changing facilities, but clean."
1679,"Fantastic opportunity for disabled people to have the opportunity to fly in a glider which has been fitted with hand controls. Great volunteers on hand to assist every Friday. Please come along and visit. The clubhouse has ramped wheelchair access, disabled toilets, fantastic food in the cafe and very helpful people on hand to answer any questions you may have.  "
1680,"This disabled viewing deck on the top of stretford end has been newly opened at old Trafford this year. On Saturday the Derby against City was our first time up here. Wow what a view.
First of all the enterance to it is AE5 which is a personal lift that goes up to level 7 which is the top of Stretford End. There is a ticket scanning machine right near the enterance which goes green when the ticket is accepted. You will then get a metal detor put over you and any bottle lids ,bottles, cans or any aunortherised items removed from your person. There is a bag limit size in place, but if you need anything for medical purpose they have to allow you in with it. There are two lifts. You can easily fit 2 mobility scooters or wheelchair in there with a carer. And the lift operator. But due to covid we went in just with us and the lift operator as my Dad is extremely clinically vulnerable. 
Upon getting off the lift you are greated with an open area where there is a small cafe to buy your snacks, drinks and food from. Chocolate bars are £1.60, crisps £1.60 tea and coffee are available at about £2.80 each. Beer avaliable too. All bottle tops will be removed when purchased due to safety reasons. There are plastic cups avaliable too but these are not on view. Also hot food avaliable too, pies and hotdogs and then sweets, chocolate and crisps.

When you go out into the stadium you are greated with 59 wheelchair spaces with a carers space next to the wheelchair space. I would advise for your carer or person with you to get in there seat first as there isn't enough room to get in once the wheelchair or scooter is in place other than standing over the Seat. This is due to the safety glass infront. There are speaks on the roof of Stretford end, we couldn't hear what was getting said on it. But could hear the music clearly out of another set of speakers.
There are toilets on each End on the disabled stand. There is also so some more disabled wheelchair places and ambient disabled. To the left of us all done in in same design . But I cannot comment on how many as it was hard to see.
The Disabled toilets which are fully assessable and ambient disabled toilets too. All very clean photos will follow. There are five steps down to the ambient disabled viewing. Which is just below the wheelchair chair. 
Behind the wheelchair stand there are little areas with a large tv in and seating area along with an amazing view of Manchester out of the windows.
The staff were amazing. Couldn't of done anything else to make the experience any better. So informative and helpful. 
Right near the food area, there is a first aid station which is clearly sign posted.
The view of the pitch is amazing. Being up that high and in all the noise is an experience an a lovely one at that. You can see the majority of the stadium but due to the roof decline you are unable to see much of the East Stand.
Overall another amazing experience at Old Trafford, you can certainly see they have put alot of time, effort and money into the assessability side and making disabled people feel included and part of the Red Army.
We wore our masks through out the game, lots of people were not but that's all down to personal choice. 
As mentioned in my other review of the East Stand disabled viewing car parking can be brought directly from Manchester United on there website, it is £12 for the ticket which is opened 3 hours before kick off. If car parking isnt showing on your account, email assessability and they will add it to your account. Then you can print of the ticket ticket home and let the car park attendance scan it."
1681,The staff who work at Revolution Bar and Restaurant are always pleasant and very helpful. They made my visit a good experience and would always be around to lend a hand if required. 
1682,There were toilets in the public area on the ground floor; including an accessible toilet.
1683,Fantastic show by Reginald D. Hunter in a wheelchair accessible venue with a great bar.
1684,"On street parking locally and also on the main road, opposite La Salsa is the bus stop."
1685,"We find this to be a very attractive, inviting, countryside hotel, close to the M5 motorway, and ideal for a comfortable short visit for coffee or afternoon drinks, and to relax before moving on.
The Holiday Inn Bromsgrove was built in 2000, and renovated in 2010, with the intention to revive the breakfast bar and restaurant area, and is now a modern luxury hotel, with 110 refurbished bedrooms, which includes just one Disabled 
room, on the ground floor.

We have found a brilliant web page with the most complete details for the disabled facilities in this hotel, and if you are not sure about booking an overnight stay here, then do please read this websites details,

Amazing, yet they only have one disabled room.

With an investment of 3.5 million pounds, it also included a purpose built fitness centre, the Revive Health club and Spa, with latest Technogym equipment, an 11 metre heated pool, steam room, sauna, and beauty rooms.

During 2013, the owners of the hotel, Peterson ltd, went into administration on 9th 
Ocotober 2013, and specialists Licensed Solutions were appointed to overseer the hotel. It was then acquired by Kew Green Hotel, who paid around 3.95 million pounds.
For a number of months during the COVID 19 scare, it closed, and became a Red List quarantine hotel for travellers arriving into the UK, At a cost of £2285 a night.
It reopened its doors as a hotel again on 1st November 2021, and we arrived on 3rd November to gladly offer you our review on one of our favourite coffee haunts.

There is a pleasant inviting entrance into the grounds of the hotel (photo 1) which is an appealing looking hotel, as it gives the feeling of being in the Mediterranean (photo 2), There are three disabled bays, close to the entrance, (photo 3) with just a very small step, a carer could easily get you over this into the hotel, with automatic doors. (photo 4).
You will be given a warm welcome as you enter (photo 5). The reception desk is opposite the lovely fire place, in a large spacious area, very pleasing to the eye, with minimalistic feel (photo 6). 
Along a short passage you arrive at the bar, where coffee or aperitifs are served (photo 7). A lovely comfortable lounge to sit and enjoy your drink, again with that homily feel of a fire (photo 8).
If you wish to find the toilets they are just alongside the main restaurant in a small hallway (photo 9) opposite to the bar, and to the right is the men’s toilet, and over to the left are the ladies, there is not a disabled toilet available. Inside the men’s toilet there is room for the wheelchair ((photo 10) but to go into the cubicle you would have to walk in. You would not get a chair into the ladies.
The entrance into the restaurant, The Cow on the hill, named as it’s a steak grill. (photo 11) then an attractive restaurant with a barn like feel to it, nicely furnished and inviting (photo 12).

The garden terrace is a very nice area, with shrubbery, and pleasant to sit outside 
on a warm day (photo 13). A doorway from there takes you into the breakfast lounge and all the bedrooms (photo 14). It’s a very attractive area to sit and enjoy breakfast, and during the day to work, or have a coffee (photo 15). Alongside this breakfast room is the Revive leisure centre, a delightful heated swimming pool, (photo 16) and the fitness centre (closed now until reopening again in January 2022). A small hallway leads to the lift and bedrooms (photo 17) then the smallish lift, which will take the wheelchair and two people (photo 18) or enter the lightly decorated spacious corridor to go to the disabled room (photo 19).

Our final thoughts
We use this hotel often as a base for either our coffee breaks, or a glass of wine, as there is no parking charges. Our reviews for all the hotels you can read about, are to encourage you to go and try these comfortable hotels for just a coffee or drinks break, without having to stay there overnight, so much better than the crowded noisy high street brands that offer no better a coffee than hotels. 
( If you enjoy reading our reviews, would you be kind enough to tick the (I like) button, as it will help other people to read the review as well.

We really like this hotel and would highly recommend it, as it’s wheelchair friendly."
1686,"Wide open display spaces, ramps and lifts. Staff in almost each room who can help with doors to get out but you may need help with getting in. Three floors with large lifts. No display was so high that I couldn't read/see or touch it from seated.  Some rooms are dark to preserve exhibits. Smooth to ride through and very spacious. Activities were signed and details of touch and audio tours are on their web site."
1687,"All staff are very friendly, from the people who book your tickets to the people who assist me to get on to the train. Whenever I have traveled by train someone has always been there to help me on and off the train with the ramp. "
1688,Getting in was the tricky part as there is a ramped approach but it requires you to pass along the frontage of the shop. Doing this means negotiating the tables and chairs to get by. I could get the the various counters albeit the main one was lowered.
1689,helpful and obliging
1690,"There are two wheelchair accessible toilets one is located in the main building the other is at the other end of the station near the area the coach tour holiday leave from. Both were good basic accessible toilets and were clean.
Radar Key needed for both"
1691,Very nice and friendly and very proud of their wheelchair accessibility!
1692,Accessible toilet but small and not particularly clean. 
1693,"I drove and used the car park. There are 6 disabled spaces. Sometimes the spaces are full so I have to park further away around the back. Sometimes people who don’t have a blue badge park in the spaces.

There is a bus stop right outside the venue."
1694,Costa coffee is conveniently located on the main street in Largs. It is just beside the ferry terminal and only a short walk from the train station. There is ramp access to the entrance and a number of tables to choose from inside. It can get pretty busy but people did offer to move things out of the way when we visited. There is a good choice of food and drinks. 
1695,All brilliant and very knowledgeable.
1696,On arrival after my daughter booking this venue for a treat for both of us after being separated for year and half we were looking forward to having a break.it was described as disabled friendly but sadly the room allocated wasn’t as it had over bath shower. We booked level access.im afraid this is going to be a negative review overall. Totally disappointed and upset never go back again. We were shunted from one room to other only to discover the next room also had over bath shower. I am unable to get into a bath and have level access within my home so this was totally unsuitable for my requirements. I have emailed the customer services at this hotel and did not get a reply to my email.my daughter received a reply apologising for training error and new staff. The receptionists were very polite but did not seem to know which rooms had level access showers. This used to be Hilton brand hotel but is now under Britannia ownership. With all the toing and froing i was completely exhausted by experience. Also dining area we had a waitress apologise and tell us that she might have to interrupt our meal for the bill which I found a bit off putting.
1697,"Just outside the cafe there is offstreet parking for Blue badge holders.
 There is also a bus stop nearby.
 There is also a train station in North Berwick."
1698,No problems. 
1699,"The Grand is directly opposite Torquay railway station and then a 2 minute walk through the car park. The station has a passenger bridge over to the opposite platform, but no lift, but alternatively customers can follow a step free route over a road bridge. There are several buses that pass close by to the hotel. The hotel has a garage and parking is on a first come first served basis. "
1700,The visit to the library was to see the latest exhibition and to find out how access to the reading services would work for me as a powerchair user.
1701,parking is outside the venue. we had no problem parking at 2pm on friday in the easter hols
1702,Ramp at front of building and wide doors.
1703,Great roomy restaurant.  No problem moving about with a wheelchair or scooter or if a person uses sticks or crutches. Tables are a good height and staff are helpful and will move chairs etc to give space for wheelchair user to sit at the table.  Good facilities for young children as well. Excellent and cheerful service.
1704,Clean and easy to find. 
1705,"Access is good at platform 1. There is an accessible toilet in the main ticket office, dropped counters and an induction loop for when purchasing tickets. The waiting room is spacious with very little furniture  and automatic doors to the car park and platform. There are ramps for boarding the trains. The downside to this station is the detour needed for step-free access to the second platform. Customers would have to take the ramp up onto the main street, cross the railway bridge via the road, follow the wheelchair accessible signs round the corner, past the post office and then down to the platform. It's not ideal, especially if you're running late for a train! It is reasonably well sign-posted however."
1706,"The O2 Arena in Greenwich is a major venue for events of many kinds, from music to sport. Using the site of the Millennium Dome, it's been designed with excellent access in mind.
As well as the Arena, the site also houses the smaller indigO2, which is accessible though has not been visited for this review, as well as a cinema and exhibition centre. There are also a wide variety of bars and restaurants, all of which are accessible."
1707,Disabled parking near the entrance.
1708,"The store is located in the Houndshill shopping centre it is a large store with a lot of display stands as you would expect to find. 
The store is very much typical of all the stores under this name."
1709,The lady acknowledged me and the manager was very polite.
1710,"15 of us booked for the Flying Scotsman. We had 2 in electric wheelchairs & booked spaces for all in their accessible carriage. We were boarded first with a ramp for the chairs. One transferred to a chair one stayed in the wheelchair but it was great to be together for an unforgettable day. 

The carriage has a disabled toilet with room to get the wheelchair in and transfer - though it is a little light on space we were impressed to have the provision with grab bars and stuff on an old train.

There were several staff members on hand to help detrain using the ramps. The shop and platforms were crowded for the special day but they, and the restaurant, were all flat access so would possibly be easier to access when quieter in the week or on a non-event weekend. We managed.

The route to/from the adjacent car park is currently a little narrow with works ongoing but still navigable by chair. There are some disabled spaces and you can get a free parking token from the shop if you have a blue badge.

Couldn’t have done better!!"
1711,"As a train lover and knowing a lot about the post office from previous experience I was really looking forward to visiting. I borrowed a wheelchair and had a look at the train but it was impossible for me to go on as no mobility aids are allowed including a cane or assistance from anyone if evacuation is necessary. You need to be able to get out quickly up steep steps, independently. The train itself is like getting into a low bath so no chance.

The exhibitions were interesting but I was instructed to sit by the video whilst my friend rode on the train. I had asked if it was a virtual tour which it isn’t and feel that it would be better if it was so disabled people can experience the train journey that way.

There is a lift down to the train and it’s exhibition space which is accessed by crossing the road between buildings. A helpful attendant made sure crossing was safe. Inside the main building were lots of interesting displays which were easy to access."
1712," From what I recall the whole ground floor is step free.

Upstairs where the only sitting is has no lift and therefore a bit inaccessible. It would be great if all staircases had handrails and lighting could be better.

I know there’s no accessible platform in the downstairs area which could be handy.

Bar area was pretty high too.
"
1713,"Great, most of the gardens were accessible"
1714,"There is an accessible alarmed loo. Fine, everything I need, and clean."
1715,"Lovely venue, great food."
1716,Situated within a large car park which is shared with a cinema and other restaurants. There is plenty of free parking and disabled parking outside the front of the building close to the entrance.
1717,The disabled toilet was out of order and this was not mentioned until I needed to use the facilities.
1718,Plenty of room but basic with the usual disability hand rail pack.
1719,"There are 2 sets of double automatic doors to enter Daisy Taskers which was great because it was torrential rain the day I visited. To exit the restaurant there is an automatic button to open the closet set of double automatic so that the doors don’t open every time people pass the, the button was at a great height for wheelchair users.

I would say the tables are well spaced out to get around the restaurant however, I didn’t have to go around them because we got seated at an outer table although you can see a photo of the table layouts below. There was plenty of space at the table for myself and my friend in our wheelchairs, as well as space for her assistive dog to lie on the floor.

You can also see from the images below that there are booths as well as standard tables. A couple of the booths have chairs that you can move for wheelchair users that can get into the table. The bar is quite high so, if you are visiting Daisy Taskers I’d recommend sitting at a table."
1720,There is a private car park for use and on street parking. There are good bus links to the city centre close by.
1721,"There was an accessible loo downstairs. There was limited turning space due to a large bin. 

Grab rails were around toilet and sink and were of a contrasting navy colour. The toilet seat was also navy. 

The flush handle was small. The sink had a lever tap and the door handle lock was large. "
1722,Low step up from the pavement and quite a heavy door but the staff are alert for wheelchair users and quick to help.
1723,Would need own transport but parking  immediately outside accommodation. National Trust car park in the village.
1724,Step free access into the shop but the doors were manual and heavy. There was no bell to call for assistance. Once in the shop there is space to get around. Fridge has doors that open outwards. The till doesn't have a lowered section and it is difficult to get close too. 
1725,were friendly and offered assistance
1726,Excellent facility
1727,Sited in a pedestrian area.
1728,"The State Library of NSW and The Art Gallery of NSW are fabulously easy. Emily and I can go on a rainy day as always interesting exhibitions and good cafes for coffee and a cake if you fancy!
Just remember to rub the snout of  ll Porcellino  - the bronze boar outside The Sydney Hospital for luck as you are passing.
Another attraction further along College Street is The Australian Museum, easily accessible with changing exhibits."
1729,One accessible loo available. Could be bigger. Plenty grab rails. Highchairs stored in loo take up a lot of room which will make some transfers difficult.
1730,"No access to the comedy venue, which is up a LONG flight of stairs and along a corridor.  The hosts will reserve a seat near the door but that's about it. From memory the female toilets are upstairs but there's no disabled toilet."
1731,"There was an accessible toilet on the ground floor which staff helpfully pointed out. Again if you were in a wheelchair it may be a little snug. They also keep spare high chairs in there. The day I visited it had about 30 helium balloons in it, spares for the tables. So hopefully not a usual occurrence. 
Grab rails present. "
1732,"No changing places toilet and a bit of a scrum if people are all coming out of the toilets at once. The door to the disabled toilet totally blocks off the ladies loo when it is open and it is a bit of a tight turn up a slight ramp into the toilet, not made easier by having to back in. That said it was a little on the small side but clean and not cluttered."
1733,"Blue badge necessary to park on streets nearby during the day. Small step at the door, otherwise excellent."
1734,Access to bowling alley was easy - doors had hooks to hold them open and a ramp to get to the lane.  Small step up to the lane but wasn't a problem with help.  Maybe a bit cramped for several wheelchairs at the lane but luckily the neighbouring lane was empty.  Cafe was a bit cluttered with furniture.
1735,"Was really impressed with the accessibility at this old venue. It's a calm, beautiful place to have a wander or a light lunch. Would make an excellent choice for an accessible event space."
1736,"No trouble getting around, staff very helpfull."
1737,Disabled parking is limited. I4 & Indigo trent barton stop near by.
1738,All areas were accessible. Slopes / Lifts available for access. 
1739,"The public entrance to the Abbey is on the north side and is step free. Before entering the Abbey there is security checks and then if you don’t already have a ticket, you will need to queue to buy one. 
Once inside immediately there was seating, where I rested until the tour started. 

I attended a special Disabled Access Day Guided Tour, with a BSL interpreter, and the route through the Abbey was step free. On the tour were people with a variety of access needs. Aaron and Graz who were conducting the tour, were very aware of the varying needs of the group. The tour was conducted at a slow pace and there were thoughtful stops were seating was available for people with mobility disabilities. The guides were very engaging as the tour was interactive, with interaction and questions encouraged, and the language used by the guides was informative, clear, avoid jargon and appropriate for the needs of the group.

The Abbey have audio guides and pre-recorded descriptive tours for people with a visual impairment.

Recently the Abbey has install lift access to its upper galleries, which I am planning to visit on a return trip.
"
1740,"I'd been wanting to visit The Devil's Porridge Museum for quite some time and the visit there did not disappoint. I would recommend it to anyone visiting the area. The building is modern and has good disabled access. The history of the area told in the museum is very interesting and it has a great mix of artefacts, information panels, film and audio to help bring the history to life."
1741,Small lip to negotiate to get in but roomy inside.
1742,"A family run business selling home made ice cream, cream teas, pies, jams, sweets, beer, etc to take away. Their speciality is ice cream topped with a dollop of clotted cream and take away cream teas. Opposite the shop, by the brook, are fixed picnic tables and  benches which customers can use."
1743,"A temporary ramp can be found at the door to Treadwell’s, which is always out during opening hours. The manual door opens inwards and is narrow, but the area around the door has been left clear which helps.
Inside the shop there was only one path too narrow for the wheelchair, and everything could be accessed by going around the other way anyway. The lower area of the shop, used for workshops, is down a steep flight of arrow steps and is not wheelchair accessible. The counter is low enough for wheelchair users. 
"
1744,"There are 2 branches of Jury's Inn in Brighton (2019), this is for the hotel on the sea front."
1745,Access is good with a curved ramp taking you down to the changing area.  The disable changing room is very spacious and has a height adjustable bed for those that need it.
1746,"Friendly and helpful staff scattered all over the museum - they wear orange vests so they're easy to identify. Sometimes they are a bit intrusive and over-helpful. I would prefer a more tactful approach. I was also dismayed to find on a recent visit (December 2021) that several members of staff stood much too close to me while chatting - this did NOT feel Covid-safe. The café staff are really excellent and will bend over backwards to help with carrying your tray, helping you find a table, etc. "
1747,"Flat entrance which is suitable for both manual and electric wheelchairs, a disabled toilet and very friendly and accommodating staff."
1748,Relied on street parking when I went. So it's your luck whether you find parking on the street or not. There's spaces all the way up the street. Around 15
1749,"There were two lifts in the main building but they are small and of the type that have inner doors on the lift and an outer door on each floor. The outer doors do not open automatically and are very heavy. The lifts do not stop accurately on each floor leaving a small step.

Ramps have been put in many places but the quieter pool has steps to it and the conference room had a step up to it and then 2 steps down inside. There are other doors that are on the conference room level but they were locked and we had to ask for them to be opened. "
1750,"The fish and chips are great and the ice cream is amazing.  The takeaway counter is accessible and the staff are very friendly.  There is a restaurant which is accessible with help - the tables and chairs can be moved.  The toilet is not accessible for wheelchair users.  
The nearest disabled toilet is in the Community centre about 100 yards away across the road.  "
1751,I phoned first and staff at the hill to the esplanade moved barriers to enable us to drive on to the esplanade and we were able to park right beside the entrance. There is a mobility car which I drove my scooter into. It took my husband and me to the highest point in the Castle. Staff were brilliant and so friendly and helpful.
1752,The staff are all very good indeed if you have a problem they will try and help you if you have forgotten somethings they will try and find something for you
1753,All level access
1754,"There are no steps from either access.   Level ground access from Napier Street and throughout building.   Walkway and lift access via Collier Street.
There are induction loops at some tills which are marked with signage.
"
1755,Car park was small and fubctional. No disabled places but to be honest I have never seen another car there. 
1756,Considering this is a brand new building felt overall accessibility was disappointing.
1757,"While the estate is several miles from the train station it can be accessed from nearby bus stops, & also has limited disabled car parking & a taxi rank directly outside the conference centre reception. There is no proper path from the road to the venue if going from the bus stop, so either you must walk on the grass or use the road & keep an eye out for cars."
1758,"When I visited here I got a parking space right outside by the street. This was because the 2 council car parks that are at either side of this restaurant were full, one is right across the road and the other is a 5 minute walk away. Basically due to the restaurant being in the city centre there are plenty of parking spaces nearby and taxi ranks around the town.

There are also lots of bus stops on mainly every street where buses visit regularly from all over Dundee and Angus. The train station is also just roughly a 10 minute walk away, on the other side of Slessor Gardens."
1759,"Very spacious room, plenty of room for this to have adult changing facilities but they were not provided. Changing rooms could perhaps pursue this. Unfortunately the room is also used as baby changing facility so it can be occupied with families while disabled people are waiting to use it."
1760,"Broadmarsh has it's own multi-storey car park location just next to the centre, which has a number of disabled car parking spaces. There is also Broadmarsh bus station where all major bus routes stop at, this is located in the underground of the centre, with a level access available. Nottingham train station is also less than 5 minute walk away."
1761,"2 accessible toilets (one in the downstairs cafe, one in the upstairs cafe)
 Plenty of room to manoevre in the upstairs toilet with a single handrail. The accessible toilet upstairs is the only one provided for all patrons.
I did not use the toilet downstairs so cannot comment

"
1762,I use a walking stick with no issues
1763,"This is not close to any major cities, and the closest town is only accessible by car with a fifteen minute drive. There are open grounds, however, there are cobbles stones over some of the grounds."
1764,"Easy to use, clean and a good size."
1765,"The restaurant is in central Edinburgh, so well served by buses. There's some limited disabled parking bays directly outside the restaurant, but we were able to find somewhere nearby to park. You can find more about the parking here https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20085/parking_spaces/507/parking_bay_locations"
1766,"No awkward steps, although you'll have to bump over the doorway strip to get in to your room... see below!

The only thing that I'd note would be that there are some heavy doors, generally between the lift vestibule and the corridors with the rooms on them - probably fire doors I assume, hence the weight? If you're with someone else I think it'd be ok because they could open the doors, but me and my TravelScoot had to use our patented ""drive at the door and smash it open"" approach! Of course, coming back the other way (to 'pull' doors) was more of a challenge (drive up, hold the door handle with your one working hand, reverse to open the door enough to wedge a body part in the gap, pull the door open enough to drive over the threshold, try not to squish body part in the process...)

On a similar note, you have to use your keycard to unlock the room, and then get in to your room before it closes and locks again. My TravelScoot couldn't get over the doorway strip in my first room (623) without a run-up, so trying to swipe the keycard, push the door open, and reverse and then accelerate over the doorway strip before the door swung shut was certainly a challenge. Having said that, in my second room (323) something was different and I was able to swipe the keycard and push the door open on the TravelScoot without a run-up to bump over the doorway strip. Luck of the draw I suppose!"
1767,"The disabled toilet was close enough to reception area, easy to arrive at, but then found it smallish, and untidy. Grab rails are there for you."
1768,Top marks for the toilets! The main accessible loo in the Square even had an automatic door - a great plus for me and many others who are powerchair users. Equally notable was the accessible loo in the George Street complex - full marks to the designers who built a ramp that allowed enough space to turn to get in and out of the door - a feature missing in all the other pop up loos I've visited during the festivals. Once inside the loos were very spacious and allowed for a carer to easily move around. 
1769,Friendly and kind.
1770,"The centre itself is a bit off the beaten track, so a walk if arriving by foot.  However there is a large car park with plenty of disabled bays available."
1771,We took a taxi as the zoo is in the middle of a large park. There is a car park right next to the zoo for people who are driving but unfortunately out of staggering range of the entrance. It alleges to be a 15 minute walk from Heuston station but it seemed further than that.
1772,The library is accessible by ramp at the main entrance w/o steps. There are handrails at the entrance and through the hall way. There library is on one floor so there are no elevators needed.
1773,No lifts
1774,Helpful woman at the ticket desk got us the right discounts and explained how the joint ticket with Vindolanda worked.
1775,"We were looking for a footpath to explore and this ex railway line looked a possible.  We joined at the northern end, at the Old Hayling Halt station. In hindsight (see review) we’d have probably been better to search for the southern railhead.
We had my wife’s GoGo Explorer car boot mobility scooter with us. This has small solid wheels and no suspension. Given the variable nature of the path (and the car park!) you really need one with proper pneumatic tyres and/or suspension. 
Great views over to Portsmouth, and plenty of ‘vitamin N’ (nature) and wildlife."
1776,Staff were really helpful and got the tubes etc that I needed from the cycle section.
1777,All very helpful and knowledgeable about the site.
1778,Did the job. No red cord or space to turn around so had to rev reverse out. Bin in the way of transferring.
1779,"Small theatre with bar and restaurant housed in a former water mill, on the banks of the River Thames. Venue offers a combo package of 2 course meal and theatre ticket. The is good accessibility.

UPDATED:  see updates below"
1780,For a power chair user access is really good and straight forward. Multiple large lifts available. Nice and wide corridors and rooms to manoeuvre round.
1781,Parking up a side street for disabled with badge. Perfect
1782,"Based at the Albert Dock, there is plenty of parking. This is a stop on the tour bus as well."
1783,"Apart from buying my ticket for St Mary's and showing my ticket at the entrance I didn't interact with anyone. However, my brief experiences were fine. Everyone spoke English."
1784,"There was a well signposted loo near the bar.  It was reasonable clean and spacious. It had grab rails by the loo.  But no alarm cord, plus paper towels were not anywhere near the washbasin. Major issues for me were (i) I had to get through a door so heavy, I couldn't manage to get it open even with my full weight against it (ii) no bar on the door to enable me to close it once inside (iii) tiny bolt which was all I had to hold to close the door and too small for me to hold .  After the heavy door, there was a sharp left turn, and the baby changing station on the wall - broken and in the way."
1785,"Ideal location, all staff very friendly. Got parking (pot luck) in the general retail carpark by the Travel Lodge. Good sized room, two single beds, bathroom standard/new design with shower. Windows did open and fans are provided - we took our own large fan but it was 'pass out' hot. We would not go back because of the heat."
1786,"Their accessible facilities include personal care resources, a passenger lift, grab rails, wide corridors and a contrasting decor. An induction loop is available on request.
"
1787,Access tight and only just able to fit in. Must reverse out so if you are unable to stand locking the door would be impossible.
1788,I would advise on taking a taxi to and from Maspalomas but the kerbs are difficult for wheelchair users.
1789,Accessible clean and spacious toilets
1790,Ramped access
1791,The disabled bays are very close to the entrance of hotel.
1792,Both men's and women's  with rails and space to manoeuvre.
1793,Parking is fine.
1794,The Toilet has grab rails and there was ample turning space to manoeuvre in the wet room. 
1795,The staff that we met throughout the visit were extremely friendly and very positive. They were quick to answer my questions about the accessibility and to tell me about the alternative accessible toilet. They also suggested that it may be better to drive from the visitor centre to the Burns cottage as it was some distance. Generally the staff and their enthusiasm made for an enjoyable visit which did to a certain extent overcome some of the challenges.
1796,It is easy enough to get into the hotel. 
1797,"Clean, although not particularly spacious. "
1798,There is a new lift to the rear of the premises. You need to alert staff as they have to come down and unlock an external door for you. Prezzo loses a star for storing beer kegs outside the lift door. Once inside only upper level seating is accessible near to kitchen. I like it but one might feel removed from the main restaurant and the atmosphere of people dining together. 
1799,"Automatic doors both entrances.  Access around store is good with ramps. Occasional chair if you want to sit down.
Lift down to Cotswold clothing.
Lift up to cafe is very small and breaks down frequently according to staff.  Very tight for a big wheelchair plus carer.
Upstairs is straight into children's play space. Narrow aisles. 
You feel like it causes a cafuffle people moving chairs and children to let you past. I don't want to make a ""grand entrance "" ! "
1800,"There was an accessible loo with radar key access.
Room to manoeuvre my wheelchair and for a carer to come in.
Grab rails.
The emergency red cord was tucked behind the pipes but it was hanging to the for so I freed it, unfortunately I left my red cord cards at home.
It was found clean and tidy."
1801,Great. There are lots of accessible parking bays close to the entrance of the shop. These are clearly marked and you can then follow clear paths and crossings to the store entrance. There are also regular buses on the main road outside Meadowbank Centre. These are Lothian buses and are wheelchair accessible.
1802,"We drove, in fact it took 4 cars to take all of us and our equipment there! One place on the drive but loads of street parking."
1803,"All were nice, friendly and Helpfull especially women with DVD and at the gates."
1804,"Easy access, electric doors, all wide open space plenty of room for wheelchair, friendly staff, good facilities"
1805,There is no disabled parking but there are spaces near by. Bus stop right outside
1806,"For such a small shop in an old building, the disabled access is surprisingly good! The wide door was propped open already when I arrived, there was no step to get in, and once inside there was enough room to move around and turn. The shop is very small, so be aware for this if you do use a larger powerchair or need a bit of extra room to turn easily. Everything in the shop is at a low height which makes it easy to view from a seated position. While this is not a sit-in cafe, there is a bench outside the shop window if you'd like to take a minute to sit and enjoy your shortbread! I also spotted some stools stacked inside which could be used if you require a break from standing. "
1807,Once on the beach I was fine (I have a power trike).  Slightly tricky over dunes. Help was needed on path through dunes in places and for a few metres at top of the beach.
1808,"Staff very helpful and supportive. Reception staff welcomed us, couldn’t do enough to help."
1809,"Staff were very helpful, though one was very unsure how to use the lift. "
1810,"Lovely staff, fantastic food, gorgeous surroundings and pretty good accessibility."
1811,I wish i could rate higher
1812,"Entrance to the train station is via one of three entrances. The main entrance is beside the car park, where there are several accessible car parking spaces for blue badge holders. There is a drop off/pick up area adjacent to the door of the ticket office. "
1813,There are seats. Binary on signs. Lifts. Power assisted doors
1814,The staff are helpful and knowledgeable about their hearing loop. Hopefully it will be fixed for the next visit.
1815,"Upon entrance, there is a wheelchair lift to take you from the front door to the main body of the restaurant, in order to avoid the steps. This was well sign posted, and was available for non wheelchair users to use too. 
Although there are a lot of booths, there are also a large number of more accessible seating with spaces for wheelchairs to be placed."
1816,"The disabled access to and including the walk is very good, smooth, flat and spacious. There is one section where you would have to take extra care as there is a straight drop down to the beach of 5 or 6 feet on one side but this should not be a problem as the path is nice and wide.

I have only given 4 stars however, as I feel that there could have been an accessible walkway made available onto and along the beach itself. Having said that, access for the walk itself is great."
1817,Few disabled spaces round about
1818,"Floors were level, doors were wide. "
1819,"There are a number of accessible toilets situated around the stadium, and accessed via RADAR key. They are variable in size, shape and design. All those visited have drop-down rails and space for side transfer, though they could do with some updating and upgrading. There is likely to be a queue directly after the end of a match!
There is also one (rather small) accessible toilet in the nearby Tesco store and during major events at the stadium a portable accessible toilet is often situated in the Tesco car park. On most recent visits there has been a Mobiloo parked on the stadium concourse - this has an accessible toilet with hoist and changing bench. The organisers have told me this will be a regular feature on match days."
1820,There's a bell on the door which you can ring to ask for assistance. There is step free access and a decent width of door. It's a lot bigger than it looks from the outside - it was spacious and the furniture layout is flexible so you can arrange as you wish.
1821,The car park is huge.  The attendant told us there were blue badge spaces but we didn't find them as it was so busy! However there was plenty of room. The estate charges per car with no concessions - £8 but this enables you to access any of their car parks the same day (so you can relocate and do the abbey the same day for example).
1822,"Large car park, disabled spots near the entrance although they don’t have the blue badge sign , they are marked by wall signage. Part of the car park is well packed stones and part tarmac."
1823,"Level entrance , all tables accessible and friendly staff to make you feel welcome and comfortable."
1824,"There is a good accessible loo in the main lobby, and the disabled bedroom had very good disabled facilities - grab rails, shower seats etc - all very clean and well maintained"
1825,A mobile Changing Places loo for festivals and open spaces. 10 vehicles on the road. More to come. 
1826,"I had been to the links bar many times so I was interested to see what it looked like after the black ivy had taken it over. A friend and I went there for a drink. What a change! It looks really smart and classy. The black ivy is wheelchair accessible and has a disabled toilet. On the night it was particularly quiet probably because there was a snow storm forecast and it was a week night. There are large screens for watching sport. They sometimes have live music (see photo of piano etc) and I believe you can also play ping pong for free on their tennis tables. We had a lovely evening drinking cocktails, eating snacks and chatting."
1827,Very friendly and nothing was too much trouble.
1828,"Good access to the visitor centre, cafes, toilets and all paths with the exception of the access to the canal path which has a great path but a very steep access to get on to it."
1829,"Automatic doors at entrance, though did have to pass through a heavy door on the way to the department, but staff assisted with doors. Good signage throughout, and huge information board at Welcome desk at main entrance. Lifts available. Plenty of seating on ground floor, and on route to outpatients and X-ray department.
Volunteers available at Welcome to desk to assist those requiring help to transport with chairs to the wards and other departments .
Induction loop available at Welcome Desk and all reception desks.
Translation services available, but advised to advise of need of this prior to attending
"
1830,"There is a ramp up to the main entrance into the retail area. But three steps from there into the galleries and artisans.
This can be circumvented by exiting via the ramp, and with the help of staff, reenter the building via a short temporary ramp through the emergency exit. This ground floor has a uneven surface. But there is a self-service lift from that (ground) floor to the gallery in the first and silk weaver on the second floor. This second floor has a very low ceiling with beams - though not a problem if you're in a wheelchair!
"
1831,"Managed to get the powered wheelchair onto the sand but got a bit stuck. Lots of us there, so we got it out but Rachel had a fantastic time in the sun, on the beach with her dog Mabel"
1832,"First visit since COVID restrictions commenced. 
Quick and easy visit, with COVID restrictions in place
Helpful , friendly staff"
1833,There were plenty of disabled parking spaces . 
1834,There were plenty of signs to guide you to the entrance and you are provided with an accessible route around the gardens. On a dry day you can be more adventurous and use the grass and access more areas. Even in wet conditions there are still areas to view and you can then retire to the café on the outside of the gardens
1835,There are plenty of disabled parking spaces available in all of the car parks at Braehead. There are various car parks around the centre for easy access to certain parts of the centre.
1836,There are accessible toilets located within the St Enochs Shopping Center. 
1837,"Level entry from the street. Restaurant is not overly spacious, so make a reservation and inform them that you are in a chair - they are quite helpful with moving tables and chairs around, but the space is tight. "
1838,"On arriving there were 4 disabled spaces in the main car park. We got a space but when it is busy, this isn’t enough in terms of disabled spaces. Out of the car park you go slightly down hill via a ramped path past the café and shop area. Easy to navigate the path. Go straight past the grassed picnic benches area on your right, over the bridge and veer left onto the Devil’s Gorge path. There are some areas where you need to take extra care due to tree stumps and steep banks but generally good. Lovely nature walk."
1839,"There's a wide raised ledge (about two inches high) to get in and you'll need someone to hold the (large) door open for you. If you want to venture farther back than the front bar, you might have to do some nifty manouevring if you're on wheels. The cosy back bar is pretty cluttered with heavy furniture and narrow awkwardly angled passes. The very back bit (I think they call it 'the pontoon') is much more spacious and forgiving to wheels."
1840,"There were disabled toilets in most of the toilet blocks and the toilet blocks were located in many places around the zoo. The toilets were very easy to find as they were always signposted. The toilets were clean, tidy and spacious. "
1841,The building is positioned on a corner therefore the entrance is not immediately obvious when coming from the direction of Argyle St and the sign could be a little larger (you can't see it from a distance) however you know you are in the right place as it has a picture of a purple cat sipping tea on it! There are no steps in / around the premises. There is seating at the entrance and in the café itself. The menu font could have been clearer / slightly bigger but staff are happy to answer any questions about it. 
1842,Lots of Disabled parking on level C in both car parks.  Access from each level to the shopping centre where there are lifts available to travel between floors.  There is free parking for all visitors to the Centre whether disabled or not which is a great service for everyone.
1843,Friendly
1844,We used the super tram and walked 10 minutes slow walk from Infirmary Road tram stop.
1845,"The cemetery has a north entrance in Old Brompton Road and a south entrance in Fulham Road. Both entrances are totally step-free. Beware of awkward kerbs at the north entrance. It's better to use the small quiet slip-road in front of the cemetery to approach the entrance. 

There is a magnificent domed chapel near the south entrance. This is a must-see, and it has fully step-free access via a stone ramp. See my photos below."
1846,Not being sure how to find the hotel it was easier than expected. Head for the Apple store and then go around the corner. I was surprised at the size of the hotel and how good the facilities are.
1847,"Amazing food, nice atmosphere and good accessibility"
1848,Flat entrance. We were in room upstairs but there was a lift .
1849,Helpful and friendly.
1850,Plenty of disabled parking right in front of the entrance
1851,Great hotel for kids and families. Good access and space available in rooms and a wide range of activities available for all. Some would be unfortunately be inaccessible or wheelchairs. Food and location were excellent and the hotel staff were very helpful.  Evening entertainment was onsight and very enjoyable.
1852,Staff are helpful and friendly.
1853,I used the toilets at the stadium and felt that the disabled toilet was not big enough for me and wheelchair to move around in.
1854,There are a lot of compromises at this hotel. You access it via the basement which means the security guard letting you in via the deliveries ramp and then getting a lift up. If coming down you stop on the ground floor and need to find a member of staff to use a key to send you lower - fine for us but would be a problem if you were on your own. 
1855,"In keeping with most RSPB sites the disable facilities were excellent.. Several electric scooters small and large were available, as were wheelchairs. Access to all the parts of the site that we visited was good, all pathways had good hard surfaces and the hides had  good access and room for the scooter. All making it a very enjoyable visit. One slight criticism might be that access to the disabled toilet was rather awkward for the large scooter that I used, and it was not possible to access the lift to the cafe with this machine. This is probably because the building predates the availability of scooters."
1856,"The subway system, has certain key stations that have lifts/elevators, but in my experience, the reliability of the lifts is somewhat patchy. For wheelchair users the bus system allows for access to most places and all buses have lifts to get on and off the bus. The drivers operate the lifts. Just stick your hand out when the bus arrives."
1857,"Accessible toilets accoss the road in Excalibur cafe, and in car park a few minutes walk away."
1858,no accessible bays at front entrance to hotel 3 bays at entrance to spa
1859,I visited as part of a private taxi tour so I was dropped off at the entrance gates and collected from their too. I don't know about public transport but I think there is a hop on hop off sightseeing busy that stops here.
1860,"This temporary venue for Edinburgh Rugby  may be good for the players and able-bodied fans but is hopeless for disabled supporters (if I wasn't such a rugby nut, I wouldn't have bothered!)"
1861,"Double door with helpful reception into the shop. 
Disabled lift. Disabled toilets "
1862,"£6 for parking but £2 for the disabled,not many spaces where we parked but think there were more elsewhere.Surface was gravel so may be hard in a manual chair."
1863,"The thing I particularly appreciated about the staff here was their willingness to be flexible when I first called to book the room. Wherever I go, it's usually such a hassle to find a family room with an accessible bathroom, and I'm often told there's no way the configuration of the accessible room can be changed. However, although Oban Hostel's staff initially reported that their accessible room was only for two people, they went away and thought about it, and quickly came up with the possibility of squeezing in an extra child bed.

At the end of our visit, I made sure I told the staff at reception about the difficulties I'd had with the accessible bathroom, because that's better than just moaning about it online, right?! To their credit, they were interested in what I had to say and grateful I'd explained things, saying that it was good someone had spoken up because otherwise they would never know there was a problem. I told them everything I've said here, and I think someone was taking notes, although it's hard to say whether those people were in a position to get any changes made. Oban hostel, if you're reading this, my recommendation would be to drive down and take a look at The Sill hostel in the far north of England, where there are great examples of modern disabled bathrooms."
1864,Towards rear of store but very easy to get to
1865,"Toilet was in the bar area. Big enough to accommodate the wheelchair, had grab rails in appropriate places. Toilet was clean, easy to find & there would have been room for a carer if needed. "
1866,"I couldn't find any signage to the accessible toilet, I had to ask staff where it was. 

The toilet has the usual fold-down grab-rail but it was partly detached from the wall: dangerous and negligent. See my pictures below. I was shocked by this. Two stars lost for this.

The red emergency cord is MUCH too short. It stops a good metre short of the floor. See my picture below. It should reach all the way to the floor, so that it can be pulled by anyone who falls over in the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back. Two stars lost for this. 

"
1867,"Well signed and ramped. Shared with baby changing so manoeuvring the wheelchair wasn’t simple and the loo grab rail wasn’t really accessible. As usual, the loo roll holder was behind the seat! "
1868,"Trying to enter the venue could be an issue if wheelchair users are there on there own as it is up 3 steps and there is not always staff at the door. Once in the venue it is fine, with either ramps or a compact lift, enough space for 1 wheelchair at a time, to get you to the different halls."
1869,"I went to see a Fringe show at the Assembly Roxy venue, Movin Melvin Brown.
Outside the venue is quite uneven as the street is cobbled stone. It was also quite difficult finding dropped down kerbs for my powered wheelchair. 
There is an o street bar area which has benches and seats for pre/post show drinks. Although it was on street level which should mean easier access , no provision was made for wheelchairs as the only way to get to the bar was from the pavements which had no dropped kerb and the bar was also sectioned off on road level by barriers right along and also ""wooden planter box things"" which made it look pretty but with absolutely no entrance for wheelchairs!
The entrance to the venue was up a few steps so I was told I would be taken to the side entrance which is beside the stage before everyone else was in to allow me time to get settled. I was taken to the side entrance but everyone was already in and sitting in seats directly behind my space which was in the front row. The stage was so close my knees almost touched the stage and it was quite tight to manoeuvre into the wheelchair space. Eventually the people behind me moved to make it a little easier to get in place."
1870,majoritu of venue is wheelchair accessible
1871,"fine and accessible, if a little far from the bar - toilet in hotel rooms fine."
1872,"There are a few nearby car parks with disabled parking bays, and there are multiple bus stops very close to the pub."
1873,"Pretty good. A long smooth ramp up to the accessible entrance which is clearly signposted by a chalkboard. Inside, the tables are nicely spaced apart and chairs are movable. It's table service. The restaurant is nice and bright with natural light in the conservatory. "
1874,"Big car park to rear of the centre, close to the train station and city centre. "
1875,"Snow factor has many people with mixed abilities coming through its doors. And i find this to be the only environment where my son isnt treated as having ""additional support needs"" but is just treated equally with the next person waiting in the queue for the tow-rope- which is ace."
1876,Very helpful. They were available when we needed them.
1877,The sea front is about a 10 minute downhill walk from Brighton train station. There are also some local buses that stop nearby.
1878,"There is plenty of parking available onsite, it is generally quite quiet so there should be no problem parking next to the venue. If that is full, there is ample parking just behind it.

There are buses travelling to Findhorn from Inverness, Aberdeen and points in between but there would be a 4 to 5 minute walk to the Art Centre from the main road.



"
1879,"The staff are incredibly helpful but the venue isn't really accessibl, there a loads of stairs and no lifts, you have to enter through the back door.






































"
1880,"A home from home is right but not just from the disabled persons point of view. We went with my daughter and her 3 children who loved the pool. My wife and daughter found the kitchen excellent with the washing machine an unexpected bonus, allowing the children to wear their favourite clothes more than once. It also reduces the need for you to be on the suitcase weight limit when flying. While we enjoyed wall to wall sunshine every day and temps of 35' C the veranda on 2 sides provides shade and catches the breeze, making the temperature enjoyable. The WAV is essential for wheelchairs users as it allowed us to explore.the area."
1881,It was immediately obvious that the organisers had considered accessibility and gone to great lengths to welcome disabled visitors.
1882,"There is one in Asda, but it is too far away and no clear signs for it in McDonald's."
1883,Wheelchair accessible holiday cottage. Good parking right next to property. Wide doorways. Shower room. Clean. Modern. Well stocked. Pets welcome.
1884,"This is just a local supermarket, so there wasn't a lot of signs or directions to it.

At the main entrance (which you enter straight from street level) there are automatic doors.
There are a flight of stairs which take you down to the shop, but beside this there is a large lift.
The lift is used not only by people with disabilities, but frequently needed by people with their trollies/shopping.

Within the shop, it is completely level throughout, and there seemed enough space to be able to move round the aisles. 
They have wheeled baskets as well as trollies. I didn't notice any trollies specifically for wheelchair users, but it's possible there was."
1885,"They have worked incredibly hard to make the building as accessible as possible. There is level access from the street, although the hill getting to the main door is pretty steep!  It does at times feel a little disjointed internally, as you have to pop on and off a couple of lifts while in there if you want to get to the snacks etc. but it's well worth it!"
1886,"Despite being a century’s old ruined priory in the middle of rural Yorkshire, and probably a listed building at that, Bolton Abbey and the surrounding park is highly accessible.
 There are multiple car parks spread over the area, and once you have paid entry to one of them, you can transfer between car parks as many times as you like simply by showing your ticket. There are also plenty of disabled parking bays available, as well a few nearby bus stops and a small train station, although I’m not certain how accessible these are.
 I usually go to the Cavendish Pavilion car park, which is relatively central. There is a café and gift shop by this car park, which are tight to move around in a wheelchair as they are rather small, but still remain relatively accessible. Motability scooters can be hired at the gift shop for the day, at a small cost, which means you don’t have to bring your own. The disabled toilet is next to the other toilets, and has a radar key lock which prevents the facilities being misused. The cubicle is spacious, but lacks full changing facilities.
 There is an accessible, mile-long pathway going from the Pavilion up to the Strid, the narrow but deep gorge which acts as a bottleneck to the river Wharfe. This path is steep in places, but manageable for manual wheelchairs with the appropriate pacing. The wheelchair platform for the Strid is near enough to give an excellent view of it, without putting you in any danger.
 There is another accessible, mile-long pathway going from the Pavilion to the abbey ruins. Wheelchairs must use the driveway that cars pass down to reach the car park from the road, but is wide enough to accommodate this. The kerb drops onto the pavement at the top are poorly maintained, and do jolt the wheelchair quite a bit, but are OK. Again, parts are steep. The pavement goes around the outside of the park, turning back into the smooth pathways at a wide gate near the abbey. From there the outside of the abbey can be explored from the lawn, which is a little bumpy but well-kept. The remaining chapel is fully wheelchair accessible, and even when busy is easy enough to travel around smoothly. Some of the pathways do have steps on them, but using the lawn bypasses these.
 Opposite the Pavilion is a bridge which leads to some fields good for having picnics, and getting a good view of the river, which are all wheelchair friendly.
 At the Strid car park there is an accessible tea room and nature trail, but you will need to drive to this car park as this cannot be accessed from the Pavilion."
1887,"Capital Centre, Queen Street.There is a wide open doorway with level access to the shopping centre. Immediately to the right of this entrance is a disabled toilet."
1888,Rustic but functional is the best description. The accessible loo is in a wooden building alongside the standard toilets. A pathway cross the grass to get to the loos or you can take the steps if you don't need level access. The surface to wheel over is firmer than it looks being some reinforced material under the grass.
1889,"The only public museum entrance involves walking across a small but unavoidable area of raised cobbled stones. The cobbles are quite large and my crutch got stuck in between them once or twice. 

Once inside access is easy. The entrance is step free. Immediately inside there is an information desk and a seating area. Directly in front is the self service café with free standing tables and chairs. There are lifts to all floors. Some of the floor boards are uneven.

On our visit we went to see the Roman Dead exhibition which was on the ground floor. There were 3 - 4 steps or a ramp to get into the exhibition. At the entrance to the exhibition were some portable stools. Inside the exhibition the display cabinets were well laid out. Where the skeleton remains were on display most of the cabinets could be viewed at both sides which would enable wheelchair users to see the entire remains more easily. There were a couple of videos, which were captioned. However there is no fixed seating in the exhibition. Therefore if you need a seat you will need to get a stool. "
1890,"There is inbuilt ramp to get it, the doorway is not especially wide so larger wheelchairs may struggle. There is a lowered counter to pay, it’s table service which is helpful, and the tables are a good height. One time I went and there weren’t any of the ‘normal’ tables and just a booth but the staff were helpful and said it was ok to get out of my chair and have it sitting in the isle so I could sit in the booth. It s quite a busy cafe so getting a table on weekends is hard if you don’t book. "
1891,Good throughout the venue although there are a few ramps and barriers to be negotiated.  All the doors are automatic.  There is  adequate signage across the centre.
1892,Always plenty of staff on hand to help and they are very friendly and approachable. Nothing is too much trouble.
1893,"A very happy shopping experience for a wheelchair user, and a good accessible toilet which has a few things badly wrong with it."
1894,"This is such a great spot for a spontaneous picnic. The shop is very small but the concept seems to be that you take-away and eat outdoors at the picnic tables or somewhere in the vast Helix Park. Despite the small size, this little cafe is pretty accessible!"
1895,"Staff are all fabulous. Helpful and friendly, and seemingly having a sixth sense to know when you're going to need a door to be opened!"
1896,"The café is in Teignmouth town centre, which is a five minute level walk from the train station. Teignmouth train station has step free access available. There are also a number of local buses that stop near by."
1897,"There are no step-free stations nearby. Several bus routes will drop you off at South Kensington Station or outside the Victoria and Albert Museum or the Natural History Museum, from where it's a short roll/walk to the Science Museum."
1898,"Parking is available nearby, either on street or in the Grand Arcade car park. There are 4 blue badge parking spaces immediately outside the theatre entrance on Peas Hill, 2 in Wheeler Street and 7 on King's Parade, all close to the theatre. Accessible buses are available into the city centre."
1899,The staff were friendly and listened to us and supported us with our communication needs.
1900,Spacious and clean
1901,Fantastic pastries baked on the premises. You can watch the bakers at work through the glass floor! Small lip to get in but its roomy inside and an accessible loo toward the back of the shop. Staff with bring orders to tables outside too.
1902,"No parking outside restaurant, but plenty of blue badge spaces within 300m walk."
1903,Bearing in mind the slope it's easy enough to get in there.
1904,"There was an accessible toilet on Level 1, next to other toilets. The accessible toilet was spacious, it had a single grab rail, space under the sink and no emergency cord, see photo. It was clean."
1905,All floors were level and easy to use. Lifts were sometimes hard to find. Roughly half of the displays were too high to read without standing. Wheelchair hire was quick and easy.
1906,The toilet is quite small and doubles as baby changing. There is limited circulation space and side transfer space available if you are able to reposition the paper bin.  No red cord. 
1907,"This guest house ticks all my boxes as it's totally wheelchair accessible - we had a lovely room called Cairnmore which was huge and a lovely shower which makes things so much easier. 
Choice of breakfasts is good and all the produce is locally sourced and cooked beautifully.

The Guest house is run by Liz and her niece Lisa and they are so friendly and knowledgable of the area and places to go too.

We come back here annually as they make us feel at home and totally welcome - would definitely recommend this guest house for anyone with mobility issues needing somewhere to lay there head - beds are top notch too.
Free WIFI for all that need it.
"
1908,"Surprising great, it is a historical building and so the restrictions are huge, but they have worked awfully hard to make it accessible :) hence 4 stars "
1909,Lovely peaceful place to visit with a great cafe
1910,"Looking for a pit stop whilst shopping at Hermiston Gate? Indulge in a delicious doughnut and see them being made whilst you queue. A spacious seating area and a good sized accessible toilet. Staff are more than happy to help, taking your items to the table for you."
1911,"There is no onsite parking, the nearest car park is off Bootham.  A number of buses stop immediately outside and taxis tend to use the bus stop to drop off.  There is a taxi rank around the corner."
1912,"Easy to access through main door, although strip was slightly raised "
1913,Car park was close to the museum and easy to find.
1914,Easy Access park with outdoor cafes - good for wheelchairs and dogs!
1915,Access around the station concourse is good and places are well signposted.
1916,There is seating but most of it is on the grass with no path to them. There are ramps wherever there are stairs and some of the paths are very steep (I couldn't go up most of it.) Little to no signage and if there is any it is small print without braille
1917,"I didn't use the toilets when I visited because given the pop-up nature of this market they weren't the best! They are tucked in the corner at the very back and up a set of steps. I didn't see any designated accessible loos, so if they exist they are poorly sign posted. "
1918,"The loos are through a quite heavy door, but generally a member of staff appears in a flash, seemingly from out of nowhere, to open it for you. There's gents, a ladies and a separate accessible loo. The door to the accessible loo is slightly awkward to open if you're on your own (because it's so big - you have to reverse for miles!), but there's generally someone around to help. Loads of room inside. It's always been clean when I've been there."
1919,"Plenty of staff around to offer advice and give additional information about the animals.
All staff we spoke to were friendly and well informed."
1920,"My stay at the Hilton in general was enjoyable and the building, rooms and restaurant are all very accessible. "
1921,Two disabled loos beside the shop.
1922,Staff are very friendly and helpful. They will provide assistance if required and are very knowledgeable about the exhibits and the museum layout. They provide useful guides to assist with accessibility and direction to exhibits
1923,"Staff were very helpful and provided assistance with the doors, refreshments, adjusting furniture, and general information."
1924,"This shopping centre is spacious with an entrance either side of the building. There is a good mix of shops within, including clothes stores, shoe shops, food outlets, banks, travel agents, book shops and two good sized supermarkets. "
1925,The parking is in front of the property on the gravel forecourt.  The owners were happy to clear a path for us which made access much easier. 
1926,Two spaces reserved for disabled parking in carpark but they are the same size as all others. There is no bus route close to the hotel. 
1927,Very helpful staff
1928,no toilets onboard but there are nearby use a radar key
1929,Ubahn had been well adapted despite being a pre war railway. See above. 
1930,"My experience was awful and so bad I wrote to them but they haven't bothered replying...  The information on their website suggests a certain degree of accessibility which just isn't there.  

Access to the bear house involved crossing the grass.  When we reached the house, the entrance had a large lip which my carer had to tip me up and over.  This wouldn’t have been an option in my electric wheelchair.  

Then we headed to the dolls house section.  The ramp was not flush to the ground and at the other end was not flush to the floor inside, again requiring my carer to lift and tip the wheelchair.  Once in, not all houses are visible because they are too high.

The wheelchair map wasn't given to us and when we found out about it, staff made a song and dance about getting it for us.

Access to the cafe was via the toilets and two heavy doors, one of which opened onto a slope making access exceptionally difficult.

I believe access to the hall itself was impossible."
1931,Blue Badge parking is available in the adjacent car park. Vehicles can drop off out side the main door. There's also an accessible bus service that runs into town. The Exhibition railway station is a short distance away if travelling by train.
1932,Flat access off car park across road and on to the former railway track. No steep gradients in the three or four miles I explored.
1933,Level access all throughout the visitor centre. There was a lift down to the castle with ramped access to the castle site including to a viewing platform looking over the water. There was a lowered counter at the shop for wheelchair users.
1934,"Visited with a rollator user.  Overall a highly positive experience.  Staff were super-helpful once we were inside, especially the security team. 
Beware this rating is just for the main hall - not for the other parts of the venue.
Security staff queried the need for me to attend the booking office and were happy for the person using the rollator to wait and not walk the extra distance - very much appreciated.
Dropped half a point due to access (see below).
The visit was to a seated concert - not all events are equal as you will see from the other reviews.

"
1935,There is some disabled parking available at the harbour.
1936,"Accessible toilet was good, it's located on the ground floor. The red cord was tied up though (which I untied)."
1937,The venue is flat throughout with no steps or ramps.
1938,Disabled Toilet at the entrance of Marina building which doubles as a tourist information.
1939,"The Attic is on the seafront in Southend. Not far from the old gasworks car park, and good but pay as you use parking bays to the front of the Cafe ( you can get an app for your device so you can top-up payments and the app sends you text messages reminders when your paid time is going to run out ). 

The Cafe is light and airy, with tables down one side and a sofa and chairs on the right as you enter. Lots of space for a wheelchair, and a good accessible loo to the back of the Cafe. Very helpful and friendly staff, but not over the top. The range of hot drinks, soft drinks, and food is very good. The Cafe is used by various local groups to hold meetings due to its good access and helpful staff. Be it Scope, or a learning disability monthly hub meeting. Well worth a visit, and say hi to Kath, she is the boss lady."
1940,changing places!!
1941,Large accessible loo.  Ask staff to open.
1942,There are no steps to the premises. It is an automatic door to enter. There is an internal lift. As there is plenty of meeting rooms they will find one with space to accommodate you. There is a café with plenty of room.
1943,"Delicious Steaks in a roomy, accessible venue."
1944,"This is where the 'bad' bit comes in. From the ground floor access is made to the loo upstairs via a lift. It tends to be mucky inside and out. The accessible female toilet is at the dear end of the ladies toilet - that's not a problem, personally, but despite the sink inside and soap (if it's a good day!) there is no hand-drying facility available."
1945,The disabled access is suitable for those who are disabled as there are ramps into every entrance at the train station and whilst getting on and off the train there is portable ramps available.
1946,"Friendly, local staff. Never had anyone question me for not looking disabled when I have purchased a disabled ticket or requested a seat reservation."
1947,"A visit to the home of Racing 92 for the Champions Cup game V Munster, my second visit to the La Défense Arena & yet again it did not disappoint, a quality display of Rugby and an accessible delight it’s a must visit for any Rugby fan!   "
1948,Lovely venue once inside.  A few difficulties but in general a lovely experience.
1949,Access was level throughout although the flooring slightly uneven with cobblestones as it is part of old stables.
1950,"It’s quite a way from reception along a passage to reach the disabled toilet (photo 16) and you will find its door just slightly wider than normal (photo 17) but inside it is
Just a small room, beautifully tiled, with modern facilities, and grab rail. You may not get a chair in there though.
"
1951,Mostly flat some hills but fine for mobility scooter users. Lots of disabled toilets around.
1952,"There is good access to the country park and cafe. It would be difficult for wheelchair users to mobilise around all of the children’s play area as it is on different levels which aren’t easily navigated. 

There are dirt, gravel, grass and tarmac tracks around various parts of the country park. There are benches frequently placed around the country park should someone need to stop and take a break. There is also an interesting sensory garden to visit. 

No alternative formats were available such as Braille, induction loop etc. "
1953,"Excellent disabled rooms: wide doors, bilateral supports on toilet and shower, alarm cords reaching floor - spoiled by absurdly small wash-basin.
Plus: good food; friendly, helpful staff; good value."
1954,"Automatic doors to enter, we generally use the Rose street entrance as it is good for access to the lifts. Aisles can be too close together and it can be very busy, which can slow progress down!"
1955,Disabled toilets down both corridors were both easy to find due to lit signage. Large inside with emergency pull cord and grab rails.
1956,Highly accessible garden centre with excellent amenities
1957,"The access around the centre is great, absolutely no problem although it may be different at the weekend."
1958,Single 3 inch step into the venue. Once inside everything was level and there was space to move.
1959,"As our experience was for people who have a sight loss, the signage was not of great significance. The hall provides group visits and the guides are trained to assist VI people in locating facilities when required."
1960,Friendly helpful and well knowledge
1961,"I visited Boston Tea party on a Friday morning at 9am for breakfast and the restaurant wasn't too busy. The front entrance is wheelchair accessible, there is another entrance at the side, but this has one step. On entering, the tables are spaced quite closely together, with only just enough space for a wheelchair to pass by. The tables and chairs are not fixed in place so could be adjusted. It is an 'order at the bar' kind of place, there are no steps to the serving area and staff were friendly. There is a disabled access toilet. "
1962,This is a lovely hotel which is recently refurbished. Sadly a number of accessibility features are a bit problematic. The hotel responded very well to my feedback and maybe some of these might be ironed out.
1963,"Only parking available is in the adjoining streets, via blue badge but patrons should be aware of residents parking, and the neighbouring Lyceum Theatre.  Buses are plentiful on the nearby Lothian Road."
1964,Just request special assistance and you are directed to a lane which ensures ready access to the lift
1965,There's an accessible toilet at the end of the platform.
1966,It was a very accessible visit to the shopping centre and to get around. 
1967,Getting on board is done through an old guards van. I watched the elderly volunteer staff closely with a 21 century ramp on a 20 century carriage but it worked and I felt safe.  Despite being told in advance that I would remain in the guards van (with small windows) my powered wheelchair could enter a normal carriage and enjoy the scenery through far larger windows. 
1968,"I tried the accessible loo in the John Hope Gateway. It was spacious, clean and large enough for my fairly large powerchair. Another accessible is by the East Gate Cafe. This one required going through two doors to access; which other visitors held open.  Very spacious and room for a carer."
1969,"Small, accessible cafe-restaurant in the centre of Dawlish, with accessible toilet. Serves lovely food."
1970,"There is a good accessible toilet but it has a major flaw: the red emergency cord ends well over a metre above the ground. This is useless for the very situations it's designed for, namely when someone doing the precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet falls to the floor and is injured. The cord should reach all the way to the floor. Astonishing that, in a museum where accessibility has been thought through so well, this detail has been messed up."
1971,"Into the building is by ramp and all areas are fully accessible for any mobility aid. There is large lift to each of the floors, the disabled toilets are fully and well provisioned, serviced and with the changing places provision. on each foor all the exhibit rooms and halls are on one level. There is induction loop, BSL provision Braille and large print directories available."
1972,"There is no parking. We arrived by tram. The tram & tram stop were easy to use, the tram staff were kind & helpful. The tram stop is a short distance from the tower. Please note that the accessible entrance is at the back of the building not at the front, that's the part that faces the prom, but it was level access & easy to find."
1973,"We stayed with Amanda and Dave for 5 days. We loved the fact that they cater so well for wheelchair users...level access in and around house, bathroom in Zebra room is very well designed, mirrors and dressing table are positioned perfectly. We will forever treasure the memory of the anniversary gift they gave us. We highly recommend them to wheelchair users! Their hospitality was excellent and we felt sad to leave..."
1974,good attentive service
1975,The area was well signed and they had a wide ramp
1976,"The accessible loo is easy to find,  and is clean but - usual story - it also doubles as a baby changing room, and as the venue is very popular with young mothers it can sometimes whiff a bit."
1977,"It’s just 3.5 miles out of Stratford apon Avon, and we parked to the right of entering property, with just two parking bays, but other bays available as well. "
1978,"All staff at the airport we come into contact with are friendly, polite and very helpful."
1979,Very helpful and friendly.
1980,All of the staff were really lovely and helpful although not intrusive unnecessarily.
1981,There is on street parking all the way along Chamber Street though it can be very busy. There are numerous buses that virtually pass the door.
1982,Straight faced but polite and efficient.
1983,This branch of Wetherspoons is located in the former ballroom of the grandiose Great Eastern Hotel attached directly to London Liverpool St Station. The interior is magnificent. It's a good place for a wheelchair user and the accessible toilet is good apart from a thoughtlessly-positioned waste-bin in the wheelchair transfer area.
1984,"Don't know about disabled parking (apparently you can reserve Blue Badge spots in Great College Street), but we walked down Whitehall from Charing Cross Station, and was pleasantly surprised by how relatively wheelchair friendly Whitehall is - lots of smooth dropped curbs and wide pavements. There are some nastier curbs getting round the south side of Trafalgar Square and over the top of Westminster Bridge was crowded, but overall pretty good. Westminster Underground is step free and right along from the visitors entrance."
1985,The train was great as it stopped at several stops on its journey with plenty of time to get off. It was hand for me to get to places that I wouldn't otherwise see or perhaps even find. I felt that it was good value for the seven euros that I paid.
1986,Flat access and everywhere is on the level and completely accessible 
1987,Disabled spaces are right outside the door
1988,"There's a good accessible toilet but its hidden away round by the entrance to the underground station, opposite the small WH Smith. It requires a RADAR key."
1989,"The shop is set over two floors, only the ground floor is wheelchair accessible. The access into the shop is level (there is a glass door), and the counter is on the right. The counter is fairly high up. The ground floor of the cafe is a strange shape! It gets quite narrow in one point and then opens up again into a bigger area. There is a range of seating both at tables and sofa/armchair seating."
1990,staff were generally happy to help and assist. 
1991,"The loo was spacious and reasonably clean, but be aware that it's in a restaurant and shop area near the car park rather than up at the house."
1992,Staff were very helpful and the information desk is a good starting point as they can help with large print guides and other access information.
1993,National Trust at its best
1994,"Clean and plenty of space, accessible loos need a radar key."
1995,"Very helpful and had a good grip of what was going on! 
Seemed to be well organised and clam."
1996,Aright but a bit cramped and out of the way
1997,"Toilets ok with grab rails, etc, but doors too heavy and difficult to use with rollator/walker."
1998,Family Italian restaurant.. Work.night out..Access easy with a bit of good chair manoouvering. Good height table for powerchair..Friendly staff but seemed so.put on.
1999,"Boats to Saint-Honorat leave regularly throughout the year from Vieux Port at Cannes. There is step free access and spaces for wheelchair users. The boat trip takes about 15 minutes but check the schedule for the last boat of the day and be mindful there is a gap in the schedule over the lunchtime. On route to the island there are impressive views of La Croisette and the French Riviera coastline.
Please note tickets for the ferry can be bought online or at the kiosk at Vieux Port, which is accessible via stairs, although there is a step free route to boarding the bus. I visited in early October  and was surprised at the length of the queue to buy or collect tickets for the boat ride. I was worried that I would miss my planned boat (they are only once every hour) but the boat waited until everyone who was travelling was aboard so it left a few minutes late. This was my experience so don't assume they will do that when you are wanting to travel so please arrive early.
On the Cannes side the ticket kiosk and boat are located through a car park, just off a road where buses go by."
2000,"Toilets were really good with plenty of space, clean and well equipped. There's a Changing Places toilet on level zero."
2001,"The cottages are of varying sizes, and all different in terms of the accommodation and facilities they offer. It's worth checking to find the one that meets your own needs. We stayed in Oak Cottage, which has step-free access throughout the ground floor, with two ground-floor bedrooms. One bedroom has a ceiling hoist with tracking leading into the en suite wet room. There is also a private patio which includes a hot tub with hoist available. Other accessibility aids are available on request, including electric profiling beds."
2002,Parking - think ithere were 3.
2003,Huge carpark with many disabled parking spaces close to the shops. Bus stops close by to connect to Stirling and Alloa. 
2004,There is a park in front of the main entrance and it's easy to get there eventually by train or bus. 
2005,"Considering the age of the building, the access was excellent."
2006,excellent – several disabled spaces near door with easy access entrance with automatic doors
2007,"It’s always a delight to arrive here passing through the gateway, and along well maintained grounds to reach a wonderful looking abbey. Disabled will love the easy parking here, two bays close to entrance, and if these are taken, you may park next to them anyway."
2008,"Plenty of room, very clean and everything within reach."
2009,The staff do try their best to assist you they often go out their way to help. The team in X-ray are superb they seen I was going to struggle to take my wife from MRI area to the disabled toilet as they put her in a MRI wheelchair and we had my wifes own chair with us. They happily wheeled her along for us as I brought our chair and bags along.
2010,"The Kinema is very facilitating to disabled customers; this has been proven by the access in and out of the building, the disabled toilets, the designated seating area in the sceens and the wide set doors throughout the building."
2011,"There is a fairly large car park, although there are relatively few blue badge spaces. However it is all level, with tarmac, and it would be possible to drop someone off near the toilets/cafe."
2012,"Fantastic arena, really good and very spacious."
2013,There is on street parking in the area for Blue Badge holders. There's also a DLR station that is accessible. Low floor buses also serve the area.
2014,Wonderful! Healthcare but not as you know it... Will be 5* when the bus stop is back after current building work finished...
2015,"From automated doors to a changing places toilet, couldn’t ask for more"
2016,"The hotel is well positioned being on the main thoroughfare of Princes Street. Unfortunately, access to get in requires negotiating a step, followed by several steps and then a lift."
2017,This accessible tearoom serves lovely lunches and light snacks. It's fairly level from the parking spaces that are situated right alongside.  There's an accessible loo round the back.  You may need to drive here as it's a bit out of the way.. However theres a bus stop only 20 from the main car park entrance so buses do come here. There's a gift shop on site (next door). The site is home to the art gallery but you can visit the tearoom and/or shop independent of the gallery.
2018,All polite and helpful.
2019,Great! Spacious lift at both ends and level access across the bridge. Really convenient way to cross the river!
2020,"Many venues have entrances with no steps, or small ramps have been installed to make them accessible to all.  The streets in the main square are relatively flat with many access points for wheelchairs."
2021,"Mixed feelings here, as notice of no pushchairs or prams allowed inside concerned us as to what to do about wheelchair, should we go in or follow their notice that wheelchairs should use side path if wanting to sit outside. It was a very nice day on our visit, so going along passage did not really matter, until it came time to go and order our own drinks from the bar, we did not see any staff coming around to take orders, or even to clean tables, so then had to face the problem of two high steps to  get inside, or take wheelchair all the way round again to main door to enter bar area. "
2022,"The disabled toilets were of average size and the red cords were hanging freely
It would be excellent to see a changing place toilet installed."
2023,Disabled parking outside entrance.  On bus route.
2024,"There are a few entrances depending if you want to enter the hotel or the restaurant. I believe all entrances have a ramp though. The restaurant and hotel entrances definitely have ramp access. Once inside the restaurant, we were greeted by the waitress who took us to our table, which was immediately to the side of the door. It was a cold night so we asked if we could sit someone else away from the door, but there are only a few tables on the lower section which are located near to the door. It wasn't a problem though as they already had heaters positioned next to our table. There are many more tables on the upper level with is accessed via a few steps. Where we were sitting inside the restaurant was quite spacious and we were next to the bar. There was also a large TV at the side of the bar, so I reckon it could be watched from anywhere in the restaurant. "
2025,Couldn't have been nicer. Great gin recommendations. Nothing was too much trouble (amending dishes etc). This birthday girl got a free glass of champagne and a Happy Birthday message written in her dessert!
2026,Any of the traffic we noticed were in fact  going on to the ferry however there is parking in the area. The train station is located next to the ferry terminal and the bus station area is about 10mins walk away.
2027,This liabrary has a wheel chair friendly entrance and wide isles for wheelchairs and other assistance items to have easy acsess
2028,There was a gentleman checking the loos for cleanliness when I was there.
2029,didn't use them
2030,Easy access to venue. Good range of disabled toilets. Choice of seats.  Extremely helpful staff.
2031,The Holiday Express Inn Dundee is well situated on Dock Street with the bonus  of a council run multi storey car park  in the adjacent Gellatly Street which has a bridge walkway taking one straight into the reception area.  Blue Badge holders are exempt from the reasonable charges.
2032,Easy to access the venue with automatic doors with push button to access. 
2033,"The staff were extremely helpful. I had booked our tickets for a 12pm time slot originally. I later decided that I would wanted to access the exhibition via a wheelchair. Although the website says ""If you wish to borrow one, please arrive at least 15 minutes ahead of your tour. We recommend that you attend with a companion who can assist you"", I decided to email them to make sure I would have access to a wheelchair when I visited. At this point I was told that they would have to move our time slot as the tour we were already booked on was full and as the wheelchair took up space we had to go on a less full tour, so we were changed to a 1.15pm slot on the same day. The staff could not have been more helpful in facilitating this but I'm not sure what would happen if we had just turned up as advertised 15 minutes earlier for our pre-booked slot without contacting them first. 
When we arrived a member of staff brought the wheelchair to me. The website recommends wheelchair users being accompanied by a companion and I found going through the exhibition it was my friends and myself who navigated me round the exhibition with the tour guide leading the way."
2034,"There are steps through the main door, but there is a separate access for wheelchair users."
2035,If your wheelchair bound I wouldn't bother trying to access any of the trails or tacks in the New Forest. They just aren't accessible Unless you have an all terrain 4/4 power chair  or are an athelete . While some are gravelled they are still uneven full of pot holes and often over grown and narrow .  If you have urgent toilet needs your find that next to non of the parking areas have facilities for anyone let alone wheelchair users.  I'm local to the NF and have visited many of the sites and gotten stuck often and been stranded until a passerby come that can help to make this worst most of the forest has no phone coverage.
2036,"The location is very rural, a small parking area situated across the road from venue. there is a 100-150 meter driveway to reach the cafe. No disabled parking any closer to the building"
2037,Accessible parking was available near the gate. It might be better to use taxis or a shuttle bus though as these stop directly outside the gate.
2038,Staff in general like to help you anywhere without any problem.
2039,Located at Morrison's on Wheatcroft Way
2040,"What made our visit were the staff who were friendly, knowledgeable and very welcoming from start to end. "
2041,There is plentiful parking in the multi-storey attached to Fountain Park and there are fantastic bus links.
2042,"The museum is situated in the renowned Anstruther Harbour, a short distance away from the famous chippy. It tells the story of the Scottish fishing industry, its boats, harbours and communities. It is quite deceptive from the outside as it doesn’t look very big but it has an amazing number of galleries spread over several old buildings. Given the age of the buildings, they have done an amazing job on accessibility, with further improvements in the pipeline. Well worth a visit - and carers and accompanied children are free. "
2043, Great place to meet up for a drink or something to eat .  Wheelchair accessible  from pavement.  Nice beer garden for sunny days.  Indoors there is a large screen for essentialviewing of sport.  Staff are friendly and helpful .
2044,Sonja and Simon were really friendly and helpful and gave us a courtesy call on the first evening to make sure everything was ok.  They are only a phone call away if you need anything.
2045,Friendly staff and a well designed building for wheelchair access.
2046,"ccess was sometimes complicated with only one ramp access being available.  There are many gravel paths which could still look good if they had a silicone base. Ì found using my wheelchair frightening, but I had no alternative. Once indoors the place was perfect, spacious wooden floors and a real old country feel."
2047,Wide doorways with a good layout.
2048,You can park in the underground car park and come up in the lift. There's also a bus stop about 50m up from the centre. Omni is close to the tram stop in York Place and is around 500m distant.
2049,"Only one accessible toilet in each building.  The one I visited was step-free, roomy, with grab rails and sign posted from the cafe.  "
2050,The Gyle centre has accessible toilets in the main concourse.
2051,"Visited the first time in January, then again later in the year for the Van Gogh exhibition. We'll definitely be back, you can't see a place like this all in one visit. If Van Gogh was anything to go by, the special exhibitions will be well worth going back for too."
2052,"The accessible toilet is just outside of the restaurant in the hotel (with the other toilets), it's spacious, clean and has grab rails."
2053,"Arrived at 11.30 this morning 13.2.19 to find a very busy shop indeed arrived with a wheelchair and someone with sight problems.
1. No room to move at all very crowded place.
2.on asking about wheel chair we got asked if we could come back as there was no room.
I said okay but I need to use the rest room, what I saw there was a problem highlighted on here already alarm cord in toilets tied up out if reach.
Untangled it and took photos.
Needles to say we did not go back as it was so full of students we would never have got a seat."
2054,"Flat entrance from pavement. Staff greet on arrival, and couldnt be more helpful and genuinely nice people."
2055,Despite a very long wait for our meal the service was okay.
2056,"Very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff."
2057,"There are doors you need to push to enter which are difficult for anyone in a wheelchair or scooter. To order food there are 6 steps to the counter, although you can order your food via a touch button menu at the top of the steps. A member of staff will come to you if you cannot get to the counter though this is not ideal at busy periods as I witnessed someone waiting for 15 minutes before anyone came to assist them. The disabled toilet on the day we went was out of order, to reach the main toilets also requires going down the steps, past the counter then reached via more steps so not ideal."
2058,Check continually that all arrangements were made & have proof of email etc.
2059,Great. There are exterior tables as you approach (too cold at this time of year!). There is a glass door and level access on way in. It is spacious and there are different table set ups throughout.
2060,"Because it was wet, the tiled floor was treacherous on crutches. I went flying and was caught by my husband luckily. The flooring isn't non- slip so take extreme care. The location wasn't ideal - through a gate, outside, by a gulley - but I guess the owners have done their best with a very old building."
2061,"transport links are quite good as there are numerous buses that pass along the bridges eg. 5, 7, 35 etc. parking would be difficult though"
2062,Accessible toilets are available on site with level access. It is a unisex toliet. The door is 86 cm wide. There is an emergency alarm available. 
2063,Getting to Fort George is one of those adventures where you really need your own transport. You could get a bus to the nearby village but you’d be faced with a thirty minute walk along the narrow road to get to the Fort. 
2064,Staff were pleasant and helpful. I didn't need anything but I'm sure they would have obliged.
2065,bus then walk 
2066,Access is good ramps and steps with rails
2067,A wide door leads into the restaurant foyer where there is a gentle slope with a fairly tight turn to take you into the restaurant. Once inside there's plenty of space. The tables and chairs can be moved to accommodate wheelchair users. We arrived with two powerchairs in the group and had no problems.
2068,"All the staff were excellent. Peter walked round with us, pointing out birds and wildlife."
2069,"Large accessible toilet near the tearoom, not far from the entrance. Plenty of space for manoeuvring and for a carer. Grab rails."
2070,"So upset that I left. It’s dangerous, unsafe and degrading. "
2071,stewards on duty are very helpful to all disabled supporters they ensure you can get around with no difficulty and open the large accessible entry for disabled supporters to save any problems with turnstiles
2072,As before
2073,Level access to shop and throughout
2074,Staff helped with directions and moving chairs if required - happy to help.
2075,"The Iziko Museum is accessible from the parking area, with designated off-street disabled bays, to the ramped entrance and right throughout the museum, with all levels being accessible by ramps."
2076,For the disabled this restaurant is not ideally situated with the only parking space  in nearby municipal car parks about a ten minute walk. 
2077,"There is an accessible toilet but it was annoyingly disappointing. Rubbish bins were cluttering up the wheelchair transfer area, which is NOT free space for bins! Worse still, the red emergency cord had been tied up, drastically shortened, and tucked out of the way (see my pictures). This cord should always hang freely all the way to the floor. Very annoying - and putting people's safety at risk."
2078,"The entire restaurant is on the ground floor and has step free access. There are some free standing table and chairs outside and more inside.  The doors are manual, but opened when we arrived. There is a large glass counter with an impressive cake display, see photos."
2079,Accessible loos on each floor and good lift in between.
2080,Three carparks available. Use as much room as needed. Plenty of room for vehicle ramps out of the side or rear of vehicle. Use own transport.
2081,"All we met where very helpful, polite and willing to support us."
2082,"After tackling the doors, inside there is much space for manoeuvre  around the tables."
2083,It isn't really well designed for wheelchair users because of the amount unaccessible tables.  There isn't a lot of room to pass when wheelchair is parked at the table.
2084,I parked right outside it and the bust stop is a 2 minute walk
2085,"Confused as the food was 5 star but my experience was not.
I use crutches or a wheelchair and was so glad I was using my crutches. On arrival the   Table was not ready and we were told to take a seat at the bar - high stools not too suitable for the disabled. Table was ready and was down a flight of stairs.Once down (thankfully there we folk in our group to assist) I enquired as to the location of the disabled toilet and you’ve guessed it, it was up the stairs! Or I could use a normal cubicle.
Great meal, service and experience for the able bodied not so much for the disabled making me really confused."
2086,"Phone ahead to book a disabled parking space at the back. 
I use car but should be plenty buses up and down the bridges."
2087,"The first thing to be noticed when entering the ‘stable’ apartments is the huge, inviting bed.  High enough for wheelchair transfer and with ample space underneath to allow for hoist use, the bed is also positioned for wheelchair access at either side of it, perfect for a chair-using couple looking for a luxurious getaway.  Moving into the colour-schemed kitchen area, the cutlery and cooking equipment is all at accessible height, with space underneath the sink for a wheelchair or dining chair, aiding washing up in comfort! Communal gardens and flat pathways are wonderful."
2088,"Visited for our holiday during the week 23 - 30th July 2016. Loved it. Travelled with my elderly parents, partner and 2 children. My dad is a non step taking stroke victim who relies completely on a power wheelchair. The cottage is just wonderful, what I loved was the accommodation being over the 2 floors, with the disabled access bedroom and bathroom located on the ground floor and further living accommodation being on the first floor.  My dad made great use of the electric bed, which made putting him to bed easier, all entrances are level and doors are wider leaving plenty of room to get him around. I think Jane and Richard care about what service they are providing as a family, nothing was too much trouble and the finishing touches and attention to detail are lovely. It didn't feel like a disabled venue, the finishing was done to a  high level, beautiful kitchen and bathrooms, particularly the ground floor accessible bathroom. Gorgeous garden too, Highly recommended"
2089,A majority  of the walkways are slightly muddy and bumpy through the woods and around the ponds. Visitors in electric wheelchairs or even manual wheelchairs should be alright on the grounds. 
2090,They were very helpful and offered information.  Their cheerfulness added to the enjoyment of our visit.
2091,plenty of access in this store to get around and choose your candy
2092,Parking is available in the car park off Kings Stables Road.
2093,"Full marks for the staff from the people with the ramp to get off the train, through to the man greeting us when we came back for the return journey and the helpful guard who assisted our getting on to the train."
2094,There is a ramp up to the entrance. Entrance doors are wide but then there is a secondary barrier to get through which is automatic
2095,"Very nice. When I initially phoned to check accessibility, the lass seemed clued up and understood my needs and what I might want to know. The serving staff were lovely, unobtrusive and fast to respond when we called - there's a gadget on the table that you press to summon them!"
2096,This is situated in Exhibition Square in York and is easily accessed by car or bus . There is a car park on site and it is free. Disabled access is excellent with automatic doors and a lift to all floors. The staff are friendly and very helpful.
2097,Parking and public transport facilities are the same as for Derby Intu. The entrance to Eagle Market is a short walk from Derby Bus Station and the taxi rank. Shop Mobility is also attached to the Eagle Market.
2098,"The disabled toilet was combined with baby changing, hence a queue, although not modern there were grab rails ang the wheelchair did fit inside.  Apparently used to be the stables."
2099,"On street parking, but there's a few blue badge spaces on the road outside."
2100,"Level access from both street entrances and also level access from the train station. All doors have automatic doors, although it can be a little difficult to find the lifts. "
2101,"Warm, friendly welcome when we arrived. On seeing my crutch the lift and disabled accessible toilets were pointed out to me. Good service in the café. A friend was with me and carried the tray into the other room. Staff member took on board my comment about the emergency alarm in the toilet. Every time I have visited the staff have been very friendly and helpful."
2102,It's in the centre of the town so car parks not too far away.
2103,Staff very helpful when requesting disability room. They asked me would I require assistance in case of fire.
2104,"Basin could do with being closer to toilet, but possible good grab rails"
2105,The staff / volunteers were very welcoming and informative.
2106,"When we arrived, the parking was not well signposted, we didn’t see any disabled parking. Our friends told us there was and we discovered it near the front door, there are tiny placards on the fence but the whole row was used (not all by blue badge holders). "
2107,"The staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating, being well accustomed to wheelchair users among their clientele. "
2108,Visiting Aberdeen for the first time in some years the railway station was an unknown commodity.
2109,"There was a ramp to the front door, and a stairlift up to the top floor. Both the ground and upper floor had no steps and were easy to negotiate using the stairlift and my cane."
2110,John was awesome. Like our.own personal security 
2111,Certainly very friendly but service was a little slow and some staff seemed a bit inexperienced when we visited. 
2112,I recently started studying at Caledonian University. i have found it very inclusive. I have autism and before I started I took part in a summer induction programme. I was given a mentor to support me
2113,Browsing the Festival crowds on the Royal Mile I heard one of those performances where the sound simply draws you in to explore further.
2114,All the staff I met were fab. Very helpful and able to offer suggestions on the menu.
2115,2 small steps directly to front door.  However a ramp is available to the left of the door and which runs behind a pillar before reaching the door.
2116,"The staff were all friendly and helpful. My only negative is one male member of staff who we encountered several times. He was very friendly but made lots of assumptions. Suggested that 'one of the men [in our party] should push me up the ramps' and several times warned me to pace myself because it's a big place and I would get tired. He needs to realise that wheelchair users are not necessarily weak and helpless!

Everyone was great with my assistance dog. She got lots of fuss (which she loves) but they all asked first and were respectful."
2117,"We visited Chester's Fort because it is an English Heritage site and we are members. With hindsight, some of the other Hadrian's Wall attractions are probably better for wheelchair access. We had a lovely visit but I was very limited in what I could access."
2118,"Dogs are asked to be kept on a lead, but there is a fenced exercise park at the start of the trail if you want to exercise you assistance dog. Following the path ahead there is a level access, but small, shop selling ice cream, cold drinks, sweets and local art and crafts. There are also toilets and an accessible toilet in the building beside this. The walk itself is best done in good whether as it can get muddy in places, but generally access is fairly level. The loch is viewable at most parts around the trail, so you can decide how far you want to venture. I'd recommend speaking to the ranger at the start for information about the condition of the trail on the day you visit."
2119,"There is positive for wheelchair users alert staff to bring the ramp, however this was not working at the time I visited. Luckily I was with someone and when they alerted staff they are very happily brought the ramp for me to gain access."
2120,a morning engaging with farm animal with students from a specialist college in Lancaster
2121,great but you will need your radar key
2122,Good sized accessible loo on the cafe side on the ground floor. Not sure about elsewhere.
2123,"In the spirit of Disabled Access Day and #YouAndSomewhereNew I decided to make a trip out to somewhere I wouldn't normally consider. As a powerchair user my compatibility with flying is pretty low - I know it can be done but it isn't something that I would think too much about. I was interested in the airport and what it is doing for disabled travellers. And, whilst I don't fly (yet) I liked the idea of know how easy it was to get to, whether there are good loos and what is it like; after all I may want to go and greet folk flying in to visit me. It was pretty surprising how things have moved on since I last visited and the airport was all over the BBC local news for being a pretty appalling experience for many people."
2124,"The Apex City Hotel is a bright modern hotel set in the Grassmarket
area of the city. It faces directly on to the street and offers some great
views of street life and as well as the castle in the distance."
2125,"If in London, a nice wee place to see!

Leadenhall Market has been there since the 14th Century, and although the majority of the shops there are ones you can find on most high-streets, the building itself is worth having a look at.

As well as enjoying it's history and spotting building features of the past, Leadenhalls also been used as the backdrop for several films, so you might recognise bits of it!"
2126,"The waitress who served us was friendly and helpful and deserves the full five stars.

But two stars overall for staff, reflecting the management's appalling decision to provide such a dangerously short and steep ramp for the front door. Dreadfully negligent. "
2127,Vert good general service. Very off-hand about disabled access.
2128,There are many different entrances to the Cathedral. The main entrance has good ramped access. Once inside the Cathedral there are many side chapels to explore. There is also a shop for souvenirs and refreshments.
2129,The staff were fantastic. So friendly and very knowledgeable and passionate about the exhibits. A special mention must also go to the volunteer staff. The two ladies we encountered were so helpful and very friendly.
2130,"This old building has great access for a former submarine base and it has a fantastic, dramatic atmosphere; even if you don't go to the exhibitions inside, it's worth visiting to experience the dark, cellar-like submarine pens which still have German writing on the walls left over from the war.  They are doing it up just now though and I'm hope that people can still do this after the refurbishment. 
 This is my second visit to this centre; the last time was to an incredible street art exhibition which featured Banksy amongst others and this time I saw a former Magnum photographer's  exhibition of his seafront photos (Harry Gruyaert) paired with British film-maker John Akomfrah's immersive film on three simultaneous screens about our relationship with the sea over time with a post-colonial slant.  Both were really good but the film was absolutely outstanding; it said so much about our relationship with the planet and each other and covered lots of issues such as  whaling and slavery both past and present.  The setting was entirely appropriate."
2131,Decent sized accessible loo - it's just quite tight to get round to it.
2132,"There is ample parking in the streets surrounding the Royal Mile, I parked on Chambers Street next to the Museum. If you have difficulty walking, the street would not be ideal, but as I am in my power chair, I was able to zip up the road."
2133,"Very easy no step access from car to pool!
There is an excellent ramp into the pool. The depth of the pool is perfect for a wheelchair user. There are 4 very large changing rooms. It is a mixed gender changing room but all cubicles are perfectly suited and private.  Even the front desk has a dropped section to make it easy access to discuss with the pool staff."
2134,Browns is a lovely restaurant and bar situated by The Green in Angel. The food and cocktails are really tasty but can be a little pricey. Access is top-notch and the atmosphere is very relaxed so you often don't mind paying that little bit more for comfort.
2135,Decent accessible toilet. 
2136,"Parking is ok, but to access the front door, one needs to go by the busy main road. There is no lights, so same people had a bit of problem with that."
2137,"Great.  Fairly new building, so plenty of ramps, lifts and wide doors. Lovely stalls with seats removed, but stools available for carers - we had a great view"
2138,I did not use any toilets but they were all very well signposted.
2139,"This lovely shop is full of beautiful handmade products, made by local creators. The shop is accessed via a close on West Port, just off the high street. The owner is really friendly and happy to help."
2140,"Although a private car park close to entrance, it has too steep an approach to hotel entrance, and to many steps throughout the hotel. We did not find a lift. "
2141,"It is a high accessibility shop where you can find great, knowledgeable and really friendly staff. You can become a member of the community and have access to several services: use of mobility equipment, a sighted guide service and ‘partnership access’ to a service supporting people with hearing loss."
2142,"Flat, tarmac carpark with blue badge spaces. (Our Sat-nav went badly wrong in this area and their are road sign to warn drivers). You can get to it by car or steam railway but the car journey was quick enough from Bridgnorth. Entry is free with your rail ticket on that day."
2143,"The venue is on the first floor in the Angel Central shopping centre in Islington. On the night I went ticket holders were being checked on the ground floor entrance. On seeing I had a  walking stick one of the security staff took me up in the lift (rather than the stairs other punters were directed to) and got me a seat in a cordoned off area to the right of the stage. I hadn't made arrangements beforehand (expected to lean against a wall) so happy. Good view but if I had needed the toilet I would have had to get past the whole crowd to the back of venue (and we were right by the bar). The venue has detailed info about access arrangements on its website - there is also a lift accessible area on the mezzanine (balcony) level.
At the stage side we were right by the emergency exit."
2144,Parked in restaurant car pack. No specific disabled space but overflow car pack is just next to ramp access. Did not use public transport.
2145,Staff are usually pleasant and polite
2146,"Brilliant, especially at the café and the tills. Friendly and always smiling , very welcoming in the café . The manager waved me over to the accessible till as I approached to pay, and got someone to attend to me right away. 
"
2147,"I've always been a fan of Pink Floyd, one of the wealthiest bands that ever existed but always had strong artistic integrity!

I found the exhibition to be very accessible, with a few small flaws but I would strongly recommend it, fan or not."
2148,A reasonable size for a person who can stand but tight to point of being un-usable if on wheels. 
2149,"The distillery was built in 1798, and thus has very limited accessibility. 
The visitors centre,  bar, shop, warehouses and old filling centre are as accessible as possible in the circumstances. 
The staff are lovely, and like shooting the breeze"
2150,Good access once you get inside.
2151,Friendly and helpful - despite being rushed off their feet.  Service too was admirably quick.
2152,A beautiful garden and Edwardian Villa with a cafe/tea room in the heart of the city. A well thought out and detailed access statement is available on their website. Mobility scooters available to borrow for the beautiful gardens which have excellent paths suitable for scooters or wheelchairs. Some areas of the garden weren't suitable for the scooter but we didn't feel this prevented us enjoying the majority of it. The house was a bonus on a hot sunny day and we'll go back to give that more time.
2153,"Great build your own burgers. Good access to ground floor with accessible bathroom, no lift to downstairs area."
2154,didn't use toilets in the main part of hotel so can only comment on our bathroom!
2155,"We parked in Romaldkirk opposite the hotel. There's no parking near the start of the path (standing with hotel behind you, go right - cross the main road and head up the lane on the opposite side. The path start is about 3 minutes up the lane after the houses on the right). There's no car park in the village and no marked bays so park with care."
2156,as said before when barrier is down unable to get in
2157,"In town, so good public transport links, but unsure where would park for disabled bays. "
2158,"The toilet facilities are brilliant - so spacious, well equipped and comfortable. They are always so clean and stocked with baby wipes and cleaning products. They are great for any age so hopefully as my daughter grows, I can continue to take her to Touchbase and not worry about accidents/changing etc"
2159,Buses stop near Queen's University and there is some on street parking but unsure about restrictions.
2160,"The staff are always really friendly and they can never do enough to help you! Iv'e never had a problem with any of them, even now when I have to interact with them a bit more."
2161,Didn't come across any steps but there was one short incline  from the station up to the  main area which could be challenging for someone pushing a wheelchair.
2162,"The outer double doors were open and locked back into position when we arrived. The inner doors are automatic (push buttons at wheelchair user height both outside and inside). The one pair of internal double doors we encountered could also be pushed back into an open position. The circulating spaces in the shop, the exhibition areas and the cafe are very good. The lift is enormous, and we noted that the buttons had braille numbering on them. The lift reaches all the public levels of the building and there is plenty of manoeuvring space for wheelchair users approaching the lift and exiting from it. There are no intermediate steps on any level. The courtyard and garden are also wheelchair accessible. We weren't sure how accessible the building would be, so visited using the manual chair. We saw other visitors in power chairs and we shall use the power chair next time we come."
2163,Got a pass to come via my sons asn group. We couldn’t make the date  due to the weather and jasmine was amazing let us go later in the wk. My son didn’t really want to get out the car but eventually did. What a wonderful tranquil place to be. Beautiful animals. Wonderful owners and staff and whilst we weren’t there long we were made to feel so welcome it put us at ease which is great when u have a child with autism and learning disabilities- my son was able to be himself.  Bought some duck eggs mmmmm delicious defo recommend x x
2164,"This new hotel is close to Edinburgh Park Station which is served by rail and tram. It's a lovely hotel with a great restaurant, where the view at night is fun because of all the trams and trains. 

The staff are all exceptionally friendly and helpful. However, the automatic door into the hotel was not working when we arrived and it seems that this is a common malfunction. I can't recommend somewhere that I am not sure anyone needing that entrance can get into. 

You need to be aware that two of their accessible rooms have baths. In spite of being very clear about my requirements, I was allocated such a room. The staff tried to change the room and did their best to ameliorate the situation. When that was not possible we had complimentary dinner and a massive discount on our B&B rate. So they did all they could and we appreciated that. 

When discussing whether I would return, the manager gave me his card so that I could ensure an appropriate room next time. Why should it be so hard?"
2165,"Right outside Vauxhall train station, underground and bus station."
2166,"Apart from a small lip at the entrance, the access in this cafe is good. It's quiet inside, very spacious with lots of room between tables, bright from large windows, and it's table service."
2167,"Reasonably roomy disabled toilet, at the back and with space to manoeuvre, but with some form of obstruction in the transfer space. Clean and tidy and space for a carer. "
2168,Did not use
2169,When I arrived at the connecting departure gate I was taken into the Lufthansa lounge to wait for boarding. It was here I visited the accessible toilet which was huge and had all the essentials. 
2170,Decent size.
2171,"Vue Islington is one of a chain of cinemas. This branch is located in Angel Islington inside Angel Central, a small shopping centre. The cinema has 10 screens and shows the latest mainstream films. It's step free with accessible toilet.

At time of writing, February 2020, all online pre-purchased regular seats are £6.99. This is half the price you'd pay if you were in a West End cinema. Although you'd pay additional for the VIP seats."
2172,"Great access, automatic door from street, flexible seating, and accessible loo."
2173,Relatively frequent buses to the town centre during the day. Large car park two seconds away and parking on the road right outside with a blue badge
2174,"There are a limited number of disabled parking spaces (about 7). But the parking is only a short walk away from the centre. There is some gravel in the car park which may make it a little bit bumpy but it is not too difficult. At least not for a Powerchair.

"
2175,"Ramp into accessible toilet, shower fully equipped with handles and seat. Door opens outward, so help will be needed on way in."
2176,A wheelchair friendly resteraunt Pleasant helpful staff. Great toilet facilities with plenty rails to assist transfer if needed and room to manoeuvre. Small but very comfy eating area. Tasty food. I'll be back to try the ice cream.
2177,"I would not recommend doing the climb on your scooter or in a wheelchair. It’s steep with lots of cobbles and takes ages.

To avoid most of the cobble stones, a taxi is probably your best option. The streets are restricted to taxi and authorised people only it should be able to drop you immediately next to the viewpoint. There are still cobbles to overcome but they’re tightly packed.

You can take the bus from and back to the city centre (C31, C32 or C34). They´re accessible by ramp with a wheelchair parking area onboard. The driver may not speak English but they are usually very helpful. The ramp got stuck on the bus I took and he helped me to get the scooter and me off the bus without it. This was not expected so I think I was just really unlucky on that occasion. 

As access to roads up there are restricted, I don’t know how you would get close to park. I didn’t see any car parks on the way. "
2178,There are at least 4 disabled parking spaces very clearly marked.
2179,Disabled spaces on both levels of basement parking near lifts to store.
2180,"The railway station is a major transport hub, as well as trains, there is an accessible tube station serving several lines. There are also several bus routes that serve the station and stop outside the entrance or close by."
2181,"The East Riding Leisure Centre is a fun day out where individuals are able to socialise with others and enjoy the fantastic swimming area. Activity groups such as swimming and soft play are run throughout the day with professionals and volunteers there to assist when required. 
Facilities include; 
Disabled parking bays
Sign posted drop off points with automatic door entrance
Ramps with automatic door entrance
Wide stair way and pool hoist available for pool access
Moveable swimming pool floor to allow more shallow areas and space
Café with assisted service available
Accessible toilet and changing area with hoist if required
Lift access
Carers are not required to pay 
Public transport is available via bus"
2182,"As you enter the area, stick to the drive to the left, and follow it all the way round on right hand bends, which will take you behind the long building and round to the disabled parking area in front of cafe and toilets. It’s a downhill ride now to arrive at cafe, harder when you come back uphill later on. "
2183,"Staff were tremendous, very friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed."
2184,"Very Accessible Hotel, wheelchair Lift at front entrance, very good security and Lift access and accessible rooms"
2185,"We know it well, so we zoomed around all our favourites (otters, lorys, lemurs, tortoises) while stopping to feed all the critters we could. I use a powerchair, and find the paths wide and smooth enough to access easily. A couple of spots in the woodland gravel path may be slightly more challenging by manual wheelchair, but the vast majority is perfect."
2186,"Plenty of them, clean and meet minimum standards, but useless for us:  little one had to lie on the floor to be changed.  

But according to the Disabled Supporters Club, City are planning to install a Changing Places Toilet - which is fantastic news :) :) :)"
2187,views from the room window and extremely helpful staff especially concierges
2188,"There are toilets located across the corridor from Showcase VR and there is an accessible toilet. Within the accessible toilet there is not an emergency red cord which could be dangerous if someone falls and needs to call for assistance.

The accessible toilet itself is quite small so some wheelchair users may struggle, especially if they need someone to assist them. There was a wet floor sign in the toilet when I visit so, there wasn’t much room inside. The bin was positioned at the only transfer side of the toilet and was quite big so, I’d maybe suggest a smaller bin to accommodate more space for wheelchair users.

I think the closet Changing Places toilet is in the V&A Dundee."
2189,"Park in private drive, level access to house. If you don't want to drive and there are disabled people in the group, then I don't have any hesitation in recommending C & A taxis in Polis. They have minibuses with lifts in the back and passengers who can't leave their wheelchairs, are anchored to the floor. It costs approx. £140 for a return journey and takes 45 minutes from Paphos airport. When you have to leave your villa, they will collect your luggage and you can either go to C & A when you are ready, and their whole family is very welcoming."
2190,"The O2 Arena, London is very easily accessible and the local transport caters for those with disabilities such as having step-free access at all platforms at North Greenwich (the closest station), as well as lifts between platforms. The O2 Arena has disabled access parking in close proximity."
2191,This is a friendly cafe within Forres Community Centre with easy access for wheelchair users. Good quality food and drink (nice coffee!). The public library is in the same building with all the usual services on hand. A lot of care has been put into making this a good spot for all abilities. Definitely worth return visits - maybe for their Afternoon Tea package!
2192,"The bathroom in the room is large, laid out with thought, and as a wet room so everyone can stay clean."
2193,"Not too sure about how it would work visiting a tented ""village"" in a city garden square I was impressed by the thought given to accessibility."
2194,The food here is lovely. Views from the patio are stunning. Access to tearooms is via farm shop with a severe and very short ramp at the main door. I visited twice - once in a chair and once using a wheeled walker.
2195,"Large disabled toilet, ample room for carers to assist if required. "
2196,It doesn't have its own parking. We were lucky and got the last space outside on the street. However there is plenty of parking in the town's car parks which are only 5 minutes away.
2197,Very helpful and friendly. The man at the skate hire office helped getting people on and off the ice and were good banter!
2198,"Great location with outside seating, friendly helpful staff. Wheelchair accessible,  Dog friendly.  Fantastic scones."
2199,"The Big Red Barn was a great find and I should have stopped there sooner.   It is one of the few and perhaps the only really accessible restaurant between Abington (M74) and Edinburgh.
There is a very small lip to negotiate at the door.   Inside is bright and clean with plenty of room between tables.
The Big Red Barn is well worth an visit if you are traveling along the A702 between Abington and Edinburgh - 5 miles east of Biggar"
2200,"You can park right outside your lodge, which is tarmac surface for parking. I went by car so not sure about public transport though I do know that the bus services in Aberdeen are generally very good."
2201,"Large accessible lavatory with room for carer. Not signed at all. The loo is off one of the dining areas so worth mentioning when you get your table. 
Need radar key or ask staff."
2202,The toilet was one of the best I have seen.  There was enough room to turn my wheelchair round.  Very clean.
2203,"Polite and helpful, but you will need to understand basic Japanese as they do not speak English."
2204,Located near ASDA and McDonald's. 
2205,The staff were extremely helpful and immediately offered help reaching the top shelf etc.
2206,Plenty of on street parking.
2207,We parked in one of the parking bays outside
2208,An all round poor experience
2209,Extremely friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.
2210,Parking is good and easy although only 5 disabled spaces. Parking is close to the entrance on a tarmac surface. 
2211,friendly and welcoming
2212,A mix.  Individual security staff were very helpful.  But other staff were willfully ignorant.  
2213,"While visiting the beautiful city of Delft, see the last remaining delft blue pottery factory “De Porceleyne Fles”.  Dating from the 17th century, the tour is wheelchair accessible with fixed ramps along with ramps that can be placed if needed.  There is also an accessible toilet at the beginning of the tour.  Open daily (with the exception of Christmas and New Year’s), for the fee of 12.50 Euros, you can learn about its history and see firsthand how the iconic pottery is made.  The self-guided tour takes between one and two hours, and includes a headset to listen to the tour at your own pace."
2214,"Bus stop 500 yards
Disabled parking for rear and side exit"
2215,"The restaurant is on the upper floor of St Pancras International Station, so there's is a step free tube station at King's Cross next door and several buses that serve the area. Alternatively you could visit by Eurostar."
2216,It was the first day of the venture and the staff were great and apologetic for feeling they were not organised.  It was fine for us!
2217,"No accessible parking outside, near Trinity Luas stop"
2218,"Disabled toilets in Viking Centre very clean with plenty of room, it is shared with a baby changing facility."
2219,"I had to ask the steward for a key to open the disabled toilet (ICTFC should take note). When inside the toilets are HUGE, it had everything that I needed and it was nice to see a proper red cord. Although, you can see by the photo that the railings was covered in rust or something else (You make your own mind up) but I wasn't going to check."
2220,"City centre right next to the main bus route, disabled parking spaces available in Chambers street (10 mins walk away)"
2221,"apart from the door you do not have to ask for help, they will move furniture and offer any sort of help"
2222,Staff we spoke to were very friendly and did their best to help.
2223,Fully accessible with spacious bedrooms.
2224,There is a ramp leading up to the ticket office and the centre itself has wide flat paths. The only trouble we had was that the door was quite narrow and we struggled to get through but the staff were very helpful in this regard. 
2225,"I went to The Lodge Forest Visitor Centre for lunch followed by a stroll along the Waterfall Trail and up to the Red Squirrel Hide. I really enjoyed all the sculptures we spotted along the route, like the deer, the female figure and the mirrored silhouettes.
The cafe was spacious with a good selection including pies, baked potatoes and toasties. It is also a good place for watching people on the Go Ape ziplines! "
2226,"I visited on the second day of opening under COVID restrictions : I won’t go into all the details here, they are on the NGS website, but all people are required to wear masks, you must book ahead, you get an hour for your visit, and you are only visiting the ground floor rooms. I had no trouble with access, there were many helpful staff, the ramp was well designed, the gallery was largely empty, so I was able to see many more paintings than usual, and look at the smaller works for as long as I wanted. It is really a good opportunity to see these rooms, which do include some very famous renaissance and Scottish artists, without the usual crowds. Tickets are free. 

My only problem was with using the disabled loo, ordinarily I would have used the modern one on the lower ground floor, but this is closed off from access from the gallery. I visited with my scooter, which is very small, 52cm wide and 1m long. The door and corridor to the loo was really only wide enough for this, and while the scooter did fit inside the loo there was no room to turn around. The doors were very hard to open, but here the staff were very willing to help. My only negative was that not only was the emergency cord tied up, it had clearly been cut so it couldn’t drop to the floor. There is probably not much NGS can do about the size of the loo, but I did point the cord problem out to the staff (who very concerned and promised to fix it). 
"
2227,"As the museum is in the main stand where the hospitality  rooms, function suites and administration are located the toilets are fully andwell appointed with plenty space.
However if you are a spectator in the other stands, a totally different and disappointing story."
2228,A few disabled parking outside the front of store and 2  rows with about 6 slots either side. 
2229,"Staff were so friendly and helpful, helped retrieving my dinghy if Dad needed help.  Took time out to chat with me too. "
2230,Clean tidy and roomy
2231,"This historic restaurant is wheelchair accessible with amazingly helpful, accomodating staff. The Cock& Bull has recently expanded and now has rooms & on site cottage to stay in which are also accessible too! The food is great and I will deffinitely be returning. "
2232,"I attended this venue on the 8th of March 2022 with a companion who is confined to a wheelchair. On the door of the premises there is a round blue circle with a wheel chair inside circle press here for help it says. We did but we’re told that it’s not wheelchair accessible. So I pointed out the circle and said why that if not accessible. He said there’s no place to put a ramp and that was the end of that spoil the day completely I did complain to Costa I got offered a free drink.
"
2233,"This is one of the biggest toilets: its clean, I remember it having a hoist (although I've never used it). It's operated by radar key which, depending on your perspective, may or may not be a plus. I have never had any difficulty using it."
2234,Always tell me to take a seat and they'll bring the food over.  Very friendly and helpful.
2235,Pleasant enough.
2236,"Very clean and spacious.  hand rails, shower chair on wheels.  Wet room so plenty of room for carer to be in there for showering."
2237,This was the first time I had seen Test cricket outside Nottingham - and maybe we've been spoiled by the superb ammenities at Trent Bridge but one can see why Durham is losing its Test status.
2238,"The accessible toilet (you'll need your RADAR key, or staff will come and unlock it if you don't have one) is well-designed but the bin obstructs the wheelchair transfer area (see my picture below). Two stars lost for this obstruction."
2239,The staff are extremely helpful and welcoming.
2240,Parking is available in the adjacent car park. Lifts take you up into the station bridge walkway and another down to platform level. Buses stop at Waverley Steps and a lift takes you into the station.
2241,"Men's and Women's toilets have baby changing in them! Disabled toilet is huge and provides excellent manoeuvrability, but it does not require a RADAR key to access and it too has baby changing facilities. This means it is potentially open to abuse, it should also be noted that there is only a single disabled toilet at this main block. The toilet wasn't dirty as such, but it did need a good freshen up (this was at 10.15 am)."
2242,"I used my scooter to get from the town centre. There are nearby carparks, busses and taxis and a huge amount of useful information about getting there on their won website."
2243,Easy to get to loos turn left on entry to the store and  they are past some cosmetics. Cameron my son was appreciative but not half as much as me.  Quite basic but clean facilities
2244,I don’t think it’s on a bus route so I would say a car is essential and there’s ample parking space just outside for numerous cars.
2245,A friend suggested this as a great spot to have lunch whilst in Washington - and they were right! You overlook all the major sites (including the White House) and there's fabulous food too!
2246,"The car park is super flat, and there's a road sized space between stalls (they have to fit cars after all!). Stalls vary depending on what people bring to display their items, but most tables are at a nice low height. You may need to bend down to the ground to rummage for some things, however sellers are usually more than happy to show you what they've got to offer - then get ready to bargain for a good deal! 

There aren't many places to take shelter if the weather turns bad, so be prepared for this. There are refreshments available - burgers, coffees etc."
2247,"Long gently sloping ramp to entrance but uneven slabs making progress difficult for wheelchair. Inside lobby wheelchair lift to raise approx 3 feet to Restaurant. Assisted by reception staff whether I wanted it or not. When up to restaurant level gate opened and switch/lock mechanism fell off. When challenged, staff said it wasn't actually ""broken"" it had ""just fallen off"" and it had been like that for some time. It was then pushed back into place to prove that! It fell off again when going back down later.
Floors in restaurant flat but not level (it is a historic building)."
2248,"Good signage . Step free access to the site, shop and cafe. The doors are not automatic though, although they are wide. There is step free access to the ponds closest to the shop and the wading area. 

The paths are accessible for scooters and wheelchairs in this area, although not tarmac. There is a wave garden which is accessible but not at the beginning. You have to go right to the end to find the ramp. 

The large adventure park and soft play are both accessible and there are toilets including disabled ones."
2249,"Yorkshire Wildlife Park is an outdoor animal attraction great for all ages. The Park is home to many animals; which have large enclosures surrounded by paths offering an accessible view for all. The Lemur’s and wallaby’s enclosure is a walk through attraction, were the keepers give an informative talk about the animals at selected times. The park offers a multi-sensory experience by enabling the wallaby’s to be stroked. The park is accessible to all and has many facilities across the park."
2250,Loo is located at the car park near the children's play area and is accessible to wheelchairs. There are no facilities around the loch itself.
2251," Most of the staff are extremely helpful and obliging  especially those who helped get the wheelchair on and off  the trolley bus. 
 Unfortunately as usual there was one who was a little reluctant to help."
2252,"There is airport style security screening on entrance to the Museum. It can get busy but you can buy tickets in advance. The first part of your visit is a short film - there are accessible viewing areas in the auditorium. The museum is spread out over different floors but these are all accessible with decent sized elevators. You're able to get right next to many of the exhibits and the information is presented at a good height. There are audio guides to the Museum and you can access Large Print and Braille guides from the information point. There are subtitles on all videos, hearing loops available and I believe there are American Sign Language tours available."
2253,"The main entrance has six steps from the gift shop into the museum so access is via the large hanger door next to the entrance. Once inside, there is plenty of space to see vehicles in the hangers and look into the shop window displays. Some side rooms are either very tight on turning space or you have to enter forwards and go out backwards. One small area was up stairs. The cafe was up some stairs (see photo). There is one table at the bottom of the stairs and staff brought a menu and described the food available. I could see most exhibits and shop windows from a low height and the floor is smooth and flat. There are buttons to activate an audio description of some shops/history.  Outside is a picnic table with wheelchair access. There are no rope barriers between motor vehicles."
2254,"Probably no close by parking for main entrance in Steep Hill, but may be parking in Michaelsgate for back entrance.  We went by mobility scooter and walking from Castle Hill.  
WARNING:  Do NOT attempt to go UP Steep Hill from the bottom in either wheelchair (probably impossible and dangerous) or a mobility scooter.  We tried the next day, and my scooter died, which was very traumatic."
2255,The museum has good overall access. Founded in 1689 The Ashmolean is probably one of the oldest museums. It has a very diverse range of artefacts dating right back to 8000 BCE to the present day. And the exhibit I wanted to see most was Alfred's Jewel - a beautifully constructed jewel with small detailed work made in a time when savage wars were raging across the world. The Ashmolean offers an enjoyable day out with lots to learn and see. It also boasts good eating in the basement cafe to fine dining in the rooftop restaurant too!
2256,"Access for most of the route, approximately, 500 metres, is barrier free. The section in St. Mark's Park comprises a gravel pathway and does have a fairly steep slope upward as it comes into the main part of the park."
2257,"Everything in it. Its a bit tight but I manage to turn round in it.
As mentioned already it is at the end of a downward facing (albeit short) corridor."
2258,Excellent staff and very helpful! Just wish they would assist the toilet system a lot better
2259,Staff are very helpful and are always there to help you both at the station and on the train.
2260,Wide open doorway that requires no assistance.
2261,"A wonderful drive to get you to the hotel, and the car park is large enough with two disabled bays close to the front entrance."
2262,"We had a disables access seat at the back of the stalls, which gave an excellent view of the stage and we felt very' included' in the show."
2263,Very friendly and accommodating.
2264,"Professional, caring & compassionate to your needs."
2265,Level access using my mobility scooter.
2266,"Whole station can be accessed in  a wheelchair as there are lifts. I find the signage confusing and often end up back where you started. 

This station has a waiting room especially for those who need assistance. The room had  cushioned chairs and plenty of wheelchairs. "
2267,"The member of staff on the disabled seating floor was a bit snippy with my PA when she pulled her seat forward to be beside me, but apologised afterwards when we were coming out."
2268,This is a purpose built large ramp and also wheelchair signed lanes down to it.
2269,"The bathroom in the hotel room was huge!! Lots of space, shower/wet room with seat and grab rails, sink unit was lower down. The bathroom was stunning, its nice to see that accessible did not mean less luxurious!"
2270,Very pleasant and helpful willing to ask if you need assistance
2271,"Although rushed  off their feet, staff did their best to make our evening enjoyable..  Most had good English and helped with seats etc."
2272,There wasn't one area which you couldn't get into with the wheelchair which was great.
2273,"All efficient and friendly - no fuss, just got on with it. "
2274,Generally quite an easy and straight forward access - no hassle - for home AND away fans!
2275,"Helped with heavy doors at entrance, good at pointing the way."
2276,Very clean and accessible
2277,"This is a beautiful place for wheelchair users to visit, fully step-free and easy to get around, with lovely staff and loads of really good art. Strongly recommended. "
2278,All GDA staff angels. Excellent. Nothing a problem. Didn't meet centre staff
2279,Ground floor disabled bathrooms are very spacious. Bedrooms are very big and the wet rooms which are away from the bedrooms are roomy. This is a country house and not a nursing home. Just feels like home but the home is not a country house!
2280,Seating was limited. Outside tables would provide a resting place.  No signage or alternative formats. No stairs and accessible toilet on same floor.
2281,Allocated and well marked spaces with level access everywhere I went. disabled toilets and handles in the changing rooms for the pool and no problem taking my chair into the pool area.
2282,Have to get a key from member of staff but toilets are huge.
2283,"Good Access to get in, but no accessible loo. disabled shopping trolleys available. Could do with more staff."
2284,Two fully equipped accessible loos and a great changing places toilet with lots of room and all facilities. 
2285,I found everyone to be extra friendly here! Everyone working here seemed to be in a good mood too which added to the welcoming atmosphere.
2286,"Assistance from the train is pretty good. The staff are friendly and helpful. There is a taxi rank outside and buses also run from just outside. You can't access the tubes if you are a wheelchair user, but then they aren't great for wheelies anyway."
2287,"Access to the seats is pretty bad for those in chairs or  unsteady on their feet, with uneven  ground the main obstacle."
2288,"The staff were friendly, helpful and slightly apologetic. They didn't judge me for my disability or my dietary needs. "
2289,This review is specifically for the path from the forest car park to the pond; as this location is primarily a forest trail for walkers and cyclists only some of it is accessible and anyway there are often steep inclines. The path to the pond area however is mostly flat with only one short section with an incline. This may be a problem for a manual wheelchair user with no assistance. The path surface is generally very good.
2290,I visited on the chapel's open day and the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. I asked one of them about attending an evening event and they responded very positively to the questions I had.
2291,Everything wheelchair accessible.
2292,Clean and spacious
2293,Always found them to be very friendly.
2294,"The loo was fine, plenty of room and clean enough. However there were really long queues of disabled people at peak times which may mean they need to have a few more. I liked that they use the radar key scheme. The toilets were not abused here either which was great. "
2295,"St Pancras Old Church is a lovely, tiny church that is used for the usual church activities as well as small intimate concerts on occasion."
2296,"There is a large car park with spaces for blue badge holders.
There is a bus stop within 10 minutes' walk, but no tram stops."
2297,The staff are very attentive. They explained what some of the dishes are and how they're cooked.
2298,Two disabled bays in the car park but it does get busy at peak times so get there early if you're going by car. Practically zero public transport as far as I can tell so book a taxi if you don't want to drive.
2299,"Bus stop nearby but the buses are hourly and irregular. Recommend you visit by car
Large flat and smooth car park. Designated blue badge parking (free) plus electric car charging point.
"
2300,"The boundaries and hindrances have been removed in Flat Spaces.
Everything is made with disabilities in mind."
2301,"The bathroom in the apartment worked for me. There was a shower which you needed to step over the runner of the shower door to get in, see photo. I brought my own non slip bath mat, but I found it quite hard to get it to stick to the tiles, as I couldn't bend over and stick it down, so I ended up with my flip flops on in the shower and that was fine for me. There was a regular toilet but it was between the washing machine worktop and the door so I had something to grab onto both sides to help me with my transfers. "
2302,Excellent. Went out of their way to help us in a very straightforward way. We felt very welcome.
2303,"This branch of Maplin is on two levels, ground floor and basement. There is a staircase to the basement, but no lift. So half the shop is inaccessible to wheelchairs. For this reason my overall rating is half of five stars. If you want stuff from the basement, staff are reasonably happy to fetch it for you, but this is not ideal, and nothing as good as browsing for what you want, or might want, or might discover unexpectedly."
2304,"On arrival there was no disabled parking though spaces are wide enough if you choose the end of a row. The ramp is far from the entrance and can be blocked by vehicles. The acces route is narrow but passible if no one comes the other way. Top of the ramp to entrance required extra caution as it was un even. Ramp very steep. Door light but vestibule narrow and inner door awkward. Plenty room within unless particularly busy. Toilet roomy and well maintained, radar key accessible, available from friendly staff if needs be. "
2305,"On entering this restaurant, there is a piece of paper stuck in the window (not very clearly disabled unless you look for it!) explaining that there are no disabled facilities such as a disabled toilet available. It also states that there is another Pizza Hut with these facilities 200 yards away. 
On the restaurants website it says they have disabled facilities but then on another page it states 'Level access but due to difficulties with this restaurant we are unable to provide a WC facility for the disabled.'
There are braille and large print menus available on request."
2306,The toilets were quite small so not ideal if you wanted a wheelchair and a carer in there but we did manage. 
2307,They all had grab handles in the ones I used in the room and changing area for the pool
2308,"A wonderful large wet room with plenty of space around the toilet.  Grab rails on both sides of the toilet, and a sink basin that could be adjusted up or down to suit the height needs of the user.  Very clean and tidy."
2309,"Parking is right by the lodge, but isn't flat so we kept having to use the flat parking areas to do wheelchair transfers and hoisting. Doesn't leave a lot of space by the car to get onto the ramp"
2310,"There were several accessible toilets, these were next to the other toilets, and had the same decor. 

The toilet was large enough to manoeuvre a wheelchair/ have carers. 
The toilet had a full length mirror on the door - something which is often missed in accessible toilets."
2311,"I attended the Tom Jones concert in Princess Street Gardens with my friend who is on crutches as she has a back condition and is registered as disabled. We were told that we had to enter by King's Stable Road-which was easy enough then told that the raised viewing point for people with disabilities was passed the new fountain then follow the people who were telling us were to go, we then had to walk up a big hill which took us level with Princess Street, once we managed to get my friend to walk up the hill we found the seating area (two rows on a barriered platform) we gave our names and sat down, on the tickets it said that their was waiter service, as no staff were around other than the ones taking the names,we had to then walk back down another hill so that my friend could see what food and drinks was available!! During the concert the people who has been taking the names and putting the wrist bands on at the entrance then came up onto the platform and were dancing and basically blocking everyone's view which was very annoying as once one person stood up to watch most people done the same-not much cope when you are in a wheelchair or have limited mobility.  When the concert finish we got up to go and were told that we couldn't leave this area for at least 15 mins so that everyone else (well over a thousand people) could leave, I explained that my friends daughter would be waiting on us and was sternly told we were not getting passed the barrier!! When we were eventually herded out like cattle we could not get back down the hill to Kings Stable as there was still people trying to get out so we had to exit via The Mound. Total shambles both on the disabled access and the organising and customer service of the staff and stewards."
2312,Hand rails and wide doors
2313,"Fabulous, couldn’t have been more friendly or helpful."
2314,Very good disabled parking but not many places so if it was busy you may struggle to get close enough.
2315,"Went with a big group of us including 3 powerchair users - staff very friendly - able to move furniture around to suit our needs - good atmosphere and, very importantly, delicious crepes!"
2316,The loo is some 400 yards away. Mylor gives you a code. There is a wheelchair accessible shower and loo in the same room - it was clean and had good griprails for the loo. (Didn't use the shower so can't comment). Best to visit beforehand as obviously a small boat has no facilities.
2317,It's really good but the lift isn't big enough for a few people to get in with the wheelchair!
2318,"This is a very large 24 hour Tesco inside Falkirk's central retail park. Access overall is good, and the supermarket is close to public transport and plenty of accessible parking spaces."
2319,"The port staff are generally sullen and if there is mis-communication between the booking clerk and the lane staff at embarkation, then it is considered to be the customers fault (I have been told 'well I'll believe you THIS time' and 'You must have got it wrong' on 2 occasions when my request for a wheelchair space has not been relayed to the embarkation crew.) This is on both sides of the Solent but more likely to happen at the Portsmouth terminal.
On board staff are generally good and are helpful if asked to assist."
2320,"Staff were exceptional. 

Prior to visiting I emailed St Pauls regarding using the accessible entrance for the event. I had a prompt and very postive email exchange with Natasha Johnson, who made the arrangements for me to use the lift and was proactive in suggesting reserving a seat for me (the event was ticketed but with no reserve seating).

When I arrived I was welcomed by Dawn at the accessible entrance and escorted in the lift to the main floor of the cathedral. I was then accompanied by another member of staff to my seat, sorry I can't remember their name. They had reserved me seats in the front row of the second block from the front, with a marvellous view. When we arrived there was someone else sitting in the seats that had been reserved for me. The member of staff spoke to the person sitting there and asked them to move, which they did. When they stood up I could see that there were notices on both chairs saying they were reserved.

At the end of the performance I made my way to the lift and Dawn escorted me down to the exit."
2321,"Again only low marks for disabled facilities, as it was hard work to get us both into the bar. It’s on the level, but not easy, rough paving, difficult door to pull, narrow entry, but a truly nice looking pub and restaurant. There are steps to get you up into restaurant, disappointing, as it’s a delightful place. Of course, there’s lots of seating in the bar, and outside on warm sunny days."
2322,"Rustique is a really nice restaurant, it has a flat entry, but has two steps once you get into the restaurant. There are railings either side. It has seating on that level and seating upstairs. It is spacious. Toilets are downstairs again, but only down 8-10 is stairs with railings on both sides. It is only about 20 meters from a car park, which is good. "
2323,"Nice wide spaces, lots of seating, good signage and bright environment. Some of the shops are little cramped and crowded, but the overall experience is good. "
2324,The parking was very very good we could  park outside the hotel and take my stuff out the car
2325,"It is easy to get to the top floor and if you are lucky enough to be seated by the window-what a view!
The only thing that I struggled with was the accessible toilet. I only tried the one on the top floor and it was tiny and angular."
2326,"Duquesne  has a ramped entrance a bit steeper than in the UK ,so depending on your arm strength you might need he'll. Santa Eularia has a commitment to be fully accessible. At least 90% of streets have dropped curbs."
2327,We couldn't find the disabled parking. Info for the olympic park is bad. We ended up parking in a residential but which had reasonable access
2328,A well set out museum with great access and other features for disabled people. 
2329,There is one disabled toilet and this is towards the back of the restaurant by the other toilets. The toilet had reasonable manoeuvrable space but you might struggle in a very large wheelchair. There were grab rails available. The disabled toilet was clean and tidy and checked regularly. The pull cord went to the floor. It was also the location for baby changing but there are no adult changing facilities available. 
2330,Staff are fabulous
2331,"I love this hotel for a lot of reasons, not least of which is the support I receive as a disabled person.  To provide examples:

I am prone to falls and fell in the bar on 18th November (and I'd only had one drink, honest).  The female bartender, helped by fellow guests, untangled me from my rollator and got me on my feet.  I felt embarrassed and was really appreciative that no major fuss was made.

I have a toilet seat raiser for the loo in my room and two mattresses, one on top of the other, as the bed is otherwise too low.

Staff in the dining room help by carrying dishes to the table for me.  The main entrance to the dining room is up 2 steps but these are avoidable by entering through the bar via a lift to the rear of the restaurant.  I have learnt arrive smartly in order to obtain a table where my rollator isn't in anyone's way and which is close to the food servery.

Unfortunately, the hotel may be less than suitable for wheelchair users as the food is buffet service and there is no room for a wheelchair user to help themselves to whatever takes their fancy.  (It is possible a waiter may help, as happened with me on one occasion when the dining room was crowded;.  As already noted, the staff are helpful.
"
2332,We travelled by car and parked in the disabled bays. There's a ramp to get up to the pavement then a long ramp round the corner to get down to the entrance.
2333,Very friendly and helpful.
2334,"Friendly welcome with a smile from reception staff despite obvious busy times. Restaurant staff business-like and pleasant, moving chairs  to allow access to tables at rear of restaurant. Cleaning staff encountered perchance on the way to the toilet what extremely friendly and helpful, ensuring toilet doors opened and access unfettered"
2335,Not great on Sunday usually very good.  Got very poor directions from Wagammas staff that resulted in us Going on a wild goose chase around Bx when I got home.  I phoned the manager of Wagammas and apparently there was a lift working but we were wrongly advised.  I got very assertive in end we were offered a free meal.  The manager asked that we phoned up in advance to arrange it with him.  I will and we will check if the lifts are working!!!!
2336,"The station is large so if you're mobility impaired you may struggle. 

There were ramps available for the trains and also lifts. 

There was seating at regular intervals around the station. There were also transport wheelchairs available. 

Train time displays were high up and were orange light up text. The print wasn't large. Some of the signs had larger print than others usually white bold print on a dark blue background. 

Platforms 13/14 didn't appear to have tactile paving at the platform edge. Other platforms had the tactile paving. "
2337,"roomy and with good disabled friendly locks which don't challenge my weak hands when on my own! Easy positioning to get in and out, except in roof top restaurant where turning in an out of is is a little tight."
2338,There are 2 disabled spaces adjacent to the priory near the cafe. A ramp leads into the priory itself. The disabled toilet is elsewhere in a courtyard leading to the Buddhist Temple.
2339,Everyone I met during the visit was friendly and helpful.
2340,Not very helpful.
2341,Entrance is OK if not busy but the rest of it needs a rethink 
2342,"Lovely location overlooking Marina, good food but loo inaccessible by powerchair."
2343,"This beautiful hidden garden was created by two doctors on the lower slopes of Arthur's Seat beside Duddingston Loch. The very nature of the garden does make it quite tricky to access, however the owners have worked to make it as accessible as possible by fitting an accessible toilet with doors to the cafe and straight outside."
2344,"Way in level (not withstanding uneven paving on route from car park).  Lifts to all floors.  I recall seating on all levels.  Plenty of helpful staff everywhere.  Nice smooth floors inside.   Like lots of venues, doors inside were heavy and difficult to open but helpful staff to assist. Internal doors are my bugbear, hence star removed! External doors automatic/push button."
2345,The venue is small and difficult to negotiate but it is accessible to powerwheelchair users and those with mobility issues. Staff were helpful and friendly. 
2346,"Dobbies is not just a garden centre, it also has a gift shop and restaurant as well as a food hall selling local produce. Breakfasts seem to be a hit or somewhere to pop in for a coffee after a browse. There is much to see in this shop with a vast range of stock and it is an enjoyable experience with its spacious store. Something for everyone, worth a visit!"
2347,"Access is via electric automatic doors. There is lots of clear floor space and there is seating (hard wooden seats).

There is a lowered counter for looking through the catalogue which also has a lowered online computer which has the catalogue and allows you to pay for reservations using chip & pin or contactless.

There is a lowered counter at the main checkout. I didn't see a designated lowered section at the collection area but it wasn't too high. 

The lights were bright. I didn't notice any large print or braille. There was a hearing loop sign at the checkout."
2348,"Easily accessible for wheelchairs due to smooth ramp at the entrance with railings, however, the aisles within the store are narrow and could cause difficult when maneuvering a wheelchair or mobility scooter."
2349,I travelled by powerchair but the 35 bus passes up and down Canongate. The street is on a hill. Parking situation unknown in this area.
2350,"Didn't book an accessible room but lifts were available although not the largest. Entrance on first floor, there is a ramp but rather steep."
2351,"There's something for everyone here - furniture, glass, two reconstructed period rooms, weapons,  armour and paintings. The temporary exhibitions were very good as well. Everything is labeled in English as well as German."
2352,Staff were all incredible friendly and very helpful with everybody who had a visible disability.
2353,"There are two lots of toilets one on each level the toilets on the lower area are near the kitchen area I did not look at these. The toilets on the upper area are just past the bar area, There is one accessible toilet that is of the normal basic standard this was also the baby change area as well.  
The signage to the toilets is not good but the staff will be happy to show you the location"
2354,There were quite a number of staff on site. They were friendly and helpful.
2355,"On the flat, outside (so no height restrictions) of the main entrance to the Museum and around the side for Conference facilities."
2356,"Superb with a hoist and bed and shower,best toilets i've seen anywhere."
2357,Level entry from dropping off point outside hotel. Spacious corridors and lifts.
2358,Fine for powered chair
2359,"Having recently replaced the city centre Post Office in St James Centre at the East end of Princes Street, this new Post Office is excellent. It can be found on the upper level of the Princes Mall. You can access it via Princes Street (wheelchair access via the plaza next to Waverley Steps , getting the lift to upper level, or the other entrance is the ramp into Princes Mall on Waverley Bridge."
2360,"Most of the waiting staff are volunteers and are most helpful , cheery and very welcoming. Nothing is too much trouble to accommodate all disabilities, seen and unseen"
2361,Shame the door opens inwards. Was a little bit tight with the powerchair but would be fine for someone in a smaller wheelchair.
2362,"We use a wheelchair and the wide flat paths are excellent. Several different paths so you don't have to take the same route every time you go. The Helix connects with the Kelpies so how much you do and how far you go can be varied. Car parking is good, especially now the first car park has a better surface, but not enough disabled spaces. Accessible Toilets and cafes at the Lagoon and at the Kelpies visitor centre (although the cafe at the Lagoon is seasonal opening).  Only 2 real downsides for us: 1) access to the canal towpath is really steep and whilst just about possible with a lot of huffing and puffing by the pusher, it's not really that accessible which is a real shame as the canal path itself is great; 2) no chance to hire a mobility scooter which would be a real bonus. Very dog friendly."
2363,Access into the Square from adjoining roads is easy with level access and dropped kerbs. The surface is smooth and good for wheeling around.
2364,"I like this place, when I was self-employed, I used to come here a lot after the pool, as it had free wifi, it was generally quite cheap for a toast and a coffee. Plus it has loads of large tables that you could work on after the lunch hour rush.

The staff were always so nice and helpful and I go to know them quite well. "
2365,"We were given a Christmas present of a visit to the Abbey by my daughter, Kate. She arranged it all. She got in touch with the Abbey, parking was arranged at the front using blue badge, we were allowed to jump the queue as organised, meal was booked for 1PM. We managed to see the Abbey, the museum. After the meal we went to Evensong & were seated at the front. Abbey was laid out for Commonwealth Day on the Monday."
2366,"It was possible to get into the shop and get around some of the ground floor, but there is no lift to the basement and the staff don't seem to care about accessibility."
2367,"A lovely place where we often go for lunch in their fantastic restaurant. On leaving I needed to use the toilet and since I`d had a stroke 6 weeks ago, used the `disabled` one. On entering the main entrance to the toilet area was `mother and baby` and right down at the furthest point was the disabled one,  surely these would benefit from being the other way round?  Once inside the  rail that surely should fold down, didn`t,  so there was nothing to help me lower myself onto the loo which I felt was far too low down for any disabled users. I will think twice before visiting again ,  just in case I need to go. "
2368,There is street parking. 
2369,"As the route is primarily a walking route there are not many places to stop and rest. They have picnic benches and seated benches but they are few and far between. The ground is predominently flat, but with the nature of 'walks' there may be uneven surfaces at times. The river often floods in the area so sometimes the ground may be wet with traces of mud; there are always plenty of signs if the river has flooded or they are expecting heavy rainfall etc."
2370,We thought they would benefit from a second lift  as there is 4 stories of galleries and a basement cafe and library and today the one lift was being fixed. The toilets are also upstairs and in the basement so we really needed the lift
2371,Balmedie beach has a lovely small team of volunteers that hire out ( for free) various beach buggies and wheelchairs. There is a hoist and a change table etc. You have to call the number on their Facebook to book ( to make sure a team member is there to help you). They have 2 different sized hippocampe buggies and 3 other types. Something for everyone. Lovely to get into the beach with friends and family. 
2372,"The wetroom was well laid out with a raised toilet with supporting handrails.  It was nice to have a separated hand basin beside the toilet to avoid having to go over to the main basin.  Of which, there was lots of room around the main basin as well as a glass shelf to put things on.  
As I require a seat to use whilst at the hand basin, we requested one from the reception, which was supplied straight away.
The shower had a pull down seat and supporting handrails.  Easy to use controls made showering easy, although my wife thought I was daft when I described the water flow as being ‘lumpy’  by this, I meant that the water flow was somewhat variable and seemed to come out in lumps at times."
2373,"The automatic doors lead into the box office/foyer area and it's level.  It's a bit crowded when there's a performance and few seats or quiet corners to escape the crowd.  There's a cafe doing drinks, snacks and light meals however the counter is very high and inaccessible.   The main bar is upstairs so not accessible. The auditorium has a row of accessible seats in the stalls - the block of seats in row F that include F23 and F24 - these include two wheelchair spaces. These are on the level.  Beyond these there are steps.   To get to these seats you go outside to the Access door which opens automatically and lead so a gentle ramp.  The disabled loo is here too.  "
2374,"Very nice, helpful"
2375,"Tayto park is a wonderful family day for all ages and abilities. Situated about 30mins north of Dublin. The park has free entry for carer's and reduced entry fee for people with disabilities. There is a wheelchair swing, a petting farm, mini zoo, water canons, dinosaur walk and many more attractions suitable for people with disabilities. There is also lots of attractions for children 2 enjoy like a huge play park, trampolines and wall climbing. Then for teenagers and adults there r plenty of thrills in the rollercoasters. It's reasonably priced and u can purchase an all day wristband which gives u unlimited access 2 all the rides. There r plenty of eating places available, however, if going in a large group I'd advise 2 bring a picnic 2 keep the cost down. This can b a full fun day out for very little cost"
2376,It was a boon being able to park so close to the door and on a level surface with no hidden traps.
2377,"A slight step in but found out they can put a ramp down if needed and its only a small step so i easily went over it. Easy to manouver to the toilet, might be tricky if its busy but im sure they will accommodate if you let them know."
2378,"If on approach to Bluewater you follow the signs to the Mobility Parking area you will find a large flat parking zone with very easy access into Bluewater .

In fact you enter by the Mobility shop where there are scooters and wheelchairs available. 

You are now on the ground floor of the triangular shaped mall with plenty of lifts available to take you to the 1st floor ."
2379,The manager was very approachable and checked every morning to make sure everything was ok.
2380,Access was by ramps making everything easy to access. 
2381,There was only one member of staff and he was useless.
2382,"Parking is super easy there is a Car Park attached to Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre and there are dedicated Blue Badge spaces. If travelling by bus, loads of Lothian buses stop at Ocean Terminal and they are all wheelchair accessible."
2383,This venue has good access
2384,Six disabled spaces directly outside restaurant. Completely level access from car parking space to restaurant.
2385,"Initially I had emailed them but received no reply so I telephoned to reserve a table at their café before the performance. When we arrived there was a table with my name on the 1st floor and time of booking on it. When I ordered my food at the café the staff the staff were amazingly helpful and friendly. They were proactive when they saw my crutch, asked where I was sitting and said that they would take my tray of food up to my table. The waiter got up the stairs and had put the food on the table before I arrived back via the lift. At the interval the café was very busy and the staff served everyone very quickly. Again seeing my crutch they offered to carry my food but as my cake was in a box I didn't need help carrying it."
2386,Quite a few disabled parking bays but could have done with more 
2387,The toilets were easy to find and clean
2388,"Staff were ok but we did say that we found the hotel cold especially in the restaurant, bars and lounge area . radiator were not on much at all in these areas ,only one in the restaurant and one in the lounge. "
2389,Didn't park but the train service excellent
2390,Everytime we have visited the Pavilions all the staff have been incredibly helpful and very welcoming!
2391,Very helpful - provided us with a map and marked on it which parts wouldn't be accessible.
2392,"Level access throughout, flexibility of provision very good"
2393,"There is level access into the coffee shop by a lightweight, manual door, which is plenty wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. The floor is smooth wooden boards, making it very easy to traverse, and the tables both outside the shop and at the front of the shop are spaced apart allowing easy passage between furniture. The counter is lower than in most coffee shops, making it very easy to communicate with the baristas, and table service is provided for everyone.
 There is one raised area up some steps at the back of the coffee shop without a ramp, but plenty of accessible seating available so this shouldn’t be problematic.
 There is a disabled toilet, but this does not include full changing facilities.
 The staff and friendly and co-operative, and are willing to provide any support necessary.
 The coffee shop is near several bus stops and the train station, and multi-storey car parks with accessible parking are also available nearby.
"
2394,Reasonably easy to get about - pretty much level access
2395,"There are marked bays near the entrance but on busy days these might all get full, however there is plenty of space . You need to pre-book the scooters by ringing 01677 427203. "
2396,These toilets are located in the market place near Lloyds bank. The toilets are open from 8am to 5pm Monday to Saturday and 8am to 4.30pm on a Sunday.
2397,Brilliant I was able to hoist and change my 7 year old son with ease. Facilities  like these are few and far between.
2398,"Excellent staff and very helpful. Maybe because i was talking a little Thai, but they had very good English anyway."
2399,Overall very good. Lift on the small side to fit me and my husband and a case inside. Handy that the lift went straight up to the room floors without trundling equipment past reception and through lots of doors. Room had low twin beds which was our chosen preference. Nice moveable table by the bed for my ventilator and plenty of room for manual transfers. Possibly not big enough for a hoist. Flat access to the beefeater next door. No major noise and good air con. No heating.
2400,Staff were friendly and helpful
2401,"It is a little difficult to get parked close to the restaurant as it is on the Royal Mile, but I managed to get parked on Johnston Terrace. There are 2 disabled bays here, which are very handy."
2402,There is disabled parking right at the door
2403,"This beach is easy to drive to, and there are plenty of blue badge parking spaces. The parking area is set on concrete, so if you are in a wheelchair and you can't get one of these blue badge spaces, it is a clear, easy route to the beach."
2404,"Fully accessible changing places toilet accessed by RADAR key, although staff keep a spare at the customer services area near to the toilet.
Toilet has several handrails all in the right places 
Red alarm cord at required length
Clean and tidy 
Large and easily accessible by a wheelchair and more than one carer if necessary."
2405,It was easy to get everywhere - there is a lift
2406,"Nice wide doors throughout, with no thresholds. Doormat carpeting for length of vestibule ensures full tyre can be wiped."
2407,Very friendly and helpful. I was asked a lot if I was OK. 
2408,"excellent access to nearly all shops and attractions.  Very flat, a few cobbles but otherwise a good place to spend a day shopping and meeting up with friends."
2409,On street parking around George square which is directly opposite the venue. All on street parking is free with the blue badge. Walking distance from Queen Street station too which is handy.
2410,"There are two access points in to the retail park one is from Coatbank St the other is South Circular Road. The store is on its own on the Northern  side of the retail park.
Entrance to the store is via a wide door way this is open at both ends you then turn into the store.
There are trolley points located near the entrance these are coin operated using a £1.00 coin you get this back when you return the trolley.  
There is good signage in the store to tell you what is in each aisle"
2411,No problems accessing cottage and plenty of room to manoeuvre
2412,I am going to give four stars because of the effort and thought put into access by the Fair's organisers. Building platforms and access ramps on stilts was no mean feat. It did mean I could wheel around the whole show and see every stand which was great. The access down to the graveyard is outwith the Fair's control but they have made every effort to make it as easy as the terrain allows. Part of the Fair is at street level alongside the church and has been made accessible and this houses another twenty or so stands to see.
2413,Great shopping centre with lots of choice for stores to visit.
2414,"We suggest the main Touchwood car park, but a little costly, minimum of £2.50, or  have a cup of coffee at the Crowne Plaza, REGISTERING YOUR CAR AT RECEPTION DESK, and walk across through the gardens to Touchwood shops. Mind you, it is hard work for your carer this way, it’s uphill, round and round gardens with a huff and a puff on the way, but it’s cost free, well, not really because you have had to enjoy a decent cup of coffee at the hotel."
2415,"Whilst they are the same staff now working for a different operator, could not fault LNER staff, the info point staff for London Transport or those involved with the Underground. "
2416,"So is a wheelchair accessible cafe in the centre of Aberdeen. It had lovely food, helpful staff and an accessible loo. Well worth a try if you're in or around the area."
2417,"excellent, helpful"
2418,On a sunny Sunday afternoon the car park we used was full. There is a hard surface car park for around 45 cars but only a few reserved blue badge spaces with no safety markings to exit the vehicle. There is another car park entrance with a few spaces on the opposite side to the park (cafe side).
2419,"I cannot day enough good things about South Newlands Farm. This has been our sixth stay here. We travel from the USA  with varying numbers of kids with varying disabilities. (We adopt special needs kids) Rod and Peggy have been incredible over the years and really go the extra several miles to make our stay comfortable. It really is home from home for us. I am from the area so we come to visit family predominately so having somewhere to stay where family and friends can come and visit us is fantastic. As far as I am concerned, there is nowhere that meets the needs of the disabled community quite like here. "
2420,"There are three entrance to the garden, two with gravel underfoot and one with paving slabs (the entrance from Watergate). The garden itself is a mixture of paving slabs, gravel and grass. There are raised plant beds which is good for seeing the different plants in the garden. I also appreciate the fact that there were quite a few benches around the garden. I've not given it 5 stars as I know gravel is not the easiest for everyone to navigate."
2421,"Drove to the door. Bypassed long queue of other car drivers by waving blue badge. One disabled parking space had been saved for the person who had booked the tramper for that afternoon- me.  Had I not booked, there would have been no parking.  Steepish slope from car to visitor hut. Staff very friendly and welcoming."
2422,"Entrance is via a small, but slightly steep ramp to a double doorway. Once inside, there is level access throughout. Every room is a good size, particularly one of the bedrooms, and all have a red emergency chord in, although I found them all to be tied up out of the way. Maybe as this cottage is hired out to disabled and non-disabled alike. There is also visual alarms on the ceiling that light up in each room.
The kitchen, although spacious, is not particularly made any more accessible than standard kitchens. The bathroom is large with a roll in shower and a bath."
2423,Around if needed and friendly
2424,On street disabled parking around the venue is plentiful and easy to find.
2425,The toilets are located outside accessible via a slight ramp. The toilets are cabin style. The accessible toilet was a decent size and had grabs bars and an emergency cord (which was tied up). The position of the waste bin could possibly get in wheelchair users way and prevent being able to move around easily. 
2426,Staff here were ok and helpful
2427,Staff at the one stall I visited were helpful.
2428,"Good wide door, although might need help to open them if you're on your own. 
Corridor starts wide but gets narrower towards the back of the shop. You need to move a seat to get a space for a wheelchair."
2429,Access into the building is easy for wheelchairs
2430,"There is a level access entrance to each cottage. The spacious porch has electricity sockets for scooter charging. All internal doorways and corridors are extra wide. The open plan lounge/ kitchen/ dining area is spacious and the wooden floor makes moving around easy, especially in a manual wheelchair. A lower level breakfast bar means I can assist with food preparation. The accessible bedroom(s) has a single divan and a single profiling bed  with pressure relief mattress. A celling tracking hoist makes transfers easy."
2431,Entrance to the store is all flat and wide - no need for signage.
2432,"This is perhaps the only downside to visiting the Kelpies - parking can be difficult in summer months. They have overflow car parks etc. but as public transport in Falkirk really isn't great, the car parks are really quite important. Luckily, I visited in winter and there were plenty of spaces and ample accessible parking areas."
2433,"I'm a self-confessed John Lewis fan, but when I visited this store on a less mobile day I was astounded by how helpful the staff were. I've never used the restaurant before...it's great - spacious, filled with sunshine, fully accessible, and when the staff at the checkout spotted my walking stick they immediately offered assistance unprompted."
2434,What an amazing team.  Thanks for a warm and informative welcome.
2435,"This German bar has Level access. It has a good party atmosphere on the weekends, Good food, and friendly staff."
2436,"We arrived by car on a surprisingly busy Wednesday during holidays. The overflow parking on the way in was full; with cones to discourage drivers continuing to the main car park. 

The overflow parking appeared (and is) some distance from the Kelpies, so we took a chance and drove round the cones. The main car park was also full with an attendant operating a 1 in 1 out system. 

After a 20min wait we were sent round to the empty coach parking to give us more space for the wheelchair. They also waived the £2 charge (think overflow was free to all). Shame we had to wait but no biggie really."
2437,Top marks to all the staff. From the ticket lady who helped us  and explained the concessions through to the guys who helped us board the cabin and get off once the ride was over. It was all done in a seamless manner with no fuss. Fantastic job!
2438,"There are plenty of accessible parking spaces at the side of the Cineworld building which isn’t too far from the entrance. There are also a few accessibility parking spaces in front of the Cineworld building too, as well as many standard parking spaces.

I don’ know much about the public transport in this area of Dundee. However, there is a bus stop about a 5-minute walk away which goes from Blairgowrie to Dundee bus station. Then Dundee bus station is a 10-minute walk to Dundee train station.
"
2439,Good staff. Worth a visit 
2440,"There is a large number of staff employed in the centre however the staff my self and my wife spoke to were very helpful.
As we entered by the Sauchiehall St door we stopped to  read the information board with in a minute of doing so one of the security staff asked if we needed any help. A while latter the same security  noticed me trying to get my Radar key out of my pocket and opened the toilet for me ."
2441,Their is a disabiled toilet just outside of the main room what is really good 
2442,We arrived by car and the disabled parking was right at the entrance. It was ideal.
2443,"There is no admission charge for personal assistants, and Eden also have access volunteers on sight (however booking two weeks in advance is required) to help assist people in their visit. There is a hearing loop that visitors have access to at the main visitor’s centre on arrival (it’s on till number 13).  "
2444,"The gallery is all on ground floor level. There is a slight step up at the entrance, see photo. Once inside it is all step free. Please be mindful the gallery is small but well laid out with information boards and objects. There is a reconstruction of the flat's dressing room and kitchen. There is also small video room with stools without back support. I'm sorry I can't remember if the video was captioned. At one end there is a freestanding table and chair with back support and stools."
2445,Super friendly and helpful
2446,"Wow, firstly I never knew you could put lifts in a canal boat, I wasn't sure how we got on an it made things so much easier. a toilet big enough for a wheelchair too, plus there is still plenty of space to move around.  The crew were wonderful, nothing was too much trouble, they were such a good laugh and really made the day fun, they were a font of knowledge about the canal and the boats too.  I really can't wait for a return trip."
2447,"There was a council car park at the entrance to Norie Miller Park however, it was cornered off for the event. Therefore, we parked about a 5-minute walk away in a council car park. Around Perth there are a few council car parks near Norie Miller Park.

Within at least a 10-minute distance from the park there is a bus station and train station. I'm not sure about the local public transport because I am not from this area."
2448,"Parking at the lodge was excellent with no threshold to manoeuvre when using the back door. We used our own car during this visit. In general we found parking ok around the Lakes and Dales. Some of the pavements were difficult to negotiate mainly due to lack of ramps and vehicles parked on the pavements. However, this can be said for most places. One trip we would recommend for powered wheelchair/scooter users was Grisdale where there was a lovely path going around a lake."
2449,"There are dedicated blue badge bays at the West gate to the gardens.  No road to cross with lots of space for unloading wheelchairs, at the West Gate.  Regular buses at the East Gate, although this is a distance from the Gateway cafe.  There is another care at the East Gate, however I haven't been there."
2450,If you pick your time right you'll be fine getting (no radar key needed) and there is ample space to manoeuvre around.
2451, There is a bus stop outside the station but the route from that stop to the station entrance involves another incline. There is a good drop off point near the station taxi point which has level access and there are also 3 or 4 parking places for Wheelchair users but those spaces are constantly abused by able bodied people and parking time is limited anyway!  So I always use a taxi which drops me to catch my train and also collects me on return.
2452,"If you manage to get past the cobbles you're confronted with slightly uneven flagstones that do level out once you're inside. Inside is what you expect from a bar. No lowered surface so you need to perform the usual gymnastic routine to catch the bar staff's eye, or send your friends up. A mix of standing height tables and lower ones. You can manoeuvre ish if it's not too busy, but you're pretty much restricted to one spot or spend your entire night yelling 'excuse me'. One thing to note, a lot of the tables are made up of square tables to form a rectangle - they're too narrow to get your footplates underneath between the table legs. There are true rectanglular tables in the restaurant area worth scoping out if you can.

There's an upstairs area but I didn't spot a lift. "
2453,"There was a small lip at the entrance door, which was narrow and didn't open fully. My wheelchair just fitted through but it was very tight. The tables had large bases so I couldn't get my chair very close - I ended up transferring to one of their chairs to get close enough to eat comfortably."
2454,We travelled by private car.  There are some disabled spaces but they are not particularly wide.
2455,"Free disabled parking.

"
2456,Some on street parking is available if you have a Blue Badge. There's also some parking in the nearby Grassmarket area.
2457,No Blue Badge parking outside.  Venue is on the High Street and there is a 45 minute restriction.  Visitors will need to offload and find unrestricted parking.  We parked a short distance round the corner.  There is a bus stop right outside the venue.
2458,Gleneagles Station has a good ramp to station platform and lift to cross to other platform. There is an accessible loo and at least 4 disabled parking spaces.
2459,One disabled toilet but this was the only customer toilet for the cafe. 
2460,Very clean and spacious. Well signposted and and accessed via a smooth pavement.
2461,"This is a fantastic family day out! I love the film Brave and to see the music played by a live orchestra was incredible! 

The Royal Concert Hall is a great venue. The accessibile entrance is at the side of the building and has an automatic door. You then use a platform to access the main foyer. There are two accessible toilets. One is beside the cafe and is often used by everyone so becomes dirty quite quickly; the other is behind the door nearest the cloakroom at the bottom of the main foyer. Both toilets are quite small. 

There is lift access to the main hall from the main foyer and then different entrance doors acording to your seats The only disappointing thing is that the accessibile seats upstairs are restricted viewing which is difficult if you cannot transfer "
2462,"Entirely accessible, no special treatment for being disabled!"
2463,"I have been to a few events at the parliament, from an art exhibition to watching a debate in chamber and I have had no trouble moving about. There are lifts and toilets throughout and a cafe with delicious scones!"
2464,Route to cafe through shop could usefully be wider.
2465,"Checked the accessible loo in the lobby, it was clean and spacious. "
2466,The accessibile room has its own accessible toilet and there is a small accessible toilet in the reception area which is very restricted for space.
2467,A handy superstore if you've just arrived on holiday or are travelling out from the adjacent railway station.
2468, The staff were helpful.
2469,"Just a 3 star here - mixed. Access to the hotel and all downstairs features is great, the 'accessible' room I had was just that, accessible, not a wheelchair room"
2470,Have to ask inside for them to put the ramps out to get in the premises
2471,"Great Parking, easy paths for mobility scooter, wide smooth corridors. Wonderful ground floor accessible bedroom, with easy wet room.
Lift access to all areas we needed in to."
2472,There are two large steps to get in. A ramp is sitting at the door but my dad had to go inside and let staff know we had arrived so they could deploy the ramp. They didn’t put it down properly the first time so please take care when you come that everything is safe before attempting the ramp! Once inside it is level access but the areas are quite cramped. The path to the toilets goes up a small ramp or step. The ramp is winding and tight and I struggled to turn the corner without scraping the walls. Oopsy! You go up this ramp to go into the lift for Kyloe .. more about that is in the Kyloe review.
2473,Parking is limited outside but there's level access to the box office and cafe via automatic doors.  The accessible entrance to the auditorium is reached by going back outside (luckily it's covered should it be raining). There's an accessible loo just inside the second entrance. This is only unlocked for performances so I'm not sure how visitors to the cafe or restaurant would access the loo. It's a bit chaotic in the foyer area when there's a performance - difficult for a wheelchair user or someone with walking difficulties - there's limited seating in the foyer/cafe when it's crowded and everyone's concentrated in a small area.
2474,Building is easily accessed via side ramp on right hand side of building. Lifts are large in size and disabled toilets located on each floor. Limited Blue badge parking bays located outside student association building. 
2475,Very helpful and welcoming gave me info I was looking for and how I could find out more
2476,"They facilitated the transport of my scooter. When we got to our destination we were proved with a leaflet with a map of local attractions , we used to go St Catherine’s Church, a little gem."
2477,"Step free access to enter the prison but some areas would be inaccessible for wheelchairs. Only ever one step so might be suitable for others with mobility aids, but no hand rails for single steps. 
Signs are small print but lots of pictures and able to understand without the signs. "
2478,"The School House Coffee bear in Church Lane isn’t easy to find as it’s tucked behind the church, but I was so glad I found it.
Car park a bit gravelly but not loose or deep and I wheeled over easily.
There are tables and chairs outside or an easy ramp to get indoors. It’s an enormous old building so loads of space for wheelchairs.
They do tea coffee posh lemonades etc plus light bites cakes and scones and also lunches.
There was a folk singer at lunchtime ( but room to ignore him if you wanted!),
Had a lovely unhurried lunch and on the way out found a brilliant disabled loo too. Room for a big chair to manoeuvre easily and useful grab rails.
There was a dog in there with owner too, so obviously fine with that too.
Worth a visit if on holiday."
2479,"Good access with no steps or inclines. Suitable for wheelchairs, with an Easy Access route specifically designed for wheelchair users. 
Every Thursday morning a local charity offers for hire a range cycles adapted for use by people with a range of disabilities. 
"
2480,"there should be dedicated priority seating for disabled people! I booked tickets to a comedy show and emailing and filling in an online form didn't help, add I got ignored. yes no responses from their so called customer service. I I called and asked about disabled seating for the Billy Connolly show. I was asked ""can she transfer"" when asking about starting for my Mother - currently wheelchair bound. I am so appalled at this"
2481,Taxis can drop off and pick up right outside and (in theory) you can park there but I wouldn't bank on getting a space on George Street
2482,Not much contact with staff but helpful when required
2483,Excellent access with bags of room anywhere you move separate big entrance for disable people
2484,Limited spaces
2485,"Had some delicious food, nice place and friendly staff"
2486,Our waitress was excellent and the male behind reception was attentive and helpful. 
2487,"There was a path with not too much of an incline to the entrance.  After that, all the paths were too steep and the camber was awful.

No mention of wheelchair users, disability, not map to show which paths might be suitable for disabled people. No information for those needing less noise or with autism.  They have not catered for anyone in a wheelchair - no designated spaces at the picnic tables, no usable toilets, no rides or attractions for disabled children or adults."
2488,"Accessible wet room, easy access to toilet and shower with grab rails and low sink. "
2489,"I have just had my first go at skiing at Braehead, I had an hour of tuition from instructor Louisa from DSUK SNOWSPORT. The hour was over far too quick as I was just getting the hang of the adapted sit ski. I would recommend anyone who wants to have a go at skiing just go for it. It was great fun even though I had a couple of falls but Louisa was great getting me back up on ski and going again. I did not have any time to check out any of the facilities as I had to be elsewhere but there was the usual coffee venues and there was a selection of restaurants."
2490,Loix is one of the village on the island of Ile de Re. In the town centre is a church and a couple of restaurants. On the outskirts of the town are the salt fields.
2491,"Staff were fine (considering the hour and the volume of other patrons), service too was speedy."
2492,Disabled parking for one car available at rear (book via no. on website).  Bit tricky to find but detailed instructions sent.  On street parking at front (not disabled and very busy).
2493,"Staff on the information desk in the Great Court are friendly and helpful. Other staff are variable. On this visit I tried to enter the Museum via the back entrance. The lift there was out of order, but without any sign or information to tell us it was out of order. Eventually a pig-rude member of staff came and barked at me that it was broken and that I had to go outside and work my way round to the front of the Museum. Here I found one of the two platform lifts was, as usual, broken down."
2494,"No lift insitu as level access throughout the inside and outside of the building from the car park or the bus stop. Wheelchair spaces at the front and towards the centre of the cinema  screens 1,3,4,5 & 8. Screen number 2,6 and 8 however only have limited spaces for wheelchairs. The haywood suite has no wheelchair access.

All of the 9 cinema screens have audio hearing loops installed and screen 4 has a audio description system for the visually impaired. "
2495,"There is an accessible toilet near the main entrance. It's a bit too small, and there were large rubbish bins in the wheelchair transfer area, which is annoyingly thoughtless."
2496,"make it easy to get help if needed, very experienced at working with people with different needs"
2497,Reasonable toilet with plenty of grab rails
2498,There is some sofas in reception. The signs were clear. There were some steps and lifts.
2499,"It would be five stars but for the occasional driver who didn't ""curtsey"" the bus to enable me to back the manual wheelchair off without using the ramp and for the occasional fellow passengers who didn't vacate the wheelchair spaces. Bus stops are clearly labeled and provide clear information about timetables and routes."
2500,"My husband pushing a trolley & me in my powerchair was asked three times by different members of staff in the garden centre if we wanted assistance even if it was to look at the plants properly. When we got to the checkout we was asked again. 

"
2501,"All very pleasant and friendly, appeared very approachable. only negative was once inside the minister the number of staff around significantly decreased."
2502,This is a review from my mum of the sports facility as the vaccination centre. She has a hidden impairment and told me about her experience with herself and me (wheelchair user) in mind.
2503,If you can make it it the top of the hill (and it really isn't that hard - the path winds gently round the edge) you are rewarded by stunning views of the Cheviots in the distance as well as the sea.  There's good parking and the paths are smooth for the most part. There's an out and back route on the Tarmac path. However if you're a bit more adventurous and your wheels are up to it - go down the hill on the far side. This takes you down to the pond and then onto the old railway line. Perfect for dogs too. There are lots of benches for impromptu rests.
2504,An accessible toilet is available on the West side of the Square. It is part of a suite of toilets.
2505,"A group of disabled people and carers went. 
There's ramped access to the front door and a central lift gives easy access to each floor and room. 
The exhibits are accessible with large print and hearing loops which mostly worked. "
2506,Walkable from Penarth train station. Not sure about parking or other transport options.
2507,"The accessible toilet was just big enough for a wheelchair user and someone to assist them. It didn’t have an emergency red cord though which are very important and it could do with a little bit of a freshen up, a lick of paint or something. Wheelchair users would only be able to transfer from the left-hand side of the toilet.

There is no Changing Places toilet here. The closest one is roughly a 9-minute drive away in the Macrobert Art Centre."
2508,It's easy to get to the Royal Mile either by bus or taxi. Not sure where the nearest Blue Badge parking is. If you're getting there under your own steam then remember it's at the top of a hill!
2509,Easter Road. Recommended blue badge parking on St Clair Street was full and on a very steep hill. No knowledge of public transport options.
2510,"There are 3 converted cottages on this site, 2 x 3 bedroom and 1 x 2 bedroom. The owners have thought of everything for the disabled user.
Obviously wheelchair access, all on one level and solid oak non slip flooring.
Really large wet rooms in 3 bed cottages, and wheeled shower chairs supplied. They can provide a profile bed and organise the hire of other equipment such as power chairs etc.
Excellent kitchen and lounge space with large fold back doors to easy access patio looking over open countryside.
Our only criticism was the small 'cloakroom sized sink in the wet room, however there is also a family bathroom with normal sink.
Ample parking for 3 or more vehicles."
2511,"Devon rail on one side of toilet, fixed bar on the other, heightened bowl. Remarkable for a B & B."
2512,The bank is in a pedestrianised street so close proximity parking might be challenging. There are plenty of bus services passing nearby but they are a wee bit distant.
2513,There are several accessible toilets throughout the Zoo. The one I used was good. There was plenty of space and room for a carer. It had grab rails and the sink and dryer were all within easy reach. On top of that it was really clean and tidy.
2514,"The ferry was very accessible for the wheelchair, actually much more so than I expected. We had an accessible cabin which was more than adequate for our overnight crossing from Aberdeen to Lerwick on Shetland. We also took the car across with us and that was very well organised and seemed a well drilled process. "
2515,The staff at the garden centre were okay but the staff at the coffee shop were excellent.
2516,They lose a star because they closed all of the lifts during refurbishment. 
2517,"Of course you will have to go back inside to the hotel, but if you chose to go out at the rear of hotels exits to gardens, then other toilets are available, so we have dropped the stars for this reason."
2518,"Gregorio was an excellent driver, very knowledgeable and he spoke English well. He was extremely thoughtful and considerate throughout the tour and would sometime park the vehicle so I could get a good view without having to get out. "
2519,"When I arrived at 1st floor surgical reception I was asked to provide a urine sample. There was no accessible toilet in the reception area where I was seated and a member of staff had to escort me through a locked door into Section D where there were accessible toilets. When I did get to the accessible toilet it was spacious and had grab rails and an emergency cord. Also when the staff had asked for a sample they handed me a test tube and seemed surprised when I said I couldn't manage that and required a cardboard pan, and then had to go and find me one.

When I was on T6 Gynae Ward, initially I had a catheter and then I used the assessible toilet on the ward which was spacious, had grab rails and 2 emergency cords.
"
2520,"The accessible loos in M&S are perfect (especially with the added Euan's guide 'red cord emergency' cards. The loos in other venues (eg Cafe Nero and Giraffe restaurant) are good but have small things to change to make them perfect too - for example, pedal-powered bins - a bugbear of mine. "
2521,Level access from car park into the restaurant. Two manually operated doors at entrance. Spacious ground level seating area with steps up to a raised seating are. 
2522,Street parking only and at busy times during the week it can be hard to find a parking space. 
2523,Lovely afternoon tea. The room we were in was upstairs but staff directed us to the lift. The room we were in was well set out so I had plenty of room to move around. 
2524,"Ramp up to door but difficult to steer wheelchair in as not much room at door. Not on any public transport routes, fair walk from closest bus stop round the back of an industrial estate."
2525,"Each deck does have flat level access, but the pools are inaccessible. There are 4 lifts at either end of the ship, and 2 outside, but they are often filled with able bodied passengers, meaning we had to wait for over 15 minutes to be able to go upstairs. Most ports have ramps to get on and off the ship, and the staff are extremely helpful as they are very steep. Tender ports are harder, if you cannot walk approximately 10 steps its a no-go. The accessible staterooms have automatic doors, and wet-room bathrooms. The floor outside the bathroom is ramped, and there is roughly 24 square metres of space. Special needs at sea can supply equipment to be delivered directly to the stateroom. The corridors are wide enough for a standard width manual or electric wheelchair, however the housekeeping carts to obstruct access, but the housekeepers will help you to move them to let you pass. All restaurants are accessible, and you are given a list of every accessible toilet on board. The staff do their best to meet your every need, and help is available at all hours. There are sun-beds covering almost every inch of spare space outside, but there is a path wide enough between them."
2526,"I arrived to the station by train and then walked. There was a very full taxi section where there were also disabled parking bays available. 

The nearest bus station is in Piccadilly Gardens."
2527,Didn't see overgate staff but staff in shops were very nice. 
2528,"We parked in a normal parking space, but disabled parking was widely available"
2529,"This is a great pub, with excellent food and drink and truly helpful and friendly staff who go out of their way to try and make things easier, such as taking a chair away from a table without being asked.  The toilet is large and well equipped - which makes life a lot easier. 

Access to the pub is available via the front and the rear -  no steps but the front entrance may be a little narrow for larger chairs or powerchairs, but the rear has a double door and a ramp.  The only downside is the parking - it's a small car park and a very popular pub - the last time I went at the weekend someone blocked my door to my car even though we were parked in a disabled space."
2530,Baumwipfelpfad Schwarzwald is a wheelchair accessible elevated walkway in the Black Forest culminating in a spiral tower with an (optional) slide back down the middle. It's a very enjoyable and unique way to experience the forest.
2531,The building is perfectly accessible. The seating may let the venue down but I am unsure how this can be improved upon - they do a great job and the Royal Albert Hall does have many other assets.
2532,"There is no parking onsite, parking is a few minutes walk away in the City Centre. Buses stop nearby also in the City Centre."
2533,"https://www.sharjahartmuseum.ae/Home.aspx This  Art Museum exceeded my expectations. The building inside was beautiful well ventilated and reasonably well lit they also had features on exhibitions where you could download a bar code  audio description of the picture, The building is wheelchair access a ball with ramps and lifts and the staff could not have been more helpful in terms of helping with opening doors. The exhibitions on display were very interesting and I would certainly recommend anybody going there who happens  to be in the area."
2534,Blue badge spaces right outside the door. Lots of other parking 
2535,"This was a great experience apart from the very officious, 'jobsworth' and negative check-in woman at Portsmouth.  The woman also told us that we had to book a space next to the lift on-board in advance, however, we've never had to do this before and I can't see any info regarding this on their website.  The passport control officer at Portsmouth on the return journey was the loveliest, happiest one we've ever had, so maybe there were complaints about the first one....  All other staff were very, very helpful and went out of their way to help.   We had a lovely journey both ways."
2536,"There is an accessible toilet with rails etc, but it is accessed via a narrow corridor, then you have to turn immediately right to get in to the toilet, which is quite small and you would probably need to reverse out as there is not enough room to turn around. The door opens outwards so there is room to get your wheelchair in"
2537,Sufficient disabled spaces in the arp ark. Several parking spaces on the stretch of Prom towards Heysham. Prom parking there is exclusively for blue badge holders.
2538,"Very good - level entrance, wide doors which helpful staff opened for us, and no internal steps."
2539,Staff are very friendly
2540,"For live shows in the main room, a viewing platform is available. This will be placed in front of the bar at the far side of the main room. When you book tickets, just let the venue know if you want to use the platform to make sure they have it assembled. The platform is only put up when required.
The Leadmill offers a free ticket for a support worker."
2541,"Lovely restaurant beside the waterfront, family friendly with inside play area for the kids. Great food and when I visited it was nice and quiet, so had an enjoyable meal and catch-up with my friend. "
2542,"Staff could do with a bit more training, some don't seem to have much time to be with someone with a disability. Could have braill on products amd prices. They could move the till around a little bit so people in a wheelchair don't have to stretch."
2543,"There is an accessible toilet in the lobby adjacent to the reception. 
"
2544,"Coming through the countryside, we came to the farm shop (photo 1). We now pulled over to the right to reach the farm shop. There was at least 4 disabled bays outside the wooden sheds (photo 2) which held the shop. Automatic double doors to  enter the shop, however there is a tiny little step to get over, but it wasn’t a problem. This took us to the meat department, but it was all prepacked and there was room to move around quite comfortably. (Photo 5 shows ) a reasonable selection of veg, 
but (photo 6) very limited fruit. In the refrigerated area, (photo 7) there was an assortment of goods. The bread was all rewrapped (photo 8) obviously brought in, as it seemed that it was not baked on the premises. There was also a few cakes, (photo 9) bottles of wine and eggs. There are three checkout points, (photo 10) and then you are back outside again.
We then had to exit the farm, and drive round again, to come back into the farm, but this time we kept over to the left to drive round the back to the cafe. 
Parking, (photo 11) we only found one disabled bay. Now it is quite a push from the car to the cafe, and If it is raining, you are going to get quite wet. (photo 12) The walk leads you to the brick courtyard, where the door into cafe would make a disabled person struggle to open it, (photo 13) so we left the wheelchair outside while we took photos. You pass the counter (14) were you will order and pay up front, but we feel you would struggle to find room for wheelchair or scooter in the crowded cafe, (photo 15) as it seems to be a popular place.
There are two toilets, men’s, and combined ladies and disabled (photo 16) with a pull 
handle to get in. There is not a lot of room in there (photo 17) but has got grab rails and pull cord. It was clean and tidy.
There is not much for children to do here, few small bits and pieces, and only a very limited amount of farm animals to look at.

Our final thoughts. 
Mixed feelings, I did not dislike it, but my husband was not impressed. The farm and shop are just wooden framed buildings, but in shop plenty of room to move around. It seemed to be very popular, so we leave it up to you to decide whether you visit"
2545,The staff make it easy to relax. They helped me move around and were always ready with a smile and an arm to lean on.
2546,"Lovely friendly staff, helpful, patient, professional."
2547,Plenty of lifts and folding seats are available 
2548,There are some Blue Badge bays in the nearby street. London buses also pass nearby. Charing Cross station is a short distance away.
2549,"A new public entrance has been created to coincide with the opening of the museum which provides a steps free entrance. The museum and chapel are all located on the ground floor and there are no steps. The museum is small and the passage way  through the museum can get busy.  From the museum there is entrance into the chapel. The Thackeray café, next door has a couple of steps at the entrance but there is a buzzer for people with disabilities that need help and I noted that there is a fold up ramp by the door. The café is a self service restaurant."
2550,Very large accessible toilet.
2551,"This is a music festival sponsored by John Lewis - which says it all, take what you want from that.

It certainly appeals to a certain age group, Travis were doing their album 'The Man Who' in full, other acts included Kate Tempest, Steve Mason and Metronomy. It was very much right up our street.

Access was pretty good too! "
2552,"Most of the building is very accessible, bar the chaplaincy (to the far left of the building, accessed through a side door), which has steps to the first floor and there is no lift in this section of the building."
2553,"There are two disabled parking bays down at the beach.  Discussions with the local authority are ongoing about getting a third parking bay.  In the summer, Coldingham bay can be very busy and you may find that these bays may be occupied on arrival.  If this is the case we recommend that the wheelchair user is let out at the parking bays and the driver takes the car upto the main carpark.   However, we realise that this may not be feasible but unfortunately the project does cannot reserve a parking bay"
2554,"Went with family members as I have a hidden disability and went in with my sunflower lanyard, not sure due to 'covid' measures if there was a sign saying Exit only but as normal daft me went in the Exit to be prompted to go out and through the other door oops! Anyway, staff were friendly enough and not sure if I had missed the sign that did say Exit, didn't seem to see one... must have missed it... there didn't seem to be a big one. Went and got a drink and snack and to use the loos... This is possibly a one off so can't seem to do them for this, but the disabled toilet was out of order and had to use the normal ones, which was ok as am abled bodied enough.  A bit of water on the floor and couldn't seem to get the loos to work but other than that and not wanting to use the dryer as there was a few people around everything went ok. "
2555,"It was a great experience from beginning to end. Visitors with mobility impairments need to be aware that it is a fair distance from the visitor centre to the house and whilst the paths are very good they are on an incline. It's a fabulous roll down to the house but you have to climb back up on the way back to the visitor centre. We took the view that we'd roll down to the house and gardens first. On the way back we would take the hill gently and in stages with a reward of coffee and cake once we made it to the visitor centre! 

The visitor centre was on two levels with a good sized lift serving both areas. Downstairs was the ticket area, the shop, and exhibition space; as well as the toilets. Upstairs was the cafe and a further accessible toilet. 

The house was fronted by a beautiful garden area and although the paths looked to be gravel they were a resin bonded gravel which was great to wheel over. The house has glass entrance doors and once inside you entered the hallway. A delight in itself with a host of curious things to behold. A warm welcome was given by the stewards and we were offered the audio guide sets with a choice of dramatised tour or a more factual one. I am not a fan of headsets so I opted to take the printed transcript which was fantastic. 

Our tour took us around the main rooms of the ground floor. All easy to wheel around and see everything. From the study where Walter Scott wrote much of his work through to the magnificent library housing a collection of curios second to none with locks of hair, religious artefacts, texts and so much more. Names like Nelson, Mary Queen of Scots, 'Bonnie Prince Charlie' and Flora MacDonald to name but a few - all housed in an octagonal display table which was easy to wheel up to and see everything. The views from the low windows were fabulous - no peering up and over something here - as it was easy to see the beautiful gardens, the meadow and the River Tweed winding its way to the sea.

The tour took us into the dining room with a massive table and beautiful china, a splendid bay window with amazing views and the feeling of history as this was Walter Scott's final resting place before passing away.

We moved on to the anti chamber near the front hall where we imagined folk would sit and rest a while before going to meet Walter Scott. Again, amazing pictures and curios as well as beautiful stained glass with depictions of the Stirling Heads from Stirling Castle.

Leaving the house we meandered along to the gardens. Here there are some steps but we found the wheelchair accessible route that runs along a well surfaced path parallel to the gardens where, at strategic points, you could wheel into the different levels of the garden. Once in the garden the paths were a little more rustic but perfectly fine for us to wheel along. We were rewarded with beautiful shrubbery, a kitchen plot, amazingly aromatic roses, and so much more. At the top you can sit a while and just look down across the walled gardens and the house nestling in the distance.

After the gardens we took the path back to the visitor centre and from here we took one of the woodland paths. Nicely surfaced and offering some welcome shade on a blisteringly hot summer's day. Time for us to break out the picnic!"
2556,Staff let you browse at your leisure. There is a lot to see.
2557,"I didn’t find the staff overly helpful and the accessible room was rather tight, especially in bathroom.  There wasn’t a lot of room in the lift.  Getting from the Carpark to the entrance was also a bit of a challenge with parked vehicles and a narrow pathway.  Wasn’t able to use the pool either. "
2558,"There are some bus stops on George IV Bridge, the number 23, 27, 41 and 42 stop there. I think it might be on some of the tour bus routes too.
Parking isn't great nearby. You might be lucky and get a space on Chambers Street.
The restaurant is walkable from Waverley Station but it is up a steep hill. "
2559,"It is clear some members of staff at Cameron house are trying to make their facilities more accessible. I take my dad regularly to use the disabled shower. The ramp beside the stairs has only recently removed the loose stones but still not perfect (wheelchair sinks in rain) only one disabled shower room, manual doors, no hoist in pool however work is being done to make gym facilities more accessible. Some staff  however are not as gracious at times making us feel unwelcome. (Have seen a family with disabled son carry him in as path is bumpy and ramp still inadequate)"
2560,"The staff were first class. Very good at their jobs, and treated my friend, who can be quite picky, with respect. I wrote to thank them next day for their part in making our night out very enjoyable."
2561,"Both the Blue Badge parking zone and the drop-off point are much further away from the venue entrance (itself up one floor via an unmarked lift) than anyone can walk who qualifies for a Badge. If your mobility is restricted, don't think about coming here without a powered chair or scooter, or - unless you are a Paralympian - someone to push you in a manual chair. Not sure how this got past the planners."
2562,"The main car park was spacious and well laid out. There are, however, plenty of disabled spaces at the rear of the main building. They are accessed through an alternative entrance and signs from the main road should be followed. The spaces themselves are near to the main facilities."
2563,"Entrance is level access with automatic doors. 

Aisles are wide and shelves not too high. Lights are bright, no music.

No designated accessible till but all three tills wide enough. Hearing loop available.

The path to walk to McDonald's & Morrison's is too narrow for a chair. "
2564,Nice and helpful.
2565,"I went on the East Lancs Railway Steam Train between Bury and Rawtenstall. The staff and experience far exceeded my expectations. The access to the station is via a ramp once you have purchased your tickets and then for people unable to use the foot bridge, there is access (with help from) a member of staff across the track. The train has a lovely adapted wheelchair carriage with plenty of room. The guard asked me what I thought of the new carriage (which still has all of its original old character and smells) I thought it was amazing. In coming months they are adding further accessible carriages. There's not an accessible toilet on the train but there is at both Bury and Rawtenstall which were extremely clean. A thoroughly fantastic day :)"
2566,I did not have much need to interact with staff. They seemed extremely busy. 
2567,"Throughout the village there is amply space for you to get around, even though it can be really full at times. There are no steps, it’s all flat and easy to get around, and we certainly saw everything. Plenty of seating areas for tired legs and heavy bags."
2568,"The hotel has its own car parking and an entrance from the car park directly in to the hotel.

Conveniently placed, the hotel is a short distance from Princes Street and the many buses, trams, taxis and tour buses that travel along there."
2569,"A wheelchair accessible day care for people who have all forms of dementia, the volunteers take them out and play all kinds of games everyday"
2570,It was a smooth surface with a slight step but not too big for my scooter. 
2571,Technically wheelchair accessible but very small. They are a good optician's though so worth the hassle of the small size of the building. 
2572,"The accessible toilet is on the second floor and is reached via a platform lift. There is no signage to this toilet. There is an obscure door leading from the main bar to the platform lift, with no signage on it. The lift is fine. The toilet itself would be fine if the thoughtless staff hadn't placed two bins in the wheelchair transfer area, see my picture below."
2573,"Homelands has been designed specifically with disability in mind. The complex caters for all forms of disability with ample space to accommodate family, friends and carers."
2574,"Close bus stop and good parking, but pavements a bit rough and nearest station isn't step free."
2575,"I visit this pool regularly with my Mum, who is almost entirely reliant on a wheelchair. The access to the pool is graduated and they have a pool chair which you can borrow so you can get into the pool. The staff are always very helpful and willing to lend floatation aids etc. It tends to be a quite quiet during the week, but with different kinds of users; children, 'serious' swimmers and disabled people (obviously some of these groups cross over; someone could be all three!).

There are two disabled changing cubicles with showers. Where the water is shallow, they have a ledge to sit on, where there are bubble jets you can ask to be put on - the closest option to an accessible jacuzzi available locally.

The only criticisms would be that the bar around the side of the pool is difficult to grab onto, and the locks aren't great on the cubicles; they can only be locked and unlocked from the inside, which isn't great if, like me, you're trying to combine privacy with safety."
2576,"We visited the Cavern Club during our short stay in Liverpool. We went on a Thursday evening. The club is in the cellar and not wheelchair accessible at the main entrance door but the bouncer was more than happy to take us to the accessible back door entrance (used by VIPs like Paul McCartney 🎸). Once we entered the club via the back door (which had level access) we then went in a lift and down a steep ramp through venue 2 and into venue 1. There is a gift shop which leads to the main club . It was loud and pretty busy with people from all age groups. When we arrived there was a band playing covers and afterwards there was a Beatles tribute band.(watch short video). There were a few tables but unfortunately they were all taken. Most people were standing/dancing/singing .This meant that because I am in a wheelchair my view of the stage was blocked but there were screens on the walls that had live footage of the stage. There is also a bar (see photo). It was loud and the atmosphere was great. The staff were extremely helpful.
I would definitely recommend a visit to the Cavern Club."
2577,Every toilet in the main areas are disabled and there are 3 around the reception and the dining room/kitchen. In the bedrooms the bedrooms have walk in showers with a shower seat and rail with assistance around the toilet too including an alarm string in case there was no carer present. 
2578,Very inclusive.
2579,There at least 6 disabled bays at the Spa and along the root dedicated disabled parking. Theses can be filled quickly in the summer. There is also disable parking on the Esplande in South Cliff just by the life lift which provide easy access to and from the sea front. Disk parking is also available on the streets by the cliff lift which are obtainable from shops nearby on Filey Road.
2580,"Wide aisles, generous sized lift"
2581,"We came by car, disabled parking is right next to Palace disabled entrance "
2582,Parking no issue.
2583,"I give a low rating as a radar key is needed, a lack of hoists and the temperature of the water is unreliable. The toilets are clean however and there is enough space inside and outside of the toilet for me to get around."
2584,Lots of well-maintained wheelchair accessible paths(especially the flat path to Stones Island).  The restaurant is accessed via a lift in the main building.  The children's playground is accessible with a wheelchair(if a little steep in places).  There are lots of benches in the playground and seating areas in the courtyard next to snack bars and shops.
2585,"Only two and half stars because 

(i) Only the ground floor of this shop is wheelchair-accessible, the basement can only be reached by a staircase

(ii) The portable wheelchair ramp used to give access at the entrance to the shop is too short (staff are aware and have said they'll obtain a safer, longer one)
 "
2586,"The main entrance is up 3 steps And if I was on my own, there was not always staff at the door to get me in, although most people are very helpful and will alert a member of staff. 
The wheelchair entrance is through a side door where there's access to a platform lift. Unfortunately when I was there it was broken so was taken to the main entrance and had to go up quite a steep ramp. Coming back out I had to go backwards. Once in there is a ramp that takes you to the bar area and in the foyer there was a small lift to take me to the theatre which was operated by staff as it needed a key."
2587,Plenty of disabled spaces but these are always very busy
2588,"Everyone had fun, It was a very social day full of lots of laughs, Liverpool Albert docks has a great vibe with lots to do, there was live music, variety of shops and so on. The group loved the boat experience   Woodside Cafe is spacious to move around and the U boat is free with boat ticket to have a look at, It is in 3 pieces so you can see inside no climbing on board to do so, be warned to get to and from the pier there is a steep incline, 2 of our passengers chose to do it using a walker,they still wanted to do it and said it was worth it but it did look like hard work for them, one gentlemen was in wheelchair and myself as tour assistant and his wife pushed him up also 2 people in group with sturdy mobility scooters found it no problem and another gentlemen with a light weight scooter that had been playing up on him needed a bit of assistance."
2589,"I decided to stay overnight in Glasgow following the Euan’s Guide Ambassadors event meet and review of both Glasgow Winter Markets. This Hotel was popular and often full, mentioned on Booking.com. As a budget Hotel with basic services and a price to match, could not fault it. It was exactly as described on the Hotel website and by uk standards a 2* Facility. The entrance foyer was ample in terms of space, stair cases to 7 floors and 2 lifts occupancy for 4 - 6 people ample space for wheelchair space and access. There was no car parking facility, but travelling by train or bus was only 40 m away. I was informed by someone who had stayed there last year, the breakfasts were buffet style, limited choice but plenty and it certainly was.
The room I had was large and spacious, comfortable and well provisioned, each floor was fully accessible."
2590,Blue badge parking in the street outside
2591,"There is a disabled toilet at the Newtown Linford car park that has a radar key, to access this there is a short 2 minute walk to the conservatory tea room that the staff will give you the key. This toilet has a hoist, bed and hand rails that cater for all needs and can easily manover a wheelchair in and out of the toilet, all accessible by a ramp."
2592,"The staff were genuinely lovely, they have done great things with this old venue to make it accessible, the only thing that lets them down is the toilet. I have added a photo of the view of the stage. It’s a side on view so a very small area of stage you might not be able to see fully, but I was able to see all the main actors and songs of the show. "
2593,The theatre is a couple of minutes walk from Finsbury Park tube/ train station. The nearest step free tube is Highbury and Islington and then a bus journey (no 4 or 19 from Highbury Corner). At present there is building work taking place at Finsbury Park Station to enable it to become step free by 2019.
2594,"Young friendly, helpful and professional."
2595,"Lots of them, knowledgable and happy to help explain displays."
2596,"All cottages have level access, wet rooms and one has a ceiling hoist and an adjustable kitchen. They are nicely furnished and comfortable."
2597,Lots of parking at the mall including Blue Badge spaces. There is also a Shopmobility area with parking .
2598,Very helpful with everything except the toilet issue - directed us to a 'nearby' toilet with a hoist - over half a mile walk away
2599,"I would give higher if I could. As soon as I go in, the staff know I'm not always good on my feet. Straight away, they will leave what they're doing and bring me a key for a scooter. When I've finished shopping, I only have to ask and the security guard will get me a trolley to put my shopping in. All through the store, there are plenty of people working on the shop floor to help reach items "
2600,"Grab rails by the toilet.  Very clean, with lots of room to turn around.  Last time I was there, there were wheelchairs and other items in the toilet, but these have now all been cleared out.  Staff are always on hand if you need any help getting into the toilet such as opening the door."
2601,"This convenience store ticks all the boxes.  Level access; automatic door; wide, uncluttered aisles; excellent signage to suit visually impaired, autistic, etc; lowered counter; most commonly wanted goods and produce displayed at wheelchair level, freezer contents can be viewed from a wheelchair with staff trained to assist where necessary; ATM"
2602,"Our hosts were attentive, considerate and their story telling captivating.

During our tour there were small things, wheelchair users will recognise, that make life a bit more of a challenge. As we moved around on the tour these obstacles such as the seats were moved, and our drinks carried. No trying to figure out lifts or platform lifts as we were accompanied when using these and it was seamless. 

It was amazing to be asked, part way into the tour, by our host if we were OK and happy ... this just doesn't normally happen ... "
2603,There are a large number of staff/attendants and life guards throughout the beach.
2604,Where there were steps there were ramps but if too steep access/excit can be gained via shop. Can only tell you about mobility access.
2605,Wheelchair access will depend on your chair in my opinion as in areas it is very narrow and dark as well. 
2606,Moto have re-designed their entrance from the disabled parking bays. You now have to walk all the way around the restaurant spaces to reach the disabled toilet (singular!) instead of twenty yards from the old entrance. The toilets have not been up-dated for some years and I cannot recommend them. What a missed opportunity to improve the accessibility and disabled facilities of the site. If you use a scooter or wheelchair at busy times you will have to be very careful !
2607,"You need to go in the rear door if you're in a wheelchair and there is a bit of a bump to get into this doorway but it is nothing critical, just awkward.
Additionally, the accessible toilet is the back of the restaurant and you may need to ask people to move if they are near the door."
2608,"The Crick Institute undertakes scientific research about health and disease. It's the largest biomedical (relating to both biology and medicine) research institute in Europe. It's a working building and while its laboratories are not open to the public, there are public areas where fascinating exhibitions and regular events are held. It's engaging and similar in style to what is on offer at the Wellcome Collection. It's housed in a very striking contemporary step free building, which is impressive and well worth visiting for the architecture alone. "
2609,"All the staff are so helpful, they really enjoy their employment and share this with visitors"
2610,We normally go by car and there is plenty of accessible parking available outside the hotel. There may be public transport options available but I have not investigated these options yet 
2611,"Access into the cottage is via one step or a simple ramp.  There is plenty of space to move around the cottage and it's all on one level. Access to the patio area is by way of the patio doors which has a small lip to step over or via a small ramp at the side of the cottage.
You could probably use a manual wheelchair, but would struggle with an electric scooter due to its size. The owner will be happy to discuss your individual needs and accommodate you if at all possible, I would advise speaking to Lisa before booking."
2612,"Main reason this church is accessible is because of the people there. We have had issues with other churches in the past, but everyone here was incredibly welcoming when we visited.  "
2613,"Toilets were we'll sign posted, in good condition and very spacious."
2614,"We only used public transport so don't know what parking is like.
We love the public transport in Barcelona, the Metro, Tram and Bus network is great as a power wheelchair user.
Our friends who are Spanish has booked the Mon Bus to Sitges and Plana Bus to Tarragona a number of times for us and that too works very well as a day trip. As a wheelchair user you do have to book the bus."
2615,This Cafe Nero is located in the town centre and there is some parking in nearby streets. There is disabled parking within the Thistle shopping centre multi storey car park which is about 15 mins away. Stirling rail and bus stations are about 10-15 minutes away. 
2616,"Glasgow fort is an outdoor shopping complex with a cinema, restaurants and children's play areas. There is a large car park with a lot of access parking close to the front of the stores. The walkway around the complex is all on one level, and stores are at ground level on entering however most of them have at least one floor above. On first looking in the stores it is not always obvious where the lifts are, if any, and the layout of some of the stores has rails very close together. Not all stores have toilet facilities, however all cafes and restaurants do, the doors to some store fronts are not automatic so could be difficult to negotiate. There are many water bowls for dogs positioned around the outside of the stores, and assistance dogs are allowed in stores. 
The music in certain stores can be very loud, but i find the music in the cafes and eating areas is a lot calmer. There is a wide selection of restaurants to suit dietary needs, and they seem to be very spacious, but do get very busy at lunch and dinner rush hours. "
2617,"The whole site is wheelchair accessible with level thresholds on the doors, doors that are wide.

There are a number of disabled toilets around the site that are large and clean. They are well sign posted and visible from a great distance.

The main exhibition halls are fully chair accessible with everything on the same level. The exhibition halls have disabled toilets but the thing that makes this venue stand out above others is the Rolls-Royce of Changing Places.

The Changing Place is located in the exhibition hall and is fully equipped to meet the needs of those who require these facilities. We found them very clean and the quality of the equipment is of the highest standard. There is plenty of room for carers and due to the size there is ample privacy.

The provision of this Changing Place sets The Yorkshire Showground out from many other visitor attractions and opens up all the great shows that go on there to everyone."
2618,"Staff get full marks. On more than one occasion we were asked if we needed any assistance as we moved around the floors, shops and eateries. All done in a discrete and helpful manner."
2619,Easily accessed toilets with ample room for manoeuvre.
2620,"I took the wheelchair taxi, but public buses will stop here, and large car park with several dedicated accessible spaces"
2621,"Step free access to all areas on various terrains but mostly flat. There is a slope up through the rockery which might be tough in a manual chair but worth it to view the waterfall areas. I had no problem in my powerchair.  There are good spaces in the cafe and restaurant with reserved priority seating for wheelchair users.  Tables have a high clearance to get under.  There is both a ramp and lift to the upper level in the glass house.
The pond area  has no barrier before the path slopes into the water which might be an issue for visually impaired visitors. There are seats to rest on all around the gardens. The cafe has gluten free food."
2622,Staff were really helpful
2623,"As it's in the West End, driving is a bit of a non starter. Nearest stepfree tube is quite a way. We walked/wheeled from Waterloo which was a good 25 minutes."
2624,Full disabled facilities 300m away at the yacht harbour
2625,Free parking in quiet side road at front of hotel. Main road and bus route behind hotel.. didnt check out the public transport.
2626,The Central Bar is a disabled friendly bar. The bar is one one level with a small ramp to the toilets. Staff are friendly and accommodating. All welcome. 
2627,"Such lovely, friendly staff! "
2628,"Right beside the cafe, clearly signed, very clean, bright and spacious."
2629,"A lovely fish and chip restaurant / takeaway with good wheelchair access and helpful, friendly  staff."
2630,They met me outside the train station and picked me up at Pittodrie Stadium.
2631,Stunning spot for lunch. Parked in hotel car park and there was wheelchair access through the hotel reception and into the bar.
2632,Used public transport Docklands Light Railway. The lift takes you to the pavement level and you walk past about 4 dock buildings on smooth surface to the museum. The front of the museum is cobble stones. All level access.
2633,"Went out during Pride in my powerchair and found that bar one place, nowhere was accessible. Was just glancing into Poptastic mourning the lost days of my able-bodied youth when one of the bouncers asked if I wanted to come in. I said yes, but those four steps look formidable, and he offered to run round the back and get the ramp! I hadn't had this experience at any other bar we passed and was very surprised. The staff were incredibly helpful and gave me clear directions, and the back door took me straight to the dancefloor! It was easy to get attention when I wanted to leave for the ramp to be put back, too. By far my best experience in Manchester's gay village."
2634,"The parking is not all that easy, it’s quiet a way from front entrance into hotel, and you will need to be pushed across compacted chippings, but it’s easy enough. 
You will need to enter reception, before going out of far door to be able to see the Spa and Gym facilities. This means we can only offer 3.5 stars at the moment, it will get more points when work completed on refurbishments later on next year."
2635,"Several car parks along the way but if you are unsure, head for Tiverton canal car park. "
2636,"We arrived from the Banbury area, and main A422, and you pass this delightful hotel as you enter Wroxton village, but you need to drive round the bend to find its car park. The entrance itself gives you a feeling that all is going to be well.  You can be dropped off by foyer entrance while driver parks up, or park yourself before making your way into hotel. However, the car park area is on a stoney and rough area, we found it hard work to get across to foyer, so lower marks given at this time for parking. If it happens to be raining on your visit you may not be very pleased about that by the time you get into hotel, as we found no disabled area provided near the foyer. But please do not let that spoil this delightful little hotel visit for you, stick it out and you will really enjoy your visit."
2637,"Gorgie Farm Review

Students from the Entry to Learning Level 2 course at Edinburgh College visited Gorgie farm as part of their Leonard Cheshire Can Do community review project.

We had a tour round the farm from the very friendly and knowledgeable Francis. She explained to us facts about each animal and what uses they have on the farm. We then had hands on experience with some of the animals where we got to touch a turtle, a chinchilla, a guineapig and a bearded dragon lizard!

Overall we gave it 4.5 out of 5 and would definitely recommend a visit!

Comments from the class were;

“Its Interesting to see animals and to be able to touch and find out about them”

“The staff were really nice and the animals were friendly!”

“Be prepared for the smell!!”
"
2638,No signage  for disabled spaces or the toilet which we found by luck.  Although the paths were step free and smooth they are narrow and a queue is formed waiting to enter the building - to get to the toilet you have to get through the queue so it was slow going.  Allow plenty of time for a visit here.
2639,"Staff were brilliant, helpful and friendly!"
2640,"Access into the fringe shop and the accessible booking service was a breeze! Here's why - we used the ""Welcome"" app by NeateBox to let them know we were coming and would need a hand with the door. When we arrived the door was open and a small ramp made it easy to get in to the shop. The door does have a push pad to trigger the door opening if it happens to be closed.

Once inside there was plenty of space to move around. It was easy to wheel up to the accessible ticket collection point where we were expected. Whilst we were there we checked out the sensory backpacks Roland got to hear more about the ""Magic carpets"" which were bright blue carpets strategically positioned at street performances to make it easier for wheelchair users to get a great view of the entertainment. 

The programme for the fringe is online and you can pick up a print copy the in the shop. It's got loads of information about the accessibility of the fringe and its loads of shows. Relaxed performances, sensory performances and so much more. I didn't know what to choose to see as so many performances now have wheelchair access."
2641,No red cord or tied up high 
2642,Staff were friendly - it was a busy Saturday and a long queue of people!
2643,"This is a new bar in Belfast that I am becoming to enjoy more and more as it finds its feet.

It's a bar that I suspect would be busy after work on Friday, but that's find as it can cope with it.  With the red statue at the front and the wooden outdoor structure it could had easily became a gimmick bar. 

It has a great selection of beer and when we went on a Saturday afternoon a family were playing traditional folk music in the corner. 

Inside the bar is very dark so that could be problematic for some impairments. However, outside is very light and covered in areas."
2644,"Entrance, shop and entry to garden tricky and cramped for wheelchair.
Main paths wheelchair friendly. Some lesser paths harder work - eg walled garden. Greenhouses not wheelchair accessible (steps)."
2645,CG2014 venues have no on-site parking however for general use in the future thought car parking signage was insufficient.
2646,The staff are very warm and friendly. The atmosphere in the cafe is very relaxed and homely. 
2647,"The whole garden is accessible including the walled garden. The grounds around the house are also accessible. The cafe has plenty of outside seating. There is indoor seating but it’s not particularly spacious and the cafe can get crowded.

The shop was also not really accessible . 

The house was not really accessible to the scooter, maybe it might be ok in a wheelchair but was difficult to assess."
2648,Cheerful.
2649,"First class through the outlet village. 
Drive to bottom of car park opposite Pizza Express,10 Blue Badge bays. "
2650,"You visit Malin Head because it's the most northerly point in Ireland, and it was definitely good from an access perspective that you can get all the way there by car. There's a car park with a low-key modern toilet block, and when we were there, a couple of trailers selling drinks, home-made cakes and souvenirs. As a scooter-using visitor, I enjoyed the views from the clifftops, the fresh air and being in what still feels like quite a remote, wild place. I really wished I could have gone on some of the gravel paths around the cliffs, though, and there was one in particular where it wouldn't have taken too much more to have made it accessible (level it off a bit and remove the odd small ledge or step. Anyway, it was still a beautiful place and I'm glad I went."
2651,On site and close to entrance
2652,Car park round the back
2653,"Spacy, easy to open manual door. Clean but not locked and open to public. Room for a carer."
2654,"In the station, all on one level.."
2655,Dedicated space right in front of the lodge with others close by.
2656,Excellent transport to travel into town and to the trips provided. Disabled parking also available.
2657,"Parking is right outside the main door and, if needed, there is also ready access from cars through the door into the sitting room."
2658,The staff are friendly and very helpful.
2659,"Parking is on the flat with easy access to the water, either down a wide slipway and onto the wheelie boat through a bow door, or from a floating pontoon.    "
2660,"Flat, easy. "
2661,"Special entrance with paths over the grass to raised area for wheelchairs. Good view of stage.Getting out more tricky as the entrance then turns into an exit for everyone, luckily a man let us through a gate to prevent me getting crushed."
2662,There was no accessible toilet in my room. However the toilet was my the edge of the wall and I was able to grab that to pull myself up. I don't know if the hotel has any communal toilets.
2663,Property not staffed during our stay. Owners were extremely helpful before our stay to make sure all our needs were well catered for.
2664,"Three disabled loos with three disabled showers. No pull cords, though: stipulation of being supervised."
2665,The museum has excellent access and is really spacious with plenty of disabled toilets and plenty of seats for those who can walk short distances.
2666,"Accessible loo was unusual. Grab rails were of a contrasting colour but were of an unusual  shape. There was also a drop down rail which didn't show in photo. Toilet was right hand transfer. Large building but still disabled loo is combined with baby changing facilities. Toilet had a sensor flush and the sink was also a sensor to turn on the water. Bin was a peddle bin. Could turn around in my power chair but would struggle fitting two people inside. The lock was unusual too, hard to turn. Toilet sign is in pictures and contrasting font. I didn't see any changing places toilet. The emergency alarm was a button next to the loo. I didn't check to see if one closer to the floor. "
2667,"A disabled access entrance is placed at the site of the main entrance. This operates using a call button, meaning you are not able to get into the venue independently without requiring the help of staff. Once inside there is a small dining area with stairs to the left. Other areas of the pub can be reached via a lift though I did not have the opportunity to use it. "
2668,Buses stop nearby at Holy Corner - it is a few minutes stroll then to the campus of which the terrain is uneven and bumpy. One crossing can be dangerous at peak times so care is needed. Car parking available outside - metered and blue badge bays. From this the entrance is on the right hand side down two steps or a ramp. 
2669,The disabled toilets are a generous size with grab rails and a lak of clutter.
2670,"no steps, no lips at entrance, no problems"
2671,"Numerous buses serve the area around (but not inside) Soho, the nearest step-free station is Green Park (about a mile away), with Tottenham Court Road station becoming step-free sometime around 2016."
2672,"The Crannog Centre is set on Loch Tay, the actual Crannog is out on the water with a walk way made of tree trunks split in half. There is an exhibition which includes findings of the archaeological dig, which our guest found interesting. There is also a corner of dressing up clothes which we all hand some fun with.  Inside the Crannog is a bit dark and the seating is low therefore if someone is easily disorientated take care. The Guided tour is very informative and gives a good insight into life in the Iron age.  Outside the Crannog, there a lot of hands on activities, which people living with dementia enjoyed. We enjoyed the fire-making demonstration. There is a small Café and a gift shop. A good trip that our group enjoyed."
2673,Front door and doorbell totally inadequate for wheelchair users - apart from that I rate this vet practice very highly
2674,The nearest bus stop to the facility is located outside of the main car park and a path is clearly marked towards the facility.  The disabled parking spaces are located to the right of the facility doors and there is also a taxi rank located directly outside. 
2675,All doors were wide enough for wheelchairs and no steps.
2676,"Excellent main tarmac path and accessible offshoots to two hides provide superb views of estuary wildlife or just a good walk/scoot close to the seaside resort. Seaton front also has a great promenade. Slightly off message, this whole Jurassic Coast area has excellent accessible promenades – Lyme Regis, Sidmouth, Budleigh Salterton, Exmouth to name just a few."
2677,Very friendly & helpful. There were workmen in when we visited& they were very careful & helpful when we passed them. The lady in the shop told us about the stair lift & a member of staff from the cafe came to take me up in that. 
2678,"The theatre is old and characterful but disabled facilities leave much to be desired.  Staff are excellent in helping and trying to overcome deficiencies.  Wheelchair space is at rear of stalls, so fine if all action is on stage floor.  Hope there are no balcony 
scenes.  Disabled toilet is a bit cramped for ordinary wheelchair so problems for larger ones or scooters.
Access to venue is by a side door and you have to buzz staff to come and open it.
Problems would not put us off visiting but Kings falls way short of standards set at Theatre Royal."
2679,Board game cafe with wide range of games. Small food menu with lots of vegan option. Good non-alcoholic drink options as well as interesting alcohol. Physically accessible. Great floor to roll on. Spacious. Staff very helpful. Noisy even after turning music down. Non-gendered toilets. 
2680,"There is no accessible toilet, just small ladies or gents, and I found I needed to get up from my chair to make use of their very clean, nicely decorated toilet facilities."
2681,The staff and volunteers are brilliant. What is remarkable in the context of staff attitudes at many other nature sites is their very obvious willingness to take on board suggested access improvement where it is possible to enhance conditions within budget constraints and construction abilities.
2682,"We enjoyed our journey to the hotel, the driveway itself was most welcoming, and we found two bays right up by hotels entrance ideal for disabled."
2683,"A cafe/coffee shop in the middle of the High Street, kindly people who want to help. 
Has a wide door and accessible tables. 
Unfortunately may change hands as the owners are retiring. "
2684,There was a disabled toilet at the reception but not on the cruise. 
2685,This was my first major trip out since the beginning of lockdown last March having recently been in hospital I was very nervous about going out and about again. I went to Kilwinning to visit a local bridal shop to attend a family wedding. I have to say on my first trip I was pleasantly surprised everyone round about me who is wearing masks and trying to keep their distance as much as possible. The town was fairly quiet as it was later on in the afternoon. The only improvement that I could suggest is the addition of an accessible changing places toilet perhaps within the grounds of the abbey.
2686,Good street level access. Seating inside main entrance doors - these are not automatic doors and can be considered heavy.  There are volunteers at the door to assist.  Internal - floors ar flat with lifts connecting two floors.
2687,There are many accessible toilets throughout the Zoo. There is a good amount of space available in the toilet.
2688,The accommodation was extremely suitable for our wheelchair user.  We were met by Rob on arrival who was very friendly and informative not just about the facilities in the cottage but also about the local attractions.  Good sized wet room in the downstairs bedroom.  The door from the lounge into the porch opens both ways which is ideal for a wheelchair user.  As well as  a profile bed provided there was also a shower chair.
2689,Accessible toilet in the ArtsHouse.
2690,"Cannes has a sandy beach (unlike Nice which has a pebble beach). The beach has free, public areas as well as private areas where you have to pay an admission charge to access and which have beachside restaurants. There is a free section of the beach by Palais des Festivals and there is a ramp to access it.
The beach front road is lined with palm trees, which have lights round their trunks and are illuminated at night.
On the beach side there is a wide, flat, pedestrianised walkway which has quite a lot of seats. Some is fixed seating but there is also the blue, metal chairs that are moveable. When I visited I found that at busy times, ie weekend and sunset, it was quite difficult to find an empty chair. It is dotted with kiosks that sell food and drink.
Near Palais des Festivals is a small, children's amusement area with a couple of rides and is very family friendly, and the start of Le Petit Train de Cannes.
On the opposite side of the street are the designer shops, luxury hotels and apartments.
Generally La Croisette is easy to navigate as there are regular crossings from on side of the street to the other. However I did notice that occasionally there would be a drop kerb one side of the road but not on the opposite side."
2691,There is disabled parking as you enter near stables but we were allowed to park next to accommodation which was a great help.  Gate pin code entry too so no concerns about security of car.
2692,"Thank you to David, Alison and all the team at North Berwick Beach Wheelchairs for their very friendly and professional service. We all had a great time!

Thanks again, 
Stephen."
2693,"This was perfect for me, no steps and two lifts so if one breaks down you’re not stranded! Totally accessible restaurant, plenty of space to move around, table service, wheelchair fit under table well. There are plenty of comfy seats dotted around so if you need to stop and take a break you are able to do so. There is a large accessible toilet in the lounge area too. The room is great, lots of room for my chair. There is a red cord next to the bed. We stayed in an accessible twin room, the beds are not up next to eachother which is great, there are side tables next to the beds, a wardrobe, a chest of drawers, a table and mirror with comfy seat and another chair by the window. It’s a really beautiful room. The curtains were easy to close, there is a peep hole in the door at the perfect height for wheelchair users. The bedroom door is very heavy to open from the inside. "
2694,"The door was quite heavy, but all rails and a red cord were present. Functional"
2695,This is an update review of my previous visit in 2018.
2696,Its an old building with many stairs. But worth it to see the exhibits a real egyptian mummy for one!
2697,Excellent access for a wheelchair. Special parking Bay and paved well.
2698,"There are a number of accessible buses that stop outside or very close to St Paul's. The closest tube station is St Paul's, but it is not step free. The nearest step free tube stations are Blackfriars, this will involve going up Ludgate Hill, and Farringdon, which if you go via Smithfield Market, you can have a flat route."
2699,"Having had numerous difficult journey's with other British Airports Assistance Service's it was a relief to travel with Bristol for the first time.
The desk is easy to find, they had a clear record of the booking. Helped with the bag drop, security was a calm experience and helpful with the chairs and directions clear about where to sit to wait air side. Even better the waiting area is next to their control room so even though the ambulift was late due to another flight holding it up they were able to come and reassure us that we hadn't been forgotten.
This assistance for two wheelchair users was booked via TUI whose Welfare Team were also excellent.
The only reason I have given 4 not 5 stars is the steep-ness of the airport site for wheelchair users, but they have done the best with the terrain they have."
2700,I didn't use the accessible toilets but noticed them on all levels I visited very close to the large modern lift.
2701,"A limited car park outside the castle and a non-accessible bus to the castle from the town centre. I scooted up the long hill from the town centre, where there is plenty of parking, a bus and train station. "
2702,Staff and volunteers are on hand. All wearing clearly marked t shirts. I saw them preparing the areas each morning. All seemed friendly and welcoming.
2703,The Ranger was hugely helpful
2704,"It was really easy to get around the hotel in my powerchair, corridors restaurant etc.,
When we were staying there one of the lifts was out of action which caused queues to get into the list most of the time.
One annoying feature was the height at which the reception desks was at.  I had to get my daughter to use the card machine to pay the account, which was annoying.
One other thing that annoyed me was the softness of the pillows, but perhaps  I ought to have asked if they had firmer ones."
2705,The restaurant was very busy on the night I visited and staff helped me find an outdoor table.
2706,"The entrance, reception and bar is really accessible and with good signage to the lifts etc.  "
2707,"Very small carpark with only one official disabled spot. Bit of a slope and a big gate to enter the Ponds, so a lone wheelchair user would need assistance. "
2708,Good ramp not sloppy in rain
2709,There are accessible toilets with handrails available near the entrance to the castle 
2710,"Well ramped where needed, accessible dining room,"
2711,"Staff were very welcoming and friendly. I spoke to the person on the reception desk, who was very helpful in providing me with directions to the accessible toilet. I also told her that I was doing a review for Euan's Guide and we had a discussion about the good access round the museum and she made a note about the Wellcome's Changing Places toilet and my comments about having seating with back support and arms. I felt there was a genuine wish to be accessible and inclusive."
2712,The shop is on Princes Street - no parking there.
2713,We arrived by car and visited the visitor centre first. Some handy blue badge parking spaces were very close to the main entrance. We discovered that you could drive to the Burns cottage and also park in handy accessible spaces by the entrance.
2714,"The staff are wonderfully friendly and keen to be helpful. The very sweet man who fetched the planks of wood for me had worked hard to find a solution to let me in. One star lost because they really should have thought things through better and bought a wheelchair ramp by now, well over twenty years after it became a legal obligation to give access to disabled people."
2715,"Visitor's Centre with  café serving hot and cold drinks, soup and sandwiches and cakes.   Disabled access.  Outdoor activity Centre including Disabled sailing Centre.  Bike hire,  3 wheelers available.   Country walks and natural wildlife.  Lots of swans and ducks to feed.
Contact centre for further information.   01505 842882 or check the website clydemuirsiel.co.uk"
2716,"Glass fronted main entrance is step free and takes you into the ticket desk. Most of the museum is on the ground floor, with some side rooms. There is a lift to the other floors. There is a garden which is nicely laid out with gravel paths. The information in the museum is in French.  I was given a A4 booklet in English, standard size print, with information about many of the exhibits. "
2717,"Attended for COVID booster and flu jab.
Well organised , and smooth flow through the procedures.
Boosted by army personnel supporting nursing staff to administer vaccinations "
2718,New built hotel Premier Inn with a restaurant attached in Bristol city centre. 
2719,"There was no wheelchair access toliet near the Penge Gate, and the normal toilets were old and rudimentary."
2720,To access the cinema for a wheelchair user the easiest place to park is in the level 3 car park as it is situated just by the cinema lifts. There are plenty of disabled car parking spaces on that level. People can access the cinema by other means of transport for example the bus which is not too far from the Intu Centre.
2721,We were met by Kim on arrival who was extremely friendly and helpful.  All staff we met during our stay were exceptional -a real asset. 
2722,"Lifts to get to other platform is lovely and Big, the drawbacks at this station is the height of doors on trains away from platforms and when you get to platform 7(seven) at Chester, the height away from platform is even bigger as is the gap"
2723,"There is a disabled toilet located to the back of the cafe. However the space where the toilets are located slightly cramped as there is only one other toilet,  however it is manageable to get to and from if need be. "
2724,Step free access. Two sets of double doors which wheelchair users may require assistance with. One good accessible loo available. Plenty space and different heights of tables/seating available.
2725,Norsey Woods has an easy access trail which takes you through the bluebell woods. It doesn't cover most of the woods but is certainly enough if you are pushing a wheelchair. Norsey Woodland Crafts are based next to the visitor centre and are open on Sundays and other days depending largely on what they are doing. They sell lots of rustic crafted wood items such as toadstools and planters but also DIY kits for children to take home and make funny woodland faces.  Don't miss the large zoetrope in the exhibition room.
2726,Adjacent to rail station and on a bus route. Ample parking at the chapel. 
2727,There were 2 disabled toilets and changing areas/showers were included in the main changing room.  These were all easy to find and there were grab rails. There were no hoists.
2728,All access needs met.
2729,Changing places facilities and disabled toilets available but need to take lift to basement cafe to access. Additional accessible loo hidden away at back of 4th floor main gallery space - assistance needed to access two sets of doors and may be inaccessible at times when displays being changed.
2730,"There are two accessible toilets. One on the top and one on the bottom floor. Both pretty easy to find. The toilet on the top floor is located beside the cafe and the one on the bottom is located in the changing area, outside of the sports hall. There are signs informing you of this. Both toilets are very spacious with grab rails and reachable emergency cords."
2731,"Can't comment on the parking. Don't try to get there by Metro - the nearby stations are not wheelchair accessible. Paris buses all have ramp access. We used a 69 bus to get to the Champ de Mars, from where it is a short wheel or walk to the western end of the promenade. The 63 bus route runs parallel to the walk. Be careful to check on-line whether the bus stop you intend to use is wheelchair accessible. A few are not, including the 69 stop at the Musée d'Orsay. "
2732,"Kerith Centre has a dropped kerb & level access. Access to all ground floor areas is good, with no steps, but no lift. 
K2 has level access with a lift to the first floor."
2733,Faultless in that there are two accessible parking bays right outside the main entrance. Buses also pass along the adjacent road and there is ample space for taxis to drop people off at the door. If arriving as a pedestrian the building is clearly sign posted with large notices and floor graphics.
2734,"The staff were very anxious to help and make us feel welcome, they could not have done any more and were really lovely.  This greatly contributed to the overall relaxed and laid-back atmosphere in the cafe and reflected Glastonbury at its inclusive, non-judgemental open to everyone and everything best!"
2735,Drinks order taken promptly and served soon after.  Food order taken shortly after drinks arrived.  Food arrived quite quickly.  It was noticeable that no staff came to enquire how we were enjoying the meal.  The two staff were fully employed in the main dining area.  The disabled friendly section was desserted apart from my carer and myself which made us feel a little neglected.  Staff were however friendly when you did see them.  Things could well be different on a busier day.  No background music meant there was no atmosphere.
2736,"Good, clean disabled loo. Changing Places toilet and shower."
2737,"Nearby street parking, either side of the theatre"
2738,Amazing! Very helpful and knowledgable about both the premises and the menu. 
2739,Fully accessible and spacious 
2740,"This school has automatic doors, a lift, help points and even a small wheelchair lift up to the stage areas. People in our school with disabilities are given a pass which allows them to use all of these facilities and leave class early to avoid overcrowding. Our school is newly built just a few years ago and I think that accessibility was a major point in the planning."
2741,"There was signs directing you to the nearby toilets, there was also enough space to move about in the loo for both the stalls and the disabled toilets,  also grab rails present in the disabled loo, toilets were also well cleaned prior to use. Available space was present for carer in the toilet, changing area was located on the same floor."
2742,Public conveniences in main car park next to disabled parking spaces. Steps to negotiate
2743,We parked round the corner in S. College Street with blue badge.
2744,Le Negresco Hotel is a 5 star luxury hotel on the Prom des Anglais. My review is for Christmas dinner at their Le 37 Pop restaurant. 
2745,"Jarlshof Prehistoric and Norse Settlement is a prehistoric archaeological site that lies near the southern tip of the Shetland Mainland. It has been in Shetland for over 4,000 years of human history. We visited out of season, so it was very quiet, only a few children running around. The signage wasn’t very good to know where you could pay for entry so we just wandered through.

There is also a hotel called ‘Sumburgh Hotel’ is on the grounds of Jarlshof Prehistoric and Norse Settlement."
2746,"I did not see it, but my friend was satisfied"
2747,Very close to Waverly station.
2748,"Accessible fun! A Sailability session, run by Innovate Trust,"
2749,Always found staff very friendly in Braehead. Especially the mobility staff members.
2750,"Flat access to get through wide front doors, through reception, down a long shallow ramp to get into the main part of the museum. Lots of space around the exhibits but it can get busy so give yourself plenty of time. There are plenty of lifts throughout.  Try the IMAX theater which shows 3D movies - wheelchair access is via a staff lift but the staff bent over backwards to help. Wheelchair seating at the back of the theater with large gaps for wheelchairs and buggies alongside a small number of regular seats for the family."
2751,"From the promenade there is step free access. There is a wide open entrance. The pier has wooden planks. Apart from one part where there is a slope/ ramp, see photo, the rest of the pier is level. There are various stalls/ shops selling food and gifts with manual doors. There is plenty of seating. "
2752,The overall rating is very good as it never gets that busy and the staff are really easy to talk to. 
2753,"There is an accessible toilet in the crypt, which is accessible via a lift or stairs. It's spacious and clean with grab rails. The emergency cord was short (sorry forgot to bring my red Euan's cord cards with me that day). There is a sign on the wall saying ""the light in the toilet automatically switches off after 5 minutes and I wasn't sure where you could switch it back on. "
2754,"Fantastic access - Courts 1 and 2 particularly, more so than Centre Court for sightlines. Would absolutely recommend it. "
2755,only spoke to one member of staff in the change kiosk who was fine and changed some money for us to play the machines
2756,"Great access throughout, big ramp down into the entrance, lifts available, ramps used throughout the building. The Hockney was on one level, throughout the exhibition and seats where provided in the rooms."
2757,"The toilet in the bathroom has one shaky grab rail, but it was not possible for me to get in/out of the bathroom without assistance - no space to manoeuvre , and steep narrow ramps to get to the bathroom

public toilet in  the basement accessed by lift.  Plenty of space, grab rails etc."
2758,Appeared ok. I did not have any problems
2759,Parking and public transport is amazing a Trafford centre with plenty of disabled parking bays 
2760,"The hotel staff appeared well trained in customer service and where witnessed going out of their way to assist all guests in a non-discriminatory manner. They appeared to be sensitive to the needs of all guests, both those staying at the hotel and those using the facilities. The lowered section of the reception desk insures guests in wheelchairs are still able to communicate and engage effectively with staff without a physical barrier."
2761,Staff are very helpful
2762,"Access into the building is easy and convenient with automatic doors and permanent wide ramps with railings throughout the garden centre including the cafe. There is currently a one way system in place due to the Covid restrictions which takes you to the outside area via some steps, there was a member of staff in the area who was able to redirect us through using the usual ramp, he also asked others to allow us the 2m space to get through."
2763,Apart from buying my ticket for the exhibition and showing my ticket at the entrance I had no interaction with the staff. They were polite.
2764,"Wide automatic doors into the building.
T-loops for hearing aids were advertised at the checkouts but wasn't switched on/wasn't working"
2765,"car park on a level and first mile and half or so of roadway accessible by electric buggy and possibly wheelchair, but after that there are greater inclines which would be more testing forelectric buggy or wheelchair. You can hire (from the bike hire place in car park) two seater buggieswhich would make the roadway considerably more accessible. Thinking pre-booking be wise as only saw two buggies. Restaurant reached by a very small lift – okay for a wheelchair (just) but not an electric buggy. Once inside restaurant fairly accessible. Gift shop difficult to get in to and crowded"
2766,"Access was pretty good! We encountered step-free access, friendly staff and although it's a little tight for space, it's easy enough to shift the furniture a little. Service is at the counter, but there were plenty of staff around to assist if required."
2767,The public toilets beside the harbour do have a disabled toilet. The  toilet itself is tight for space but manageable with help.
2768,Easy to use nice big space
2769,A lovely wee place run by two very nice ladies.
2770,No signage. Lift in the evening seems to not be in use so makes getting to other terminal so you can a taxi a nightmare. No signage at all.
2771,"We recently stayed for a week from 23/9/17 at Edward and Marion’s holiday cottage - Valley View - at Thatch Close near Llangrove, Wye Valley."
2772,"Lifts, but no Braille signs. There was a sign which said “No Dogs In This Station”. So, what about guide dogs?"
2773,Next door at the omni centre.. Didn't park this time as we stayed over but have used before 
2774,Happy to help
2775,"all the staff were friendly, professional, attentive and willing to help.
"
2776,There's an accessible toilet in the main visitor centre building. 
2777,"We had a great time as the accessible rooms were better than many we have stayed in elsewhere. We loved the spacious well designed wet rooms and there were no problems manoeuvring my power chair here. The shower was really good and all the facilities easy to reach and use. the bedroom was spacious and well appointed with unexpected things like the alarm clock, the smart television, and the free wifi.

The corridors to the rooms were wide and bright; the only downside was the thickness of the carpet for wheeling over but then others would see it as being fab so we didn't mind. The bar was easily accessible with wide double doors that were either kept open or staff were happy to open - service was great as drinks were brought to our table. 

The dinning room was large and we had a choice of table with chairs being removed as required without our prompting. The service to the table from the staff was first class - nothing too much trouble - we felt very relaxed and 'at home' both during dinner and at breakfast."
2778,"The toilet was adequate for my needs, (mobility scooter) although a larger scooter user would find it a squeeze. The facilities were clean and there were paper towels soap and air freshener available"
2779,3 night trip to Greenbanks self catering Barn during Covid restrictions.
2780,Upstairs music venue is not accessible
2781,There is convenient disabled parking to the rear of the building. It is situated very close to the entrance with a gentle slope and wide automatic doors.
2782,"The only thing that could be done better is having some toilets on the ground floor as well. The toilets that are available have very good disabled access, with large standard toilets or even larger disabled toilets if needed. These are on the first floor which is accessed by going in a lift."
2783,Very friendly & happy to help if any is required.
2784,"Last minute booking for a Saturday night and we were allocated room 6 on the ground floor with 100% accessibility.  Excellent room with plenty of space to manoeuvre my mobility scooter   2 single beds with great wet room shower., bar, restaurant, and fully inclusive cooked/continental breakfast, or a takeaway breakfast box if in a hurry.  Plenty disabled parking bays, level access throughout.  Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for some idiot in the next room having a loud mobile phone communication at nearly midnight.   Staff were very friendly and supplied extra pillows no bother at all.  All for £62.  What's not to like? "
2785,I didn't enjoy my visit to this branch of Waterstones. All sorts of unpleasant difficulties right from the front door. Not recommended for wheelchair users. Too little space to manoeuvre within the shop because the display tables are so huge and the gaps between them so tiny.
2786,The store has a wide entrance and you then go to your left through automatic doors to enter the store then a quick right turn. The display units run across the store and a typical of MS or any food retailer. There is good signage in the store and the aisles were clear to move up and down.  As you would expect some items were on higher selves.
2787,Accessible loo at reception. Not at the house but big enough to manage with help.
2788,Staff were very helpful and willing to help where necessary.
2789,"I went with a group of get2gether members to Abbotsford. We didn't visit the house as the weather was too nice to go inside, so we spent quite a lot of time in the gardens and went for a coffee/snack afterwards."
2790,No disabled parking at London St Pancras Station. 
2791,We walked from Central Station for around 15 minutes to get there. There was a lot of uneven surfaces on the way there although the payment around the entrance was clear and flat. 
2792,"Level access from the street. Other customers were quick to move chairs so that we could access a table. Service is at your table, so the fact that the bar is of conventional height isn't a problem. There are also tables and chairs on the pavement for fine weather visitors."
2793,There is a disabled loo on left of main entrance.  Grab rails are white and around toilet and sink. There was a lowered mirror and hand dryer. The lock wasn't ergonomic and required some grip & strength to use. Toilet was left side transfer but there was a baby changing table next to toilet with a bin. Enough space to turn a chair. 
2794,No steps wide doors helpful owner   
2795,"I want to rate this pub higher than I can because it's affordable food and drink make it excellent. But it's accessibility doesn't make it easy to enjoy.  The entrance seems useful with a ramp from the street, but as soon as you're inside the door there are tables blocking your path.  There's no clear path around the pub or to the bar and there's no lift to get to the less busy lower and upper floors."
2796,"Getting into the visitor centre was easy with a large automated door. Once inside there was a clear main corridor off which all the facilities and services stemmed. Just inside the entrance you could turn right into the shop, ticket area and on to the paid exhibition. Going straight on you pass the education room, the toilets, the accessible toilet and then on to the large cafe area. All spacious, bright and easy to move around in.

If you then venture outside you can follow the tarmac walkway that takes you gently up toward the battlefield monuments. If you're a manual wheelchair user you may need a hand. It's a fair distance from the visitor centre to the monuments so you need to be pretty mobile. Once at the main monument the level access route takes you up a lengthy and steep ramp to get into the centre of the monument. Worth the effort as once you reach this point you walk through the core of the circular monument and the dominant and dramatic sculpture of Robert the Bruce comes into view. The surfaces around the monuments is varied but you can get up close and feel amongst the 'action'. The views and the atmosphere were fabulous!"
2797,The staff are nice and helpful but they can sometimes not be at the front desk and they can take 10 minutes to finally appear. 
2798,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced. Plenty of local buses stop close by. I took a taxi from my hotel.
2799,Helpful.
2800,"Toilets throughout the building, including a changing places toilet on the ground floor."
2801,"There is a disabled viewing platform which there needs to be some credit for, howeverduring an event like this wheelchair access is always difficult with so many crowds."
2802,"Upon arrival there are various clear signs suggesting a wheelchair friendly alternative route. There are several steps at the entrance, but an access ramp runs adjacent to these. A wheelchair user is able to see the animals and exhibitions clearly due to the transparent edging, for example the glass windows or fences. There is also an interactive area where anybody can feed and interact with the animals, with an accessible walkway for wheelchairs, push chairs etc. The signs locating the way to the animal exhibitions are large and colourful, making them easy to see. There are various cafes, all offering wheelchair access. Most have wide double doors that remain open, allowing a wheelchair to pass through easily and safely. "
2803,Flat entrance to  both buildings but small lip on entrance to cafe building.  Everywhere is wheelchair accessible 
2804,"Arbroath Harbour sounded interesting on paper but turned out to be much more when the sat nav guided us to the seaside sensation. We loved the boats, the aromatic smokeries, the strange tower, the life boat house and the great seaside atmosphere. With good parking, a handy accessible Harbourside loo, and easy wheeling around Arbroath's Harbourside was a hit with us."
2805,"Restaurant staff made sure I could get into the space where my table was and helped stow my wheelchair. Ensured we knew where the lift was etc.

Theatre staff checked I was happy to transfer and offered to remove seat if not."
2806,Right next to the bus station and plenty parking.
2807,"There are four blue badge spaces. These cannot be accessed from the main car park, so if coming from the South you should drive past the entrance to the main car park to the next opening on the right.There are  a few steps up from the main car park, although a wheelchair user could take the slightly longer way round from it by going back out on to the pavement. There is more parking across the road which is also available to the general public, so can get very busy."
2808,The Rail Assist guys seemed to be oblivious to the conditions I had and showed human behaviours Luke I was ‘putting it on’. 
2809,"The main entrance is not level access. The bell is not in a suitable position for wheelchair users, however 
at the rear of the building there is disabled access. There is a bell at a suitable position for wheelchair users, however the doors are heavy.  The second floor can be accessed through a a lift and there are also accessible toilets. A PenFriend can be obtained from Cartwright Hall for those who are visually impaired to hear visual descriptions of the different exhibitions."
2810,"I travelled to Ars en Re by bus. The no 3 bus travels from one end of Ile de Re to the other. The stop for Ars en Re is on a by pass, s 5 minute walk to the central square. The buses are coach style, with 2 doors, the front door by the driver has a sign for people with walking sticks, it's doable but has quite deep coach stairs. The middle door has a wheelchair sign. "
2811,there is a lot of activities for kids to do. you definitely need more than a day there. 
2812,When interacting with staff members they were very friendly. When I asked for a straw and side plate they brought them straight away. 
2813,Couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. They must love their job!
2814,"A coffee shop with views over the Berkshire countryside. Probably more suited to those with some mobility. Although there are no steps, the car park is not made up & there is no disabled toilet. However it is not a bad place for a coffee & cake, as well as a visit to the farm shop. "
2815,Secure parking facilities next to cottages.  Accessible buses close by.
2816,"Oliva is really nice however the rest are rude and basically throw your Ice Cream at you but lucky for me, I am a world class goalkeeper so I catch them :)"
2817,"The toilet was reasonable for an outdoor venue. There was an emergency cord but I don't know how long it would be before anyone responded as this site covers a large area and the visitor centre is not manned, although there is a chidren's nursery next door.  You need a Radar key to access it."
2818,with 7 designated parking bays on level one of the car park adjacent to the lifts
2819,Lothian buses 16 and 12 stop quite near.
2820,"There is access to a disabled toilet in the shop. It was clean and enough room for manoeuvring, enough space for a carer in the toilet. "
2821,Very helpful staff.
2822,"The staff were helpful and pleasant.
"
2823,"Only a token part star on this one as the accessible loo sign was covered by an out of use sign that bore the marks of having been there some time. In short, if caught short, you'll have to find an alternative ..."
2824,we didn't use or see the toilets to review these.
2825,"Access is generally very good. The square is mostly flat and where there are steps there are also slopes. There is a lack of drop kerbs. Often they are on one side of the road but not the other and where the exist they are lowered rather than dropped, see photo.
The square has a large park area, in which there is a Victorian Bandstand, the Maitland Rotunda and a few other monuments. There are plenty of benches, so of which are in the shade. There is a car park area near the Cricket Pitch, and where the horse drawn carriage ride, this was a little tricky to navigate with my crutch."
2826,Plentiful accessible toilets throughout the venue all with plenty of room for wheelchairs/powerchairs.
2827,"There's an official website that gives useful information including public transport information - http://www.northumberland.gov.uk/local/Parks.aspx
When visiting the area, this is my favourite place - just beautiful and perfect for the dog.  Easy to access the sand if you have robust wheels though best avoid the really dry or really wet sand.  There's a visitor centre and country park on the land side of the car park. The path round the lake is very accessible."
2828,Met the vicar (or deputy / assistant vicar if there is such a position?) briefly - seemed a very nice chap!
2829,"Paignton sea front and immediate surrounding area is flat. The main shopping centre has some high street shops plus going down to the sea front are lots of gift shops and places to eat. There is a traditional step free pier (see separate review).  There is a working harbour which is rather charming and there is level access to it. There's a lot of seating on the sea front.
It's also home to the Dartmouth Steam Railway (see separate review). There is a Vue cinema on the sea front and the Palace Theatre with step free access (see separate review) in the town centre. There are also a couple of public parks. I visited Oldway Mansion Gardens (see separate review). 
In the children's play area on the sea front there is an ability swing, which is gated and opened with a radar key."
2830,"Easy access with plenty of space to move around. Level access, wide doors, and on site toilets."
2831,Parking right at the doors with a very large car park 
2832,"This is a gtreat place even more so if you have children. They have a great fenced in play area which is only accesable through the resturant. They also have a really good deli, a little shop and a great micro brewery all under one roof. The food is good and there is loads of space. It should be a spectacular review and it would be if they could get the service right. I have been twice now and the service is amateurish. To sit you down and not give you a drinks menu is a schoolboy error. The staff spend most of their time by the kitchen which is out of sight from the main dining area. They forget a lot of stuff. For example half our drinks order (once we were finally able to place one). On my first visit they didn't tell me that they had no fish and chips until half an hour after I had ordered it!

If they could get the service right I would give it ten out of ten."
2833,Level access into the cafe. Plenty low tables with moveable seats. Great accessible loo. Has a lowered counter but was covered in stock unfortunately. Loses a point for this and the slightly tight entrance to the loos.
2834,In front of centre.
2835,Driving around Bath is generally difficult.  We were lucky on our visit to find disabled parking spaces near places we wanted to visit.  There are a number of larger car parks with disabled spaces
2836,"Toilet was male/female/disabled.  Double door allowed wheelchair access.  One support handrail, right side"
2837,"Whilst on holiday in Washington DC we crossed the Potomac river and drove to George Washington’s Mount Vernon. There was no obvious disabled parking bays at the visitors centre at the entrance so my dad dropped us off and parked in the car park. Inside the centre there were security checks and toilets. Before watching a short film about the history of Mount Vernon and George Washington we had a look at the miniature replica of the house and the stained glass windows (see photos). After the film we walked outdoors to George Washington’s house(see photos).It was busy and we had to queue before getting inside the house. Despite it being April it was a little chilly. The ground floor level is wheelchair accessible but the upper floors were not. As a consolation there was a little booklet with pictures showing the contents and use of the upper floors. After viewing the house we could have gone to Washington’s tomb but decided not to as it was quite a distance away and the weather was still a little cold. Instead we went to see the slave quarters. It was wheelchair accessible and all the information boards where low enough to read (see photos). Then we went back to the visitors centre where there was lots of information ( in different formats eg text, audio and visual) about George Washington and his life from birth to death.
 Inside the visitors centre fast food was available and the dining area was wheelchair accessible. We had pizza 🍕. There is also a spacious large accessible gift shop.
Although there were a few inaccessible areas and parts we didn’t go to the visit was very interesting and well done.
If you are interested in American history it is definitely the place for you. 
I think the best time would probably be in the summer."
2838,"Staff attendance at the toilets was poor. When reporting to the information desk as advised for assistance to board the train the service was poor. Simply told to make my way to the platform and someone would come and assist. Went to platform, nobody appeared and again fellow travellers helped by going and getting help. Help to board was grudgingly provided."
2839,It was table service and this was fine.
2840,Couldn't get an closer if you tried! Parking was right by the front door.
2841,plenty of parking 
2842,We booked the boat for a 2 hour trip for Mum's birthday. Great trip and great staff. An amazing service to let the less-abled access the canal.
2843,Friendly guides who didn't fuss but ensured I could cross roads as necessary and see the buildings too even when surrounded by other people walking with them.   The buildings in my home town never fail to amaze me - so much history but lots of it is by looking up!  Try it for yourself.
2844,Good public toilet outside the public park.
2845,Didn't need any assistance but saw smiling staff around the station.
2846,"We arrived to have to face decision where you have to park, there is a very narrow car park entrance with most drivers having to shuffle around to get into, so we chose next entrance through wood work shop building (photo 1) and turning into the chipping area to park up, where there are no disabled bays
It is however a very attractive looking single storey brick building, (photo 2) but the downside is that the ramp is on the far side to get in, over very difficult thick 
chipping car park, quite a pull for carer, and extremely difficult to push. The doorway is narrow (photo 3) with a small ramp like step, but difficult.
Once inside the brilliantly lit shop, there are a number of rooms, in a long line, (photo 4) each one through a doorway, but easy enough as now on the level, but it is a delightful place to walk around, furniture, lightening, (photo 5) ornaments and other items to see which were all beautiful, but very expensive. There are doorways, (photo 6)  but gave us no trouble, and large card department (photo 7) 
The furniture section had a very small step (photo 8) but again no real problem, and then the very appealing cafe, (photo 9) unfortunately with steps, and we saw no ramp. The toilet come disabled use, has a raised seat, with rails on each side, (photo 10) but no pull cord.
Our final thoughts
What a delightful place, so interesting, with classy furnishings, expensive ornaments that really appealed, well lit up, and a pleasure to move around. 
But sadly, it’s not disabled friendly, we certainly feel it’s not suitable for scooters or a power chair, from the first hard pull over chipping on the car park to reach wooden ramp, which may be slippery if raining, and a few niggley little steps, but if you can manage as I did,  it was a pleasurable time to look around, and we really enjoyed our visit.
"
2847,"The toilet facilities are in the nearby Center from the outside, accessible by ramps and lifts, there was visible fordirection and location. Radar key accessible, with a Euan's Guide red cord card visible. Fully equipped toilet, though as with the vast majority no pegs to hang a jacket of coat."
2848,"This castle is on the coast of East Neuk. Its not accessible but I found if I walked slowly and had my personal handrail, it wasn't too daunting."
2849,"All the staff I encountered were helpful, and seemed genuinely concerned about the problems I pointed out. 

Two stars deducted for the staff who have permitted the various annoying items above to exist and persist."
2850,"Car parking very close by, within 20 meters of entrance"
2851,"You can find on-road parking at the top of the park, but it’s worth knowing that there is dedicated disabled parking at the bottom end, off Ecclesall Road (opposite the entrance to Berkeley Precinct). If none is available there, you can drive into the park itself, where there are 2 or 3 disabled spaces on the left. "
2852,"There are two entrances, both are easily accessible for wheelchairs and other mobility aids from the street. There are two levels inside - one is slightly raised but steps and a ramp allow ease of access to this dining area. There is plenty of space between tables and around them meaning it is very easy to navigate"
2853,"Very friendly, can be a bit OTT with the Italian flare! But nothing really is a problem! They also make a good cocktail!"
2854,"Lots of accessible bays immediately in front of the centre. Around 6 in total, with some additional parent and child spaces."
2855,Friendly and helpful.
2856,Good parking. easy access with wheelchair into centre from car park.
2857," The cafe very large and spacious so it's easy to get about in a wheelchair.  In the upstairs room displays, most would not be large enough to access in a powerchair or larger manual chair, but I did manage to get in and around a few displays. This is understandable since they are showing compact living, but it would be nice to have at least one accessible display for each room type. "
2858,"Once you go in the corner gate take the path along the side of the church and turn left and enter via double doors. Once through these door you are in a passageway that connects the church and hall area. 
Turn left at these doors and you face another set of double doors once through these the pulpit area is on your left. 
This area is made up of individual seats that can be moved about to suit requirements  or to give extra wheelchair space. 
If you turn right at the doors you entered by there are 6 steps up to the hall there is a small wheelchair lift available to use to access this area"
2859,"There is some step free indoor seating and another area which has about five steps with a hand rail to get to, the downstairs area is quieter as there is no TV and is away from the main bar. There is also some step free outdoor seating. Tables and chairs are free standing."
2860,On street parking and disabled spaces across the road. 
2861,A spacious car park with a dedicated disabled bay.
2862,"There were many steps enabling people to explore upstairs and downstairs in the shopping centre. The steps had two lanes for those going up and for those going down and were certainly spacious. On this particular day the lift was out of order which could be particularly inconvenient, there were no signs to where the nearest lift was from that point either."
2863,There is an accessible toilet just before the barriers to the main toilet area. It is opened by a staff member or can be opened with a RADAR key. It's clean and fairly spacious although it does require a tight ninety degree turn to access the door.
2864,"Both the room and the bathroom were very spacious, with lots of room for the wheelchair.
In the room, there was a small table that one could use for reading the paper, working at a laptop or Ipad,  Fine for me, bity no other seat for my wife.  I suppose I could have used my wheelchair. Unfortunately during our three night stay we could not work out the heating system, despite instructions on the wall.  I am sure that had we asked at reception, someone would have given instructions."
2865,The toilets had grab rails and had good space. 
2866,"All the staff we did meet were excellent, highly trained and polite, who did what they could to help us, going beyond what they should have done, and we were grateful for their support."
2867,"Plenty of space for any wheelchair user with most equipment available at time of booking, the freedom of movement downstairs is good with large adjoining wet room! With a separate toilet as well.
Stairs to upper level bedroom with bathroom and shower off landing."
2868,I had a fantastic Valentines dinner at this venue. Access was so level and toilets were great (the sliding door was a highlight). Due to roadworks and transport disruption it is a pain to get to in car/on buses.
2869,"Lovely accommodation, everything we needed we had organised for oxygen To be  delivered and John and Jan were so helpful  lovely holiday thank you"
2870,"The Beacon is adjacent to Eastbourne train station and easy to find. On the street outside there are currently road works going on which means that some of the road is fenced off and there are limited crossing points. However, I will still give access 5 as this is temporary and the pavement outside is wide and the area is flat, so once the road works are over it should be easy to navigate. The taxi rank is close by, near the station."
2871,There is no free parking available at Kyra and paid parking is limited on St Saviourgate as it is in the centre of York.  The venue is close to the bus stops at Stonebow in York and has a taxi rank at the end of the street.
2872,"Very nice restaurant with lovely food. There is wheelchair access via a seperate door which takes you to a slightly higher level. You need to book and advice them that you have a wheelchair. There is a disabled toilet that can be used which is on a balcony level, accessed by a lift. Staff will show you the toilet and unlock it. "
2873,"As mentioned, random stones make part of the trail quite bumpy so difficult to recommend this site unless you are adventurous and/or not bothered by a bumpy surface."
2874,"lowered kerbs
clearly marked parking bays and they are wide enough
parking bays close to entrance"
2875,"Wheelchair access, completely step-free, is excellent. You may well struggle to get into the Cathedral though, because on the day I visited the main entrance on the Borough Market side was locked up and the West Door entrance has several steps. You have to work your way round to the café courtyard to find step-free entrances. After that it's easy, there are permanent stone ramps in the aisles and staff will deploy a fine long metal ramp (see picture below) for the several steps leading up to the east end of the cathedral. Someone had thoughtlessly left some heavy clutter at the end of one of the stone ramps (see picture below). There is a good platform lift to take you from the café level to the cathedral level."
2876,"We took the euro star from London direct to Paris then took a taxi to the hotel, this was only a short 10/15 minute journey"
2877,Great for pubic transport 
2878,Very large accessible toilet on ground floor.........very spacious for maneuvering wheelchair and space for carer too.
2879,Not marked but easy to find once we were directed. It's just on the other side of the hall.
2880,"On approach you'll probably see the pop up cafes just outside the main entrance and the book shop. These have canvas awnings to help protect you from the elements! The main entrance is well signposted and you go through this entering into a fantastic courtyard! There are several different areas centred around a giant screen and stage - this worked really well in showing what was going on I really enjoyed watching events on the big screen. Seems like lots of other people did this too and there was a grassy bank to sit on as well as viewing areas and some picnic tables too. 

There is a slope in the courtyard down to the main auditoriums and the children's area. We checked out the children's area which had some great features for kids and was accessible with a ramp to get into the area itself.

The bar was to your right as you entered the courtyard and was an accessible deck with canvas awning. If you carried on past the bar you enter a permanent building which is the cafe and also housed the loos.

The Book Shop is in it's own building, an old fire station with amazing high ceiling. Bookshelves look great in there and although there are some tables dotted around they added to the whole experience rather than cluttering things up unnecessarily. The different sections are clearly labelled and there were plenty of staff around if you needed to ask for help. 

The only thing I was sad about was that I didn't get to attend any in person events - but this was because I wasn't fast enough when booking opened!"
2881,The disabled loo itself is reasonably spacious with a grab rail on the right side. Doubles as baby changing area so there is a table in the corner. My daughter had no problem moving around in the loo however the small corridor outside is a bit tight and she had to back into the entrance of the men's loo to be able to open the door in to the restaurant. Apart from that she managed well. An easy fix would be to rehang the door from restaurant to toilet corridor the other way.
2882,"Getting in with my powerchair was easy with a push pad style automated door. Plenty of circulation space inside, bright and light. A dropped counter makes speaking to people easier."
2883,"Not bad - big enough to get a small scooter inside, a reasonable selection of rails and clean when I used it. There's just the one, though, so it's going to be under pressure on busy days."
2884,"Lovely -if a bit jaded- loo.  All necessary grab rails and alarm cord. Nice wide doorway, clearly labelled, plenty of room to turn a chair inside."
2885,"Once over the entrance threshold which is shared with the neighbouring shop (a lip, not a step, and it's very shallow but care needed as there's a loose tile), the door opens easily inwards. Floors are smooth, wooden and easy to roll on. I had a wheeled walker which was stable and easy to push - care might be needed with crutches or sticks. There are no steps - a ramp negotiates the change in level to the wash basins.  Chairs were a decent height for getting in and out of. Plenty of room to manoeuvre."
2886,Perfect
2887,"When I booked I noted that seating was on a first come first served basis, which I would struggle with, so I contacted the organisers and they replied promptly and positively. Then later there was even a follow up email. This meant when I arrived I was given priority to enter the room and thereby avoided queuing.
Staff at Pankhurst House reception desk were friendly and proactive in assisting me through the entry gates."
2888,"You'll find ramp access to the city walls at Bank Place directly across from the Metro Bar.  Bank Place is just on the left after passing under Shipquay Gate approaching from the direction of the Guildhall.

Steps on some sections of the walls are steep so you need to be careful if you are visually impaired."
2889,Toilets are the disabled access bathrooms in the paisley centre itself
2890,"Mostly volunteers, and they are all friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. There is a small team who man the disabled campsite, as well as the disabled access viewing platforms, and they are really helpful. There is also a staffed medical centre on site and ambulances available."
2891,"Next to a canal and road. Pub, restaurant, camping field, caravan site, on site hairdressers/beauty salon, launderette and camp/village shop. Popular with locals, tourists, boaters and motorcyclists.
Helpful staff, good food and drink make up for some of the old buildings failings. 
A nice touch for those not ""drinking"", is free refills of tea, coffee and soda water with cordial."
2892,"Disabled bays are quite close to hotel with level approaches, a pull handle door leads into hotel, and it’s level all way to the Spa, which is on ground floor"
2893,Easily accessible near cafe. Not massive but certainly large enough for Wheelchair/Scooter.
2894,"We had an accessible room, where the bathroom facilities were excellent - wetroom, grab rails, folding shower seat, low level wash basin, etc."
2895,"All spa patrons are given the loan of towelling dressing gowns and flip flops. There are different sized gowns and towelling slippers if flip flops won't stay on your feet. They will give disabled visitors as many towels as they need and extra ones or fresh gowns for lunch time. 
I needed to ask for body lotion as there wasn't any automatically in the changing room.
There weren't special bins for pads or catheter or stoma bags.
I recommend that you wear your swimming costume under your clothes to make it easier and quicker to change when you arrive. (Just remember your underwear!!)
The disabled changing room was fine as there was only one disabled patron, but had I had to share it with a friend or someone else, I might have had to sit in cold wet togs for a long time or I might have got very tired waiting in the spa until they were ready. 
There is no changing table or hoist, but there are drop down hand rails next to the toilet and shower and grab rails by the sink and shower too. There is a drop down shower seat without arms.
The floor got quite wet and slippery  as the shower drained slower and the slope of the floor was marginal compared to mine. However they said they would look into the issue.
There are lockers which need a four figure code Which you need to remember."
2896,"Lots of Blue Badge spaces in each inside car park and directions to cinema clearly signed. Lifts at each car park and level access from there to the venue. Bus stops outside the building (flat access). Ask taxi to drop you at ""the outside car park where Debenhams used to be"" and you'll enter the building with the lift straight ahead of you."
2897,Usually one or two folk on doing everything. But they are helpful 
2898,There was a lift very close. We didn't see many signs.
2899,"The hotel had fantastic access, ramps both in and out of the hotel which weren't steep at all, the lifts were also of reasonable size and could easily have fitted a larger wheelchair in no problem. The room was located on the 6th floor beside a fire exit, away from the hustle and bustle of other guests which was rather nice. It was of reasonable size and spacious, easy enough to navigate around in my wheelchair without getting stuck. The bathroom was a wet-room of reasonable size again easy enough to navigate around and had a number of grab rails located throughout. The sink was also at a lower level which was easy reach from my wheelchair."
2900,Beautiful modern gallery which is very easy to enjoy from a wheelchair
2901,"The sign for the toilet was clear, and when heading in that direction, a staff member ensured that an individual from our group was heading in the right direction highlighting how friendly the staff were on our visit. Access to all toilets at this venue is flat with a disabled toilet also being available for use. During our visit, all the individuals visiting the toilet did not require the disabled toilet therefore I am unable to comment on the availability of facilities such as grab rails, however the toilet was of good size. "
2902,"The restaurant is upstairs in the shopping centre, a lift and wheelchair lift are required to get up."
2903,Take the wheelchair accessible bus up Madison Avenue and get off at 74th  Street.
2904,"On a sunny day there are few things more pleasurable than st-rolling by the sea. At Scarborough there is a 3 and half mile flat tarmac path than runs by the edge of the sea and sand with excellent views. If the tide is out there are ramps that lead down to hard packed sand in the South Bay, if you don't mind risking a bit of sand and salt in your wheels. The walk can be as long as a 7 mile round trip or a short roll down the harbough to the light house where there are lots of benches to enjoy the view. The Regal Lady, a 'pleasure steamer', can accommodate wheelchairs on the top deck  (the ramp gets steeper when the tide is lower)."
2905,"The nearest bus stop is on The Avenue, opposite Leonard Horner Hall. There is no parking directly at the venue, however, parking is on street nearby. The nearest car park with designated blue badge bays is located at the Centre for Sports and Exercise opposite the University main reception/bus terminal, however, this is a few minutes away and has a steep hill between it and the Union building, so is unlikely to be especially suitable."
2906,A fairly good number of Blue Badge parking spaces and we managed to get parked fine and there was plenty of room to get my wheelchair out of the car and for me to transfer.
2907,The staff at the entrance gate let our taxi through. At the palace there was a person on the ticket desk. I didn't see any staff while walking round the house.
2908,"From the pavement on George IV Bridge there are two wide doors which open inwards. I'm a vandal so I just drive the scooter at the door to open it, although to be honest the staff are so switched on they usually seem to sense me coming and open the door.

There are various tables at differing heights, with plenty of room between them."
2909,Not great
2910,Tivoli is right in the city centre by the main railway station. There are also a number of buses that stop close by the entrance. The buses are accessible and drivers were helpful. 
2911,"Various lifts were out of order although I was prewarned of this on arrival. I think I also came across another that was broke. Most of the materials are at eye level whilst using a wheelchair and the maps are easy to read. Some of the lifts are a bit small and sometimes bit of a challenge with the amount of pushchairs out and about.

The toilets would have benefited from being better signposted."
2912,Possibly the best we have experienced.
2913,"My disabled brother and I have made our second visit to this wonderful facility for the disabled.  Valley View cottage, a ground floor cottage,  is fully accessible and can be interconnected with two other cottages, making it available for complete families to enjoy the experience of the surrounding area. Edward and Marian are friendly and willing to help with all aspects to make life easy for a wheelchair user.  Nothing is too much trouble which takes away the strain of holidaying with wheelchair user.  Lots of facilities on site: eg BBQ, laundry and chairs and tables to enjoy the view of the countryside.  

We cannot recomment this place highly enough for a wheelchair user."
2914,The staff were very nice and extremely helpful. My Mobility Scooter fell over on the way traveling back as the van was moving around a lot and staff were good and lifted me back up.
2915,there were very few staff around
2916,"Since using a wheelchair, this is one of the best places I've been to for accessibility. We visited on a Saturday afternoon and there was plenty of parking with a street level entrance through automatic doors. (We did struggle paying for parking as the machine didn't work very well, I would take exact change in case there is no attendant available!). Staff were very helpful and knowledgeable when we were inside. Every part of the building was fully accessible and there were several disabled toilets."
2917,"Parking was not easy partly due to roadworks which made the nearby disabled parking bays impossible to use. Instead I and others where dropped off outside the restaurant while my dad the driver hunted for a space. Luckily due to the fact that I have a disabled blue parking badge he manage to park a short distance away on George Street. 
There are plenty of bus stops in close proximity is to the restaurant and Waverley train station is close. Another option is of course the Edinburgh tram which is also very close.
"
2918,Overall easy peasy! Some might find a little bit of a problem with a rather small narrow lifts..
2919,Couldn’t see why I was upset about things like no emergency evacuation plan. Or removing my wheelchair bags. Or using the toilet with the door open. They did give us our money back. 
2920,"The entrance is step free and there is a modern lift to all floors. The lift is surprisingly cramped and there is no room for a wheelchair user to turn around inside it - you may want to roll in backwards to make your exit easier. The lift is also agonisingly slow: if there were prizes for lift slowness, this one would be a winner. The book display tables are arranged very inconsiderately for wheelchair users. They are so close together, and close to shelving, that many sections of the bookshop cannot be reached in a wheelchair - the gaps are too narrow. Because the tables are heavily stacked with books, it's not possible to shove them out of the way."
2921,"There is plenty of parking in the attached car parks with designated disabled parking. The Centre is next to both Stratford International and Stratford Regional Stations. These give accessible access to the High Speed One railway service, the accessible Jubilee Line and the Docklands Light Railway."
2922,There is a lift and there's lots of space to move around inside.  Disabled visitors get a reduced entrance fee and carers get in free. level access and lifts throughout
2923,No problem at all.
2924,Great staff!  They told me everything they were doing and when and they were very friendly.
2925,"The toilet was good, with one omission, the door open inwards, which would prove a problem for a larger wheelchair."
2926,"Fantastic wee spot, great for exploring the Fife area. We had 2 dogs and they had a very happy break. Good wheelchair and dog friendly outdoor walks all around - we had never been to the Tentsmuir Trust but it is huge and peaceful. We know the area so only had 1 day in towns and 4 days outdoors. Other holidaymakers were exploring Edinburgh and Perthshire - so many accessible venue choices nearby for sure!The cottages can be hired for weekends, week days or for the full 7. Loved our whole experience of staying at Homelands Trust and we will definitely return. Very low price and super staff."
2927,"Lovely comfortable fully accessible accommodation in a beautiful peaceful setting.  Hamiltons is one of five properties in Eildon holiday Cottages.  There are othe accessible properties in the steading for larger party's. Hamiltons is  a very spacious one bedroom cottage great for wheelchair users.   Would definitely come back, hopefully bring family next tiime as I know they would love it.  "
2928,The staff were helpful and very accommodating to our dietary requirements.
2929,We were dropped off outside as limited parking on the street. Close to city centre for busses. About a 10 min walk from the train station.
2930,"I drove and parked in car park, there are plenty of disabled bays to park in but I am fortunate enough to be mobile and don't need one. Train station and bus stops nearby too."
2931,"Can't comment on the parking. Karlsplatz U Bahn Station (fully accessible) is very close but the lift brings you out in what seemed like the wrong place. The safest route is to exit the station concourse in the direction away from the concert hall then turn left and walk through the gardens. Turn left into an underpass which takes you under the main road and you will find a lift that takes you up about 100 yards from the Musikverein, with no roads to cross."
2932,"There was an accessible toilet in the ground floor foyer. It was located in between the regular toilets. The accessible toilet required a radar key. I personally don't like the accessible toilet being kept locked inside a public building, especially as there was plenty of staff in the foyer, checking tickets, at the box office, security staff and people serving at the refreshment counter, there could be regular checks to keep an eye on the toilet. There was also an accessible toilet on the 4th floor near the auditorium, this did not require a radar key and given the isolation of the toilet I would feel this one was more likely to be abused than the one in the foyer. Both toilets were spacious, clean, with grab rails and the emergency cord reached to the floor."
2933,"Wheelchair accessible shops and restaurants, plenty of blue badge parking"
2934,"All Harry Potter fans will know about Platform 9 3/4 at Kings Cross Station!
Due to popular demand, even Muggles can now visit this, and a themed shop too."
2935,"The pub is reasonably central - just over the bridge from Debenhams and the main shopping centre. Guildford's bus and train stations are a little way from the pub but there are public car parks nearby, with Blue Badge spaces."
2936,Easy to access disabled toilet
2937,"No steps an on an even level for wheelchairs.
I needed help with the main door.
I could see the food available but I couldn't reach for everything and the serving desk was quite high up.
Plenty of seating and table options."
2938,The service station is level and has dropped kerbs at points you cross over the main building is level through out
2939,"Essentially cricket training and spectating venue with entertaining space separate hired out to public, when doing so spectators / parents have to use the disabled WC as access to public wcs is on 1st floor which is where the entertainment hall is. Hence queue for Wc, as numerous parents/ siblings use disabled Wc. They can’t use the ones on the changing rooms due to safeguarding policy, which is totally understandable but to remove access to the public ones on first floor is ludicrous and puts unacceptable volume through the disabled Wc. It was pointed out there are 2 disabled wcs. So I suggested two disabled persons wouldn’t need use at the same time? Also, second disabled Wc is through a set of heavy hinged fire doors.
Disabled bays constantly used by others or People park at top of the pedestrian slope preventing chair access so they can wheel their sports equipment down"
2940,"The accessible bathroom was spacious and I was able to move around easily. The sink was perfect as I was able to roll my wheelchair underneath without banging my knees. The position of the toilet was good - space on one side for wheelchair transferring. There was fold down grab bars for support. The roll-in shower also had grab bars, but unfortunately, there wasn’t a fixed shower seat or bench in the shower, but there was just a portable seat. The shower tray has the potential to be slippery, so I’d recommend you take care if standing in the shower.  "
2941,"The accessible toilet is accessed from the main library by going through two doors. It is clean, spacious and equipped with grab rails."
2942,Start could not be more helpful.
2943,The entrance has a small lip which was fairly easy for me to get over but could be problematic for others. There is plenty of floor space but there are usually a number of chairs which can make this difficult to navigate. 
2944,"Many buses serve this store so it's easy to get here, there are very large car parks too so it won't be a problem getting a space here."
2945,I would say the access is quite good. There are two doors at the entrance which are not automatic and could definetly benefit from being automatic.
2946,The few we met seemed to be very pleasant and easy with us.
2947,"The Toilets are very easy too use 
There is Emergency pull cord that goes all the way to the floor so it would be easy to use in case of emergency 
The toilet is big and wide enough to fit a wheelchair in with no stress at all in my option   "
2948,"I am having trouble describing this venue but a must visit if you're interested in architecture and design. It's a museum, gallery, library and information point to name but a few! Level access throughout and spacious. The one small drawback is a relatively small lift where if you have more than one wheelchair you must go one at a time. There is one viewing area that can be accessed by lift and get a view across the city, the other is up a set of stairs."
2949,Really nice cafe/bar/restaurant. Both doors are nicely ramped and staff are very attentive in opening the doors for wheelchair users. No access problems in disabled toilet. Staff very helpful and friendly throughout.
2950,With paved walkways and elevator special access to a well-lit huge cave complex. Some steep slippery areas better to have two assistants for safety.
2951,Everyone was friendly and accommodating.
2952,The accessible toilets near the terrace are very accessible. There are four dedicated disabled loos (2 toilets per section) which are good.
2953,Limited parking on the Royal Mile.
2954,"There are three disabled bays available right outside hotel entrance, with a pathed ramp to get you up into hotel, through automatic doors, and all on the level. 
The large long hotel has ramps where needed, and a lift is available after a long walk along corridors, some with a slight slope to navigate. 
You are able to see what the hotel offers, but to get out onto the terrace, you need to be taken along sloping, twisting corridors, which can be a nuisance to turn about in, and go through the main restaurant to reach the door to getbyounoutbonto terrace, there is no other way to do so."
2955,Accessible station with helpful staff and lifts.
2956,"The shop is in a pedestrian area, but near a road.
There are some disabled parking spaces nearby, but often full.
Public transport stops are fairly near, but probably not close enough for anyone walking with difficulty."
2957,great access
2958,"When it came to ordering we were told to hold our wands up and shout the spell out and someone would come to take our order, there was no one around when we did this so one of us had to go and find someone, otherwise they were amazing :) "
2959,"Given the location is an activity centre, there is a great deal of parking and many blue badge spaces. One thing we have noticed about very modern places, however, is that there is a great deal of pedestrian/pavement space between the parking and the buildings - and even between the drop-off space and the building. I presume this is for safety, but it can be difficult for those who are trying to keep walking if possible (using an aid), rather than relying on a wheelchair all the time.

The drop-off zone (pictured) is still some distance from the door. It has a lowered kerb only at the right hand side of the picture, which is unfortunate as that is where delivery vans tend to pull up when taking items into Soar."
2960,"Although you have to go through a barrier, Parking is quite close to hotel entrance,  with four bays available, and just a short walk along path. Automatic sliding doors along a level entrance tales you into reception area.But do REMEMBER TO REGISTER YOUR CAR at reception to get a ticket to let you back out through the barrier."
2961,There are plenty of volunteers in pink t shirts to direct you.
2962,"On the edge of Dartmoor
Peaceful and beautiful "
2963,The staff member who showed us around the centre was out of this world. Abbey was very knowledgeable and took her time in explaining how we could best use the facilities and answered all of the questions we had around accessing the centre. It was very refreshing to know that we were getting the information we needed and being valued as a customer. Can't recommend this place enough!
2964,Very helpful indeed and suggested solutions when I mentioned to gap was too narrow for a wheelchair user to access the toilet.
2965,No one came to look after us. 
2966,There were multiple disabled car parking spaces located nearest to the several entrances. 
2967,There is a pay-and-display car park Just across the road where blue badge holders can park for free. There is also a disabled toilet in this car park.
2968,"Clean, well designed accessible toilets on both floors.  Changing Place facility available."
2969,"The parking at the Stade de France is good. It is complicated to drive to due to the road closures around the stadium but eventually you reach P4, which is the disabled parking area. To request parking there you need to ring up the ticketing service for the event you are about to watch a few weeks before traveling to the stadium - in our case it was UEFA. Once you have done this you are free to park in the available blue badge spots. If there is no space left when you arrive there is an overflow car park across the road, specifically for the disabled and the fire brigade!"
2970,Particularly helpful
2971,You really need a car to get here as it is on the outskirts of Glastonbury. That said only 3 small parking spaces.
2972,The accessible loo is to the left of the bar on the right. The loo is well equipped but it is a bit on the small side for those with larger wheel chairs. 
2973,"Two loos - one in en suite wet room (so handy for nighttime visits) and one in shared bathroom.  One room is very small, the other very large - neither have grab rails. However I managed using the wall and my walker to hold onto when getting up.  I would suggest portable aids to assist I use of the loos and showers (see below).
The wet room shower area has a pebbled floor - which wasn't slippery. As it was a small shower i could use walls to balance. There was a shortage of places to put shampoo etc so used walker.
Shower in shared bathroom ironically as a fixed seat but a 12 inch step up in"
2974,Staff were polite but not exceptionally friendly or enthusiastic. That was at the desk and in the cafe.
2975,I have used the airport many times and I've never had a situation where I couldn't get in my wheelchair.
2976,"Good standard, clean."
2977,There isn't any parking nearby and public transport is some distance away.
2978,"Bar/restaurant staff were very helpful - moved tables to accommodate us, very pleasant and friendly."
2979,Very nice and polite 
2980,"All on level ground. To go on most of the rides you need upper body control and the ability to get out of your wheelchair, however there is no charge for wheelchair users."
2981,"Staff were informative and very helpful throughout. My PA was unable to come with me on my most recent visit, so staff were happy to escort me to my wheelchair space and out at the interval and the end."
2982,"The entrance is step-free and easy, the serving area is spacious. So far, so good. But when a wheelchair user wants to settle to enjoy food and drink at a table, the choice of tables is very limited because the tables are crammed so close together, and with such big and heavy chairs, that it's difficult or even impossible to use most of them. There just isn't room to manoeuvre and park. "
2983,Plenty of flat areas and paths that are wheelchair friendly. 
2984,"The whole experience was enjoyable from beginning to end, the tour has been very well thought out and accessibility must have been a huge part of that because there lots of lifts and ramps in place, every part of the tour is accessible including the interactive elements which are easy to reach from wheelchair height. "
2985,"Helpful staff, easy to get around, level access, and accessible loo."
2986,It was fairly easy to find but far away from the main rooms
2987,"Other than the person at the desk, we had no interaction with staff members, although there were some going about.  Also talks were given at various times during the day."
2988,"80 seat theatre with café/ bar area.  They have a diverse programme covering drama, comedy, thrillers and occasionally musicals. Please be aware that this is an off West End or fringe theatre, this means its a lovely intimate space which hosts exciting productions with small casts and the set and costumes are creative and innovated but don't think it big, glossy theatre productions. This means that you can see diverse and original theatre from small and often new theatre companies. 

Most of its productions have a short run of 2 - 4 weeks and some are on for 1 or 2 nights only, so along with its small space this means productions often sell out quickly. "
2989,"Helpful, but they need more on the tills in the evenings."
2990,"Had everything been modern and fully accessible I'd be awarding 5stars, that's the only issue though, that the ferries were not designed fully accessible.  They are keenly aware of the needs of disabled passengers and have systems in place to deal with those with limited mobility or sight and hearing limitations.  Where things were not designed accessible, they've worked around it and all staff had a can do attitude and were friendly and professional."
2991,Carried drinks to a table. Attentive without being intrusive.
2992,"The accessible toilet I used was large, very well equipped, bright and light, and spotlessly clean."
2993,"The entrance from the street is through open double doors of a slight incline on the pavement. You will pass the door to the Accessible Toilet on the right before another set of double doors, which swing open forward into the restaurant and bar area.
The restaurant has an outside terrace which overlooks the River Tyne, but that is currently inaccessible in a wheelchair.

Many of the tables are pedestals, so it is easy to get underneath in a wheelchair as the height is about 75cm."
2994,"I strongly sensed and experienced this a well trained, motivated and knowledgeable workforce who have customer service and provision as their prime benchmark. From the opening of of the door to enter or leave, thoughtful and informative reception and event staff, some of whom were volunteers, uniformed staff throughout the Gallery made it a thoroughly positive, enjoyable and inclusive experience.

I have left the main course of the DAD event till the last as this was a completely holistic, sensory story experience incorporating themes of Spring, the Gallery, it’s outdoor areas and the performing arts in relation to the story. The thoughtful presentation by PAMIS enabled it to promote and  evoke experiences of  the turbulence  this season can bring in weather,  the message of growth, regeneration, and the onset of summer. Those of us who attended were met with a wonderful array of sensory experiences. The 30 mins could have easily been extended but it was experiential in every way."
2995,Large pet supermarket - faceless and lacking any character. Feels like a prison for any animals sold here.
2996,"I'm not sure able public transport however there's a very large car park right outside which wasn't even half full on a Saturday afternoon.

Whilst the museum is free, parking isn't and my partner found the machine to pay didn't work very well if you didn't have exact change. Staff at reception were able to help with this and there was an attendant in the far corner of the car park which we only spotted after we'd resolved it! Other than that, getting there was very easy."
2997,There is a paved path all the way round both the house and the lodge. Level access is into the kitchen as there were a couple of steps to the front. 
2998,Good overall 
2999,"Holybrook car park in The Oracle has Shopmobility and lots of blue badge parking spaces. Parking is expensive though. There is a lift down to street level, and then you need to go to the Chain Street entrance for wheelchair access to John Lewis. The Minster Street entrance has stairs only."
3000,"Excellent access. Nice and warm in the winter, cool in the summer. Great coffee and grub too!"
3001,"Smelled a bit. Poeple were also using them who didn't need to and the were a bit dirty, on the plus side the did have nice music."
3002,Disabled toilets available.
3003,You would need your own transport.  Large gravel carpark with disabled spaces at the entrance.  The gravel is quite compact so it's quite easy to push a wheelchair over
3004,Cannot fault Maria in the restaurant she reserves tables so there are always some avail for disabled people
3005,They have changing place toilets and normal accessible toilets the rest cord was hanging freely in the disabled toilet
3006,"There are toilets dotted around the park although they aren't obvious. The accessible toilet was large enough to fit a carer in and had grab rails to help with transfers. However, the toilets are quite wet and dirty. "
3007,Access at all the Breweries was good.
3008,Didn't use the loo but it's clearly signposted.  It's on the 2nd floor but accessible by lift. 
3009,"Very clean with decent hand dryer and hand wash, also has baby changing facilities"
3010,The buses to downtown Disney springs are fully accessible and everything is flat and accessible.  The car park is a long way from the rainforest cafe though so I wouldn't recommend driving
3011,Full disabled access to all parts. No steps at entrance and lifts inside house
3012,"Would love to review this loo in more detail, but it was closed on my visit, at 1030 am.

All I can say, is it is very easy to find. Located on the left in the main public car-park, just off Callander's main street."
3013,Staff are slow to respond and seemingly nonchalant when it comes to meeting our needs.
3014,Staff are great on the few occasions we have been there and actually managed to see a movie
3015,"This is an ornamental gardens with a small garden centre, shop, cafe etc attached.

They have one mobility scooter plus some manual wheelchairs. I booked the scooter the day before by phone and it was all very easy.

There's lots to see in the gardens, mostly it's quite ornamental with things like a rose garden and a lily pond. We also ran across some small wildlife areas with longer grass, beehives and a river on the edge of the site.

The shop and garden centre were fun. They sell apple juice from their orchards which was a highlight. There were also other attactions we did not visit like the museum.

A good day out! "
3016,"VIsited this cottage with my wife. I suffer from Motor Neurone Disease needing help for most activities but still being able to walk albeit slowly. We found the cottage ideal for our needs. The level flooring and the wide doors made moving around the property very easy and the easy access to the veranda was a bonus allowing us to sit outside, take in the wonderful views and keep an eye on the activities of the cow in the field!  The wet room had everything that we needed. The cottage was very clean, modern and light - a lovely cottage to spend time in.  Gordon and Ann Greeted us on our arrival and could not have been more helpful.  "
3017,"Excellent lifts in the shop, fast, spacious, plenty of them, and they don't smell of a sewer like the ones in the old shop. 

It's easy to navigate around the shop, though there are some fairly tight gaps which *can* be negotiated in even a wide wheelchair, if you take care. Half a star lost because they have put very wide, heavy benches between banks of bookshelves, and there isn't room for a wheelchair to pass without shoving a bench out of the way, which can be awkward and difficult. They also put big benches in front of the lift buttons; people then sit on these benches; this can make it VERY hard to access the lift buttons from a wheelchair. Thoughtless!!

The staff have a bad habit of parking their enormous heavy metal book-trolleys in places which obstruct access to the bookshelves for wheelchair users. They also put impromptu bookshelving units in places which make gaps too narrow to negotiate in a wheelchair - see my picture below. 

The staff also have a bad habit of dumping large packing crates and heavy metal book-trolleys right outside lift doors, which means that sometimes it's impossible to exit the lift in a wheelchair. This is very silly and thoughtless.

The 5th floor café is a horrible place for wheelchair users. The tables are crammed too close together so it's very hard to find anywhere with enough space and manoeuvre-room. The background music is loud jazz of the most boring, monotonous, meaningless type, and it makes conversation difficult . Best to avoid the café if you're a wheelchair user or if you have hearing difficulties.

""Store Guides"" are placed in some locations, but erratically, without rhyme or reason, not near every lift - this is a real irritation."
3018,"Access in general was fantastic.  Access to the venue was step-free, signage was brilliant and easy to use, seats were readily available to take a break when needed and ample lifts were available (although the doors did shut very quickly!) Another thing I loved was the consideration for access at the performance I went to see: a chair was already moved away so I could back my wheelchair in and be a true part of the performance, and the actors explained that the performance was a relaxed one offered portable hearing loops and took the audience through what to expect in terms of light and sound before they started - very impressive and much appreciated!"
3019,"A number of staff spoke to us as we went round the store all were friendly, Helpful if you were looking for something"
3020,The disabled toilet was small and I couldn’t turn my chair around in it .It is shared with baby changing table and there was a big bin in the corner making the space even more tighter and hard to manoeuvre within .Both me and my companion could not fit in the toilet together. There was no changing places toilet either. 
3021,staff were very helpful and pointed me in the direction of where i needed to be. It is a very busy centre with a range of business within but the staff were approachable 
3022,"The venue is a great centre to try out new experiences. Scared of heights I wasn't sure of some of the activities but with the encouragement and patience of the staff I tried the zip wire. Thanks to all the staff that made this weekend one that was full of fun, adventure and lots of memories. This weekend was spent with my friend, her daughter and my two girls. Although my child was non-verbal and has ASN, the staff spent time getting to know her and understanding what her needs were and through this she felt excitement, encouraged and included.  "
3023,"Level access from street to wheelchair accessible spots in the circle. As far as I'm aware there is no wheelchair access to any other part of the theatre. From the circle (first floor) you have a good view, but immediately in front of you is a walkway which has creaky floorboards (which does your head in if lots of people are popping in and out to the bar or toilet during the show!)"
3024,"Only accessed in room, described as above "
3025,"I accessed from the rear, via The John Muir Walk, where there is a lift to all floors, and went to the first floor Café for coffee and home made cake (well you have to) which was delicious!! and overlooks the peaceful wild garden. Such a lovely setting and the volunteering staff members made me feel very welcome."
3026,"Ask for Room 4 which has its own secure access.  There is one shallow step but I presume the hotel will provide a ramp (request this when booking).
Meals are taken at the gastropub next door (there is a ramp and a ground floor accessible toilet). Unfortunately there is not a covered walkway for any guest!  But there is tea/coffe making facilities in the room"
3027,Disabled parking is limited in Bath City centre and central car parks are expensive.  This is the cheapest and easiest way to visit even with a wheelchair.   Kneeling buses with a drop down ramp at car park venue and raised kerbs at City centre stops for level access.  Buses approx every 10-15 mins.  3 Park & ride locations.
3028,Right outside the door
3029,Very accommodating and happy to help.
3030,"Tramper available to do a 3 to 4 mile trail through fields and forest around the estate, as well as the formal gardens. Very enjoyable trail with great views over the countryside. Some gates so take someone to accompany you to open and close them. "
3031,"Easy access to cinema, lift up to the screens, screens 7-12  entrances halfway up the seat rows so steps can be avoided without having to get a crick in your neck by sitting at the bottom. Plenty of room to park the mobility scooter/wheelchair in front of your seat if you're in the 'entry' row. Minus half a mark for the 'push' door into the screen."
3032,"Step-free throughout, with plenty of wheelchair-friendly tables. "
3033,"They come to you - wherever suits you best, we arranged to meet at the hotel lobby where we were staying."
3034,Not the usual image of a museum. From arriving at the front door access was easy and also presented some welcome surprises!
3035,The outlet shopping centre has good level entry and excellent flooring throughout. Some ramps which are quite steep.
3036,There is a ramp to the hall of remembrance but most of the site is rough grass and impossible to access with a wheelchair. The ground is also liberally covered in poo from the Canada Geese!
3037,"Altho' the hotel has a car park this is primarily for residents, restaurant guests are permitted to use it if there is space. (We visited twice & were able to use the carpark on both occassions.) There is limited road parking nearby, however the road immediately outside the hotel & adjoining side street has double yellow lines.  There is a carpark not too far away with daytime access to the hotel by a small shopping arcade - but access via the arcade is closed in the evenings. 
Unfortunately a good restaurant spoiled by parking."
3038,"Access into the building is via a wide door although it is on a rather odd angle which may be difficult. Once inside there's good circulation space to get around. If you're visiting the cafe the tables and chairs can be moved if required to make space. The gallery spaces are large, bright, light and spacious. The lower score reflects the state of the lift which takes you to the upper gallery. It's rather tight to get into and contains an audio art installation which can be quite unnerving. Not a great idea for people with sensory impairments. The lift itself failed repeatedly - not good!"
3039,"The OCS PRM team you could not ask for friendlier people and their knowledge of the Eagle Lifter is second to ""NONE"". 

Security were first class and very helpful with information which is in my Overview.

If you want to read my Easyjet review put ""Easyjet and Luton UK"" in the search box. Worth a read as we know how disabled friendly they are."
3040,"I used Béatrice Taxis from La Rochelle and on the way there I was in a people carrier, on the return trip I used the same taxi company and they had got me a people carrier with a pull out step, which made it easier to get in and out. The driver was extremely helpful and took my luggage into the hotel. Alternatively there is buses which run throughout the day connecting Ile de Re to La Rochelle. The nearest bus stop is Saint Martin de Re Le Port and it is a 1 minute level walk to the Port. In the Spring - Autumn if you are driving to access the port area requires a code, which your hotel should give you and there is a charge for the car parks. There are direct flights in the summer season from Gatwick to La Rochelle with an actual flying time of 1 hour 10 minutes."
3041,"The Hotel Medemblik has a wheelchair accessible conference center, bar and restaurant.  There is also an accessible toilet on the conference floor.  The main entrance is not accessible for those with disabilities, but the hotel can also be accessed through the restaurant on the back.  The rooms are somewhat accessible for those in wheelchairs."
3042,"Clyde Shopmobility organised a tour inside the Sea Life Centre in Loch Lomond Shores, Balloch. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The tour was amazing. The centre was accessible and the toilets were too. We went to the Coffee restaurant at the top of the Sea Life Centre and the manager offers us our lunch break. They were very gentle. It was an adventure. I have never been there and everything was lovely.  "
3043,"The reception was clearly signposted with big yellow signs. My companion and I had no trouble finding the entrance.

The apartments are in different blocks and we were taken to the apartment which was helpful. It’s more a less a case of going in the front door, getting the lift, and then a short step or two to the apartment front door.

Once inside the apartment was clean, modern, well furnished and easy to move around in."
3044,"Extremely helpful, very friendly and caring"
3045,"Access into the Elephant Coffee entails a small ramp incline. Within the café is a range of seating; a short bar with high stools, fixed benches around the edge and moveable seating which staff are on hand to move if required. Between the tables is a narrow space, restricting the space for wheelchairs. There is also limited seating outside with two tables and four chairs, which are located on the pavement at the front. Orders are taken at the till which is positioned at standing height, although next to the till there is a gap that staff use to go in and out which staff may use if required."
3046,"Pleasant shopping experience , accessible independent High Street Retailer. Fabulous choice of quality produce, they boast 50 cheeses in stock, as well as selection of Scottish gins,  luxury coffees , teas etc, and my beloved Stornoway Blackpudding. Slight drawback in that it was a bit tight to manoeuvre the wheelchair in places, but owner was super helpful, and moved anything that was in my way."
3047,There are various toilets dotted around The Vatican  - just ask.
3048,"In the cathedral and the grounds there was great access, plenty of ramps to get to the different parts. Only difficult bit was the paths walking to the cathedral from the town get too narrow for a wheelchair but there also isn't any drop curbs."
3049,Ian as a host is excellent - attentive without being obtrusive.
3050,"Lots of space and room round tables, bar quite high"
3051,Parking is quite difficult in Chorlton as it is a small but busy village. There is parking available in the nearby streets. All pavements have ramped access in the area
3052,"Automated doors and wide enough for wheelchair access.
Lift available to access upper floors."
3053,"The entrance to the shop is step-free. It's easy to get around the ground floor. But on the day of my visit, the lift was out of order, and according to the member of staff I spoke to, has been out of order for a long while after more than one breakdown, and will be out of order for a long while yet, as there are problems with ordering spare parts. So I was only able to access half of the shop - and unluckily it was the half of the shop I didn't need."
3054,The main access is at street level with a slope down to the heart of the building. ( cinema numbers 2 and 3 are slightly separate and at street level). Within the building there are lifts to bring you to the various venues/restaurants etc
3055,"This is the UK's foremost ethical chocolatier. They have been in Glasgow and Edinburgh for a few years selling chocolate but have now opened a much welcomed coffee shop in Buchanan Street, Glasgow. Good access to Hot chocolate like you have never tasted before. "
3056,"Travelling around the Highlands in winter, I was amazed to find that this tea room was open! Everywhere else seemed to be shut for the season. The cafe is tiny, but it has put thought into accessibility with a ramp, accessible parking spaces and an accessible toilet."
3057,The staff are not very friendly and not very helpful. 
3058,"On advice from my son we hired a mobility scooter and took that to Stourhead. Unless you have a team of fit wheelchair pushers you’ll struggle with the steep paths - especially as the entrance/exit is at the top of a steep slope after you’ve used your energy going round the beautiful lake and exploring its buildings.
We didn’t try to go to the house, but were disappointed that there are steps that precluded us getting access to the walled garden."
3059,Parking in The Kingsgate multi story. Prices have been slashed so don't be afraid to use it. Shopmobility on lower ground. Phone ahead and they will meet you with a scooter 01383 661455
3060,"Staff are generally helpful, and will help carry food to the table if requested. One star was lost because we encountered an able-bodied member of staff using the only accessible toilet!"
3061,After driving through the tunnel you emerge on the Hoe. Separated from other land areas it offers views of the sea and white cliffs plus a landscape to view nature. Paths are up and down on a firm but cambered surface. We did a 2 K circular route. There is a good toilet and cafe with picnic benches. People can fish from the sea wall.  Solid surface car park. 
3062,"I can't describe it as our powerchair user didnt use it, but therewas one in the visitor centre I think and another in the cafe. Sporry can'r comment further - mnaybe someone else can add a comment about this?"
3063,"I used one toilet that was accessible. It was huge with plenty of space, but at 8 p.m. it wasn’t the cleanliness. "
3064,"Needed a temporary ramp for one step at the entrance. Staff were happy to put this in place when we arrived and left and offered assistance. 
Plenty of room to move the wheelchair around the restaurant. 
Staff happy to move a chair from the table."
3065,Automatic entrance door.  Flat everywhere.  Lift.  Seating in every gallery.  Spacious everywhere.  Signage clear.
3066,We drove and there were many blue badge bays on a hard flat surface near the entrance. 
3067,we had our own car and were able to park feet from the entry to our cottage.
3068,"Other than the courtyard, access around Linlithgow Palace by its very nature is not easy. There are handles up all of the stone spiral staircases, but these are big, steep steps of varying heights and condition. Some of the cellars are pitch black with dim lighting for safety, but it won't be suitable for everybody. 

Inside the rooms and the corridors however the smooth stone paving is very welcome! I didn't feel like I was going to trip in the dark at any point which was reassuring.

The courtyard is worth a visit however! The ornate fountain in the middle is amazing, and they used to fill it with wine during royal parties. There are lots of information boards around the courtyard and helpful staff to answer any questions about the site."
3069,The access is generally very good. You will need to go to the Special Assistance Reception after you check in.
3070,Ramps at the back to get to the cottage and everything on one level.
3071,"My partner/carer and I went to go see Alun Cochrane as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. His show was amazing. The venue was nice and clean but not exactly accessible. There were about 12 steps down into the venue itself which were fairly evenly spaced out and no visible access without stairs. As it's a small venue there were tables and chairs so closely packed together that even if you could get in without stairs, you wouldn't have been able to manoeuvre yourself in a wheelchair or with a walking aid. Props to the staff they were great and got me a highbacked chair when I explained I couldn't sit in a backless chair because of my condition but as the venue was small and completely packed, we were very close to the stage so it hurt my back anyway. The staff were lovely, the bar was affordable but again the bar wasn't at an accessible height and there isn't enough space for access to the bar with mobility aids.  Thankfully I was having a good leg day otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get into the venue. "
3072,"Cake stories is a lovely independent cafe and cake shop. Unlikely to branch in Jesmond this shop has step free access and disabled toilet. 
Parking in Hoults Yard is available directly outside the shop and is free for the first hour. Patrons can sit inside or outside. Outside there are a variety of tables available including some quirky seats in converted storage containers which have a disabled friendly ramp to access (although chairs and tables are low here so may not be suitable for all and slight lip to access). There are also tables and benches outside which can accommodate a wheelchair user. Inside there are 2 tables suitable for disabled customers on the first level by the door (which can be reserved if you are planning your visit). 2 steps take you down to further seating- which may be accessible without steps if staff are able to open a set of french doors.
There is a disabled toilet available down a small corridor, however there is a small table currently in the way that narrows the corridor that needs to be moved. Toilet has appropriately placed grab rails- see photos. Staff are friendly and helpful- all wearing face-masks. 
Overall a lovely establishment- would be 5/5 if the table obstructing the toilet access was moved. "
3073,All the ones we met were helpful and aware of disability issues.
3074,"Wow, simply wow!

The most fabulous Changing Places Toilet I've seen in a while ... the ""Experience"" also has disabled toilets located on each floor too."
3075,"Entrance is via automatic doors.  There 2 lifts one going down to the lower floor;the other to the upper floors.  
There is always assistance with other doors or the lifts if it is needed.

There are plenty of places where guests can rest if the need to. "
3076,"Staff were friendly, helpful & attentive. "
3077,Not very big. Bins take up transfer space. Had to put card on red cord. 
3078,"The Postal Museum tells the story of the British postal service and has a phenomenal and impressive display of artefacts, many very iconic. It tells the history of the postal service and telephone services. The museum is located on two sites, which are almost just across the road from each other. Both buildings are step free. The larger building houses the main museum collection and its archives centre. The smaller building is home to Mail Rail and a smaller exhibition gallery. Mail Rail, which used to transport post has been adapted to accommodate passengers, however people have to meet their evacuation requirements to be able to ride the train."
3079,"Ramp access , good  signage
Doors were heavy to open, but staff assisted with this
"
3080,Getting to the Pantheon may be a bit tricky for some as the streets around it are cobbled. However once you are there you'll find that it is fully accessible.
3081,Staff were helpful when we asked for information.
3082,"Level access at the entrance and automatic door with a button press. disabled rooms on the ground floor close to the reception, and the Winter Garden Cafe and shop. Lift access to all levels and restaurants and the cinema, Victorian Spa (adults only), Swimming pools, Beauty salon etc.  You can access everything easily in the hotel. "
3083,"The Skippers and crew are all very friendly and supportive, have a sound knowledge  of the History of STC and the canals and are very hospitable"
3084,"As the title says, the food is brilliant - there is Indian food, Chinese food, Japanese food, American food and many, many other foods from different countries, however, in my opinion, the wheelchair access and disabled access, in general, is terrible. The access to the restaurant is step free and smooth floors all the way to the restaurant entrance. I had to wait in a queue to be seated and when we got to the front of the queue a member of staff said to my stepdad ""can he get out of his chair?"".  Now, it annoys me when people talk to the ""carer"" and not the person just because they use a wheelchair or a scooter, but besides that what would have happened if I said ""no""? Luckily for me, I could get out my mobility scooter so my stepdad said ""yes he can, why?"" and the member of staff said ""Oh its just because he might have some trouble moving around the restaurant in his chair"" so I parked my scooter near the toilets  and my stepdad helped me to walk around the restraunt."
3085,"I want to praise this hotel particularly because it had a family room with an accessible bathroom - something which can be a real pain to find, as it's usually assumed that disabled people won't have children... It had step free access to the communal areas and our  bedroom, and was clean, comfortable, central and good value for money."
3086,All tables are on the ground floor and there are no steps. The only problem area is the salad bar where there is little room to manoeuvre and is probably too high to be accessed from a chair. 
3087,they couldn't do enough to help
3088,"Drive from Torquay
About 30 minutes via A38
Bus to Buckfastleigh
Plenty of parking
"
3089,The en-suite was also spacious and fairly clean ( nooks and crannies which would be difficult to get really clean).  There was an accessible shower and clean towels and soap were provided. There were also grab rails and an emergency cord both in the en-suite and in the cabin.
3090,"Few Blue Badge parking spots, with ramped kerb (but it was on a bit of a slope so I needed my carers help to push me).
Staff where very friendly and helpful.
Few free from options in the café and the food tasted lovely - I would return.
Plenty of seating options in the café and we could find a space for my wheelchair to sit at a table.
As well as the café and garden centre there's also a place that sells gifts and bits and bobs, but the aisles and displays left little room for me to get my wheelchair round and me and my carer really struggled to navigate around and there where some places even my narrow wheelchair couldn't get through. (I have contacted the to make them aware of this.)
Accessible loo and the red cord was hanging freely (yay!) and left a Red Cord Card."
3091,"The disabled parking is just outside the visitor's centre, but you can drive right down to the start of boardwalk if you have difficulty walking.  I didn't bother as the gravel is hardcore and not loose so not a problem for my electric wheelchair."
3092,Top marks! Very friendly and helpful. Happy to offer assistance when needed.
3093,"Very helpful, met us as soon as we arrived and showed us around the venue before the show to make sure we were happy with our seating arrangements (we had requested extra seating for a large group)."
3094,Staff were v helpful. There were staff walking around all the time keeping the place clean and offered assistance if required
3095,No special toilets.
3096,"All areas have wherlchair access including the spa. The pool has fantastic facilities. There is a large disabled persons changing room with ceiling hoist and changing table (also toilet and shower) 
There are two available pool chairs which you can self propel. There is ramp access to showers, large private shower cubicles are also wheelchair accessible. All buttons are at a good height for most.
The pool has a 'beach style' sloped entry. The smaller teaching pool has a hoist available.
"
3097,Decent sized accessible loo located next to the bar. Didn't need to use it on this visit.
3098,Designated parking outside each of the properties . We stayed at Hidelow house which sleeps 4 .
3099,no steps lots of parking even a nive lake with path all the way around
3100,2 Disabled spaces directly outside.
3101,There's an adjacent parking area for the pub. No disabled spaces I could see.  Is alongside the pub so a bit of a trek to the front door. Don't know about buses. No parking right outside front door.
3102,"I think this has potential to be very good, but not the way we did it. We took one of Barcelona's fine wheelchair-accessible buses to what looked like a stop close to the museum. It turned out, though, that there was a steep climb up through some residential streets to actually reach the place, which would not have been possible without the powerful 10kph scooter I had rented - certainly too steep for manual wheelchairs. 

However, we discovered later that we had approached the museum through the back entrance, and at the front, there is a level road outside where a taxi could drop you off - and there's probably a bus route that goes up there too. It's worth investigating this before you go."
3103,"The Palace Theatre has one of the most excellent disabled toilets in the whole of Newark in my opinion, there is so much space to move around and they have got a superb sink, which enables me to rinse out my urine bottle after use, please be aware urine is not poured down the sink, the sink is just used to wash it out to try and get rid of any nasty smells!"
3104,It's not very easy to get there on public transport from where I live (even though it's not far!) so I took a taxi which was able to stop very close to the entrance.
3105,"Totally accessible, great food but difficult to find the accessible toilets."
3106,"As long as you've got robust wheels it's highly accessible.  Some sections have a few ups and downs at the access points, which you may need assistance with (the section running north from Mickleton has a gentle slope - see photos- which I was fine with).  The trickiest bit me was a few gates where the trail crosses farm tracks and I needed help with those.  They're plenty wide enough though. Surface is firm, notwithstanding a few bumpy sections and the occasional bunny scrape!"
3107,"It is evident that the Book Festival team have considered accessibility and making people feel included. I loved the discovery of the different performances available where there was BSL interpretation, captioned, relaxed and easy access and so much more. Things for children, families and older folk. The richness of what was on offer made deciding what to see hard; but that's a good thing!"
3108,Buses stop right in-front of the Fountainpark centre and there is underground parking. There is also a drop off area on the level. 
3109,Car parking next to the lodge
3110,"Staff are helpful and all appear to have some training.
They check whether you can access equipment and where is the best position for chairs. etc.
I usually transfer to a seat, but they ask me first."
3111,"Good level access, with no steps."
3112,"most of the restaurant is accessible, but the single wheelchair parking bay is the furthest from the door on the edge of the road access to the drive through.

a lot worse than this is the joke of a toilet. to access the toilets you have to pull open a heavy fire door into a vestibule little bigger than a wheelchair, inside here are 5 further doors, open any one of these and you cannot open any others apart from the entrance. to open the ""Accessible"" toilet you need a radar key, but the lock is set so you cannot get the key out of the lock while the door is open, so you have the choice of using the toilet while leaving your keys in the outside of the door where anyone can take them or let themselves into the room with you or begging a member of staff to come and let you in, while you go back to the restaurant and wait, then the vestibule is so small you have to juggle everyone's positions to get into the toilet.

when in the room itself it is tiny, not enough room to turn a wheelchair or have someone to help you unless you leave the toilet door wide open, with no privacy, this lack of room is not improved by the inclusion of obtrusive baby changing facilities, my impression of the toilet was that it was a baby changing room that someone said ""Oh, we can push a small wheelchair in here, why not make it an accessible toilet too?""

all in all i would have been more comfortable sitting in a puddle of urine than going through all that!"
3113,"Getting to the cathedral for a wheelchair user could be tricky, there are narrow paths and a cobbled street. There is a longer route to the cathedral which is slightly easier and is via the cloisters. There is disabled parking available on Palace Green and there is also a shuttle bus that has wheelchair access (although this was tested on the day)."
3114,"Douglas and Jonathon were amazing.  So nice and chatty, very attentive. Loved to tell stories about how the beers were invented etc.

"
3115,All the staff I met were helpful and friendly. I would encourage people to contact the hotel prior to booking as they were very willing to help where they could. They can also tell you more about what’s available.
3116,"Good level access. Unfortunately there is little space between tables, so unsuitable for wheelchair users & can also be difficult for anyone with walking difficulties. "
3117,Hotel car park which was multi storey. We were unablele to book a disabled parking space.
3118,"The salon is all on one level, including the sinks, and there is room to manoeuvre a small mobility scooter. Staff are great and happy to move chairs to make getting around easier.
Only downside is a manual door at the entrance but staff are quick to come and open it with a smile. "
3119,Very aware and clear speaking was Rupert's description of what went on in every part of the museum and some very good demonstrations of parts of the jewellery making process. Kept us all interested for a hour and bit about what went on and the history of Jewellery making from the beginning of the factory to present. 
3120,"Lots of buses stop at the bus stop outside the Usher Hall, about 150m away.  There is a disabled parking bay on Cambridge street (Traverse side of the Usher Hall). Tricky to park on Lothian Road if you needed to be nearer to the venue than that."
3121,"Level access from the car to the venue and all lanes, pool tables and the bar are entirely accessible. The whole building is very spacious which allowed a group with 9 people (inc 6 wheelchairs) to be accommodated."
3122,We only interacted with staff when we ordered but they were nice. There are not many staff walking around the floor.
3123,"The staff are outstanding in ensuring our children have a range of adventurous and physical activities. They are highly skilled in using equipment, adapted activities and appropriate levels of language to ensure that children are challenged to take part in a full range of activities. We won’t go anywhere else!"
3124,The venue we could not use because having a wheelchair it was to busy for us and we were asked to come back as there were no seats and no room for wheelchair 
3125,"They seemed fine, in good order and clean"
3126,Really helpful
3127,"Not far from the Royal Mile, the Music Museum is a great find!
 
St Celias Hall is part of Edinburgh University (though is a building in its own right, you don't go to the university campus). The collection has several galleries showing some of its historic musical instruments from 16th to 20th century.

It's worth downloading the free app before you go. "
3128,"Superb staff, more than once  greeted with a cheery smile and 'hello'"
3129,Staff are friendly and helpful. There is a staffed customer service desk just inside the entrance.
3130,"Easy to find free blue badge parking with very helpful parking attendant. Lovely grounds but mostly gravel so very difficult to traverse unless you are in a power wheelchair, Did not go into the palace on this visit but enjoyed gardens, river views and restaurant for lunch."
3131,On street parking nearby but can be busy with shoppers as it is in the town centre. Local bus stop within 5 minutes walking distance or 2 minutes in a powerchair.
3132,"This building used to be a library, and is still owned by the council, so everything is there for there to be perfect accessibility. As it goes, there's serious room for improvement. The garden ramp has fallen into disrepair, the corridors are so packed full of boxes and shelves that it would be impossible to get around with a wheelchair or walker. Layout of sofas and desks leaves little room for the mobility impaired to actually get around."
3133,The nearest step free tube stations are King's Cross and Farringdon. From both these station you can take a number 63 bus to a stop which is a couple of minutes level walk to the museum. Also there are other buses which stop close by.
3134,"Now this is good, over a dozen disabled parking bays right up by the entrance, all on the flat, and if needed a small lift available. There is not much for the casual visitor to see, but at least there was plenty of room to move around."
3135,"There is a very big step up into the shop. Staff will provide a wheelchair ramp for you to enter the shop, but once inside you will find that only the ground floor is accessible, there is no lift to the upstairs areas. It is very hard to let staff know that you want to come into the shop - a doorbell is needed."
3136,"There was an accessible toilet in a corridor outside of the pub passed the gallery area. I'm unsure if there were any toilets immediately within the pub area. The accessible toilet was also used as a baby changing place. While waiting to use the toilet I had to stand in an narrow corridor. The accessible toilet was spacious, with grab rails and emergency cord."
3137,Staying at the Premier in Stratford was surprisingly straightforward. It's unusual in that reception is on the first floor and it's attached to a shopping centre. It's very modern and the accessible room I had was great with a picture window looking across to the Olympic Park.
3138,fine for me..but not changing places
3139,"Step free access to get in, it was easy to get around inside- plenty of space. It was quite well signposted and we enjoyed having a nosey about. I could reach most of the shelves which was nice! In the cafe the tables are quite low and in my power chair I cant get underneath, I imagine manual chairs with armrests also wouldn't get under although your legs might! The chairs are hard wood so I didn't transfer into one. It is table service and the staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed out coffees and cakes, at 4 o clock the staff were cleaning and putting chairs on tables and at 4:30 they started sweeping and mopping which kind of ruined the vibe so we left early, the cafe shuts at 5. "
3140,"The hotel has two entrances. 

Shedden Hill Road entrance is the one you will use if you are coming by car, is step free. This is a road leading away from the sea front and the start it slopes upwards ( if you are walking that way, there is a handrail on the roadside side of the pavement to the hotel). Once you enter the car park area there is a slope down to the entrance. The entrance had both steps and a ramp. There are automatic doors and this leads directly into reception with where there is also the Beefeater restaurant, bar and accessible toilet.

Belgrave Road entrance is a side entrance with 7 external steps with two hand rails, please note the handrails are wide apart so you would be unable to use both of them at once. For the top 2 steps there are no hand rails. There is then an automatic door and this leads into the reception area. From this entrance, you can access by key card the entrance to the hotel rooms, without having to go through the main reception area. If you are ok with stairs, then this is a good, quieter option if you want to try to avoid people.

When you first arrive the layout of the hotel bedrooms could be a little confusing depending where your room is. This is because the hotel is built on the side of a hill and has two blocks connected by a corridor which also has rooms leading off from it. My room was 411 (I think), which was in the Premier Plus section. In my instance, from the reception I entered via a key card into a corridor. I then took a right, almost immediately, along another longer corridor. There was a short, downward slope which had handrails on both walls and then a longish level walk to the end of the corridor was a manual door. From there I took a lift 1 floor to my corridor. The lift was quiet spacious had braille buttons and audio announcements. On exiting the lift on my left there was an manual exit door, which up a short flight of stairs you could exit into the car park (sorry I only used this once and forgot to photograph it) and on my right there was a manual door through to the corridor where my room was. The first time I was shown to my room by staff. I soon familiarised myself with the route . Sometimes when my spoons (energy) was low or I was in pain it felt quite a long distance, but given all the other benefits, it was not a deal breaker, so don't let it put you off,  but just be aware. 

The accessible room had wheels in shower and was huge. The bedroom was very spacious and from the window I had a partial view of the sea front. Personally the bed was a touch too soft for my preference. It was comfortable for sleeping in but I also sit on the bed to get dressed and put my shoes on, etc, and I could have done with something a bit firmer to assist with this. There was two small bedside tables, a desk and chair, flat screen TV, coffee maker, stool and hairdryer and what I found to be a very helpful wardrobe space. There is also an emergency cord by the bed. The bathroom had roll in shower with chair and grab rails designed for someone sitting in the chair. For someone like me who sometimes stands there were no specific grab rails. Instead I used the ones for people sitting and I put them in their upright position and found if I held the outer out and leaded towards the wall they were secure enough to use in the standing position. Ideally I would have appreciated standing height grab rails as well. Initially I didn't realise where the emergency cord was, as it was wrapped up in the shower curtain and reached to the floor. I would suggest familiarising yourself  with the emergency cord location prior to showering, just in case. There were grab rails at the toilet and vertical grab rails by the sink. The bathroom was very spacious. I was very happy and comfortable in my room.

The hotel as a Beefeater restaurant and separate bar area. The Beefeater restaurant is where meals are served at particular times. The breakfast is self service buffet. There are free standing tables and chairs as well as some fixed padded, sofa style seating. As well as breakfast I ate dinner in the restaurant twice. The food was always good. However, in the evening some food items were unavailable, this is due to the current national difficulties and not down to the hotel. The bar has free standing tables and chairs and some high bench stools and matching height tables. There is also a beer garden overlooking the sea-front, I didn't use this so unable to comment on accessibility."
3141,"The person directing cars into the car park was a bit clueless when we asked about accessible parking, but once he saw me struggling across the gravel he came over and said we could move the car onto the Tarmac, so perhaps we weren't explicit enough to start with...."
3142,Dedicated lift to take you to the first floor
3143,"Yes. large, clean and beautifully decorated like the rest of the place."
3144,vip disabled toilets have a hoist but thing these should be in normal toilets to!
3145,"Always very friendly and helpful, they will bring drinks over and allow you tasters.
"
3146,"A good accessible toilet, well-appointed and with an emergency cord hanging free as it should. Top marks."
3147,"Excellent accessible toilet with plenty of grab handles,only downside was i couldn't turn around in my powerchair so had to reverse out but my chair is quiet big."
3148,"The parking spaces are small and awkward to get into. They have 3 at entrance. The bays only have 1 side marked. My issue was the only bay had left side marked and bollards. I use a hoist so I need the right side marked as I can only forward in.

For some reason in some parts they have two disabled bays and one regular bay. They'd have been better off making two large disabled bays."
3149,Friendly and helpful staff
3150,Arrangements can be made for parking for disabled supporters and more information is available from the Hibernian Disabled Supporters' Association - www.hdsa.org.uk
3151,"There was level access from the street and a drop off area for taxi's etc to use. The front door is a revolving door which I wasn't sure I'd get through, but there was another standard door at the side. It wasn't clear that this was an accessible entrance, but there is a buzzer to press to speak to reception, so you get in eventually. Once inside, the restaurant is on the upper ground floor, but there is a platform lift to get you there and the staff couldn't be more helpful."
3152,Very helpful and understanding
3153,Disabled loo direct off the restaurant. Grab rails & emergency pull cord.
3154,Adequate disabled toilets.
3155,CG2014 venues have no on-site parking however for general use in the future thought car parking signage was insufficient.
3156,"Lovely 
Friendly
Helpful"
3157,"There are accessible, public toilets both at Dawlish and Coryton Cove. I used the ones at Dawlish and they were very clean, spacious, with grab rails. I didn't use the toilets at Coryton Cove."
3158,"We wheeled and walked. There is 24 hour parking in South Victoria Dock car park, just across the footbridge from the café. "
3159,"Through a door which has to be opened manually. It was too far away for me to reach so had to be opened by my carer. Inside, is accessible except if you want access to the books."
3160,"A relative had been years ago, it had only reopened recently after Covid and not all areas were open, but we had a very good guide who took us round and gave us lots of background detail. "
3161,"Really friendly staff. The lady at Concorde just blethered away as if she knew you. 
Even the staff in the wee shop, they were exactly the same, if you needed any help they were there right away. "
3162,A car park with two disabled places. 
3163,"A very blustery day for this visit but we got out of the vehicle anyway!
A very well presented carpark with lots of bays and clearly marked disabled ones nearest to the museum building. Level and flat so my mobility scooter had very little problems. 
Automatic doors prevented the usual tussle, therfore a smooth entry. 
The staff were informative and friendly, they had no issues with the mobility scooter except to advise that access to the preserved cottage would be limited to outside only.I was fine with that.
The remains of the museum was very easy to get around in my mobility scooter, wide aisles, spaces to manoeuvre etc. Ambient lighting was very soothing. The items and exhibits were at appropriate hieght for me to read info labels .
Outside was the massive field that the battle of Colloden took place on. Small gravel paths made moving about ok  However I didn't see the plaque comemorating  the battle as it was in the middle of the field, a long way off and the weather was blowing up a hoolie!
All in all a very nice, informative and relaxing afternoon. Well done Scottish National Trust "
3164,"For an old and historic building, access was really good.
The front doors have a push-button and then open themselves. The entrance is flat.

When inside, there are ramps wherever there are a few steps, and there is a lift to go to the different floors.

Corridors are all wide, and I think access would be fine to most areas. "
3165,Door to door taxi company with wheelchair accessible vans.
3166,Disabled friendly rooms have plenty of space in the room. The toilet and shower is fully accessible and a wet room. There is a wall seat in the shower. I use a manual wheelchair however the room is large enough to accommodate a power chair.
3167,"West Bank park is a 20-acre park located in Holgate, just outside the city centre. There is a large woodland area where there are  paths to follow through the trees. Next to this is a meadow area with picnic benches. The park has 2 very well maintained bowling greens which are often in use by West Bank Park Bowling Association, there are benches along the periphery to sit and watch. For children and teenagers there are two playgrounds - one for under eleven years, the other for over eleven's. The park also has a basketball court which is accessible when the park is open. There is a pergola walk, with roses and flowers to either side, but this does contain steps. The alternative path is wide and even, it is set on a slope and there are a few benches along the way to stop and rest if needed..
There are toilets in the park and a small car park nearby. The park is set along a main road between York city centre and Acomb, and this has numerous bus services running along it.

"
3168,"Most of the craft shops can be entered by a wheelchair, but tight, we walked in on my stick."
3169,"Signage for disabled parking clear, restaurant on level with car park, plenty of outdoor seating with space for wheelchairs to enable sitting out in summer weather.  Small area of restaurant is up three stairs but any time we have been there with our daughter a table has been made available on the ground floor.  a space had been made at the table for my daughter and set with children's menu prior to arrival so we could go straight in and be seated with no fuss.  Also plenty of space to manoeuvre my daughter's wheelchair indoors."
3170,The accessible toilets were functional but not great. The lock was faulty on the one I used in the main building and there weren't obvious signs to tell me about the accessible cubicles in the other toilets.
3171,There's two. The ground floor toilet seems wide enough but the door is quite heavy. I think the red cord is in the wrong place. The soap dispenser is at a good height and easy (for me) to push and the hand dryer is also at a good height. 
3172,Friendly and helpful staff. Note they don't take cards! This wasn't hugely obvious when we arrived.
3173,The Jubilee Line offers accessible connections to several places and is one of the more accessible tube lines.
3174,Excellent staff. Very knowledgeable
3175,"Stable block adapted to a high standard with lovely modern peaceful colour schemes. Spacious wet room. Enough room in lounge for disabled son to have a crawl around and explore. very clean. Well equipped kitchen. Nice showers. Gorgeous views over countryside. Helpful owners. Our youngest 2 enjoyed the tennis court and play room, despite the weather being very cold and windy. Our eldest with mobility needs is a tall teenager and the adult shower chair worked well for him. Grab handles in bathroom were useful. And laundry room a great help. This place was just perfect for us."
3176,"The staff were friendly and helpful, and the one person I asked about a ramp for the three steps at the front door was apologetic about not having one - but an apology is not an accessible restaurant. I was lucky enough to have two glamorous assistants to help me up these steps, and I can walk a bit, so we were fine, but not everyone is in this position."
3177,"Fabulous find, was given a gift voucher for afternoon tea, so glad I used it.
Plenty parking, accessible loo, all on the level, roomy,and amazing staff and food, what wasn’t to like? Almost perfect , but accessible loo could do with a couple minor improvements.
The lady serving us ( think she was the owner) made our visit very special, apart from being very attentive ( and serving our amazing afternoon tea) she went out of her way to make my visit a comfortable one, sitting us at a table with plenty of room for the chair, assisting with doors, checking I’d got out of the loo ok, and accompanying us in and out of the premises.
Definitely looking forward to my next visit, have been raving about it to everyone who’ll listen!
"
3178,The theatre is very old but they have certainly made a good effort to make disabled patrons welcome. There are steps and plenty of them! But the plus side was that wheelchairs users are catered for by providing a selection of spaces and my space had an excellent view. Signage is good and there are lifts to all areas.
3179,"Our members used it without any problem, it was clean."
3180,Clean and easy to use. You will occasionally find members of staff use this toilet (remember not all disabilities are visible).
3181,Hotel had its own free car parking for guests.
3182,"The corridors and doorways of the hotel are wide with plenty of space to turn. Push pads open all the main doors. The accessible bedrooms had wardrobe hanging spaces at different heights and fully accessible, wet room bathrooms. Red cords were hanging down in both the bedroom (near the bed) and the bathroom (2).."
3183,"I went with my brother in my wheelchair parking is ok if you get there early you should find parking near ground though, NFFC Bridgeford car park available.  Stewards where amazing friendly and helpful.  Right at the end of new stand cornered with pavillion end you find a lift too Balcony.  And an amazing view if you bad of sight like me a cheap pair ov binoculars very handy but good view of the ground all the same.

Stewardsvare so helpful and friendly jump to front of que if in chair stweards are more likely to approach you before you can them.

20/20 is a great night out I reccommend too all and will go again.  I saw people on scooters and powered chairs too at the game"
3184,Hired an accessible taxi to and from the airport. Accessible train stations nearby 
3185,"Accessible parking bays at each platform and step-free access to ticket desk and machines. There are bus stops nearby, although buses are not very frequent. Taxi ranks are also at both platforms, and on-street parking is available if car parks are full."
3186,"This is a fun shop on the Royal Mile. If you've been to Flying Tiger or Ale-Hop, this store reminds me of them. It is full of random stuff you never knew you wanted! "
3187,"We walked up the hill. It is a slope but manageable if you take your time browsing the many shops, closes and curiosities as you go. Just keep an eye out for the busking bag pipers as you have to wheel right in front of them and photo bomb the tourists’ pictures. "
3188,"Arrived in our car, disabled parking space adjacent to the hotel. A little difficulty with the gravel, needing to reverse up to the slabs in front of the doorway."
3189,Staff very helpful
3190,See https://www.nufc.co.uk/tickets/stadium-plan for further details 
3191,"Two disabled spaces, near loft."
3192,Very disappointed in this new Weatherspoons. It's in a listed building which has been beautifully restored with minimum consideration for accessibility.
3193,All amenities score a full 5
3194,Passable. Nothing special.
3195,Looked in the loo looked very good easy access inside one of the cottages
3196,"The restaurant is across three levels; two of which are accessible by wheelchair. 

Ground floor, Thistle Street entrance: 
Two heavy double doors and a bump greet you at entrance. If you are in a wheelchair, you will need assistance. The ground floor bar area comprises solely bar stool seating for approx 12 people. The stools are sturdy, have a back and are around 1 metre high. There are no wheelchair height tables in this area.

Level 1: Not wheelchair accessible.

Level 2: Accessible from back entrance on Thistle Street Lane. Plenty tables available at a wheelchair-friendly height."
3197,Car no parking 
3198,The entrance is not level access however a portable ramp can be brought out. There is a doorbell to alert the staff to bring this if they don’t see you at the door. There is some seating around the shop which I thought was great for someone who might need a rest.
3199,"Lots of buses go past, Knightsbridge Underground Station is close by (though I don't know if that has lifts or not). I don't know about parking"
3200, Both receptionists were helpful carrying our baggage and advising us where to visit and the restaurant staff also seemed fine. 
3201,"The disabled loo in reception is good but, turning in my powerchair, to lock the door is tight. The loo is very clean and well equipped with drop down support rails and grab handles. There is space on the right as you face the toilet for a  wheelchair to transfer, with enough room for a carer to assist.  Staff are aware of the need for the red alarm cord to hang freely to the floor."
3202,"Accessible toilet door opens away from the cafe but is in a corridor so it's slightly aukward. Lovely and clean and scented. 
For those needing a Changing Place this cafe is a few miles from Blair Drummond Safari park and Stirling "
3203,You need a vehicle. When there disabled parking. There is also a buggy to take mobility challenged directed to house.
3204,"Spacious bar and restaurant with a roaring log fire and super smoky aroma! Good disabled access, including an accessible toilet at the end of the bar and low tables with moveable seats to allow wheelchair access."
3205,As next to central station easy to get to would not recommend bringing a car as dear parking in the town 
3206,The toilet has an accessible sign and for some wheelchairs its shape might make it a bit awkward.
3207,Access in to the station and around the concourse is generally good. It can be difficult to work out where you want to go but the signposts are fairly good.
3208,"Absolutely fabulous staff who exceeded my expectations.  They were available readily except when booking in other people,  They assisted in carrying luggage and getting stuff packed into my van. Very much appreciated"
3209,King Cross Station
3210,"Fairly easy to find, at the back of the cafe. Okay space wise with grab rails however bins in the corner may have posed a problem to some. Very clean and well stocked. Red cord was tied up however I did leave a note about it so will hopefully be rectified."
3211,"There is a Radar Key Toilet on the Right hand side of the pier this is the side nearest the Tower.
It was clean and useable however the grip rails on both sides of the toilet its self were rusty and would advice care if using."
3212,There is on street parking and accidentally lowered (collapsed) kerbs with a very small parking area at the side. There are buses that go that way too as its not far from the health centre or braehead shopping centre but I can't comment on their reliability as I can't use public transport myself.
3213,"The bus station is near the City centre and as a result is near to shops and offices etc. It covers a large area with a large number of bus/ coach stands available.
Services from through Glasgow and other areas leave from this point, this bus station is also used for bus services to  Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and many more. It is also the pick up point for many of the coach tours holidays as well.  
There is a building at one end of the station that has shops café and toilets available there is one Radar key toilet available at this point. 
There are display boards that give information on which service is going from which stance above the doors."
3214,Decent accessible loos. Could do with a couple more.
3215,"Refused to listen, humiliated me in the reception area, kept telling me that what I was saying wasn’t true until I showed them. There was one concierge who was lovely, but the managers were awful. Weren’t prepared to help rectify the issues at all. No disability awareness, eg they kept saying things like ‘no one else has had any problems’ ‘another wheelchair got in the room’ ‘gave you tried getting into the room’. The default is also to charge disabled people double the usual room rate for an accessible room as they had to use a suite because of the space needed. "
3216,"Les Portes en Re, is the village at the far end of the island of Ile de Re. There is a market square and church. On the outskirts is a nature reserve. My review score reflects that I didn't visit the nature reserve so feel unable to comment about it, so giving it an average score."
3217,Easy to find and get to. Toilet was very large with lots of grab handles and would accommodate a wheelchair and a carer at the same time if so required. It was clean and tidy and everything worked when I visited .
3218,"All staff very clued-up, massively friendly, and they bend over backwards to be helpful."
3219,Plenty of room to park
3220,"Easy entry into hotel, on the level with an automatic sliding door. A lift is available, reasonable size, so you would cope. Nice seating by reception if tired and needing a drink."
3221,Overall this was a fantastic day out but I went with realistic expectations. Not everything is accessible but they have made a good attempt at most areas. The accessible bus was an absolute God-send and they prioritised this over other vehicles when coming out of lockdown.
3222,You need to travel by car. There are 4 disabled spaces close to the entrance. The spaces are on the end of 4 rows with hashed lines on just one side of each space so you need to make sure you partk the right way round to open the car door depending on whether the disabled person is the driver or passenger.
3223,this venue is totally accessible 
3224,"I didn't use parking, so I can't comment on that -  but there are plenty of bus stops close by, so public transport is quite straight forward."
3225,"A steep slope with railings , then completely flat, short walk to restaurant "
3226,"dedicated parking right outside the front door, all level no kerbs etc"
3227,Lovely Venue which was unfortunately let down by the access into it.  Once inside there is a large permanent ramp allowing access to all facilities inside and the staff went out of their way to do what they could to help.
3228,is on a pedestrianised street no parking outside but is close to numerous bus stops and also few minutes from Buchanan Street underground.
3229,Great level entry for a change !
3230,Most of the restaurant is accessible.
3231,Very large toilet with room for two carers. Door is touch button operated. Red cord had been cut or snapped half way down the wall so would be unreachable.
3232,All amazing (I only saw Banquet Records staff). 
3233,"As mentioned access into the hotel was at the rear near the disabled parking. You can enter through the front door if you are able to open a single door or have somebody with you to hold the door. The reception area had a low counter and plenty of space to move around.  There are lifts to all floors, access was fine on the corridors and the accessible room had everything we needed. Low-level furniture, tea making facilities and an adapted bathroom made it a comfortable room."
3234,"Extremely , friendly and helpful, very welcoming"
3235,In the main entrance there is a disbaled toliet and another one located in the cafe shop and courtyard cafe. And additional toliets are available in the Pavilion at the Alnwick Gardens.
3236,"Overall I thought the shopping centre was accessible to individuals which have various walking adaptations. Intu has a variety of shops  as well as different eateries and a large comfy cinema to offer. Lifts and escalators are available throughout the centre in order to access the different levels. In addition, all the entrances on the ground floor are accessible for wheelchair uses."
3237,Wheelchair accessible with helpful and friendly staff. Food is good and reasonably priced. Have eaten on many occasions and have not been let down.
3238,Knowledgable and helpful.
3239,"This review was written after attending the private preview of Smoke and Mirrors: The Psychology of Magic, the new Wellcome Collection exhibition which is on until 15 September 2019.
The exhibition explores  psychology and magical entertainment. It's fascinating and strongly recommend visiting. Wellcome Collection was Euan's Guide's venue of the Year 2018 so there's excellent access."
3240,"Entering the site you visit the small 'keepers' building by the main entrance. There's an exhibition, small shop and ticket point. You then pass out in to the Cathedral where a combination of mainly grass and some hard pathways give access around the site. There are some vantage point and areas that require you to climb steps but even missing these out there's a lot to see and experience as a wheelchair user."
3241,There are good-sized accessible toilets with grab rails in both the restaurant and function room.
3242,"There was a ramp into the building, and the rest of the building is flat. The highlight for us was the wheelchair accessible jungle gym which my son spent ages driving up, down and around. The first time in his 16 years of life he could 'climb' a jungle gym on his own. The rest of the equipment was designed to accommodate special needs children with assistance e.g. jumping castles, wheely-boards and swings they can lie on or be propped up on."
3243,"The door was a manual opening and it opened towards you, which is very difficult to do for a wheelchair person."
3244,"The first we encountered was without doubt the worst we have ever been in. It was too small. There were no proper grab rails. There was no alarm. The door wouldn't lock. You had to pass the other loos to get there. It wasn't very clean. Luckily we fund a perfectly acceptable loo in the Philharmonie, where we had lunch in the cafe. No alarm, but a decent amount of space, a grab rail, the possibility of side transfer and also very clean."
3245,The Village is a large modern purpose built hotel and leisure complex and was built in around 2014. Situated a fifteen-minute car journey from the city centre.
3246,Nice & clean. A little difficult to open door to get out.
3247,It's fst casual dining so the staff are very attentative to make sure you eat in good time with limited waiting. Food comes at different times but it all arrives less than ten minutes after ordering
3248,Absolutely fantastic.
3249,Plenty turning space in main bathroom and small toilet is manageable if needed
3250,"There are automatic entrance doors leading into reception, however, there are heavy manual doors leading out of the reception area towards the lift.  Staff always helped me with these doors; the lift is a bit tight for a powerchair and another passenger but it's just manageable for me.  The room itself was great for a non-disabled family room."
3251,They are usually very friendly and happy to help.
3252,"George, our 10 year old, with Aspergers said ""They treat us like normal, I love it here!""  

Anthony 6, our non verbal son had a whale of a time, feeding the animals, running around followed by the staff and having someone stand in the sea with him on a wet day for nearly 2 hours.

Our other son Alfie 7 had a great time just being himself.

We got a surprise afternoon off with a picnic from the staff, a bottle of bubbly and no children to go off and chill. 

Non-judgemental, with mentoring that helps you see how different approaches can aid everyday life.

The week had structure but activities evolved according to everyone's needs. Nothing was too much trouble and a passionate team who are there to provide the best time for everyone!

Can't wait to return to the best holiday we have ever had as a family!

Thank you, a true gem Kerry Farm!"
3253,The staff are very friendly and there for you. There is normally a manager on the floor if you do have a problem
3254,"The car park has disabled parking spots but can get busy, however there are usually spaces available. The car park is close to the museum entrance."
3255,"Some on street parking and good bus links. If you use a power chair like me, there are also two accessible tube stations nearby – Victoria and Westminster."
3256,"Getting into hotel entrance was not to difficult, although we could not manage it, and I had to get up and out of my wheelchair to get over a very small step, (photo 2) but others will make it seem easy. After a tight narrow bend at the end of a passage you have to get round, you can just get a normal sized wheelchair into the narrow lift (photo 4) with one other person, but anything larger we feel would not get into lift. Most of the rooms on upper floors have narrow passageways and bends to have to 
get round, (photo 6) however, if you can be bothered to try this hotel after our words, we feel you would enjoy your stay, and it is most certainly the most convenient hotel near to Waverley station and Princess street buses.
The bedroom was very good, large enough, with storage space for wheelchair, and a nice large bathroom which can hold your chair."
3257,Ok but a bit of a walk 
3258,"No steps into the hotel and bar area, lots of  space"
3259,Excellent access with automatic doors & wide walkway / reception area
3260,staff were friendly and helpful
3261,"Accessible toilets in the Trafford centre are good, I didn’t notice any changing place toilets but I didn’t check so there could still be changing place toilets in the Trafford centre but not sure"
3262,"There are no steps to negotiate to get to the area set aside for wheelchairs and mobility scooters.  There are ramps at the rear of each stand leading to the disabled seating areas. For people with disabilities other than mobility ones, there are steps to the seating areas. "
3263,It is easily accessible from Newburgh High Street and the cafe is all on one level. 
3264,The staff were friendly and helpful 
3265,lovely spot to sit and have lunch
3266,Technically wheelchair accessible.
3267,The toilet is a good size and well maintained.
3268,Staff are friendly and helpful. Not sure they have any specific disability awareness training however they are pleasant enough.
3269,"We found that getting there by public transport was going to be difficult, so we went on an organised trip.
As promised a wheelchair accessible tour bus picked us up and then dropped us at a stepped entrance at Smart city with the driver pointing out a door where we would get a lift down to the Laguna walk area..  There was a man in the building but he ignored our indications that we wanted to use the lift.  The bus driver saw this and came and had an ‘animated talk’ with the man in Maltese but the man was not budging.    
At this, the bus driver loaded us back onto the bus (the steepest ramp I used on holiday – it was an old double decker) and took us down to the car park at the lower level, indicating that he would pick us up from this point."
3270,"There is no designated disabled parking, but the car park is a large open space right in front of the building and is also free. The car park has two small speed bumps tucked in on the side of the area, but apart from that the ground is all level."
3271,"There is one toilet in the venue for everyone  it is located opposite the door you come in there is not a lot of space to let people pass you as they come out of the toilet or you go in.
There are 2 doors both open outwards the first from the main venue area opens on to a small square area of about 3 or 4 feet to get to the second door once through this door you will find a good basic toilet however there is not a lot of space if someone needs assistance in anyway."
3272,"Exceptionally friendly staff , very wellcoming"
3273,Lots of disabled Parking right outside main doors
3274,Very helpful.
3275,No steps. All accessible.
3276,"Michael Hoppen Gallery is a small fine art photography gallery, in Chelsea, just off King's Road. Disabled access was very poor."
3277,"Staff amazing, faultless
The lady who served us ? the owner is an amazing host
Kind , welcoming and efficient.
Gave the personal touch and made us feel special"
3278,"Staff put the icing on the cake. Every single one was helpful, courteous and personable."
3279,Theatre is very accessible with a ramp out front and doors which open when the large button is pressed. The floor in the theatre is nice and flat but some parts have thick carpet and a large slope to get to the bar at the back.
3280,"Very helpful, friendly and directed me to where I needed to be. They were lovely!"
3281,5* staff - very professional as you would expect. Also very friendly.
3282,Good turning space in the access area. 
3283,"I am pretty sure if you rang them from road or car and explained your situation they'd bring you you food out as they seem friendly enough to me. 
"
3284,"Mickley Hall is a multi activity shooting ground,with clay shooting archery and air rifle targets Inc field targets.
 Owners John and Scott will do their best to accommodate you what ever your disability, the paths are all compact hard stone and I have no problems getting around in my power chair,a manual one would be as easy as the ground is mostly flat and level."
3285,"On street parking but being near the city centre it is restricted.
There is a good bus service that passes the door."
3286,"What a pleasant visit to a very nice store. It has a large car park (photo 1) with four disabled bays right by entrance. The area is flat and easy for wheelchair to get inside the courtyard (photo 2). Through the brick paved attractive courtyard , a double automatic door leads out towards the garden centre (photo 3), and it’s an easy push along. (photo 4) shows wide, open spaces out in the garden  area, but some of the flagstones are very uneven, but no problems for us. Good selection of plants and all looked well after. Wide paths led you to the stoneware goods (photo 5) with bird baths, pots, troughs etc.
The pathway led us into the indoor section of the store (photo 6) with wide doorway and easy access. Again inside the wide spaces allowed us to get around on a stone flagged floor (photo 7)  which held barbecue displays, and cane furniture and baskets.
Leaving the garden centre, over paved level slabs and brickwork pathways (photo 8)  
You enter the courtyard again. (photo 9).  Now we see the entrance to the Coppice shopping area (photo 10) which holds homeware items. First is the jewellery department (photo 11)  again with wide spaces to be able to move.   (photo 12) had a nice selection and mix of general homeware,  I.e artificial flowers, vases, bowls and bits and pieces.
Departing (photo 13) at the far end of the store, we reached the disabled toilet (photo 14). It’s cleanliness was outstanding, pull cords and grab rails (photo 15).
Alongside was a delightful restaurant  named the “Fig and Olives” (photo 16)  very wide and easy entrance. We found a lovely coffee shop and bar (photo 17) and we enjoyed our coffee break (photo 18) with plenty of room for our wheelchair.
There is a large very popular restaurant divided into two sections (photo 19) both attractively laid out with wooden tables and chairs (photo 20).

Our final thoughts
A throughly enjoyable visit. A well laid out garden centre, and the department store was fascinating to browse through, though a bit expensive. The restaurant is extremely popular, and we strongly recommend booking early for breakfast and lunch time. Coffee break is a must, even if you don.t plan to eat there. A good hour or so can be spent enjoying these facilities, and we really do recommend you visiting when in the Sutton Coldfield area. Top marks for the way they have thought of disabled visitors, don’t miss it."
3287,"There are two accessible toilets. At one end of the car park is a RADAR locked toilet, which is very basic and not really maintained now. However, it is often cleaner than the main one.

Next to the cafe is an accessible toilet which is open to all. I think this is also the baby changing facility. It is currently used by all, due to Covid restrictions, and is therefore busy and often not as clean as it should be. Due to the nature of the park attracting many young people, we have often found groups of teenies playing in the toilet and had to wait ages for them to come out."
3288,"The seats are all different here but at least they are moveable. They are all different heights, weights and sizes so, like Goldilocks, you should find one that's just right. They have double doors that are generally kept open but they are light to push open. They have ridged wooden panels throughout the bar and the bathrooms are tiled. There is one small step at the main door but it is easy to tip the chair up to it.  The ladies bathroom is up a few steps and the gents is down a few but the wheelchair bathroom is on ground level."
3289,The toilets were closed at 5pm which is fair enough really as we are not really in summer yet. I saw a park attendant Tony who was very helpful and I asked him if he could open them for me. He was extremely friendly and helpful.
3290,The accessible loo is adjacent to the other toilets and easy to find. The door is wide and easy for me to open and close from my wheelchair. Once inside there is plenty of room to transfer with plenty of supports and grab handles. The room has always been very clean on every occasion that I have used it.
3291,"Ramps at back and front of the complex, working lift, if puicift is out, complex staff will help you safely  use the goods entrance and lift.
Toilets at cinema are fully accessible (2, one is a family change room too) never seen a tied up cord and transfer area is clear.
Staff are more than happy to help with doors to the screens. "
3292,"Automatic doors, level entrance into reception, bar and breakfast area.  Lift to rooms.  Disabled room had a heavy door, access onto bed by wheelchair was from one side only.  There was 2 red cords in the room and 2 red cords in the accessible toilet, with a great shower with seat and 4 grab rails.  2 sinks 1 lower. "
3293,There is one large toilet cubicle at the Pig and Pastry which is sufficient to say the size of the cafe is fairly small. It is down a narrow corridor however big enough for wheelchair access if needed. Not the  easiest access to a toilet but certainly able to do so.
3294,"As I do not require this facility I didn’t check, but I’m informed by the ground they have an accessible toilet "
3295,I am unaware of parking facilities as I came by bus. The 35 bus heading into the city stops outside. There is a slight incline going up this way. 
3296,Access is generally very good although some aisles were a little tight or you had to navigate past a few extra rails that were out.
3297,The ship does have an accessible toilet but not having used it I can't comment further.
3298,"Great access, friendly staff, good loos, moveable furniture. - and a great view to top it all off!"
3299,"Great overall, but so disappointing that the crew could not find the ramp for my son to access the outside deck - he missed the view of the receding mainland and the sea....had to stay inside all trip,"
3300,"There was a sign to indicate disabled parking.  The main door has steps leading up to a flat area of shop and restaurant - open and airy.  The tables are far enough apart to be able to move round in a wheelchair and the staff are helpful.
There is a side door with a ramp which makes the restaurant accessible with some assistance if using a manual wheelchair - it is a little steep."
3301,Helpful friendly staff.
3302,"Asked a member of staff where the accessible loo was, and it was then easy enough to find. The one I went to opened with my Radar key (so no manky nappies inside - good) and it was clean with plenty of rails."
3303,Staff were very helpful and knowledgeable. They explained that certain parts of our order would be served first and asked if that was ok. They were  willing to assist with opening doors and moving chairs etc.  making it a great experience for our guests.
3304,"Very disabled friendly except: car parking by the entrance is only for four cars. There is further disabled parking but I found I had to go on the road for a short distance.
Staff very helpful. Ramps to all stairs, lift between the exhibition floor and the shop/exit. Much of the site is grass, but this is well maintained and easy to navigate in a wheelchair. 

Overall, it was a very enjoyable visit."
3305,"Due to the layout/design of the building, toilets are situated pool-side (though bear in mind this is an Edwardian building). There is a disabled access toilet and changing facilities."
3306,"Often it is the people who make a visit feel good. Urquhart Castle is amongst those great places and spaces that do this. We were made to feel welcome, people were keen to tell us what there was to see, and folk were chatty and helpful."
3307,"There is an accessible toilet however, I do not feel it is very big and I think if someone needs assistance from someone else you could struggle. There is also not an emergency red cord in this accessible toilet but I reported this to staff and they are going to look into it.

Luckily there is an amazing Changing Places toilet been installed during the new refurbishments. I was amazed at the size of this room and I think because it has high ceilings as well it makes it feel so much bigger. There is a H shaped ceiling tracking hoist that covers the whole room and there is a bed folded up against one of the walls. You can see from the photo below that there is plenty of space to transfer to the toilet even if you don’t need to use the hoist. The bins were beside the toilet but we said how this can cause problem for people transfer and they moved the bins and said they will put tape on the floor so staff and cleaners know where they need to be placed. There are grab rails at each side of the toilet and the sink is height adjustable. This Changing Place toilet can be accessed by a RADAR key and if you don’t have one you can get it from the front desk."
3308,"It’s all step free through out with a one way system for entry and exit for Covid safety. There is no seating except in the cafe which is a good size. The chairs and tables are well spaced. There is a great selection of food drom homemade scones and cakes through a breakfast and lunch options.

Dogs are welcome in one part of the cafe."
3309,"This is like the Rolls Royce of public toilets. The toilets were huge and I could not believe how much state of the art equipment had been funded for this park: changing beds, overhead tracking hoist, two showers (fully accessible), loads of grab rails in all of the right places. More than anything it was clean, well maintained and i just wish all public toilets were like this."
3310,There are only a few disabled parking spaces but free on road parking is available and there are plenty of drop kerbs for wheelchairs.
3311,Poor uneven surfaces making it difficult for those who use manual wheelchairs 
3312,"Easy to find. Level access to large area, not cluttered, several grab rails but grubby and in need of repair - toilet roll holder broken, soap dispenser empty and inadequate air dryer-  plus little loo roll and no paper towels"
3313,"The accessible room and lifts were fine but the experience was overshadowed by the problems getting in and out of the building. It was humiliating. We wanted to use the hotel as a base to explore Brighton but we’re worried about whether, in the storms that weee outside, we would be able to get back in. "
3314,Perfect for me. Integrated within the general male/female toilets so definitely not an afterthought. (Well done!).
3315,Large restaurant and bakery with lots of quirky decor and fantastic cakes. Conveniently has a bus stop right outside and a wide ramp into the building.
3316,"Mobility scooters are available for a donation.

There is seating all around the garden, so plenty of rest spots.

If you're walking, there are a small number of steps out from the shop, accessing the gardens themselves.

There are some steep walks if you're fit enough."
3317,Helpful lady at the refreshment kiosk helped hubby carry drinks for myself and elderly folk with us.
3318,"We went to Middletons for my sons graduation meal and were not disappointed. 
The staff were very friendly, the food was delicious and really good value for money.
I will definitely think about returning there for another occasion."
3319,"Excellent trip, helpful staff who applied courtesy & common sense. 90 minute trip (we had good weather) good commentary, saw seals. Thoroughly enjoyed."
3320,"I use these facilities a fair bit, when shopping, and every visit the cord has either been broken or tied up. So now I have the cards, I've placed one there!! Apart from cord I can get in easy enough either manual or electric wheelchair, have also managed to get small scooter in there! "
3321,Canary Wharf station does have accessible toilet facilities. These we're closed during my visit due to some building works.
3322,Very helpful and keen that the distillery to be accessible to as many people as possible.
3323,Lots of parking. Blue Badge spaces right outside pub door.
3324,"Access is level and via the church’s shop, which has good circulating space.  The doors are wide and automatic. Once in the church itself you need to be aware that the floor consists of stone slabs which are somewhat uneven and quite hard going in places. There are some side chapels which are not wheelchair-accessible but a wheelchair visitor can see and enjoy most of the building’s features."
3325,"There was abundant parking, in mown fields, being chalk down land the surface was adequate for my mobility scooter."
3326,Very helpful and aware .
3327,"This is a fairly new venue and has been thoughtfully designed.  My husband cannot walk well and mobility scooters can be hired for £10 a visit if you do not own one.  The car parking is not far from the main entrance and is a flat path to the main door.  However, the whole site we found to be accessible.  Even though we visited in December, the gardens still had plenty of interest with wide flat paths and wide-open views, even so near a city.   The wilder area was accessible for the mobility scooter but may be a little difficult with a wheelchair.  However, there is plenty of space and garden area to roam about without needed to go further out into the parkland.  The entrance area, shop and cafe are all open-plan with plenty of space for wheelchairs and scooters to move about.  This made it easy to visit the shop and cafe.  The cafe was excellent with lovely food both for carnivores and vegetarians.  It is possible to park and just visit the cafe and shop without paying for the entrance to the gardens.  The toilets are in the main open-plan space.  Staff were helpful.   Highly recommended for a day out.  We went by car so I cannot comment on public transport to the venue."
3328,This is a very accessible coffee shop on the first floor of Union Square shopping centre. 
3329,"Accessible loo available in café, clear sign posting provided and a spacious clean tidy bathroom with handrails and room for a carer. "
3330,"Excellent food, flat access. Great staff"
3331,"I walk here, there is a bit of a climb up a gradient up to Lauriston Place where theres a few Lothian Buses - 23, 27, 45 and 35. "
3332,"When you find one, it’s usually ok, enough room, busy, so sometimes not as you would like toilets to be, it just depends on time you visit. A lot of times, I have had to use ordinary public toilets  and make do."
3333,"Pleasant visit. Very helpful staff.
"
3334,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately away near Waitrose on Link Rd approximately 150m away. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
3335,I booked this apartment online. I don't need a completely accessible apartment as I can stand for short periods and walk short distances. The complex is reached from the main coast road by a short but steep access road. There is a code to open the gate. An electronic key will unlock the door to the building but someone has to open it as it doesn't open electronically. There is a lift with a very low step in front of the doors - I estimate around 2cm. The bathroom is not accessible. My husband had to push me up the steep access road at least once a day for a week. He is very fit but it was still a strain.
3336,"Level entry and double doors to access. Doors are heavy and not automatic but they are by reception desk and the staff are always on the lookout for musicians with equipment so are really fast to open the doors and welcome you in.
All studio spaces have wide enough doors to comply with access requirements and its all on the level. One of the rooms has a stage area which does not have wheelchair access but the staff are quick and efficient at configuring the room to suit by placing drumkit, mics etc on the floor level area if no other room is available. Lighting levels are low throughout."
3337,Using both public transport and driving to get to this venue was great with no issues. 
3338,"When we arrived in Aberdeen at the ferry terminal, there was plenty parking close by, although we were taking the car onboard the ferry so we were parked in the queue waiting to drive on board. 
When collecting our tickets, if you’ve told them in advance you have accessible needs, they give you a notice to hang from your inside mirror that tells the staff directing you to board with your car that you need to be parked near to the lift that takes you up to reception.
A helpful tip Would be, if you are a wheelchair user to also tell the staff directing you on board that you are a wheelchair user and you need extra space to vacate your car, or you need extra space behind to allow for your ramp or hoist etc, as they can sometimes cram the cars in and you are in with cars all around you before you know it.
There is a train station approximately a 10 min walk from the ferry.
I am unsure about the bus service as this was not used."
3339,Polite did the job but did not tell us until after drinks no loo for disabled.
3340,"The toilets were nice, they just had moveable handles. Their was a nice amount of space. If you needed a hoist or something along those lines it's not suitable though just to bear in mind."
3341,"Beautiful historic church, light and airy inside. Wheelchair entrance is on the far side as you approach, round three sides of the building to get to it due to fence/wall. Main entrance has a few steps outside and more inside. Entrance is a little narrow. Lift will take you down to accessible toilet and nursery, or up to main church. Balcony area has separate steps and is not wheelchair-accessible, but is not used for most services. There are two steps up to reach the main altar for communion, or clergy will bring it to you if you let someone know at the beginning of the service, or you can go to the side altar. There isn't a separate wheelchair area, but the aisles are wide enough to sit next to the end of a pew. There is a project planned to shorten some pews to make better wheelchair spaces, details posted in the south aisle."
3342,"The grounds are pretty accessible, the actual castle not good! The walled garden by the car park is lovely. Paths are good around the walled garden. There is a tearoom at the castle - take the road to the left to avoid the gravel! The tea room is a bit of a squeeze but there are tables outside, and on a sunny day it is lovely. ( cakes and soup are great!). "
3343,Blue Badge holders are able to park right at the entrance to the house. Again as with other attractions in the area driving is definitely encouraged as public transport might be tricky.
3344,Terrible not easy to find nearest loos to entrance for ladies are up stone steps no ramp no rails
3345, If you have a disabled blue badge then you can park on the single yellow line outside the hotel.  Alternatively there is a small carpark behind the hotel which has one disabled space.
3346,The nearest station is 5-10 minute walk so not suitable if you have mobility difficulties.
3347,"No accessible toilet upstairs. In the conservatory there was a good sized accessible toilet, clean and tidy, sink at good height but light is very high up. "
3348,Clearly marked bays near entrance. 
3349,"The cottage was carefully built with disability in mind so I could more around freely everywhere, inside and outside the house. Love d the wide wooden doors. "
3350,"Level access cafe, work shops performance space."
3351,"There are lifts, but also alot of steps that are not well light in the dark on the upstairs balcony seating. signage is not positioned well and could do with being in a larger print"
3352,"I parked in multi-story car park attached to the Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre where the Royal Yacht Britannia is located. We parked on level E which was recommend because that is the level you enter the Royal Yacht Britannia box office on. There was plenty of accessible parking on this level of the multi-story car park however, it was very dark when driving around and difficult to see the parking spaces. I noticed later on that the lights are environmentally friendly lights that go on when you get near them which is good but, I feel it was quite dangerous, especially walking/driving out with the car with other cars driving around.

Due to not being from this area I don’t know anything about where or what public transport is available but, there is plenty of information available on the Royal Yacht Britannia website."
3353,Staff are very welcoming and friendly. Venue is great fun and great range of equipment.
3354,Being in the heart of the community the Cathedral is easily accessible by public transport. I arrived having come of the Jubilee Line tube at London  Bridge. Not too far to wheel along to the Cathdral.
3355,Accessible parking in carpark centre but not very close. A good bus service runs to the shopping precinct.
3356,"I came here last year (2018) for Christmas dinner and everything was exceptional, see my previous review. However this time the service was not very good. When I arrived a lady pointed in the direction of the accessible toilets, the nearest were near the bar. When I arrived at La Rotonde restaurant there was a short queue ahead of me. When I gave my name I was told I was not on the list. (This although I had booked and pre-paid for my dinner). The waiter went to get their manager and then I was offered a seat. I accepted a seat in the garden. It was warm enough to sit outside for Christmas dinner. However, I then waited 30 minutes, before I caught the attention of one of the members of staff and asked why no one had come to serve me. I was informed they assumed I was waiting for someone. I explained I was on my own and that they could have asked me or checked my booking. In either way I would expect better service at a 5 star hotel as I would have expected at the least to have been offered a drink while I was waiting. After that service improved remarkably. I had ordered a vegetarian menu and there were 5 course, each one was superb. "
3357,There is access via a small and overly severe ramp at the door. Once inside access to lower level only (five or six tables).  Disabled loo on the site about twenty metres away.  Food was nice though a bit pricey for what it was and small choice for veggies.
3358,Staff are very helpful and friendly
3359,"Chester Zoo has 100 disabled parking bays at the front of the car park closest to the main entrance to allow easy access to and from the zoo. This car park is tarmac and therefore suitable for wheelchair users or those with visual impairments. 
Buses are available to/from Chester city and train station, these operate on a regular basis and have disabled access. However there is a longer walk to this stop from the main enterance"
3360,Amazing staff a asset to the hotel. Helped find my perfect room. 
3361,"Our first visit here recently was to see the excellent B52s.
Upon arrival we were greeted by one of the dedicated accessibility staff and after a quick search we were escorted to our disabled area, which was to the far left of the auditorium and at a height that afforded a clear view of the stage  There was full step free access from street to viewing area with no portable ramps to contend with.
We were first to the disabled area and had our pick of where to pitch ourselves; we took up a position at the front of it, about sixty feet from the stage. The disabled area rises towards the back of it so those sat behind us had a good view too; I had to remember not to stand up and strut my stuff!

I took the opportunity to have a look around the auditorium and foyer before the masses descended; it really is a lovely looking venue and has had a sympathetic restoration befitting of its glory days.

The nearest bar to us was probably about forty feet away and although it was quiet to start with, when more people came in a wheelchair user would have had a struggle getting to the bar without taking out a few feet and ankles along the way. I didn't notice a lowered counter at the bar, nor was a 'drinks to your seat' service offered.

The good sized accessible toilet was next to the disabled area, literally fifteen feet away from us. It required a Radar key, preventing it from being abused, and was also being policed by the dedicated staff near to us.

At the end of the concert we didn't have to wait for the crowd to clear as there were exit doors really close to us that led straight outside.
"
3362,"For a large open space, park, the access is fairly good with a well surfaced pathway adjacent to all of the roads, an accessible toilet in the Education building, and an information centre."
3363,"Excellent, everyone I met was very helpful and friendly and did everything they could to make my experience as smooth as possible. They were happy to lower their masks so I could lipread and provided any important information to me in written form to make sure I could fully understand. "
3364,"The city centre is pretty easy mostly for wheelchairs, as it's flat. There are disabled parking bays nearby on New Inn Hall Street and Beamont Street. You can also park in residents' only bays if you have a blue badge."
3365,Loo was clean spacious and well appointed
3366,"The paths are fine and it's easy enough to get round the park, but as I said in my main write-up, don't get your hopes up about access to the actual rides."
3367,"Great hotel right next to queen street station. Couldn't be more central. Staff were so helpful nothing was a issue for them. First hotel I've been in that actually went through a PEEP (fire evacuation plan) which I thought was great and made me feel very comfortable staying there. We had booked an accessible room and it was huge! Lots of space to move around and the bathroom was very accessible with the wet room being very suitable with handrails etc.. Picture below. 
The only issue we had was there was no sockets beside the bed to plug in my medical equipment I need overnight. But we went went to reception and asked for an extension cable which we got no bother. Overall a great stay and will definitely be back."
3368,"Waterfront ground floor property which is fully accessible with wet floor shower ,garden and parking. Ideal for fishing ,sailing etc"
3369,No complaints here. I just wish that staff understood why disabled drivers need them to help with monitoring of the only disabled parking bay.
3370,Staff seemed to be knowledgeable so could help you find a suitable plant and how to look after it. They also seemed happy to help. 
3371,"Accessible in all areas, interesting, a wildlife haven that is made for both the able bodied and the not able bodied. Not only did we see over 200 wild kites being fed, we saw sparrows, siskins, goldfinches and many other small birds feeding, beautiful flora and forna. The lake had damsel flies in abundance and fish were even jumping. It was a true paradise."
3372,Very helpful and courteous 
3373,"It doesn’t get any better than this.  Met at the entrance by a welcoming marshal who directed us to the disabled parking bays next to the entrance, a dedicated entrance for disabled visitors where we found level access, loads of spaces and clearly marked signage stating ‘free parking for disabled.’"
3374,There could have been more signage for disabled access but it was still widely available which was good to see. There could of been more braille.
3375,"Staff were very helpful  and knowledgeable gave a good account of life in the iron age, explained things slowly and clearly. They did advise us before starting the fire making demonstration so we could move to front with wheelchair."
3376,Most of the staff are lovely and understanding and will do anything to adapt to your needs.
3377,"The disabled access is very good. The only slight downside is that there are a couple of doors to open to get through to the bar area. However, the friendly bar staff would definitely help out if necessary. "
3378,There is a steep hill outside reception.
3379,"Behind the building is one disabled parking space, directly to the back entrance. You might need to call them with your phone to open the back door for you depending on your disability."
3380,Level access from entrance and  throughout this the tables are very well spaced so during my visit it was very easy to get to the toilet and exit without disturbing anybody else..
3381,"Excellent access to seats and viewing platforms. The venue are able to accommodate some last minute changes if these are necessary. The area is very flat and easy to walk/wheel on. The fact that there was a queue of wheelchair and mobility impaired for the disabled loos means they are definitely being used, but may need some more accessible loos. "
3382,"There are lifts and several bathrooms specifically designed for people with physical disabilities, making it a comfortable environment. "
3383,Friendly and helpful.
3384,There is easy access to both venues and there is a ramp within the Roma Restaurant to access the Disabled Toilet as well.  The Beardmore Hotel is accessible throughout with great door widths and disabled toilets situated around the hotel and restaurants.
3385,"This is a modern hotel, so everything for disabled people is considered in building it
There are 2 rooms for people with very limited abilities.
I found the rooms I stayed in had a huge bathroom with a bath and separate shower and two hand basins"
3386,Disabled parking next to the leisure club but i chose to park further away to enjoy the walk to the leisure club entrance.Driving here is essential unless you stay close and get a taxi.
3387,"The head waiter/barman whose name I unfortunately did not catch was welcoming, attentive, and entertaining.  The younger foreign waitresses were good although there were slight problems communicating between Polish, Geordie and Scottish.  All adding to the entertainment.  The morning breakfast squad were in the main locals and also very friendly cheerful and professional."
3388,So good. Really helpful
3389,"Once you are in, wheelchair spaces are fine. However, wheelchair access to the venue is via a ramp at the rear of the tent. To get there you must be accompanied by staff along a bumpy, muddy path by the bins - not the most glamorous!"
3390,The loo is very easy to find. The door to where the toilets are located is heavy and does not open electronically. Once inside the accessible toilet is left unlocked so no problem if you don't have a radar key and users are spared the indignity of having to ask. The toilet was very clean. There is a baby changing shelf but not one suitable for an adult. The red cord was in place and reached to the floor.
3391,I was in the main stand disabled area and it is very good as there are toilets right behind you and a cover so you don't get wet when it rains. 
3392,"60 minute boat trip taking in many Copenhagen's famous sites. The low overall review is due to lack of good access, however if I was rating the attraction itself I would give it 5 out of 5 as it is a delightful way to explore the city."
3393,Toilets are a free for all and not monitored. During our visit local workmen were in and out  as we other members of the public. Unacceptable.
3394,"Floor a bit grubby, cord tied at curling height, bins by toilet."
3395,"There are two accessible toilets, one male and one female. The toilet is spacious, clean and with grab rails. There is an emergency red cord alarm with a sign saying it needed to hang freely but the cord had been cut short. "
3396,"Bicester hotel stands in the lovely countryside of Oxfordshire, mainly flat, wooded country lanes and farmland, with easy access off junction 9 of the M40, which will help you to soon arrive at this lovely honey coloured Cotswold stone built 4 star hotel.

For your afternoon treat, why not enjoy an afternoon tea in Grays lounge (do pre-book) which will also offer you a relaxed casual dining experience, and may we recommend having a delightful martini prepared especially for you, perhaps trying their apple pie martini, or the lovely treat of a expresso martini. Do have a try !
 Of course, for dinner, the premier experience will be to dine in Greys restaurant, refurbished now with a chic contemporary style, with lakeside views.

We feel you will love this delightful Cotswold hotel, and then why not follow your visit here by driving the few miles to Bicester shopping village for an afternoon of window shopping in the most delightful of all village shopping outdoor malls in the country. (We have previously reviewed this 5 star shopping village for you ) do read our comments.

OUR REVIEW
The entrance to the estate is very appealing with its warm honey coloured Cotswold stone and nicely kept gardens (photo 1) as you drive up towards the hotel entrance and the car park (photo 2). Here you will find four disabled bays (3) and a childrens play outdoor play area.
A very nice entrance to the main door, paved but easy to be pushed along (photo 4).
A delightful courtyard awaits (5) with a door into the childrens crèche, so if anyone wants to play golf, they can leave their children very safely looked after.
A level entrance; but a double pull handle door to get through (6) which leads you into a beautiful reception desk and area (7).  A door ahead of you leads into the Bar (8) and a comfortable lounge area to sit and relax in (9). There are many paintings on the walls, some may be golfers of course (10). The sports bar leads out to the terrace (11) which is a very nice terrace (photo 12) which overlooks the golf course and it’s 11 lakes.

The reception leads towards the Brasserie (13) which is a very pleasant dining room to eat in (14) a ideal spot to have breakfast (15)  and looks out over to the gardens.
The breakfast bar (photo 16) where you would get a good selection of food, with lovely views over gardens and pool as you are eating. (17).
The highlight is Greys restaurant which is a delightful room, with its own bar (photo 18)  very warm looking and inviting (photo 19) with its lovely deco and warm theme that are very attractive (20).

OUR FINAL THOUGHTS
Handy to get to off the motorway, it’s a delightful place to stop for a coffee break or something to eat. All on the level, very pleasing to the eye, and very comfortable."
3397,"Reasonable wheelchair access although as a new building you'd think they could provide a changing places toilet in main section of hospital. 

This review is about the main section of hospital. They have an M&S to left of the entrance and a Costa to the right. There is an information desk to discuss car parking.  PALs is also located here opposite Costa. "
3398,"An accessible toilet was adjacent to the standard toilets in the lower level. Access to this was on request as it was kept locked. It was spacious, had grab rails and was clean and tidy."
3399,I have been visiting the RNT for years and have always found the staff to be very helpful and friendly.
3400,"Great staff, professional and discreet-nothing was too much trouble."
3401,"Upon visiting Nandos at 55 St Enoch Square, Glasgow, it was obvious that there was some room for improvement inside. The main door/entrance is wide, can be fully opened and is on a flat level leading in from the street. The waiting area and the main seating area are fairly spacious although ease of movement could be determined by how far out a chair is whilst in use. The two main downfalls are that the main counter for ordering food is quite high and would seem to require the customer to be standing to see the staff. Also the self-service drink dispensers are in a narrow corner of the restaurant and access back to the tables is narrow and is lined with tables and bar stools. The main toilets are located at the top of stairs. "
3402,Very helpful
3403,Parking available outside on Elm Row. Bus stops on the main road with buses going down to Leith and up to Princes Street/Newington. Bus stops around the corner to and from London Rd.
3404,This is the only thing I say is an issue because we drive a van and the parking has a barrier across with a hight limit
3405,Access throughout the complex was fair apart from the bedrooms. Booked a wet room specifically and arrived to find it had been allocated to someone else. Offered a large family room instead - on investigation couldn't even get in the bathroom! The offered an accessible room with a bath - couldn't get near the sink or alongside the bed to transfer ... This was deemed acceptable on the hotel's part but was a night of little comfort or sleep for me! Could not recommend this hotel because of this experience. Did get transferred on the second day to a room with a wet room but too late to compensate for the experience.
3406,Friendly helpful staff and accessible for a wheelchair.
3407,"An oasis of colourful calm amid the usual bustle of a Tyrolean town.  The mountains make a beautiful backdrop to these lovely gardens.  Even if you're not into horticulture (as indeed I am not), you can't fail to appreciate the shrubs, lakes, nature terraces or indeed the central cafe."
3408,"We used this bar as our base.  The tented area at the back is great for getting ready to hit the slopes and has room for us to leave wheelchairs and bags. Not the warmest space but they do have little heater to take off the worst of the chill.

Easy to ski in/out of and plenty of racks to store skis and poles.

Only problem for the wheelchairs was the two steps down to the main bar and toilets from the tent.  Not a problem for our group as we had some strong helpers.

Lift up from the main hotel is a little small.  The manual chairs were ok, my larger electric chair struggled, we had to remove the footplate to fit.

Lunch was good, food is basic but filling and an ok price, think schnitzel, soups, chicken nuggets etc.  Again beer and gluhwein are cheaper than soft drinks."
3409,An accessible toilet was located in the corridor as you approach the bar and restaurant. It was large enough for me to get in but not to turn a full circle.
3410,No lift. Ramp to entrance.
3411,Parking is on street but there is plenty nearby.  
3412,"This is a new venture by the Salvation Army and is part training facility and part exhibition covering the story of the song written by John Lennon Strawberry fields for ever. 
The exhibition is interactive and takes you through the story around the song and John Lennon who used to climb over the wall to play football.
The exhibition looks at the children's home that was on the site and you will see pictures of the home as well.
There is also a garden area with very long ramps that make it easy to go round the garden in one area you will find the original Red Gates in a spot as near to there original location as can be due to redevelopment in the area. 
The interactive part continues in the garden and also has music written by John Lennon etc.
The venue also has a café that is employing people with a range of disabilities to give them training and support.
Of course there is also a shop as you would expect with these type of exhibitions .
This venue only opened around 8 weeks ago however I am sure it will be come very popular by the time Spring Summer 2020 comes along"
3413,"Helpful staff, but not always there. Space is rented by various groups."
3414,Loads of disabled bays  right in front of the store
3415,Staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough to help. Really pleased!
3416,"This is a leisure centre in Edinburgh that is split over three levels. It is just about wheelchair accessible, with lift access to the top floor, but is really quite cramped inside. "
3417,"Flat entrance through automatic doors. Lift to all floors, although a little concerned that accessible rooms are not on ground floor in case of fire. (We were on 3rd floor and there was at least one accessible room above us). Room had laminated flooring throughout which made using a hoist a breeze"
3418,"I'm not sure about loop or large print or braille. I could do with large print, but take my reading glasses."
3419,"I like going to Starbucks because I know what I can eat/drink with my allergies and the interior is almost always the same, so helps me keep calm when going to a new city (as I'm Autistic). This one has really annoyed me because they had a refit recently. What they did was the put a number lock on the toilets but did not put one on the disabled loos, or even a RADAR lock. This is because many people will nip in off the square to use their loo. When I go in now and need the toilet I have to wait whilst someone finishes who just couldn't be bothered to go get the number. It's also very difficult to get a drink as quite often they are rushing people along and don't want to give you the time to put money away (hard if you're on crutches) and blame you if they get your order wrong because ""you didn't speak loud enough"" and a variety of other excuses."
3420,"Someone else has already mentioned that there is no dropped kerb. There still isn't but it isn't a big kerb and with my Freewheel, I got up it without help. It is a busy road though and I appreciated having hubby with me to help decide when it was safe to cross. 

The top section of the path is quite steep and has a loose gravel surface. I was okay going down but huby had to help push back up as my wheels kept skidding under me. The rest of the path was good quality - concrete. There is a fence on the side where the drop is, which looks good quality but allows someone at wheelchair height to still see the view. 

The last section has steep steps and so isn't at all accessible but I felt that the view was fine from the top of those steps.

Strange access issue, I know... but I can't be the only one with both a phobia and serious allergy to nettles... the path is wide enough to get through without getting stung but they aren't exactly cut back and at the beginning of July were a lot taller than me! If it had been windy, I'd have probably not dared go through. "
3421,As we parked in the service road as our van (WAV) is 2.2m high we did't need to go into the car-park.
3422,"Most of the venue is accessible but some of the dining area is up a step so if you want to eat do book a table in advance. 
Menu not really suitable if you have complicated dietary requirements or are coeliac but the food is otherwise pretty good.
Lots of background noise when busy which might not suit those with hearing impairment."
3423,Good food and good access with a radar key shared with baby change toilet
3424,"There were several different areas of the event, all on ground level with no steps. There were only a few doors and they are all automatic. 
The event was very busy but all walkways were wide with plenty of room for wheelchairs and other mobility aids.
 
All restaurants and cafes had disabled access. The outdoor areas were all easily accessible. The only area that may have proved difficult for wheelchair and mobility aid users was the Supercar Paddock. It was located outside to the side of the main hall. The ground was uneven and pot-holed tarmac. 

The car and stunt show had 2 grandstand areas with plenty of accessible seating. The accessible seating areas had excellent views of the show. 
"
3425,"Parking to visit the tall ship is via the Riverside Museum. As a result, it is quite some distance from the vehicle through the museum and out onto the quayside where the tall ship is  moored. The same would apply if arriving by"
3426,"All on one level. No ramps, humps or bumps all on street level, Guide and assistance dogs welcome."
3427,"I only used the ground floor accessible toilet. The door is  labelled. However it consists of two rooms. The first has a baby changing table and you have to walk through this to get to the accessible toilet. The layout is not ideal. The accessible toilet itself was clean, with grab rails and emergency cord. "
3428,"There is a large, disabled accessible toilet with grab rails and alarm."
3429,"There is very limited on street parking nearby, but there is a NCP car park pretty much opposite. It's about a 15 minute walk from Princes Street and Holyrood Road has some local Lothian buses."
3430,"There is an 'easy access' toilet on the ground floor beside the skittle alley. It's good because it has a sliding door, but it's definitely on the small side. "
3431,You can easily access this cafe from the riverside car park or Eton station ordown the hill from the Windsor station.
3432,"See comments above. Most museums and churches are wheelchair accessible as are many shops, bars and restaurants."
3433,"From what I could see the access was good. The building was well signposted, and there was a ramp to the right of the door, in addition to the stairs. "
3434,Friendly and understood my needs
3435,Staff were polite.
3436,"This coffee shop has a ramp to the entrance and a Disabled access toilet. There is enough space for a wheelchair to turn around. Staff are very friendly and very happy to help. The sandwiches and snacks are freshly made to order and the home baking is "" to die for"".  I have been a few times now and it is well worth a visit."
3437,"Good effort with the toilets, could be a little cleaner."
3438,"The downstairs accessible loo was spacious,  had an adult sized changing loo and also had 2 different heights for coat hangers. I like the coat hanger feature as it shows they have made a real effort to think through the real needs of wheelchair users or those of short stature."
3439,"Superb friendly, english speaking staff who will go out of their way to help."
3440,Not entirely sure about parking as I arrived by taxi but there is a metro station right next door with trains every 15-20 mins depending on location. 
3441,We meandered over from Independence Square. You need to keep your eyes open for the best dropped kerbs but it is posslbe to get there without negotiating steps etc. There was also a sign at the front door saying that they had accessible parking.
3442,"Good wheelchair accessibility, good disabled toilet ( but a bit  small & cramped  with no grab rails in useful places) good helpful staff. Good visit, would recommend"
3443,"There's level access into the station, lower desk at the ticket booths, disabled loo and ramps taking you under the station to all platforms. Staff incredibly helpful and reliable."
3444,The local bus stops close by or you can get a taxi which will stop outside.
3445,"Can't comment on the parking, though there seemed to be a few spaces outside the churchyard. A number 20 bus from the city centre gets you quite close. The pavement by the nearest stop in High St is v narrow. Best to get off at Dunbar Street, walk back along St Machar's Drive and turn right along the Chanonry. Pavement narrow & a bit bumpy but manageable. From the Dunbar At bus stop to the Cathedral is about 7 minutes wheel/walk."
3446,"The accessible toilet is next to the disabled entrance and has ample room. Unfortunately, the corridor outside is very narrow and it’s almost impossible to queue for the toilet, particularly as the ladies toilet is opposite and people are also queueing for this. I was in the way of people the whole time. "
3447,"Accessible toilets in the function area, however I’m not sure what a person is to do if they are just having a meal or staying at the hotel how there meant to access the toilet when a function is actually on! Gate crash it 🤦🏻‍♂️"
3448,"Disabled access to get into the building was good, there was a friendly member of staff who met us at the start. There is a lift to every floor and signs for toilets and exhibitions. 
There is also small stools available throughout that you can take with you to sit down on. There are also a number of seats around the venue.  "
3449,"There were dropped kerbs but many were still only dropped to two inches. It was difficult to find disabled access shops. We stayed at the door and shouted to the shop keepers who happily came out and showed us their wares, very patient and helpful. We had similar problems with coffee and cake. Surprisingly McDonalds and Burger King were not accessible but full marks to Espresso Cafe. "
3450,"Street parking, no designated accessible parking.
Good drop off point, I got dropped off by taxi.
Public bus stance a 5 minute walk away"
3451,"Closest to disabled seating there were 2.  One of which was also a designated baby child change.  Queues for disabled far worse than for those with no disabilities...... instead you had people making comments about ""your not disabled "" "" you can't use this without a key"""
3452,Came straight up to us to say hello and tell us more about the sardines.
3453,"Plenty of space to park, and able to load , unload onto paved area. beyond that the 
Surroundings are gravel."
3454,"the staff at the station are really good when it comes to people with a disability, "
3455,Centrally located.
3456,Access is via lifts there are 2 that take you to the cinema foyer. 
3457,Really helpful and considerate
3458,"You will like the attentiveness of all staff members here, a warm welcome and support at reception, helpful cleaning ladies who take pride in their work, excellent waiting support in both restaurants, the head waiter is a pleasure."
3459,"The Staff were AMAZING and were really helpful, the accessible vehicle Driver was lovely and felt like my own personal driver though that was partly because it was super quiet and no one else needed his services, staff were all really helpful and knowledgeable."
3460,Parc Phoenix has its own tram stop which is also called Parc Phoenix. It's on tram line 2 and stops about a 3 - 5 minute walk from the entrance. There are also a number of buses which stop close by. Parc Phoenix is very near to Nice Airport.
3461,"Picture house is great for those with mobility issues and wheelchair users. Fot me, it's one of the most accessible cinemas in london, i can go and not stress about whether the film is showing in a room that has steps. Or whether the accessinle seating is right at the front.
The theatres ALL have level access and slopes to the seats rather than steps. The wheelchar seats are mostly loacted in the middle row so you get a great view (often youre forxed to sit at the front or back).
So it's good for thosexample of us who can walk but may struggle with steps but also wheelchair accessible.
There is a lift to all floors and the bar area.
The bar area is spacious with low tables and a variety of different seating.
The staff are really helpful.
There's disabled toilets. 
Parking is fairly good, it's near to venue but can get busy."
3462,"An attractive and extensive botanical garden and arboretum with wild meadow areas, an interesting museum and a really good place to eat, which is reviewed separately. If you love plants and birds and want a few hours away from the urban bustle, this is a great place to visit."
3463,Amazing access into St Paul's Cathedral and around when inside.
3464,Being in the centre of Glasgow there were plenty of buses to choose from. Taxis were in abundance and it was a short walk to both Glasgow Queen Street and Glasgow Central railway stations.
3465,This place is amazing! We have been three times before and are due to go again this month. The house is fabulous and well equipped. Lots of space and all hard floors downstairs. The access to the farm is easy as the ground is concrete and even. There is also a big pond which can be accessed down wide slopes. Cheryl and Roger are lovely and looked after us so well. There is a Sainsbury’s a short drive away. 
3466,Accessible large bathroom
3467,"The first negative regarding La Boheme Restaurant is the small step across the front of the restaurant. You could go around to the back of the restaurant for completely step-free access but it is a long way round. My Husband Rob is a full time wheelchair user and he can manage the step at the front with help from myself. We wouldn't usually spend our time at a venue where there is a step. However, La Boheme's other assets makes it one of our favourites.
The layout of La Boheme is excellent for wheelchairs with nice wide route-ways between tables. There is a variety of seating. However, there is a prominence of pedestal tables which can make it difficult for some wheelchair users to get close to the table."
3468,"The toilets are accessible, the entrance door is on a closure so is a little difficult to open. However on the several occasions I have visited ,the staff quickly came to my assistance."
3469,I was amazed at how they've managed to make such an old building so accessible. Very pleasantly surprised!
3470,The loos were fine.
3471,Very large coffee shop with plenty of different seating catering for all.
3472,No access for wheelchairs 
3473,"Kept locked - the key is available on the counter, attached to a purple whisk, so you can't miss it. There's an alarm cord and a grab rail beside the lavatory. Misses out on five stars only because there is no grab rail by the wash hand basin and the room is quite small so manoeuvering might present problems."
3474,"Menu is in medium sized letters, but available as a leaflet too. Small (2 inch) step to entrance but otherwise all on level. Toilet not accessible. I estimate that 2 out of 6 tables could be accessed by wheelchair (not checked this with a chair)"
3475,"There is parking at the venue though this costs £10, if you can, you can find on street parking."
3476,Wheelchair access to site easy but not for the tour which we couldn't access.... However the access statement on the website did alert us to that before we arrived so we knew what to expect.
3477,Spacious and clean.
3478,"Main entrance is flat, there is an automatic door amongst the main doors.

Once inside, there are three or four steps to where the cinema rooms are, there is a handrail at either side (but you could only hold one at a time, as they are far apart). However, to the left-hand side of the stairs, there is a long ramped corridor which can be used instead. This is ideal for wheelchair users!

Although it does have a sign, it's easy to not notice where the ramp is, initially. There is also a door to the ramp corridor, which is usually closed and has a buzzer system to get in. You press the button and a member of staff elsewhere in the cinema, releases the door so it can be opened, and so you can use the ramp.  Sometimes if they are busy, it can take a moment before staff can do this.

There is a hearing loop/support system in place.

The cinema recognises the CEA card, so with this a carer can get in for free.

In the cinema rooms, spaces for wheelchairs are at the back of the room. Probably room for 3 wheelchairs in each. There is only one carer seat immediately next to one of the wheelchair spaces, the other carer seats are in a row behind the wheelchair spaces. 
Depending on your needs, this may or may not be a difficulty. It does mean that you don't feel you are fully sharing the experience with the people you are with, as you can't sit next to each other.

3479,"The SSE Arena in Belfast is an entertainment venue, hosting a wide range of events such as concerts, comedy shows, sporting events and also a range of restaurants and bars. Disabled parking bays are available in the main car park closest to the building, accessible to blue badge holders. Entry into the building is at street level and lifts are available to provide access to all levels of the building. Vertical access through the building is provided principally by three 12-person lifts, one located in the North VIP entrance, one in the South VIP entrance and one in the main entrance lobby.
Staff are on hand at events to provide assistance if required. A limited number of wheelchairs are available to visitors on request.
There are 12 unisex, wheelchair accessible toilets throughout the Arena. The Arena Box Office has low level counter. Hearing enhancement systems. Six dedicated viewing areas are provided, providing access for visitors using wheelchairs and companions in the venue."
3480,"There are two entrances into Veritas. 
One of the entrances is a single, manual door that leads into a tight, right-angled corridor, followed shortly by another similar door. This entrance leads into a space where tables and chairs have just enough room to move between them and are all at a good height for wheelchair access, but because there are two steps leading from this area to the main area, the bar and toilets cannot be accessed without leaving the building and using the other entrance.
The other entrance is two double-doors very close together. The first set opens inwards and must close behind you before the second set, which open toward you, can be opened. This is a very tight space which not much room to manoeuvre a wheelchair. However, this leads into the area which is on the same level as the bar and toilets. Some of the tables are high but the majority are of a reasonable height for wheelchair access.
The bar itself is high with no lowered areas, which can make purchasing drinks tricky."
3481,Asked how to help.
3482,The toilet is near the entrance. I didn't see an alarm cord but I'm sure you'd have been heard if you ran into difficulties.
3483,The Wheelchair access lift in the New Look store in Milton Keynes centre was a very comfortable size for a wheelchair and an assistant carer. The lift functioned easily and elevated smoothly.
3484,Transport wise it was good. We were able to park right along side the entrance up toward the Abbey. There are other parking spots by the different entrances. It’s also a short walk from the town and the many buses plying their way around the town.
3485,We arrived by motorhome. The road in is quite narrow but not that busy so we had no problems. Nice wide entry into a huge car park. We'd booked electrics and they are all along the back edge of the car park. There are some blue badge spaces near to the entrance.
3486,"The ensuite bathroom was quite large. The toilet and shower both had grab rails and the shower had two different kinds of seats to choose from.

Like the bedroom, there was no emergency cord. The shelf and the mirror were too high to use, but there was a lower mirror in the bedroom."
3487,There is only one toilet per gender and if someone is in there with children you will wait for quite a while. This is a very popular restaurant so plan your bathroom visit well.
3488,Booked online using CEA card staff very helpful on arrival we booked seats at the back so had to be taken up in the lift to the box at the rear of the cinema it has plenty of room and had extra seat possibly if you need an extra carer
3489,Back in the day this plot of land featured the cricket green for the Royal Selangor Club. It was the place they first raised the Malayan flag in 1957 and it's now the place used for national parades and events of political/historical significance in Kuala Lumpur and has a giant flag pole (apparently one of the biggest in the world) to prove it! You can pick your way around most of the square without having to negotiate steps - but particularly at the flag end there are raised and lowered bits to navigate. 
3490,"There are steps at the entrance but they have an accessible notice on the door directing to a step-free alternative. Once inside there was good signage and very friendly staff. The tours are offered in various languages, and before starting you can explore the museum - it’s multi-sensory and all flat. We particularly enjoyed the pull out drawers which asked you to guess the smell.

One word of caution, it is a very dimly lit tour - a lot of this is to do with the port I believe, but also the visual displays they present (which are very impressive). There is lots of room however, and when it comes to the tasting there is a lift up to the balcony and the tables have pull out benches."
3491,We were spoiled as we had our own bus but there is limited parking available however be prepared for a walk!
3492,"Staff are very polite and helpful, especially those who work in the toilets."
3493,"Nice food, small soft play and lovely views. Accessible by car as it's a few miles outside of milngavie off the stockiemuir road. "
3494,The mnd scotland staff are fantastic and seem to make a big effort to make sure people who use the chalet have a good trip.
3495,"This shop is a real obstacle-course for wheelchair users, and on the day I visited it was a shambles, though I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff. "
3496,"Good level access into the venue. 
Can't access the upper level, but it's small and most of the action is downstairs anyway. 
Friendly, helpful staff."
3497,"The food and drinks were delicious, a great place to go if you are in the mood for some margaritas"
3498,Great Minature railway - really good fun for kids
3499,There is no parking in the park.
3500,"There is parking nearby in the Holyrood Park car park, and also at Duddingston Kirk. There was no nearby public transport."
3501,"Wide spaces but not, blue badge user friendly "
3502,"I had researched restaurants locally and liked the look of the layout of Zizzi.
I had rung to book and was told to use the online system.
I told them I used a mobility scooter and they again directed me online.
So I booked online.
Can you guess what happened when we arrived?
Once we managed to negotiate the double entrance doors ..  It's impossible for wheelchair or scooter users to push one, 
get through and then pull the other on their own.
We were met with a man
who demanded ""have you reserved?"".
""Yes, online.""
""You can't bring THAT (scooter) in here, there's no room""
""I can't leave it outside, and it folds when we're sat""
""You should have rung and arranged an accessible table""
""I did!  
And I was told to book online!""
""well there's no room to get through""
""do you talk to every disabled person like that?""
""we don't get many""

There you have it!

But we needed food, so we found a way and we enjoyed our meal.  But no tip was left!"
3503,"The time we visited there were three marked places which appear not to be used for disabled parking, one had a trailer parked in it and another was blocked by a car parked randomly. However, there is a coned and marked area as well with approx. 5 parking spaces so there was ample places to park.
Unfortunately ourselves and another party who used the disabled parking spaces (lady with a walking stick) were all gestured away from the access door next to the parking and told to go to the front of the building to gain access. This would have been just about ok for a wheelchair (depending on the wheel type/size) but was a nightmare for the rollator due to the size and layout of the cobbles.  The lady with the walking stick looked to be struggling too. Then at the front the difference in heights and gaps in the cobbles was difficult to negotiate.
Thankfully when we got inside the attitude of the security team was excellent.
"
3504,"The Sherlock Holmes Museum is at 221b Baker Street, located in a Georgian town house dating from 1815. It is more like visiting Sherlock's home rather than a traditional museum, although there are objects and paraphernalia from the stories."
3505,The hotel is situated in a fantastic scenic location and the staff try to accommodated wheelchair users by offering them a deluxe room loch side. Our room had a bath which was not accessable but as we were there for only 1 night it was not a great issue. We also had a sauna in the room which again wasn't accessable. We had a small veranda onto the loch but didn't give it a go in February. Have stayed before at this hotel and loved the food but on this visit thought it was very poor and bland. The wheelchair access toilet is part of the ladies facilities and is so small you can't get the door closed with a wheelchair in the toilet. It is not a disabled toilet and they should be ashamed to claim it is.
3506,"Level access entry with automatic doors on entrance. Lifts to access all floors. The through floor lift also has an electric door. Hearing loop is available. Supposedly for safety on two wheelchair users allowed on upper floors for evacuation reasons. Some of the labels on the walls were not easy to read as was small print and on a white background, not sure if any large print available as I used my phone to zoom in. Seating available. Some areas could only be accessed via manual fire doors. The mummy section was not accessible to wheelchairs as there was a step. One area had drawers to open which were low down and not easy to open as there was no lip on handle to grip."
3507,Limited spaces
3508,"Have only ever travelled by car to Braehead. There are large (free) car parks, though these can still get quite busy, particularly at weekends.

There are many marked disabled bays, and their own security/parking team do inspect that these are used by blue-badge holders only.

There are buses to Braehead, but getting there by public transport could take a bit of planning. No trains go there. "
3509,"The cottages are especially designed for disabled people, with roll-in showers, grab-rails, low-level surfaces in the kitchen and wide doorways amongst other things, plus you can hire other equipment you may need, such as hoists, but it’s all perfectly comfortable for the able-bodied too. A lot of thought has gone into the design and the whole place is very attractive. All the cottages have some outside space – patio or garden and they sleep from 3 people in the smallest to 10 in the largest; a couple of them are two-storey with a lift. "
3510,"Excellent access from the Balgreen end. No intermediate access points for wheelchair users. Sound access at the Corstorphine end, though whoever developed the Paddockholm estate on the site of Corstorphine Station hadn't heard of drop-downs."
3511,"The staff were very rude and didn't want us on the site, only allowed us on the sight for 1 night but we had to share our friends pitch who had a campervan."
3512,"Since I walked to the Dry Dock, I am not of provisions for disabled parking. However, since the pub is right opposite Leeds Beckett University in the City Centre, there are plenty of bus options that are available. "
3513,"I'm deeply impressed with this pub. It's spacious, fully wheelchair accessible, and the food is delicious. Staff are lovely, and there's a mainly excellent accessible toilet. Strongly recommended!

"
3514,"Helpful, friendly, and jovial. Made the visit.a.pleasure."
3515,"As I mentioned, the only staff we saw were in the cafe. They were helpful and wore masks. "
3516,"There are no step-free stations nearby. At Angel tube station you can get from street to platform using only escalators, which is a bonus (no fixed steps at all). Many bus routes pass Islington Green, amongst others the 43, 73, 19, and 38."
3517,"We noticed a lot of broken kerbs that could be difficult for someone using a chair.  There were a lot of areas along the street with potholes and uneven surfaces.  It was noted that someone with visual impairment could be quite unsafe.  The pavements were all lowered though so that was good! Good easy access to the main entrance. 
"
3518,The cafe is up on the old platform in the old waiting room. It’s a steep ramp to get up on to the platform. The entry to the cafe is step free at the front but has a step down to exit at the back. You can also get to the seating areas by coming back out the front and round the side. There is a marquee at platform level with seating in or down the ramp there is a level floor hexagonal covered seating area or a wooden area but this has a step. 
3519,"From the entrance, staff are recognising of any potential assistance that may be required and point out the inclusion and access facilities that are available. They also form that their staff and guides are aware of being able to offer additional assistance. Could not be more attentive."
3520,"Several (about 12, I think) disabled car park spaces."
3521,"Toilet within wet room. 2 handrails for toilet,  right transfer. Rails by sink, within shower and at door. Fold down seat within shower area."
3522,"There was a low step to access the restaurant. I am a manual wheelchair user and needed a slight shove from my husband to negotiate the step, but once I was in there was level access to the main part of the restaurant. There was no access to the toilets for a wheelchair user."
3523,The whole place is exceptionally well laid out . Plenty of space to use myscooter including in the cafeand restaurant .
3524,"Zest Cafe is a social enterprise that focuses on supporting those with barriers to employment by giving them employment opportunities. I spent a fews months at Zest on placement learning about marketing and social media. The staff are very welcoming and friendly and, whilst I am not a coffee drinker, I can appreciate how hard the staff work to ensure that the coffee they serve is of the highest quality. The staff are extremely passionate and knowledgable about what they do and and that is really lovely to see. As a wheelchair user, the venue was easy to access and disabled toilet is spacious to."
3525,Great loo but its at the back of the shop so quite tricky to get to
3526,lacked disability awareness
3527,"We drove to the venue, I doubt if there is any public transport. There is a gravel car park opposite. This has a short steep ramp to the entrance and as I am in a wheelchair my husband had to take me down backwards. You can stop just outside the pub to drop off or pick up instead."
3528,Friendly and helpful.
3529,"This venue is totally wheelchair freindly, their is no were un-accessible for people with a disability"
3530,"Pleasantly surprised that the most disabled friendly facility in our trip to Aviemore turned out to be 3,500ft up the Cairngorm! The funicular is thoroughly recommended for able bodied and wheel chair users as a great day out.   Fantastic exhibition, great cafes, stunning views, and highly accessible facility."
3531,Out of order sign on door but it had been used for storage. They quickly cleared it so I could use it. Disabled  toilet quite shabby compared to rest of the restaurant. 
3532,Very easy
3533,Toilets are located in the St. Enoch Shopping center. The all clean with plenty of space for career. The toilets also lock and unlock without much effort. Clean and well stocked with toilet roll.
3534,Due to the fact it's in the city centre parking can be an issue. However blue badge users can park on George Street if there are any spaces available. Also there are plenty of bus and tram stop close by. There is also plenty of taxis ranks in the vicinity.
3535,Clean. Accessible.
3536,"Disabled access was excellent. They have wheelchair accessible ramps to the main entrance and the main entrance also has automatic doors. The galleries themselves, the shop and cafe are all on one level. "
3537,"Friendly staff, offering to take over products for those in need, not condescending"
3538,"The road which the King's Fund is located has quite narrow pavements. There are automatic entrance doors. On arrival there is a reception desk and the Book Club met in the library, which is on the ground floor and is step free. There was a good choice of free standing, firm but comfortable chairs and a sofa, all with arms."
3539,"Exellent, we were shown round  by our own personal guide which made it more interesting. This appeared to be the norm, there were lots of volunteers helping everyone."
3540,"If you're of the belief that nuclear weapons have no place in the modern world you could do worse than to pop into the peace camp at Faslane naval base, outside Helensburgh. There are always friendly welcoming folk ready to offer you their hospitality. With a nice wide colourful gate beside the 'visitors welcome' sign, a slabbed path twists a little bumpily through a tangle of trees and caravans into the heart of the peace camp where they are building a new, larger communal building and along to where they are converting a caravan to be wheelchair accessible, should a wheelchair-using peace activist wish to stay for a bit."
3541,The hotel gives you free parking in the hotel opposite for stays of 7 nights or more.  Tour companies provide transfers from the airport. Plenty of buses and taxis in Benidorm 
3542,"Small mainly gravel car park....no specific disabled parking.
No nearby bus stops that I am aware of."
3543,This is covered in the introduction.
3544,"What a treat !!! My family and I went to the Goring Hotel for afternoon tea just before Christmas . Luxury at its best. It was delicious. There is wheelchair access, a disabled toilet  and the staff were more than helpful . "
3545,The staff are excellent. Have always talked to my daughter and not just me. The pantomime cast love having groups of disabled youngsters in and are very inclusive. Shows for specific guests are highlighted and the staff are very good at communicating. Box office staff are equally helpful when booking.
3546,"The restaurant car park is directly next to the ramped, level access.  Good bus service"
3547,"Disabled access is at the back. You access this from the main shopping area, pedestrian walk way which is all completely flat."
3548,"We went by tram and got off at Guggenheim Sagrado Corazon. Trams are frequent, easy to use, and have level boarding access."
3549,"Flat, large, clean, easy access."
3550,"The loo in our bathroom had good rails and was easy for me to use. Nice and clean, as you'd hope for a hotel bathroom."
3551,Generally level open access over looking the Bradford water. Nice and roomy.
3552,Once you are in the access everywhere else is good.
3553,"Generally accessible. Staff training needed in the placement of stock - without this, the score would be higher


"
3554,The museum is a little out of the centre of town - we got a cab. There are different types of taxis some of which are more spacious than others!
3555,There was plenty of parking spaces. 
3556,Excellent!! Not much more to add other than every single member of staff couldn't do enough to help!!
3557,"Level access. The doors were held open when I visited but they do also have push buttons to open the double doors. 
Clear central walkway. Mix of built in and movable chairs. I went up and ordered at the counter where you can see the sweet options. They also had a QR code for accessing the menu on your phone while you are at the table. "
3558,This museum celebrates the history of Oxford that isn't University history. It isn't big but they have made good use of the space. The Town Hall has an accessible entrance and any wheelchair users have to go that way. My kids love the interactive display as you go in. The museum is accessed via a platform lift if you can't use the stairs. They often do an activity pack for smaller children. Check the website. There's an accessible cafe in the Town Hall.
3559,"Meadowhall is a large shopping centre with a food court, restaurants and a cinema. There is level access throughout the building which is divided between two floors, with several lifts."
3560,"Liverpool Central Station 5 mins walk away, Taxis/Buses 2-3 mins away"
3561,"Staff are usually helpful if a little slow to recognise when & what is needed, and are friendly if at times blunt."
3562,I arrived by bus. The 27 bus stops nearby on Granville Terrace. There is also ample on street parking in the surrounding streets. 
3563,Stopped for lunch and also able to buy some gifts too. Came in the summer and was able to eat outside too. Will come again.
3564,Lift to take you up to levels 2 & 3. Wheelchairs  can't go up to the top level as there are steps
3565,"I love browsing and shopping in Robert Dyas and this branch in East Sheen is reasonably easy to get around for wheelchair users, except at the tills. "
3566,Plenty of space and very clean. Accessible door.
3567,"Level access. Door is electric and automatic.

No designated accessible till. 

Lights are bright, no music. Shelves aren't too high. "
3568,"As stated above, disabled transport and access have extremely low priority. You feel like an imposition, at best."
3569,"Entry is through a large open double door, there are two lifts and stairs. The lifts are very narrow, a very wide wheelchair may not fit through. My electric wheelchair is long but not wide so I *just* fit in. I got the lift up to level 2 to check in, the desk is very high and it would have been hard to reach had I been in my manual wheelchair but it was ok and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I got the lift to the 7th floor to my room and it was easy to get to. The bedroom itself had great ease of access, space to turn, space next to the bed for the wheelchair. It was very easy to get around in. "
3570,"At the front of the restaurant is the accessible toilet, which is spacious, clean, well laid-out, and the red emergency cord reaches all the way to the floor and hadn't been tampered with."
3571,Staff were attentive and friendly.
3572,"It's situated on the high street, which has a couple of disabled parking bays, one of which is very close to the front door. It can get quite busy at times, so parking close can occasionally be difficult. There is a large car park with more disabled bays a short walk from the cafe, but it's down a hill that some users may find challenging."
3573,"Flat access, automatic doors, ramps and lifts"
3574,"Can get tours and see the book of Kells, also has changing places bathroom in the arts block off Nassau St."
3575,Would be a four if it wasn't for the step at the front door.
3576,"Although there is no dedicated parking, there is nearby parking - free for Blue Badges. Street parking is also nearby. "
3577,"The main entrance  is accessible from street level with no steps and automatic doors, there is a sign with what is on every floor. The reception is low and accessible to a wheelchair user and has a hearing loop. There is lift access to every floor and accessible toilets on every floor. The theatre has wheelchair accessible seating areas and also offers performances that have British Sign Language interpretation. The cinema also has wheelchair   accessible seating and has audio description and subtitled screenings. "
3578,The accessible loo is adjacent to the cafe but you do need to wheel over some very uneven stone tiles to reach the toilet door. The door was not easy to open or close (dragged on the floor) and therefore I required help. The toilet itself was large and clean (see photo).
3579,"One of the main squares in Puerto de la Cruz, with garden, benches to sit, childrens play area. Square is surrounded by restaurants and bars"
3580,An accessible restaurant with good circulation space with room for groups of chair users to meet. 
3581,The staff were very helpful and friendly. Although it wasn't table service the staff who brought out the food and took orders for desserts were very friendly. 
3582,Staff were brilliant and really helpful. They always brought my tray to the table. Service generally was also excellent.
3583,Access to all of the screen involves negotiating stairs.
3584,Specially Allocated spaces right outside the main entrance to the hotel.
3585,This is an open area of parkland but there were sufficient good paths to enable the scooter to get around a large proportion of the site
3586,Easy access and good parking facilities
3587,Not really accessible as the main attraction is out of bounds.
3588,"The staff were lovely, very professional.  I took half a mark off as there was no personality about them."
3589,"It would have been a 5, but the toilets are not wheelchair accessible. The food is just the best Thai we have ever eaten! So even though the toilet is not accessible we just keep coming back!"
3590,"This is accommodation built specifically for special needs, and after 3 visits we can't find anything that has been missed. Look at the website for photos."
3591,The theatre is in a village which a 10 minute taxi ride from Reading Station. Reading Station has step free access and the taxi rank is immediately outside of the station. The taxi was able to drop off/ pick up directly outside the theatre.  Taxi from Reading Station cost about £12 - 14 (2017).  There is no local bus service. There is a car park.
3592,"Generally great, but be prepared to have to double back on occasion! We crossed the bow bride and ended up in the area that's called the ramble, this was completely a no go, full of steps etc, we doubled back and stuck mainly to the main thoroughfare which was grand. We popped off at certain bits to explore."
3593,Can't praise the museum enough as there were loads of good accessible loos throughout the building. We were visiting as part of Disabled Access Day and it was fantastic to wheel around the corner when we arrived to discovered a mobile Changing Places toilet! A great idea and much appreciated by some of the other visitors we met.
3594,"The staff were very helpful and chatted with my daughter, which was nice. We only intended going in for a hot chocolate while we waited for the store next door to open, but ended up having lunch too as we felt so welcome."
3595,"Fully step free access (smooth flooring) with lifts to all floors.  Very easy to self-propel around, and view all the exhibits in a wheelchair"
3596,The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a lift. The rooms were spacious and the corridors were quite wide. There is also a seating area in reception.
3597,"The majority of the museum has plenty of wide walkways and areas which are easy to negotiate with a wheelchair. There are lifts to all floors although, on this visit, a number of facilities were 'out of order' i.e. one lift, a lot of the information video boards and the hand-dryer in the ladies! The planes themselves were, on the whole, easy to see with their information boards at a good level for wheelchairs."
3598,One accessible loo with good turning and transferring space. Drop down rails available along with a red cord card. 
3599,The staff were fantastic and friendly. 
3600,"Blue Badge parking immediately outside the front door. Accessible buses, from Lothian Buses, come into the Craigleith Retail Park."
3601,"Although I haven't required any assistance for access needs, whenever I have talked to staff or made any other enquiries they have been approachable and helpful. "
3602,"Parking was reasonable, multi-storey with disabled bays nearby. We parked on nearby double yellow lines using Blue Badge"
3603,"The staff at this hotel are very nice and helpful, and there is a very well-equipped disabled toilet.  However, to get there from the lobby you have to manage 2 narrow doors, neither of which are automatic.  It is manageable, but not easy!"
3604,I was very impressed by every staff member that we met. We had a few questions about the area etc and they couldn't have been more helpful. Fantastic!
3605,Excellent access for wheelchairs.
3606,At least there was one.
3607,"Access for all disabled people, no ramps needed as flat access. Disabled toilets available and very friendly staff."
3608,The guide who helped me was Martin a lovely man who had experience with  his mother-in-law who had been a wheelchair user when she was alive. Room guides were knowledgeable and friendly.
3609,"A top 5 star small hotel, situated in the wonderful quaint chocolate box village of Wroxton, (5*) with many thatched roofs, as is the hotel itself, so do not miss this village, and see all the photos we provide for you. The grounds are very pleasantly laid out with a variety of plants, as it leads you to the foyer for the hotel. We did not see any disabled parking bays, so had to drive to car park area to the right and behind hotel.
(See notes on parking). Either in advance, or asking friend to inquire at reception, a ramp can be provided and set up by staff member to allow you to enter the hotel, and what a delight that is, lovely deco, nice seating areas, beautifully laid out, and comfortable, so please do give the hotel a visit when you can. However, there’s always a however, without the help of the provided ramp, this is not a friendly hotel as to many steps involved in getting you around, but if you can manage with the ramp support, or you can manage a few steps, it is well worth the effort to visit. ( Do look at all the photos provided for you to help you make up your mind about visiting the hotel ). There is a nice little bar area with nice seating, and this leads you to the lovely restaurant, beautifully laid out and inviting, and the food itself is very good, and presented nicely for you. The drinks menu is good, a little expensive, but so what ! See our notes about the disabled room itself, and read all the bits and pieces to get the feel about what we feel about this delightful hotel. And whatever you do, make sure you drive through Wroxton village itself after your visit, it truly is a chocolate box village of the highest order.  Just turn left from hotel exit onto main road for just a few feet, and turn right on the sharp bend, be careful, it’s a main road,  then drive past duck pond and make sure you stop here to see all the lovely thatched cottages, before moving on through the rest of the village on your way to your next place of visit.  Enjoy."
3610,For once a football ground with a good view of the pitch for wheelchair supporters and staff who went out of their way to arrange car parking and resolve on the day issues.
3611,Park and Ride site so regular low floor buses from various stops around York. Lots of disabled parking spaces. If you follow the signs for mobility then there is a mini car park just for blue badge holders. Flat access from car park to entrance.
3612,Spontaneously decided to visit for Evensong as part of their Disabled Access Day programme. So pleased we did! Staff were fantastic. Set up was amazing. Very cool circular lift that whisks you into the main part of the Cathedral. Evensong itself pretty amazing - great to see the pomp and ceremony of such an historical building up close!
3613,"Accessible in all areas, good lifts, good toilets (with one gripe), friendly staff. One star lost overall for ramshackle not-fit-for-purpose borrowable wheelchairs, and for an out-of-reach red emergency cord in the accessible toilet (see below)."
3614,"This is a review of the Stanley Kubrick exhibition which is on until 15 September 2019. On this visit I only visited the Kubrick exhibition but there is lots to see on other floors which are accessible by lift. 

The Design Museum relocated to its current building in 2016. It's housed in the re-furbished Commonwealth Institute building, which I'm old enough to remember, and the museum has excellent access.

My overall visit was extremely positive, as generally access was easy and the exhibition was amazing. However I did speak to staff about access and that is why this review is quite detailed about the small things that could be improved on."
3615,"Plenty of accessible spaces at the top and bottom ends of the car park, however Wagamamas is in the middle and there are no spaces directly outside."
3616,"The building has great access, the bar area is wide and was playing Belle and Sebastian, which is always a good thing! I didn't go upstairs, but there is a lift.  "
3617,"engaged and helpful, let me say what help I needed and were happy to comply."
3618,Very helpful and friendly. Nothing too much trouble
3619,"Nice wide doors, step free entry, large accessible toilet. We went at lunchtime and had a large sandwich on freshly made bread and a freshly made pizza with a soft drink thrown in for a fiver each. They serve alcoholic drinks and are open in the evening too. Had a nice courtyard outside for the summer, but I couldn't see how you would get to it in a wheelchair (and forgot to ask!)."
3620,There are barriers to get through but there is usually a member of staff at the wider gate which is usually open.  Some platforms are level access.   Others have a steep ramp or lift.  The lift is quite far from the platform and at one side there is a step.  the lift is 16 person but quite small.  There are tactile paving close to the edge of the platform.  There are help buttons at each platform.  
3621,There is a designated car park located next to the treehouse which is signposted disabled parking drop off which can also be used for people who hold a blue badge. Alternatively their is also blue badge parking in the main Alnwick garden car park which is situated on the same site as the treehouse restaurant and only a short five minute walk away from the treehouse entrance. 
3622,"Pointless due to actual positioning 

Staff training would be helpfull as not all disabilities are the same

Use or bright lights and sound also not helpful for those with autism"
3623,Staff are happy to help and do not pressure you to buy.
3624,"There are excellent public transport links. Dalston Kingsland is the nearest station but it is not step free. However, Dalston Junction is step free and is about a 5 minute walk away. Both stations are part of London Overground. There are also a number of buses that stop just outside or very close by."
3625,We travelled by car and our Satnav took us straight there.
3626,"The staff were amazing, we asked if they could tell us how to get to 'fort charlotte' and they told us the most accessible way to get to fort charlotte."
3627,"I gave them one star for actually having a disabled toilet, however I didn't really fancy going in it as it was covered in used toilet roll and paper towels."
3628,"Majority of staff are friendly, although, there is the odd one that will try and place people in a wheelchair out of view and has a condescending look on her face to people with walking aids."
3629,Very helpful at counter two working in a very busy shop
3630,"Can park right outside, completely flat access from car to the door of the cottage"
3631,Large pub able accommodate wheelchairs etc. Great and very understanding with those who have learning disabilities or dementia
3632,"This beautiful, historic church has good access facilities and welcoming, helpful volunteer staff. It is also where Agatha Christie was married. "
3633,I visited Toby carvery Liberton for a meal with my husband and friend. We had used this restaurant many times before the pandemic. The entrance to the restaurant has double doors which can be opened wide enough for wheelchair access. The restaurant is all on one level. When we book we request a table with easy access for my wheelchair and near the carvery so I can see what foods they have that day. The staff are very helpful and if the aren’t too busy will help my husband carry my plate to our table as he gets both meals at the same time. I was most surprised on this visit that the manger was still remembered us as we hadn’t been able to visit since Dec 2019 due to the pandemic and my medical condition. She greeted us got us settled at the table and asked how I was. And did I want my usual drink of orange and lemonade no ice. It was lovely to be greeted in such a friendly way. The staff were great and couldn’t do enough to help us. We will certainly be going back again.
3634,"Accessible toilets can be found on all floors. They are clean, spacious, and provide excellent grab rails. I am not aware if any have full changing facilities or not."
3635,This was the first time I'd booked ahead to rent a scooter on holiday. and it went so well I'm eager to do it again. Accessible Madrid were helpful over email before I went and responsive when I needed to call them about something when I was in the city. I thought their charges were reasonable and the delivery and pickup of the scooter at our hotel went well.
3636,One of the best retail areas I have ever visited and very disabled friendly
3637,Not sure about parking - but the High Line is easy to access from a multitude of locations. Many of the New York Subway stations are wheelchair accessible - including 14th St 8th Ave which is just a couple of blocks away from the Gansevoort elevator.
3638,Eating outside was very straightforward. Inside there was level access. A one way system was in use which might be narrow in parts for wheelchair or powerchair users (see rope in the photos below). 
3639,Staff always seem helpful and happy to help
3640,"We attempted to visit House of Dun today , one of our party in a powered wheelchair. We were not expecting to be able to get into the house. We did hope to get into the garden, which the online guide says is wheelchair friendly. It may possibly be. But the access to the garden is over large  loose stone chippings, so we couldn't get through the gateway to find out.   Rollator also couldn't cope.
Blue badge parking was by the entrance. Cafe and shop and courtyard were accessible. Outer  edge of courtyard has flagstoned path. However, this is partly obscured by tied open barn doors,  and as we negotiated around the doors we we got the wheelchair stuck in the loose chippings. 

Disappointed, but at least we hadn't travelled far from our holiday accommodation.

"
3641,"Access in and around the building:

The steps and door to the building were fairly easy to find as I was with a companion. At the door we were greeted by a member of staff and shown the reception which was helpful.

Once inside the building we were shown around. Getting to the rooms required the use of the lift or stairs. Interestingly, and helpfully, the corridors by the lift were painted bright green, in other places different colours – this all aided navigation.

I loved the large door numbers and even more so the lighting above the door which made them easier to find. As well as helping with locating the door lock. The bold pink stripe to the side of the door was also a great feature.

Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:

Once in the accessible room them was plenty of space. Good use of colour contrast and lighting.

Access in the dining area:

The bold use of colour and good lighting made the dining area a great environment. 

Access to other facilities:

The bar was bright and light with a choice of seating."
3642,"We visited with a group of young people all with additional needs. Accessibility is fantastic, and our tour guide was excellent. Thank you for this opportunity."
3643,"I have never been here before, so thought we would give it a go because it was recommended. I am in a wheelchair so did not know what to expect and when we got to the front door of the restaurant it was clear there was going to be a problem getting in due to a large step. However, one of the staff saw me and very quickly came out and told me that there was alternative access at the back of the restaurant as they had two entrances. The staff went out of their way to ensure we could get in and three of them all were very attentive and ensured i had a suitable table that i could sit under in my wheelchair and fussed over me quite a bit which made me feel very appreciated. Throughout the night the service was first rate as was the food with an excellent menu and choice of foods. I felt very comfortable there and would definitely go back.

I did not use the toilets so cannot comment on these for wheelchair users. 

Overall an excellent place to go."
3644,"Difficult to score because surfaces vary. Our advice is try it and different points and make up your mind. Good surfaces at southern end near Ashbourne and Tissington, but some rough bits near Hartington which were ok on a power chair but a little uncomfortable on a small scooter."
3645,"Rozelle Estate covers an area of 37 hectares in South Ayrshire, which has beautiful plants and interesting wildlife such as birds, swans, ducks and squirrels etc.

The estate opened to the public in 1968 for cultural and leisure use to access the grounds of the Rozelle Estate to enjoy walks around the stunning woodland, rhododendron walks, parkland and ornamental ponds.

Inside the estate there is two galleries one of which is Rozelle House Galleries which is the permanent home to a collection of 54 paintings based on poem Tam O’ Shanter written by Robert Burns Scotland’s most famous poet.

Rozelle House is also the home to the Ayrshire Yeomanry Museum. The other gallery has a collection of traditional and modern works by commissioned artists and works purchased by the Maclaurin Trust who are the benefactors of the gallery. Throughout the estate there are a series of sculptures by the world famous sculptor Henry Moore.
"
3646,Toilets very acccessible   Only down side is that the sink being slightly too close to toilets can make transferring tricky.
3647,Friendly and knowledgeable 
3648,Staff were very friendly and helpful. There is an information desk in the main part of the station where assistance can be found easily. There is also a member of staff on every platform to help with wheelchair transfers to the train and are very helpful with questions.
3649,"The main entrance, at the corner of the pub, is step-free and most wheelchairs and powerchairs will fit through just one of the double doors at that entrance. The whole pub is gigantic and very spacious for manoeuvring."
3650,"We drove there and found quite a few disabled spaces dotted around the town centre; we parked opposite the police station and meandered through Poitiers which was about a ten minute wander from there to the church.  Meandering is highly recommended as there are lots of architectural treasures, museums and shops throughout Poitiers.
There is a train station but it was at the foot of the city and it would be a steep uphill climb and although there are buses, I'm not sure if they were accessible. "
3651,"Very good automatic doors ,lifts wide isles only a small lift to top floor disabled trollies to attach to your wheelchair"
3652,The willingness of staff to help and the thought given to signposting and general access was excellent. Things like large print guides to the exhibition room content were very good - useful to wheelchair users who may have difficulty reading exhibit labels as well as those with sight impairments.
3653,"The disabled toilet is a bit strange - you go through a lobby to it. I waited outside for quite a while before realising the door led to the lobby and not the main toilet! Bar staff have a radar key for it. Inside it's a little bit small, but nicely done and very clean."
3654,"There is an accessible toilet, which requires a radar key to use, at the top of the pier. Alongside male and female toilets.
At time of writing, these were all closed due to coronavirus procedures. 

The cafe at Kids on Park has a toilet located on the outside of its premises, which anyone can use for a charge of 30p.
I don't believe this to be an accessible toilet, but was unable to check as this was also closed at time of writing. 
"
3655,"This was a real home away from home. All the equipment we have at home was there as arranged which made things very easy. The wet room was brilliant. The weather was great and we made good use of the garden and conservatory.
The owners popped round on the first day to check we had everything we wanted and answered any questions we had which was a nice touch.
Good location.
Would definitely stay again"
3656,"To the left of the Burger King there is a door with a pushpad on the left of the door. Pressing this takes you to the outside of two wheelchair accessible toilets! Both hand handrails on both sides, red cords hanging low and sinks that you can roll under. I used this with my powerchair and you could fit someone else in although this may be a squeeze in larger wheelchairs. Upon leaving the toilet the outer door opens automatically which is brilliant!"
3657,"Can't comment on the parking. Buses along Unter den Linden (100 or 200) will get you quite close, but tend to be crowded. The nearest bus stop is Lustgarten, about five minutes level wheel/walk. The nearest S-bahn station (accessible) is Hackescher Markt, which is about 10 minutes wheel/walk away, a route with quite a lot of cobbles & tramlines to cross and a steepish push up to the crown of the bridge over the Spree. The ticket office is (as of 2016) not in the museum but in the courtyard between the museum and the Alte Nationalgalerie."
3658,Stalls set considering its the first time is well laid out hope it will be a successful day.
3659,"A flawless experience from start to finish. Seated at the front, right in front of the stage made me feel at the heart of the performance. Before reaching this position, I was guided through undercover pathways, protecting me from the rain, to grab a cuppa before heading into the tent.

There are generously roomy toilets to the right of the entrance, both a disabled toilet and a fully equipped changing places toilet.

Staff are incredibly helpful and go above and beyond to make your experience as easy and as delightful as possible.

I love a bookshop and the one on site does not disappoint. There is so much space to move around , I spent an incredibly long time browsing!"
3660,"Can get it and out just fine, might struggle to navigate the doors with a big wheelchair but I'm sure they'd help you out!"
3661,Access is generally excellent. The only thing that is a little tricky is its quite tight to get past the pillar to get to the toilets.
3662,"All friendly and welcoming. Slightly let down by one volunteer, though, when I asked her if there were any more ramps that could be put out and she was flummoxed, saying she'd never come across a query like that and maybe I should just accept that this was an old place where you couldn't expect such things. Actually, it's not an old place; it's a new town made of rebuilt old buildings, and it would be perfectly feasible to put in a few dropped kerbs in keeping with the style of the site, or get more than one wooden ramp out. Blists Hill is already a lovely place - a tweak or two like this would make it even better."
3663,"There was a disabled Portaloo there but i never used it,i had a  look inside and it didn't look that good to be honest,no grab rails or raised seat so i would have struggled but others may have managed.Not very big and enough room for my carer and i."
3664,Council car parks with blue badge spaces - one  across road and one about 200 yards away.  Can be dropped off near door.  Bus stops nearby.
3665,"The Guinness storehouse is undoubtedly a great day out for tourists and Irish natives alike. The storehouse itself is easily accessible with lifts, ramps and plenty of room to move around. The tour itself is very interesting, taking you through the history of the drink itself and the process of how it's made. The highlight of the tour definitely has to be the gravity bar where you can pour your own pint of Guinness and enjoy it while looking out over all of Dublin. There is even a tap which has been specially adapted for wheelchair users. Mobility wheelchairs are available for use from the information desk free of charge. "
3666,"Didn't make for the most comfortable coffee visit, having to correct the order twice and staff who didn't seem entirely enthused. More important matters though, the disabled access could definitely be worked on as I'll explain below."
3667,I never used the toilet but they were well signposted.
3668,Blue badge spaces at the end of the ramp leading to the front entrance.
3669,This shopping centre is on Princess St and is made up of a number of units over 3 floors. The lower ground this is the food court area and has a good selection of outlets to suit a range of tastes. The 1st floor and ground floor are all non food stores.
3670,"Full wheelchair access. Steps present in building but lift to all floors available. Small restaurants/dining area as you immediately enter building. Automatic door at street entry, second push/pull door once inside."
3671,"It is a   bit of a walk to the front entrance and there are heavy doors to the inside.  Once inside and seated, there is little room to move around but there is no need to as all is catered for.  Signs are in Chinese & English."
3672,Bang in the middle of ground floor  with room for the whole family
3673,Although not expecting to meet anyone from the market we did meet a gentleman who helped us with the accessible toilet. The folk in the many shops were friendly and welcoming.
3674,"Great spot if you are arriving on public transport. If you are coming by bus, as I did, there are stops within a few metres for most directions. It's also directly opposite the Waverley Steps entrance to the railway station."
3675,"Parking for blue badge holders is free and plentiful in the Hayward Gallery car park, adjacent to Festival Hall. No need to register or take your ticket to the box office....just display your blue badge. There are also four disabled spaces on Belvedere Road immediately outside Southbank Centre, with no time limit."
3676,"Helpful, friendly & efficient. We arrived three hours before check-in time but found that our room was ready and we were given access straight away."
3677,Plenty of Disabled Parking if needed near the venue. Nextbike Hire Bike Docking Station at the centre with plenty of space for personal bikes also. 
3678,"This was my first visit to the Dakota hotel in Glasgow. I had visited their hotel at euro central, it's just off the M8 motorway on the way to Motherwell, so I knew what standard to expect and I wasn't disappointed.
Their buildings look like something from Gotham city in a Batman movie. Inside the hotel the lighting is quite low so may cause problems for people with visual impairments, I think this is to create a Gothic feel to the place."
3679,"Right outside a bus stop, next to thimblerow car park, disabled parking spots right outside! Fab!"
3680,"There are a number if disabled toilets. The toilets nearest to the carpark (M and F) are large and have excellent hand dryer in good position. However, the disabled toilet door in the restaurant could not be accessed without assistance. All were clean."
3681,"Staff were brilliant, so apologetic about lift, and as mentioned the manageress gave me a years pass as compensation. 
All staff were very friendly, approachable and helpful from the minute we arrived, and nothing was too much trouble for them "
3682,Smooth ramp going into the bar with large double doors.
3683,"Staff are trained to be extremely helpful, and they talk ""to"" you which is always preferable."
3684,Always friendly and willing to help
3685,"We were apprehensive going to a concert with our two sons who are wheelchair users. So many things could present as an issue but we had a fantastic experience. Friendly staff, plenty of accessible toilets, easy access, good seating (with no one blocking your view or standing in front of the wheelchair). Plenty of parking around the Arena."
3686,It was generally clean enough with everything in. Flush slightly difficult and water had a tendency to come out strong and fast from the tap!
3687,There is plenty of accessible parking which is patrolled so there is generally spaces available.
3688,I had a fantastic night at the Macklemore concert at O2 Academy in Glasgow.  This was the first time I'd been here and I had heard mixed reviews about its wheelchair accessibility but it was great from the minute I made myself known to security to the minute they helped me to leave; I couldn't have felt more welcome.  The highlight was feeling safe while still in the middle of the action and not being split up from my friends and family!  The staff were lovely and the concert was UNBELIEVABLE!!!! and even better than in the SECC a couple of years before.
3689,The entrance of the cafe is spacious with double doors and a flat surface allowing safe and easy access into the cafe. As you enter the counter is in-front of you with the main seating area to the right this narrowed the path into the cafe yet it was not inaccessible.
3690,It has free parking with plenty of disabled parking spaces beside the many entrances which all have a lift for access into the building. Also there is a bus station located on the side of the building with regular buses which come from across Manchester.
3691,Parking right outside cottage 
3692,The accessible toilet is large and spacious and has the regular grab rails. It is also a higher seat than on regular toilets.
3693,Staff are very accommodating as they are eager to meet all customers needs. They assist if necessary to navigate customers to queue for popcorn and drinks to help speed up the process.
3694,"The coffee and food are good, the location is excellent with stunning views over the Thames."
3695,"Stretching 2.3 km from the Pont de l'Alma (near the Eiffel Tower) to the Musée d'Orsay, and fully wheelchair accessible at both ends, this recently opened promenade features floating gardens in barges (also wheelchair accessible) fun facilities for kids and a variety of eateries, some on moored boats and others on the embankment. A lovely wheel/walk along the Seine with views of historic buildings and bridges. All the facilities are designed to be removable in 24 hours if there is a risk of serious flooding."
3696,"Entrance to the building for wheelchair users and those requiring level access was through a side door immediately opposite the accessible parking bays. This door is usually locked but a handy doorbell will summon assistance and a warm welcome. You wheel in and you are at the edge of the cottage which is up a step or two. The cottage is not wheelchair accessible but a handy plan and pictures give you a good idea of what there is. 

The route to the main exhibition passes by the reception and small shop area. Once inside the exhibition hall it was surprising how large it was. The exhibits were varied and some interactive. "
3697,Stall holders are very friendly and helpful in showing you their produce and helping you make a purchase.
3698,"I did not see a clear sign to say where to wait for a table however, there was a staff member (who I think was a manager) at the entrance when we arrived, and we got seated right away. Where you queue though is very spacious and there is plenty of room for customer to enter or leave whilst others are queuing.

There are no doors to enter this restaurant so, you are able to easily enter.

When I entered, I noticed there were some tables that I wouldn’t be able to get to due to the space in between them very narrow. Luckily there were three table in a row which were very spaced out. All tables were also at a great hight for wheelchair users.


There are some tables across from the entrance, out with the restaurant, but still within the shopping centre."
3699,Staff very friendly and helpful if adaptations needed.
3700,"I went to the Surrealist/Dada exhibition here and I love the fact that the building is an installation in itself with the caption 'Everything is going to be alright' illuminated above the entrance.  I also loved the grounds featuring earth, water pieces along with impressive sculptures by Gormley and Henry Moore and others.  The exhibition itself was a bit heavier on Surrealism than the Dadaism but I still loved it; my favourite was Magritte's 'The Legend of the Centuries'.   It also has a great cafe looking out on lovely gardens with both indoor and outdoor seating.  As the cafe is so popular, space was a bit tight for my wheelchair but people were lovely and moved seats to accommodate me.  Staff were lovely both in the cafe and throughout the gallery, answering art questions for me, operating lifts and giving me a great tip about using the large print information board as the small info print at the paintings is too small for me to read and I can't get close enough in my wheelchair, so thank you for that great tip!"
3701,"The 'staff' I dealt with making the booking were really knowledgeable and helpful.  As was Harry on the day - he was easy to talk to, described the chair and what was expected from us very well.  He showed as where to go to get on the beach.
It was a pleasure  dealing with him"
3702,There is a disabled space outside the church gates which is right outside the club.  There is only one space.  There are disabled parking spaces on either of the car parks.  Both are about 200 metres from the club
3703,"There is ample parking around the Royal Mile, parked on Chambers Street next to the museum however this might not be practical if you have difficulty walking."
3704,"There is ramp access to the front door which opens outwards and is not automatic. It is lightweight though which is good. Once inside, the space is a little tight but the furniture is all easy to move and the owners/people working there could not be more helpful and considerate. If you can, try to get a seat near the window because you get a lovely view over the loch. It's bright and colourful inside, and it's table service so you can sit back and relax. There is also a separate lounge room with a comfy couch and coffee table, quirky wallpaper and lights!"
3705,"The main entrance has stairs leading up to it and this door is not power-assisted. However, there are three alternative entrances.  There is an accessible ramp on the Claremont roadside of the building, which has two accessible routes: one from Claremont Road and one at the front corner of the museum providing level access to the front entrance with power-assisted doors to the reception desk and shop area. On the other side of the entrance towards the Central Motorway, there is an outside platform lift and has level access to power-assisted doors to the entrance of the museum. There is also a back entrance to the Street Café and back area of the museum which has level access and a power-assisted door. However, it is worth noting that the ramps have a relatively steep incline and are quite long - and although I did not have any issues, I have been using my wheelchair for a long time and also have power assistance. 

All videos throughout the museum were subtitled with the majority also having BSL interpretation which was great! On the downside, the interactive screens were really difficult to use. I don't know if this was just the calibration, but it was extremely difficult to click onto an aspect of the interactive screen to get it to work, and often, you had to keep your finger held down for a video to be played - made it really difficult to use (I have joint pain and get frequent dislocations), especially for wheelchair users or those with physical disabilities.

There are two lifts, one is small and does lead to the one door that isn't power assisted! However, the other lift is extremely spacious and would be big enough to include many wheelchair users! The museum is spread out on both the ground and first floor which have complete level access. There are also stairs which have raised tactile indicators on the underside of the handrails and contrasting nosings - useful for anyone who has a visual impairment!

There are large print orientations maps available on request at the reception desk or ahead of visiting. The reception desk also has a bowl of water that can be provided for assistance dogs, and the shop has a telephone for use so that disabled people can get a taxi. There are several induction loop points, including at the Reception Desk, cafés, and interactive points in the galleries.

There is wooden bench seating in the main entrance, and in several of the galleries around the museum. The museum also has a manual wheelchair that can be borrowed as well as portable folding seats which visitors can carry with them. The café has a mixture of leather and wooden chairs with and without arms. "
3706,"It was voted the best view in Britain and while I’m always going to prefer the dales to anything else, the view from Sutton Bank is pretty good as views go!
We went first to the visitor centre expecting that they would have a leaflet with a map on it but instead a very helpful chap drew us a map and explained where to go. Odd that they didn’t have printed maps – maybe they had run out. Their website gives you detailed access details. 
There’s a circular route of about a kilometre which takes you to the (accessible) viewing point with a chart telling you what you are looking at – all the way to the dales! We stopped to have a picnic there – it was a gorgeous day – and it wasn’t particularly busy although no doubt it’s busier at weekends. You can go on a longer route which takes you to the White Horse – I’m sure we’ll be back to do that another day. "
3707,Good sized accessible loo. Only thing its reasonably narrow to get past a pillar from the cafe into the area where the toilets are.
3708,I spoke to a few staff and all of them were nice and present. I accidentally spilled my drink but the member of staff said 'no problem' and went and got me a new drink. Wonderful staff. 
3709,"The theatre charges people in wheelchair full price to sit in the aisle at the edge of the auditorium with the worst view. 
They do have a Disability Access Scheme which offers some discounts, but it takes them two weeks to process an application. I called almost 3 weeks before the show we wanted to see but ""it won't be done in time and you have to pay 7 days in advance, so if you want to come you'll have to pay full price.""
Basic access is good but unlike other theatres where people in wheelchairs are seated with the rest of the public, here you are stuck out on the end. This means you don't quite get to seat with your companions and your wheelchair obstructs access to the seats for able bodies users."
3710,"You have to award 5 stars for the best Ice cream in Blackpool. This is an established family business and has been there for many years. 
There are two areas to this venue.
Take away area that is open to the Street or Sit in small café style idea. 
Please see access for more information."
3711,Ramp access to lodge. Door could be awkward to manage without assistance as its swings back. 
3712,good car park - gravel but wheelchair proof netting so not a problem. Don't think public transport is an option.
3713,Top marks for having a Changing Places toilet on site. Adjacent was an accessible toilet and alongside toilets for everyone.
3714,Perfect toilet.  Good size with everything at the correct height.  Nice toiletries and a good size mirror too.
3715,"Very friendly, very helpful with sound and good advice on anything IT.

Plus the coffee and the cake is great."
3716,Overall access appeared to be very good.
3717,"Very friendly and knowledgeable particularly as it is his own privately built-up collection, and he makes a good cup of tea."
3718,Well Signposted Accessible loo is on a lower floor which can be reached easily through the lift.
3719,"The loo is in one of the restaurants , not adjacent to the main toilets which are upstairs. It takes some finding and I disturbed other diners to reach the loo door. Once inside the loo it takes some manoeuvring to reach the toilet itself. There are support bars and the room is clean but it is not ideal."
3720,Disabled parking opposite entrance 
3721,"4 spaces for disabled lowered kerbs to building entrance but no ramps
bus stops a good ten minutes away and limited crossings"
3722,They have one disabled toilet
3723,"Very friendly, patient and communicate well."
3724,Staff are generally helpful. Each of the accessible viewing areas have designated staff to assist.
3725,"El Aderno, is one of a number of cafe and restaurants in the La Paz area. This cafe specialises in cakes and ice cream."
3726,"Parked right near door, in large under cover area with clearly marked  wide bays"
3727,"There are elevators to the subway system. Tickets are available from machines. If you get stuck there is usuall a Metro employee nearby to assist. There is a wide entry through the gates marked ""canal especialle "". This gate is often closed marked with a red X above the gate. Look for the ""assistance"" button next to the glass screen. It connects via intercom but is almost impossible to hear the operator. Keep saying ""canal especialle "" and someone will come to lt you through. Once you get to the platform there are no easy access carriages. Every carriage has a four inch step and often a gap too. Bear this in mind when you think about using the underground. Otherwise it is a cheap an efficient way of zooming about the city. "
3728,Keith in reception was welcoming but not really clued up accessibility.
3729,"Easy wheelchair access via ramp  to theSpace @ Surgeon's Hall and a lift to the door of venue 53 
Blueswater Presents: Blues!  Staff are incrediblely helpful you can skip the queue if you ask and can be on the front row if you wish........ Wonderful performance highly recommend ......parking might be problematic as it's on the surrounding streets but plenty of public transport "
3730,"They could not do enough to help, but they don't own the pub"
3731,"Very helpful, but couldn't help with the main issue."
3732,Parking was easy with plenty of on street space if you have a Blue Badge. Being in the heart of Elgin there is plenty of public transport. There's a railway station and bus station offering connections to further afield.
3733,Good quality  accessible toilets available in shopping centre (lift access from shop mobility)
3734,The station had a large car park with about 8 disabled bays next to the ramp that takes you into the station building. 
3735,"La Fresnaie is a beautiful cottage with lots of accessibility features and a lot of thought has gone into the design, such as having a covered area for parking, so you are sheltered whatever the weather. The thresholds are low, doorways wide and in the kitchen, the hob is at a lower height. There is a good variety of types of chair both inside and out and plenty of cushions so you can choose what is comfiest for you. The only problem for me was that the dining table was not the sort you can sit at in a wheelchair - at first I used an ordinary chair then we put a book under each table leg to raise it! Outside, you can sit under cover or not as you wish and enjoy the peace and quiet and watch the red squirrels and the buzzards. The local villages are quaint but not necessarily that accessible but there are plenty of supermarkets nearby, many of which do delicious home-made style meals to take away and reheat. The countryside thereabouts is lovely and there is a charming rose garden (La Roseraie) at Lassay-les-Chateaux for a modest and very easily accessible visit - tarmac carpark and fine gravel paths."
3736,"Apart from problems with the ramp mentioned above, and problems with the toilet mentioned below, accessibility is OK."
3737,"It is a nice drive to get to the hotel, intriguing approach, and you can park up in disabled bays right by the hotels entrance, and it’s ramp that is needed to get you into hotel. (SEE PHOTOS 6 to 9)"
3738,"Not as advertised, repairs and maintenance was ongoing."
3739,"Parking directly outside on level access for two vehicles. We drove up via A1 and went via Ashbourne.

"
3740,"The staff here are so helpful and friendly. The make you feel relaxed and welcome, are polite and seem to work well together"
3741,Staff were helpful and cheerful 
3742,"This is a very nice pub to either go for a meal or a couple of beers and have a chat with friends. It is run by Ember Ales, has a good menu choice and a good range of beers too. Lots of tables to choose from, and we have always managed to find ones that a wheelchair will fit under.

The pub is done out very nicely and makes for a good location to sit and eat and chat if that's what you want. 

Overall makes for a good venue for any occasion"
3743,I am basing my rating on the Main Street and the modern shopping centre. Most shops have steps in but staff will come out to you. Don’t expect a coffee stop with a toilet. Head for the shopping centre where you can have one of the best P’s on the Black Sea Coast. 
3744,"In addition to the fully accessible loos, there were also several cubicles with outward opening doors and handrails. I rate this very highly, as there are many people who find this helpful, without needing to occupy a fully accessible loo."
3745,The Quay is a great place to hangout on a weekend morning... You can go out on the 'causewayside' as far as the eye can see. You can also get to the wildfowl 'pond' and see nature in action.
3746,"Absolutely brilliant! This really made the day for us.  Everyone we spoke to was friendly, helpful and knew what they were doing.  Two stewards welcomed us, told us their names and said if there was anything we needed to just ask.  "
3747,"There are various disabled accessible toilets within the park, however there is not one at the car park meaning that you have to walk into the park first to find this. They are all level access and large, with wide doors making it easy for a wheelchair user and carer(s) to be present. In the Safari Cafe toilet, there is a hoist, which is ideal if this is required. The toilets themselves are high, which is beneficial for anybody transferring from a wheelchair to the toilet independent or with assistance. 
"
3748,Disabled toilets on various floors. Lifts okay. Disabled access doors.
3749,Prompt and smiling. Nothing to fault.
3750,"I am not a wheelchair user, therefore I didn't require a ramp. But, on the whole, I found access to be generally good. I've given it four stars because my host didn't have the key to get into the cabin and didn't seem to know how to access it for a while. 

There is a light dimmer, bright reading light, and sockets close to your bed which are in easy reach if you're not a wheelchair user. Wheelchair users may struggle with the sockets, but everything else is reasonably close. "
3751,Staff were very helpful. The room stewards on each floor would call the lift for me.
3752,Blue badge spaces but all taken
3753,"Exhibition hall is acoustically very uncomfortable for hearing aid users
Poor hearing loop signage in the theatre
Hearing loop volume is set too low
Digital interaction with the large map installation is inaccessible to those with sight loss and those with poor dexterity
Information boards are inaccessible to those with visual impairment"
3754,Staff were helpful and informative.
3755,"Ramp access to the visitor centre and cafe with automatic doors at the entrance. The toilets are in a separate building with level access. The most accessible route, the Waterfall Trail is well marked. There are a few slopes but the surface was firm and in good condition. I don't believe the scooters are available right now as only cafe staff are working at present.
Access to the red squirrel hide is more tricky with a steep incline, I think that maybe it would be suitable for scooter users but it might be difficult for manual wheelchair users.
Once in the hide there is a cut out so that wheelchair users can position themselves close to the lookout. We did spot two red squirrels and lots of birds while we were there. "
3756,"Access to the library is fairly good with disabled parking outside, ramped access, automatic doors, and an accessible toilet."
3757,Several disabled parking spaces very close to the main entrance.
3758,"Accessible supermarket and café/restaurant.
There is also a pharmacy and opticians.
It is quite a big supermarket so there is a lot of walking. 
The tills and self scan/shop as you go aren't at an accessible hight for wheelchairs but the staff are happy to help.
Café/restaurant has allergy friendly foods and staff are knowledgable about ingredients for allergies. The cafe is accessible and there's room to move my wheelchair around the tables and chairs.
Friendly helpful staff both in the supermarket and in the café.
Lift to second floor which is quite big.
Plenty of nearby parking for blue badge holders either in designated disabled parking bays or you can use the parent and child spaces if need be.
There are manual and mobility scooters to hire which are a first-come-first served basis.
There are also wheelchair friendly shooting trollies.
Unfortunately the tills, self-service and shop as you go aren't at an accessible hight if you're in a wheelchair/power chair/mobility scooter.
Accessible toilet (which has a great sign on that says ""not all disabilities are visible"")"
3759,"There is a large car park just for disabled people near the main entrance, I'd guess 20 spaces additionally there are more spaces in the main car park which number 20 also"
3760,When you get to Colston Hall you should be happy with the access. It looked very good for anyone with sensory or mobility problems. I had no issues with access anywhere within the venue.
3761,All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful
3762,I travelled by bus - there are good bus links that come nearby so long as you don't mind a short walk over there.
3763,"When I booked I made the assumption that it would be alright as it has a lift. When I arrived at the hotel there were about 8 stairs with a handrail on the right hand side only, which was the only way to get into the hotel. Once you have got up these stairs there is a small lift to the bedrooms. The breakfast room was only accessible by a small flight of stairs so I didn't use this facility. On leaving the lift there were no further steps to my bedroom. The roof terrace was accessible by lift and a few stairs with a handrail."
3764,"The staff were very helpful and very willing to answer my questions. They made it very clear that when a person calls requiring disabled access, it goes through to a mobile that is on their person at all times."
3765,Ample parking spaces and space. It is a beautiful country house set out in a spacious park.
3766,"The hotel was booked for an overnight stay to avoid the M25 on the day of a flight. It was easy to find, mostly easy to get into and the room was great. No aircraft noise in our room. Perfect wet room."
3767,Very friendly - seemed to genuinely enjoy serving customers. All looked smart and had branded uniforms also adding to 'time gone by' feel!
3768,"Staff are always on the floor and easily reached if you are in need of assistance.
There are also play leaders on the equipment to assist children if need be.
The staff are very friendly and always manage to fulfill my need."
3769,"The hotel has excellent disabled access. It had the usual facilities you would expect to find in a Premier Inn hotel restaurant, bar area and there was also a Costa Coffee. The communal areas were step free, with lifts. 

I had reserved an accessible room with walk in shower and when I arrived I was allocated what I had requested and I was pleased with the layout and cleanliness of my room.

The hotel although a little bit out of the main city centre has excellent public transport links, which made the location very easy to get to.

The only thing which I felt could be improved upon was the queuing, when I arrived the machine didn't accept my booking, there was a queue at receiption and I had to stand about 5 - 8 minutes before I was served. When I got the receiption I suggested that they have some fold up seats so people with mobility impairments can join, but don't have to stand in the queue. Likewise in the morning queuing for breakfast at the restaurant. These were little things that could make things a lot better for disabled customers, but it wouldn't put me off returning. "
3770,Spacious and well signed blue badge parking.
3771,"We were able to disembark in front of the cottage, unload and move the car to the carpark on-sight. Easy access to the cottage- all on the flat."
3772,Probably tricky to park nearby  other than some on street parking.  Plenty buses stop nearby.
3773,"We used public buses, and bus stops involved a little pushing, but easy enough over uneven paving at times, and a number of routes to pick from with a little research."
3774,This fully accessible accommodation sleeps 6 people and is run by Spinal Injuries Scotland. It is fantastic for wheelchair users.
3775,"I visited Southampton Pride during a visit 'down South'. It was my first Pride, so I wasn't too sure what to expect. What I found was brilliant: it was a fully accessible venue, laid out over an open street plan with grassy areas to sit and accessible toilets. All grassy areas had edgings around them, but they also had ramps situated at strategic points to ensure wheelchair users could access the grassy areas for some sun worshiping (it was a cracking day!). The main stage (the only stage I visited, so I can't comment for others) had a BSL interpreter for all acts and interim crowd entertainers, it seemed to be the same BSL interpreter all day though so I'm sure she must've been exhausted by the end of it! The ramps, coupled with the provision of accessible toilets and Mobiloo being on-site made for an extremely enjoyable experience. The only reason I've not given it 5-stars is because some of the steps didn't have highlights on them so, as a visually impaired person, I sometimes found it a bit challenging navigating those. 

Overall it was a fantastically enjoyable experience where everyone, no matter who you were or what your story was, was made to feel welcome. "
3776,Accessible throughout and Chief Executive is thoroughly committed to good access to all its services. 
3777,"Small 29 roomed hotel in the centre of St Martin de Re, the largest town on Ile de Re.  Hotel as 2 accessible bedrooms on ground floor. Hotel only serves breakfast. However there are numerous restaurants and cafes very close by."
3778,freshly baked cakes and damn fine hot chocolate. what's not to love?
3779,"Great place to have a coffee and brunch! Bright, spacious cafe with seating at different levels. Friendly staff."
3780,"Not a changing places loo, but pretty good and loads of space."
3781,There is disabled parking close to the entrance but the closest was full by mid morn.
3782,"The biggest challenge was getting into the woods. With the exception of Teversal Visitor Centre, which had an open entry point, all the other entry points seemed to have some kind of barrier... gate, A-frame, big block of wood, etc. We almost gave up, it was so bad... but I'm glad we persisted.

Once inside, there are many paths, mostly wide and compacted gravel. There are some extremely steep hills but you can go where you like and choose routes that suit you. There are several trails that are old railway lines, so they are mostly flat. You can do short circular walks or long there and back trails. 

It was excellent for dog walking as there are no vehicles allowed on the trails. We passed a couple of cyclists and there was sufficient horse manure to suggest people ride there, but we didn't see any. We will definitely go back there as the walks were perfect for us... however, they should look at some RADAR locked gates to improve accessibility!"
3783,Everyone was so helpful and friendly.
3784,No transport for disabled - bare minimum disabled parking 
3785,"We used the car, not really feasible to use public transport "
3786,"There is a bus stop nearby & taxis can be found in the area, although it is some distance from an accessible tube station."
3787,"Able to park right by the reception.  Staff will valet park if required (if all disabled spots taken), and offer to carry all bags / equipment to the room."
3788,"The ground is on Coatbridge Main St not far from the Coatdyke Roundabout. 
There are a number of turnstiles to go through to enter the ground. Once through the gate you can go left or right up a number of steps to get to the football park its self you also require to go this way to enter the stand. The stand is very old and dates back to the 1920s. 
However it is well maintained"
3789,"Automatic doors and wide aisles make access to and within the store easy, and there is a capacious lift up to café level. Sometimes the stacks of parked trolleys outside the store narrow the pavement considerably and create congestion, and that's the only reason we aren't giving 5 stars in this category."
3790,"We were camping next to the grounds of this beautiful castle and gardens.
We've been before and couldn't wait to go back."
3791,Adapted room good. Bathroom good but grab rails not in the useful places.
3792,"Security, ticket collectors and tour guide were very welcoming, friendly and informative. A really relaxing tour."
3793,restaurant is run by staff and volunteers - everyone is very very friendly - I go twice a week except for the summer holidays.
3794,really helpful
3795,"there was slight signs but it was not easy to find. 
however stewards where more then happy to help "
3796,"A wheelchair accessible Christian community church situated within the Meadowhead area of Sheffield. The community church is conveniently located within a small shopping precinct and all members of the public are very welcome. Every Tuesday morning a food bank is run from the community church and coincides with the church's coffee morning and Citizen's Advice Bureau drop in clinic. The food bank offers support to those in crisis and in order to access the food bank service you must have a formal referral into the service. Visit www.gracefoodbanksheffield.org.uk, or contact the referral helpline on 07580 516 512 for more information. In the afternoon on a Tuesday a cooking class takes place, which involves the community cooking a nutritional meal together and then eating it in each other’s company.  All volunteers are very welcoming and will spend time chatting to you over a cup of tea/coffee."
3797,"The Motor Museum is highly accessible - ramps, lifts to get you to all three levels.  All displays were at the right height for me in the borrowed mobility scooter.  The scooter  I had on free hire was brilliant - easy to operate after a short teach in from the staff, who helped me into it and safely stored my own wheelchair.  I've deducted half a star for the tiny areas I couldn't access.  These were frankly insignificant though. Palace House had the brilliant DVD for me, with two helpful staff in costume who helpfully gave me lots of extra information.  The grounds had nice even paths.  The restaurant had a clearly marked sloping path taking me to the automatic doors.  Plenty of room in Museum, House and restaurant (plus Top Gear and other displays) to turn a scooter or wheelchair."
3798,Really friendly and helpful. Always make me feel very comfortable.
3799,"I felt confident that all necessary equipment and adaptations would be in place and I was not disappointed. My husband was able to use a fully accessible bathroom, increasing his sense of independence. Highlights were the proximity to Carsington Water, where he was able to take part in Sailability, the rental of a Tramper, again at Carsington and the mighty off road Boma wheelchair, available for hire at Hoe Grange. 
I can recommend the hiring of the wood fired hot tub too!
When we needed help, the owners of the property were able to give me support.
The only thing I found a slight challenge was the lack of a washing machine in the property. There was, however, a machine we could use in the laundry room.
The weather was absolutely beautiful and we will be returning in the near future.
Sue and Steve"
3800,"Very friendly, no complaints here"
3801,Fully accessible
3802,An experience that left me as a wheelchair user feeling I was being tolerated rather than welcomed.
3803,"Street parking, close to bus station and train station."
3804,"As the building attracts many visitors per day I thought there should be more disabled toilets. However the toilets provided were large enough to maneuver a wheelchair and for a carer and service user can both move around easily, grab rails were also provided. "
3805,"Best car shopping experience I have ever had . Friendly , helpful and approachable staff who were sensitive and considerate to my needs , and helped me achieve a positive experience. "
3806,It is well worth accessing Vicarage Farm Holiday Cottages web-site as they have an excellent photo gallery and information regarding dimensions of doorways and equipment available.
3807,Please see issues in the summary
3808,Teapot Island is a small museum of wall to ceiling shelves of novelty shaped teapots - around 8000. There is a lovely cafe selling home cooked food (which we really enjoyed)  and a small gift shop selling teapots that are 'doubles' where there is already one of them in the museum.  They have seating indoors and outdoors and the area is next to the river if you fancy a walk like we did.  There are also some naught top shelf teapots to spot and every topic under the sun. You can also see the work of a local potter and paint a pot.
3809,"A great place to eat, good value food, wine, beer, wine and spirits. Very family and disability friendly, if you or your children have special food needs, tell them either when you book or walk in from the street. The have a detailed list of potential problem foods and will cater for this. I learned this via a family who had a young child with very limited diet. They bent over themselves to help, and the family had a great meal and a great time.
Separate disabled/wheelchair access. If booked/reserved, they can easily provide easily accessible tables, also, if you go in on most days, the lower level is available and the staff will sort you out.
Food/ drink is ordered from the bar, if you have someone who can go to the bar to say you are disabled, or pre-book, they are more than happy to provide table service and end of meal payment.
Menu goes from Bar-Snacks, great Burgers to Main courses with options. Great value.
Main problem if you are a wheelchair user, you need help to get up to, and down from, disabled toilet, due to skew wiff ramp. DO NOT rely on rails, as they come away under weight.
Have, and will, revisit, as minor problems are overcome by great atmosphere, food and staff."
3810,when visiting the car park states that it is full but when you look around there are a few disabled parking spots available but the car park won't let you in
3811,Top marks for the staff. We received a warm welcome and everyone we met was friendly and helpful.
3812,"The sport centre is level access throughout with cafe, sports halls and ice rinks on the ground floor, and lift access to the first floor where you’ll find the spacious gym area, studios and lounge/restaurant/viewing area overlooking the ice rink."
3813,"Columbia coffee lounge stands out as one of the best cafes in town. It is situated down a side road at the top of the town centre, which makes for a perfect quiet spot to take a break from shopping or meet up with friends. 
They offer an extensive cafe menu, from breakfasts to never ending sandwich and panini combinations, to imaginative milkshakes and most importantly 'to die for cakes' with lovely large portion sizes.
The staff are friendly and welcoming and there are plenty of places to sit - upstaires and downstaires. 
The cafe has level access for wheelchair users, as well as space to maneuver and a large disabled toilet.  
When the weather is pleasant enough, or if you are daring, there is outdoor seating available to watch the world go by. 
There is plenty of parking in Scunthorpe town centre, and with the new 2 hours free parking policy introduced in all of the council car parks, there is plenty of time to get parked up and spend a leisurely time at the cafe"
3814,"Large square with benches, its spacious and accessible."
3815,"I had a broken foot and used the tour bus to see all the sites in Barcelona but when I arrived at the stop for Park Güell, I realised that even taking a taxi would only take me a few hundred metres closer. We went off to find a restaurant for lunch and found a great one used by the hospital staff and we spotted an outdoor moving stairs, similar to the type you find in a department store.  It took us close to the exit for the park but we did not mind visiting Park Güell, counter clockwise.  My foot healed but I have always been glad that had a spot of luck on the day and were able to enjoy the park bathed in beautiful sunshine on a crispy cold January day"
3816,A wheelchair accessible restaurant with a range of food choices including vegan. Located at the entrance to Almondvale Shopping Centre.
3817,"Dark, no handrails."
3818,"Dropped kerb outside, not flush with a slight gradient, leading to two automatic doors to get in. Operated by your room card in the evening. Small accessible reception desk, where you have to wait for staff to appear. Could not see a bell, no induction loop, clear perspex box to drop your key in when leaving. Would be difficult for unaccompanied people with hearing or sight impairments.  Corridor to rooms limited in space and opened with room card. Limited signage."
3819,"There are a couple of free standing tables and chairs on the pavement outside the restaurant. There is a single step with no hand rail inside, at both entrances. Inside there are free standing tables and chairs."
3820,"There was one disabled parking space, which was, of course, already taken."
3821,"No staff as such, but owner was helpful and considerate, and available whenever we needed her"
3822,"My only way to get out on my own is by using my foldable scooter however Tyneside Metro do not allow scooter use within their stations, not even to get from the street to the platform. This is highly frustrating as powered wheelchairs are allowed. If only they allowed folding scooter use up to the platforms it would enable use by thousands. If you have a folding scooter it must be folded at the entrance and wheeled through the station and onto the metro, but as many of the stations are very large this makes it unaccessible to people who can only walk very short distance 10-50 metres - it can be quite a feat to pull a folable scooter more than a few metres for many disabled people. It is my intention to approach them to get this changed.

There is already a review for wheelchair use within the metro system which I fully agree with so wont write more on that. "
3823,"There is an accessible toilet in the main building, which has step free access. I visited during covid precautions, so I was accompanied into the building where the accessible toilet is. It was is clean and the grab rails are very sturdy, my transfers aren't very good at the moment and I felt very safe, no wobbly rails. The room is quite spacious, but the location of the sanitary bin and fold up table might need moving to enable a wheelchair user to manoeuvre in the space. There is no emergency red cord.

Please note the gardens are about 5 - 10 minutes away from King's Cross Train Station which has a changing places toilet."
3824,Helpful and accommodating when I booked - told me everything I needed to know. Staff member quick to assist with doors on way in and out.
3825,The library staff are always happy to help with anything you might need.
3826,Most of the staff are very helpful but as a one-time frequent user of the low level trains I did encounter some who were rude and unfriendly. One time I was refused the use of the ramp despite being there before the train arrived. The driver saved the day by getting out of the cabin and getting the on train ramp for me!
3827,Brilliant! They've put a lot of thought into their accessibility. There is a ramp to the side of the main steps at the entrance. There is a decent sized lift serving all floors. There are helpful large print guides located at the entrance to most of the main galleries. The one place that was a little crowded was the shop.
3828,"Regular spacious multiuse toilet, "
3829,Lovely. And when they had to kick us out (our alotted two hours having been far exceeded) they were really apologetic! Booking confirmation came quickly too.
3830,"The exhibition is in a temporary venue in Kensington Gardens. The gardens themselves have a flat path through them.

Entry to the exhibition is by ramp, and then is flat smooth surface throughout. All doorways and corridors are wide.

When you first go in there is a display of Van Goughs art in prints, with explanations beside them. 
I was really impressed that with each of these there is the option to scan a code beside them, and get a signed or audio description on your phone of each picture. 

In the main space, it is a very large room, where the immersive experience is. There are a few seats available if you require, but the majority of people sit (or lie) wherever they want on the floor itself.
I guess this could make navigation a bit tricky if you had mobility/visual impairment, but staff are very attentive and I don't think would be any difficulty. 

The room is filled with full-height screens at different angles. Van Goughs art shows on these screens but it is a constantly moving display, set to classical music. 

The sunflower room could perhaps be tight for larger wheelchairs and definitely for scooters, however this is a very small part of the whole experience and could easily be missed out. (You can see the whole thing from the doorway, it's mostly filled with people taking selfies)
"
3831,"Everytime I have stayed at The Crowne Plaza all staff have been extremely friendly and helpful. When we spoke to 2 of the managers about the issues we had during our stay, they seemed to take what we said on board, we'll just see if things change for the better."
3832,"Each Cottage has its own designated parking space, suitable for Wheelchair Access Vehicles. Disabled ""Blue Badge"" Parking in the district was mostly Free. There is a bus stop outside the property."
3833,"I know that there has been a previous review of this venue but it would appear that Manchester Arena have taken note.

I booked the tickets by telephone after accessing the Ticketmaster website. There were no problems with this at all and the tickets arrived a few days later. I also booked a parking space in the NCP car park adjacent to the arena; this was done on the NCP web site and it was really easy and  surprisingly reasonably priced. There were also plenty of disabled spaces when I arrived although I was not able to specify this on the web site.

After parking, it took about a minute to reach the venue where I was told by security to go to the front of the queue from where I was  shown to a lift which took me up to the main concert area. The crowd was really buzzing with anticipation at this point! There was then a security check where I had a quick search and after that was directed through a corridor which had ample space for my power chair. I was then on a semi-circular, wheelchair accessible viewing platform which had good viewing access without being separated from the crowd. There was nobody behind or in front of me at this level although it was quite far back from the main stage. I was quite happy with this as it was more to do with the size of the venue and it was the same for everybody else apart from everyone in the pit.

It was a fantastic night, so loud you could feel the vibrations through the floor and the crowd were ecstatic to the point where the Pilots had to do very little singing; the crowd were doing it for them!   "
3834,"Parking near to the front door, level access, plenty of space, a cafe and accessible loo."
3835,"This is one of Englands oldest coaching inns, dating from the 13th century, with stone walls, oak beams and open fireplaces, lovely staircases, little passages and corridors, With old paintings and engravings which are seen throughout the hotel. 
In 1279 a Robert Marshall owned a plot of land by the church, 
and it seems that by the 16th century, it was an inn, owned by innkeeper Jerome Westall. During 1593, it is known the name The Bear was in use for the inn or tavern owned by William Rayer. On his death, his son, Thomas Rayer had control, at that that time the inn had nine hearths and open fires. The inn then became the property of the Fennymore family, who were 
wealthy maltsters.
Interestingly, the tenant from 1690 to 1720 was a Thomas Green, nicknamed “jockey” and the inn was used by the Woodstock racing members. The inn had at least 15 bedrooms by now. Then followed rebuilding work in 1728, but soon after this it closed, and it seems it may have remained unused as property until 1751, as indication show that timber and stone from the property was being sold off, but a Bernard Cross took over , but by 1757-58 his son Charles Cross became the owner, and the Bear again became a prominent coaching inn.
However, he became bankrupt in 1789 and the inn was sold to the Duke of Marlborough. This family held the inn and by now there were 25 bedrooms and stables for 60 horses.
By the 1820.s there were enough beds for 50 guests, and now, 80 horses, and it was the busiest of the coaching inns, and Blenheim coach company used it as its starting point.
Then in the 20th century it was Woodstocks main hotel.

During the 16th century, glove making was Woodstocks main industry, and sheep and deer hide gloves were being sawn by local women in their homes, as well as factory workers in the town. This legacy can be seen in the Bear hotel, with a nice display of gloves to view as you walk through the archway and up to reception area over to the left of the courtyard, as part of this hotel used to be a glove workshop, operating as late as 1974. There is a lovely but small open courtyard once through the archway, and it’s a pleasant place to enjoy a cool drink on warm sunny days.
Another tradition has been kept at the back of the hotel grounds, and it’s that of bee keeping, and the resident bee keeper collects this honey to be used in the hotels restaurant.
During the colder months you may sit indoors in the bar area, by a roaring fire, with wooden chairs and tables, quite a nice place to relax with a glass in hand.
To enhance its past, the hotel still offers that sense of history, which can be seen in its deco throughout, although some may feel it’s lost its grandness of times past and lives on its old reputation, but it’s position in the village still makes it worth visiting, so let’s see what the hotel offers us today.

OUR REVIEW
Try to find a parking spot close to Market place and town hall (photo 1). Then across the street stands The Bear hotel, 
alongside quaint 15th century cottages and the church on Park 
street (2).  To get into the hotel, use the entrance through the archway (3) as it’s nice and level (4) which brings you to a delightful courtyard, which is a nice place to sit on sunny days. (5). There are two entrances for you now, over to the left of courtyard is the reception, (6) and over to the right hand corner is the narrow door (which we could just get our wheelchair through) for the bar and restaurant. (7)
There is a lovely entrance hall inside,  BUT MIND the small step down into the corridor (8) with bay windows of what may have been little shops, as they still are today but only window shopping.
This leads to the bar area, quite attractive but very plain (9) with a lovely log fire which gave out warmth on this cold February day,  There’s plenty of room for your wheelchair (10) as you settle in to choose your drink of the day (11).
Coming out, unfortunately, there is no lift in this graded 
building, only the staircase to the bedrooms (12).
Opposite is a very appealing restaurant, inviting, with a huge stone fireplace (13) and it’s beautifully set out, plenty of room between tables, (14) and set in the brickwork walls, the sort of room you want to go into for dinner as it has charm and character (15).

OUR FINAL THOUGHTS
It’s worth a visit to this 13th century  inn, a beautiful place in parts inside, but it’s lost its old appeal of years gone bye according to some, and we were disappointed the restaurant was not open during the winter months for lunch, but you can get snacks and light dishes in the plain unattractive bar area, but it’s warm in there at least.
However, we feel this is not really a wheelchair friendly hotel, the door into bar and restaurant is rather narrow, our wheelchair just got in, and we feel a wider chair of any kind may struggle , and then there is a small step to get down. My husband could at least get up off chair while I pushed it down, then got in again to get to bar area, which was on the flat at least. The upstairs bedrooms have charm of sorts according to photos we have seen, but they all looked smallish, and although decorated out with historical appeal, there’s no way a disabled person could use them. 
Dissapointing I,m afraid, we were looking forward to more, but it’s in an ideal spot for visiting Woodstock, ( as our other review of Woodstock will show you )
So we cannot really recommend this hotel for you."
3836,Very helpful friendly staff that brought drinks to the table without being asked.
3837,"900 service to and from Glasgow, brilliant - no more trains for me, every 15 minutes between each Cityi, I travelled to the ace Station by bus, did not notice if there was nearby parking. Ample buses stop at or nearby Killermont Road where the Station is located."
3838,Although it’s an old building it has pretty good access. It’s on multiple levels But there is a lift. There was adequate sized accessible toilets and the changing area poolside was quite compact if with a carer. The weights room was quite small. The gym area was a bit bigger but had upper body equipment that wheelchair users can use. There was reasonable space to move around in.
3839,Friendly staff and  mostly good-looking!
3840,"We booked a family break at The Moat House in Annan for 3 nights over the weekend. The place was spacious, well presented accomodation and met our expectations in many ways! The disabled facilities were unrivalled from profiling beds and ceiling hoists found in rooms upstairs and downstairs to the height-adjustable kitchen units made this quite suitable, primarily for one family member who is wheelchair-bound.
There were also fun things for the kids to do, such as partake in one of the many board games provided or play the piano (for the entertainment of the rest 😁)
As the whole property is accessible, both internally (with the passenger lift) and externally with ramps, everyone was able to enjoy all the areas of the house. 
There were only a couple of slight and I mean slight issues that was firstly the profiling being a wider one, which did not suit the wheelchair user and she required the handrails to assist with her transfers and couldn't reach them. It was known beforehand and so was of no fault of the propery owners.
The other thing was the cleanliness. We have exceptionally high standards of cleanliness within our own homely environments and whilst the property was clean, we felt it could have been a bit cleaner (being a tad harsh.)
Overall, was an enjotable stay at The Moat House and for the layout and attention to detail to meet the needs of those requiring it, full credit is due to the owners! I would highly recommend this place for those who have physical disabilities and/or to those who like that bit ot convenience and functionality where they stay."
3841,The Loch Ness Centre sits in the village of Drumnadrochit and we found lots to do and see.  An Exhibition learning more of the history of the Loch tells of its history as you walk around the ‘galleries’ and hear of the events of the past. It’s not all about a monster yet to be found!
3842,Not sure as we arrived by train. I think there is some disabled parking in the car park.
3843,being able to get all the way around and the beautiful views
3844,For use by all customers. 
3845,A great hub for getting the tram or changing to one of the many buses that stop at the adjacent bus stops.
3846,"There are 2 steps within the cottage to get down into  the kitchen, but our host had supplied a steel ramp to allow access for wheelchair/rollator. Some people may find the low comfortable leather sofa a bit challenging to climb out of.  Bedrooms good size for access, and very comfortable. "
3847,"The staff were bizarre. The person serving coffee did not understand basic English, and was unable to respond clearly. Another member of staff was rather officious about the back area of the café being closed and out of bounds. Further stars lost because of the staff's failure to maintain the red emergency cord in the toilet as required."
3848,"Fantastic.
I was even offered water for my assistance dog"
3849,"This is a ''Witherspoon's'' establishment.  VERY reasonably priced.  Certainly not ''haute cuisine'' but fair quality stuff. Burgers, steak, fish and chips, sausage and mash (a good choice on offer)"
3850,Had a disabled access ramp at the back through the car park .Access to the carpark  through the barrier  very difficult walking with a wheelchair involving manipulation of barrier. Entrance closed to be opened from inside . Beside Access from ramp blocked by people in the bar. Gave up and managed with lots of help to get my son up the stairs.
3851,"All the staff we encountered were friendly enough, and tried to help us, possibly FAWSLEY Hall hotel needed to be more friendly, but in general all was well."
3852,All very easy
3853,"Excellent visit to see the lights and hear the sounds of the botanical gardens Christmas illuminated trail, with  other Euan's Guide ambassadors and staff. It was longer and better than I expected, and improved by hot mulled wine and toasted marshmallows and great company! The highlight for me was the pictures that appeared on the path when you trod / wheeled over them."
3854,I could still sit with my family and watch in the seating area but could actually bowl due to a step/drop to get to the bowling alley which is a shame. It’s also very sensory overload and loud and busy in namco.  
3855,"Nice flat site with well-kept, smooth tarmac paths and only one or two small gravelly places. I could get up close to almost all the zoo animals (who looked well cared-for) and join in the feeding of the farm animals with the children in our party. There was a gentle ramp into the cafe and plenty of space in the level picnic area."
3856,"All our help is provided for you on our part one review, so please read this advice."
3857,There is substantial parking places and people who have a disability are allowed to drive to the front of the building
3858,On street parking and regular busses to Morningside. Not a very well-lit street outside the cinema.
3859,"All joking aside this shop is really dam accessible, great wide aisles, ramps and lifts. Brilliant."
3860,"The entrance to Queen’s Court is a series of two manual doors, one after the other. However, they are both lightweight and spaced wide enough apart to make getting through in a wheelchair easy, and the first may even be propped open depending on the weather. Most of the tables are at a good height to access from a wheelchair, and chairs can be moved around to accommodate people. The ramps between the different tiers (Queen’s Court is on a hill) are wide enough, but in places can be very steep.
All areas are accessible, including the bar and courtyard.
"
3861,There are a number of disabled parking bays available.
3862,"Decently equipped loo, but no alarm and baby changing table by the door may make manoeuvres constrained for larger chaira"
3863,Super friendly people!
3864,"nice place, welcoming and friendly
lots to do and see
"
3865,We didn't use the toilet facilities during our visit and I don't remember seeing any signs for such but we did visit the 'Silver Street toilets while I the city centre and was pleasantly surprised by a full changing places facility despite not being badged as such (radar key entry)
3866,No changing places but there are two reasonably sized accessible toilets available. There is a changing place a few minutes walk away near old Market Square that I know of.
3867,"rating for parking as do not want to review ourselves.
Coach parking drop of and collect points at Albert docks, very convenient for passengers and our coach has access lift, Large floor level toilet that expands for Wheelchair room also seats with extra leg room and wheelchair spaces to be firmly secured in place, on board games to encourage socialising in large print."
3868,Lots of paid parking of good quality. Disabled bays few and far between but city is not designed around cars. Shopmobility free scooter and wheelchair use available. 
3869,The staff were lovely. However the lifts were very difficult to get an electric wheelchair in the lift  (we managed eventually) and the changing place was very small with the bed only having excess from one side. But the staff were lovely and the expeditions were well spaced with no worry of accidently damaging anything. 
3870,"I have given the 5 stars for the parking as I have not experienced the public transport but Nairn is on the main bus and rail routes between Inverness and Aberdeen. Although there are frequent buses and trains, you would have to walk about half a mile from the train station to the walk and a quarter of a mile from the bus station. 

There are several car parks right beside the walk and there is usually plenty of space as well as several disabled parking spaces. I have never had a problem parking."
3871,"Odeon Cinema is located outside the centre of Huddersfield, next to the Galpharm Stadium, which is sign posted from Leeds Road, Huddersfield. Is easy to find and is not situated on a rod that has a steep gradient. A large car park is available with sufficient parking spaces."
3872,"There were lots of people about and from the beefeater/guard at the gates to those at the information desk and in the gardens', everyone was very helpful and keen to help."
3873,Fort Kinnaird Retail Park has plenty parking and each outlet there has disabled parking spaces directly outside as well as 'free' parking in general. There are a variety of buses both from central Edinburgh and East Lothian with good service. 
3874,There are various car parks and on street parking in the university area beside the Meadows. Plenty buses pass by on the main roads and there are wide smooth paths connecting all entrances and exits to the park. Watch out for cyclists!
3875,"Getting to hotel is easy enough if you follow Sat NAV carefully, but it is a little difficult to get into hotel itself, as you can only use the pull door outside, so you will need help, but it’s just about wide enough to get wheelchairs through and into reception, but getting out I needed to pull my husband through the narrow door. We are not sure about any powerchairs though, you would have to check with hotel first.  It’s all on the level, and two lifts are available and quite a good size, so no worries there. We could see and get to everything we needed. Lots of seating areas to relax in."
3876,the garden is accessible through a side gate off the platform and down a ramp
3877,"No hearing loop or braille as far as I could see, hence the half star, but we weren't travelling with anyone who needed one. Except for a tiny lip y the front door, everything on the ground floor is on a single even floor. (There is an upper floor not suitable for people with mobility issues, but for other travellers.)"
3878,Staff were friendly enough and eager to help.
3879,"Not a good place for wheelchair users. The basement, which contains over half the goods on sale at this branch, is reachable only by a staircase. "
3880,Staff were helpful and welcoming 
3881,The bathroom is very roomy with plenty of space for wheelchairs and carers. The shower is a walk in and has a chair. The toilet has grab rails around but is low.
3882,"Parking in carpark next to the museum. Transport, Dunfermline Station."
3883,"The staff, especially the security team were first class."
3884,Really friendly and helpful. Wee problem with the accessibility of the room but they did everything they could to help.
3885,Other than the manual doors into the museum (hit or miss if someone assisted) the access in the museum was very good.  All on the flat as was the area outside.  I didn't go around the salt pands but found a super viewing area to watch my wife do so.
3886,"Searching for a good Edinburgh cinema venue to visit with quadriplegic father. From access to road to back of the IMAX (the screen we visited) no steps entirely one level and easy to access in a wheel chair. The screen slopes down from ground level to -1 (lower ground level) so is ideal for disabled access.

See included photos of viewing place at the IMAX screen - wheelchair gets excellent view of the screen again with plenty of space to manoeuvre. "
3887,"There was an assistance bell at the front door of Pizza Express to alert staff if required, although the door was permanently propped open (unfortunately with an advertisement board which may need to be moved to allow access for some wheelchair or powerchair users) and the entire front of the restaurant was glass. Inside the tables were spaced a nice distance apart, and most of the chairs were movable which made tables accessible to wheelchair users. The lighting was nice and bright throughout the restaurant. My visually impaired friend was made to feel completely welcome and staff were quick to help with any requests we had."
3888,"Excellent all round access both in the complex and surrounding areas including the restaurants and bars,only drawback as i mentioned is the small lifts on the complex that are a problem if you cannot get out of your wheelchair and the apartments themselves are not specifically disabled friendly  but i manage and i only have a small amount of movement now."
3889,Good and spacious.
3890,"The accessible access in Schagen is excellent, but on Paasvee, it can become really congested with visitors and difficult to maneuver, so be sure to arrive early."
3891,So friendly and eager to help.
3892,No problems - paths are either paved or tarmac and the slopes up to bridges are shallow.
3893,There are public toilets that visitors to the Harbour can use. We didn't need to use the loo - but were delighted to see a Changing Places sign!! Totally unexpected... We will definitely be recommending Whitstable Harbour as a place to visit now...
3894,We arrived and got our table . Great atmosphere. Typical Mexican restaurant . Lively
3895,A wheelchair assessable world class ski and snowboard resort with awesome slope and a great adaptive ski program.
3896,Accessible around the side with a small step/lip. Once inside there is a accessible toilet and ramp to bar level.
3897,Loo is in the arts centre. Clear signage to help finf it.
3898,"Much of the cathedral is accessible. There are ramps to access most areas and just a couple of parts which have steps. Considering the age of the building and its layout, I think they have done a very good job. The cafe and toilets are via a lift and several automatic doors. The cafe was well laid out and we enjoyed lunch there. We took the outside route back to avoid the lift (which is quite small for my trike) but it was a long way round and by the time we got back to the front, we decided we'd seen everything anyway, and went down the steep hill back into town."
3899,"Top marks for the loos. Westfield has a Changing Places Toilet as wheel as several conventional accessible loos. All well signposted, clean and easy to access."
3900,"There is a very low step on entry to The Lucky Liquor Co. which could be an issue for some wheelchair-users, although the bar manager told  us they are expecting a portable ramp designed specifically for the venue to arrive soon. Inside, the venue is small, but it definitely isn't cramped. The tables and moveable chairs don't take up a lot of space and there is a very clear, wide route to the bar and accessible toilet. We visited late on a Saturday night and it wasn't crowded; in fact it was a great atmosphere. Be aware that the bar is quite high and there aren't any dropped counters, however we received table service all night so this isn't too much of an issue. There are actually two levels to this venue, but the basement level is down a narrow set of stairs and may be inaccessible to some people. There is only one bar however, and that is on the ground floor, level with the street. The lighting level is low but not dark and the music isn't excessively loud."
3901,"A few were a bit surly but the majority were approachable, friendly and helpful.  Most spoke cómmendably good English."
3902,"Gentle slope to front door and totally level access throughout Though the front doors are heavy and might require bit of assistance. There is plenty of room between the tables to easily reach selected table. Large illustrated menu plus more fiddley paper ones to order using pencil, but waiter happily did this for us."
3903,"All on the flat, automatic doors throughout, except exiting the café. They have   a one way system in place.. As mentioned one side of the centre was quite narrow in places and tight . No seating available for a rest, and the café is quite a walk from the   entrance,although there are wheelchairs , a mobility scooter, and trolleys with incorporated seats at the entrance. Signage could have been better regarding the one way system in the café"
3904,"The star is because when I spoke to them about the toilets they were very apologetic, but it was a little too little, too late."
3905,Disabled toilet on site access a little bit tight but  possible
3906,Theatre where is accessible bar area and toilet
3907,Only really accessible by car.  No vehicles allowed on site but the neighbouring (cheap) Pay and Display car park has (only) 2 disabled spaces close to the mill.
3908,"The disabled toilet is in main entrance near Medequip through a medium weight door. All the toilets in the hospital are pretty much the same. Grey grab rails around toilet and sink. A lowered mirror and coat hook. 2-3 bins. Just enough turning space to turn although I feel many of them you'd struggle to fit in two people and a large wheelchair. 

There are no changing places toilets at Royal Derby. "
3909,"You can park right outside each of your designated cottage.
Scoresby cottage in particular has disabled facilities throughout"
3910,There is an underground carpark if you go round the back of the hotel that has disabled parking in it. It costs £6 per night and there are lifts that take you straight into the hotel.
3911,This is the site of the Sandakan Death Marches from WW2. The area has been constructed so that the vast majority is wheelchair accessible. You can get right up close to some of the terrifying machinery that was used. If you are ok with steps it is one big loop. If you prefer a step free route you walk half way then back on yourself but there are maps to show you this.
3912,Very friendly and helpful.
3913,"The loos were easy enough to find, good signage and spacious enough for me. "
3914,During lockdown walking to this establishment  was a ritual - they do  pastries to die for and coffee. This was fine but having the use of one hand takeaways can be a bit of a pain. So I was over the moon to discover they had knocked through to the shop next door to create a sitting area and an accessible loo!
3915,"I believe there is a disabled loo on the ground floor, however I didn't use it so can't provide any detail."
3916,I attended a concert here and I think the venue was excellent from reception at the tube station to dropping us back there. The access was fantastic and made the whole experience really enjoyable. 
3917,"As explained above, they’ve come up with wheelchair-friendly solutions which in no way detract from this historic building. The foyer and shop are spacious, and the first two lifts were a decent size. The one behind the panelling has to be small and quite narrow, with a 90 degree turn to get in, but there was room for both Wheelchair Girl and the Accompanist. There’s a small platform lift so that you can access the only area of the shop which is up stairs. The circulating spaces in the gallery are good and all doorways wide enough for a wheelchair. Signage is good and in English as well as Dutch, and on a level appropriate for a wheelchair user."
3918,Staff were helpful and knowledgable.
3919,"The disabled toilet is a good size, but there are highs chairs outside which need to be all moved out if you are to get past"
3920,"Large supermarket with lots of parking options, cafe and lift to shop floor."
3921,"Accessibility for the Ability Fest event was excellent. Right down to the signing of the speeches, live text display of the speakers presentations, good wheelchair access, and plenty of help on hand."
3922,"An adequate free disabled toilet, in a purpose-built block on the hill behind the Dreadnaught Hotel. Tidy, but a little grubby. Requires a Radar key for entry."
3923,"I went to see a musical during the Fringe at Pleasance Two, and had a great experience! Staff were friendly and helpful, and everything went smoothly. "
3924,"There is a button for a power assist door both going in and out, There is a simple one line queuing system as you enter the branch. There are only two teller positions in the branch. Both of these have hearing loop systems in place the branch is not that big and when sitting in a wheelchair at a teller point it does not leave a lot of room for people to pass. 
There is also an office area however there are Two steps up to this area which is likely to be used if you are looking for a loan or Mortgage etc."
3925,"We drove down from Pitlochry and there are 2 parking bays for the disabled outside the front door.
If you are travelling by bus, the bus stop from the north is just across the road and from the south, it is outside the bank next door."
3926,Disabled parking very close to main entrance to cinema
3927,You access through the front door but then are shown to the area.  The slope up to the area is quite steep. There is a disabled access toilet. 
3928,as previously
3929,"We had a lovely few days at Homelands. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming and we really enjoyed the peaceful setting.

The accommodation was beautiful and they had thought of every little detail to ensure that we needed for nothing. Everything is immaculately clean and the grounds are kept lovely. It was such great therapy to just sit and look out at the amazing views.  Thank you to everyone at Homelands"
3930,"The whole thing is on ground level. The door is a bit heavy, but the staff are always willing to help. They allowed us to choose where we wanted to sit. 
The food was made with reference to food intolerences. The disable toilet is directly opposite the way into the toilet area and had a side folding door. It didn't have a ""Changing Places"", but the toilet was clean, well laid out and the red cord was freely hanging to the floor.
The staff are always willing to help and the food is excellent. We love going there."
3931,"The nearest tube station is High Street Kensington, which is not at all step-free. Earl's Court tube station is about ¾ of a mile away and fully step-free. Kensington Olympia station, served by London Overground, is step-free and roughly the same distance away. Zillions of bus routes pass along Kensington High Street, very close to the entrance to Holland Park. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area. "
3932,Pals have been recommending the restaurant at Three Chimneys to me for yonks - and I was finally lucky enough to visit earlier this year... Yes it was worth the wait! There are a couple of small lips and a bit of gravel / uneven ground to get in but otherwise there is level access throughout. There was great ambiance with a bustling yet comfortable dining room - and a good accessible loo too! Will definitely be recommending...
3933,"All capable and willing, but not always as open as could be, but no problems with this."
3934,Everyone was very friendly and courteus.
3935,"It’s level throughout and very safe, wide open spaces makes it so easy to move around, no steps were encountered, plenty of seating areas, they have done a wonderful job of looking after the care of disabled, thank you.
As only reviewing the hotel with coffee break, we did not see bedrooms or if there’s a lift, but most rooms are on the ground floor anyway."
3936,"There is ample parking outside the shop, with bus services stopping southbound 25m away services 11, 15, 16, 23, 36 and 45 and also northbound, a pedestrian crossing is 35m from the northbound bus stop."
3937,"Everything had level access, electric doors at the entrance and three lifts.  I took half a point off as the doors to the rooms were impossible for me to open."
3938,"Accessible loo was lovely. Well decorated, plenty of space for me, wheelchair and PA. All very clean and well looked after. "
3939,"When I discovered there was a tapas bar nearish to me, I just had to try it. You see, I normally holiday in Spain once or twice a year but since lockdown had been unable to. "
3940,"Travelling with a wheelchair is a problem everywhere in Philippines, its possible but difficult due to lack organisation. Many suburb hotels only have rooms upstairs, and no escalators or lifts, staff will have to carry you. Many hotels only have shower cubicles, or baths this includes their ""disabled friendly rooms"".
Most local transport is on tricycles or jeepneys, there large or wheelchair bound will severe difficulty accessing. There are many taxis in Manila which advertise disabled, but the drivers are not trained. Access to buildings can also be a problem, they will have a steep ramp access, but then there are steps ????  stiff spring glass doors and these do not always have doormen.
Travel between cities is mainly by coaches, again getting off and on can be difficult though staff will help.
Most Local roads do not have pavements, so the roads have to be used, most roads are not in good repair, also many roads especially in towns are very busy. parking is very haphazard."
3941,The staff were  friendly and very helpful
3942,"The visitor centre shop is quite large, there is a low counter and it's easy to locate information and to look at the things on sale"
3943,Step free access to ground floor shop and café. The café has free standing tables and chairs. The shop and café is more spacious than it first looks from the front as it extends quite a way to the back. 
3944,Finding dancebase was easier than I thought. I'd been told to look for the narrow archway toward the end of the Grassmarket. I spotted the signage from a distance. Going inside you find a large lift (room for more than one wheelchair) that takes you up to reception. Push pad auto doors let you in and the reception counter is fab as it's at wheelchair height. Once in I could wheel around all areas and the lift was fine going up to the upper level. In the studio there was plenty of space and my viewing position at the front of the seated tier was fabulous. The cafe and other areas were great!
3945,Allocated bays at front entrance
3946,The accessible toilet in the Grand Circle is very close to the disabled seating and it was clean and very spacious with lots of grab bars and well signposted.  
3947,"Double-Gate Farm was such a find! This was our first time booking, we had a wonderful long weekend, and are already trying to work out when we can return.The welcome from Debbie on arrival set the tone really - warm, friendly, helpful. And with cake!!! We stayed in a Riverside Room as we needed wheelchair access and it was even better than we'd hoped. It's so tough finding places that are truly accessible and Double-Gate Farm has got it just right! It's such a joy to stay somewhere that has all of the adaptations we need but is still full of character and not in any way clinical. The room was spotless with probably the best equipped hospitality tray we've ever come across plus gorgeous complimentary toiletries. Splendid breakfasts cooked by Terry - that man can scramble a very fine egg! Location is great for exploring but also geared up for sitting and relaxing just outside the room on the lovely riverside patio if you want to stay around the farm. Great place and exceptional hosting. We'll definitely return!"
3948,All helpful.
3949,Clean and spacious.
3950,"Carluccio's is situated between Cambridge's Grand Arcade shopping centre and Fisher Square. There is accessible parking for blue badge holders in the Grand Arcade multi-storey car park, and limited on-street disabled parking bays nearby in the city centre. Most buses into Cambridge city centre are accessible; the nearest bus stops are situated at the other end of the Grand Arcade, on St Andrew's Street."
3951,"The Dior exhibition is on in the  Sainsbury Gallery and the nearest entrance is Exhibition Road. This is the entrance you will need to use if you visit the gallery outside the V and A's regular open hours. Exhibition Road has a step free entrance. This was the first time I had used this entrance and I found the step free pathway a little off putting. The surface is tiled. The tiles have a texture to them (see photo), however if the surface had been wet I would have found it difficult with my crutch to negotiate, especially as there is no hand rail to assist. When I was exiting in the dark I found it quite difficult to tell gradient of the slope as I got near to the exit. The tiles on the edges of the slope have obvious ridges in them  (see photo) which are helpful to mark the boundry of the path.
I entered the building using a manual door. There was a queue for the exhibition. There is a flight of stairs with hand rails down to the exhibition. I asked where I needed to go and I was directed to the lift and on exiting the lift, a member of staff opened the cord and let me join the queue, so I had not needed to join the main queue. 
The exhibition is popular and sold out. Entrance is by timed ticket. The exhibition is step free and is all on one level, with no ramps or slopes. There are 10 galleries ranging from large to small. However there were queues in most rooms to view the items. 
In some of the rooms there are only clothes to see and in others clothes plus cabinets with memorabilia. Some of the rooms have quite low level lighting. There were a couple of places where instead of information being on the cabinet there were large cards on the sides of the cabinet which I found a little difficult to carry with my crutch. In other places the information panels were too low down for me to read comfortably.
Wheelchairs are fold up stools are available but  I didn't notice them, so not obvious. There is no where to sit until the 5th gallery, look out for the Egyptian influnced clothes with a costume with the head of Anubis. When I got there I found the seating had no back support. This was the same in another gallery, it was only in second to last gallery that was seating with back support."
3952,This is a busy pet shop in Falkirk's town centre with fairly good access.
3953,A fairly new building with excellent provision for wheelchair users. The location is special and well worth a visit. There is a large car park with disabled bays. There is a ramped entrance with wide electric doors. The views through large windows are amazing. The disabled toilet is very good. The food and staff are also very good.
3954,Staff on the gate provided directions and guidance on best place to park and what to access from where.
3955,"The staff were so lovely and helpful, they were polite and I cannot fault the service"
3956,St Giles' Cathedral is located on Edinburgh's Royal Mile - right in the heart of the Old Town. There are many bus stops nearby. Not sure about Blue Badge parking nearby.
3957,"Large disabled toilet just of the large entrance hall, with plenty of room for a wheelchair . Grab rails at the basin. However, doubles as a baby changing area."
3958,Up the ramp at the visitors centre and round the back. Wasn't the smartest but pretty good.
3959,"There is an accessible toilet available which also doubles as a baby change. The toilet is opened by a radar key and swings outwards. The toilet has a grab rail attached to the wall on the left side and has a drop down rail on the right. There are also rails next to the sink. The toilet is a high toilet which helps with standing.  There is an alarm cord in the corner of the toilet. 
The score is knocked down because whilst the toilet itself was clean and any rubbish was contained in a bin, the floor of the toilet looked dirty and this makes the whole cubicle appear unsanitary. "
3960,"As a speech impaired wheelchair user asking questions, almost all of the elderly retired volunteers were slightly wary of me. However they quickly overcame that znd were very helpful and friendly. "
3961,"Arrived by taxi. No specific disabled parking avaiable, although on street parking is available nearby."
3962,"the staff were lovely and happy to help, they were friendly and happy to chat. they also asked attentively if we needed help and if they could offer or get us anything."
3963,Helpful if you asked  any questions.
3964,There are disabled parking spaces available in the Findhorn Foundation Car park but it is quite a trek from there to where this event was held up forestry tracks.  Findhorn Bay Arts did get permission for us to take our car nearer to the location but there was still a fairly bumpy forestry track to negotiate slowly.  There are buses and trains to Forres from Inverness and a local bus goes  past Findhorn Foundation.
3965,Spent the day in Luss on the banks of Loch Lomond. Met friends who also had a less abled boy and had a wonderful time following the faerie trail along the river and back into the new playpark across from the new well appointed carpark.
3966,"We took the bus from Rimini, 15 minute service from The town square, journey time 30 mins, 15 miles, excellent both ways, the stadium car park was large and spacious, all on one level. No access issues."
3967,"Large open doors to main entrance. Spacious lifts up to top floor where comedy club was. Plenty of room in comedy club its self.
Bar wasn't too busy and was also open and spacious. Got served easy enough.
Didn't use toilet facilities so couldn't comment."
3968,N/A. Staff did their job but nothing to write home about.
3969,"Full wheelchair accessible accommodation with friendly staff. 24 hour nursing care is also available and volunteer help on a one-to-one basis for washing, toileting and bathing facilities. Ensuite facilities in each bedroom. Full-board is provided. Daily trips organised to places of interest within the North-West area, taken out on adapted buses with lifts for the guests. Gives the opportunity for disabled people and people with disabilities to mix with able bodied volunteers from all walks of life and from other European countries also. Individuals are also taken out into the Southport seaside resort to enjoy the likes of shopping, eating out in various accessible restaurants and pubs and the town's amusements. People with varying disabilities are accommodated for at Sandpipers. The Sandpipers centre is based on the dunes facing the largest in land man-made lake in Great Britain. "
3970,"This is a cliff top garden and there are various routes to get to it. There are two step free route into the gardens both will involve going up steep slopes. From Peak Hill Road, there is a steady climb up from Sidmouth town centre to the step free entrance of the gardens. Using this route you will pass an entrance into the gardens with steps before you arrive at the step free entrance. The other way is via the sea front. From the town beach there is a path along to Jacob’s Ladder Beach, this is padestrianised. The ladder refers to a staircase that connects the beach to the gardens. There is also a steep slope with a hand rail which will take you up to Peak Hill Road and the gardens. I didn’t walk up but it’s my opinion that going up via Peak Hill Road would be slightly less steep.
Once in the garden it is mainly flat with some gentle slopes. Most of it is step free but these paths are not signposted. Where there are steps there’s usually two to four steps but they tend not to have a handrail. There are a couple of walled gardens and a quite a few nooks and crannies so although the gardens are popular you can easily find a quiet stop to rest. There’s plenty of benches to sit on. In one of the walled gardens is a clock tower and there is a café and cakery, see my separate review. In the garden is a cactus house and bandstand, where there are regular concerts during the summer season.
There are also some wonderful viewing terrace. One is overlooking Jacob’s Ladder Beach and over to the Salcombe Hills and another overlooking Lyme Bay, both step free. There is also a viewing point of Sidmouth beach and town, this had about four long steps down to it, which I think would be long enough to accommodate a wheelchair on each individual step. "
3971,Carer said staff were good
3972,Debbie and Helen helped me find the stores I was looking for
3973,"Four toilets available throughout Ty Glyn Davis Trust. One being ""super"" accessible. It has plenty of space for wheelchair users and carers. Grab rails and commode also provided if needed. "
3974,"I always drive as public transport is hit and miss. There are no concessions on the extortionate car park rates. The blue badge parking is on the same floor as staff parking and on one day (18/1/20) they had put barriers up across the entrance so disabled people could not use the blue badge area. We parked up a few floors, had to put my wheelchair together with cars driving past and the lifts are very difficult and tight for Powerchair/scooter users. "
3975,"Wheelchair accessible but no emergency red cord.
See photo."
3976,Tables very tight would struggle to manoeuvre a wheelchair. 
3977,"Outstanding accessibility, outstanding staff, outstanding food - top marks!"
3978,The main area is all on ground floor level with ramps in place. As it is a central pub / restaurant it can be busy with people. The chairs and tables can be moved to create space.
3979,The loos are big enough but like so many - obstructed internally by plastic bins. 
3980,The Bar had an open entrance at the side of the main doors to make easy access for customers using wheelchairs.  It was pretty spacious inside.
3981,All on the flat
3982,"The Hotel has a small car parking area for four vehicles. There is a single dedicated accessible parking bay. The bay has clear markings and provision has been made for sufficient space for a wheelchair user to be able to move alongside their vehicle to transfer. The parking space should be booked at the time of making the room reservation.

For those using public transport the street side options, only a few metres from the hotel’s front door, offer buses, tour buses and taxis or slightly further afield the tram network and of course the railway stations at Edinburgh Waverly and Haymarket."
3983,"All very helpful, especially in the restaurant."
3984,"easy access no steps 
clearly signposted
door wide enough"
3985,Access is not too bad but you may need assistance to open the double doors to get in.
3986,There is very limited parking around this area and restrictions are in place at certain times of the year. The nearest car park is about 10mins away however the trams do stop at the end of the pier
3987,"There is not a car park available for visiting The White Goose as it is located on a main road. However, with being in the city centre there are plenty of on street parking spaces and council car parks that are 5/10 minute walks away. I would suggest parking in the Gelty Street car park as it is the closet and lots of disabled parking spaces available.

It is a minimum of a 5 minute walk to the train station and there are plenty of bus stops going all over Dundee and Angus."
3988,There is parking available for an additional price. Limited amount of spots designated for people with disablilities.
3989,There are two kissing gates at the start and finish witch can be a bit tricky but the path is concrete most of the way just a little bit bumpy after the small wooden bridge
3990,"There are nearby bus stops & taxi ranks, but not accessible tube stations."
3991,This centre is next to the Ethiad so has good transport links with the tram. We came by minibus and there were disabled spaces right by the entrance
3992,The outlet had a specific 'blue badge' parking area. But finding a space within the other car parks can be difficult especially during peak times as the car parks can become very busy.
3993,A very accessible gardens and glasshouses. Good quality cafe with helpful staff. 
3994,Centrally located with huge coffee cups. Henry's Coffee House is a great place to relax in City Square. The coffee house has a step-free entrance and sheltered seating outside. 
3995,"The closest accessible toilets are to the east just past the children's sandy playground. The nearest Changing Room unfortunately is in Newport (8 + miles away). If you're trying to find accessible public toilets I recommend the 'Flush' app, it's saved me several times!"
3996,"Staff are welcoming and understanding. Very pleasant and engaging, disability is not an issue, just another customer requirement, you do not feel awkward, just welcome."
3997,"La Favorita is on Leith Walk so has plenty of bus stops nearby. We drove and whilst we didn't find any Blue Badge spaces nearby there is on street parking nearby. In addition the fabulous Manager suggested that we ""double"" park right outside the door and he would let us know if anyone needed to move."
3998,"Brilliant toilets, easily accessible."
3999,"Open shop front, plenty of space, accessible loo and friendly staff."
4000,Doorway were ample for the mobility scooter and it was easy to get round. The courtyard seating for the cafe was paved but even. The North Garden is a sunken garden accessible only via several steps so we were unable to explore it. Other areas were easily accessible - except the house (see above).
4001,"So if you find yourself in Switzerland, the city of Basel is a pretty cool city to be based in. The airport (Basel Mulhouse) is small and compact so easy access and Basel has one of the highest number of museums, galleries for such a small city. the Paper Mill, is still a working Mill and although it's in the original old house is fully accessible. There is a big lift to all 3 floors , although there are one or two side rooms where a wheelchair can't access but it is a house from circa 1400hundreds, I think. There are demonstrations for making your own paper, bookbinding, scribing, big printing presses. Something for everyone, kids can touch things, theirs noise, smells etc. right outside is a nice cafe overlooking the river Rhine, again fully accessible. I myself am not a wheelchair user, but I happen to stroll around the world and hope to find the odd locations that might just be tempting . I look out for lifts, ramps and accessible toilets. And easy transport to and from the location. This has the works. :-)"
4002,Have visited this cinema with my husband who is in wheelchair many many times.   Lovely Art Deco Independant cinema.    We always meet with friendly helpful staff who are more than happy to help.   We particularly like the live digitally broadcast theatre and opera productions .
4003,There's one loo at the back of the cafe & it's spacious with grab rails.
4004,Only a limited area is accessible from a wheelchair.
4005,The staff in the normal car park directed us to a disabled parking car park. Staff in the disabled parking area were very infomative & explained I could swap my manual wheelchair for a electric scooter to get around. My husband was very grateful !
4006,"Most supermarkets have reasonable disabled loos but this one was particularly good, The disabled loos had loads of space to get in and good facilities inside. In addition - and I haven't seen this before - in the general ladies loos section, one of the three cubicles had grip rails on the walls on either side of the loo itself and a large easy grip handle on both sides of the cubicle door.  Really usful for someone with some mobility issues but who doesn't feel the need to use the disabled loo.
The toilets were all sparkling clean. Well done Morrisons."
4007,"The shop has a ramp ready to deploy quickly for wheelchair users, but there is no access to the basement."
4008,"In regard to the café it is all level access and entrance into Discovery Point is level entrance with pad operated automatic doors which open inside so no issue with door hitting your chair if your too close. 

Café was spacious inside and seating areas were easily accessible with tables at reasonable height for wheelchairs. 

I haven't been to the museum since I was a child but within the main museum I don't remember there being an issue with me getting anywhere. Of course the ship itself was built in 1901 so when I was last on it I can't remember if I managed to get my chair aboard, but if I could I didn't get very far and definitely couldn't get below deck. "
4009,All toilets are fully functional for all people as none up stairs
4010,"Heavy double doors to gain access, but there is glass so people can see if you are waiting at the door.  Would benefit from a doorbell.  Staff are friendly and extremely helpful.  There is an accessible toilet and everything is on one level."
4011,Accessible toilet in a very remote part of the Isle of Mull.
4012,The place has ample disabled car parking and is also on a bus route so is a very convenient place to visit.
4013,"Amazingly good. In a word or two - the provision of the Changing Places Toilet is a deal breaker for so many people! If you're not too sure what this is .... It's a toilet which has more space than an average accessible loo so there's room for carers and personal assistants. It has an adult changing bench, a hoist, a loo, a sink, a privacy screen, and a welcome feeling!

Along side the Changing Places unit there is an accessible loo with powered door which is handy. On the George Street site you will find another accessible loo.

If you are looking for baby changing facilties; the site has these as well tucked in the far corner. Please don't use the Changing Places Toilet for baby changing unless you have access requirements. That was my only concern as I had to wait to use the C P Loo as it was occupied with by a mother changing a baby. Note to Festival Organisers - perhaps a sign on the C P door explaining what it is and also directing parents looking for baby changing facilties to those facilties."
4014,Accessible loo is through a door at the back and on right hand side. Inside there is a level mirror and space for chair and carer. The baby change tray has braille. Red cord is to left of the toilet and reaches the floor.
4015,Staff were very helpful.
4016,I really can't thank Ann and Gordon enough for their fabulous hospitality. They were very welcoming yet very private also. Nothing was too much trouble and they certainly went out of their way to make our stay wonderful. 
4017,"Having had to change plans re hubbies health this was an ideal setting, time to relax by the river, enjoy local attractions and make use of  local food and amenities. Site Manager Clayre  was so helpful and cheerful and we look forward to going back next year."
4018,"Step free navigation to majority of the park (only steps I noticed was for accessing some adventure walkways and tracks that with mobility issues I wouldn’t attempt anyway).

There were seating areas scattered about the park. 

Free mobility scooter snd wheelchair loan.  Recommended that you phone in advance to reserve as there is a limited amount available. 

No alternative formats to the signage, maps, menus. 

No lowered areas for those in chairs or reserved areas for those with mobility difficulties.  No quiet area. "
4019,"The toilet is almost as big as my bedroom!  Plenty space to manoeuvre, toilet is a good height and has plenty handrails (red cord is down to the floor).  Shower has a flip down seat and lowered shower head.  Only thing that lets it down is lack of changing table and hoist."
4020,The rest of the restaurant is great for access and the waiting staff let me sit wherever I want and store my powerchair.
4021,There is a ramp up to the front door and a small step over into the door.  Moving around the lounge was a little tight but Ann told us she is looking at putting different chairs in there.  Ann is disabled herself so very much aware of our feelings.  Bedroom was good to get around.  The 2 single bedroom is a large room with plenty of space.  The bathroom has a grab rail at the toilet.  Ann arranged for a shower step for me to get into the shower.
4022,Really enjoyed our meander around St James Park - level access throughout - decent paths - a great spot to chill! You can even hire deckchairs on sunny days!!
4023,"Access to foyer is available at right hand side of the entrance. This may be closed and difficult to open if alone but at certain times, staff are on site who are able to help. From the foyer a small lift accesses floors 1 and 3. 1 is very spacious with a low ramp to more seating and a bar area. Floor 3 is a balcony style floor with less space but still room for seating."
4024,Very helpful and will always remove two seats for you do you have loads of room.
4025,The staff were exceptionally helpful and have been on every visit.   Alessandro introduced himself on my arrival having been alerted through Welcome App  that I had arrived  He found me a table and organised my requirements.   Everyone is very friendly and it is always an enjoyable experience.  In the Monboddo lounge they were attentive to my requests couldn’t fault them.
4026,"Very helpful, we were made to feel really welcome."
4027,The poolside has level access as do the bars and restaurants all the pools are walk in so it's easy to be wheeled in on the chairs provided the water slides don't have access if you cannot weight bare because they have steps but the wave pool and water fountain are are accessible
4028,EASY BY TAXI. SINGLE YELLOW LINES ALLOW PARKING WITH BLUE BADGE
4029,"Level access, widened doors and bathroom was wonderful."
4030,Extremely good.
4031,"For a historical building, visitor attraction and fully functioning Church this a delight to visit. As I am profoundly VI, I contacted York Minster about visiting, I was passed to a member of their Visitor Services Team who  explained everything they could about a VI person visiting the Minster.  The time, explanation and details taken and given were exceptional. I stated I was arriving by train and booked me a slot to coincide for my tour with my arrival and departure, as they could see me approaching the main entrance I was warmly welcomed and assisted through the entrance bypassing the queue that was there. I was introduced to my guide who had a B, VI, and PS pack available  - I had already asked for the ordinary tour the a B, PS, VI tour to  fully appreciate and note the differences. Although there was a charge of      £10.00 the concession price was £9.00. Both tours were tremendously well    done, the guide used her skills of clear explanations and the touch sensory  aspects match brilliantly which contributed to a visualisation of what was around me. Wood carvings, masonry, marbles and the windows that were out of sight , touch and reach were supplemented by  3 D touch floor   building and plan with a Braille explanation and electronic pen that was a audio guide that told of what the pen touch on all in a A4 size folder and bag with touch directions for each solid board of the book that made up the guide. There are also full explanations on the tracery and windows for anyone to use in computer screen form with a zoom in and out with a detailed explanation.. There is an extensive, accessible shop that covers the fabric, widows and masonry of the Minster it is well throughout and is not cluttered and difficult to navigate round."
4032,"Ramp into the conservatory- not too steep, doorway has a large bump to get over and opening was obstructed by chairs which we had to move ourselves to get in and out. There are about 12 steps up to the function rooms and then another few steps. I had to get lifted up and down the stairs by friends and my wheelchair carried up separately- not ideal at all but this was for an important event. Floors are carpet  "
4033,"Everything was on the ground floor.  The layout itself is not ideal for wheelchair access but the staff do their best to help, offering to move tables, open doors etc. and were friendly and welcoming."
4034,Valley View (M3 rated - 2 people) is all on one level and has a extremely spacious kitchen bathroom and bedroom. Living room is good size. All doorways are extra wide. Wheelchair user found no problems. If Brambles Barn is taken as well (4 guests) it gives an superb combination of spaces.
4035,"Parking near the venue may be difficult but there is on street Parking. As it is on a hill, it may, if possible, be best to get dropped off outside the venue. There are some buses that pass by but did not note which numbers."
4036,"We reached the Collective by travelling up the road up Carlton Hill, it was steep in places and I was glad we didn't meet a car travelling in the opposite direction. Once we arrived we went straight to the Collective as it was the first time I had been up Carlton Hill since it has opened. It was great to see the buildings in use again and I plan to return when the exhibitions change."
4037,"If just visiting, say for dinner, or to admire the old historical building, you can cope and see most of the hotel, but the gardens and terrace would have to be missed.

We have offered two other reviews for Nutfield Priory, which will give you our full advice and thoughts, so do read these please before making your mind up about this hotel and Priory. "
4038,"Lots of the upstairs of the house is inaccessible, and it is not easy to get into the mostly accessible but lovely gardens - you have to ask the staff to let you in a side gate and they are not always easy to find or nearby - I had to abandon the wheelchair user by the gate to try and find someone to let us out. The cafe is accessible and very welcoming with very nice homemade cakes and scones and soups."
4039,"The hotel does have the benefit of an underground car park. Disabled guests can arrange to use this by contacting the hotel in advance of their stay.

Lauriston Place is served by several Lothian bus services; all of which have wheelchair access."
4040,Big accessible loo which is now on the ground floor.
4041,no disabled access
4042,"The escort is much needed because it does not mean pushing your way through troublesome Millwall fans, albeit the stewards and seemingly endless line of police weren't ever so welcoming! The staff in the stadium did not think to bring us refreshments, instead of making us go inside to get them. Yet since our visit, my uncle has spoken to them kindly and they have since started taking drinks to the seats; hopefully that continues in the 2016/17 season!"
4043,"Used the Tram a couple of days in a row, parking at Ingliston Park & Ride. Where there are plenty of disabled parking bays.  This was a very easy experience (using mobility scooter), though you do need a permit to take the scooter on.  You can arrange one here:

https://edinburghtrams.com/about-trams/tram-access

At the tram stops the tram is level with the 'platform' so very easy to enter and exit.

The only issue was the Edinburgh bound ticket machine gets the sun in the morning so hard to see! 
"
4044,The staff are always pleasant and helpful
4045,"It is a very famous golf course which holds major championships, with three golf courses.  The hotel is reached through the impressive looking gates (photo 1).
There are 11 disabled bays (photo 2) reasonably close to hotel entrance (photo 3). 
Automatic sliding doors to enter the hotel (photo 4) all on the level.
The reception area is very busy, full of activity, (photo 5)  but it’s not a very big area but it has its own character.
The Bar and lounge is very large (photo 6) very appealing to sit and enjoy a drink or bar meal. (photo 7). It’s very popular and has a lot of atmosphere, and there was plenty of room for wheelchair, while we had a coffee break.
The main hub of the hotel is spacious , (photo 8)  with everything we needed to see leading off it in one direction or another. Marbled tiled floor, so easy to move across.
Over to the left of hub, was a double door leading into restaurant. (photo 9).  Our next photo shows one of the small intimate areas comprising a part of the restaurant, (photo 10) with plenty of room to move about. Another more secluded area, again on the level (photo 11) and on tiled flooring, and this little place gives for more intimacy. There is also a larger area (photo 12) where more seating awaits you 
and is ideal for larger family groups.
In the centre of the Hub we see automatic doors (photo 13) which led out onto the terrace gardens. Plenty of seats on the terrace, comfortable rattan furniture, and is on a slabbed flooring, for easy wheelchair movement (photo 14), a very pleasant place to sit and look out over the gardens and the fairways. (photo 15).
To the right of Hub, a very long passageway, (photo 16) and a ramp, led to the separate ladies and gents toilet, but no disabled toilet. (photo 17). To enter the toilets are two push doors, (photo 18) so wheelchairs had to be left out along passage, (photo 19), and then a very small toilet cubicle. (photo 20) Opposite was the 
very small lift which would take you to the bedrooms.

Our final thoughts
It’s a lovely, lively hotel, with plenty of atmosphere, but maybe a little to busy for a disabled person, who may feel they are in the way, but we really enjoyed our visit. However, if you like a lively atmosphere and are willing to accept a long walk to facilities, then you would enjoy this hotel.

"
4046,Disabled access to enter was fine but you would require someone to hold the door for you
4047,Usual city parking but ample on street parking close by. 
4048,The accessible toilet was great once you got in the room. Therein lies the problem - getting in - a very very tight 90 degree turn in a small corridor is required. I have a small chair and struggled. So much to I decided not to revisit it again.
4049,"We visited with a manual wheelchair and found it pretty much as per the description. There is nowhere to park - or even drop off - at the museum.  Public car parks nearby by up and down steepish slopes. Helpful staff. Carer admitted free. If you don’t want to visit the museum itself, there’s free access to the gift shop and nice cafe (via lift). "
4050,Flat paved courtyard area. Hand rail to front door and low thresholds.
4051,"The visitor centre is a purpose-built modern complex which was easily accessible. It had an automatic door at the main entrance, other automatic doors at key points and was easy to wheel around the bright spacious and light area. We enjoyed visiting the exhibition area which is full of exhibits and curios from burns life. It was a little dark in places but we understand this is to preserve the exhibits.

The shop and ticket area were easy to access with plenty of space to move around and easy to see things.  The Cafe was busy but again was easily accessible with plenty of staff on hand to lend a hand.

Burns cottage being an historical site was a little more challenging for me as a wheelchair user. That said, I was able to get into the cottage and wheel through the rooms, albeit a traditional stone flagged floor in places, and see everything that I wanted to. The adjacent gardens were also fairly accessible. The path from the cottage car park up to the gardens and cottage however was much more challenging with a rough gravel chipping style of surface which wheeling difficult. "
4052,"Thoroughly loved my day out with my colleague to Conisbrough Castle. All the staff were so lovely to us and really helpful, they went out of their way to make sure that not only my colleague and I but the class of school children and the staff members had a good day!"
4053,"Having heard about the coloured water fountains at Smart city before our visit to Malta, we decided that it would be nice to visit. We proceeded to have an enjoyable 90 minutes watching the coloured water fountains change in time to the background music, with a large number of formations and colours. 
There are good vantage at Smart City  to watch the fountains, as well as having a nice stroll around Laguna Walk which has 360 degree views of the fountains.
A very enjoyable and relaxing way to spend time of an evening."
4054,"Car park currently restricted because of building work in adjacent building.
Local road parking can be difficult during day times.
Bridge of Allan has good links by road and rail. Railway station about half mile away. Bus stops within 100 yards."
4055,Owners live on the site and couldn't be more helpful .
4056,"It is a very big car park at this Costa Coffee on the Kingsway because it is located within a retail park. There are plenty of accessible parking beside the pathways of the retail, with parent and child parking also available. Lots of standard parking spaces are also available however, it would be difficult to cross over due to no pathways being near these spaces. Beside the accessible parking spaces there aren’t always a dipped kerb, so you might need to drive on the road to get to one.

You can get a bus from the city centre to the Kingsway retail park and there is plenty of room to be dropped off by taxi. I’m not 100% sure about the public transport though because I always drive my car here."
4057,"No steps, easily accessible."
4058,Parking directly outside the venue
4059,The building had a car park which was located in John Lewis store however it cost £25 floor 24 hours which could be extensive if you are living of benefits. It is located a 5 minute walk away from Buchanan bus station which offers easy access of and on the buses.
4060,"Staff were very helpful and knowledgeable gave a good account of life in the iron age, explained things slowly and clearly."
4061,The staff were all amazing and super helpful. They were always more than happy to help and very friendly. The kitchen staff were also very accommodating and happy to make meals for my dietary requirements. I couldn't fault the service at all. 
4062,"No one particularly helpful, it was clearly obvious I was disabled but no attempt was made to let me know about any disabled facilities"
4063,Toilets are accessible. They are not massive but enough room for a powerchair.  They don't have a radar lock so unfortunately everyone can use them which of course means they are easily abused by people who would rather not queue for the ladies/gents.
4064,The attraction is completely wheelchair friendly and on one level. Guide dogs are also permitted. Staff are happy to help in any way they can.  Audio tours are available whichbis fantastic for anyone who has difficulty reading.
4065,"Walking on Air is a charity, volunteer run organisation which enables disabled people to experience a flight in a specially adapted glider  which has hand controls.

The portmoak gliding clubhouse has disabled parking, ramped access  easy access doorways, canteen, and fully accessible toilets.


"
4066,Most of the site is accessible although there is a fairly steep hill to the children’s park. Some paths are a little muddy after wet weather but there wasn’t anywhere I couldn’t access.
4067,"Rather poor, i went upstairs to counter but about 10 people waiting for a seat and was told i could only have a take-away"
4068,"Getting in is OK but they have baskets around that make it awkward, items are out of reach and there is a lack of staff to help"
4069,Owners were on holiday and friends were looking after the place.
4070,it is easy to access and available wheelchairs to borrow.
4071,"We parked in the Mercat centre shopping car park. 
Not sure about public transport."
4072,"The accessible loo was quite awkward to get into as there is a 90 degree turn to negotiate to get in. The toilet itself is adequate but once a powered wheelchair is in, there's not much space."
4073,For our group it was great as we didn't have any wheelchair users. It is a decent walk from the tearoom to the field where they have the flying demonstrations
4074,What a pleasure to be able to report on a perfectly designed and laid-out accessible toilet! Full marks!
4075,"Really good, most of the garden is accessible as is the restaurant and shop.  A lovely day out"
4076,Plenty of accessible parking next to the main entrance and a good bus service that stops almost at the door.
4077,Apart from the massive step the rest of the shop is flat and spacious.
4078,Being in the open air the stalls are easy to get to and it's easy to see the produce on offer.
4079,It has its own big car park that has disabled spaces very close to the entrance.
4080,Clean tidy and a decent size.
4081,I travelled from the airport to the hotel by taxi which was provided by Tui. 
4082,The accessible loo is in the ground floor bedroom reserved for disabled guests.  It has a folding rail - space in the bathroom is a bit tight.  Everything was super clean
4083,M+S in the middle of town but is adjacent to main road therefore drop off points there but no room for nearby parking
4084,parking was near the entrance as you'd expect
4085,"There are some renovations on the outside at the moment,so scaffolding can make it difficult to notice the signage. There are 2 entrances but it is only the entrance on Ingram street that is wheelchair accessible. The side entrance has a few steps to negotiate once inside."
4086,Lovely. Friendly. 
4087,Staff were very helpful 
4088,Great station for access with ramps to the main entrance and lift to the platform. Staff were very helpful in pointing out the way.
4089,The venue has very good disability parking well marked plenty of space as I drive myself there with a large Mercedes Sprinter van. It is also on a bus route as I know other friends go there with wheelchairs on the bus.
4090,"Good access, excellent staff!"
4091,"Great! There are two sets of doors, both step free and they are large wide doors. Tables are laid out in a spacious manner. Both tables and chairs can be moved around."
4092,"There were good lifts and ramps, and I was able to visit all the parts of the museum that I and my family wanted to see, including the aquarium and the Amazonian flooded forest. I was also able to reach the ""hands on"" science experiment exhibits from my scooter."
4093,The large wet room is over 4m2 which enabled us to bring the shower seat that we needed to use - just what we needed.
4094,Lift available
4095,We had a great day out here. It is a beautiful place and not as crowded as Windemere which suited our group. The staff were friendly and helped us by putting ramps down so we could get on and off the boat safely. For people living with dementia this is a great excursion and no problems with accessibility.
4096,We used wheelchair access taxis and a travel Counsellor to arrange our airport needs.
4097,My hotel was rolling distance from the stadium but there are public transport options available if you are further away including the Metro (5 mins wheel away from ground) or you could also get a taxi. Not sure of any parking availability. 
4098,Good level of Access 
4099,Being quite remote it is best to use your own transport to get there. If you do want to go by public transport there is a busy service running out of Inverness that will take you to the site. If you come by car then heading in to the car park there are loads of yellow lined accessible parking bays handily close to the entrance.
4100,"Food is very reasonable, with plenty of options to suit everyone. 

Staff were friendly and quick to identify tables with best wheelchair access.  "
4101,"We visited for the current exhibition Mid-century Modern, an exhibition about mid-twentieth century design, with an emphasis on Mary Quant. There was easy access via the door in Infirmary st, and it was possible to have level access around the exhibition. We also took the lift to the viewing gallery to watch the weavers below, really very interesting. There were several other small displays here too. Masks were worn, numbers limited due to booking being necessary. "
4102,Automatic doors big wide spaces it is amazing lift to second floor
4103,Doors are automatic. Level access. Counter wasn't lowered. Aisles are wide enough to turn around. 
4104,"As a wheelchair user I really have to compliment the owners of this superb classic car collection.  The set up made getting about so easy, especially with the way the cars were displayed.  There was adequate room for a wheelchair user to get up close enough to look through the windows and get detail of the cars.
There is a lift down to one level then a platform lifts to the next. The turnstiles are wheelchair accessible as well as an accessible toilet.  There is also a souvenir shop as well as a 
Café."
4105,Flat access into the building with lifts to all floors
4106,"There is a big step at the entrance. When staff saw me outside, they conferred briefly and without me having to ask they brought a fine, lightweight, portable aluminium ramp, fully fit-for-purpose, and I was easily able to enter the shop, which is a split-level structure on the ground floor, with a large ramped area leading to the slightly higher level, all of it easily accessible by wheelchair users. One small caveat: beware of the sudden drop in floor level, a kind of cliff on the large ramped area, where the clothes racks are, it would be possible to fall down it if you got too close to the edge."
4107,"If you are in a wheelchair, then furniture needs to be moved to access the toilet. Great pity really. It was the only downside. Otherwise it was well thought out."
4108,Very helpful and gave me a few extra towels for my wheelchair
4109,"Dawlish Railway Station has step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station. There are also local, step free buses serve the town."
4110,You can park in the high st car park but there are no wide spaces.   However it is free for blue badge holders .The High Street itself as a disabled bay right outside the restaurant but if you are a rear ramp user like I am you'll find it difficult to get the ramp down and onto the pavement
4111,Large well designed loos with grab rails and plenty of space. We have always found them to be clean and well maintained with clear signage
4112,"Beach wheelchairs always need someone with you who has a bit of muscle, but there wasn't far to go from our parking place to get out on the beach. When I later took my small scooter up to Sammy's cafe and shop, I thought at first I wouldn't be able to get to the cafe because there was at least one big step up, but it turned out there was a way in through the shop. I certainly couldn't get up the step to the open-sided marquee where everyone was eating due to Covid rules, but the staff took pity on me and my family and set up a table for us just inside in a well-ventilated place near an open door."
4113,"I visited with my family and my rollator / wheelchair (convertible). 

The ticket office is in the car park and the attendant there saw my mobility aid and told us he was phoning through to the house to ask them to help me / reserve a wheelchair. Whilst this was very proactive and well intended, it would’ve been nice to have been asked my specific access needs and preferences. We were told at this stage that my rollator would not be allowed in the house and I would have to use a wheelchair. 

Level access into the house is via the gift shop. A friendly member of staff opened the other half of the door to let me in (door is otherwise narrow). She apologised profusely that my rollator couldn’t enter the house - it’s not a size issue, but the house owner is concerned about wheels bringing dirt onto floor coverings. I would argue that shoes, walking sticks, etc are just as likely to bring in dirt, so perhaps this is a little misguided… And the manual wheelchairs offered won’t be suitable for everyone’s needs. But this is a private home and I recognise the need to be a good guest. 

After declining use of a supplied manual wheelchair (3 available) , I opted to walk around slowly using my walking stick (so that I could move around under my own steam and look at things) . The staff were more than happy to look after my folded rollator in the shop, even though I offered to park it outside. I walked up about 8 steps (with bannister left & right handed) then was escorted by staff to the official entrance point / start of route around house. This did mean walking about 30-40% further to complete the tour of the house. 

House staff were very helpful and there were chairs dotted around to rest on, though not in every room. 

There is one audio visual room with a short film playing - lots of seating here and room for wheelchairs, but the sudden change in lighting levels may disorientate some. The sound of film was loud enough for me with mild-moderate hearing loss. 

To access the cafe with my rollator there is a level entrance round the corner of the building from shop door, down a tarmac slope. Along the internal corridor to the cafe is a very clean disabled toilet with plenty of space and good lighting. Inside the cafe, the tables and chairs are fairly close together, so a little difficult to navigate. I chose to sit on my rollator at a table, to be space efficient - there wasn’t really space to park it.  There are two outdoor seating areas with more space around the tables. 

Two out of three garden walk routes are marked as accessible. We found the paths were mostly flat, very close mown grass with decent drainage, or well trampled down gravel - fine for my aid in both rollator and manual wheelchair mode. The arboretum seemed to have some paths with loose gravel and more undulating surfaces. I opted not to try entering the maze, as it had a thick gravel surface and looked narrow for my mobility aid (no room for people to pass me). There are several benches in this area, but we didn’t see many seats elsewhere in the gardens. "
4114,"Rancho Grande is a sea front restaurant, serving a wide variety of food. It also offers take away cakes and there is also a small shop area selling food such as biscuits, etc which would make nice gifts. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. The ground floor is step free."
4115,Flat access throughout accommodation including onto large terrace from 2 patio doors
4116,staff were friendly & helpful & brought our order to the table.
4117,The staff we came across were more than happy to help in whatever way they could. 
4118,"Although I did not use them, there was an accessible toilet at the entrance.  the entrance to wich was flat and the signage was clear."
4119,"There were generally plenty of accessible loos, of varying standards.  Most were usable but generally of a slightly lower standard than expected in the UK."
4120,"Level access entrance through reception and the shop. You enter a warm and inviting cafe with a great selection of simple yet tasty food - and good value too! While you're eating there is lots to watch! It is the National Climbing Centre with lots of indoor climbing walls and has the World's biggest ice climbing wall - and you can see all the activity from the cafe. 

There are accessible climbing sessions that are run at the centre - I didn't get a chance to find out more (too busy having lunch!) but will definitely get in touch if I'm due to be in the area again and get a session booked."
4121,The building itself was great. Automatic doors open to let you in the foyer where there is a reception counter. The signage was good and a large lift takes you to the various floors. There was plenty of circulation space and not tight corners or tricky manoeuvres to be deployed.
4122,"Excellent access and facilities inside the gallery, but parking can be difficult and tricky to find if you don't know where to go."
4123,Staff at the Kinema are very friendly and are happy to help with any enquiries or problems regarding access to the building.
4124,Toilet accessible. clean
4125,This visit was arranged in advance using WelcomeByNeatebox.  The Greeter knew I was coming and what I needed to do and organised seating accordingly.  Other staff approached me knowing my name and were helpful and friendly.
4126,"Staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful. When I went in for my CT scan, which I have every six months, they listened to me and aided me as requested regarding helping me get up safely and with dignity after lying down for the procedure. 

Afterwards I spoke to with Claudia on reception, she was very helpful when I raised the issue of accessible toilet signage. "
4127,"The ship is accessible to wheelchairs, but sadly not power chairs, blind, amputees etc etc.
Once you get a rope tied onto your chair up and pulled onto the ships deck there is lifts to all the decks. I was assigned an assistant to help me if I needed."
4128,There is parking available at the ground and in the streets around the stadium its self so you should not have to far to go. There is also a Taxi Rank just out side the gates of the stadium and a local tour bus that runs from the Albert Dock area stops just out side the gates a number of local buses also stop next to or near the stadium 
4129,Good access including to boats
4130,"Great. Could move around. Specific to disabled people (not a dual baby changing area)
Only 4.5 points as had to wait for 15 minutes whilst an abled father & little boy finished using the Disabled Toilet. Suggested they put a sign on door stating if you not disabled us the door to your left hand side."
4131,Good parking but no disabled bays
4132,"We drove to Barn at Beal. There is a good sized carpark with several disabled parking bays which are situated just beside the ramp to access the building.
"
4133,"We went for the most amazing meal lasr night at Simpson's. The food is divine. He really should have more than one star. To get in, there is a ramp and 2 disabled parking spaces round the back. The disabled toilet is sporlessly clean, well appointed by reception and with plenty of bars. The staff could not have been more helpful. They put a ramp down into the restaurant spacem but were very quick with it so I did not have to wait. All in all, a very positive experience. Strongly recommend"
4134,There are no dedicated parking bays for disabled visitors.
4135,Wheelchair accessible throughout most of the garden centre and restaurant.
4136,Great spacious accessible toilets in room and next to the bar/restaurant area.
4137,15 blue badge parking spaces but mainly taken by parents taking their kids to swimming and the management don't do anything about it.
4138,Really poorly sign posted. We had to ask several people before we found the disabled loos tucked overly discretely behind a screen in the cafe area. The toilet we used was very tight for a wheelchair user and companion. There were grab rails and an alarm. However the door lock and paper towel dispenser were both difficult to use.
4139,"Harlow Carr Gardens in Harrogate, is a tranquil experience, full of natural beauty. The gardens are set in 58 acres of amazing landscaped gardens. The visit to these wonderful gardens is enriching and relaxing and a highly recommended day out.  The specially designed suitable paths provided are ideal for wheelchair accessibility, and push chairs. There is free car parking available all year round, with excellent accessible parking close to the front entrance for disabled visitors, and parent parking bays.  There is a gentle sloped access ramp from the road crossing down to the main entrance of Harlow Carr Gardens. The entrance to the gardens is via the admissions area though automatic doors. There are toilets within the main building and other several other toilets in the gardens including accessible toilets that will accommodate wheelchair users.   There is plenty of seating available in and around the gardens at various heights and all have arm rests. This gives visitors the chance to rest whilst enjoying the gardens. The seasonal blooms offer a fragrant scent as you explore. Harlow Carr has wheelchairs and mobility scooters available to hire from the main entrance, booking ahead is always advisable, however visitors can also bring their own. Registered assistance dogs are also permitted in the grounds, shop and the famous Betty's tearoom. Portable induction loops are also available for visitors on request.  Not all the garden is accessible for wheelchairs, however there is a suggested route for mobility scooters/and wheelchairs to follow.  there are exhibitions in the Old Bath House throughout the year. there is also the Bramall learning centre, this has a fully accessible lift, library and toilets.  The staff are friendly and extremely helpful and they help to ensure you have a great day out. Enjoy a cup of Betty’s Yorkshire tea in this magical setting!"
4140,"I travelled by public transport. The nearest tube is Piccadilly Circus or Charing Cross, which both have poor disabled access. There are many buses that stop near by, in Piccadilly or Trafalgar Square, and then it is a few minutes walk. I travelled to Trafalgar Square on the bus and then it was a flat 5 - 10 minute walk to the Royal Society, and I think this may be the best option for people with mobility difficulties, as Piccadilly is up/ down a hill."
4141,"All nice, carried my drink to my table. When I asked for the code they just told me the number whereas I would’ve preferred it written down incase I forgot - which I did 😂"
4142,The bouncers and staff seem like a sound bunch here.
4143,Good disabled toilet. Large. 
4144,"There are disabled parking bays in all the venues, with easy enough access to the places of interest, the only slight concern is the low small step up into the entrance for FAWSLEY HALL HOTEL, but we coped very easily with that."
4145,"Level access of lifts to all screens. This cinema a has a D-BOX screen (the  seats move and vibrate throughout the film). These seats are at the rear of the screen. However two of these seats have been placed nearer  to the front so that they can be accessed without the use of stairs.
The two seats are separate from the other rows, meaning there is plenty of room for a wheelchair. The only down side would be that in some of the screen the front row is low and a little too close to the screen. The front row would have to be used in order to avoid stairs."
4146,"I love this place but in terms of accessibility it could do a lot better. Firstly they do not offer free PA tickets although they will discount two tickets down to the lowest price. Secondly there are a lot of steps as it is an old building and although there is a lift this gets busy so longs waits can occur. On the ground floor there is seating near the lift which helps. The other thing I find frustrating is that in an effort to be more accessible they labeled all their accessible toilets gender neutral and because of there situation everyone uses them again meaning long waits. There are also a lot of clutter in them in the form of extra bins. There is a lowered section to the main bar but not the cloakroom refreshment area. There are two performance spaces both have areas which can accept wheelchairs but these must be booked in advance. Level access to the lower seats in the round can be arranged through back stage. 
On the whole the staff are extremely helpful. "
4147,Both male and female toilets are downstairs and I do not think there is a disabled toilet on the ground level which is not useful to anyone in a wheelchair.
4148,Very supportive
4149,"There is a step to get into the saloon but with help from my husband and the owner I manage . The staff are always have to assist, I sit in my wheelchair while my hair is cut etc, and there is room for my wheelchair . They just move the chairs they would normally use to one side. I can even stay in my wheelchair when getting my hair washed as the back of my chair folds down, my hairdresser just pushes me over to the sink. "
4150,"There are 3 parking spaces outside of the gym, they aren't disabled parking spaces but if you exit from the back of your vehicle it would be okay. The owner said to me if my beautician mentions to her that I am coming she will put a cone out so there is a space available for me.

I'm not from this area so I don't know much about the public transport but the beauticians is located on the main street of Invergowrie so I think there will be bus stops nearby."
4151,Our ensuite bathroom and loo were spacious. A shower chair is provided and there is a wheelchair accessible wetroom shower. The accompanist enjoyed the man-sized bath tub. The loo is equipped with a grab rail. Side transfer from one side is possible. The washbasin is approachable in a wheelchair.
4152,"Overall, the access was good and signage was clear. There were a few sections with loose stone which may make it a bit challenging for some wheelchair users."
4153,"A very accessible gym that I am a member of. The gym is located at Perth College UHI. Public membership is £25 a month with significant discounts for students. A timetable of various fitness classes run every week and all classes are free to members. 

"
4154,Martin (the property owner) visited a couple of times and ensured that are needs were best met with whatever he could reasonably do.
4155,"Fully accessible with lifts, changing places loo on ground floor as part of main toilet provision."
4156,"There is 1 accessible loo which was well planned, spacious and very clean.  There was a grab rail and space for a carer.  No Changing Places Toilets."
4157,"Excellent. Spacious, well-equipped with grab rails. Side transfer from either side of the loo is possible and the toilet roll holder is within easy reach. There’s an "
4158,There was plenty toilets 
4159,"I'm assuming you mean the inside of the venue, and that is certainly accessible with lifts to all floors and easy accessible toilets."
4160,Front doors and main paths all the way. Large lift in the Link building (between the biomes). The rear carriage of the Land Train can accommodate wheelchairs with minimum fuss. There are only a couple of no-go zones (eg the observation platform at the very top of the Rainforest).
4161,Main entrance has electric sliding doors and a lift to rooms. 
4162,"As I'm sure you can imagine a facility run by Sense Scotland is very accessible. A lot of disability organizations use this place for obvious reasons.
"
4163,"Slope down towards the beach for ramped access or via step flight of stairs st the opposite side.
Allocated disability parking spaces on this ramp. 
If using public transport, the Metro has a station at Tynemouth and Cullercoats.
www.nexus.org.uk/nexus/metro for further information."
4164,"As a bus user there is more than adequate services within the current service restrictions, the services are 11, 16, and 101, these service are all chassis drop, with ramp and double door one at the front, the exit in the middle.You are permitted to exit the front door to exit using the chassis drop. The bus stops southbound 75 meters, northbound 40 meters from the store. There are audio and blind crossing on the road crossings all 20 meters from store."
4165,"Beautiful, clean and completely luxurious. I think the signage to the toilets could be improved however. It's difficult to see in the picture (again because of the very dark interiors), but there is a red cord hanging there."
4166,"Peter Jones, a branch of John Lewis, is fully accessible in every way, staff are eager to help, but never intrusively so. Strongly recommended, despite annoyance about the thoughtless accessible toilet provision (see below)."
4167,The venue has no parking but there is multi-storey parking about 500m away.
4168,Signage was ok. Whilst much of the park is level the tracks and much of the roads are pretty bumpy and could do with some TLC! A bit hard going for a manual wheelchair user
4169,"There are two accessible loos, one of them downstairs and the other one in the second floor of the museum, both of them are easy to access through the lift and easy to find due to the clear signs.
The loos are big enough and very clean and tidy."
4170,"The hotel entrance is made up of three side by side doorways, firstly a normal outward opening door, then a rotating doorway, with a wheelchair button and then a sensor operated automatically opening door. Unfortunately the sensor did not always work but reception staff always came to our assistance.
The reception area, on the ground floor, is large and spacious and has good lighting at all times. Unfortunately the whole of the check – in area is at chest height (standing).
Once we had checked in and been given our swipe card keys, we were taken to one of their fully adapted rooms (on the fifth Floor). The rep had come with us and before he left he gave us local contact details for himself and an idea of the local assistance he could provide. We also agreed the collection time for our homeward flight, by wheelchair accessible vehicle.
The room was spacious with plenty of room for me to get around in my wheelchair although its size might  be a problem for a non-wheelchair user.
The bathroom was well laid out with drop bars on either side of the toilet, I could get my chair under the sink and the room had under floor heating. Turning space was adequate.
For the best visual description of the shower area, see the photograph on the hotels web site.
The main dining room is on the 1st floor and is also used as the breakfast area, again staff were always happy and willing to help whenever required and space for my chair was never an issue.
In the evening a ground floor bar was open to guests.
Also on the ground floor and as part of the hotel building, there is a tapas bar and although it has level access, none of the tables in this area are wheelchair friendly, see hotel web site pictures. Wheelchair friendly tables are available in an upper area which is accessed by stairs or a street level entrance which means you have to leave the hotel to use it."
4171,No staff anywhere while we were there. 
4172,The restaurant itself  is very spacious and well laid out. The main doors are quite heavy so you would require assistance to open these. The accessible toilet has handrails but is quite small once you’re inside. There is also a sharp corner to turn off the main Cafe To get into the main toilet
4173,"We didn't use transport but the venue is easily accessed by bus, taxi or car.  There is no private car park but is on street parking and a multi-storey close by.  The multi-storey is not free to blue badge holders.  There is a bus and taxi rank just around the corner from the venue.  "
4174,The staff were very accommodating and happy to answer our questions.  We were made very welcome.
4175,"a shopping centre with excellent parking with both outdoor and with a covered multi-storey direct with access to the shops. the centre includesa Shopmobility area from which to borrow scooters, wheelchairs etc and the wide aisles and the spaces of the Centre beingwell lit and largely flat means that traveli is unimpeded. Theshops, although some are more crowded with goods and people, are largely accessible. Very good toilet and changing facilities. In addition it's not just shops as there is a number of eating places and communal areas, some outside"
4176,"We booked a table in advance, enjoyed  our  afternoon tea,(which was served at the table) price  is very reasonable. There is a Café you can purchase various food and reasonably priced too.  The Staff are all volunteers and were very helpful, making sure we found our table and topping up our tea pots.  Whilst enjoying our afternoon tea, we were able to listen to the music being played on the Wurlitzer and watching couples dancing, putting our Guest in the mod to hit the dance floor. This was a great experience for one couple who had not danced in years, a great experience for someone living with dementia, a great talking point afterwards. Staff did not hurry us and we were able to come back to our table after   having   a look around the Museum and Fairground, ( there is a small charge for Museum but Carers go Free)"
4177,"Lacking signage, but clean , tidy, and plenty of space.
Lots of tables and chairs to negotiate to access the main access to toilets"
4178,one perfect and well aware of the benefits of the ramp and changing room. One blissfully unaware of any accessibility issues.
4179,Whole area has been redeveloped - mostly flat and pedestrianised and we had the impression that planners had taken on board accessibility.  The three restaurants visited were all wheelchair friendly.  Lots to do and see and green areas for just sitting and watching the world go by.   All on Kings Cross station's doorstep.
4180,The staff are superb! 
4181,Easy access all on the flat
4182,"This being our first visit to a disabled adapted property we can say that staying in the  bungalow for a couple with one member being a power chair user, gave us an excellent week away.  Plenty of room for the power chair to get around inside and if you like sitting outside the gardens are very well tended.  Very useful local information, maps and walks available for use.  We met relatives for Saturday lunch in The Ship then went to Southbourne on the Monday to visit their home.  

Other notable trips out were to Lepe Country Park, Hordle Cliff Top Walk and the Blackwater New Forest, Tall Trees walk.

All toilet facilities we visited, at all venues, were very good and we found a couple of changes places toilets which ticked all the boxes.

Helen and Matt were very helpful when we had a medical emergency which meant we visited the Lymington Walk In Centre and then on to Bournemouth Hospital.  Just to reassure people that if you have an emergency then the facilities were extremely helpful and efficient.  

Being reassured that the accommodation and area is very good for a holiday we have booked again for next year.  Lots more on our bucket list for our next visit.  Thank you Helen and Matt."
4183,A good number of accessible spaces near the front of the store.
4184,"Very accessible with multiple changing rooms all on ground floor. All of the fitness suites, climbing wall and sports hall are accessible on the ground floor. 

I am a guide dog user and the staff are more than happy to let my guide dog stay at the reception while I use the gym. "
4185,"There is an accessible, RADAR key, toilet on the ground floor (the others are upstairs) but it is not signposted. There is a key kept behind the bar if you need it. The toilet also houses the nappy changing area and is often used by families and I have known it to be rather messy in the past though not today. The toilet roll dispenser was empty but a toilet roll had been left on the cistern - this would be very difficult to get at for some people. 
The red cord had been hooked back behind a rail. It now has a red cord card on it."
4186,"There is step free access and a lift to the first floor with accessible toilets on both levels. There is a detailed access statement available from the museum if you need more information.  Also a lift to the first floor. Accessibilty is to all parts of the museum.  Plenty of opportunities to rest and see film clips or listen to talks. The museum overall is sparkling clean, and tidy and spacious. The locals are so proud of their museum they have an interest in keeping it friendly attractive and accessible for visitors. "
4187,Plenty of seats.
4188,"The Disney hotels bus service definitely isn't super easy to use due to the fact the staff are not very accommodating. All the buses are now equipped with a ramp and a on board wheelchair space, but actually getting into that space can be difficult if there is a large crowd."
4189,"Some of the many fascinating huts had easier access than others, but enough access overall to make it a worthwhile visit even if you can't get around them easily."
4190,I saw no signage for disabled access but some sites had metal ramps for disabled users. At the Vatican all wheelchair users were given priority access through metal detectors.
4191,There is a ramp to get to the door to enter the cafe bar. The automatic doors are operated by a push button at the correct height for a wheelchair user.
4192,"Robert who met me introduced himself knew my name and was very friendly and helpful, he gave us a history of the 3 honours statue and explained the layout of the building with a map.   He had read my requirements was there to welcome me and produced a portable chair for me to sit on upon arrival, indeed we took it around with us.   He offered us tickets for Members Questions but we could not stay for this."
4193,Staff was helpful and great. They explained to do about history and story for Kew Garden and staff show us what  they are about flowers.
4194,We rang before we came and the person on the end of the phone was very helpful about parking. She advised that we did not park in the main visitor car park and told us which car park was better for disabled vehicles.
4195,"Small public park with lawn, trees, shrubs and seating. Nice spot to walk round or take a seat. There is also a children's play area.  Best know for being the location of Joseph Grimaldi's (the clown) grave. There are no toilets or cafe in this park."
4196,The access through the hotel was very good. The two lifts were a good size you drove in and backed out. The only disadvantage was the lifts didn't have a mirror on the back wall you could look through to back out.
4197,"Large car park with a number of designated disabled bays.

The number 3, 8, 29, 400, N3 buses all stop on Gilmerton Road where the store is located and only a short walk off the main road "
4198,"Restaurant staff helpful, provided a table service one morning for breakfast.  receptionist pleasant when we arrived."
4199,"Sent a DVD before the performance to explain the show, met in Reception and all access explained. Good seats in the auditorium."
4200,There are three disabled places opposite the entrance.  They are not angled to the wall and you might have a problem with a WAV with a ramp.
4201,"We travelled by car and used the on-site parking next to the building. There were 3 dedicated disabled parking spaces, car park fills quickly
Those with mobility restrictions may be better being dropped off at entrance, as carpark hilly, and quite a walk from the carpark.
Parking free to blue badge holders, advised to let reception aware on check in.
Public buses passed by 
10 minutes walk for abled bodied people from Waverley Railway Station
Noticed lots of wheelchair accessible taxis in the area"
4202,"Car park gravelly,  but ok to wheel across as not loose or deep."
4203,"A farm shop with a cafe that offers a huge range of cake served in generous portions.

A great range of farm produce & Christmas themed gifts well spaced out so easy to nogotiate in a chair. Laid out on two floors with lift.

"
4204,The staff were really lovely
4205,"I traveled using the bus, the bus station was a 10 minutes walking distance."
4206,The larger vessels also have a separate accessible loo on board which is really good.
4207,A large disabled toilet with easy access.
4208,"There are 3 disabled bays (free) to the side of the venue and a paid, covered, parking facility in the same location. "
4209,The museum is very accessible and wheelchair friendly throughout. There are no stairs to tackle to gain access to the building and the staff were very friendly and helpful too. Attractions were also extremely wheelchair user friendly as they had lifts to view the vehicles for example a tall train which meant that all visitors are able to enjoy the experience. There are also lifts to gain access to the cafe and other attractions that  are upstairs. A great day out for everyone.
4210,"There is parking outside the venue but this is perpendicular to the pavement which can cause problems to people who need plenty of room to enter/exit the car.
There are bus stops on the main road not far from the entrance."
4211,"Accessible parking spaces are right outside. You usually have to type in your car registration number on a tablet when you arrive. Not sure if they are currently using the same system (recently reopened post Covid-19 lockdown). Near to bus stops which are on the number 2, 14, 30 and 33 Lothian buse routes. "
4212,"The hotel is part of the Union square shopping mall & there are lifts & escalators up to the foyer, which is wide & spacious. there are lifts to all the rooms."
4213,Access is reasonable for a small building. 
4214,"It’s a lovely traditional Scottish hotel with very extensive grounds, a good range of activities (untested) and crucially, amongst its many associated lodges and cottages , a three bedroom cottage with a ground floor adapted, accessible room. It’s not bad. I have M.S. and it’s getting worse - two or three years ago and the cottage would have been perfect, now  however it was a bit of a challenge. Overall access is very good; there is ample adjacent parking, good ramped access to a nice wide front  door and plenty  of room indoors for my big powerchair to manoeuvre. It’s nicely furnished and decorated and feels nicely upmarket. The adapted room is a good sized double with an ensuite bath/shower room.  Again, I was able to manoeuvre around easily enough - a bit of jiggary-pokery with chairs and occasional furniture is just what you expect and certainly this is better than most in that respect. The bathroom has an accessible shower with a basic shower chair available. The floor is non slip, a good point - how many otherwise useable bathrooms are ruined by ceramic tiled floors? There is also a bath but no way to get in - a pity as I like a bath. The loo is a bit on the low side and only has one drop down grab rail - left facing, and no other fixed rails. There is a ceiling track hoist between the door via the bed area to the bathroom but it’s a bit old and clunky and whilst it goes over the bath, there is no bathing sling.  The main hotel building has decent access and the staff are friendly - we went with a large family group and had separate catering so I can’t speak for restaurant or bar provision . "
4215,"Would be a 5, only the parking that causes problems."
4216,"Fantastic service.
Very welcoming and friendly and did all they could to help."
4217,Limited parking but there are several buses.
4218,"Large double doors in, which were open and no steps so no issues getting in. When I'd booked the table I'd let them know one of us was a manual wheelchair user so they had given us a table with more room around it."
4219,"Has it’s own car park with a few disabled bays. The car park is only small however I have visited many a times and never struggled to access a disabled bay. 

I don’t know if you can access from public transport but it is near Braintree Designer Village which is near a train station and bus stop. It is very close to a busy road and round about and would not think it is safe to walk from these public transport locations "
4220,"There are 2 parking spaces right outside Clober Farm at the front door, this means that it is easier for wheelchair users to get access to the house. Especially if the weather is bad.

Due to not knowing about this area of Glasgow I can’t really comment on the public transport, however there was a train 10 minutes away from Clober Farm.

I visited the SEC Glasgow whilst staying and it was roughly a 30-minute drive from Clober Farm to here. It is also roughly the same amount of time to the city centre of Glasgow."
4221,"All disabled rooms on ground floor.NO lift.All ground floor,connecting Pub and car park level---NO STEPS."
4222,"Wide doors , all flat and level inside ."
4223,"There is disabled parking at the door to the museum. Easiest way is to take a cab. For the sake of our Euan's we did it on public transport, in this case the Metro (underground) see the sacrifices we make!
If you go by Metro you alight at San Sebastao. Do not take ""El Corte Ingles"" access if you can't do steps. Once out of the underground head for the crossing at the El Corte department store. Cross downhill onto Rua Marques de Fronteira. Behind the tall new building you will see a gate to a fortress. Forwa d of the take a left down a narrow street Rua Doutor Nicolau Bettencourt. Follow the red asphalt path to the bottom of the hill, round to the right and enter the museum park via the driveway for cars. Follow it round to the left to the main door to the museum. Ignore the path marked with the wheelchair symbol that just takes you into the park. "
4224,"The staff are lovely, eager to help, eager to explain and inform, so they made it a happy experience."
4225,Excellent you can park outside your Lodge
4226,"Two areas of entry, one is flat. No lift to get upstairs"
4227,"There are no Morrison’s stores where I live, so this was a very welcome and positive experience to get groceries and have a cuppa afterwards. Very spacious with wide accessible aisles, lots of staff to assist with getting things from out of reach places - this in itself a real bonus. Whilst a lot of their core produce is their own brand, it’s good to get unusual things that you know only come from where they originated from. So, don’t mind a wee bit of Shipley, Yorkshire in Scotland. A fully provisioned and very busy cafe serving again, their own branded products at excellent prices. Bags of room for those of us who need it with priority seating and service. Assistance dogs welcome and very helpful and attentive staff. What’s useful, is they have little lockers for your trolly so you don’t have to think about it getting in the way of you and others, one customer was assisted by staff to the car park. Can’t complain about the cuppa for a ‘ store ‘ service at all, brought over for me. Did not use the loos but was informed they were fully access available equipped and well serviced."
4228,Staff very helpful.

New Fancy view.    SAT NAV.   GL15 4HS

This was an old mining area at one time, now converted into a lovely woodland walking and cycling area, with a viewpoint overlooking forestry scenery
The whole of the forest had many mines scattered around, Iron, Coal and stone quarries all with their own tales to tell.
Iron was mined by the Romans, and in the 11th century mines were operated, and modern history tells us that by 1066 iron was forged at Gloucester, and the area remained as the chief iron producing district until 14th century. The deposits of cinders, in mounds, have been found, and in 1258, Cinderford was recorded as being in operation. Small foundries were formed, some to provide castings for the tramways being built here, 1st built by 1821 at Bradley. The first tram road was a short line built in 1795, and a second line was then built and extended to Lydbrook by 1803, but this track was lifted by 1815. Between 1809 and 1812 three horse drawn working cast iron tramroads were built, linking two rivers between Lydbrook and Lydney. As time progressed, various owners delayed the use of steam traction for many years, but eventually a broad gauge steam railway was opened in 1854. A branch line was built to New Fancy colliery in 1869.  
However, the carrying of passengers was of no real concern although a few miles did allow for this, and the line from Gloucester to Cinderford continued until 1958.
The last working section, from PARKEND to Lydney, which was carrying ballast, 
continued until 1976, but that was then bought in 1983 as the Dean Forest railway,
but all the rest of the railroads had almost finished by the end of the First World War. Today, almost all of the routes of the tramroads have been converted into 
public woodland paths, as seen at New Fancy.

Coal was also mined in the forest, being dug out in the mid 1240,s, and the Crown received rents from 1250. By late 1464, the Crown regulated the mining industry.
During 18th century industry increased, with mines such as, Long looked for, Pluck Penny, Small profit, just small collieries, then in 1824 a survey of the strata was published and 121 mines were listed. At New Fancy, they have put down a concrete map of the area of mines, listing them on the map, and you can see these mines on photos 3, 4 and 5. 
In 1946 the National Coal board operated the main mines, but by 1992 only a few mines and a few buildings survived, and now, only 7 mines remain.

Our review with photos continue now following our forest trip, so put in SAT NAV directions, and after leaving Beechenhurst ( see review ) driving through some lovely forest scenery, and quite a few miles later we arrived at New Fancy site. (photo 1).
We parked the car in one of two parking areas (photo 2), and headed for the Geomap that has been laid in concrete (photo 3) of all the mines in the forest, with a close up for you to see (photo 4), the round markers numbered for each mine (photo 5).  The forest paths lead off into the forest (photo 6) but these are not suitable for disabled at all (photo 7) as far to hilly, but it is a beautiful area to see. 
Just by the car parks, on a little mound, stands the Roll of Honour monument (photo 8)

Our final thoughts
Following a very scenic drive we arrived at New Fancy, but not much there, so we just looked at the Geomap, and moved on, as it not accessible for wheelchairs.
===================================================================

MALLARDS PIKE.        SAT NAV.   GL15 4HD

A short drive away we come to Mallards Pike (photo 9)  A PIKE is a hill with a peaked top, and this Pike is named after a toll road in the area, and the name Mallard is named after a mr Miller who lived in a toll keepers cottage until the early 1950’s.

Mallards Pike is actually a beautiful lake surrounded by woodland, and now converted as a family park, with picnic areas, a Go Ape course with zip wires, Tarzan swings, lots of cycling trails, and for the younger children the Gruffalo orienteering course, where by using a simple map they can try to find 12 hidden markers in the woods. The whole area is a delightful walking experience with different trails, although disabled are rather limited in what we can do, but more than enough to keep us happy. Toilets are available, and during the summer a small cafe which can be very handy.  It’s also an ideal place for your canine friends, they will love it here.
Your wheelchairs and scooters have an accessible ride all around the lake (see photos 15 and 16. ) and no matter what time of the year you come here the scenery is a delight.

Our photos now will help you enjoy your visit, and it’s only a short drive away from New Fancy before you arrive at Mallards Pike (photo 9).  We drove round to park in one of two disabled bays, (photo 10) right opposite toilet block (photo 11). A disabled toilet is available and pulling a face we thought it a very basic toilet in need of 
attention. It does have a grab rail and you would get a wheelchair inside.
The main path leads along to lakeside (photo 13) in a lovely setting (photo 14) and picnic tables are available. (photo 15).
On the opposite bank, wheelchairs are able to cope to enjoy the delightful scenery.
The cafe looks quite nice, (photo 17) but being closed for winter we could not see inside. 
Beyond the carpark there is a path that leads to the Go Ape adventure playground 
(photo 18) but it’s rather a long ride from the start (photo 19) through beautiful scenery, to get to the adventure playground, so we returned to the carpark.
For younger children there is a small Gruffalo trail. (photo 20)

Our final thoughts
A beautiful place to go and see, and well worth going to see it, even though you have to pay a £2.00 charge, which is paid by cash only at a ticket machine. For a young person it’s a great place for them
==================================================================

From here it’s a short ride through an area of woodland known as “The Golden Mile”, because of its late Autumn colours, to return you to the starting point again at Dean Heritage centre SAT NAV. GL14 2UB. And then your return home

"
4230,"Access to reception very easy, electric doors and ramp.  Took a star off for some of the trails being a little more natural and so unsuitable for some."
4231,"absolutely fabulous, and very helpful."
4232,"access to ticket booth good but ramps steep to platforms. There are no lifts to the platforms but you access to a car heading the Glasgow direction, can use the new park that has direct access to the platform but this is only accessible via vehicle. Ramps on and off train must be booked I advanced. "
4233,"Everyone one we bumped into was kind, caring and friendly."
4234,"Very good access for me as a wheelchair user. Slope leading to the main door which has a pad entry, where you push the pad at the side of the door and door opens automatically. There is good level access once inside with good space."
4235,There is a very large wet floor shower with a toilet that has rails. There was a shower seat but no rails at the shower 
4236,"I am pushing hard for Blackbird to become my local. I have never taken claim over a pub before but today, I put my first one forward. Run by the same folk that look after P Mac's and Cassidy's, there's a serious selection of craft beers here and even though I end up guzzling more Brooklyn Lager than I should, I will explore their full collection eventually. The style is kitsch and when they have a bed as a table, you have to ask if it's one kitsch too far. I will forgive them for that though. Their pizzas are pretty decent and the music goes from brilliant to ""Did I fall into a 2007 indie vortex?"" but maybe the best thing here is the staff. Straight up pack of sounders."
4237,"Despite a very windy day and the site being very sloping, well worth visiting, 
Some areas not very accessible you can see that British Heritage are working hard on this. 
WW2 tunnels very interesting."
4238,Easy signage.
4239,"On arrival we spoke to one of the many guides who explained what could be accessed and how. The majority of the Cathedral is accessible. 
Some areas needed a lift to get to which they were quick to access for us."
4240,"Truro is a beautiful, small, historic city. The city centre streets are cobbled, presenting some issues for wheelchair users. Slopey but not hilly. I am an active wheelie and managed ok with an add-on (not a powered one). 

We parked at the nearby NCP. There was a lift and a steep-ish ramp down. 

The ramp up to the cathedral was steep and I needed a push (it would have been fine with a powered chair). This was also true of the ramps in the cathedral. 

The toilet used a radar key. It was fantastic! Spacious and spotless."
4241,"Over the years I have visited La Cala De Mijas many times, which is in the Costa Del Sol, Spain.  In the past it has not been the most accessible place, however, the community and local committee have been working to change that. They have taken up all of the public paths and replaced them, making them wider and ensuring they are all level and accessible for wheelchairs, which makes getting around the town a lot easier. Furthermore, they have put boardwalks all along the beach so people who may have mobility difficulties are able to access the beach and sea, with regular monitoring from lifeguards. At the Lifeguard station they have made accessible sun-loungers on a level access floor on the beach and have also provided wheelchairs and walking sticks that can be used on the sand and in the sea to make access into the water easier for everyone. they have also included a disabled friendly outside shower on the beach, and this is based near a disabled toilet. The Lifeguards are always willing to help and are very friendly and regularly patrol the whole of the beach. All of the public transport is very cheap and accessible for wheelchair users.  This is a great holiday destination for families to visit as they are constantly looking at new ways to improve their facilities."
4242,Calvert trust Exmoor is one of the most accessible places I have ever been. I had a full weekend of outdoor adventure in a beautiful setting surrounded by the most helpful people and fully accessible. It really is an amazing place
4243,"The RWA gallery is currently closed for a big building project and will reopen in spring 2022. When I was in the building before the building work began, it still made a good visit despite Covid restrictions. Beautiful Grade II listed building, being upgraded with accessibility in mind. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The grand-looking building hosts exhibitions of both new and old art, and there are workshops and activities run by artists for adults and children on and off-site. Automatic doors at the entrance to the building, very old lift being replaced soon with a brand new one. The accessible toilet is fine but a new changing places toilet is additionally being installed during the building project. When reopened, RWA will continue to have a new exhibition every three months. 
During Covid restrictions you needed to prebook a time slot, so this might continue for some events/shows."
4244,Located in Ilkeston town centre.
4245,"Probably the best festival for disabled people and their carers in the world. Free carer tickets, excellent level access disabled parking and campsite, amazingly nice volunteer stewarding, disabled access platforms, the list goes on and on."
4246,"Level access, automatic electric doors.

Wheelchair accessible trolleys are located inside. Mobility scooters & manual wheelchairs available.  They also have the small metal baskets.

Hearing loops were available according to signs. 

I didn't see any designated accessible tills. Not much space at scan and go tills. 

The shelving and fridges/freezers were typical of supermarkets and difficult to access. The scales for fruit and veg was really high. 

No music but they do have a tannoy system.

The lift to up stairs is at back of store inside the Argos. "
4247,"This Cafe Nero is a lovely little cafe right in the heart of Stirling on port street. It has delicious cakes, pastries and lovely fresh coffee and teas. The downstairs area is all accessible complete with loo and a step free entrance into the building. "
4248,"All the staff at the theatre made visit for me and my guide dog excellent experience
Have attended the theatre for many years and always enjoyed visits but recently as need to attend with my guide dog was anxious - extra space was given for her to sit with us during performance but also staff were happy to care for her when she found part of it a bit too noisy and long for her!
They arranged a touch tour on the stage to see scenery, costumes and props and allocated our group a space before the show to eat and supplied us coffee All staff very friendly"
4249,There was a standard disabled toilet but Lowri needs a Changing Places toilet. Knowing this in advance when planning the trip we asked to change her in the first aid room (using the hoist of Mum and Dad...) which worked ok.
4250,Walking distance from Waterloo which is accessible on the Jubilee Line. Not sure about parking.
4251,Sandy beach with rock pools. Benches to sit and stare out to sea... Small beach so it's perfect just to chill out for half an hour!
4252,"On entry all staff welcoming. Accessible room good size and well designed for the wheelchair. Bathroom good ample towels and basic toiletries. Plug sockets are handy for chair charging. Room has double bed, but on enquiring about twins was told to phone and ask for Complimentary Carers Room next time."
4253,"Fantastic scenery, very helpful staff, a good experience but toilets could be better.
We arrived mid morning , showed blue badge and were directed to the car park near the cafe and offices etc.  All the staff were really helpful, and made getting onto the lifts and tows fairly easy.  I have a biski and my Dad helps me to ski.  
Toilets not good, no disabled toilet at the cafe up the slope  near Plastic slope, and  Dad said they were not good either being over used and not checked.  The disabled toilet at the cafe by the car park was  ok but agree a changing place would be fantastic, as it takes me longer to get ready, and in the wind it is not fun.  Skiing was good and other skiers and borders were really friendly.   DSUK  contacts gave advice about area to ski."
4254,"It is so great to see the baby changing facilities separate from the accessible toilet! The toilet was large and clean, and I even spotted a Euan's Guide Red Cord Card!"
4255,"Last weekend was the fourth Electric Fields. After going last year and having a brilliant time, we couldn't wait to go back and see if the access had improved and if it would be as fun as last year.

With seeing acts like Aldus Harding, Real Estate, Anna Meredith, Foxygen,  Jesus and Mary Chain and Arab Strap we were promised a great weekend.

I am writing this review as somebody who has poorer balance and has has a speech barrier and who camped."
4256,"Ramped access to entrance. Two doors, outer one quite heavy so may struggle if on your own. We only visited the tea rooms, didn't do the museum, but access to tea rooms very good."
4257,"Staff are friendly but food service is slow and erratic, we were not impressed that two tables got their food before us although they arrived a long time after us and had the same choices of food.
When I asked for some toilet paper, the barman was friendly and quick to run upstairs and fetch me some, but didn't want to put it in the dispenser for me, and didn't seem to take seriously my comments about their having the red emergency cord much too short."
4258,Parking on a flat surface next to the door - it's the sort of museum you won't have to fight through the crowds to get into or for parking! It's out in the countryside so I don't think you can arrive by bus.
4259,"Really can't fault the staff. Super friendly, I'll definitely visit again. "
4260,I was unable to use the toilet on my visit as there was something preventing the door from closing. I did mention this to a member of staff so I am hoping this is now resolved.
4261,"Staff were friendly when you spoke to them, and I saw some interacting well with children visiting. 
They did seem very busy though, and having a few more staff at peak times might be good. "
4262,Very helpful.
4263,"There is a ground floor accessible toilet. It's spacious, clean with grab rails but no emergency cord. The first time I went I was standing for a while to get into the accessible toilet and when I went to ask staff to check if someone was in it, they came with me and opened it, telling me it sometimes locks itself."
4264,"Easy flat enterance.  Step free access via an easy slope, but two steps if preferred.   Volunteers will advise.  Flat surface throughout. Seats available.  All restaurant area good.   Outside area accessible, toilets clean and roomy with a red cord.  Gravel garden."
4265,"At the front desk there is a lower desk if you need one.
Most of the route round was on a downward slop but where there was steps there was a lift. 
I prefer to go on the designated 'Quiet Days' as I get to see more as there are less people getting in the way of my wheelchair and pushing in front of me. 
At some of the tanks there was seating so my carer could sit next to me.
Information can be provided in audio format as well as braille and large.
On the 'Quiet Days' all talks have a BSL interpreter.
"
4266,There are a handful of blue badge space in each car park but you need to know which platform your train is going from to make sure you park in the correct place and avoid a hilly walk between them
4267,Disabled ramp at front door was fine for me but might be a tight fit for a scooter.
4268,Accessible entrance from Constitution Street. Ramp into restaurant. Decent amount of space for manoeuvring. Tables and chairs all moveable.
4269,"Once the home to Robin Hood, and now home to about a hundred squirrels, this forest is filled with wildlife and woodland walks. The forest is fully accessible to wheelchairs, and it is even possible to hire wheelchairs for free from the visitors centre. The ground is often solid mud, making the walks easily accessible for wheelchair users. This forest is exactly what you'd expect to find if you took a forest out of a children's book and placed it in the middle of England. Totally covered by trees and home to rabbits, squirrels and even the occasional owl, this forest won't disapoint."
4270,Okay. Step free access from street. Vestibule area at door is narrow so difficult to turn if in a larger chair. Restaurant itself has enough room to manoeuvre without disrupting other customers. Tables at good height for my power chair.
4271,Fantastic access
4272,Brilliant upgrade to the visitor centre. It's well thought out with accessibility in mind. Being built on one level makes accessibility easy for all.
4273,"There are at least 2 accessible toilets - maybe more, but I've only used two. they have always been clean and tidy and have enough room for a wheelchair and a carer."
4274,"Friendly, traditional pub on the main street in Dawlish, which serves delicious food. The outdoor seating overlooks the Brook. "
4275,"The nearest tube station is Victoria, which is also now step free. From the tube/ train station it is a good 5 - 8 minutes walk. There are several buses that stop close by. On the first visit it can be a little bit hard to find. However if you walk from the train station along the main road to Victoria Coach Station. The café itself is on Ebury Street, a side street at the back of Victoria Coach Station. The café is very pink and flowery and can be seen in the distance when you turn into Ebury Street. "
4276,No designated car park but you can park on the street outside the cafe and there are many buses stopping nearby.
4277,"As well as the train station being approx 10 mins away, there is also designated accessible car parking areas. These car parks are still some distance away from the course but if you phone the access line beforehand you can get into the car park that is closest to the course."
4278,We found the access for two of our group who have mobility issues was very good and made use of the lifts to access the building which were clearly signposted.
4279,"All very welcoming, considerate and helpful."
4280,"There are plenty of accessible parking at this Cineworld with it being located in a shopping centre and they are fairly close to the entrance.

I'm not from Glasgow so cannot comment on the public transport but, I did see bus stops nearby which looked like they came from all over Glasgow."
4281,Straff were very welcoming and friendly. They even took care of my friend's guide dog during the performance! 
4282,Friendly and helpful. 
4283,"Accessible toilet was ok, door quite heavy but suitable and clean, room to move and grab rails to support.  
The pull cord did not reach the floor. "
4284,"a reasonably long ramp at the harbour side and the same at the front, both leading to a completely accessible front door."
4285,"There is disabled parking close to the main entrance. At the time of our stay it was fully occupied, however the manager was very helpful in ensuring we could park close to the door"
4286,From a public transport perspective and as a wheelchair user travelling with a visually impaired person transport was good. Assistance on and off trains was seamless with help on hand at arrival and departure. An accessible bus service stopped in the station's car park and the service offered a circular route around the town. There were loads of black cab style taxis and many had wheelchair access. Drop of points and short term parking were available in the car park.
4287,"I have been parking inside the centre for a weeks because of the bad weather, I would usually park on the street outside with free parking for blue badge holders.
I had noticed it was difficult to get a disabled bay as most were taken by vehicles which were not displaying blue badges.
I contacted the centre to ask if the blue badge scheme is enforced with fines but was told that it was not and they just expected drivers to park responsibily.
I dont see the point in the centre having disabled bays if its not enforced as those of us who need it can't access one.
I wouldn't recommend paying the money to park in this centre as a blue badge holder."
4288,Access from nearby streets and a wide and smooth surface make for great wheelchair access. You can get down on to the beach at points but this isn't recommended unless you have a beach wheelchair. There are plenty of places to stop and sit and admire the fantastic views. There are a couple of cafés where you can get a coffee and in the summer the odd ice cream van appears.
4289,Receptionist was very helpful and friendly.
4290,Located in Ilkeston town centre.
4291,Good
4292,"Great food, cocktails, and atmosphere. Accessible bathroom and access by the hotel."
4293,"They have done all they can with the venue to make it accessible but because it's a slim old building some of the corridors are quite tight. Ramp from street is good. Entrance door has a push button to open. 
Cinema 1 is accessed via a lift that we just squeezed into. Cinemas 2 and 3 are accessed via a platform lift which isn't great for a powerchair."
4294,"Disabled loo on the ground floor, you do need to open two doors however.  Spacious enough, could do with a slightly higher toilet."
4295,"As a wheelchair user, checked out the website and found that the Rabat train took a wheelchair. The gentleman in charge swiftly loaded me (along with my wife) in a friendly manner."
4296,"There is a ramp up from the car park to the ice rink entrance. Wide entrance doors and gates. There is a lift - it wasn't working the day we went. Fortunately my son has some mobility so we managed,  but it would definitely be worth ringing in advance if the lift is a must for your needs, as there are about 25 steps down to the ice level - the accessible toilet is also down at this lower level.  The cafe is on the upper level, but was very warm with a good viewing window and had plenty of space for manoeuvering the wheelchair. There is a ramp for access on to the ice, but again ring in advance as it took the (very helpful) staff some minutes to locate it and bring it to us."
4297,Friendly and helpful but tracks pretty bumpy and knowledge of bus accessibility limited
4298,I went to the Scotland Vs Samoa rugby match on the 11th of November and it was a simply stunning stadium and one of the best stadiums that I have been to. Great staff and tremendous view.
4299,We mentioned needing access to the rear of the car so were given a spot with plenty of space. In conversation the staff also mentioned that we could have driven down to the water if necessary (there was a short compact gravel path from the activity centre to the water)
4300,"This building houses three doctor surgeries, Social Work and Learning Disability Services.
Audiology, podiatry, physiotherapy, speech and language and community nurses."
4301,"We taxi-ed in, there were road closures for Christmas shopping but the taxi can normally drive into swinegate in the evening."
4302,"You have a car park on site and there is also on street parking.
You can get here by the number 34 and 3 bus which passes close by."
4303,"Really nice staff who try to help no matter how hard a task it may be.
"
4304,"There is an accessible disabled toilets , there are grab bars and space for a wheelchair. There is not really an adult changing space. "
4305,Could not have been more helpful and friendly 
4306,We went on the bus which stops not far from the venue.  The street that the restaurant is on is pedestrianised. 
4307,Staff were helpful and polite
4308,"Disabled access into the shopping center is good as it can be accessed from ground level, it also has lifts to transport those to the shops on the other grounds. There are signs to tell you which shops are on which level, there are no hearing or induction loops, there is also no option for sign language or braille access from what I have experienced."
4309,"For this particular review we are able to give top marks as it was all on the level, be it a bit of a nuisance to have to go out of hotel and walk all the way round and across the terrace to reach the disabled door for George’s Bar lounge. (On this particular visit, we met a member of the hotels management, and he registered our concerns about this long walk, and stated not to worry, it was all in hand, so we await to see any future alterations they may have in mind to help disabled ) 
To get us around today, two lifts were available, and that really helped my husband to get to see everything he had not yet seen ) which still impressed him so much, he does nothing but show his appreciation for the efforts of Handpicked hotels every time he comes back from his wandering around exploring Stanbrook Abbey.
You take the lift down from outside reception desk, stroll around the cellars and all the interesting rooms that run off from the passage , then take another lift at the far end of cellar to take you back up to far end of this lovely hotel."
4310,Car
4311,It was big and spacious but a wee bit messy!
4312,Good friendly staff. Location is good and accessible with bus routes and disabled parking available outside. The tables are very close together making it difficult to manoeuvre. Ordering food and coffees at counter is very tight for space for a wheelchair. Able to sit outside if it was a nice day.
4313,Staff are brilliant pleasant and friendly inside arena and outside in the complex o2angels are fantastic so I don't understand a previous reviewer having problems. As for confiscating drink you need to explain it's required for tablets etc and they will either let you in or consult with a medic because I have the same problem as I take solvable tablets bottled water is available at all outlets at a cost of 2ukp but you can as for tap water and it will be provided. Staff will also fetch food and drink for disabled customers
4314,"Specialist equipment eg ceiling tracking hoists, electric profiling beds, air flow mattress, Clos-o-Mat toilets, riser/recliner chairs, shower chair/commodes, shower trolley, hearing loop, TV listening system, turn stand, flashing door bell and telephone alert, vibrating fire alarm, wheelchairs are all provided. 
Accessible Paxton Centre - alternative therapies, accessible activities and a place to relax and chat"
4315,"Soho Theatre offers a busy programme of theatre, cabaret,  stand up comedy  and a bar. There's a 150 seat theatre auditorium, a downstairs with level entry cabaret tables and raised stage and upstairs a 92 seater theatre. There is also a bar on the ground floor.


My review is of my visit to see Rosie Jones perform in the Upstairs space. "
4316,disabled parking close to building entrance
4317,The Mayflower have no parking but there is a reasonable amount of parking very close to the theatre.  It is on a busy bus route and is just 5 minutes easy walk from Southampton train station.
4318,"The Glyptotek is an art museum, which has the personal art collection of the Carlsberg Breweries founder's son.  The collection includes Greek, Roman, Egyptian and European art. In the centre is the Winter Gardens and café.  Look out for the Nasothek, a collection of noses. The building itself is impressive and ornate and shows off the collection beautifully. Most of the gallery is accessible but there are some parts which you can only get to via steps."
4319,I travelled to the Cutty Sark by boat and from Greenwich Pier there was a step free route to the ship. The nearest station is Cutty Sark on the Docklands Light Railway 9DLR) which has step free access.
4320,Wheelchair accessible venue.  Spacious.  Lots to see.  Relaxing.
4321,Helpful and friendly.
4322,They seemed friendly enough and looked as if they could advice you on what you need to know.
4323,Disabled parking is directly down the hill. I would advice to use a powerchair or a carer who pushes your wheelchair.
4324,Cheerful and staff communicated well. 
4325,"There is an easily locatable toilet on the ground floor which is big enough for wheelchair access. There are grab rails and toilet rails in the toilet, as well as a emergency pull cord which is within reaching distance from the toilet itself. The toilet area was clean and pleasant and there was enough room for a carer, however there wouldn't be much room to move around and manoeuvre. "
4326,"Not as much here compared to the past and it is spread out over a greater area of Edinburgh.  The kids section is very hard to access and is far away from the rest of the attractions. The ice skating (viewing) is also not easily accessible without encountering steps. 

Security are very helpful but staff are less helpful and unsure of things."
4327,There was one there but I didn't use it.
4328,"Note this is not for rooms but only for meeting rooms, main reception and toilets on the ground floor go in and on left down corridor for disabled toilets."
4329,"The Sill is the National Discovery Centre for the Northumberland National Park.  We were so impressed - its just opened and they have a full changing places toilet in the visitors area, highly accessible cafe and ramped access to the roof garden for views along Hadrian Wall.  The exhibition area had a lot of displays accessible from wheelchair height and was very interactive. We had a great day out and felt it had been designed very considerately for wheelchair users - even the circular benches outside had been designed with space at each one for a wheelchair to access the table."
4330,"The few we met where very friendly and willing to offer support
"
4331,"Kingsbarns distillery is set on beautiful Fife coastal farmland with great views. The building conversion is very thoughtfully done with a lot of attention paid to accessibility. The only disappointment for us was the platform lifts, which we find difficult due to the size of my brother's powerchair. Aside from this access for us was excellent, with easy parking, wide doors, good sized accessible loos and incredibly helpful staff. The tour is excellent as is the spirit to taste at the end!"
4332,Virtually outside the entrance
4333,"Access is excellent across the board.  The cottages are fully accessible on the ground floor, with superbly fitted kitchen, sitting room and bedroom with top of the range hoist.  Lowered worktop area in kitchen and flat access to the private garden area and patio in front. 
The upstairs area is not accessible, but the bedrooms are beautifully finished and decorated with stupendous views over the Forth. A luxurious holiday cottage for the whole family."
4334,On the whole disabled access was great. There are lifts between floors and I was able to stay in my wheelchair through security. To get on to the plane I used a lift that is on the back of a lorry to get to the plane door and an aisle seat to my chair. The staff were all brilliant throughout this and explained what to expect. 
4335,"Once inside, the access is good and the side entrance is doable with a chair."
4336,"I booked a 6 hour private taxi tour of Corfu island with Dimitris Dafnis. I booked with him as he was the only taxi tour website for Corfu which mentioned disability. The tour was amazing and explored the less touristy sights on the island. We went to the beach, into the hills where we had wonderful views and visited lots of villages. In the one day I felt I had seen so much of the island and had learnt about the history, culture and local life. Highly recommend this tour."
4337,The family and staff here are very welcoming and friendly. Nothing was a bother. Attentive but not intrusive 
4338,Botanical gardens with tropical and subtropical plants. Unfortunately lots of access issues otherwise I would have given it 5 out of 5 as the gardens themeselves are beautiful. Access is not great but it is do-able.
4339,The toilet in the lobby was spacious however there was only one grab rail to use.
4340,"The disabled loo in the public areas is fine for ambulant and manual wheelchair users. It is not wide enough to rotate my powered wheelchair. As the disabled Courtyard bedroom 26 is on the same level, use of the toilet in your bathroom provides more room. In my large powered wheelchair rotating in the bathroom is not easy but I can walk a few steps. "
4341,"Hotel is very easy to find, just off the ring road - head in direction of the train station.
Plenty of open air parking right by the front door, including dedicated disabled parks.
Apart from needing a confirmed parking space with  extra space on passenger side, we had no specific requests.  But while we were there, a Swiss party with disabled guests arrived, who needed much more space to park and unload etc.  They had called in advance, and the hotel was very happy to accommodate them.  We know this, because the staff  let us know, so that we would not park in the space allocated to them."
4342,"I felt really bad for the staff, lots of young women who were not well managed- not their fault. The VIP ‘area’ was not marked at all so people were constantly flooding past us and not knowing it was an accessible then VIP row, most wouldn’t listen to the poor girls either who tried desperately to shout the rules over the music. The supervisor seemed very stressed, there were collections of staff in quiet areas and a serious lack of them in isles where they were needed. Some were friendly, but they didn’t seem to know what they were doing and didn’t seem to be supporting eachother. "
4343,"I have visited before but this review is going to focus on disabled access since the covid measures have been introduced. 

I visited on 27 May 2021 and at that time all visits to the library need to be pre-booked via their website. If you are wanting to use the reading rooms, you will need to book a slot and then order your books. "
4344,The staff are all very understanding and willing to help.
4345,There is a slight step up into the shop and the actual door space is pretty small I imagine it would be difficult accessing the shop if you were in a wheelchair or required an assistive aid.
4346,"Very easy to get in, lots of space, wide doorway and built in ramp access. As soon as I entered I was greeted by a friendly member of staff. I asked to use the toilet and get a take away cup of tea, the man showed me where the toilet was and offered to remove the baby changing table but I still fit in. There was plenty of space for me to move around, I did transfer into one of the seats at the table. "
4347,The only staff we spoke to were in the café. They seemed pleasant enough.
4348,Disabled toilets require a Radar key which means disabled people actually get to use them. However if you haven't got one it appears you have no choice but to buy one from customer services. There is also only one per area so again there is a wait and must be worse when busy.
4349,I drove to the beach car park on Beach Road. It’s a Pay and Display Car park although you can pay by card ( instructions on the Pay and Display machine). The car park is large and mainly hard standing. There are a very limited number of Blue Badge spaces but if you don’t need one of those there was ample room to park early on in the day.
4350,The staff we have encountered on various visits have been very helpful. Cafe staff are willing to carry trays to your table if requested.
4351,"I arrived from the street side of the Mound and had used a Lothian bus to get there. Great service, as all the buses have low floor level access and powered ramps that the driver puts down at the touch of a button. The Galleries are also right next door to one of Edinburgh's new tram stops; again a great accessible service."
4352,Wheelchair accessible through the side entrance. Once inside a ramp takes you up to the upper restaurant that level. I'm only able to fit my wheelchair underneath table 6 though!! Disabled toilet is a little challenging but feasible
4353,Some staff offered assistance in their own areas to fetch and carry clothes / shoes to you but without an accessible changing room near to each individual store ( as you have to pay at each store within the shop) this had limited value.
4354,Clear signage and easy to enter the building.
4355,"The toilet was clean and with a clear transfer space. I’ve taken a mark off as the red cord did not reach the floor, this could also be easily fixed."
4356,The Barbican Centre is located in the City of London so is very central. The nearest step free tube is Farringdon. There are several buses that stop close by. There is disabled parking. The Barbican Centre is a large complex with several levels. Their website provides good information about how to get to the centre and there are excellent pictorial maps which show you step free routes from the nearest tube stations. Unfortunately the tube stations featured don't have step free access. It would be good if they updated their maps to include a step free route from Farringdon which is accessible.
4357,Paved path to barn. No steps. Low threshold that wheelchair could be taken over. Space to move about in main area and surfaces made moving easy (in a wheelchair).
4358,"Both lodges comprise a double bedroom with en suite wetroom bathroom with grabrails and a moveable showerseat, plus a twin room and a bathroom with shower over the bath. the only improvement I would make would be a higher level loo, but as there are grabrails, it was not a big problem. "
4359,There are ramps throughout the ground floor of this 800 year old building making it completely accessible for a wheelchair user.  There are plenty of pews where you can stop to take a rest.
4360,Level access and easy to get about
4361,Very good Loo's
4362,Step on the front door is possible to get over but that's about it. Restaurant is narrow and higgledy-piggledy. I think if you had a non-powered chair you could possibly negotiate some of the steps and tuck yourself in at one of the tables but it would be difficult
4363,Excellent tarmac footpaths all round. Well maintained.
4364,Very friendly and helpful
4365,Level access throughout. Tables are a good height for wheelchair.
4366,"All toilets at the mall have at least one disabled toilet. However, the disabled toilets have no items/equipment. The only difference is, it has a larger stall. "
4367,They are friendly 
4368,"Visited here, with my walker, my disability means i have trouble steps and slopes. No steps at all here which is rare and great, lots of space to get through with my walker and to leave it at the side of the table. The staff wanted to help as much as they can, asking where i wanted to sit- what was best and how they could help, allowing me time to settle (i'm not very speedy). Well done staff for making the experience comfortable. Disabled toilet at the back of the restaurant, only down side is parking is hard as its in town but there is trinity square car park behind."
4369,"Disabled toilet provided meeting Changing Places criteria. Access by RADAR key, available from staff. "
4370,Friendly. Many are volunteers
4371,"A difficult review to write as the staff were great, the access was pretty good (what we saw), but the lift was out of order."
4372,Didn't really meet many staff.  Those at entry & cafe friendly.
4373,"Accessible entrance, accessible loo,  very tasty food & delicious coffee!"
4374,Flat entrance with a wheelchair for customers to usee. 
4375,"Caffè Nero in Inverness is a great wee coffee shop and a good place to meet friends etc. It has plenty of room to move in your wheelchair/mobility scooter, plus it has great tasty products."
4376,"The Station is a beautifully converted old railway station that now houses a restaurant, 3 cinema screens, a chocolate shop, ice-cream parlor, mini brewery, bakery and cheese making. All of which are independently owned and produce amazing quality goods. There is also a large selection of artwork on display around the building which is beautiful to look at. Accessibility is great with 3 lifts and low gradient ramps. There is disabled parking right by the entrance and the staff are friendly and very helpful. The cinema screens are all accessible with the facility to remove seating for wheelchairs. Screen 1 has a hearing loop and when speaking to the staff they said if there was demand they would look into audio description or BSL interpretation. The accessible toilet is a reasonable sized room with space to turn outside but more limited inside, it has an alarm cord but has no changing bed or hoist. Overall, The Station is a great place to go and spend time with plenty to do and eat!"
4377,"There is a Changing Places toilet and also 2 accessible toilets on the ground floor, see photo. They are in an area separate from the regular toilets. The accessible toilets require a radar key. They accessible toilet was spacious with grab rails and red emergency cord."
4378,All the staff were excellent and extremely helpful. On the way the brake cable on my chair snapped and we asked if there were any mechanics near by but the maintenance team at the hotel managed to fix it and were excellent.
4379,"Large Marks and Spencer store with clothing, food, homeware and a cafe. "
4380,"A 'miles without stiles' ramble. If you love being out in the wilds but need a structured route this is for you, anything from a pushed wheelchair to an off road scooter will cope with it. Don't be tempted to cross the grass from the car park as the route sugests, even my off road scooter struggled. Go up the road to the track. It's a full on ramble, you need to be aware of the weather and no public transport but it's worth the effort."
4381,The toilets had plenty of handrails and automated doors.
4382,All level access.
4383,"They were terrible: didn’t know which train was going to be where and they were constantly chatting about which platform it would be on. And when the train did actually arrive, they took so long to arrange the ramp onto the train and then bags had to be moved because they were blocking the disabled space on the train."
4384,We were able to park just outside entrance to our room.
4385,"The staff were welcoming and friendly and keen to be helpful in every possible way. Two stars lost for not understanding the use and function of the red emergency cord in the toilet, and for consequently putting people's safety at risk."
4386,"a Gravel drive from the road to the 'Lodge', with hard and level paving to designated disabled parking bay"
4387,Always very welcoming 
4388,The staff were pleasant if a little uninterested . There was no housekeeping staff for the entire 4 day Christmas period. There was no food available at all except breakfast  and they were obviously running on a skeleton staff.
4389,"Spacious, clean and adequate. A little bit dimly lit and tucked away at the back of the store, but perfectly fine."
4390,"I went by wheelchair taxi, but ample parking and several  dedicated accessible parking spaces near the door
The centre is on the main bus route to Dumfries Infirmary "
4391,"Clean, plenty of room, but not enough to turn the wheelchair round. "
4392,DLR Station Cutty Sark is step-free (so is the entire DLR network) and several bus routes serve Greenwich. Cutty Sark Station is just a few hundred yards from Café Rouge.
4393,Huge carpark at Pickering less than 200 metres from the station with drop off possible.  Whitby station car parking is limited but plenty available on the harbouring. Drop off possible but the ramp to the platforms may take some finding. From the carparks.
4394,Flat parking area next to apartments
4395,The local buses stop near by but I arrived by taxi and I had level access to the square.
4396,Parking for 2 cars directly outside the cabin on level tarmac with a gentle slope up to the entrance
4397,It's central and on Lothian Road so accessible via bus and a  short roll from the tram stop either Shandwick or Princes Street. There is now a drop curb just in front of it with perhaps a couple of centimeters in height which makes accessibility much better than it used to be. 
4398,"After you leave the car park you are guide to the wide path that goes down under the road you came in on.
The slope has this modern soft grip surface which is great for my scooter, but for someone with a manual scooter it's going to be very hard todo.
If there is someone controlling the scooter then fine, but just think of your weight going down and back up again..
When you get to the proper entrance to the garden national trust people go through, mere mortals have to pay £10 each no reduction for disabled.
When we were there they had long queues
Ok so you are in garden See anything els"
4399,A 5 star service to help you
4400,"The staff are friendly, cheerful and courteous. The manager has strange ideas about the need to tidy away the bar furniture at a certain time each evening (normally around 8pm), and applies his rule about this with a draconian and inflexible disregard for the needs of individual customers, so if you walk with a stick and have difficulties standing and need a high chair to sit level with your friends who are standing, you may have to argue with him.  Because of this strange lacuna in his otherwise cordial welcome, one star lost."
4401,There are a limited number of disabled bays outside the museum but plenty of public car parks with disabled bays close by.
4402,"There always seemed to be plenty of staff to greet you as you came through the door, and I noticed that a member of staff moved a few items of clothing to allow a person in a wheelchair to get through."
4403,"This was a visit to a community theatre based at Strode College in Street, Somerset to see 'A Man Called Ove' (definitely recommend this film as well as the venue).
This is a small but very professional and welcoming venue.  People were very friendly and helpful; it was a great night.  There is a small cafe-bar to enjoy before performances and very clean wheelchair accessible toilets on both floors as well as a lift.  Great view from the wheelchair spaces but the overall feeling of a small art-house theatre venue really adds to the experience and seems to embrace the full meaning of community.  The programming is amazing too and very varied from  dance, opera, tributes, world and mainstream cinema to conferences.  Thanks all staff for such a positive experience."
4404,"The venue, is really cool, nice bar stocked well with a good selection of beers. Very art school kind of hip.
The gig venue is upstairs, I asked if there was a lift and an accessible toilet.  The staff was very friendly, the lift had been switched off but they got somebody to come and to turn it back on, and they left it on for the reminder of the night.  The accessible toilet was down in the basement, though easy access to the lift was required.  The venue upstairs was extremely dark and it was hard to move around, as the gig was sold out. The gig and the atmosphere was amazing, I felt it could be a little more accessible, but the staff were very friendly.  
"
4405,"The waitress who met us was very friendly and helpful, and the staff were happy to book our table over the phone."
4406,The staff were friendly and helpful.
4407,Good parking and enteaces. Good to have the additional option of moving the car to museum so all options are available.
4408,"Wheelchair access at this museum is generally very good, but I encountered some annoyances with lifts and toilets."
4409,Straight in off the street. Lift and helpful staff. 
4410,"Access at rear, so you can't get into all of the areas but it's pretty good."
4411,Large car park with disabled bays.
4412,Very helpful and very friendly
4413,Friendly helpful and efficient 
4414,Very helpful and knowledgeable.
4415,Entrance has level access. There are two lightweight doors into pub. There is no lowered section at the till and some areas of seating have stairs. I didn't see any designated wheelchair accessible tables. Depending on your chair you could sit in the centre of table to avoid the legs. I had to raise my foot plates to fit. Payments can be paid using contactless. The lights are of a reasonable brightness and there is music playing. You order food and drinks at the bar. 
4416,It's a ruined cathedral designed long before wheelchairs but most of the ground floor is accessible. Covid safe with mirrors around dark corners and santiser available. Have to book in advance but we did that with the QR code outside the gate. 
4417,There are disabled toilets here
4418,"The café is next to a huge car park with ample spaces off Beach Drive. We parked nearer on Harbour Street almost road side using an end bay next to a kerb, parking far enough away to allow me to transfer into my chair. I couldn't see any marked disabled bays outside the café. There is a dropped kerb outside the entrance. The train station is about 1/2 a mile away at the end of Harbour Street.   "
4419,"This had been well thought through. There were one or two areas that I couldn't get to because of the multiple steps (e.g. The Chapter House), however in such a historic building I don't see how that could have improved the access."
4420,"Almost everything about the gym is wheelchair accessible, the one thing that isn't is the upstairs dance studio and some doors are a bit narrow but manageable. but other than that really good access."
4421,"There is a car park, but no Blue Badge parking, however it is possible to drop passengers close to either the front or rear entrance. On a bus route, but very irregular service."
4422,tolets are very spacious and easy to access.
4423,"A very interesting historic site that you can access easily with a wheelchair and assistance dog it can be accessed from both sides either Poachers Pocket all Chirk itself.  Chirk Aqueduct is a 70-foot (21 m) high and 710-foot (220 m) long, The foundation stone was laid on 17 June 1796 and it was completed in 1801.
The tow path is a very beautiful path about 2 miles before you get to the aqueduct and you have excellent views from the chair that's approaching from Poachers Pocket side. You can also see trains going over the aqueduct from the viaduct and do the busy line between Chester Wrexham Telford."
4424,"Level access into the shop, a lift to all floors, and just about enough space to squeeze between the display tables if you're a skilful wheelchair user. On today's visit I managed not to knock any books off tables or drag any tables along with me. A bit more space would be welcome for visits on my clumsier days."
4425,Despite this being an old building access was great with no problem getting around all areas.
4426,"All the buses were wheelchair accessible, they only had one disabled area though and if a wheelchair was on you needed to wait for the next bus, which were roughly every 15 minutes. As I have said as you are on the lower deck the view wasn't the best."
4427,"This venue makes traveling to the island of Tasmania just south of Australia worthwhile. Make it  memorable and sale the scenic route by catameran from Hobart harbour. A pier is available on the gallery side for anyone with restricted walking ability, to avoid the 80 steps cut into the cliff face.
Great views on arrival and from museum cafe. The gallery space is actually all underground. Descend in a lift or via a spiral staircase to the basement level and begin a journey through Art works displayed on 2 further levels via a series of ramps and bridges. The monumental entrance in the basement is impressive and I wasn't disappointed by the variety of Australian contemporary art displayed and the 'Museum of Everything' ( works created on the fringe of the established Art  world ).
With so much to see take a break in first floor cafe. Enjoy tasty dishes helpfully displayed on plates with prices for quick decisions. Also on offer local wines and beers. Eat outside in the terrace garden if weather permits. July is winter here but the sun shone and I sat outside.
Outside a short walk takes you to the Moorilla wine tasting experience and a further 2 restaurants which I do want to go back to try."
4428,"Apart from the parking this newly refurbished train station is a vast improvement on the old one. Flat access, bright and airy, disabled turn styles, large disabled toilets, lifts to all platforms and helpful staff. It's also very easy to navigate your way around."
4429,"I was pleasantly surprised about this. Despite the ancient building, there is step free access throughout almost all of the museum, achieved through lifts and ramps, and on occasion by a staff member taking you outside and back in through a private entrance. 

My partner had a vague memory of this museum from a previous visit as being full of steps and uneven surfaces, and we weren't really expecting for me to be able to visit the Roman streets excavated under the building, but that was no problem at all: there was a good lift down and you explore the streets via level walkways that float over the excavations. There were some rather tight corners on the walkways for my largish scooter, though, so I'd recommend taking a wheelchair or the smallest kind of scooter (i.e. the folding ones)."
4430,"The site is naturally hilly and some areas are quite difficult to access. There is an easier route which is clearly marked however it still includes some difficult areas. In addition there are some very steep paths to some exhibits, and a simply handrail all the way would have been useful. In addition, the smoking areas are all away from the easier access path. Yes smoking is bad for you, but disabled people smoke too! My husband had a couple of precarious trips to the designated smoking areas."
4431,The staff are brilliant and helpful in most of the places.
4432,"Unfortunately the venue is in a traffic free area  with no adjacent car parking, however there are car parks a short distance away. 
Not too far from both bus routes & stations."
4433,"Good parking, wheelchair friendly walk round the centre, fab café, dog friendly!"
4434,"Stunning surroundings and all the facilities we needed. It's hard to leave, and we'll definitely be back!"
4435,"Whilst staying in Washington DC we hired an adapted vehicle that was wheelchair accessible and drove over the Potomac river to Arlington Cemetery. The journey to the cemetery was not easy. Driving on the right side of the road and a lot of one way systems made it challenging but the main problem was the lack of signage to the cemetery. We must have crossed the Potomac several in our attempt to get to the cemetery.
We did finally get there. On arrival we inquired about disabled parking. There were plenty of disabled spaces.

There are other ways to travel to Arlington Cemetery including ....
The metro. The Arlington National Cemetery Station is located on the Metropolitan Washington D.C. Area Metrorail's Blue Line. 
There is also a Metrobus stop on Memorial Avenue. Information on the hours of operation, schedules and fares for the Metrorail and Metrobus are available on the WMATA website. 

Both are just a short walk from Arlington gates.

The welcome centre entrance can be accessed by a few stairs or a ramp which gives access to wheelchair users.

Arlington Cemetery is huge (approximately 624 acres). The sites of most interest are scattered throughout its 624 acres. To make the most of the day we payed to ride the hop on hop off guided tour trolley bus. The trolley buses where wheelchair accessible with 2 spaces with clamps and seatbelts for wheelchair users. The spaces were at the front behind the driver. To access the trolley bus there was a small pullout ramp. Unfortunately not all the trolley buses had working pullout ramps which meant that on some occasions we had wait extra time for a trolley bus with a functioning ramp. It was annoying.
We were lucky that our visit was on a bright and sunny day that was not disrupted by the rain. We managed to see almost everything we wanted including the JFK eternal flame (which was a little bit tricky to get to in a wheelchair). There were a few areas that were not accessible for wheelchair.
"
4436,Peace perfect peace.
4437,"Most things within the hotel are accessibile in a wheelchair. The only except is the hair salon. In normal times the staff would make another arrangement but we visited shortly after lockdown was lifted.
The signage to the Terrace Restaurant is tricky because it is signed the Brasserie. That's not such an issue if you can pop up and down stairs but felt a bit tedious till we worked it out.
The hotel have made great efforts to have the outdoor spaces accessible but there's a bit more work to do on that. Very welcoming, though, and one of the most accessible places we have stayed."
4438,One large toilet with required handled and space to turn wheelchair. Other toilets are available. Not five in score as shared toilet with baby change; but they have their needs too!
4439,"This Museum is a Grade 1 listed Georgian house, which is largely unaltered and so disability accommodations are difficult. Also, the house is in an old part of Bath and outside are flagstone pavements on a hill, which can be challenging! The primary guide takes the role of the main housekeeper and talks you through the daily routines and staff present in the house in C18th."
4440,A very nice bar that serves great food and friendly staff and very helpful.My wife is in a wheelchair and they will always move chairs or tables about to make space for her.
4441,Inside the bar is very accessible and with plenty of space BUT there is about a 20cm step at the front door.
4442,Everyone we spoke to was lovely and very happy to help. They showed a lot of passion for the company and the local area and made it a really memorable visit.
4443,If you don't mine a trek along a narrow footpath edged on either side by fences or hedges. The path has a fairly rough turf surface and climbs around 150 metres upward. I'm told you can't see the doocot from the path until you get to the top of the hill. Once at the top the doocot has been restored by the National Trust for Scotland. You can sit a while and enjoy the view of across the valley below. A battlefield plaque tells the story of the battle of 1645.
4444,Accessible toilets in store which was good.
4445,"To the room itself therew is normally only 2 steps and then further steps depending on how high you want to sit in the stands. I explained my needs to the staff and they got me a chair straightaway so I didn't have to stand and wait as there is normally about 20 minutes waiting time out side the venue and then they showed me the way up the ramp to avoid the steps. At the top of the ramp, the chair was waiting for me again and I got first admittance into the hall to chose the front row seats in my stand so that I didn't have to use any stairs there either. Incredibly beautiful and accessible building with lots of space. Other gripe I would have is there was a lose floorboard next to our seats which with lots of people walking over it shook our seats causing a flair in my chronic pain. Easily fixed though!"
4446,Staff by were courteous but didn't make any particular efforts to assist.
4447,The shaded carport adjacent to the accessible flat works very well.
4448,Excellent made everything so much less stressful really friendly and accommodating.
4449,"Step free with a great subway ramp to some platforms, step free to get out to the car park. Let down by accessible toilet and staff who forgot to get the ramp out to board."
4450,"One of very few level access tattoo studios in Edinburgh. The shop is spacious and comfortable, staff are wonderful and talented!"
4451,"Arriving from Belvedere Road, in the evening, it was not clear where the entrance was. There are lifts to all floors, however the signage is not clear and I had to ask a member of staff for directions. I used the Singing Lift and after the concert it was extremely busy and it took quite a time to get to the ground floor exit."
4452,Car parks quite close. Not easy by public transport from what I could see. 
4453,Council public accessible WC with grab rails.   There is a charge to use it and the door automatically opens after 20 minutes
4454,"The lower part of the house is accessible . The kitchen Wing is also accessible if you ask. They will take you in an alternative door. Otherwise you cannot get inas there are steps and a small space. 

The Carriage house is not accessible . 

The grounds are mostly accessible with compacted shingle paths. The rear of the house is not accessible."
4455,There's automated doors at the entrance. Then immediately in front of you is a staircase and a platform lift to take you to the main floor. There's large lifts to each floor and accessible toilets. 
4456,In the past customer service has been a bit slipshod. Tonight the woman staffing it took my complaint form straight up to management. 
4457,In a group with 3 disabled folk all had unsuitable rooms up steps too small to move around etc  Little understanding of the difficulty from staff  Wheelchair lift to restaurant level worked when it felt like it  and was anxiety inducing pre every meal . Restaurant had steps within it  rollator user had to be seated separately from rest of group Overall just not suitable for folks with mobility problems 
4458,"We found this attraction online via a search. Being from Scotland, we knew nothing of the local area, so read the accessibility information carefully. I’m sure it states somewhere on the website that the Submarine museum (fully accessible when you actually get to it) is not in Portsmouth, but it sure wasn’t on the tickets and attractions page where it tells you about the multi attraction day ticket, nor the accessibility page. Nor was all the access information available on the website, as we were handed another much more comprehensive document on arrival, but this was not a lot of use to us as if we’d read it before we came out for the day (2.5 hour drive) we would have concluded that “Don’t go, you cant see anything” was the upshot of the leaflet. The language on the website is also very archaic - accompanied by a carer, registered disabled - these terms went out with the ark. We were also told at various points that my “carer” was “required” to stay with me. I was sitting completely still in my wheelchair less than 10 feet from the emergency exit, what did they think could happen to me or anyone else which would require the specific assistance of a dedicated carer?

So we were told on arrival the submarine museum is across the water, you can get there by free boat without a wheelchair, but wheelchair users must drive around, then drive back, and it would take about 45 minutes each way. And if we came without a car?? I can’t imagine. So we crossed that off, then got told this you can see part of that you can get into bits of the other, this you can see a little of, the harbour tour doesn’t take electric chairs. On probing about this decision I’m told it’s because in an emergency they cannot be lifted. In a “boat is sinking” emergency the chair goes down with the ship! And they are not the only boat in the world, I go regularly on all kinds of boats which manage to take account of a powered wheelchair just fine, I don’t know what it is that these guys are not doing which makes them so different. The weight of the chair also isn’t so different from the weight of me, so I’m slightly concerned for my welfare if nobody can lift that sort of weight. I’d have brought a second wheelchair if I’d known that literally every attraction would require me to be in a manual chair, but it was the breezy way they kept saying I could transfer to a manual chair (if they had one available) then I could do stuff. Presumably they think powered mobility is some kind of fashion accessory that’s optional. Then we watched them permit on board a Tilt in Space manual - my powerchair is not heavier than one of those, as it happens. 

The trouble being that having travelled and paid, the people with you want to see everything, so you are stuck milling about next to a ship for 90 minutes after seeing the tiny bit that’s accessible, then you move to another attraction and you again see a corner of the ship and your family goes off exploring and comes back with exciting stories. 

We couldn’t get useful answers to our questions about the boat trip, we wanted to try to do the trip anyway with my husband lifting me on, so we asked how close we could get “oh, right next to the boat” they said - it’s a double rampway of about 20m with a right angle turn then a walk to the seating. And yes, when they said I could leave my powerchair on the dock,they really meant it! Loose on the dock. I asked if it would be secure and was told to take my belongings with me, and though I commented that I have no belonginngs anywhere close to as valuable as my powerchhair, they said nothing in reply. The boat trip (harbour tour) was lovely, though. 

All in all, a very expensive day of sitting on a dock waiting for my family (who both got free tickets after I paid!) to do things I couldn’t do. Don’t bother, or at least if you are interested, ask them to email you the FULL accessibility guide before you travel, it’s very differrent from the web version."
4459,"Free entrance. Suits anyone with walking impairment or wheelchair user. Easy access by car on Lisburn Dublin main Rd just outside Banbridge. Plenty of disabled car parking and easy flat surface from all spaces to gallery. Disabled toilets just at entrance large & fully equipped with houist. Lovely bright 1 room gallery with visiting contemporary national  exhibits often with links to locality & sculptor FE McWilliams. Wheelchair friendly sculpture garden & studio in grounds. Excellent cafe - friendly waitress served- homemade local produce , tomatoes soup & wheaten bread, battered fish & chips, crab salad, club sandwiches  good coffee & cakes. High standard tasty food medium priced. Small selection of craft/ gifts. "
4460,"The entire hotel is wheelchair friendly, easy to enter, move around, lively and with disability aware staff. "
4461,"Good access throughout the experience including an accessible barrel on the ride which kicks off the experience, audio guides are available too."
4462,"The main difficulty is getting from the car park to the ticket office - up a very steep and cobbled approach! The moat area and garden isn't accessible (though there's not much of it to access, to be fair). The ringed area to the front is largely visible without needing to get to it all, the rooms downstairs inside are superbly accessible as are the areas to the rear. Not a very large castle though so what there is doesn't take long to get round.  Interesting though and helpful staff."
4463,Plenty of parking available; would need own transport.
4464,Plenty of disabled spaces and can drop off at door too x
4465,"Helpful staff, particularly in the cafe."
4466,"The venue is level from the door in there is a large lift located just in front of the door if you want to go upstairs .  We did not use this area during this visit. 
There was room to move around in wheelchair to access area we wanted to go during our visit ."
4467,The Sealife Center at Lodmoor county park Weymouth has disabled access in most of the huts and has 2 disabled toilets and a tight gift shop to negotiate around.
4468,"There’s a very well-equipped accessible loo on level one of the museum. Grab rails round the loo, an approachable washbasin and everything within easy reach. Thre’s even some interesting tiling on the walls."
4469,"The staff are particularly attentive and recognising of specific or additional assistance, they offer open information on the sourcing of their produce, useful recipe and cooking ideas and have various offers available."
4470,There are number of disabled toilets located throughout the shopping centre which are clearly signposted and easy to access.
4471,Outside and in this is like the archetypal English church. And then you remember that you are in the heart of Kuala Lumpur! Located just off Independence Square (Detaran Merdeka) this has been a place of worship in this location since around 1890. It's all on one level and has step free access. We popped in for a quick visit so not to any of the services but it's well cared for and now one of Kuala Lumpur's most visited attractions. 
4472,plenty of space for wheelchairs to pass with easy to navigate isles when staff are filling shelves were happy to move stock to allow wheelchairs to pass
4473,"The entrance/exit is a button-operated automatic door, up a small ramp. There is a fair amount of space to move around on the lower floor, and the tables are a good height for wheelchair access. The fridge is also at a good height, although the counter is a little high. There is additional seating, but it's up a flight of stairs"
4474,"New, clean accessible toilet. Fairly big and usual rails etc, but not a full changing places toilet. 
Red emergency cord.  "
4475,The complex and venue car park are all access friendly so no complaints
4476,"I called in for a sandwich this morning and was pleasantly surprised to see how they cater for a wheelchair user. Very easy to get in from the car park and once inside they have a disabled toilet.
Really my only issue is that if the cafe was busy then a wheelchair user would not be able to access the loo as furniture would have to be moved. Overall it is a very good standard as cafes go.
There are 2 disabled bays about 20 metres away and although the car park was half full, I am pleased to say that the spaces were not being abused. This could be due to a sign which says that the car park is monitored by electronic surveillance.
It is purely with the furniture moving issue that I gave the place 4 stars and not 5. When ever I am in the area again, I will make a point of calling in."
4477,The staff were particularly helpful and many thanks to the check out lady who packed my bags!
4478,All the right features and the cord was ok. Again limited by including baby change. Nappy and sanitary bins in side transfer space. 
4479,"First Newcastle Falcons game at Newcastle Uniteds ground. Friendly helpful stewarding, easy to move around the concourse, overall a good experience."
4480,"Great point to stop off for a picnic, stroll or even just a loo stop. There is a small Cabin here too to get a drink. Decent sized and clean accessible loo. There is free parking for Blue Badge holders. And - the main attraction - the Loch is accessible from the car park. It's sort of level access with a few bumps... And a kind of dirt path to the water's edge."
4481,The accessible toilet was well appointed and would be spacious. Due to its use as a baby changing facility and a portable changing bench block access it was not accessible to me.
4482,Access around the main part of the gardens is good with tarmac paths to most points. As you move toward the northern side (toward Princes Street) the ground goes uphill and the paths are not really suited for wheelchair access. The exits to Princes Street are too steep for safe access.
4483,The access to the accessible toilet was along a corridor with a ninety degree turn to go in the door. It was clean and tidy but not the easiest to move around in with a powerchair. Signage was not immediately obvious.
4484,Visited this auditorium for lunch while on holiday in Lewis for a few days. Level access from outside into the foyer where there is a small shop area. A lift then takes you up to the cafe. Well worth a visit & the food was good too.
4485,"Given that the tall ship was moored on the river and is a boat, access for me as a power chair user was excellent."
4486,"One star for the very helpful member of staff who tried to assist me. But zero stars for the management of the Paul chain, and of this branch in particular, for ignoring their legal obligations to provide access to disabled people. Disgraceful!"
4487,The disabled parking is just across the road from the theatre and fortunately there were spaces available.
4488,The owners really look after guests and are always available when we've needed them. They maintain the cottages so well that we hardly needed anything sorting.
4489,The glampsite wardens were very helpful and explained fully how everything worked when we arrived. They were very quick to respond to requests etc.
4490,"Wheelchair accessible, reasonably priced food, staff extremely helpful, nothing was too much trouble"
4491,"There is parking available quite near to station, but expensive, and there are a number of car parks for the NEC with park and ride facilities, this way being cheaper, and of course you will be dropped off at the hall you will be visiting.
We chose to arrive by train however, a more comfortable way to arrive, but then, there is quite a long way for your carer to have to push your wheelchair."
4492,Car park next to venue very reasonable 
4493,Level access and just enough room to manoeuvre around.
4494,Step free access to this small but interesting zoo. Lots of the paths are just compacted earth so can be a bit muddy but well worth a visit.
4495,"When we arrived we realised my wheels were flat! My friend went in to ask if they had wheelchairs but they didn’t. We back home to get the pump. Back at the venue! 
I had a lovely evening, I was in my manual chair and struggled to move about myself because of the carpets. The staff were friendly, food was good, temperature was on the colder side and the fire wasn’t on but it wasn’t uncomfortable."
4496,Adjacent to bus station. Car park across the street. 
4497,"The doors into the museum are electric, the whole area is wide and flat, with lifts to other floors. There is plenty of space everywhere."
4498,"I have put 3 stars as mentioned is it is not wheelchair accessible. It suits me and my family, as they all want to be close to the blue flag beaches."
4499,"I'm not overly sure if they offer braille guides, but everything is well signposted. The only downside I'd say is the fact that the film is too loud for certain people and  there's no BSL"
4500,"We stayed (2 disabled 1 wheelchair user) at the hotel for an event in, but not near the hotel.
After a tiresome train journey the staff were helpful in checking in.
The room was on the ground floor, fairly near reception and the restaurant.
I requested an extra set of towels, for a shower, and milk for tea, and reported a missing light fitting.
The wet room was fine, but the toilet situated far too close to the sink.  Anyone with large build would have trouble or severely disabled would have trouble using the toilet in that room.
Also being near the reception we did occasionally get wafts of smokers coming in when the windows were open.
Unless you have a car, food is in the bar and restaurant. There are other places to eat across a dual carriageway, which we navigated in the chair/on foot on the first night.  No info was offered on local transport.
Food, we ate in the hotel the second night, was fine, and the self service breakfast bar (similar to that of a Premier Inn) was fine.
A good hotel, and very helpful staff, however I'd expect better with the layout of an accessible room. I wouldn't stay again unless they redesign the wet room!"
4501,Easy to get in and around the shop and restaurant
4502,"There is level access from the main street, with no steps involved. There is a pole in the middle of the shop floor, but this is clearly marked by black and yellow wrapping, so it stands out to customers. The shop has a large sign above the door in a clear font stating that it is a bakery. There is also a sign protruding from the wall, so that people can see it from a distance."
4503,Back lane access and a few parking spots there.
4504,"Took my wife in her wheelchair and accessed the bar area via the in-house microbrewery accompanied by the bar tender. Disabled toilet also easily accessed.
A brilliant bar with excellent cask ales brewed on site.
Dog and family friendly.
Highly recommended"
4505,"There is disabled parking bays directly outside of the museum entrance, however these are public parking spaces also used by  members of the public who do not use the museum, this increases the risk there not being a disabled bay available on arrival."
4506,The hotel is ideally placed for the various forms of public transport that pass along Princes Street; including the many buses and the trams.
4507,There is a small lip into the cafe which has been dealt with by attaching a small ramp that ties in with the decking elsewhere. There is a dropped counter inside at the till as well. Outside there are various low picnic benches and then lots of spaces to picnic throughout the Helix park where this cafe can be found.
4508,"The entrance to the shop is step-free and there is an adequate lift to all floors.

Getting around inside the bookshop is a nightmare for wheelchair users. The display tables are enormous, too close to each other, and too close to the bookshelves. There's no room for a wheelchair user to squeeze through the resulting tiny gaps. It's impossible for wheelchair users to get to most areas of the bookshop. 

There was a gigantic display table outside the lift on the 1st floor. I was not able to get past it. I was stuck between the lift and the table! Shocking negligence by management and staff! See my pictures below.

Two side rooms can be reached only by a small flight of steps and are inaccessible to wheelchair users. No ramp provision for these rooms. See my picture below of these steps."
4509,Disabled parking is available by the West Gate and the John Hope Gateway. Accessible buses pass by the East Gate.
4510,This is a wheelchair accessible sports venue in the heart of Aberdeen. It has level access with accessible parking and lift access to all sporting areas.
4511,"No dedicated car park, but disabled parking bays are available within a 1 mile radius.
There are several nearby bus stops, including the bus station, and the train station is not far too."
4512,"Pretty good - all level on ground floor and theres a lift to other floors. Only issue is the lift might not be deep enough for some wheelchair users. The lift at the back of the store.
The cafe itself doesn't have a lowered counter but staff were very happy to help. Tables and chairs can be moved."
4513,"the wyvern theatre has nearly daily shows throughout the year and working in a care home for adults with physical disabilities aged 18? i book tickets in bulk, there is 4 seats in the front row for the complementary carer tickets and each wheelchair user sits next to the carer, there is also room for 2 more wheelchair uses in the box upstairs, we have seen pantos, live music, dramas, school plays, ice shows , circus acts, and 60s, 70s, and 80s music and magicians, comedians, our residents have always been made welcome, the only downside if a resident wants to buy souvenir or mementos it is upstairs and i have to go there to get them, but if the audience stands and dances they are not in front of our residents and they can still see, this can not be sid in all theatres"
4514,"Only two disabled car spaces in a busy car park but one was free so we were ok. Lovely gift shop, great food (huge portions) and easy access throughout.

There's also access to the old train line, now a cycle path, on which to push a wheelchair for a breath of fresh air before lunch.

We'll be back!"
4515,"The hotel is in a busy street not too far from Haymarket railway station (300 metres). There’s limited parking in the area.

If you are arriving from the airport or on the train, it’s a good spot. The hotel is a short distance from the train station, tram stop and bus interchange.

Taxis can drop at the door and there are plenty of taxis at the nearby rank at the station."
4516,"As I did not have the need to try these out, I cannot really comment on how functional they were.  However, I did see quite a number of public ones.  On the front there are a number of hotels which, I am sure, would allow people to use theirs."
4517,Lots of car parking but if the disabled bays are full you can be far enough away from the entrance for it to be quite a walk. The car parks nearest the zoo are paved but there is grass overflow parking. 
4518,It's a traditional pier with an amusement and entertainment complex at the shore end. You can go in and explore but steps at the rear mean you cannot proceed on to the main pier. You have to back track and use a ramp at the side of the building which takes you up on to the pier. Once on the main pier watch out for the gaps in the planking as it's easy to catch a wheel of your chair in the slot. We were able to walk and wheel to the end of the pier. You have to negotiate the array of amusement rides and kiosks.
4519,"A fantastic place to stay, beech cottage may look small from the outside, but inside the cottage is very well laid out and very well equipped. The welcome from the owner is lovely and you are made to feel at home. If you are looking for a beautiful place to stay with great views and a relaxing feeling this is the place to stay. There is quite a collection of booklets for things to do, walks etc.  It really is a very special place."
4520,"This Post Office has wide, press button operated door with flat entrance and although is 'full' of racks with cards etc, I am able to access in & turn round in my large Pride Mobility Scooter.
The racks etc might be a visual overstimulation challenge for eg  autism or some visual impairments, but no more than many other small independent stores. 
Although the roped queue system to main tills is tricky, the staff are very keen to help and will either open the side till or come & take goods & money from you.
There is a small amount of off road parking and (although road can get busy) street parking too ..it is on a bus route and there is a pedestrian crossing  nearby.
The staff are very keen to assist and with a large elderly customer base, I've witnessed staff be very patient and helpful with the challenges transactions can offer.
They have a dedicated Facebook Page & have an outdoor cash point, offer full PO services & have photo booth"
4521,"Easy access on mobility scooter, plenty of space, lift to all floors, friendly, helpful staff."
4522,The accessible loo was very easy to find and was also pointed out to us by the venue staff on our arrival. It was clean and tidy.
4523,The outside of the castle was very accessible for with flat surfaces. The castle itself did have one lift which had to be accessed through the kitchen which I think sounds quite dangerous especially when the kitchen is in use. There was only one lift in the whole castle.
4524,The one member of staff I I saw stated that she would 'tell the manager' that the website needs changing to remove the 'disabled accessible' statement. 
4525,All the pavements to the entrance of the station are lowered to make it more accessible for wheelchair users. There are also a number of zebra crossings to make it easier and safer to cross the road as the station traffic gets busy. When inside the station there are no steps on the platform. There are also lifts and a subways to access all platforms opposed to using the stairs and bridge. Although there could be more signs to make locating the subway easier.
4526,"Very good service for visitors to the shopping centre, restaurants and integral cinema but somewhat let down by toilet facilities if you are a motorised scooter user but overall a good place to go if you are disabled as plenty of parking spaces and terrific service of bringing one of the centres motorised scooters, electric wheelchairs or ordinary wheelchairs which they bring to your car once you have registered with the centre. The first time you want to use this service you have to go to the customer service desk on the ground floor and register.  You need to take a proof of address with you"
4527,"Fantastic accommodation,  easy to access,  lots of room, fab kitchen and cooking facilities with adapted sink/hob that is height adjustable.  All set in a peaceful country location."
4528,Whichever car park you use you will either go down a slope or up one.
4529,"The main trails are very good for using with a powerchair. Those which might be too steep are highlighted in the trail booklet and on signs. The numbering system could be better and we recommended they use colour coding. The staff were receptive to suggestions, well informed, friendly and happy.
The shop and cafe are first rate and easy to negotiate (room for many cyclists, walkers and my powerchair).  We had some excellent food served by friendly, happy people. The toilet was easy to negotiate, clean and spacious - no nonsense.
The views over Derwentwater are fantastic and we loved hearing the wind through the treetops."
4530,"The safari was good in that it had an' off road path' and a smooth ride drive through. Inside the park I drove around fine - but the lemur woodland walk through has bumpy paths and hills - but no problem for my power chair. The rest of the park was fine to see things and get around. A large distance to walk from the front animal area, through the leisure/fairground area to the final animal sector (smooth but long and a hill in the middle). I could see all the animals clearly and the lighting was good - even in the bat cave! Best safari I have been on."
4531,There is step free access to the front of the hotel. It has automatic doors. There is lift access to the different floors.
4532,"Ramped up to entrance, from there it's all on one floor with level access, but the size of the aisles really lets it down."
4533,"Nice, willing to advice us and help if needed."
4534,Accessible parking is available 
4535,Absolutely brilliant vey attentive
4536,Accessible toilet was easy to negotiate & was nice & clean. Suitable grab rails & emergency cord in place. Plenty of room to move around in a wheelchair & to transfer.
4537,"The cafe can be accessed by using a different ramps within the development, but it is a nice trip! 

There is no lib on door, the cafe is mostly made of high tables which can be annoying, but outside they had lower tables. "
4538,"Good sized disabled toilet, contained changing table for babies which considering this venue is super popular with families might lead to a queue"
4539,Well thought through 
4540,Friendly and helpful
4541,"As a blind traveller I am not going to get so much out of looking at the animals, I was there for the family. They did have some paw prints to feel and I enjoyed the sky train.
The shuttle buses and sky train would help to minimise the walking if you have mobility difficulties, I would still say a fair amount of walking is required.Pathways were good quality, but there was some quite steep hills.
I believe wheelchairs could be put on the shuttles, but I am not sure the skytrain would be able to accommodate these.
"
4542,The toilet is inside a large shower room. It is a normal toilet with no grab rails provided. Clean.
4543,Steep ramps but everywhere was accessible. 
4544,There is a car park but no designated disabled bays. There is a bus stop that stops outside (i4 and indigo Trent Barton Buses) stop here. The bus stop on the other side is a 5 or so minute walk away.
4545,"We arrived by Metro, the stop is a street away. The Metro in Bilbao is fully accessible with lifts to every station however signage to the stations was not always the best. I did find that the large gap between the metro train and the platform meant that I required a companion to help me on and off the train though so I would not be able to use it independently personally. "
4546,Operated by Radar Key. Very clean and spacious inside 
4547,There was no signage but there was a steward who guided you to your seat without any problems.  
4548,"Very nearly full marks. Wheelchair access into and throughout the museum. A platform lift to the mezzanine level felt shaky and ramshackle, as though it might break down any time. The lift to the upper floor was good. 
A virtual video tour of the real canal boat is provided for those who can't get inside it - very thoughtful!
The permanently running films have subtitles for the hearing impaired.
Braille notices direct visually impaired users to audio content on numerous topics about the canals (see my photo)"
4549,"The main doors do have two steps which are quite high, but on the right  side there is a small door which is a disabled friendly entrance with no steps it has a ramp into a corridor that has a door at about 5 meters that accesses into the front hall. There are lifts to each floor. We were shown to the lift by gentleman working there waited until we had alighted the lift.
They were really kind people, all helpful and willing to help."
4550,There are accessible toilets by the bar as well as standard toilet facilities.
4551,"Nice little cafe, with great breakfasts and lunches. Can be very busy, but orders come out quickly. Staff friendly and helpful. There is flat access from the street and within the cafe. Despite lots of tables, I was able to move around easily in my self propelled chair. There is a disabled toilet round the back. There is one tight corner, leading from the cafe, into the corridor, made worse by things being stored there. However, staff were quick to move things. "
4552,The soft play area is based on a smooth flat land. There are a lot of seating options available either at the front middle or back of the centre. Seating can be adjusted with the assistance of staff.
4553,Plenty of disabled spaces - two at the front and 4 on side
4554,As you go in the door you enter in to the NISA area of the store the aisle that was facing the door at two display stands in the middle of the aisle about 20 feet apart. This does not leave much room. There were also items being displayed at the end of some of the aisles including the one to access the Post Office Counter. There is a large post box at the start of the Post Office once you pass this it is set out to allow people to queue up at busy periods
4555,Although there was blue badge parking it would be better if there were a couple more spaces. There was a big sign stating that misuse of blue badge spaces would result in a fine. We drove and I imagine it would be tricky to get there using public transport.
4556,"Step free, smooth floors. Shops obviously differ, but a special mention is given to John Lewis. Lovely, wide aisles and two (yes, two) accessible toilets, which don't infanticise you by putting you in with the baby changing facilities."
4557,Most of the residents in Schagen speak English and are willing to answer your questions.
4558,"The Odeon in Dundee has had an upgrade and it's awesome! So I thought I would do another review of it. I wasn't sure if it would be much better, but it really is!"
4559,We arrived by ships tender. There is a car park close by. The railway station is just above the Marina but Villefranche is very hilly with lots of steps. 
4560,"They were cheerful, friendly and could not have been more helpful.
We were able to book the scooter in advance, and it was ready for us when we returned a couple of days later. Scooter hire is free and although the present scooter is robust enough to cope with the trail conditions there Are plans to acquire a Tramper , which will be even better."
4561,"There were disabled toilets throughout the hotel, including next to all the pool areas. The bathroom in the adapted room was also spacious and had a shower seat."
4562,"We only met the owner. As we were self catering and hired the whole house.
A lovely touch was some flowers and a card for my daughter who's 21st birthday we were celebrating there "
4563,"I think it's a few hundred yards from the bus route, not sure, but disabled parking is fine"
4564,"Getting into the Visitor Centre was through the wheelchair accessible entrance adjacent to the main rotating door. Doors were propped open due to Coronavirus precautions and our route marked with guide ropes so we had to pass by the temperature check and hand sanitiser station. Once inside we were at the welcome desk and from here during out visit we explored the shop, the guided tour, the bar area and of course the loos. 

Moving around was easy as everything was signposted and very helpful staff pointed out the way too. The floors were well contrasted and routes easy to follow. My pal liked it too as the surfaces were smooth and easy to wheel over.

The visit included some interactive sessions when we went on the tour and these were all easily accessible. I particularly liked the sensory experiences as we got to smell the flavours involved in the whisky production, the smell of casks, as well as the noises of the grain milling too. 

Our tour guide, Gavin, was especially good at making sure we were aware of anything unusual as we moved around. He helped my pal with the lift, told me about low beams, and posting out things as we went around. A small section of the tour was upstairs but we didn't really notice that as we were shown those exhibits on an iPad with the accompany story. In some ways that was better as I could see the images close up, my pad got to see too, and we were both engaged and involved. 

There are several areas involved in the tour and you do move between the newer and older buildings. We were able to see and explore everything as we went along which was great as not all distilleries offer what we would describe as the full 'production' tour if you have access requirements.

The tasting session in one of the tasting rooms was a highlight. Particularly so for the great lighting so I could see everything. The clever way of placing the tasting glasses on a wooden platter with brass labels - whilst I couldn't read anything I felt included as I could easily identify the glasses from their position on the wooden board. My pal liked the tasting room too as we sat at a table which was an ideal height for him as wheelchair user.

Our tour finished and as with all good visits we ended up in the bar area! A great spacious and friendly area with amazing views over the garden below.

The distillery is on different levels and there are lifts to take you between floors. These were spacious, modern and spotlessly clean too.

For a visit that was accessible, felt friendly and gave us confidence in this difficult time of Coronavirus we both felt it worth of five stars! 

"
4565,"Ramps to get in all on the level doors are wide lifts within hotel , rooms are ok but could be improvements made in lay out, cannot easily get wheelchair on balcony easily"
4566,"Parking is ok, there’s enough spaces, but no real disabled bays, it’s just take your chance how close to entrance you can get."
4567,We wandered in from the Mall and easy to find. Not sure about parking nearby.
4568,"Some staff were helpful, others not so. Depends who is on duty.
"
4569,"Step free entrance, double doors allow easier entrance. This is a small venue so they don’t have as much space as other places. I was able to set up at the front of the stage in my wheelchair for a good view. This might not work for others, but I really enjoyed it. 

There is an upstairs gallery for people who want a seat, but not sure there is a lift for this. My PA went to the bar for me, and there weren’t lowered counters, but staff were lovely so could help and make sure you get what you want. "
4570,"although meter parking close by it is occupied.  we parked St Enoch's which is close by and accessible    approx 300 yards away
"
4571,"I suffer from a form of Motor Neurone Disease which does not affect my speech but does make it difficult to walk more than a few paces even with crutches.  I rely on my mobility scooter and wheelchair.  I live in the ancient market town of Sedbergh in Cumbria.  Old buildings and narrow pavements make access to most premises almost impossible.  However, The White Hart Club of which I am a member is a big enough premises to convert the entrance in order to provide a wheelchair stair lift.  I proposed the idea to the committee who initially rejected it.  It was considered to be a lot of expense for the limited number of people who would need it.  I sent a carefully worded letter pointing out their legal obligation under the 2010 Equality Act.  The committee responded to this in a positive manner and invited a consultant to visit the club to advise on the way forward.  It is now agreed that the alterations will be made and work will begin as soon as a suitable contractor can be found.  A good result !  The White Hart is a members club, but if anyone with a disability (and carers) plans to visit Sedbergh in this beautiful part of the country I will be happy to have you signed in as a guest.  You won`t get into the pubs and so if you fancy a beer the White Hart will soon be the place."
4572,King's Cross underground station serves both King's Cross and St Pancras International railway stations. There are several bus routes that stop outside.
4573,"Level access in via double doors. Decent amount of room inside to get about and see what's on offer. 
Large accessible loo at the back of the shop."
4574,"Staff appear to be well trained in supporting people with diverse needs, as the West Yorkshire Playhouse also runs showings for people with dementia and different access needs. 

Very friendly and happy to help."
4575,"The front desk staff were polite but seemed quite understaffed.

We had a drink in the bar. The bar itself is down four stairs and table service is advertised. We struggled to get table service and I had to go to the bar to order. Our drinks were a while in arriving. "
4576,"Well if you go on match day it is very busy! However if you ask a steward for assistance to your place they will happily do this! 
The walkways are very wide, stewards walk ahead clearing the way and of course the Welsh are super friendly and will help where they can! 
I found that the rugby game position was good. I was on the back row, on a metal platform with plenty of room marked out for my scooter and also a companion seat next to me. It was raised slightly so could see the game and also found there were TVs all along the room to watch and two large screens.

The staff also happily helped me out by taking my battery to get charged when I handed them the cable, this was extremely helpful!! 
A great place to go and extremely friendly people."
4577,"Good paths on the whole, not all of which are surfaced or suitable for wheelchairs. Good online maps are available though which give details of paths. Main route round big pond is mostly OK but not entirely level, and has a few quite steep-ish slopes, which my husband struggled to get me up in manual chair, but we did manage in the end! A few lumpy tree roots to avoid, a few small potholes in places and one or two of the wheelchair bridges have a bit of bump or edge to get on/off, and one of the hides had a ledge/sill across the doorway which we could not cross. But a beautiful place, and very peaceful. Lots of flora and fauna to see. Quiet today, with just a few dog walkers. "
4578,It's fairly easy to get around as the majority of the site is connected by tarmac or concrete roads or paths. I found it quite easy to wheel around. The buildings were all wheelchair accessible and the larger buildings had automated doors. The smaller ones might be tricky but I struck lucky in that staff were quick to offer help in opening and holding doors. The map was good and it was easy to see which way you had to go. Once inside the various exhibit halls and buildings it was easy to move around and see most things. One hall had a really good viewing platform that allowed you to see over the aircraft and it has a good sized lift to get up to the platform. Some areas had interactive exhibits and I found these easy to access and use - even a flight simulator!
4579,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately away near Waitrose on Link Rd approximately 150m away. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
4580,"There are only 2 disabled spots so more would be better but it is a big car park so not generally a problem to park, although we walk as its local.the car park is right next to the pub and all on one level to get in. The pub is on a main road at he front but the access is from the back a bus stops at the front."
4581,Double yellow lines all around the bar. Car park behind which is free for blue badge holders 
4582,Limited due to it being a very small converted station waiting room on a platform however they’ve done their absolute best and made use of the facilities. 
4583,On site car park. Disability ramp at rear. Disability toilet.
4584,There are blue badge parking spaces available in front of store doors. There is also other parking across the three shops. Buses stop at the beginning of the road on the way to and from the hospital. The road/path from the main road to the stores is quite a steep decline and the car park gets busy so I would suggest taking extra caution if coming this way.
4585,"Please see the main review for accessibility information.

As I normally prefer standard rooms I have only used the wheelchair accessible room once.  I found this difficult to navigate and walked into furniture and fittings several times due to the confined space and low heights above the floor.  The lighting in the bathroom was also not as bright as in the standard rooms.  I believe that someone using a wheelchair may require one of the twin beds to be removed in order to facilitate access."
4586,Some parking bays now have bollards preventing access to people like myself from using them because you can’t get off onto the pavements!
4587,"Ramp, automatic doors."
4588,"The whole venue is wheelchair accessible, every stage has a wheelchair accessible option. An informative and fascinating place to visit. Whether you have and active interest in aircraft or naval history or not. There is a lovely viewing gallery where you can sit and watch the active airfield if you find the whole thing is tiring. Adjecent to it is a nice cafe, serving good food and good portions! "
4589,"If you want to explore the town there are as usual a fair percentage of places with steps and some of the streets are very steep, I have a powerchair so not a problem. People in general were very good about giving way and there were not large numbers of shop stands on the pavements. We had a good day."
4590,Parked outside. Parking for rest of family.
4591,"Toilets were easy to find as there are signs, there are 3 altogether. The disabled toilets have plenty of turning space in them with grab rails and room for a carer."
4592,"Stadium is flat entry and separate entrance into the ground, all staff are happy to show everyone where to go."
4593,"Fantastic for all forms of disabled people, mostly flat lift  where needed and very interesting"
4594,There simply isn't any parking nearby. You could arrive on a bus as there's a stop nearby. It's best suited to just rolling up on foot; well wheels actually.
4595,The staff are all adorably friendly and bend over backwards to be helpful. They made our visit a really happy and relaxing experience.
4596,generally there is reasonable access throughout the store
4597,Distillery tours was 100% accessible if you can manage a gravel carpark. Staff keen to help. 
4598,Everyone we met was very helpful and willing to try to understand my English 
4599,"There was a broad ramp down to pitch level but no  signage and disabled seating was tacked on, in front of the stand like an afterthought."
4600,Entry is through doors which staff arrange to be opened. It is all level inside to the spectator areas. There are designated areas for wheelchairs and seats for carers. The bar and food area are accessable
4601,"There is a dedicated Blue Badge car park. A special bus service, the number 98 runs from St Andrew Square in the city centre out to the show and is wheelchair accessible"
4602,"I don't know about parking as I don't drive, but there were bus stops within a 2-minute walk of the location and a train station (Southampton Central - or 'So Proud Central' as it was called that day) less than a 10-minute walk away. It's worth a shout-out to Southampton City Council here, all busses had a fully functioning audible announcement function on board, meaning that I knew exactly where I was and I knew exactly when my stop was coming up. Southampton is the first city I've seen this work well in. "
4603,"From the disabled parking space to lunch at the Cafe Llaneraeron is a lovely accessible day out. The staff/volunteers are all very friendly the house has a ramp which can be put out and although upstairs was not accessible to me as I was using my mobility scooter I was allowed to go around the ground floor on my scooter. The path around the lake and walled garden was well maintained chippings and although I was on my scooter on this visit my wife has pushed me around in a manual wheelchair easily in the past. There are 3 large well appointed disabled toilets which I road into on my scooter...the door on one of them was quite heavy and needed alittle assistance from my wife to hold it open. The gift shop and coffee shop was accessible on my scooter but on this occasion we chose to sit outside. There are chairs and tables outside the cafe and picnic benches with wheelchair accessible gaps if you prefer to sit on the lawn...great if you have a dog. Although we went into the cafe to order, the food and drinks were brought to the table. "
4604,We couldn’t fault the parking as we were able to park alongside the Abbey Church and adjacent to the Abbey and Palace using our Blue Badge. There were also some on street parking bays. It’s not too far to walk from there to see the Carnegie Birthplace Museum as well as the new Carnigie Libarary and Galleries.
4605,"A wheelchair accessible route all around the park.  Staff were around (if you need assistance go to No 3 Cottage where they are based, though they are often out in the grounds).  Disabled toilet available also"
4606,Me and my friend went to ocean terminal for a girly shopping spree. Her pushing me in my wheelchair. We both found it totally assessable. My mum took my two sisters one of whom is also in a wheelchair to Maddie and marks the soft play. The soft play was also very assessable. Then we all when to zizzi's for dinner and the staff where very nice and showed me and my friend the assessable ramp to get to the next floor. All in all I had a fabby day.
4607,"Have a look at the website and you will see under the section Tickets and Pricing that there are concessions which is great, what is not great is that ALL disabled visitors are classed as having ""special needs"". this is not PC. Special needs is a shortened version of Special educational needs and relates to students. As a physically disabled visitor i was offended. 
Not all of the paths are suitable for wheelchairs or those who are unsteady on their feet, some of the hedges around enclosures are too high to see over, some of the doors aren't DDA compliant, steps aren't highlighted ."
4608,Entire building was on one floor. Resturaunt and room accessable
4609,The retail park is fully wheelchair accessible.
4610,"The access road is quite steep because of the location but once on the level there is an abundance of parking spaces on level ground adjoining the units. We ate out most evenings and would recommend the food (especially the seafood) at The Ship Inn, Elie; the 19th Hole, Earlsferry; The Crusoe Hotel, Lower Largo; The Upper Largo Hotel; and the Old Manor, Lundin Links. We did not need to use a disabled toilet at any of these hotels, so please check beforehand if one is required.  The Fishing Museum in Anstruther is well worth a visit and 90% wheelchair accessible and the café food good."
4611,"The staff are great and are willing to help always, there main priority it for you to have a wonderful time."
4612,No changing places toilets at the dock but on board ship you have wheelchair accessible rooms and bathrooms
4613,Very pleasant and knowledgeable
4614,Red cords in all toilets ties/cut at shoulder height when standing. Red cor cards left.
4615,Not a reliable lift which is a shame but there is a staff lift only for wheelchair users 
4616,"We asked for a disabled room, but was advised it did not have a view of the harbour and only a tub no shower. Other rooms with a view are not easy for wheelchairs as they are narrower doors, access to toilet was not very easy, the showers were cubicle, therefore I had sit on toilet and washed from the sink. I did ask for plastic chair for the shower, but none available."
4617,"To see gardens you will need to go around to the rear of the hotel, so we have dropped the stars a little for this reason. 
It’s all on the level, with an easy enough push for your carer, and you won’t really have to worry about going over the chippings to reach flower beds, you can see well enough along the paths."
4618,"The actors in the experience we’re not at all phased by me being in a scooter, so it was not a problem.
Apart from when I was too slow turning around in a tight corner and nearly drive into the cyberman invasion!!"
4619,"The main entrance doors are automatic so this enables people to gain access without having to open them doors them selves. However gaining access into a screen may be difficult for some users if they are alone, as the screens have big heavy fireproof doors that need to be pushed / pulled open."
4620,Staff were friendly and welcoming. I raised with staff that the emergency cord was short and asked her to follow this up. On this occasion I didn't require assistance but previously staff have been helpful when I've needed help with carrying my tray.
4621,"The staff at the restaurants were very welcoming and helpful. Although busy, service was prompt."
4622,"As a multi site visitor attraction There are several parts to visit. The Burns cottage is quite a distance from the visitor centre but well worth making the effort. You can also visit the Old Kirk, the Bridge and the Monument. The main visitor centre hosts the shop, cafe, exhibition and playwark."
4623,"The rating would be five stars but for the difficulties I encountered with the box office. The building itself is accessible and the standard of the music making is outstanding. Because of this and the limited number of wheelchair spaces, you need to book well in advance (I.e. months, not weeks). It is not possible to book wheelchair places on-line or by email but the telephone booking line offers the option of speaking with someone who speaks English. I had an exchange of emails with the box office and emailed them a PDF of documents (with translation into German) proving that wife is a wheelchair user. They said that these were acceptable but when I phoned to book tickets I was told that they were not & that we would have to pay full price."
4624,"The parking is on level ground, sometimes on grassland, and both have easy enough paths to allow you to be pushed along by your Carer. It’s only the gardens you can view, but worth your effort."
4625,The staff are friendly and helpful
4626,"Accessible changing areas are large and include hoists and cot, toilet and extra seat. Plenty of space to get changed alone or with the help of a carer."
4627,"Completely accessible wetroom
With large bath shower , shower chair and hoist"
4628,"I was made to feel welcome as soon as I entered.
I was a little later arriving than others in my group, and staff were very helpful in directing me to where they were and making sure I found them.

Staff were attentive and keen to cater for any needs people may have. "
4629,Abergavenny market hosts many important community events foremost of which is the Abergavenny Food Festival. There is no obstacle (that we could see) to people with mobility impairments being able to enjoy all events to the same extent as everyone else.
4630,"On arrival there are revolving doors and push button doors. At the moment the push buttom doors are being used by everyone. The building is entirely step free. There are 4 lifts to access all the floors. Where there are desks there are also lower level desk sections. However now some of the desks are roped off in front to maintain social distance, it means for me that also means I can now longer rest against the desk while I am being served. "
4631,Very helpful and knowledgeable which makes you feel at ease.
4632,"The main paths of the Park are accessible for wheelchairs and scooters; they are wide and paved. 
There are some hills in the park, which could need some effort if self-propelling a manual chair, most of the hills could be avoided though and there would still be a variety of routes to follow.

For the festival, plastic matting paths had been put down in several areas, particularly where their were stalls etc. 
This didn't seem as easy for getting along as the real paths, but I saw a number of people in wheelchairs (and other people pushing prams and buggys) who seemed to be managing ok.

Matting had also been put down over the grass to allow easier access to the main stages where there was music/performances.
I didn't see any raised platforms, which may have been helpful, but there was lots of space to stand/sit and watch the stages.
I was not aware of any signing or descriptions of the performances. (though as this festival is very multicultural, perhaps several different languages would need reflected in these too)

There were areas which didn't have the matting, so may prove more difficult to access, I particularly noticed this at the Fun Fair area. The majority of the festival could be accessed though.

It was a great atmosphere, with a huge mix of cultures, languages, food, clothing, music and colour. Some people would enjoy this, but it could be overwhelming for some.

"
4633,The Radisson Blu Hotel in Durham is one of the few hotels in Durham which has accessible hotel bedrooms with wetrooms and is also wheeling/pushing distance from the centre of this beautiful city. The staff are always polite and friendly and willing to help. This was my fourth visit to this hotel over the past 2.5 years and each time the quality of room and service has been excellent. It would have got 5 stars but neither of the electric accessible doors were working during my last visit but this was unusual.
4634,"Could not be more helpful, supportive and informative, seem to be a great hit with the pupils from the School."
4635,It's all flat.
4636,"The shop is fully accessible with level access from Fargate, the main street at the front. There is a good-sized lift but this is not really sufficient for such a large and busy shop, as it is not exclusively used by disabled customers.
There is also an entrance at the back from Chapel Walk, but this has several steps and no disabled access."
4637,Within the station there are wheelchair accessible toilets fully equipped to allow easy use. Including a lowered sink and hand dryer.
4638,"Friendly and helpful, it's always busy so I would recommend phoning ahead to reserve a table and mention if you have a wheelchair. "
4639,"There are plenty of accessible toilets - at least one in each area. These sometimes double up as baby change and they are not RADAR locked, so sometimes I had a bit of a wait. They were mostly clean though and big enough to get in and out with my trike."
4640,One disabled parking space immediately outside reception but others far away so not enough spaces.
4641,Very helpful and happy to direct me and answer questions I had about most accessible routes to exit.
4642,The new clubhouse with ramp and double doors means even a cuppa  is accessible now for anyone not capable of walking.
4643,"An expansive, exciting and interesting event with something for everyone. Superbly organised with very friendly and helpful staff. "
4644,Street parking available.
4645,"Always really helpful for anything you require. They have helped carrying snacks to the cinema seats, advise on where facilities are. Can’t fault them"
4646,"The pub has a large tarmac car park with several blue badge spaces. The car park is on a slight hill, but the disabled spaces are on the level. There is room to drop someone off if these spaces are occupied."
4647,Staff were helpful. When I suggested putting a lock on the disabled toilet in the lobby one was fitted witching 48 hours!
4648,"With 6 bays available for disabled, and everything to see and do on the level, it was very nice. No steps for us to worry about as a lift is available to get us up to disabled toilet and into bedrooms, although the lift seemed narrow, and a large chair may struggle to get on.  Plenty of seating areas for a light snack or drinks."
4649,"I arrived at the stadium and followed the crowds around to the West Stand. Getting in was straightforward as there's a dedicated wheelchair entrance so you don't have to do battle with the turnstiles. The West Stand has a large lift, room for a powerchair and manual chair at the same time, that takes you to level one. Once here there are a couple of double doors out on to the wheelchair viewing area. Each wheelchair space is accompanied by a seat for your companion. The views are good and it feels comfortable as you don't have people behind you. It's also relatively sheltered."
4650,Customer service team I have found to be very helpful. 
4651,"We give 3.5 stars as it’s a bit of a ride to find the toilets, and although on the level, it’s a bit of a nuisance. However, the disabled public toilet is large, very clean and well looked after, just simple plain tiled walls and flooring, but it has its grab rail and plenty of room to turn around in there."
4652,"There is a step free entrance to the gardens. The large gates were already opened when I visited. There are brick paved pathways throughout the garden. Some of the bricks are uneven, so take care, and part of the garden is on a short but noticeable slope. The path is mainly step free, there was only one area I noticed with steps and these did not have a handrail. Some of the pathways are rather narrow, which may make them unsuitable for wheelchair users. The plants sometimes have grown onto the path. I found a couple of places very narrow for me an my crutch. It was not a deal breaker but I felt I had to mind my footing in a couple of places. The gardens are compact but were more spacious than I first thought, as they stretch back. The further you go into the gardens the more wooden bench seating you find. There is a lot of seating. "
4653,The disabled toilet on site is exceptional. It is situated to the left as you enter the main exhibition hall and is well signposted. The toilet is fully equipped with an overhead track hoist and changing bench along a wash hand basin that is also on a track allowing it be moved up and down as well as along.
4654,"Signage is good, and there is a ramp."
4655,I thought it was fantastic that this hotel has 9 accessible rooms with ceiling hoists. It's in a decent location with some nice restaurants nearby.
4656,"All but a few exhibits on the level access in a single room. A video  constantly plays to show you what is upstairs. There is one route around the exhibit  - following short pile carpet with rope barriers either side. You can not touch the cars but there are smells of petrol/oil/ 'shed', 'dust' and 'hanger' to take it! Printer booklet describing the car's history. Accessible toilet and tea room."
4657,Paths throughout the complex are to a high standard but a powered chair is advantageous as it is a little hilly.
4658,Everywhere is accessible
4659,"There is step free access throughout. From the top the step free path to the railway is clearly marked with a wheelchair user symbol on the ground. There is the a notable slope with a handrail on the right hand side (descending). Both upper and lower stations have step free access. When the carriage arrives staff operate the doors. Inside the carriage is spacious, there are 4 seats, grab rails and handles. At the lower station there is another more steeper slope down to the beach. Initially exiting the railway there is a hand rail. However where it meets the road there is a sharp slope with no handrails. I walk with a crutch and on 1st seeing it I almost turned straight back to go up again. I ended up walking on the road so I could grab hold of the mess fencing for extra support. When  mentioned it later to the staff at the railway I was told that the Council were responsible for the road.  I feel that a handrail down to the beach would be a helpful addition for people with limited mobility. I also found it quite hard work walking back up due the gradient and lack of handrail. However, I'm glad I walked down from the railway to the beach as it was really lovely and peaceful.
The railway has a fascinating, small visitor centre at Oddicombe Beach, which is step free and has seating."
4660,Parked just outside - but route back to the car not very accessible.  
4661,Beautiful disabled toilet with plenty of room.
4662,"Disabled sign on the door.
Let them know you are there and a ramp appears!
We phone ahead to get the accessible tables."
4663,"I may already have reviewed this venue. My husband and I saw Muse here. Wonderful venue, wonderful staff. The platforms are at the sides of the 'mosh pit' and the view is fantastic. Each platform holds two people in wheelchairs each with one companion. Highly recommended."
4664,Very friendly and informative 
4665,"Good food, very spacious and beautiful views over River Clyde "
4666,"A visit to the newly refurbished historic jail. There are a number of other different events and tours on offer there too. 
Access has been well thought out. 

A free carer ticket is available with proof of disability.  

There is a show that describes the history of the jail, and you get to see the original cells, Governor’s office with historical artificers, hangman’s noose etc. "
4667,"The main floor of the library is located at ground level. The library can be accessed at the Granville Street entrance. At the Granville street entrance there is disabled parking spaces in front of the doors. Doors are automatic here as well. As you enter the building there is an information desk to the right and directly behind the desk there is a disabled toilet. On this floor there is computers, a cafe, books,an information point and a library help desk. There is also seating along the sides of the floor as you pass the cafe. On the ground floor There is also the Mitchell Theatre which has some steps leading up to the entrance. When i asked a staff member how a wheelchair user would gain access to the theatre? She informed me that there are two side entrances to the theatre. Which if notified, can assist if needed."
4668,Drove by car. Gravel car park with unmarked parking spaces - no disabled parking.
4669,All staff were very friendly and helpful. Always happy to help.
4670,Staff were friendly and helpful. There is a low level reception desk with staff behind. Numerous Life guards are present at pool times all time for safety reasons.
4671,"The accessible bedroom had a bath, in spite of my stating my need for a roll-in shower. Such rooms do exist but I can't advise how to ensure you get one."
4672,"I counted two in total - all well sign-posted and although I personally did not avail myself, I am informed they are both a decent size & well appointed."
4673,we parked in a stubble field - not a problem because the weather had be dry and sunny + we have a cross country wheelchair. May be difficult with a standard chair - so suggest using the Sculpture park car park. Good access
4674,Staff were helpful but in short supply especially in the gym itself. 
4675,"Gym is located in middle of city centre, there is on street parking for blue badge holders but it is often full. There is also a multi story car park and bus station with wheelchair accessible buses but it is a quite a walk away. "
4676,"There are loads of disabled parking spaces available on Churchill Way, about a minutes walk from cinema."
4677,"Super helpful, very friendly "
4678,"Beautiful national trust property with clifftop walks. 

The main attraction was their Tramper, a very sturdy off road mobility scooter. You have to book it in advance and be a member of countryside mobility but they'll let you do the countryside mobility paperwork on the day. Very easy.

When I arrived I was given an induction by staff on how to use the Tramper (v straightforward) and the different routes. There were about three different walks you could do with the tramper and I picked the headland walk. We were given a map showing the way, including a couple of detours to avoid kissing gates and things. The way was also clearly marked with scooter symbol way markers.

The route up to the headland was pretty stony, uphill and a bit rough. I don't think my normal little Apex Rapid boot scooter could have coped with it, but other sturdy or off road mobility devices probably could. The Tramper had absolutely no trouble with the terrain.

We had a beautiful treck up to the headland and back. The views were absolutely incredible and it felt amazing to go somewhere so wild and remote. 10/10!!

We were also approached by a National Trust photographer who asked if he could take some candid pictures of us to show off the Tramper. A couple of them are now on the website - my claim to fame!"
4679,"Fairly good, if a little confusing. It's just a bit unclear where the wheelchair accessible path's destination is aiming to lead; and I think this is because sand has blown over some parts of the walk and hasn't been cleared. It's a good place for a breath of fresh air and sunset."
4680,Disabled toilet is at the entrance to the conservatory. Red cord does not reach the floor 
4681,"Accessible, just like it should be! Easy to reach too - close by the main eating area and not miles away down a corridor."
4682,The step-free feature for boarding trains isn't perfect as there is a bit of a height difference. I'd describe it as being similar to going up a small kerb - the trick for me was to keep moving. When getting on look out for the wheelchair spaces - they're marked with signs.
4683,Kerry farm as a unique team of people that are truly accommodating champ fun to be around robin is very good with his advice ali friendly very helpful great with the children helps arange your days out makes your time stress free ! Chris brilliant always ready to help Tina incredible lady who makes your time truly amazing shes the best worker there The Children can warm to her shes lovely  Natalie is a amazing person her hard work shows in the farm she works so hard making sure every person whos stays gets  the true kerry farm experience she is the heart of the farm a wonderful person to meet
4684,The loo is clean but the proportions are tight as is the corridor on which it is situated. However Coffee #1 has done their best given the restrictions of an old building.
4685,Excellent disabled toilet at the cafe. 
4686,"Not an easy place to find as our sat NAV did not register where it was, so had to find own way here, which took some time. It’s not well signposted, and in the middle of our newly built housing estate."
4687,"Step free entrance, room for wheelchairs to manoeuvre  "
4688,A shower/commode chair was provided to suit the Closomat toilet. 
4689,"No understanding of how it feels to be disabled, ....why should we not be happy sitting outside?! 

I go here often , I live locally so this isn't just a one off. I've been there before when the lift has been out of action. A young man kindly offered to "" bump me down the stairs "" . I waited until it was fixed!  I felt extremely vulnerable. "
4690,Absolutely brilliant! 
4691,"We've been to this pub for meals several times in recent months. Food excellent and all staff very friendly. A popular place so worth booking.

Access for disabled people is possible via the back entrance via the gate at the side. Getting through the door in a wheelchair is tight -you'll probably need a push. We always sit in the room at the rear of the pub.

There us no disabled toilet. But if you have some mobility e.g. crutches, the gents toilet is on the flat. (My wife tells me the ladies is too.)
"
4692,Disabled parking in underground carpark
4693,"Great, lower floor of the multi storey car park is designated for people with blue badges.  

Lanes to get out are a bit narrow, be careful if you have a large van!!"
4694,It was easy to find and very big and spacious
4695,As you would expect the clubs staff are superb.
4696,The staff in the cafe were very helpful and friendly. I was with a friend who walks with a stick and the young members of staff twice carried a tray over for us and went and found us cutlery and a jug of iced water.
4697,Disabled Parking at front of building.
4698,All level access into beautician and it is situated right beside the front door of the hospital. Very spacious inside beautician and Jane move beautician bed so there is plenty of room for my chair. Also waiting area is spacious.
4699,Fantastic experience. Activity was good and very enjoyable. Very wheelchair friendly and exceptional staff.
4700,"Visited this place with my family, me being on my recently purchased velobike vespa scooty and the accessibility was great. No hurdles during the whole outing, beautiful views without being disturbed or distracted. It's not easy to find a good place that allows people like me to just forget about having mobility problems, so kudos!"
4701,"This is an annual exhibition of most things to do with Disabilities.
Ranging from cars and mobility scooters to the more basic needs, what's there changes every year and is quite revealing and very interesting in my eyes."
4702,"With there being a hotel here to there is a car park that you can easily park in with easy access to the settlement. Unfortunately, there is no designated disabled parking spaces, although there are no lines separating parking spaces at all so cars didn’t seem to park too close together.

The car park surface was very even excluding a couple of pot holes."
4703,See above
4704,"A bakehouse and wine shop - the stuff of dreams! Great cake, and fairly good access - although room for improvement. Staff are lovely!"
4705,Parking is available but they're often full as the restaurant is located on a busy street in Brunsfield.
4706,"We had been told and had read all sorts of negative comments and experiences about Tirana and Albania. The people could not be more friendly, warm, keen to get to know you, to develop their English and totally extend a great hospitality. "
4707,The warm welcome from the staff really made me feel at home in the visitors centre. They couldn't do enough to help and immediately offered me the WiFi code etc. 
4708,"Very pleased to find a clean, reasonably spacious accessible loo on Cromer Pier, and someone before me had even put a Euan's Guide card on the emergency cord!"
4709,"The members of staff I spoke to were friendly, and asked me about my day. "
4710,Each floor had an easily accessd accessible loo - which was large and clean with no obstructions.
4711,"I managed to get on the plane, so I guess that's access of a kind. "
4712,"Devonshire car park is just across the road and parking is free for blue badge holders.
There is a drop off point outside the bar entrance too.

Bus and tram stops are just a couple of minutes away."
4713,"Very helpful, friendly and attentive! "
4714,"The accessible toilet is essentially OK but has a few issues: (1) the coat hook by the toilet door- see above (2) the red emergency cord had been tied up so that it stopped well over a metre above the floor, it should reach all the way to the floor so that it can be pulled if someone falls over and needs help  (3) the toilet room is so small that it's impossible to turn your wheelchair, there's hardly room to wash a hamster."
4715,The restaurant was very busy but service was friendly and was quickly served.
4716,"Signage to the accessible loo is very poor, but it's spacious and clean. The red cord was too short but I'm confident that this will be resolved."
4717,The toilets were located in a small cabin with stairs and a ramp. Very easy access.
4718,This is a delightful very old coaching inn set in the Dalton Estate in East Yorkshire. Please note that this is only a review of the bar eating area and not the more formal restaurant or the accommodation. 
4719,"Step-free access at most entrances but no automatic doors & the doors are heavy & stiff & very hard to open if you're in a wheelchair. One lift was out of order, and I was breezily informed by a member of staff that ""it's usually not working"". The other lift is tiny, and grubby. When you emerge from that lift in the basement, beware - there's a steep ramp leading from it, I emerged backwards much too fast, not expecting the ramp.

Very little room to manoeuvre throughout the shop, the display tables are huge and the gaps between them are too small. Whole areas of the shop are inaccessible to wheelchair users."
4720,No parking in the immediate area.
4721,Just been to this spa for the second time and it was just as good.  I am a wheelchair user and do not walk at all.  The spa is totally accessible and the staff are amazing.  There is a hoist into the thermal spa and the staff support you to use this.  The treatment rooms are all accessible and the staff will do all they can to assist you.  There is no hoist onto the treatment beds so you do need to be able to transfer.  The only criticism I would have is they need a wider bed and portable hoist onto the treatment beds.  Having said that it will not stop me going again in September. They made one of the treatment rooms accessible to us which included an accessible toilet and shower even though we were only day visitors.  Well done Yspa wish others would take your lead.
4722,"I honestly can’t remember if there was an accessible toilet in The New Harbour Café however, it was quite small, so I think there was only a male and female toilet. Although there is a Changing Places toilet not far away in the town centre of Lerwick."
4723,"Toilets are good and clean. The are big enough for turning room.  No seats for a carer although ample room.  Quite a long sloped floor from main floor to toilet on ground floor - gradient compiles but length makes getting back to main floor for theatre, cafe, bar, shops can be difficult without assistance."
4724,"The most beautiful hotel right on a beach, ramps everywhere, sunloungers reserved for blue badge people by the pool and on the beach, Sea going wheelchair with staff to drive it. Golf buggy to take less able clients around the resort. Plenty of disabled toilets although a little small in my opinion. 12 accessible hotel rooms plus 9 accessible little villas that were one bedroom plus sofa bed and looked really pretty. The hotel room had a wet room with a shower and a shower seat and a wheel under basin. One grab rail at the toilet. The room was spacious and I could get my chair on the balcony. The sea was warm and the hotel was all inclusive with really lovely food. All in all a fabulous holiday with no access worries for a change. "
4725,"Despite a recent review here advising us that this venue is wheelchair friendly, it is not. I phoned the venue concerning an upcoming show today, to be told that the have a stairclimber which negates the old habit of being carried up the stairs. The 'viewing platform' is still the old rear gantry which doesn't have leg-room allowing a disabled customer to face the stage. Nice if you have spasticity symptoms and have to crank your head all night. Also there are no toilets on the level. 

But here's the stinger - powerchairs are not included as they're too heavy for the rudimentary stair-climbing facility. Since i was last there, I'm in need of a powerchair. 

This venue is still not properly wheel-chair accessable."
4726,"The market is in a pedestrian area and as a result there is no parking near to this venue.
The Blackpool tram system nearest stop would be Tower or North Pier this is a good 10mins walk away"
4727,"Ground level access from parking to walking right into the inflatables. No shoes allowed, leave shoes at entrance. Enablers were available on hand if needed."
4728,there's a ramp to get to the entrance and level access inside
4729,"So well thought out.  Beautiful, relaxing stay.  This place is a real find."
4730,"I loved this museum and wish I could've stayed longer. Very informative, accessible for myself and well laid out. My ticket was about 15 euros."
4731,Wowzers - we found the mobiloo!! I'd heard that there was a portable Changing Places in the area again this year - brilliant to see it... we didn't need to use it this time but it's so fantastic having it there... it means that it's accessible to so many visitors to all types of different venues nearby too... brilliant idea...
4732,"Fully accessible toilet, easily found. Enough space to get around. Loo had grab rails, was clean and tidy. Mirror was at sitting level. Might be a little tight for a carer. "
4733,Toilets were large and clean and with free hanging red cords.
4734,"Samuel Jones is a large pub/restaurant with a varied menu and an excellent range of ales on tap. The staff are incredibly friendly, welcoming and aware of the importance of making their pub accessible and enjoyable for all. There is street level access to the pub, as well as a wide ramp if approaching from the river side. Whilst some seating is up  a few steps, there are various seating areas to choose from that enable wheelchair access. The toilet facilities are spacious and clean. A great place to while away an afternoon in the sunshine on the terrace, or enjoy a celebratory meal or a few drinks in the evening."
4735,"Accessible toilets with plenty of grab rails and enough room for carers to come in and plenty of room to manoeuvre my wheelchair in.
The emergency red cord also hung freely to the floor.
Only downside was that the toilet roll was at a bit of a reach.
Not always clean and tidy."
4736,When I purchased something the staff member was very friendly and helpful.
4737,"Lovely room, easily accessible throughout. Restaurant on floor 1 but access easy via lift."
4738,"Out of all the more than one hundred reviews we have offered you, this was the least friendly or helpful place we have yet visited, no one seemed to be bothered, well not until we were going, but we were payed no attention at all, no advice offered to warn us of the difficulty disabled people are going to face as we moved around the hotel and grounds. The effort really hurt my husband, it was very difficult a ride, a bit easier when we both went together for drinks, but even that was not done without lots of grumbling, so as we stated, THIS IS NOT WHEELCHAIR FRIENDLY."
4739,"There are disabled rooms which are very well equipt. The bathroom is large and has grab rails, shower seats and a low bath. The toilets in the lobby of the hotel are easily accessible for people with disabilities."
4740,Always happy to help
4741,"im a wheel chair user and from the moment we parked up we had someone showing us where to go I had access every where , no embarrassing moments of tables  having to be moved for my  wheel chair, only thing was there was a bath which I couldn't get into, but on the whole definitely worth a visit , beautiful place"
4742,From the moment we entered the venue we were on plastic 'decking' so it made it easy to get around - it had slanting edges so wasn't a trip hazard either. The accessible viewing area was well signposted. The platform was spacious and had great sightlines - it had folding chairs so people could arrange themselves as they wished. There was a chap with a cool bag on the platform so you could get drinks almost without leaving your seat. There was also a wheelchair charging point on the platform. You could tell a lot of thought had gone into disabled access at the festival! It's worth noting that we visited on a dry summer's day so I'm sure that we would have found it a little more tricky in torrential rain.
4743,All staff are approachable and friendly. There is an information desk located on the first floor of the shopping centre beside John Lewis.
4744,"The entrance to the toilets is for some reason through two dividers which might be difficult to access in a larger wheelchair. The door may also be a little difficult without help. The disabled toilet itself is outstanding - spacious, clean, the toilet can be accessed from either side."
4745,There were standard loos but no disabled loos.
4746,"Does not have it’s own parking, we parked on the main road."
4747,Staff for individual shops visited were nice. Security members for the corn exchange were friendly and helped with directions to lift.
4748,"The entrance is big, especially the porch area. There were trolleys blockin g the path in though. The entrance was very busy."
4749,"I needed to ask where the accessible toilet was and a staff member brought the key and showed me. You have to go back out to the porch where the loo was but it didn't open straight into the path of people going in or out of the pub. The toilet area was clean with everything within reach. The hand dryer was actually a good one and powerful one. There was a handrail but it would have needed moving down. I couldn't have done it on my own or reached it due to the sanitary box next to the loo.
There wasn't a Changing Places toilet and it would have been a squash to have 2 people in there plus a wheelchair."
4750,"This garden centre has so much to see. Beautiful plants and well looked after, a huge array of gift options and a very nice restaurant. Disabled parking for cars right outside the entrance and also some just around the corner."
4751,"We had one of 5 accessible rooms in this recently completed hotel. A great deal of thought has gone into these rooms which connect with a room for carers. The comfortably furnished room is spacious with lots of turning space for my power chair. Desk/dressing table very usable and all mirrors well placed. Bathroom very well designed with lots of well placed handrails, seated shower and wetroom flooring. Reception and the adjoining restaurant were very spacious and the staff very helpful and friendly. An extremely enjoyable stay."
4752,"No negative issues, signage perhaps could be expanded."
4753,"Approximately 6 blue badge spaces in the car park (don't forget Durham County Council charge blue badge users for parking).   There are some picnic benches on the grass near the car park, 2 with a wheelchair space.   Also near the car park is a café,  shop and an accessible toilet. 

The park comprises a large lake and a few smaller ponds, some follies and wooded areas.  The main path around the park is tarmac, relatively flat and runs in a circle around the park."
4754,"Parking on the spot and regular bus services to and from the city centre,  also the Lothian no. 38 to and from Balgreen, the south side and the Royal Infirmary in one direction and Crewe Toll and Granton in the other (but no longer at weekends, for some reason)."
4755,I did not use the fascilities.
4756,There were plenty of ramps for wheelchair users . There were also a lot of signs. 
4757,It's a pretty inaccessible place to go to if you have a wheelchair or a mobility scooter.
4758,Great night at the basketball its a shame the rocks never won
4759,Play park with wheelchair accessible areas to provide inclusion for everyone. Also has changing place toilet for those who need the use of a hoist. Great fun and would definitely go back when I want to just act like a big kid for an hour or so. 
4760,"A flat drive - no problem.

I didn’t use public transport so don’t know."
4761,"the newly refurbished building has good access on the ground floor, with enough well designed disabled toilets. The walkways are clutter free and easy to navigate. outside there is accessible parking spaces and parking is free. Staff are friendly , welcoming and happy to help."
4762,Staff very helpful and willing to assist with shopping. Even collected items from the customer pickup point and brought them to me.
4763,"King's Cross underground station  is a major transport hub with 5 underground lines. 

This was my first visit after shielding and with the introduction of the new one way system as part of covid-19 measures. 

Previously I have found the tube station verya ccessible, albeit busy. I'm concerned about the new one way layout. "
4764,"We had a brilliant day out at Landmark Forest Adventure Park, and while not everything is fully accessible, all of the activities are visible and in the open which makes it a great place to go with all the family. The accessible treetop trail is fantastic as well."
4765,Although the building is across 3 floors there is a lift to access all floors. There is dedicated changing and shower room for disabled visitors and a seperate disabled toilet on the first floor next to the gym. All of the facilities and toilets are well signed. Doors are wide and easily opened. Floors are hard and corridors are kept free of clutter. There is step free access throughout the club even down to the pontoons on the river.  Basically there is no impedement to access. It's so refereshing to go to a club that is fully accessible. 
4766,"Lunch at Martin Wishart Loch Lomond was a treat even without the outstanding food.Easy access ,attentive but unobtrusive staff made this a joy and well worth the experience.Eight courses of stunning food leaves me wanting to return soon."
4767,"The settings were lovely and peaceful, the lodge it's self had everything that was needed for people with disabilities, we had a varied range of needs due to the number of people going. At no point was this an issue and everything was put in place for us. The welcome was wonderful we were shown round and were given plenty of information about the surrounding areas. I would highly recommend this place for anyone that has a disability or who care for someone with a disability "
4768,"There was a disabled accessible toilet on the 1st floor but there was a queue, so unable to comment as I used the ladies toilets. A least one of the cubicles in the ladies has a single grab rail to aid transfer. 
Update from further visit in March 2018 when I did use the accessible toilet. It's located on the first floor and is a spacious cubicle with grab rails but no emergency cord. 

UPDATED 2019:  Accesssble toilet has been refurbished and there is a brand spanking new accessible toilet, with lots of grab rails and an emergency cord which reached to the floor. Brilliant. Thank you Mill at Sonning it looks amazing."
4769,"Our tour of Edinburgh concluded after an overnight stay at Indigo hotel, (photo 1) Princess street, and late morning we went down the ramp (photo 2) and into the bar lounge (photo 3) in which we enjoyed a final drink and light refreshments, and being from a Scottish family, I think it right to let you know about Scotland’s favourite drink, a Scotch whisky.
My father was born and bred in Wick, Caithness, Scotland, and just a few yards from 
his home, was the whisky distillery of Pultenay, where they produced a single malt whisky, Old Pultenay. I much prefer this whiskey, matured in American oak Bourbon barrels, and Spanish oak Sherry casks. Its taste has a hint of chocolate, citrus and peanuts, and when sipping, you can just make out toffee and lemon hints.
My Grandmother however was a Dewar, from the whisky producing family of 
Dewars, who’s distillery lies in the Scottish highlands, south of Pitlochry, and just 75 miles north of Edinburgh. The distillery is at Aberfeldy, just some 3 miles away from where it’s first producer lived, John Dewar.  Now they produce a blended whisky, that is a mix of various types of whisky, and sometimes grain spirits which have been distilled at other distilleries. They do have a single malt as well though.
So we see what blended whiskies are, but just what is a single malt whisky ?

It is still a blended whisky, from different barrels or casks. Each cask has its own taste, left in the barrel when first used, and it’s these tastes that helps to make one whisky taste different from another. So each distillery blends each barrel together to get the flavour they want, the barrel may have held a Sherry, bourbon, or other spirits. 
But I still want to know what a single malt whisky is ?
Simply put, it must have been made by ONE DISTILLERY, such as Pultenay. 
Now this has surprised me, because I always thought it was a special blend of whisky of some type of cereal, magically produced and blended together. But no, it’s just made by ONE DISTILLERY.
So what is a single malt whisky then ?
It’s the grain they use to make the whisky. In a single malt whisky it is always BARLEY, to which water is added, which makes the Barley grain germinate. Then it’s spread out on a malting floor, and after a few days, say 6 or 7, after having been tossed 
about in the air, it’s now known as GREEN MALT. It’s then put into a kiln, with a heat below 70c, and now, some distilleries will add peat to the fire to give it flavour from the smoke.
This drying allows them to grind the malt, or mix, into a grist (flour) and then water is added again, first at 67c, then hotter water is added, and finally the last hot water near to boiling point is added. To the distillery, the quality of the Scottish water used 
is so important, so careful eyes are kept on the streams and rivers.  All this mix is now known as MASH, which is then stirred to convert the starches produced into sugar. So after the Mash is finished, the sugary liquid is called WORT. The left over grain will then be made into cattle feed.
This WORT is now cooled and pumped into containers, and yeast is added to allow fermentation to begin, which will produce alcohol, and other compounds are added. 

Each distillery has its own carefully selected stills, and they will use these stills for many years. The still is now heated just below boiling point, and the alcohol vaporises and is condensed into a liquid.
This colourless spirit, now 63% alcohol, is filled into the oak casks (or barrels) which held Sherry, bourbon or even scotch whisky, and it’s now, from these stained insides of the barrels that whisky gets it brown colours. By law the mix must be left in the barrel for at least 3 years, but most single malts are left for 8; 10, 12 and longer years, the longer the more expensive of course.
Finally, it’s put into bottles, after which it no longer matures.
Now we know why whisky costs us so much, so drink it carefully, appreciate each sip, and don’t gulp it down.

Satisfied with our holiday in Scotland, we departed Indigo hotel (photo 4) and crossed Princess street ( photo 5) saying farewell to Edinburgh’s famous castle (photo 6) walked across, or in my case, pushed across, to take the lift (photo 7) down and over the glass roof top of Waverley station (photo 8) exiting on the concourse (photo 9) and walked to the mobility assistant stand (photo 10) and then taken onto our Avanti train (photo 11) and settled into our seats (photo 12 for the long journey home.
"

4773,Great Access throughout the Stadium
4774,Polite and friendly.
4775,"Poole has plenty of disabled parkiglng around Poole, and a Mobility facility too."
4776,Really nice and helpful.
4777,"To my knowledge staff support is not an option, however Fiona the owner is very helpful, supporting in any way she can."
4778,We could park directly next to it - not on the official car parks.
4779,"exceptional accommodation for people with disabilities that can be enjoyed with their family and friends.Huge space,light and airy all amenities that would help make a holiday easy and enjoyable.Brand new and furnished to a high specification.Hoisting in place with massive wet room,two profiling beds etc etc.This would easily accommodate more than one disabled person at a time.Nice site adjacent to a steam railway and childrens train running along side."
4780,Brilliantly appointed and so easy to get to and in. Really felt like a home from home and the facilities are extremely good. Cant fault this place at all. Would love to return in the future
4781,This pub is situated in an older building but it is accessible to wheelchairs. Very nice surroundings and setting with fairly standard pub food. 
4782,There was an accessible loo opposite reception - clean & spacious... Only one issue - unfortunately the emergency cord was cut off at so nowhere near the floor & rendering it pretty useless!
4783,"Good they had an accessible loo but you needed two hands to close it, I couldn't close it."
4784,"There were accessible toilets at several places throughout the gardens. 
These seemed well looked after."
4785,It’s a place you need a car for there is spaces
4786,"The door in is on a slope upwards which is hard to enter, but once you are inside it's a good experience. Staff are professional and helpful to everyone those with disabilities especially. They wait and listen to whatever you are using as an aid. The lay out is very accessible even for my chunky chair, the toilet is big enough for me to turn all the way around which is definitely a rarity. All in all I chose this café over most other places here in Perth."
4787,"car park up the back but the Café has no car parking of its own, its quite steep getting to and from the car park to the Cafe"
4788,Lots of space in the room and outside. Very big wetroom.
4789,Taken here for lunch in a manual wheelchair. Loads of suitable parking but in deep gravel so had to be pulled backwards to the path. Staff very helpful. 
4790,"Fantastic disabled toilet facilities, including a toilet at the main entrance with hoist, changing table and a toilet which includes facilities for washing and drying the user. Other disabled toilets are available throughout the attraction."
4791,The access to the cinema lifts can be quite difficult to find if people have not parked in the level 3 car park as only certain lifts allow direct access to go in the cinema. However there are signs within the shopping centre to direct people to lifts which allow them to go onto level 3. From this point a separate lift on level 3 can be used to connect to the cinema. The desks to purchase tickets are easy to find and were at a suitable height to allow staff members to communicate effectively with the customers
4792,There is a small kerb to enter the property which I managed in my powerchair with a little help from my carer.
4793,"I can only comment on Room #1. The bathroom is accessible on the flat. It is large and comfortable, but there were no rails or handles. There was a bidet next to the loo which might cause problems if you needed to transfer, but for someone walking with sticks it was accessible."
4794,"Adorable, helpful, friendly, alert. Perfect."
4795,"Crystal Suites that own the apartment pre-booked me a taxi from Krakow airport. The taxi driver was waiting for me at the arrival hall and I waited just outside when he went to get the taxi. It was a people carrier but there were grab rails to help me get in and out. Taxi drivers, both from and to the airport couldn't have been more helpful regarding parking and offering assistance. The journey to/ from airport by taxi took about 20 minutes.

The road parallel to the accommodation is a main road which has trams running along. I didn't use the tram while I was there so unable to comment, apart from I noticed that the new trams had wheelchair signs by one of the doors.

For me it was about a 20 - 30 minute walk to the Old Town, but I took a detour to view the castle. I came home by taxi, which I picked up from Krakow Station, which cost 30 Polish zloty, about £6. Please note that when I used street taxis they charged more than pre-booked and the drivers were always unhelpful, they just sat there and never offered help even when it was obvious I was struggling to get in/ get out. I would say please don't let this put you off going but just be aware of what to expect."
4796,"Very helpful and welcoming. The barrista asked me to sit down and he would bring my order to the table. Checked if I needed sugar etc. and fetched it when I confirmed I did.

The Duty Manager was friendly and promised to make sure that problems would be sorted as soon as possible.

ALL PROBLEMS SORTED AND IN A VERY QUICK AND PROMPT MANNER. WELL DONE NERO'S.
"
4797,Everyone I met was pleasant enough.
4798,"Great wheelchair accessible central hotel located above Dundee’s Train Station.

I was kindly invited to an event at this fantastic central hotel in Dundee representing Euan’s Guide as one of their Dundee Ambassadors. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to stay over, but I was able to previously view the hotels accessible room, read on to find out my thoughts.
"
4799,"Easy to find, easy to use. Radar key can be used or if you don't have one if you ask they give you one. "
4800,"During our visit the staff were friendly and very helpful. On arrival a member of staff showed us to our rooms, explained how the lifts worked, and the procedures in the event of a fire.

At mealtimes the staff taking our order and serving the food were friendly and welcoming. "
4801,Easy to read clear signs for the doors on access to the building and on the toilet doors.
4802,Great food at affordable prices with friendly and helpful staff.
4803,"Typical city centre parking, sometimes easy, sometimes difficult"
4804,"I'm not sure where the nearest parking is as City Square is pedestrianised, but the main bus stops are a short walk away. "
4805,"Other than the loos in our room, I did not use the others in the hotel.
Whilst the one in the room had a drop down rail, I found that it was very close to the wall and sink, which made access difficult.  I could not reach the loo roll holder and just used the spare roll because of this."
4806,Always friendly and polite.
4807,Accessible loo at the lagoon and the visitor centre. Downside to the toilet at the lagoon is that there is only one accessible loo and that seems to double up as baby changing. As it's the closest loo to the children's play area at busy times you can have to queue for a long time behind the babies. With a facility this new why didn't they have separate baby change?
4808,"We used the Britford park and ride. It has disabled parking spaces and the single decker buses are wheelchair friendly, and the drivers are very helpful. The only negative is that if you’re pushing a wheelchair the path from the bus back to the disabled parking is very steep.
Salisbury city centre is all on the level and , apart from a few wonky pavements, there’s no problem pushing the wheelchair round."
4809,Where there are steps there's a ramp also mainly flat all round the complex. Several parking spaces around the complex and a main car park as well. Not sure of the cost for parking as I live in the village.
4810,La Tasca has large double doors at the main entrance to the building in which you can open with the push of a button making it accessible to everyone. A lift is provided for customers unable to use the spiral staircase up to the first floor. Once upstairs there is another large seating area. There is also a rooftop terrace available however there are two small steps down to reach this and no ramp is provided. The wooden floor makes it easy to maneuver around the many tables on the ground and first floor.
4811,"Getting in to the building was initially confusing as you have the Johnnie Walker shop which is bright and bold; facing the Main Street as it does. The Tour entrance is tucked back from Princes Street and to the side of the building. Watch out for the coloured ropes by the door as a clue. When we got closer we were greeted by someone at the door and from then on it was easy sailing. All through the building thought has been given to being able to move around easily. There is plenty of space, good lighting and lifts. 

We were visiting to take a tour and this was super accessible for me and my pal who uses a wheelchair. I couldn't work the iPads at the start of the tour where you do a quiz to determine your preferred flavours but this wasn't a big deal as the member of staff was quick to offer assistance and read out the questions for me and explain what was happening on the screens. Collecting a coloured wrist band I was off!

We were then introduced to our tour guide and headed off up to the ""Experience"" and our first stop was a quick overview and explanation of some of the housekeeping things. A dip into the theatre style room with a long low stage started us on our journey. An actress walked up and down the stage telling stories and setting the scene. As she changed story the stage morphed into different things such as the grocer's store. Items moved across the stage in a spookily way as no-one pushed or touched them; such as the spinning globe and the whisky crate. 

We moved on to visit the Grocer's Store where we got to try our first drink and sample the flavours. It was rather hi-tech and fascinating as the experience came alive as our host weaved the story. It was good to see that non-alcoholic drinks were also on offer and driver's could get a pack to take away too. I shall not spoil anyone's visit by saying more about the Store.

We then explored the story of whisky making and the four distilleries that contribute to Johnnie Walker. It felt like a cross between Dr Who's Tardis and a Chemistry Lab. Again, very immersive and not something to spoil byt letting the secrets out in a review.

Next was my favourite as when they said immersive they meant it. It was a flavours room which offered an amazing light show, audio backdrop and again some storytelling. If you want your senses stimulated then this was the place to be!

Onward we progressed to the Quiz and giving the right answers the doors opened and we were welcomed into a bar. Here we got to try whisky cocktails and the most unimaginable flavours which blew a complete hole in the mythology of whisky only being drunk neat, being always a malt, and being consumed by old people sitting in leather chairs and smoking jackets ... Not here ! Whisky is best drunk how you like it ...

We then went on to explore the amazing shop ... lots to do, to see, to explore and buy. If you are a whisky fan then this was akin to paradise. Coming away with your own engraved bottle of Johnnie Walker Princes Street edition was the icing on the cake!"
4812,Modern Centre for Contemporary Arts. Spacious and easy for wheelchairs. Direct access from car park to lift.
4813,"There is a slight step up to this café however, there is a small ramp to the left-hand side of the step that stays there permanently (circled in image below). I’m sure the width of the ramp is that of a standard wheelchair. The door isn’t automatic and might be difficult for wheelchair users to open, especially with the step behind you as the step is a little further away from the doorway.

If you are visiting with more than 3 people and you are a wheelchair user then you might struggle to find a table to sit at because they are only tables with 2 seats. There are a couple of high tables at the windows but, they would be very hard to get to if it is busy or if any of the tables are full because there isn’t much space between tables.

The counter is at a great height for wheelchair users to be able to talk to staff members but, the cake and sweet treat area is hard to get to because there are tables in front of them."
4814,"Single story building, ramp at front door, automatic sliding doors, low desk at reception"
4815,"Although the restaurant is wheelchair accessible being flat, I would not recommend bringing a wheelchair in here as there isn't much space for manoeuvring, We visited with my mum who walks with a pole - and it was OK for her. There is no disabled parking near by, you would have to be dropped off and then someone go and park the car further away. 
The toilets were OK - one toilet is bigger than the rest - but there were no bars to help people get up off the toilet and no disabled toilet. 
The food was amazing though - definitely somewhere to go try. If you could manage to walk with poles "
4816,I had questions about the sensory garden and the staff were lovely and got there lovely Gardener to come to have a chat with me and answer all my questions. They were also very patient and helpful 
4817,"Step-free throughout, and a wheelchair space easily bookable."
4818,Parking is hit and miss but if your lucky you can temporarily park at the front ...ideal for offloading the wheelchair
4819,They were first class
4820,"Newborough Forest is absolutely beautiful but it is hit and miss with access. Sometimes possible and sometimes not.

Parking is no problem at all with plenty dedicated blue badge spaces. Very open space and flat.

Right by the car park there is short board walk taking you straight to wonderful views of the Llanddwyn beach and a picnic bench on the board walk. You can’t get on the beach as a wheelchair user which is such a shame but it is certainly nice to see the scenery. If it has been windy then it can be difficult or not possible to cross the boardwalk due to sand blowing over and depositing a thick layer of sand on the board walk (see picture). On a day where sand is minimal, it’s perfectly possible as we have done so on other occasions but couldn’t on this visit. See photos.  

The Forrest has an easy nature trail (yellow route). We have done this before in a manual wheelchair but it’s challenging. When we have done it in the Power Chair, it was much easier and manageable so I would say if you want an easy ride, use a Power Chair. It is mainly level and flat but it’s a Forrest so the odd lump and bump. And branches on the floor etc. There are benches around the forest.

Again it can present as an issue if sand has blown over into the route (see photo).

If you are in the area, it’s worth a drive to see if the paths are clear. When they are, it’s a really lovely walk. The drive into the forest is beautiful.

There is an accessible toilet and parking is free with a blue badge (scan the barcode on the back of your blue badge on the way out and the barrier will lift)."
4821,Radar key lock - Very clean and spacious with decent hand dryer. Grab rails by the toilet
4822,"Access is fine. Come into the main entrance of Soar, pass through the building till you come to the centre with all the restaurants and turn to your right.  You will see the venue."
4823,The staff were alright. They weren't helpful or unhelpful.
4824,"Rang prior to visit to ask about access. Very helpful conversation - we were advised which tour to take to make sure the tides were right to make access easier. 2 lovely crew made sure wheelchair user got up the access ramp & board safely, parked us in a good viewing spot & brought 2 cups of coffee.
Excellent !!!"
4825,Disabled parking isn't  that great at the  community centre.
4826,"The loos work ok for our daughter even though they are not special disabled loos in the church itself ~ only in the parish centre and the youth venue, the Storehouse."
4827,The lower level is part of the main Queen St Station its self and is only 2 platforms 8 and 9. These can be accessed by the stairs at either end of the platforms. One set is on the North Hanover St side of the Station. The other set are on the other side of the station on the Queen St side.
4828,"When I went to the loo, one of the staff was immediately ahead of me to open all doors and ensure I was able to get into the disabled toilet with no problem.  The toilet was spacious with a good turning circle, plenty of bars and rails to hold on to and a raised seat.  As soon as I unlocked the door, another member of staff was there to open the doors and ensure I got back to my table with no trouble.  This included asking someone to pull their chair in a bit etc.  So considerate and aware."
4829,The car park is large and has a rough surface but fine for a wheelchair or scooter. There are disabled spaces as you enter the car park. It’s reasonably well signed.
4830,"This is a part of and directly adjacent to the old Surgeons Hall and Museum on the upper South Bridge at Hunter Square, Edinburgh. It is on the southbound side opposite the Festival Theatre and the University of Edinburgh. It’s very popular not just because of the area and interests that surround it but the choice of and quality of its food. Everything is prepared and cooked in house, although they are open till 17.00, tray bakes, scones and foods go very, very quickly. The museum is medical and anatomical so not for those under 16 or of a nervous disposition.

Everything is on one level as is access to the Museum and garden. It’s vibrant place during the Festival and is often a fringe venue. As said home produced food on a light lunch basis, choice of 2 soups, salads, baked pots, grains, meats........... just what the Doctor ordered !."
4831,Parking is at Morrison's. There are accessible parking bays within a short walk. 
4832,"A good wheelchair accessible park with wide paths which have signposts for suitable wheelchair friendly routes. There is a Changing Places toilet in the centre of the park next to the cafe/restaurant. The swing park has an ability swing that accommodates a wheelchair, leave a refundable deposit with the cafe in exchange for the keys and harness to secure your wheelchair. There is plenty of parking around the perimeter and at various car parks.
Seed can be bought at the cafe and lakeside snack bar to feed the birds but lots of people like to feed the relatively tame squirrels so bring nuts too! I understand model boats enthusiasts use the lake of a weekend as well as fishermen. There are often musicians busking in the park. Photographers are a plenty when a mandarin duck or a kingfisher is spotted. Don’t visit without checking out the beautiful palm house, a lovely renovated visitor Ian glasshouse that is stuffed with exotic plants and often has pop up cafes and events.
This is a lovely park used by joggers, students, families, photograpers and is worth a visit."
4833,Friendly and helpful.
4834,"This was one of the times when we were hungry and thought lets go here.

It was nice, but the service was a bit pushy though, I had the worse beer I've ever tasted and the sourdough bread was really hard (how terrible!)"
4835,The owners were lovely and very helpful.
4836,Parking on level one of car park
4837,"The entrance is step-free and it's easy to get around this small café, but hold your bladder, as there's no accessible toilet."
4838,There was a toilet will contrasting grab rails. Toilet was left sided transfer. There was also a shower with seating and grab rails but no changing table. These were located on 1st floor so you have to use lift to access them by wheelchair.  If needed there is a changing places toilet located in the Intu centre which the gym is connected too.  There is an emergency help point on the wall between the accessible toilet and shower. There is also a lower water fountain. 
4839,"Door isn't automatic, counter is high."
4840,"Several difficulties for wheelchair users at this branch of Carluccio's, it's always frustrating and difficult trying to get into the restaurant and there are difficulties once you're inside. "
4841,"The Reading Buses number 21 claret runs from Lower Earley, through Reading University campus and into Reading town centre including the train station.  The buses are almost always wheelchair accessible with a ramp and good space for Wheelchairs and my fold up mobility scooter to get on board.  The bus drivers have always been helpful and encouraged space to be made for me and my scooter onboard."
4842,"Toilet was adapted to the best of their ability. Low sink, grab bars & emergency cord (however this was not close to the ground). No room for a larger wheelchair to get in & manoeuvre or transfer if a full-time user. Much smaller active chair users might be okay depending on turning circle & ability - just over 1 meter squared space from what I can remember. Very clean & tidy."
4843,Wheelchair accessible. 
4844,Extra wide entry doors into the cottage and patio doors onto the secluded garden area with a low level step. The living quarters is open plan/kitchen /dining area. There is a walk in shower with a powerful Mira shower with easy controls too.
4845,"The staff at Yates spoke directly to each of our group members without looking at the carers for assistance. Each individual was understood and asked the appropriate questions you would expect e.g. ice in a drink, which demonstrated fair treatment to all. 
However, the staff did not check back on the enjoyment or quality of our food during or after the meal even though I overheard some other tables being asked this. 
"
4846,Accessible theatre with helpful staff. Easy to access the wheelchair accessible seating and good loos!
4847,"Little bit of a lip to bump over at the front door, but all level inside. It's a small cafe, so it's fair enough to expect to squeeze wheelchairs and small scooters around the tables, but the staff were quick to move things out of the way as needed and other customers were happy to stand up and pull their chairs in for a moment."
4848,"A friendly welcome, level access into the shop, and a fine lift to all floors. Plenty of space between the display stands too. Full marks."
4849,"Local buses stop nearby, there is a car park, and the centre is a short distance from the railway station."
4850,"Parking near the City Art Centre is limited. There is some on street parking and Blue Badge holders may find space on yellow lines. The Art Centre is immediately outside the Market Street entrance of Waverley Station, so is good for trains. Buses don't stop nearby and you would probably have to walk from Princes Streetwhich is about 500 m."
4851,Staff very sensitive to needs of mobility impaired user - offering to carry drink to table etc. Very quick to acknowledge eye contact with a view to getting the key to the loo!
4852,"Reception , shop and cafe  have ramped access, wide enough for a mobility scooter or wheelchair. An all ability trail has recently been constructed in the woodland area by the Loch. "
4853,The accessible toilet is to the left of the reception desk. No access key or pin required. Handrails are on both side and space under the sink to roll under. Signage is clear for the toilets
4854,There is a good accessible toilet off the lounge / bar area. With enough space for me and a PA.
4855,"Me, my 2 brothers and my dad all stayed in this Premier Inn on the 7th of January before we went to Edinburgh airport and we also stayed in the Premier Inn on the 15th of January and it was a very present stay. Nice staff, good wheelchair accessible rooms and an excellent breakfast. Would highly recommend especially if using for going to Edinburgh airport. "
4856,"As mentioned above I really appriciate the steward who let me in via the exit.  I know it's busy and crowded but it would be helpful if stewards were more proactive when they see a disabled person queuing up, as given it was so busy I felt awkward to ask if there was arrangements for disabled people knowing that others would be queuing up for a while. "
4857,"I drove and, sorry, have no idea about public transport. Parking is tricky as only one dis bay exists on the same level as reception."
4858,Good number of spaces are provided but its rare to find one free. No enforcement so it is abused.
4859,"To get to the accessible toilet you need to go past all the tables, which as I’ve said it may be a little difficult to get to in a wheelchair if all the tables are busy. The accessible toilet is spacious at Costa Coffee and I imagine there would be plenty of space for a wheelchair user and someone to assist them. I would say the only thing is that the toilet is nearer the left-hand side of the toilet and there isn’t enough room between the wall and the toilet for someone to transfer at that side, therefore you are only able to transfer at the right-hand side. 

In this toilet they had a sign beside the red cord to tell customers to be careful when pulling it because staff will enter immediately. I’ve never seen this for a red cord before, but I think its really good make sure customers don’t pull it if they don’t know what it’s for. Although the writing is a bit small for customers to read.

There is no Changing Places toilet near this Costa Coffee."
4860,"Parking spaces on nearby roads, Tesco car park behind"
4861,"The staff are brilliant everywhere, especially the various drivers of tiny electric cars, tractors, and other gardening-related vehicles, all of which are whizzing about on the pathways with perfect courtesy and a big smile."
4862,There is a large accessible toilet within the station which I believe you have to ask a key for at the desk. It is only on platform one however!
4863,"There were signs in advance to prepare you for leaving the motorway, which helped me prepare. Their is wheelchair access in to the shop, but you need to go around the front of the building and in the side entrance. A staff member will open the door for you. They are looking in to getting a door bell installed. Once inside, the store is spacious and easy enough to walk around. The counter for ordering is quite high, so was a little awkward giving my order, but the staff were extremely helpful so this wasn't much of an issue."
4864,They did try to push the fizzy wine brunch and did tend to talk to the others rather than directly to me.
4865,The staff are very friendly and welcoming. 
4866,"A great spot for getting to, as I do, by public transport. The tram stopped a couple of hundred metres away. A great roll-on roll-off service if you're a wheelchair user.

There are loads of bus stops nearby and all the buses are low floor wheelchair accessible including the AirLink bus to the airport, the many tourist buses, and the local services.

Taxis are able to drop off at the Mound if that's your chosen transport."
4867,Lifts in the building are too small for people with some power chairs
4868,"So i am a season ticket holder at Murrayfiled for Scotland for the 6 nations and autum season too.
The best way to work through the review is to start from the beginning

gaining tickets...
Murrayfield has a designated number and access team who will help you get tickets for games. The majority of tickets are season passes for a disabled fan and a carer alongside. Some people who have a disabled child and adult in a family can be accomadated extremely well and positioned together.
You can also gain a free parking pass which means you dont need to pay to park on the pitch. 
some issues this year with parking due to commerical enterprises taking precident. 
The staff will guide you to your seat, they also for me, stopped the crowd to allow me through! The tour is disabled friendly and i highly recommend a game there. the crowd can be overwhelming but being down front pitchside eases this concern. 
A great family day out and staff really will go out their way to help you!"
4869,"I'm only allowed to award five stars maximum but I'd have liked to have given two sets of five stars for our visit and the folk we met. The ladies on the desk at the visitor centre were fabulous - not phased by my usual question of how accessible the experience is for wheelchair users. They talked through the visitor journey, where the loos were, what we could see, and how the tickets worked. Finishing by giving us a handy map to plot our way!

When we arrived at the house two cheery stewards met us. Explained how the tour route was accessible all the way through, the options for the audio guides and when I said I didn't 'get on' with audio guides offered a beautifully printed and easy to follow transcript for me to use. They were friendly, amusing and made such a big difference to our visit. Well done to team Abbotsford; particularly as all of these folk were volunteers!"
4870,"Always very helpful and communicate well, the bar staff are the same."
4871,"This review refers to the Prêt at 93-95 Victoria Street, opposite the Albert pub.

There is a big step at the entrance and a doorbell for assistance. The doorbell was not working. I waited outside for several minutes. Horrible. "
4872,"Garrison House is definitely worth a visit. Lovely building with museum , library and excellent cafe. Food is very reasonably priced  -  panini for £4 and £5 .  Indoor and outdoor seating areas with craft shop at the back."
4873,"The staff directed me to a loo with a wide door. They had to move several tables to be able to get my chair to the door. Inside, I found no grab rails at all, not enough space to turn around, the toilet was at standard height i.e. lower than my chair, making transfer difficult, and the basin was at standing height with a cupboard underneath so I couldn't reach the taps. It may have been a large stall but it definitely wasn't accessible."
4874,"An easily accessible ice-cream parlour specialising in ice-cream, waffles & crepes. A must visit place for any ice-cream lover!"
4875,Hoist system in accessible bedroom. electric flushing toilet
4876,Magma is full of independent and creative magazines as well as books and gifts. The shop is wonderfully spacious with smooth floors.
4877,Some narrow pathways and steep inclines
4878,"We have never had any issues with accessibility in ikea - parking spot on, all floors even, spacious, disabled toilets and large variety of seating and tables in restaurant."
4879,"Radar key disabled toilet, easy to find. Room for a carer plus wheelchair. Reasonably clean and tidy although it hadn't been filled up with toilet paper and I had to ask for some! "
4880,Staff are helpful and knowledgeable. 
4881,N/A came in on train
4882,never enough but Ben helpful on checkout
4883,very good
4884,"Waverley station is a nightmare to exit, lifts are hogged by perfect abled body people who don't care about accessibility to other"
4885,"Good access over all - 4 * rating due to one step from street, but the restaurant have thoughtfully created an excellent solution for wheelchair users."
4886,"Entrance is through a lightweight, but non-automatic door, where there is a slight nuisance of a divider which forces you to turn either left or right as you walk into the pub. I assume this is to keep drafts away from customers, which is great, but it may make for a slightly tight turn if you are using a wheelchair or powerchair. 

Once inside, you are greeted by a member of staff who will seat you. Chair types are mixed, with lots of easy to move armchairs dotted around tables - leaving a good amount of space for wheelchair users to sit. It's all table service which is great! 

The pub isn't too dark or loud which is good, and there is a nice cosy fireplace for the winter months. 

If you do want to go out to the beer garden, a single door right beside the accessible toilet pushes open easily (it's a fire exit style door) and you come straight to a ramp and a small set of steps where there is a cheery row of colourful beer beach huts and tables. The ramp takes you right up to the beer garden where you can either choose to sit at the tables on the astro-turf, or head inside one of the huts. They are all open at the front, no doors to negotiate, but the tables in the centre of each are very sturdy and would be difficult to move. This means if you are a wheelchair user, you would need to position your chair on the outer side of the hut with your back to the beer garden - which may be a bit chilly in winter months, but right in the middle of the action in the summer months! Plus you don't have far to travel to the accessible toilet."
4887,I enjoyed it. The trampolines were good. Staff were great. Great day.
4888,"All on one level, lifts to the upper tier"
4889,Special because we were in Italy but I am told by those who know that it is a fairly run of the mill Italian restaurant.   However we enjoyed it!
4890,Excellent but no Changing places
4891,The keypad entry has small keys and there is no raised line on the 5 for those with visual impairments. You can get a fob which makes things easier but they cost £6. The door is electronic but it opens really quick so it hits the front of my chair. The water fountains are not at an accessible height and the sign for toilets points to the stairs not the lift. There is a lift to all floors but the doors are manual and you have to keep holding the button down to get it to work. There are no machines that can be used directly from a wheelchair other than free weights and majority of the machines are awkward transfers as well There is no braille signs. They do require those with access needs to have a Personal Evacuation Plan. There are help points with large print signs. The help point has braille label. 
4892,"Unexpectedly, for an office access was particularly good in this instance."
4893,Dropped off by taxi immediately outside.
4894,There are blue badge bays on the side of the multi-storey nearest the restaurant (level 1 by the theatre) but it's still some way to the restaurant/theatre (inside the Peacock Centre) and you have to pay (the pay station is quite complicated and it's expensive).
4895,Pure luxury with hassle free vacationing and access for everyone!
4896,"This place is a maze of red lounges, yellow lounges and blue lounges, with umpteen different exits and only some are wheelchair-accessible. What’s more, there’s only toilets beyond the ticket barriers, which are very difficult to get through if you have a wheelchair: a Virgin Trains staff member has to come and let you through the keypad gates to the side of the main gates. There is also very little room in some of the platforms and sometimes the platforms change without notice, and being in a wheelchair, you don’t have time to change platforms.

No Braille markings on any platforms or any safety information in Braille.

"
4897,Staff were really alert. I only had to come within 50 feet of anyone for them to rush over and tell me all about the nearest lifts and ramps. Top marks.
4898,"The building has several accessible toilets. All equipped and finished to a high standard. 

However, for us the crowning glory was the discovery of a Changing Places Toilet. Handily tucked away at the side of the tour reception hall.

Beautifully equipped and decorated to exactly the same high specification as all the other toilets. No medical looking white grab rails in this set up!"
4899,Accessible and toilets are clear and generally quite clean. 
4900,"Overall fully accessible, stopped off in the tearoom for a late lunch, lovely home produce. Staff happy to help and carry anything needed ,be it in the garden centre or to carry food and drink to your table. Plenty of room to manoeuvre and look at things in the shop & garden centre. Wheelchairs provided for those less mobile. The only thing that wasn’t quite right, was the ramp to access tearoom and upper level, was very steep and long"
4901,"Limited signage, for visitors to the museum this is more than adequate via lifts, doors are wide as the concourse areas"
4902,Access around the gardens is great as there are hard surfaced paths for most parts. There are also some wheelchair accessible paths that are signposted by the rock gardens. The glasshouse tour is fabulous as you work your way through the glasshouses and the different climates. I particularly like the automatic doors that make getting around so much easier as a wheelchair user.
4903,Access very tight but worth it as food was fantastic
4904,"Mahastí is a wonderful single storey cottage at Epotx Etxea, high above Getaria in the Pais Vasco or Spanish Basque Country. 
It sleeps four in two bedrooms, and there is the bathroom and a kitchen-dining-sitting room combined, plus the terrace where you can sit in the shade of the wide eaves and gaze at the fabulous view of the sea and the coast and also eat meals as there is another dining table and chairs there. 
It’s all very neat and clean and beautifully done with pretty tiles and curtains and very well-equipped for basic cooking, plus there was a bottle of home-produced txacolí (white wine) in the fridge! Unusually for Spain, it has an oven as well as a microwave, although no kettle – but who wants abroad to be just like home?!
The garden is lovely, with lots of birds, flowers and is trees, including a lemon, an orange and a fig tree, plus more outdoor furniture on the lawn and a serious barbecue! 
Although walkers passed up and down the road that leads to Epotx, it is quite a trek to Getaria and involves a few hairpin bends – you would probably want to go by car. Getaria itself is on quite a slope and although it has some beach (including beach wheelchairs) it is a working port. For more of a resort, pop along to Zarautz to the east, which has a great long promenade with cafés, accessible loos (and two different kinds of beach wheelchair!) and is a very accessible place all round, what with drop kerbs and smooth surfaces. It also has some sort of wooden beach walkway, although we didn’t actually seek it out, as there was plenty of prom to explore anyway. 
Zumaia, to the west also has a prom, this time by the river and very pleasant. 
I booked Mahastí through Handiscover, but if we were to go again it’s cheaper to book directly. Andrés and Maikar are incredibly friendly and can provide lots of useful information but they do not intrude - the perfect hosts! 

"
4905,My husband and I booked to stay in the Isles of Glencoe Hotel for 3 nights from 10th November 2021. We were given room 316. We left after 2 nights as I was finding it too difficult to manage with only one grab rail for the toilet. It should not be described as accessible for a wheelchair user. I tried using the disabled toilet near the dining room. It has only one grab rail that be used for support. It should not be described as accessible for a wheelchair user either.
4906,"All level access with automatic doors. Shops and toilets with good access. Lifts to allow passengers to travel to different platforms, if stairs are not an option."
4907,"Glasgow is known as  the 'Dear Green Place,' with Kelvingrove being one of its many parks.
Around the river Kelvin, in the West end of the city, this is a lovely big park.
Today I visited on a rainy, dreich (miserable), March afternoon, so it wasn't looking at its best. Some spectacular puddles though, rivaling the river itself!"
4908,Very friendly staff obliging and helpful. Food excellent in the view across the river is wonderful. Access is very easy and staff are willing to move things around to accommodate larger wheelchairs.
4909,We drove to the coffee shop and it was relatively easy to get to. There were 15 disabled car parking spaces  and evrey single car parking space had the proper room to get my mobility scooter out of the car so I was very pleased.
4910,"The website has no mention of accessibility so we rang to ensure it was suitable for a wheelchair user and they confirmed that it was. When we arrived I was a little daunted as it’s a very old but beautiful building that was formally a bank and had been converted into a restaurant but kept all the features such as the old wood panelling and stained glass windows. The daunting bit was a very steep set of stone stairs leading into the restaurant. We could see no sign for disabled access.
One of our party went inside to enquire about disabled access and we were told to “go round the back” and someone would meet us. This was a little confusing as there were a couple of doors we passed but as there was no one there we continued around until we found a gated yard which was clearly a shared access to several buildings including the back entrance to the restaurant. The gate was opened by a staff member who let us in and showed us to the back entrance. If I had been alone, meeting others in the restaurant then I would have been unable to access it and would either have had to ask a passer by to go into the restaurant to ask for help, phone the restaurant from outside to get in or call whoever I was meeting for help, hoping they had got there before me.
When we got into the restaurant someone had parked their large mobility scooter in an area that would allow access straight to our table but it simply meant that I had to go around the edge of the restaurant and through the bar area to get to where my party was sitting.
Inside there were several tables in an enclosed area in the centre of the room which could have been alittle awkward to negotiate in a wheelchair but we were seated on a table around the outside which 
was absolutely fine for access.
We had a real issue when we left as there was no staff member available to assist us we had to get out on our own and the gate had a magnet release a couple of meters before the gate itself and we had an issue with the fact that the gate was so heavy that it took us a couple of tries and in the end a passerby helped my mother and I get out of the yard. "
4911,"Even seasoned festival-goers couldn't understand why the condition of toilets at this festival was so bad by day one! We managed to find a permanent public toilet beside the local cafe which was usable, and there was a disabled loo there. It was being used by everyone by the looks of it though. I did not see signage for any other accessible toilets - although they will have been there."
4912,Plan in advance no toilets en-route
4913,"We drove to the Bonnie Badgers and parked on a nearby side street.  There is a bus stop just outside the hotel but there is no train station in Gullane.
"
4914,The square itself does not have staff. The toilet and cafe staff were helpful.
4915,Didn't need staff assistance because access very good. No complaints.
4916,"Although not very noticeable, there are limited blue badge parking spaces located at the back of the theatre, but the distance from the car park to the building is appropriate"
4917,Ramp and sign at entrance good but two sets of doors to get through which were quite heavy. Couldn't see means of summoning staff help.  There were a few - albeit small - changes in the floor to look out for (I was on crutches today and the floor was a bit bumpy in places) but it wasn't a major issue. Nicely carpeted with no steps. Plenty of room to get a wheelchair through.  I was delighted to be able to take my dog in.
4918,There is step free access to the premises. With the coffee shop being so big it is easy moving around inside. There are seats on the pavement outside and also ramped access to a seating area at the back.
4919,Several blue badge parking bays in the carpark
4920,"The access in to the centre is level from the car park. The front door and gym are accessed via automatic doors, which was great. There are two lifts to get you down to the pool area, one from the gym and another beside the cafe area.  

The gym has a handcycle for use as well as many other machines that worked for me as a manual wheelchair user. The staff can work with you to show you all of the machines that would be useful to you, and are also available (with membership) to assist you during your visit. You can book this assistance in advance to be sure that support will be available when you attend.

There is a main swimming pool, which has hoist access. There is also a smaller swimming pool, which is much warmer and has hoist access too. 

The only reason the centre didn't get 5 stars for access, is that there is a slight slope from the  car park to the front door which some manual wheelchair users might find tricky. "
4921,"Level, smooth access throughout. No carpet and good space between all tables. Excellent to see a variety of table shapes, styles and heights ( and chair styles).  Staff have been good with communication when my speech wasn't clear, polite and attentive. I've heard one or more staff signs in BSL. Easy read menu with small portion options.  Staff who know me have included a straw with my drink. These things plus great food makes us go back regularly. "
4922,"Most of the access is level, with surfaces ranging from paved, to grass to compacted earth. Some paths not accessible due to uneven surfaces or to weather conditions. Bridges mostly accessible as is the bird hide but you may need to work out the best way to reach this. There is a map and the bridges themselves are numbered which makes it easy. Lots of seats at regular intervals."
4923,The staff were extremely helpful both in accessing the main door using the portable ramp and also helping make space for the wheelchair at the table and providing things like straws et cetera.
4924,"There is no on-site parking as it's located on a pedestrianised precinct but it's only a few minutes walk from parking in the Eastgate Centre nearby; it's also a few minutes walk from the train and bus stations.
On-street parking is a bit further away and it can difficult to get a disabled space, especially at the time of day when I visited."
4925,"They did meet us on the platform! But it was the wrong platform! And we were just abandoned after that, not the best!"
4926,"Being of a certain age with a bus pass I went to Glasgow from Edinburgh, using the service 900 from the bus station. I was very surprised given the excellent access to the lower level departure area via lift. Not the dingy old bus station I remember as a child. Fully modernised with disabled Access toilets with RADAR access, all on one level. There were amenities for travelers such as hot cold drinks, foods, magazines, papers. There were also left luggage stores and a large information area. The staff could not have been more helpful at the station and on the bus. The nearest public transport access is the Tram, with buses on three corners of the square stopping at most 200m from the Bus Station  "
4927,The staff have a great attitude and always make an effort to make sure my visit is the best it can be.
4928,Staff were friendly and helpful when asked for advice and information
4929,"As an electric wheelchair user the access was good.  Chris and Chrissie, the owners, were willing to move any furniture necessary. There was ramped access to the front door and flagstone paving all around the cottage so that you could access the patio.  Inside the house the doors were wide enough, and no tight corners.  The floor surfaces were floorboards, slate tiles and heavy carpet, fine for electric wheelchair. The open plan living room/kitchen was level and accessible, we pushed some furniture to the side easily.  Our mobile hoist fitted easily under the bed and there was plenty of room in the bedroom for electric wheelchair and mobile hoist."
4930,"All toilets were clean & tidy and there were 3 Changing places toilets (Village Centre, Swimming Pool Changing Room & Indoor Sports Centre Complex"
4931,Not being sure of quite what to expect it was great to discover the range of performances and opportunities on offer for disabled people.
4932,"The cobbles on the listed paving outside are not comfortable but once you are inside, it is a smooth, pleasant journey with lifts to each floor. Some great art, gift shop and a cafe."
4933,Helpful staff.
4934,Good accessible toilet in the Bistro.
4935,As mentioned in a previous review the only slight issue was the cobbles for a short time to get to the entrance of the restuarant. This is not really a problem and as I was in an electric wheelchair you just have to go for it &  laugh😀 Once I at the entrance to the restuarant very straightforward access. The staff are very friendly & helpful.
4936,"The bus station does not have a car park of its own due to the close proximity to the city centre. However, there is a car park in Buchanan galleries which is very close to the bus station. There is also a taxi rank located at the rear of the bus station. "
4937,"The staff couldn't be friendlier. They are found working in the cafes, shops and offices, or out working on the ground. Everyone I encountered was happy to offer assistance."
4938,The staff are amazing.
4939,"The nearest train and tube station is London Bridge, which has limited step free access. From London Bridge tube or train station exit at St Thomas Street and café is about 5 minutes walk away. There are several buses that stop close by."
4940,"Superdrug is generally accessible throughout. No bell on the door but it is usually open, except in winter. Level entrance. Mobile induction hearing loop is available and there is Braille support on some products/bottles. No seating available. Door width 840mm, expandable to 1170mm, till height 900mm. "
4941,I am very impressed with the wide spaces and loads of roomy lifts to take you between levels. Staff are out wiping surfaces clean so felt Covid safe. The centre is open at each side so very airy. The accessible toilet worked for me: it is spacious and clean. They even have a Changing Places toilet.
4942,"Piccolino is a very easily accessible Italian restaurant, with plenty of space to sit inside or outside. It is good quality but fairly expensive. The immediate surrounding area includes other bars/restaurants, the Peace Gardens and the Winter Gardens. These spaces are all open, attractive and accessible."
4943,"There is no no designated parking for Brambles itself. However, nearby, there are a number of Blue Badge designated spaces, which are adjacent to the main thoroughfare. For non Blue Badge holders free (off season) parking (paid Mar-Nov) are available on Main Street or The Avenue. Holiday weekends and the summer season can be especially busy with cars, touring buses and bikers. 
The nearest railway station is 17 miles away at Dalmally.

4944,"At the back of the coffee shop, on the left. There is a small (2 inch) step up from the pavement into the shop."
4945,"As explained in part one review, it’s handy as near to hotels entrance, but difficult to then get in via the ramp, as told in part one, so please read that as it shows you how to get in."
4946,I booked this holiday with TUI and I stayed there for one week. There was an easy to use hydraulic pool lift making it easy for me to use the pool with some help. There was a large spaced accessible toilet in the lobby close to the pool and bar. The bedroom was not huge and the wet room was not quite big enough for a wheelchair The shower chair was a bit wobbly so I used one of the balcony chairs instead which was a lot more sturdy.  There are two beaches nearby that have floating wheelchairs which can be used for free.
4947,"While Nom de Plume is sadly not the most accessible cafe in Edinburgh, the warm welcome you receive when you visit is fabulous! I've never had a bad visit, and staff are always upbeat and friendly. Unfortunately there are a set of stairs to get into the cafe, and a narrow staircase down to the ladies toilets."
4948,"The inside of the toilet was very clean (a new venue!) and completely satisfactory to my lack of mobility needs (it even had a mirror!).  However, the access to the loo was blocked by a pushchair......"
4949,"There was a spacious lift. We were in screen 13 and it did not have an access box therefore the accessible seating was at the front, meaning that we were sitting too close to the screen. "
4950,"The Green Room is a bistro restaurant on Upper Gorund right behind the National Theatre. It is in a modern building with no steps or even slopes from the street to the tables, which contain props from National Theatre productions."
4951,"The staff were helpful and friendly, they brought over the gluten free cakes for me to see (they have a good range of gluten and dairy free food and milk alternatives). They offered to help with the doors and moved chairs out the way for me"
4952,There are good bus links and there is some nearby on street parking.
4953,The accessible loo would have been fine if it hadn't had 2 nappy bins in it! I pointed this out to the staff who were very obliging and said they'd take one out.
4954,Excellent.
4955,Overall the staff and venue provide a good/enjoyable option and experience for this wheelchair user/companion.
4956,"The assistance staff let the train station down. I've regularly been forgotten about, and even once taken to the wrong train. Often they're confrontational if assistance isn't booked in advance. "
4957,"All staff were exceptionally welcoming and friendly,  and appeared to accept a number of my comments."
4958,Quite large toilet with enough room for a carer/aide. Has grab rails. Easily accessible but no/little signage so would have to ask staff where it is.
4959,"There is disabled parking which is very handy but the public transport is a bit bad, you need to get off at the bus stop at the top of the gravel road."
4960,"To get to Snow Factor, we entered the Soar building and got the central lift up to level 2. We saw the area for Snow Factor and went in and first it seemed unclear how to get there as there were stairs. To get down to Snow Factor, you go into the cafe and theres a small lift to get down. It only fit me in my powerchair and one other person at a time. Once down I was greeted out the lift by the ski instructer. She told me the temperature and asked if I had warmer clothes and I got changed. We started to go through to the slope and I was provided with a helmet. The instructer then said my assistant could watch from the cafe or come in, they went upstairs where it was warmer. It then came to getting out my chair into the sit-ski and we realised we should have kept my assistant around! I transfered myself and the instructor held the ski as it would fall over otherwise, we had to leave my wheelchair and bag at the door. The instructor pushed me out onto the ice then asked a few members of staff to help hold the ski while she secured me in with straps. We went to get hoisted up the slope. I had been feeling confident but this wasn’t ideal, it took many attemps to ‘hook’ me on to be pulled up. Straps were attached to my sit-ski, they went past the sides of my face and were kind of hooked around the pully system (see picture), they weren’t attached and because it kept falling off at first I felt like it would detach and hit me in the face! Thankfully it did not and after the first time going up it went smoothly. At the top these straps fall off and the metal hit me hard on my knee. The instructor got a jacket to put over my legs as extra padding but she was able to pull this aside for all other runs so it didn’t hit me again but instead fell off to the side. Communication improved and things went smoothly after this. I felt more relaxed again and was able to really enjoy the skiing. I felt comfortable in the sit-ski and felt more confident with the instructor. The instructor holds on to the back of the sit-ski and guides it down the slope. You can use your weight to go left and right as guided. "
4961,"Trinity kitchen can be accessed via a lift and has plenty of space inside to move around, most parts are well lit though there are some darker areas, Each food counter is easy to approach and there is a large ramp to reach the lower level. Tables are spaced out well and are at a lower height to be easy to access. "
4962,"New Build, facilities for less abled vast improvement On previous facility.
Fully wheelchair accessible 
Facilities for hard of hearing
Consideration to less abled carefully thought through"
4963,"Excellent, found them all very helpful and easily identifiable."
4964,"I've been going here for years as one of my favourite restaurants is here, when I was more able bodied it wasn’t a problem but I'm more disabled now and can't used escalators or stairs anymore.

The best thing is the disabled parking which is free if you register your blue badge and car at the information desk. It's also on the upper level of the shopping centre so you don't have to worry about lifts. 

The restaurants as family accessible there's a slight slight doe to them and a lift at the other end if you want to go to those on the lower level.

However, going to the shops on the lower level of shops is difficult if you have mobility issues and can’t handle escalators and steps. After the escalators there are four or five steps which kind of makes things difficult if you can handle escalators but not stairs. I can’t even use escalators now. There are two lifts to the lower ground floor but they are a long walk from the other lifts that are in the same corridor as the entrance to the car park.

The place is huge and although there is a one way system for COVID-19 it's too far for me to walk what they expect. There is so much space you don’t really need a one-way system to help with social distancing.

I do what I can, I’m wearing a mask and using two crutches. They have marshals at times and they take one look at me and don’t try to get me to use the one way system as it blatantly is too difficult. "
4965,"There is a hotel car park with barrier entry and exit and several disabled parking spaces at the back of the hotel right near the hotel entrance doors.
I cannot comment on public transport as I arrived by car
The hotel is on a hill so it is a bit of a push in a manual chair to get down to the riverside"
4966,"The staff are lovely, offer table service, smile with you and make you feel comfortable. They will help you in there as well or as much or little that you require. "
4967,Very close to Pimlico underground station. 
4968,"Very helpful both at box office , ushers , bar and restaurant staff."
4969,"The staff were friendly, chatty and helpful. They were patient and attentive."
4970,Disabled parking directly outside. The road is cobbled. Typical old town style. You have to parallel park so if you require a chair to come out the back of the vehicle then this could be problematic. 
4971,"There were bumpy, uneven and slightly raised floors in several sections of the aquarium, which meant using my crutches was difficult. The lift was okay, but there wasn't adequate signage to tell disabled visitors where to go after going to the second floor. It was good to be able to get a free carer ticket, but I wasn't impressed with having to phone up rather than being able to use their website. I can't use the phone so I had to ask my mum to call and book for me."
4972,"The toilets are in the enteranceway to the restaurant with the disabled toilet on the left, it can be difficult to access if busy. On a previous visit the toilet was locked from outside and you had to ask staff for access, no radar key system is in use. This time though toilet was unlocked.

The toilet does have enough space go get in but would pose a challenge for a carer to assist. 

They do have a red cord but this was trapped behind the grab rail hinge, and was unable to free it."
4973,Accessible toilet is easy to find - its by the other toilets. It is clean and spacious. Room to manouevre and room for a carer
4974,really easy by car bus train or tram
4975,"The Vagina Museum is housed inside Camden Market. There are different parts of Camden Market so it can be a little confusing if you are not familiar with the layout. The museum is in the Stables Market. The entrance is on Chalk Farm Road, see my photo of the entrance. 

From the market entrance make directly towards Cyberdog, with the two large robots standing outside its entrance, see photo. Then turn right into the alleyway where Dr Martens is, where the Christmas tree is in my photo. Then take the next turning on the left, into the alleyway with a flight of stairs on the left hand side and a bridge connecting the buildings on both sides. Continue walking and the museum is further up on the right hand side, see photo.

The walk from the market entrance to the museum should only take 2 -3 minutes, however, there are cobblestones throughout the market area, see photos, so take care. These are old and very worn. Some of the cobblestones are raised. I think they would be quite slippery if wet. 

The Vagina Museum is entirely on the ground floor and has step free access. There is a permanent slope at the entrance and the rest of the museum is level. On the left there is a book and gift shop. Items are on shelves of varying height. 

On the right is the information desk, at standing height. Admission to the museum is free, apart from paid special events, so someone is at the desk to assist with questions/ provide information. 

The museum space is quite small. It is the size of two large rooms and this makes it easy to get round. In the centre of the museum gallery space is a bench, without back support or arms to aid transferring. The museum also offer additional seating if required.

The museum is well laid out and spacious. There are a lot of information boards with different coloured background and black text. "
4976,"This brilliant country park is a privately owned trust which specialises in providing sanctuary for wildfowl, ducks, geese etc as well as otters, ospreys and insects.  Entrance is slightly expensive but if you live locally you can sign up for an annual pass to gain entry.  They offer a guide which shows the wheelchair accessible pathways, some of which are metalled and are easy going for self-propelled or attendance chairs others which might need a powerchair to get around.  The Millennium Garden is a complete joy but there are talks on their red squirrel and conservancy programs as well as at 4 pm their bird feeding time which is an absolutely wonderful experience.
The restaurant offers a selection of foods from full meals to sandwiches, cakes and snacks.  It is totally accessible.  The loos are also easily accessed with plenty of room for chairs or transfers.  The bird hides out near the lake are also accessible but you will need to traverse some rather rough pathways to access them.
There is a children's play area but having none to test it out I cannot comment on its accessibility.  Dogs are not allowed as the birds are allowed to run freely."
4977,Good access to the front of Town hall with electronic controlled doors
4978,Flat access parking very good
4979,"Really good! It starts with a wide ramp at the entrance. There are lifts for all the different floors. Exhibits including ipads etc are at decent heights. And corridors are wide enough for people to pass by each other. The one area that was a little bit difficult to navigate was the ""Tokens"" area on the ground floor - but that was because it was busy in general. In the brochure we were given there was a map with the main exhibit areas and showing the accessible loos. Think they may also have wheelchair(s) for public use as I did see one near the entrance. I saw subtitles on video exhibits and there were also headphones for audio exhibits."
4980,"Arriving I wheeled through the handily automatic doors and headed along the illuminated corridor to the welcome desk. A sense of anticipation commenced as you weren't too sure what to expect. A cheery greeting, collection of tickets and our adventure began.

The ""barrel ride"" made me think of something from Alton Towers and horrific rides. Rest assured it wasn't anything like that! More akin to the graceful swans on the boating lake. We boarded our barrel, which had an access platform and companion seat, and glided gently through an array of colourful scenes which set out the story of whisky production. 

Well informed we moved on to what I'll call the cinema with a film and guided story. The images were projected onto what felt like three sides of the room and were very immersive. If you experience sea sickness then brace yourself as it did feel like you were moving along with the landscapes!

On into the blender room, a touch of Victoriana and sense of going back in time. The holographic whisky bottles and the old man appearing ghost like in the picture on the wall to tell the story were a big hit. A chance to choose a dram from one of the regions we'd heard about when using the sensory cards earlier. One small, observation was the colours on the table surfaces weren't too clear and it was hard to see which was which ... 

Next was simply my favourite piece .... as if by magic a door appears in the wooden panelling of the room. It has a safe like look about with an enormous rotary handle. Lots of clunking sounds and squeaks as the door opens very slowly to reveal a few bottles on shelves in the distance. I wheeled in, although I knew what was coming, I still got an enormous sense of excitement as turning the corner here I was faced with the full array of the collection's near on 4,000 bottles!

Time to explore, to photograph, to discuss, to ask questions, and to simply enjoy. Then on to the bar for the tasting!"
4981,"Spacious lift brings you up, completely flat smooth floors with lots of space."
4982,has a bus running to it lots of parking and is on the flat so ideal for all abilities and ages
4983,"Staff are friendly extremely helpful, happy and cheerful.
We were welcomed with refreshments.  Great day out.    Despite the wet weather a good time was had by all."
4984,"It was a rather wet day when we had a trip to Whitely Bay, and had not actually heard of the Tynemouth Aquarium and just spotted it when driving past.
I am really pleased we spotted it and enjoyed seeing what was on display
"
4985,Staff did very well to help get a specific room that would accommodate my needs and were available for any more assistance
4986,Disabled toilets are positioned along the length of the mall. They were clean although on a few occasions soap has not been available. The toilets are large enough to comfortably maneuver my wheelchair 
4987,Great accessible bathroom with rails etc. Small issue was there's a ramp up to the door which makes it hard to pull it open at an angle (see picture)
4988,Staff were friendly. 
4989,please see my review
4990,"Every member of staff I met was unfailingly helpful, kind and interested in me as an individual."
4991,"I do not think there cottages could be any more accessible. No steps or thresholds to overcome, and doors are wide enough for specialist wheelchairs. Open plan kitchen and dining area to allow wheelchair access and low worktops. Large living area with television. Plenty of activities in the surrounding area including Blackpool Pleasure Beach which is also level flat ground and only 5 miles drive."
4992,The loo is set the back of the cafe they will give you a key it's low rent but otherwise perfect for what is required
4993,"Transport to dancebase was probably its weakest point. There was a bus service running along the Grassmarket and some taxis were in evidence. You do have to walk, or wheel in my case, some distance from any parking space or bus stops. It was worth the effort so worth a try if you can ..."
4994,Very helpful! Especially when my pal was standing so close to a painting that he set an alarm off! There was a staff member close at hand at all times and willing to answer questions.
4995,The disabled parking is relatively suitable.
4996,"Access from the car park is straight through a same level door then through sliding doors to reception which is wheelchair friendly.  The lift is at the end of reception.  There is a range of toilets, including disabled, at this level.  On the first floor you will find the cafe and adjacent to that there is a range of seating comprising sofas and single chair ranged around the wind tunnel.  There are also more toilets in the changing room."
4997,The owners of the farm are lovely .  They were always useful when we ask them for advice and very relaxed .
4998,"Up to date accessible, well planned and designed toilet and bathing facilities and a first class new laundry and drying room."
4999,good food and pleasant staff meant a relaxing lunch
5000,"Straight in off the street with powerchair. Was easy to get around the gallery, cafe and garden."
5001,"Parking for disabled right outside the main entrance to the right of the door, "
5002,Big enough for a large electric wheelchair at a diagonal angle.
5003,Right outside couldn't be easier
5004,"Clean & tidy accessible toilets that had fold up grab rails are available on all levels.
The actual toilet pan is of standard height, not raised.
Plenty of room for wheelchair and/or assistant."
5005,Really good! As we approached the entrance gates I wondered if there would be steps - but nope it was step free. The paths were tarmaced and kept clean and without obstructions. There were bridges to cross over to the other parts of the park and although they were sloped they were all step free. There are benches and places to sit throughout the park. Plus there is no skating or cycling which makes the experience even better as you're not having to look over your shoulder the whole time.
5006,Costa coffee Saltcoats is a nice place to stop if you’re in town. The coffee has an accessible toilet which is quite small. The toilet has handrails around it there are manual doors at the front of the cafe Which you would need assistance with.
5007,Very easy to find and lots disabled parking right by entrance.  Around 20 spots.
5008,Very helpful and friendly - not just the ramp and the table butt the general attitude. Service was good too - the waiter was helpful with our order as well.
5009,I walked from Liverpool city centre but there is a car park a out 5 minutes from the bar with all day parking - I'm not sure on whether there are accessible parking spots though. The Baltic Triangle is a popular part of Liverpool and so there are buses from across the city that stop nearby 
5010,"The door to get in was large and considerably heavy, may require assistance to open. "
5011,"Visited the SSE Hydro to see The 1975 as a birthday treat and had a fantastic time! From booking tickets to actually accessing the show, everything was so smooth."
5012,"Spaces are limited to only 3 wheelchairs in Cappielow, so contact must be made via your club  Office   but you are well sheltered
VIEWING.
The Viewing area is shared with the disabled Home supporters, and is a covered area beside the teams’ dug-outs."
5013,"The accessible loo is a bit tired looking, see pic, needs upgrading but it does what t says on the tin?!"
5014,"An OK restaurant, but had to move other patrons from tables to access loo."
5015,There are disabled toilets on all levels. One disabled toilet on both the first floor and the lower ground floor and two on the ground floor (although one of these was out of order on my visit). There are grab rails and the toilets were clean and tidy. The lower ground floor toilet was especially large although all the toilets were quite spacious. The toilets were all unlocked so easily accessible. 
5016,"There is step-free access into all screens; the cinema is on the first floor, accessed via a lift in the Leisure Complex foyer. Ticket sales are in the cinema foyer on the first floor. CEA cards may be used when purchasing tickets to receive a complementary ticket for a PA/carer/companion, and these tickets can also be booked online. There are heavy double doors into each of the screens, and assistance may be required with these. Each of the screens has some step-free seating and dedicated wheelchair spaces, though in most these are situated close to the screen."
5017,Automatic doors and slight bump ramp to get through the main entrance.
5018,"Lots of buses stop nearby
Is usually parking available in the street."
5019,"We did not find disabled toilets, just public, and these were beside lounge by the bar.
They were just plain basic cubicle tiled toilets, no grab rails or pull cord. You will not get chair into cubicles though."
5020,Great! There is step free access throughout and a lift to all floors. There are push pads for the doors at the entrance. The aisles are wide .
5021,100% :)
5022,Very helpful.
5023,Accessible parking in centre carpark although not too close. Good bus service close by.
5024,"I have found in German Airports especially - the attention to detail and provision o wide spaces, lifts and moving flat escalators is superb. Of toileting facilities most are standardised and excellent. You know what is available and they are well serviced. Good signage and direction."
5025,Parking right outside the garden gate enough for three  cars
5026,"No ramp required, flat, consistent surface"
5027,The entrance into the cafe/foyer area is not huge but manageable and the staff were helpful and explained the best route around the garden for us. The cafe (see photo) sells excellent food at reasonable prices and the staff were very helpful. I would agree with one of the other reviewers that there was not much space between the tables but I have been to lots of places which are more cramped and I still managed. 
5028,Book ahead to make sure you get a table that is suitable and to let the patron know you have a wheelchair as there is a step but they have a ramp to overcome this.  The toilets are not suitable so make sure you go beforehand.  The food is typically French and to a high standard.
5029,"I travelled by Public Transport (Luas) from the City Centre Red Zone, bound for Tallaght and got off at  St James Street which was approx an 5-7 minute wheel from the Luas stop.

"
5030,"Parking spaces available in the church yard, but having to go round three sides of the church is a nuisance, particularly for someone with a walking stick. Bus stops nearby."
5031,"I spent a great week here as a group of 6. Spacious rooms and bathroom upstairs for the mobile and large bedroom and wet room downstairs for the less mobile. Set in beautiful, quiet surroundings and dog friendly.
I'll definitely return as I couldn't fault it in any way.
More photos and details here 
https://aberdeenshireluxurylodges.com/ "
5032,"Accessible loo, good limited food access, some steps"
5033,"The Arriva 26 bus stops near by but you do have to either cross the car park or go down road to get into the centre.

There is a parking space but it is very small."
5034,"This can get busy sometimes, so it might be a tight squeeze for a wheelchair or powerchair user especially by the counter as they have some tables opposite this area which narrows the ability to pass along the counter. I couldn't read the labels on products or see the men behind the counter, but staff were helpful enough."
5035,Doors not easy to open. Very heavy with a chair or walking aids
5036,Might be a bit small for large wheelchair. Fine for my light one.
5037,"We walked to the Colosseum, but later in the trip we began to use the metro and there is a very convenient stop immediately outside the entrance."
5038,"There is a car park for all visitors who stay in this hotel. There is a bus stop in front of this hotel and also, the Tainan train station just next to this hotel."
5039,One side has steps and the other side is fully accessible.
5040,Valley view is all on one level with no steps to manoeuvre. Doors are wide enough to comfortably get a wheelchair through.  The cooker and sink are on a unit that is alterable according to height need as is the basin  in the bathroom and dressing table in the bedroom. 
5041,"Private, secure car park, with plenty of rooms for cars.."
5042,Accessible toilets including Changing Places. 
5043,"There were two disabled toilets , one in the cafe which was hidden behind a staff area and was difficult to find, I had to go past produce in packaging to get to it It was a bit of a squash getting past this produce to get to the loo and the loo it's self was quite small but do able. The other was in the museum whilst it was a bit roomier it was a bit of a squeeze to get my chair around."
5044,Accessible permanent ramp to entrance and automatic doors which make life easy. Some angled planters to stop cars parking and blocking ramp are a good idea but makes turning tight which could be an issue for larger chairs. Lack of lowered kerb an street pavement means a short journey in the road to get in or out of entry to/from hotel
5045,The toilets were modern well laid out and bright and cheerful. The one I visited was spacious and had enough room for my powerchair and a couple of other people. The doors were wide and painted / treated with bright yellow finishes which made them easy to see. No feeling of sitting in a white box with this room.
5046,As a form of transport the River Bus is great and the piers are well placed for accessing other forms of transport.
5047,"The nearest tube/ train station is London Bridge. London Bridge tube has limited step free access. From the tube/ train station take the  St Thomas Street exit, and it's a 5 minute walk. There are several buses that stop nearby. The museum is a distinctive orange building, so it stands out and easy to find."
5048,Good wheelchair access throughout. This building also contains Job Centre Plus and Riverside Library. 
5049,"Although the main body of this hotel is wheelchair friendly and the staff and food are lovely the bedroom I was allocated as being wheelchair friendly is definitely not.  The room did not provide enough space to move freely, the walk in shower was not good for someone dependant on a wheelchair, the toilet was far too low, the sink was too high and there was only one grab rail beside the toilet.  Also the bed was so high I had to be manhandled up in to bed and required to wake my husband up twice during the night to get me back into bed.  This I was told was the only room suitable for disabled wheelchair users.
The room would possibly  suit ambulant disabled people."
5050,Really nice and will assist in any way that they can.
5051,"Reasonable sized toilet with all the grab rails etc and the toilet is separate from the main toilets so it can be less busy, but there is no radar key so it gets used by anybody"
5052,Wheelchair access at this venue is almost impossible to fault.
5053,Flat all the way to the bar
5054,Very good
5055,"90% of the cathedral is accessible, there are ramps throughout. There is a small chapel at the rear of the cathedral that you can't access. There is a platform lift into the cafe at the back, which is also where the accessible toilet is located with an automatic entry door (push button)."
5056,I saw no specific disabled parking for the hotel. We were able to always park near to the rear of the hotel.
5057,"The venue was well signposted with a ramp to the entrance, with level access at the front entrance and inside the building. There is a choice of five different escape rooms, with the escape room that my friends and I were attempting to escape from being really accessible. Throughout the venue there was plenty of room to manoeuvre, with staff prepared to make any adjustments required to accommodate access needs."
5058,We came as pedestrians. Parking likely tricky given it's on a busy road but there are lots of buses running up North Bridge.
5059,"We have been taking my disabled daughter here since she was very young and she is now in her 20's and continues to love visiting regularly. There is never any problem with her carers being allowed entry for free with our membership card. There are many interesting wheelchair accessible paths through a varied landscape with many ponds with a great variety of wildfowl. The  wheelchair accessible centre includes a cafe which has good food and snacks and the whole atmosphere is very relaxed throughout, with friendly helpful staff and interesting things to look at.  You can bring a picnic and eat inside or out. 
If the weather is not good you can sit inside and view lots of ducks though the large windows. There are  a range of activites for 
children too and a good gift shop. The only drawback is the standard disabled toilet, without change bed and hoist which limits our time there."
5060,Friendly and helpful
5061,"There was barrier free access from the car park to reception, the restaurant and to our room. 
Room 2 is located about ten metres from the lift, via a manual opening door.  The lift is a little tight for a wheelchair user with luggage, but that is to be expected as the building has been repurposed. 
Breakfast and dinner is served in the restaurant, Forme & Chase.  For wheelchair access go through the bar area and turn left, where you will find the wheelchair lift to the restaurant level.
We didn’t use the Generators rooftop bar as there was a private function on the first night and we were too tired the second night.  From the photos it does look accessible for a wheelchair user though. 
"
5062,The disability toilets are situated in various areas around the cinema and are all very accessible with large amounts of room to manoeuvre inside in a wheelchair or a mobility scooter.
5063,The nearest bus stop is about a ten minute walk away. It is down a slightly narrow pavement and the acces to the centre involves walking for a short way along the access road which is very smooth
5064,"There are a few parking spaces designated to Absolute Dogs right outside the shop. They aren’t sign posted as accessible parking however, they aren’t marked with any lines at all. Whenever I have visited there has always been plenty of room beside my car. One of the parking spaces is right outside the entrance to Absolute Dogs which could be difficult however, there has always been space between cars and the entrance when I’ve visited.

Due to being located in the city centre of Dundee there are bus stops coming from all over Dundee, I’m not sure what ones or where these are.
"
5065,"A well deserved five stars. When we arrived we didn't expect to find the dedicated parking bays so that was a big plus. Next to come to mind as is often the case; was where is the loo? Seeing the toilet block it was not obvious if there would be an accessible loo. A wheel around to the other side of the building and there was an accessible toilet. 

Next on the agenda was a stroll through and amongst the trees. It was great to discover a firm tarmac path and so curiosity took over as we wheeled along it. After a short distance the trees became thinner and you appeared to go uphill a little. At the top the surprise was delivered as here was a wheelchair accessible view point where you could look down on to the sandy beach. The lines of concrete blocks marking the defences from invasion. 

A little further round and the tarmac path turns into a wooden boardwalk where you can wheel along between the sand dunes and down on to a lower viewing platform at the top of the beach. Great views and the sense of being on the beach like everyone else but without the sand in your wheels and the usual sinking feeling as you contemplate whether beaches and wheelchair were particularly compatible. For the brave at heart the boardwalk continues right down on to the sands of the beach if you want to try that.

Well signposted walks were way marked, as well as being able to pick up a map at the information point, and you could choose where you wanted to explore. each well documented in the leaflet and clear indications of time and terrain.

In the main open area there was a children's playground as well as spaces for barbecuing.

All in all a real good find!"
5066,Good all around place staff was great and helpful lift for wheelchair was a bit tight but working well did book to go this year but Corona virus stopped me they gave me a call and got full refund 
5067,"I found the shop to be fascinating from an access point of view. Great glass windows so you could see in with a wide easy access door to wheel in to browse.

Once inside there's plenty of space to browse and a really nice environment. It felt more than just a shop; almost an art space. Even a sofa if you fancy a rest and chat with the staff!"
5068,There's a multitude of parking areas around the lake - or loch! We drove and found parking spaces easily. Getting there by public transport is a little tricker - Motherwell is the nearest train station and I didn't see any bus stops when we were in the Park.
5069,"The church is located near the centre of Bracknell & is easily accessible by road, rail & bus, being only a few minutes from both the bus & rail stations. The church has two bulidings; the main building (Kerith Centre) is fully accessible to the ground floor, but has no lift access to the first floor. The ancillary building (K2) is fully accessible to both ground and first floors."
5070,"No steps, level through out, wet rooms, gentle slope to paddock to see sheep, decking around cottages
Hoists
Bath lifter
Profiling bed
Accessible kitchen facilities
Floor hoist"
5071,"The area is open plan, step free, and easy to navigate. Signage is clear. The only thing that is difficult to navigate, as a VI person, is the slight incline up to the main auditorium. This is more of a surprise than a difficulty and once you know it's there it's easy to navigate. I was sat in the 2nd row from the front, and not in the accessible seating area. I did not have a free +1 'carer ticket' as I was told I could only get one of these if I was sat in the accessible seating area, which I chose not to do as I didn't want to take a valuable wheelchair space. "
5072,"The Pleasance Dome is fully accessible and full of helpful staff to help and guide you. There are a few halls in this venue for shows, I attended the Queens Hall. The ground semi circle in front of the stage area i dedicated to wheelchair users, those with mobility issues and their companions so their is plenty of room!"
5073,"No dedicated parking for the disabled & limited parking adjacent to the restaurant. There is street parking, although the area does get busy. "
5074,On street parking right outside the door. Loads of buses stop nearby on Leith Walk.
5075,Separate disabled toilet without baby changing. Disabled toilet has bars in all the right places. Always clean and well maintained though. Still used by parents with kids despite the lack of baby changing.
5076,"The staff were pleasant , friendly and proffesional. One of the staff gave his captains hat to my brother to try it on and it really suited him.
 "
5077,"Full marks to all the staff for being helpful and friendly - except those who maintain the accessible toilets, who should know better than to 

- tie up the red emergency cord in the basement's accessible toilet
- maintain a red emergency cord which is too short in the 3rd floor accessible toilet
- block the wheelchair transfer space in the basement accessible toilet  with a big bin
- discriminate against disabled people by keeping the 3rd floor accessible toilet locked

"
5078,"I went in to this one blind as there was no information online about the access here. To my knowledge there is no parking, very easy building to access however, accessible toilets using radar key. Not an ideal venue for people with physical disabilities,  it is probably my least favourite venue for a gig so far but I still enjoyed it! "
5079,A tight door with a couple of bumps thet required help to give the wheelchair access
5080,"Please call for details. Access seemed to be from pavement to floor with either no or minimal step. I was with a young man with learning as opposed to physical difficulties, but was very impressed with the attitude of the staff and I have no doubt they'd be wiling to assist."
5081,"Popped in for a coffee and a relax. The cafe is wheelchair friendly with large open spaces between the tables. Though the counter is high, so to order you would have to go to the open space where the barristers come in and out. I am on two crutches so didn't have any problems. The service was very good and the barrista bought my coffee and cake to my table and then went and got sugar.

The toilets unfortunately were another matter. They are all user and have the baby change in them.
The cord was hooked up and had also been snapped near the top so some helpful person had turned it round and tied it up by the bottom handle. There was also bins in the transfer area.

I spoke to the duty manager and she could see exactly what the problems were and promised to sort the bins straight away and said she’d get the cord sorted.

The toilet wasn’t the cleanest but not filthy either. The flush was on the transfer side ( though only transfer from one side.) I carded the cord and explained the thoughts behind it. I’ll pop in again in a week or so and see if things have been sorted.

ETA: POPPED IN AND THE CORD HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH A SHINY NEW ONE AND WAS HANGING FREELY. THE TRANSFER AREA WAS CLEAR OF BINS. A BIG WELL DONE TO THE STAFF AT NERO'S."
5082,"As mentioned above, staff were helpful and offered to remove the changing table but it was fine. Easy to get in and out, very clean and tidy. There was a red cord next to the toilet hanging to the floor, everything was easy to access. There were grab rails. "
5083,"Summerhall, the former Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh now a creative hub for the arts with studio and workshop spaces. During the Edinburgh Festival Summerhall is Fringe Venue 26.

We attended a concert in the Red Lecture theatre as part of the Euan's Guide Review team.

The venue is well signposted, with a ramped route than avoids the steps to the main entrance. The reception desk is cluttered, with a lowered counter at the back to enable w/c access.

The building and courtyard bar area are complex, with some internal steps that can be bypassed by ramps."
5084,"The staff were all lovely, just not very good at following up when a request was made (i.e. are you looking for a wheelchair? Have you found a wheelchair? What have you done with my suitcase?). One member of staff was particularly keen to assist me by manipulating my limbs even when I'd told him I could manage. To be fair, he was just trying to help and it may have been a language barrier problem!"
5085,"I did not use any parking facility as I went by train. There are plenty of buses in the town, a good taxi service but only a 20 minute walk from the station. "
5086,"The signage is clear and large but no braille or tactile alternatives. The route markers are hard to see though.
There are picnic tables that have a place for a wheelchair and plenty of benches around the route.
The start of the so called accessable route is a loose grave path up so my Wheelchair kept slipping. It is a bit steep. No muddy areas of the path I can remember just rather steep with lots of rocks in the path."
5087,"wheelchair Access  as in getting around the whole place is good - actually being allowed on a fun ride, there is one ride called the AERO NOMAD, also two train rides ORIENT EXPEDITION and the HILL TRAIN (which are modes of transport instead of walking rather than a fun ride and a digger challenge (not a ride)"
5088,"Pretty good, on the whole"
5089,"One small lift from car park into venue, so takes a while waiting to get in. Staff on door were lovely, and insisted we jump the queue!

We sat in a bay at top of the tier, was a bit hard to find but great view and plenty of room."
5090,Only 1 space
5091,Fully accessible 
5092,Disables Parking available very close to the entrance 
5093,"I visited Caffè Nero late on a Thursday afternoon and so it was pretty busy with late-night shoppers; almost all the tables were full but there was still lots of space for my wheelchair to manoeuvre.  There was also lots of room in front of the counter to order and the staff were really friendly and helpful, insisting upon carrying our tray over to a table for us.  
The windows were at an ideal height for me to look out onto the street and people watch, also, the acoustics were great.  I often find it a problem to be heard in coffee shops as I wear a ventilation mask so it was fantastic to be able to enjoy the chilled-out atmosphere while also being able to chat without too much effort.  The apple juice I had was delicious and my P.A. told me that his coffee was really nice too."
5094,Very friendly staff willing to help.
5095,"If I could rate the staff an 11 here I would.
From the Admin to the receptionist to the shops to the staff in the museum, I have yet to encounter a single person who didn't do their best to make this an accessible experience. They allowed me to top up my chair's charge, they gave my dog water, they helped but didn't ""overhelp"".  Staff have an amazing attitude, love their work, and want to make the day a good one. Couldn't fault staff at a stretch.  We've been here many times: it's always the same. People here love their work, and their customers."
5096,"Accessible   Toilet is reasonable with grab rails and  a  low sink,  however there is a lack  of  turning space depending on the size of your wheelchair?  It is sometimes difficult for me to close the toilet door 
probably due to the size of my wheelchair.
 The accessible toilet can be accessed by the use of a radar key. (If   You don't have one? The restaurant has one on hand 

I forgot to say earlier that  there is another door to negotiate your way through before you reach the   Accessible toilet, the degree of the  difficulty for me is minimal but may vary for other wheelchair users? But again the staff are more than happy to help   Opening doors   Etc"
5097,"Signage is poor. Two room hearing loops. Only one was working. No portable loops.  2 rooms have permanently installed room hearing loops. They were in the main hall and the lounge.
In both rooms there were 7 neck loops, 1 stethosets, 1 microphone and 1 tie clip microphone. This was with the exception of the main hall which didn’t have a tie clip microphone. 
There were also 10 rechargeable batteries in each room. Unfortunately, each of the adapters holding these were turned off and not charging the batteries and therefore making the stethoset and neck loops unusable.
There were also no disposable ear protectors for the stethoset which would also have made them unusable. 
There weren’t any batteries for the microphone or tie clip microphones in the lounge. However there were working batteries in the main hall and the microphone and the tie clip microphone both worked well.

The coverage was good throughout the whole of the main hall

All of the equipment is brand new and it is a shame that they aren’t usable due to the lack of available batteries/ charging.
The signage was excellent on the doors to both rooms as you entered the room. We advised that there should be more signage up in each room and that it would preferably be blue as it’s more recognisable.

We established that when people make a booking that there is an option to request that they would like to have access to a hearing loop.

Rosemarie expressed concerns that she hadn’t been able to access the equipment when she had previously visited the venue. He said that there was now always someone on site so equipment should be accessible in the future"
5098,"There is a bus stop outside where the Ilkeston Flyer stops coming from Derby & towards Ilkston. There is no crossing and the dropped kerb is quite a walk away so crossing the road to other side is a challenge. The other side of road is quite steep so you'll need to be okay with a gradient. To get the bus towards Derby I recommend going right and not left. The left bus stop there isn't much space for a bus to deploy the ramp. There is quite a walk though. 

There are no accessible parking bays. "
5099,"There are a few disabled parking spaces outside tropical world, but also more parking on Park Lane and three other car parks. There are regular buses from and into town with regular bus stops.
There is also a small train that goes around the park that you can use if you don't fancy walking the whole way around . "
5100,Double Door ramped access - venue on the ground floor
5101,"It's right bang on the villages Main Street, albeit its on a steep hill. The car park at the bottom of the hill is big and has three accessible spaces. It is a 2 minute walk down from Hillsborough Castle. "
5102,Outdoor clothing store. Very helpful and friendly staff and plenty of room to get around most of the store even with our large wheelchair. Flat floor throughout.
5103,"I didnt find any accessible toilets. On the ground floor there are regular toilets. 

In my room although there was no toilet grab rail I was able to easily use the vanity unit to help me up.
"
5104,"Halfway between Cardross and Helensburgh, Ardardan is a Farm Shop, small gardening centre and tea room.
Everyone is made to feel welcome!"
5105,Staff and owner Brian are all very friendly and helpful.
5106,All the Disabled toilets were spacious fully appointed and could be accessed with a Radar Key. There was more than enough room for any sized wheelchair or power scooter and carer. There were numerous disabled toilets.
5107,On second floor of Buchanan galleries. There are two lifts to get up there. Open plan food court style. Lots of seating available. 
5108,"There were tables blocking parts of the ground floor making it difficult for me to get around myself, but the corridors were wide enough to allow me to pass people."
5109,"The staff were good in terms of serving  and listened very patiently to the requests of our children, but they took us to a table on the upper level without asking-I felt they could have made it easier for us by seating us on the lower level.  I also noticed another diner with a crutch sat near us too so maybe some disability awareness training could be helpful."
5110,"Door is wide but manual. It was quite a heavy door. There was no doorbell to ring for assistance.

I could fit under the table in my wheelchair. The table had a centre post with a large flat circular base. 

There was a lift downstairs however there is very little space to get out of the lift due to things being stored around the lift door. "
5111,Lovely and will do all they can to help.
5112,As a student at Napier I use this library often and am comfortable in the space. Staff are very helpful and plenty of facilities available.
5113,Excellent staff with great customer service.
5114,Small venue but lots of space in 'front of shop'.
5115,Staff were very helpful. Happy to fetch items we couldn't see or find.
5116,"Marlow Rowing Club is well equipped for both able bodied and disabled visitors. As a rowing club Marlow provides everything from learn to row courses through to championship squads. The building has a fabulous club room which is available to hire for functions with stunning views of the Thames, the picturesque bridge at Marlow and All Saint's Church. "
5117,"At the Water of Leith Visitor Centre. Down a corridor. The person on duty was very helpful indeed - opening doors for us and showing us where the accessible toilet is. The accessible toilet is on the small side, but manageable."
5118,"lovely, many offers of help as we went along. Very welcoming "
5119,"Some parking in the street, 3 minutes to both train and bus station. "
5120,All right for those who can walk a little but not for those who are confined to a wheelchair.
5121,Parking outside on the street but no disabled parking at the actual venue that I was aware of but there is a lowered kerb and it was easy to park.  There is also a car park nearby.
5122,"I travelled on public transport. The hotel is next to Edinburgh Park train station. Immediately behind the station is Edinburgh Park tram stop and next to that a bus stop going into the city centre.  The entire area is step free and there are 2 lifts to cross over the railway line. I felt the area was very safe, even at night, as I got off the train or tram and I was in the hotel 2 minutes later and there were always other people about, but it wasn't ever crowded.

There are direct trains to Haymarket and Edinburgh Waverley, the main train station,which only takes about 10 minutes. The tram make more stops and also goes to the Airport. There are a few buses that serve the area too.

The location is excellent. I would very happily stay here again.
"
5123,No steps. Two lifts.
5124,Automatic door entry and wide aisles.  When busy it can be a little more difficult to manoeuvre if people don't pull their chairs right in. Couldn't see signs for the toilets.
5125,"I can't score it highly as it was difficult to get a chair in.  There's a small step into the garden - bit of a bump up in my chair. The threshold step is smaller but uneven so care needed if on foot. The door opens inward and is a bit awkward. Once inside, floor is smooth. Biggest issue is stools everywhere and tight corners.  However it's perfectly possible with a wheelchair and staff were quick to help.  We were lucky possibly it wasn't terribly busy when we visited."
5126,"The Gulbenkian contains a fine theatre, a cinema and a concert hall, all on one level with fine bar/restaurant, but there are some aspects they could improve. Wheelchairs have to sit right in the very front of both theatre and cinema. There has been talk of making it possible to sit at the back by using an existing lift but a doorway needs to be opened up and that does not seem to be happening. In addition the venue is not generous with the discounts it offers. Disabled customers pay the same rate as pensioners but there is no discount to a carer, often a free ticket is provided, and the CEA cinema card is not acknowledged. Why is this?"
5127,"There is an easy to find accessible toilet, was in good condition. "
5128,Manager helpful but staff member seemed unaware
5129,Getting to the Botanic Gardens was for us more by accident than any effort of planning! We had walked along the riverside walkway from the town centre. The nearby road seemed quite busy and there were signs of buses going along. For the motorists there was plenty of parking in the area.
5130,"I visited this cafe for the first time today on Disabled Access Day and it was a fantastic experience; it was very accessible, very welcoming and it had a lovely atmosphere!  The staff were really friendly and offered to help although we didn't need any assistance as the access was so good.  The coffee and pastries were also really good as was the orange juice which was very zesty and zingy!"
5131,Lovely ‘makers’ gallery full of ever changing displays of beautiful crafts created by local crafts men and women  from blacksmiths to potters to silk workers. Cafe if also accessible and there’s an accessible toilet ( no changing places)
5132,"The Opera House which dates back to the 1880s, is ornate and opulent. I went to attend a ballet performance."
5133,There are toilets in store however they were out of order when I was there.
5134,There is an accessible loo but it was tucked away in a corner by the main entrance. It might not be too easy to find for some folk. It is a good size and easy to get in.
5135,"Lovely people, there when you wanted but otherwise unobtrusive."
5136,"My children have hidden disabilities, and issues relating to stress of new environments. Our visit was during the halloween themed special event. I contacted a member of staff before our visit for information, and she was extremely helpful.
She gave detailed descriptions of all staff costumes, themed decorations, and sound effects etc. I received a recommended itinerary for planning our visit so that we viewed the animals etc at their least busy times making it easier for us to help the children, and deal with medical needs without being in the middle of a crowd"
5137,out of the whole centre there is one lift inside; a lot of shops are outside and uphill so that is extremely hard for those who are disabled. there are many steps and literally no ramps which is a shame because Dumfries is such a nice place/
5138,I was greeted by a customer services guy when I entered and he offered to help.
5139,All helpful and friendly
5140,Level access on entire ground floor.
5141,"A clean, unfussy and more than adequate hotel with everything you need! The staff were really friendly and extremely helpful and the food and drinks were reasonably priced. 10/15 minutes walk into Bath town centre makes a really good choice."
5142,"There are designated disabled parking spaces situated directly outside the building.  Next to the parking is a trolley bay which is accessible by wheelchair and provides wheelchair trolleys that attach for convenience.
There is a bus stop outside the building on the Leeds Road, a regular service (No 36 stops here), there is a pedestrian access from the bus stop leading to the building, this is also wide enough for wheelchairs to access."
5143,"Very eager to make sure that we have a nice stay and striving to improve the already excellent accommodations, I'm certain that as time goes by the Flat Spaces will only get better."
5144,The staff members are the most wonderful people the boys had the honour to meet
5145,"Writing this review as somebody who travelled to Aberdeen from Edinburgh on the train, with a mobility impairment and a speech impediment.

We got the train from Haymarket (Edinburgh) to Aberdeen railway station, getting the train at 15.30 and coming into Aberdeen at 17.50. The boat left at 19.00 so we were giving ourselves a little bit of leeway. The ferry terminal is literally a 10-minute walk away (best route is taking the station exit into Union Street Shopping Centre, and walking through to the back of the centre) and head to straight to the boat-shaped object at the port. Joking aside, it’s a bit of a worry however when you don’t know where you’re going and you think the boat will go without you, but I assure you that it’s very close and taxis are situated right outside the train station – you can get a taxi right to the door of the ferry terminal.

When we reached the terminal, it was very calm and the people who checked us in where very cheerful, informative and communicated clearly and respectfully. Here you check-in, receive your boarding passes and they will answer any questions that you may have.

The terminal itself has a as lift up to the deck and a ramp that leads you onto the ferry. When you enter you are on the deck where the cabins are.  Here you will be met by people who check your tickets as well as telling you how to get to your cabin. Going over we did not stay in an accessible cabin but we were lucky enough to have a Premium Outer 2 berth.

The cabin was good. It had two single beds and one could be doubled up as a sofa. The room came with a TV with a selection of recently released films. I found the room to be very dark when the lights were out, and when you’re on a boat you may not want to be going around looking for a light switch, it might be an idea to identify the light switches a bit better when lights are off, or install a ‘night light’ to provide minimal lighting. The door to the shower had a lip and it was rather awkward to get into the bathroom – though I appreciate it was not an accessible room. I woke up at 3am and it was rather rough. We opened the blind and just saw the waves crashing against the boat and it was beautiful. All the accessible cabins are in the inner of the boat and I feel that is a shame. However the outer cabins are much louder, and we did both get a much better night’s sleep in the inner cabin.

The shop, restaurant, bars, sitting areas are up a deck, either accessed by stairs or lifts.   The whole upper deck is on one level and has wide aisles. The doorway outside deck has high lips on the bottom so it’s a bit tricky if you want to experience the outdoors. I can’t see how it would be possible for a wheelchair user.

The restaurant was pleasant place to have your dinner and breakfast, here a number of tables chairs and arm chairs are laid out. The staff were very helpful, chatty and respectful. The menu has vegetarian and gluten-free options. The Magnus’ Lounge is where I would recommend to eat, as it is a bit more spacious and there are tables with seats removed for wheelchair users. Depending on your ticket, it may cost a bit more to access, but for this you get free tea, coffee and biscuits at any time, newspapers and magazines, and a free continental breakfast.

On the first night, we were pretty tired so we had a meal, then went to the cabin, watched a movie and went to sleep.

In the morning, we woke when the ferry docked and went for breakfast, had a shower. It was very small and was a bit awkward for me, but this was not an accessible room. Though I would not think I would need an accessible room. Although the ferry arrives very early, breakfast is served until 09.00, so if you are travelling by car you can disembark, park nearby and go back to the ship for breakfast if you wish.

On the way back, it was more relaxing as we knew what to expect. We had a fantastic day in and around Lerwick but were quite tired so we headed back to the ferry at 18.30. The ferry terminal is only about a ten-minute walk from the centre of Lerwick – very close, and I you can catch a bus outside to the centre of the town. The terminal itself is accessible with step-free entrances, lifts and a good sized accessible toilet. It was not busy when we checked in and it felt very calm and organised and they answered questions we had with a smile.

The walk up to the ferry from the terminal is pretty much the same as on the Aberdeen side. With going up a lift to the about 100-meter ramped entrance to the deck where the cabins were, also met by some cabin crew who directed us to our cabin and to answer any questions."
5146,"Good level access from car park to room.
"
5147,"The shopping centre has good disabled access, with level access available throughout the different entrances. There are numerous lifts located throughout the centre to reach all levels."
5148,There were several toilets. We used the accessible toilet in the main block. It was RADAR locked and very clean. I was hoping to have a look at the changing places toilet but that is on a RADAR lock plus a number pad and we couldn't work out how to open it.
5149,All the staff were very helpful and knowledgeable. The role-play element of the main tour was particularly engaging.
5150,"As staying nearby didn;t go by car but there is a small car park on gravel which maybe hard for wheelchair users, few steps up to the entrance and bit of limited space inside. Concrete ramp to the entrance it is just at the door there was a bit of a step/lip."
5151,"Good access, well signed"
5152,Staff were attentive and helpful.
5153,Staff were helpful and welcoming.
5154,"great access all round for wheelchairs. plenty of room between tables, ample parking, friendly staff"
5155,Staff are helpful and  friendly
5156,"The best way to get here is by car, there are a number of disabled parking bays at the front of the complex.  No coaches allowed ."
5157,"Adapted disabled rooms at the far end of a long corridor with a number of fire doors. Receptionist accepted by complaint, but said it was a requirement of the fire authorities, because the disabled rooms would be next to the emergency exit."
5158,There is car park adjacent to the park which makes it easy to get to the park. Level paths /ramps throughout.
5159,"The visitor centre staff / volunteers were great, welcoming and pleased to be able to share the heritage and history of the the Fort and the village."
5160,Small. Red cord tied up. Once untied it was still a metre of the floor. Had to reverse out and one of the tables makes this quite tight. 
5161,"Wheelchair friendly, plenty of accessible toilets, helpful staff, not as busy earlier in day, lots to see."
5162,Transfer was via coach from the airport so this may be a problem. However several chair users arrived via wheelchair taxi from the airport which was only a 30min journey (approx. 20 euro)
5163,"The main access uses a couple of steps with handrails, but all flat wheelchair access is via the bar. I'm afraid I didn't look for any signs as our party already knew where we were going. 
I haven't used the upstairs function room, so I'm not aware of a lift is available"
5164,"There are adequate disabled access at the estate with ramps almost to all the sites. There are only a few stairs at the site. There is ramped access to the shop and automatic doors. The entrance to the tea room is level with clear open space. There is also a lift  that provides access to all floors for wheelchair users, however, electric wheelchairs are not allowed in the house and pushchairs cannot be pushed around the house.
Meanwhile all of the grounds, gardens and walled gardens are fully accessible. Push wheelchair users might struggle on some of the areas like the Home Farm and the Stables courtyard. Many trails and walks are accessible but steep in parts. 
Note that Electric wheelchairs must be left outside the tea rooms and Estate Office. 
A manual wheelchair is however available at the entrance of the house to borrow during visit. Unfortunately wheelchair users are not offered assistance around the house. The Estate Office can be contacted on (011)33367560 to book manual wheelchair and terrain mobility scooters to use outdoors. Entry to the Temple Newsam is free for carers."
5165,Really good. The main bit of the camp is housed in a wooden pavilion building where there are information panels and video exhibits. There are two ways to get here - one with steps where you complete a loop of the site and one that is step free but you do walk half way round then come back in yourself. There is a map to keep you right though. There is also the memorial itself which is also on the concrete path.
5166,Accessible for wheelchairs. 
5167,Clearly marked on map with good signage.  Large easy access. 
5168,"The new Foyles bookshop is a vast improvement on their horrible ancient premises next door. Overall impression: good, except for the 5th-floor café and the difficulty of getting around the shop with a wheelchair. On my most recent visit the accessible toilet was in a bad state too. "
5169,"On first contact and appearances, it seems to be an accessible venue, however in practice I found it wasn't the case. It was one of my worst experiences in recent years."
5170,"The accessible toilet was near the checkouts and had a wide easy to manage door, grab rails, and plenty of space. It was clean and tidy. Dropped a point as the door was obstructed by abandoned shopping trolleys."
5171,A tale of two half! Access at Murrayfield is good apart from the one tiny lift!! Staff are helpful - both security staff and Murrayfield staff themselves. We were lucky enough to be in a box for the match and had a great view and a great afternoon.
5172,All lovely - lady at the cafe carried my tray to a table for me
5173,There are 6 public blue badge slots just outside the main entrance to the art gallery. Nothing on their website mentions these.
5174,Everywhere we went people were helpful and friendly
5175,Clearly marked accessible loo but access via 2 doors needed assistance and reverse exit.
5176,"There was a wooden ramp from the parking bay up to the private patio area. The patio had table and chairs, gas BBQ, patio heater and small outdoor fridge, but there was still space to easily move around in my wheelchair.

Access from the patio into the tent was level and step-free. Once inside I was shocked by how spacious it was. There was lots of space to manoeuvre around and it felt bigger than a lot of hotels I've stayed in. It also felt nice to drive across the smooth wooden floors. 

The king-size bed was comfortable and was nicely decorated with cushions, blanket and hot water bottles. The bed was lower than a standard bed, so it made wheelchair transfers fairly easy. Space underneath the bed could accommodate a portable hoist if needed.

As there was no electricity in the tent, there were times we struggled especially in the bathroom at night. The small solar light on the roof didn't give off much light so we were almost in complete darkness. This made using the bathroom even with assistance very difficult and a little risky especially as I can't walk, have extremely poor upper body strength and rely on help with everything. I feel the low-key lighting is perhaps not so good for guests with mobility and visual impairments.

There are so many pros to there being no electricity. One being you get to switch off and have no distractions from the internet world, friends etc. However, this could be a problem for disabled guests who require mobility aids/medical equipment and also need to charge them. I have a powerchair so I'd need to charge it if I was there any longer than a day. Thankfully I live very close and fully charged my chair the night before our stay. "
5177,"I walked there from my accomodation, however there are trams that stop near by."
5178,There is a public loo available. It had bins in interesting places but other than that was fairly spacious and clean.
5179,"The town centre of Ars en Re is flat, most of the roads are not very busy with traffic. L' Eglise Sainte Etiene, the church with the distinctive spire is open all day and there are 2 entrances, one of which is step free. 
The tourist information is also on the main square but there were a short flight of stairs to the entrance. I was unaware of an alternative entrance.
The walk to the port is a 5 minute, level walk. Also close to where the bus stops is the beach, which I did not go to as the lady at the tourist information office said that there wasn't a promenade to walk along just beach.
There were a few restaurants on the main square. I went to the Patisserie/ Salon de the which was step free and offered a self service restaurant with savoury food and fancy French cakes. There were indoor and outdoor seating and also food was available for take away."
5180,"Access in and around the building:

Arriving at the hotel from the station you see the front of the building with little prominent signage. Getting closer you’re likely to pass the door and then realise it is the hotel as it does have the look of an office block from the exterior.

There's an automated main entrance door as you arrive that is triggered by sensors as you approach. There is level access in most parts of the hotel. I found getting around, as a powerchair user, fairly easy with 
smooth floors in the principal areas such as the reception and dining areas.  

Two lifts (side by side) serve all floors. The lift door clearance is 88 cm. When moving between the reception area and the restaurant and bar you pass outside (under cover) and go in to the second building. There’s a ramp when you enter the second building that takes you down to the restaurant and bar level. 

Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:

The hotel has four accessible rooms. The bathrooms vary as one has a bath with a seat to move you into the bath and the others have a bath.

The entrance door to the accessible room was wide and had a clearance of 86 cm. There was plenty of space to wheel into and around the room; as well as approach the bed from one side.

The room was bright and well lit from the natural daylight streaming in the dual aspect windows.

Access in the dining area:

The dining room was at ground level and approached along a corridor with a ramp and some double doors. Once inside there was plenty of space and the tables and chair are moveable if required. 

Access to other facilities:

The bar is next to the restaurant and offers a range of tables and chairs. There was ample space to move around in my powerchair."
5181,"This shop is a great place for wheelchair users if you're not interested in jazz. All the jazz stuff is in the basement, which is not wheelchair-accessible. Everything else is on the ground floor, there's a ramp for getting into the shop, and there's even an accessible toilet. "
5182,"There  were staff about everywhere who were eager to assist and point you in the right direction, assistance which is needed to get to the 3, 4 and 5."
5183,"The staff were very friendly, helpful and patient and gave us a tour round "
5184,"Students from the Entry to Learning Level 2 course at Edinburgh College visited The Scottish Parliament as part of their Leonard Cheshire Can Do community review project. We had a Q&A session with Ben Macpherson MSP within the Scottish parliament and then had a tour around the building learning all about the architecture and artwork. We then got to observe a debate in the main hall.

Overall we gave this visit 5 out of 5 stars and would highly recommend it!"
5185,We like to identify mobility scooter accessible locations that have pleasant gardens and other facilities to stroll around. Pittencrieff Park ticks all these boxes nicely.
5186,"I don't drive, so I don't know what the parking is like - but from a quick search, the nearest blue badge spaces are in Nelson Street and Nun Street. There is also good access via the metro; monument is the nearest stop, less than one minute walk away. 

As I have a disabled bus pass, I went with my partner by bus. There is a direct bus that stops on the opposite side of the street directly opposite the cinema. "
5187,Always helpful when I need assistance. I've had a couple of PTs in here for various things and they've all been great. 
5188,Extremely helpful and friendly 
5189,Flat entrance with automatic disable doors
5190,"Lots of good public transport options given proximity to Lothian Road (loads of buses) and the tram stops at the bottom of Lothian Road. 
Parking is limited and best bet is to park on a single yellow line across the road if you have a blue badge. we parked on Grindlay Street. "
5191,"Great Pub with great staff, all customers are treated equally.  All access is wheelchair friendly.  Staff will go the extra mile.  Lots of room inside, all amenities are on ground level.  Lovely beer garden."
5192,"Helpful, friendly staff."
5193,Fine once you get there
5194,"Nice pub with friendly staff and relaxing atmosphere. Tasty food, big beer garden. Highly recommend!"
5195,"From Waverley Train Station we exited, crossed Market Street and the cafe was directly in front of us."
5196,"The disabled toilet is a good size and you need a Radar key for it, which prevents it from being abused and helps to keep it in a good state of cleanliness.  That though is the only good thing I can say about it.  It's location is not convenient for a wheelchair user, being that it is right at the back of the auditorium about eighty feet or so from the disabled area. Not so bad if you have a catheter but if you don't and you need to go, you are going to have to fight your way through eighty feet of wall to wall bodies. And you know what it's like, most able bodied folk can't see below chest height and are oblivious to wheelchairs......ooh, all those ankles and feet for the taking!"
5197,Level access and lifts throughout.
5198,"Clean and tidy. Good space to get in with carer, but not wide enough to turn round."
5199,Monte St Michel is totally inaccessible to disabled visitors
5200,There is a very good dual sided disabled accessible toilet with space for a carer. Separate toilets for children and baby changing area. Very clean 
5201,"If one could give more than 5, I would do so.  All the staff we dealt with were excellent and went out of there way to make our stay an enjoyable one"
5202,"I think there are possibly three disabled loos, definitely two. You just wait at the gate and the attendant lets you in free ( walking people have to pay haha). 
The loo cubicle is huge and the toilet a usual height with handrails both sides. I'm not great at transferring and it's fine. Door ok too - not quite as heavy as some.
It's probably worth adding also that the lighting in the toilets is really bright too - ideal for me as I catheter!.
"
5203,Staff are very lovely! They were helpful and friendly. 
5204,"Disabled ramp easy to find, but once accessed the hotel corridors very narrow and difficult to manoevere, but an old building. Several doors to negotiate , would have struggled on my own. Signage could be better, to restaurant and public areas.
Did not access rest of building although noticed a chairlift to upper floors
Public bar next to car park had flush access"
5205,The accessible loo is on the 1st floor and is accessed via a lift. It is quite tight inside but does have plenty of handrails.
5206,Parking at the front where the adjoining Chinese supermarket has a car park.  Usually room to park.
5207,"Greet location the pool has got all facilities for people with a disability like the hoist into the water they are really good, PS bright centre "
5208,Soft sand at start of the beach needed a bit more effort to push but rest of it totally fine. Wooden walkway to the sand was easy. Car park to bunker where the buggies are is tarmac
5209,"Staff and volunteers are very helpful, friendly. I'm one of the volunteers here (the 5 stars is not for me it's for my colleagues). "
5210,"There are plenty of parking spaces on nearby roads if you go early on a weekend. However, there is are no allocated accessible parking spaces in the ground and members of the MCC or Middlesex CC take precedence over disabled visitors. The parking you can book via Lords has no specific accessible spaces and is a bit of a trek away. It's also expensive at £26."
5211,The crew on board the ship consisted of the captain and permanent crew who taught and showed us the volunteer crew what to do. The crew were very good at teaching us the ropes and safety while we were at sea.
5212,"There is a generally well-laid-out accessible toilet at the back of the back bar, secured by a RADAR key lock. Mysteriously, the staff keep their RADAR key in the basement, not in the bar (why???!), so you may encounter a delay if you don't have your own RADAR key.

There are some bad features of this toilet.

- I found the red emergency cord tied up out of reach, this is very thoughtless, dangerous and silly. This cord must reach all the way to the floor so that it can be reached by anyone who falls over in the often perilous transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back.

- The RADAR lock was broken. It cannot be raised to the 'locked' position. This means that I was unable to lock myself into the toilet, so that anyone else with a RADAR key would have been able to gain entry while I was in the middle of doing my business, with my trousers down. This is TOTALLY NOT-OK! The RADAR lock needs to be replaced with one that works correctly.

- The hand-dryer was much too high on the wall for a wheelchair user to reach. It's incomprehensible that anyone could have decided to install it at that height in a toilet specifically designed and intended for wheelchair users.

See my pictures below.

I spoke to a deputy manager in January 2019 about these problems, she listened sympathetically and was sweetness itself, but by September 2019 these problems have not been fixed, which is very disappointing. "
5213,There is 1 bay for blue badge parking outside the venue and 2 small car parks near by. There are good public transport links though.
5214,There is plenty of parking at The Fort and bus links.
5215,"Doorway into cafe are wide and gangway to queue provides lots of space to manouver a wheelchair or other mobility aid. 
Counter is lowered to allow better access to the pin machine. 
Loud music was playing throughout visit. 
My drink was served with a paper straw. No information on materials were available. 
Moving into the seating area poses a greater issue. There are are large amount of tables and the walkways are not wide enough. "
5216,"We walked here so it's difficult to say - Bold Street was incredibly busy so parking didn't look easy, but there was on-street parking directly in front of the bakehosue. Unfortunately I don't know the area too well to offer alternatives, but given it's in the city centre I'd imagine there is more parking nearby. It is close to a main road with bus stops, and we managed to get a taxi from there."
5217,"Only tried the one at Totnes. Very difficult to use due to a sloped entry, door that only half opens and small space. Not really wheelchair accessible. Buckfastleigh may have better facilities."
5218,The toilet was not accessible.
5219,"Nasty lip at front door made getting in tricky. Carpeted inside.  All level. Reasonable circulation space for wheelchair.  Route to loo was twisty turny, had awkward door (turn in corridor, inward opening, complicated locking mechanism) to negotiate, via very uneven external path."
5220,"Both the Kerith Centre & K2 have disabled toilets, with the Kerith Centre having changing facilities - not sure about K2"
5221,"There is a lovely outside courtyard which over looks the sea front, with free standing tables and chairs. There are three deep steps up to the counter. There is a hand rail in the middle but in the photo it is obscured by the large pot plant. I walk with a crutch and I felt the steps were too big for me to access comfortably/ safely. "
5222,"The owners, Iain and Margaret, could not have been more helpful and were keen to get feedback to make further improvements."
5223,"A friend and I, both disabled, stayed at this hotel for four nights. She suggested booking it because she knew that PAs get complimentary rooms. Although we found it difficult to initially book, once we did, we arrived to find the service excellent."
5224,Blue badge spaces. I went by car and suspect there aren't public transport options 
5225,"The Hotel did not have steps and to our understand  it was all based on one single floor. There is a lot of seating available in the main lounge area which is very spacious. There was a stage that was visible from nearly every table in the lounge area. The corridors to the rooms were wide and had plenty of space for larger wheelchairs to navigate with ease. In the rooms there are no braille texts or other alternative formats however the staff are more than happy to assist any person in finding out any information. The bedrooms were simplistic but lovely, ideal for easy access around the room."
5226,Never disappoints. Only loses a point for the heavy door to the loos.
5227,Spent a great couple of hours around the Loch. Didnt get to see any beavers as it was mid afternoon as apparantly they usually come out early morning and evening.
5228,"Great access all on the level, with Lifts down to the platfoms the only thing is the lifts can be a bit small"
5229,"A lot has been done to improve access. There are powered doors for wheelchairs at the front, lifts and loos."
5230,"Everyone very friendly, nearby if required but not intrusive.  Ask if you need anything and they will help."
5231,Disabled parking is immediately on entry off main road. Mainline train station half a mile from the venue
5232,"The entrance is step-free and it's possible to get to all areas of the ground floor. Some stock is too high to see or reach, but staff will help with that. All vinyl records are in the basement, which is reachable only via a staircase."
5233,"They have regular toilets and accessible toilets throughout the Eden Project and also have a Changing Places toilet with a hoist and bench. Plenty of room for carers. The space enabled me to easily use the hoist to transfer my son from his large powered wheelchair, to the bench, then toilet and back again. "
5234,Historic Building in Paisley wheelchair access through side entrance
5235,"I got off the bus 30/40 yards away. Because there is no drop kerb on either side of the road you have to cross, you have to turn left travel 30 yards, cross the road and then 30 yards back again. This is obviously not the premises's fault but Glasgow City councils.
There is plenty of on street parking but because it's a residential area, it can get quite busy.
"
5236,"For such a modern attraction I was disappointed to find such a tiny accessible toilet once you are through security. It is very narrow and the same size as the other toilets. The sink was also tiny and the flushes are located behind the toilet which could be quite hard to reach. It is also worth mentioning that there aren't any toilets once you are in the viewing pod.
The toilet near the entrance is bigger and I'd recommend going here before you go through security, although the design of this toilet is still not great. The flush is on the wrong side, the red emergency cord is tied up out of reach and there were bins in the transfer area."
5237,"Nervous of visiting old houses, it transpired that Abbotsford is one of the few that have created an accessible experience throughout the house. The welcome we received was great and the information available before we visited made it possible for us to decide to visit with confidence. "
5238,But they always smell unpleasant and are too hot.
5239,"Access in and around the building:

The main entrance has a traditional revolving door. Alongside is a small ramp built into the entrance and a wide access door. It was easy to get through and a concierge was quickly on hand to hold the door.

Once in the building the reception is in front of you. There were plenty of staff on hand.

The building is on several floors. One of many lifts leads from reception to the upper floors. My powerchair is quite large at 68 cm wide and 116 cm in length so I used the service lift – not that I knew it was a service lift until later.

The wide corridors to the accessible bedrooms were amazing. Once had enough space for a seating area and a piano! Apparently this stems for from the days of ladies in the grand ball gowns not wishing to touch another lady’s gown as they swept along the corridor to the grand staircase.

Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:

The accessible bedroom was a surprise in that the door opened to reveal so much space. The room door had a clearance of 86 cm so plenty of room to wheel in.

There were no tight corners and tricky turns to be done here! With access to both sides of the beds and a large seating area it was great.

The accessible wet room was spacious and had a door the same size as the room door; again no tight turns. With an integral shower and plenty of space around the toilet it worked well for me.

The two accessible rooms are identical. 

Access in the dining area:

The hotel offers several items for dining or getting light refreshments. Peacock Alley offers a lounge style area where you can relax and admire the old station architecture or just watch the gentle movement of the station clock as time ticks away.

The adjacent Brassiere provides breakfast and other dining options during the day. The hotel’s Pompadour restaurant offers fine dining and great views. I visited all three during my visit and they were all easy to get in and move around. Furniture could be moved to make access easier and the staff were magnificent.

Access to other facilities:

The hotel does have a spa and swimming pool. I ventured down to visit these and whilst not going as far as swimming I can confirm that there is an accessible changing room!"
5240,"This place has great food but the step at the front door may pose a problem for you. I had a portable ramp with me at the time so it wasn't a problem, but if you don't have a portable ramp it might be.

"
5241,"Loos were great - no complaints there.  Clean, paper present, good lighting."
5242,"Café serving breakfasts, lunches and afternoon teas to die for. As well as indoor seating there is a patio which overlooks Babbacombe Downs and the sea."
5243,"Access in and around the building,

Wheeling along from the station I found the hotel quite easily. The entrance is a modern glass fronted facing. There are plenty of signs showing the hotel name and a large rotary style door spins to admit guests. I used the accessible door to the side of this which was extra wide for wheelchair access.

Getting in from the street was level access and you wheel straight in to the reception area. At this point you are actually on the fourth floor. 

The reception was bright and modern and is on the left hand side as you enter the foyer area.  The reception has an induction loop and this is clearly signposted.  Just around the corner from reception was a large lift to take you to the other floors. The lift has a door clearance of 92 cm.
 



Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms,

During my visit I saw two of the thirteen accessible bedrooms. All the accessible rooms have wet rooms which was great news. The doors to the rooms were wide and gave a clear space of 83 cm to get in.

Some of the accessible rooms are doubles and others set up as twin rooms. There was plenty of space to wheel around and some of the furniture could be moved which was helpful.

Bright spacious wet rooms provide shower, hand basin and toilet facilities. The shower space was generous and there were plenty of grab rails around each of the areas.

Importantly, I was easily able to wheel along the side of the bed in order to transfer.

Access in the dining area,

The dining area, lounge and bar are on a lower floor. Taking the loft down it was easy to find and to wheel in. There was plenty of room to move around. Tables and chairs were moveable which made getting a comfortable position was easy.

Access to other facilities,

The bar was integral to the dining area and offered a range of seating."
5244,"Toilets are accessible in all areas of the hotel, however a number of the doors are very heavy and a number of people could struggle with this when trying to gain access."
5245,"The staff are extremely friendly & cheerful, & are happy to accommodate special orders."
5246,There are 3 dedicated disabled bays at the entrance.
5247,"Best effort has been made to a very old building, toilet is accessible in a wet room with shower, fixed and fold down rails. A little tatty and possibly not suitable for a large power chair to maneuver, transfers may be difficult to users who are not especially mobile. I had no difficulty but am a wheelchair using above knee amputee."
5248,"Todays Spa’s are becoming more and more popular, and this Spa is highly 
recommended by us, it has everything you need, and just looking at our photos will show you what we mean, but there is a lot more to this Spa than we can show you today. 
The park has one of the top best Spa’s, which features 8 pools, with soft gentle relaxing music played to coax that feeling of well being, and as you look around at 
what is available you will see that this is truly a first class Spa. For a start off it has two inviting swimming pools, the heated indoor pool is for adults only, with loungers and beach chairs to help you relax in its quiet pleasant surroundings, while the outdoor Heated pool invites all ages to come and enjoy the facilities, which includes a pool bar.  You can also enjoy a spa bath, thermal cabins, award winning treatment rooms, and a modern fitness centre. It is just quite a wonderful experience to see what is available for you, and you will find that they will help and support you all the way, they are encouraging disabled to come and enjoy their facilities, and we really do recommend this as a Spa that all should go and enjoy, words will never be enough praise for Pennyhill Park.

To really see what we mean, then do go to their website where more details and photos can be seen.

OUR REVIEW OF THE SPA AND HEALTH CLUB.
The Spa and club has been seperately built away from the main hotel, in a truly delightful setting, and for the disabled we will just point out that if it’s a manual chair you use, then you will need the help of your carer, as it’s uphill on your return to the car park or hotel itself, but don’t miss the chance to see what can be done by people who care for others.

Alongside the main hotel car park by the main entrance, an intriguing village like setting invites you to come and see what it’s all about (photo 1) and the archway calls you on to explore what lies ahead (photo 2). There is a downhill slope ahead (3) that may call for your brakes to be applied to save your chair running away with you, and this will help your carer anyway.
 (It would be wonderful if management could ever consider laying down a disabled bay down by the Spa entrance via the path, so that disabled could drive down and thus enjoy this magnificent Health club.) 
The entrance to the Spa has a number of steps that may concern you (4) but there is a wide path available that runs over to the left (5) and this will take you along to a pull handle door to get you inside the Spa (6).
The passage ahead is very nicely decorated in subdued colours and furnishings. (photo 7) that guides you to the reception desk (8) and the very friendly staff who await to guide and support you. Just explain that you have been encouraged to come and see what is available here, and ask if you may be shown their facilities. It’s all on the level on the ground floor, with plenty of seating (9) with inviting views across to the outdoor pool and back towards the main hotel. You will see a lift awaiting to take you down to the lower level (10) and to the most magnificent heated pool that beautifully lies in marbled stoned flooring, (photo 11) with a bubbling jacuzzi that calls you forward (12). The showers alone are wonderfully tiled (13) and the heated tiled loungers are waiting (14) but I don’t  think my husband will manage them, if he 
got down I doubt if he will get up again, so let’s move on before he is daft enough to try.
A sauna looks more inviting, and oh my, was it hot in there (photo 15) and what impressed him was the amount of different steam rooms that are available (photos 16 and 17) after which you step out and drop into the plunge pool, and that is cold believe me (18) then a quick wash down (19) before stepping outside to the heated swimming pool, with delightful cane furniture to slip into while enjoying your surroundings (20).
He took many, many other photos of this magnificent Spa and health club, but can only show you so much, so please go into their website to see more of what a Club should be like.

OUR FINAL THOUGHTS.
Absolutely divine, this really touches the heart, but as you have thought, expensive, but surely you feel as we do, you get what you pay for. The whole experience of being kindly shown around their facilities by a very helpful, enthusiastic young lady, 
was a pleasure, and a place never to be forgotten. 
If you live in the area around Ascot and Windsor, or visiting the hotel on a day out or perhaps staying overnight, then do try this wonderful Health club, it’s a memory you will treasure."
5249,"I contacted The Beatles Story in advance of my visit, to let them know when I plan to go, and also for my own peace of mind. The only thing they asked is that you call them on the day to check that their outdoor lift is working. On the day I visited, the lift was working and everything went smoothly. The tour takes you from the beginning to the end of The Beatles, the sets, outfits and the stories of each member after the band separated. You wear a headset and receive a little box attached to it that as your tour guide, each set has its own number corresponding to the audio.
I thoroughly enjoyed the tour, it was imaginative and a fantastic way to lay out the story."
5250,"There are various disabled accessible toilets within the park, however there is not one at the car park meaning that you have to walk into the park first to find this. They are all level access and large, with wide doors making it easy for a wheelchair user and carer(s) to be present. In the Safari Cafe toilet, I noticed a hoist, which is ideal if this is required. However, there is not a hoist present in every toilet facility. The toilets themselves are high, which is beneficial for anybody transferring from a wheelchair to the toilet with assistance. "
5251,"The staff are very friendly , chatty and helpful. "
5252,"We travelled by car, 2 dedicated accessible spaces near the entrance , plenty of parking
The museum is on the main Dumfries/Annan to Carlisle bus route, with a regular service passing the museum "
5253,"There are a couple of entrances for a step free route I would follow the signposts and approach by the road leading to the car park. This is on a slight upward hill and passes the bowling club and tennis courts. This brings you directly to the house. From the car park area there is level access to some of the gardens, with flower beds. There are steps without a handrail leading to an upper terrace. 
For a step free route return to the car park. To the right of the house is the Rotunda, between the two buildings is a wall with an arch way (see my photo). Go through the archway and follow the path upwards and round to the left and this will bring you to the side of the other side of the house and the upper terrace.
When I arrived I used the grotto garden entrance, next to the petrol  station on the main road. I immediately had a flight of stairs to climb. The grotto area is nice with a lake. I'm not sure if there is a step free way to the grotto as while I walked around I came to a number of stairs and steps, often without hand rails.
The garden contains many sub-tropical plants and shrubs. In the area surrounding the house there are plenty of benches."
5254,"As you arrive towards the house you natuarally follow signs straight ahead for reception, which takes you into a reasonably big car park, but there are no disabled bays here.
If we had known, we would have turned left at a junction in the grounds itself, marked for Spa, and that would have given us a far easier entry into the hotel.
For the reason we did not know about this entrance, we have dropped marks to 3.5 overall. This left turn for the Spa is reviewed in PART TWO of ALBRIGHTON HALL."
5255,"Radar key operated accessible loo, though it wasn't locked when I visited. Very well equipped and clean. Well done, Yorkshire Water."
5256,I'm a regular visitor to Wellcome. My last review was July 2021. This is an update from today's visit. Please see my earlier reviews for photos and more details.
5257,Staff all aware of loop requirements on counters.
5258,Two designated Blue Badge spaces in the car park. Did not use public transport so cannot comment.
5259,"Toilet accessibility  is poor as toilets are situated up two flights of stairs, a hand rail is provided. There is no lift access available. Also there are no disabled specific toilets."
5260,Staff were lovely. Very friendly and welcoming but they couldn't fix the issues that made the facility inaccessible to us. 
5261,Parking was easy as there are disabled bays immediately outside of the store. If arriving by bus it is a significant distance from the store to the bus stop and requires you to go up a fairly lengthy ramp or take the long route around via the access road.
5262,The staff were amazing! Nothing was as issue for them and they were very keen to help.
5263,Easy access lifts and G4S holds the doors open for you 
5264,"Clean country park with varied terrain. All tracks are suitable for scooter/wheelchair if not a little bumpy at times. 

There are some gates which might be tricky if you are out and about on your own. 

Overall a lovely space with a great view of Pitsford Water. "
5265,My wife has been a wheelchair user for 16 years and we visited Kelham Island for their special open day. We were able to easily visit all of the exhibits and attractions and there has been dramatic improvement for wheelchair users since our first visit about 4 years ago. I was particularly impressed with the smooth wheelchair walkway which had been created to overcome the cobbled access areas.. Toilet facilities were fine and automatic doors were available. A great deal of thought and work has gone into making this museum accessible for all.
5266,Cannes on the French Riviera is a town best known for annual film festival and luxury shops and hotels. This is a general review of the town.
5267,Was able to easily hire an mobility scooter and it was quite easy to get around the shop. 
5268,"Lovely Chinese on the waterfront at burton water, good level access and ramped upper area, lighting a bit subdued for those with vision imparements"
5269,"I stayed in this hotel on my recent trip to the Naidex disability show.  We chose it as it was the closest one to the NEC with just a 5min walk between the two (5mins from door to door maybe, we were in hall 6 which was another 10min walk inside).  It was a little pricier than I would normally want but not having to negotiate Birmingham roads at rush hour each day was a massive positive.  

Two electric doors welcomed you into the reception area where the receptionist (he was nice enough) ushered me round to the lowered counter.  Thought the checkin process he was very attentive and spoke to me (not my dad) the whole time without being awkward.

Our twin room was on the ground floor, however it was through three doors and none of them were electric.  Dad tried to pin them open as they had magnets on them but they didn't work.  A bit of an inconvenience as it meant I couldn't get to the room unaided. 

I had asked for an accessible room, it was a quirky L shaped design which worked for me as I can walk a little, but if you needed to transfer from your wheelchair to the bed it could be a little tight. Not the best bed I've ever slept in, it was more like a rock, the pillow was weirdly hard as well. i definitely didn't sleep well.  The ensuite wet room was really nice and spacious.  Loads of handrails but missing a shower curtain so water literally went everywhere . The shower was nicely powerful, though missing a wee shelf to put all your stuff on.

In the bar/restaurant there was loads of space.  One of the exhibitors was staying so at one point there was 5 wheelchairs in the restaurant without any problem."
5270,Cleaned daily shower ensuites and larger accessible bathrooms all with access to mobile hoists. Also plenty of extra toilets around the building.
5271,"I love Alnwick Gardens! It has great disabled access and is a great day out for all the family.  The paths were all good and although a little steep in places, they were easy to navigate in a powerchair.  Lots of features, flowers galore and a nice sensory type water feature garden.  Fully accessible tree house that houses a café and a more expensive restaurant area (didn't use). The tree house is totally accessible and even has a couple of rope bridges that my powerchair and I coped well with (great fun!) The whole site is well laid out, parking is a doddle and disabled entry prices are at a concessionary rate with a free carer ticket.  There are a few areas that you can buy and eat food at and a lovely gift shop. Also plenty of places to sit down and have a picnic. Overall it was fab! "
5272,Both the main museum and the Nijntje museum have accessible toilets.
5273,"Lots of wheelchair access but no visible loop system for very quiet auditory experience (in temporary display gallery). Lighting dim, making pictures harder to see. Many exhibits raised up above height of wheelchair user. However, staff very welcoming and helpful, 2 manual wheelchairs to borrow, building majority slopes not steps."
5274,Access was fine but marked it down one star due to the first choice of tables that we were placed at far side
5275,"There is a car park for visitors as The Milk Barn isn't conveniently close to public transport. The car park is fairly big, but it is gravelly making it a little bumpy to cross. "
5276,There is 1-2cm lip to enter off the footpath. Otherwise it is level access throughout. It is a push/pull door but staff are always there to greet you if you were needing help with the door. There is lots of space between tables to navigate the restaurant. You can either order from your table using their app or go up to the counter to design your own pizza. The counter is low but it may be difficult to see all the toppings available if using a wheelchair. 
5277,Good size and well equipped.  You need to go in and reverse out.  Not quite enough room to turn round.
5278,All were very helpful and efficient.  The welcome and check out were fine as well and all staff made the visit a good experience.
5279,Excellent we were met on our arrival at the front door since they knew we were coming and were shown to the cafe which was our requirement.   Very friendly and helpful staff both in Reception and in the Cafe where we were well looked after.
5280,"Recently refurbished pub is very big so has good spaces between tables and chairs.
Doors are heavy so you will need help from another person if using a wheelchair or stick.
Tables are high enough for wheelchairs to fit under which is always welcome.
Staff were pleasant but the food was just ok.  Average pub food that felt like it was from a chain pub.  It recently was taken over and they removed all the microbrewery to go down a different path.  
Disabled toilet was easily accessed, clean and large enough."
5281,Very clean and tidy. It was also used as a baby changing station
5282,Cinema located in The Forge shopping centre which you enter up a ramped entrance with some disabled seating areas located at the back of the room.
5283,Staff were very friendly in both the reception and the gift shop. Advice was offered on how to get around and a map provided.
5284,"Nice and wide (see photos) with plenty of open ended tables to place a wheelchair. Disabled toilet available, with changing places 1-2 mins away"
5285,Very good accessible parking bays right alongside the harbour. In fact once we were out walking we found another set of accessible bays the opposite end of the harbour - so full marks for that! Plenty of buses ply their way along the main road by the harbour.
5286,The toilet is to the left of the bar and round a corner. It is awkward to get to if the place is busy as there is a large sofa along the corridor wall. The toilet inside has a great amount of room and is clean. The handrail was not securely screwed to the wall however which could have been extremely dangerous.
5287,"Two toilet complexes you can use, one has a lift to upper level, but a small disabled toilet can be used just behind the lift on the ground floor, as shown on this part of our review.



"
5288,"There was an accessible toilet in Bonfire restaurant next to the entrance. The toilet was spacious and clean. It had grab rails and an emergency cord that reached to the ground with a Euan's Guide red cord card.

When we went to Cinema Screen 3 in their Beech Street Cinema complex, I didn't use the toilet this time. However there were both accessible and Changing Places toilet."
5289,I drove and there is an accessible parking bay close to the entrance of the reception and cafe.
5290,"One toilet. No signage as to whether it was accessible.
Wasn’t able to fully assess, as the door was so heavy, I was unable to open it enough to gain access. It was very large , clean and roomy, and plenty of room for a wheelchair and a carer. Couldn’t access enough to see whether toilet had rails etc. "
5291,"They were great, nothing was an issue and they fast tracked us through so no hanging around in queues!"
5292,Clean and plenty of room.
5293,"Access for Doune Castle is varied as there are some parts you can't go but you can get into the Castle if you are game to climb the hill and then negotiate the rough hew cobbles of the entrance archway. There is a hand rail and a metre wide section which has been surfaced to try and make access easier. Once on this surface it is still quite steep to traverse but you aren't trying to rock over the lumps and bumps of the cobbles. Getting out was easier than getting in!

Once inside you can wheel along the walkway to one side of the grassed area and get a great sense of the scale of the building. You can also get in to the gift shop.

Outside of the Castle and back down by the car park is a cottage where there is a an accessible toilet. There are paths around the outside of the Castle as well is you want to explore but these may be tricky."
5294,"We walked about 20 minutes from Glasgow queen street station, but that was by choice.

I've got an taxi right up to the front once."
5295,"Good sized toilets , wide doors, hand rails.Only issue was the doors are really heavy"
5296,The toilets are far to small in the entrance area
5297,"The accessible toilet is large enough to turn your wheelchair.
As you may or may not be able to see from my poor picture the flush is on the side nearest the wall, it's a bit of a pet hate of mine but on the whole a nice clean toilet. There are grab rails if you need.

"
5298,"There is a side entrance for those not able to manage the steps at the front, this brings you into the back of the stalls where most of the wheelchair spaces are. Lifts take you to the other floors, needed to get to the bar."
5299,"Not having flown since 2013 I was invited to test the Eagle 2 Lifter at the Virgin Atlantic Base where we met Geraldine who works for Virgin. The holiday came from this and we couldn't ask for a more friendly team of people to plan this for us. Everything went like clockwork and you couldn't ask for a more professional planned trip.
Highly recommend using Virgin for any package holiday."
5300,Very friendly and welcoming. They seemed keen to help.
5301,all very attentive and helpful
5302,"Very friendly, nice service."
5303,"You need a car to get here as there is a long rough road (3 cattle grids) through the country park before you arrive at the visitor centre. There are 4 disabled parking spaces on smooth tarmac, The rest of the plentiful parking is on rough stones."
5304,Good toilets . Good size.
5305,Generally good access however within the restaurant it is not very spacious and could be difficult when maneuvering.
5306,"It's a very popular venue, so the carparking area (which is vast!) can get a little crowded at lunchtime. The surface is gravelly, not paved with tarmac."
5307,Parking just outside cottage
5308,"Access is through a large double door, with no steps outside or inside."
5309,"The O2 Brixton Academy is a major music venue in Brixton, South London, with a capacity of  almost 5000. Disabled viewing, which should always be pre-booked, is available from a platform on the left side of the stalls area, and each disabled customer booking a space is entitled to take a carer / assistant with them. Some chairs are available, but cannot be guaranteed for companions who are able to stand. The sloping floor of the stalls means there's a good view of the stage. But disabled visitors should be aware that there are steps at the entrance to the venue, which do take some negotiating!"
5310,"The cinema offers lift access up to the main area of the cinema where tickets can be purchased. The cinema also offers the option to watch a film with Audio Description, and the option to choose your seat. There are places to sit for those who use wheelchairs to sit at the front and the back of the cinema. "
5311,"Easy access into the cafe as long as there's someone to help with the door.  The door was open when we visited. 

The cafe is all level access - although getting to the back section is a tight squeeze in a wheelchair.  Front section is fine, where there are about 3 tables."
5312,"I was invited to The Gate for my input as they are working on the building and want to make it more accessible to people with disabilities. I got a look around during the week then attended Sunday service. It was a positive experience and I’m happy I was able to attend in my powerchair due to their recent adaptations. There is a good sense of community, friendly people, and good modern music. The main church is wheelchair accessible, there is an accessible toilet and a loop recorder. "
5313,"Automatic doors, lifts, and disabled toilets were all available."
5314,"Lots of space, a lift for the upstairs bedroom which also has a hoist. "
5315,Many disabled slots all on the fkat
5316,"The level access to the store is not very obvious, being a few metres to the left of the main entrance. The store is on several levels and whilst a lift is available it’s very easy to get stuck down a dead end if  you’re in a wheelchair. 
The disabled loo is hidden away at the rear of the ground floor.  It’s not signposted and we had to ask a couple of staff before we found it. It’s a combination disabled and family toilet with sinks and pedestals at two heights. It’s very spacious for manoeuvring a wheelchair BUT THERE ARE NO GRAB RAILS."
5317,"There are stairs or a small lift to access the foyer and screens. A separate set of stairs or another small lift gives access to the bar. The lifts are large enough for 1 wheelchair and 1 other person, but that's it. The bar was inaccessible for wheelchair users due to chair / table layout.

There is a slope (for everyone) to go down to the three screens. It was quite steep. Each screen has a single wheelchair spot at the back - the one I used they had to remove 2 seats to make the space.  

I understand they have audio-described and autism-friendly screenings."
5318," The staff were friendly and helpful .
 Even helped us choose what dishes to order."
5319,Very welcoming 
5320,"The Glad Café Shawlands is located in the heart of the Southside of Glasgow. It is easily accessible via bus 3, 4, 29, 38, 57, 103 or the train to Crossmyloof, Queens Park or Shawlands station. It is an award winning café/music venue, serving delicious food and a delectable programme of gigs and events. The café welcomes on ages and styles. When visiting there was a local band playing and the majority of the audience were using some form of physical aid to help assist them within the venue. After researching further into the events that are held within the café, I realised that this is a regular occurrence and that the venue prides itself on being wheel-chair friendly. This creates a highly accessible and vibrant location for all members of society to meet in forming, a positive impact of engagement on the user and the use of their occupation.  "
5321,"Accessible toilets are on each floor and they are spacious, clean and with alarm and grab rails."
5322,"Hampton Inn, the former name of this American brand group of hotels, which offer moderately priced hotels, with just the basic needs on offer.The chain was first founded in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1999, the owners Prius hotel corporation was bought by Hilton Worldwide for $3.5 million dollars. And in December 2019, the chain included 2544 hotels in 30 countries, 
with its first UK hotel opening in 2009.
This Oxford hotel opened in 2016.

It is certainly handy for Oxford, which is just a short 15 minute drive away, and it has excellent motorway connections for London and Birmingham. The hotel lies south of Oxford, right on the outskirts, and very handy if you are a football fan. The stadium for Oxford United, Kassam stadium, is named after the owner Firoz Kassam, and is situated just across the road from Hampton Hilton hotel, in an area well suited for families, as next door is the Hollywood bowl, which in itself is just a typical bowling alley. And there is a Frankie and Bennys restaurant next to this.

We personally were not impressed by its location, as close to a sewage treatment works.
This is a simple basic budget type hotel, but very clean and well looked after, with just as much facilities as is needed, no frills, but good value for what is on offer here.
Your day starts with a good buffet hot breakfast, then you can use its 24 hour fitness room, there’s an on site snack and drinks hub, handy after a workout, and of course it has free parking, but do register at the desk.

OUR REVIEW.
We arrived at an industrial site, which here held the 0xford United football ground, and a bowling alley, with the hotel tucked away in a far corner (photo 1) plain looking and typical budget style. 3 disabled bays stood next to main entrance (2) with an automatic entry door, on the flat (3).
We sat in the breakfast and evening dining area (4) plain simple deco and furniture, but very clean and well looked after.”
The reception desk was maned, which acted as the bar and hot drink counter as well (5) were we enjoyed a very nice cup of hot chocolate each (6). 
A small more comfortable lounge area (7) ideal for a quick sit down and rest, while the hallway area leads off to toilet and bedrooms (8) where a disabled toilet was available (9) with its wider door. The toilet was quite spacious, clean, nicely tiled, with pull cord and grab rails (10), and modern fixtures (11).

Off the hallway are typical bedrooms (12) with tea making facilities (13) TV, and wardrobe ect, while the bathroom was very pleasant, smallish, with a shower unit, which had a small step to get up (14) but with usual pull cord and grab rail.  The bed itself was a tidy King Size bed, Comfortable looking, and just about enough room to struggle into bed. (mind you, this may have not been a disabled bedroom, the young foreign speaking cleaning lady did not fully understand what we wanted to see.)
Next to bedrooms is a door for the fitness centre (16) but very small and with limited equipment (17).

Beyond the hotel itself, just a few yards away, stood a Hollywood Bowl centre (18) and next to this a Frankie and Benny restaurant (19) and across the car park stands the Oxford United football ground (20).

OUR FINAL THOUGHTS
A Plain simple budget type hotel, very clean and well looked after, ideal for a quick overnight stay, especially if you are sporty types, and a family.
We were not impressed ourselves with the surrounding area, but if this is the type of budget hotel you require, then we would recommend this hotel, because of its cleanliness and appearance."
5323,"The staff I meet were knowledgeable, helpful and very keen to make the experience of visiting a good one. Some creative thinking was evident about opening up the performances to as wider audience as possible. There were infa red sound systems, induction loops, sighted guide training and more."
5324,There is an accessible Loo at this centre and it has plenty of room to move around in and a low sink to use. 
5325,"There is level access into Jolly’s Wetherspoons, there are 2 sets of double doors to enter though which I need help with as they are not automatic, and they are quite heavy. When I visited the doors were left open as it was quite a warm day. Inside there are 2 seating areas, both are quite spacious but can be harder to get through when it is busy. Most of the tables are at wheelchair height and it is easy enough to get to the bar in a wheelchair because there no tables or chairs in the way."
5326,"Many parts are accessible but it is an ancient building so some steps to access all rooms. Audio guide in multiple languages, and staff to descr various aspects of the history. "
5327,"Wetroom with good facilities, toilet raider available "
5328,"Had heard great things about the new Oriam Sports Centre and we weren't disappointed! Accessible parking near entrance, automatic doors at entrance and AMAZING sports facilities inside! There is a full size indoor football pitch with viewing area, several sports halls, a fitness suite and a cafe. A great venue."
5329,"Could get in from a side street and there was a member of staff ready to gather us up as we arrived to pick up tickets at the Box Office. We went down the side street and in a side door and came straight in at circle level. The seats are on one side so do have a slightly restricted view, very much reflected in the pricing, so it's a bit like a box for two (you and your carer). There were two moveable seats but one was quickly taken out to make space for the wheelchair. "
5330,"visited with my partner ....we are both registered blind  with differing levels of remaining vision, she is a wheelchair user. I have to completely disagree with the initial review 
the seating is pot luck depending on the  screen number itself, example we saw guardians of the galaxy 2,  SCREEN 6 this has a viewing box left of center ...which not ideal was still viewable for me. We then went to see alien covenant. SCREEN 1 as far back right than it could have been!....i could not see the picture and the sound was awful due to placement ...of both the box and the speakers .... i feel disabled access is an after thought ....shame on cineworld as their staff are really helpful.... the designers have no clue about disabled peoples needs"
5331,A good accessible loo in the cafe entrance area
5332,Helpful but not a hassle in anyway. Made no fuss but made things easy - that is quite an art.
5333,"Accessible toilets are available on the ground floor as well as the first and second floors. Access to these is via a RADAR key or by asking at the information desk. The accessible toilet on the ground floor (we used this one) was spacious, bright and clean with all the expected features."
5334,"Very large open space with very few doors to negotiate. The gym area is spacious with a good amount of equipment suitable for wheelchair users with instructors on hand to help out if needed. Good sized accessible changing facilities both in the gym and at poolside. On poolside the changing facilities are only a few metres away from the pool. Each of the pools have a hoist if required to allow wheelchair users access to the pool.
The cafe area has plenty of space for moving around."
5335,The entrance is reasonably accessible with two sets of double doors.
5336,"The stadium can be reachable by public transport. There are Keith and Huntly railway stations located in around 20 miles away from the ground, south-west and south-southwest directions respectively. MacDuff is the nearest bus station to the ground. A car is the easiest option if you're wanting to go to Princess Royal Park."
5337,"The staff are exceptionally highly-strung - one of them followed me round the whole time, afraid I might fall and break something - and their attitude to disability seems to be stuck somewhere in the 1970s. They are friendly when it comes to talking about the history of the house and its objects and the garden, for this they get half a star. For disability-awareness, zero."
5338,Accessible toilets on the ground floor near the lift. 
5339,"Ample space, wide smooth paths and accessible toilets dotted throughout - this really is a great accessible greenspace. I loved the wetland area with winding boardwalk, it had been raining and wasn't too slippy at all. The toilets I came across were clean and spacious, and the signposting throughout this park is fantastic. The cafes are all easily accessible too!"
5340,"This is a small family owned cafe on the Main Street in  Lochwinnoch. The food is highly recommended. Lovely sandwiches, soup and cakes. I normally get food to take away as the cafe is quite small and very popular and so can get very busy. I went in today for the first time today with my assistance dog and the staff could not have been more helpful "
5341,"The approach to the pub's step-free entrance has nasty bumpy cobbles (one star lost for this). Apart from that, access into the pub is easy and there's plenty of room to move around. Most tables are wheelchair-friendly, beware of those with a cross-bar at floor level, these are wheelchair-UNfriendly but they are a minority among the many tables there. The bar counter is very high so you might want to bring a periscope if you're a wheelchair user. "
5342,"Visited with our family as a get together as a birthday treat for our son Craig who is profoundly physically disabled with complex needs.  Homelands Trust more than met those needs, the accommodation is superb, fitted out to the highest standard with top of the range equipment and was spotlessly clean on our arrival.  The staff at Homelands were very friendly, approachable, and were able to accommodate our request for equipment to suit his requirements.  Knowing that we were coming for Craig's birthday, they even left out a birthday card for him, a real surprise.

We had a delightful stay and all of us agreed that we will return again many times in the future, many thanks to all."
5343,Assistance staff always cheerful and friendly
5344,"Disabled access is integral to the Yard and starts with level access to the wide front door. The door is easy to use and takes you into the main space which is on one level with plenty of space. Off this area are other rooms, including the large kitchen, all wheelchair accessible. Doors lead out into the outdoor play space with tarmac paths and ramps to the various themed areas."
5345,"It's in town, so good for public transport, but unsure where exactly the accessible parking spaces would be. "
5346,As a wheelchair user I find it very hard to find budget wheelchair friendly hotels.  Though we were in a standard room I found the facilities were perfectly adequate to use with crutches and help from my husband.  There was a small lip on the door and a step up to the bathroom so would not be suitable for someone who could not transfer from wheelchair.
5347,"The Fitzrovia Chapel, was once the chapel of the former Middlesex Hospital. It has been restored and has a stunning Byzantine interior, with a golden ceiling, beautiful mosaics and stained glass windows. The chapel is small but there is lots to enjoy. Access is very good and step free. 

There is free admission for its open days, which are on Wednesdays between 11am and 4pm. However, there maybe a charge for other events. Please check opening times before visiting. "
5348,The venue has its own car park which is free for blue badge holders. These spaces do not need to be booked in advance. 
5349,"For parking, check the Council website at https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20043/disability_and_accessibility. There's not much at some University buildings but blue badge holders can park in residents only bays as well as disabled bays on the roads."
5350,Very spacious.
5351,Tight for space but accessible for most wheelchairs. No changing place or anything like that.
5352,"Plenty of parking spaces , some adjacent to restaurant. No dedicated disabled parking spaces. Tarmac surface"
5353,"Return visitors to this wonderful cottage , The standard and quality of this cottage is outstanding ! Every base has been covered for visitors with mobility and sensory disability's . From wheelchairs to hearing loops and so many more too numerous to list . The amount of Information and guides for disabled visitors is immense . The host's really do go the extra mile to make sure there guests stay is as carefree and happy as possible . I would highly recommend this cottage to anyone ! you will not be disappointed . "
5354,Staff are generally accommodating and helpful. Front of house staff are aware of wheelchairs and so used to offering help as needed. Rating 5
5355,"The main entrance has two automatic doors which operate with a push-pad system. On one occasion this was broken, however staff at the nearby reception desk were on hand to help keep the door open. There are two lifts, one each side of the main linking corridor that allow wheelchair users to access the upper floors of the main gallery. All rooms have step free access, and any elevated platforms come complete with ramps. The majority of the exhibits are easy to navigate. There is a single lift at the back onto Argyle street, accessible via push pad doors, with a walkway onto the street level."
5356,I only encountered one disabled toilet but it was very large and had all the expected rails et cetera. I have attached a photo
5357,Just say you know the team at Tobii and you'll get a warm welcome at reception :)
5358,Toilets are in the hotel next door but you can go straight through from Starbucks without going outside. The hotel lobby area is thick carpeted so it was a bit like wheeling through treacle. The toilets were very clean and had sufficient grab rails for me.
5359,"We popped in to grab coffee from their little tearoom.

The garden centre and tearoom are wheelchair accessible, with predominantly smooth tarmac and tile surfaces. There are a few tight spots between displays in the indoor part, but alternative routes were available.

The garden centre has two manual wheelchairs that can be borrowed by customers whilst shopping. They are stored at the tills, which are through the doors to the left as you pass through the entrance gate. 

The tea room is accessible. Dining furniture was very sparse inside due to COVID so I’m unsure how close the tables would normally be to each other. The coffee and cake were lovely, with gluten-free options available. I can highly recommend the GF cherry and coconut sponge.
"
5360,"Easy to find, very large, and clean. "
5361,"There are 2 disabled parking bays just by the entrance (you go in to the golf range entrance, not to the shop). 
Not sure about public transport."
5362,"Rooms all have excellent wetroom facilities so unless you really need to have a disabled equipped room you may be able to manage with a standard room. Lift to all floors. Level access. Lots of seating in dining area and lounge. Only 2 down sides: 1) the corridor doors are not automatic and are  very heavy so can be difficult to open if you are using a walker or wheelchair. 2) the accessible rooms are only available as a double bed, no twin bed accessible rooms. We have stayed here dozens of times because it's pet friendly, has easy use facilities and plenty of disabled parking."
5363,I came in to the salon first to book an appointment and was given a tour of the salon to make sure I was comfortable with the access. Great experience and look forward to going back.
5364,"There is one accessible toilet within the restaurant, with a wide door. The toilet is of a good height, with a fixed rail on the right-hand side and a drop-down rail on the left, with space for side transfer. The toilet is fairly small, and access might be difficult at times when the restaurant was busy, as there is a table positioned close to the toilet door, though this was not in use when we visited."
5365,"Parking close to shop entrance, no disabled bay as not needed"
5366,"By car: The hotel is a 3-4 minute drive from Glasgow Queen Street station, the nearest train station.  Parking is available outside the hotel.  Taxis can drop off outside the hotel but may not be able to stop by the kerb depending on space availability.  The hotel are able to call for taxis which normally arrive within 5 minutes.
Walking: Glasgow Queen Street rail station is an 8 minute walk from the hotel.  I would allow 15-20 minutes to be safe, especially as at the time of writing there is major construction work going on at the station which may cause some delay.
"
5367,downstairs disabled toilet however not very easy to get to as there are many chairs and tables in the way with very narrow walkways
5368,"Always a warm, friendly, helpful welcome from staff and volunteers. The bar is open before shows and has a lowered counter area."
5369,Full wet room and accessible toilet with rails.
5370,"We used the buses to get there so don't have any experience of driving or parking in Rome. Buses were easily accessible for my partner, and staff were all very helpful."
5371,"There is parking next to the bus station however we did not visit this area. This is a good few minutes walk for someone with a disability. 
There is also a Taxi rank on the far away side of the station we did visit the Taxi rank and it had a number of car able to take wheelchairs. However we did not visit the train station area."
5372,"Roamed far and wide on one of the Park's mobility scooters, taking in impressive sculptures."
5373,Swing door to toilet area but otherwise good
5374,Open plan entrance into the Buchanan Galleries. Plenty of room and fairly easy to get a spot to park as a wheelchair user.
5375,"This restaurant is in the centre of London, so it's not the easiest place to access in a private vehicle. However, once you get into the restaurant it is extremely easy to access. There is limited parking available near to the venue, so the best transport route would be via taxi (plenty of which can accommodate wheelchairs around London) or via the bus."
5376,Staff well trained and aware of access needs.
5377,"You're introduced to a waitress/waiter when you arrive, they then take care of all your needs. The waitress we had was very knowledgeable about dishes and the wine."
5378,A quirky old hotel with very friendly staff! Some accessibility issues but overall a good stay!
5379,We travelled by car. As away supporters our home club could not provide us with a car parking space. I phoned St Johnstone very late (the day before the match) and they made huge efforts to magic a space for us in their fully booked car park. When we arrived later than planned due to traffic the steward recognised that it would be a tricky journey from our allocated space and directed us to a much handier space.
5380,Plenty of parking
5381,"Staff were friendly at the desk and in the shop, but we didn't really need any help."
5382,Always friendly and helpful and will give you directions on the best route via ramp and lifts to the exhibits or exhibitions you wish to visit.
5383,There are accessible toilets in the spa/main reception and restaurant
5384,Level
5385,We met the owners who could not do enough to make sure we had a good stay
5386,"not friendly or helpful, in fact they were quite disparaging"
5387,Flat entrance to hotel and to the new wing.
5388,"Excellent access for disable, assistant dogs well looked after and travel for free."
5389,The park is being refurbished which is taking many years from a neglected state. Good range of species but natural woodland/rocks and compacted soil paths. Poor toilets. Very bumpy but easy to bump over on a powerchair. Basic foods on our visit.  Worth visiting to support upgrade work.
5390,"Villa Timily was the perfect villa for my family of 2 adults and 2 children aged 15 and 12. The area was suitable for my electric scooter, as I am disabled.
Arranged a hire car through Sundance with Cy-Breeze. Nick was waiting for us at the airport and was very helpful, car was only a few months old  
The welcome pack was really nice... picked by someone who had put some thought into it.
The villa was spotless with a good sized open plan kitchen, dining room and living area. The 3 double bedrooms were very spacious. There was a family shower room and a very large en suite wet room. The ramps to the front door and to the pool were great but there was even a ramp over the rail for the patio door making it very easy to get in and out. All doors were wide enough for most wheelchairs or scooters. The wet room was brilliant with lots of space to turn my scooter around. There was a support rail next to the toilet and a fold-up stool on the wall ..."
5391,"Plenty of lifts. 

However it was quite busy so that maybe off putting to those that have sensory issues."
5392,Good quality approx 100m away
5393,"6 of us (3 generations) + 1 dog stayed at the Moat House for 3 nights. This included  my father whose mobility is restricted and he uses a 3-wheeled walker to get around.  The hard floors of the house suited his 'wheelie' well, he was glad of the rise-and-recline chairs in the lounge and adapted bathroom facilities and was able to explore the garden.  The automatic sensor lights in the hallways were a blessing for night-time trips.  Many thoughtful extras in this well-equipped and attractive house."
5394,"Staff were lovely. When my son ate his paper drinking straw through overwhelm, they brought him a handful. They were cheerful and friendly and talkative, and it felt like we were no trouble at all. "
5395,"It was good to find somewhere accessible for me and where I could bring my furry friend. Unfortunately, despite some nice touches, the accommodation had some drawbacks. Though for other people, these may not be an issue especially if you're aware in advance.there are four cottages in all here - maybe one of the others would have suited our party of four (me disabled, husband plus two 80+ in laws)"
5396,"Steps into both main entrances to the church.
Seating outside available Disabled access is along a flagstone path through the gates and into the back of the church. there is a bit of a ridge up onto the path, we had difficulty getting up onto it with a manual wheelchair. Signage poor, we had to ask someone to show us where to go. Several doors to access before entering church beside the alter, plenty of space for wheelchairs inside the church.
Induction Loop is available, signage advising of this in church"
5397,Brilliant. I have visited a number of times.
5398,"Excellent disabled access. Fully accessible, the legacy bar is located in another building across the grounds of the distillery but there is a lift that can take you up to the legacy bar as well.  "
5399,It’s their shared use policy during function room hiring which is limiting. Having 20+ spectators share the disabled wcs after copious use of the coffee machines for the 2/3hour duration of the cricket sessions whilst perfectly available public loos are out of bounds as they are deemed private when the function room is hired even though they are not attached or via the function room
5400,very helpful
5401,"A brilliant Theatre! There is accessible seating areas. A working lift that has access to all floors and a disabled toilet on the bottom floor. Access to backstage and on the stage, just some of the dressing rooms are inaccessible to wheelchair users."
5402,"Overall impressive.

There appears to be 2 or 3 entrances to the complex. Look out for the small, white ticket offices, at standing height. I went to the first one I came to and  it only had stairs, with a hand rail and the person suggested I might want to use the 2nd entrance along as it had ramp and stairs access. There is a  sculpture called Barlovento, just by the entrance.  I have posted a photo of the step free entrance, so you know what to look out for. When I visited there were no queues. 

If you use the step free entrance there is a special area reserved for disabled people almost immediately in front and a step free, sloping entrance to one of the pools. It was here I saw the aqua wheelchair, which I also photographed.

The complex itself is very large and spacious. There are about 7 pools to swim in, I think the majority of the pools are accessible by steps without hand rails. There are lots of ramps as well as stairs to access the main areas and facilities. However there are some terraced areas which are only accessible by steps without handrails, however, with my crutch I found these managable. The island bar is only accessible by crossing a small bridge with 2 steps up and then 2 steps down, the bridge is made of planks of wood so I had to position my crutch so it didn't get caught in the gaps."
5403,"Housed in the historic Prussian arsenal on Unter den Linden and a new exhibition building designed by I.M. Pei, this museum is highly accessible and well worth a visit. Not all captions are translated but you can have an audio guide in English which highlights some exhibits. We also enjoyed god quality coffee and croissants in the museum restaurant."
5404,Reasonably frequent Lothian Bus 8 goes pass. 
5405,The entrance to the restaurant is spacious but there is a very steep ramp which only could take a wheelchair if it was pushed with great force. Also the tables are very close together so this would make it difficult to fit a wheelchair.
5406,there plenty of disabled spaces & there bus stops nearby
5407,I did not use them on this occasion.
5408,There is a standard disabled loo in the pub with grab rails. It was well serviced. If you are staying here the bedroom loo in the accessible room is excellent.
5409,"Great store, very wide isles and great parking."
5410,Large accessible toilets for wheelchair users. 
5411,"We parked in the main car park which is now accessible for wheelchairs.  If that is full however, the overflow car park is in a field so would not be so easy."
5412,"The first thing that was really noticeable was the size of the carpark, huge, and there were plenty of disabled spaces.  Some of the spaces were near to the entrance/exit.  The ground was my first easy to wheel on surface of the day.  
"
5413,"Xmas shopping, loved the new café which had an accessible counter, and also the accessible payment point at the tills, which save you navigating the queuing system. Easy to get around, plenty of room to navigate a wheelchair between displays"
5414,Level entry from the door to the wheelchair space. Plenty of room for a powerchair.
5415,"This was my first outing in a wheelchair but it went smoothly, staff were friendly and on the whole the museum was accessible"
5416,Buses are frequent and go into Glasgow and surrounding areas. Parking for disabled is abundant in the multistory car park and outside 
5417,"Extremely popular with locals and tourists alike, the Blue Fox Café in Downtown Victoria BC is sure to please with both a traditional and creative  menu.  The friendly and helpful stuff  serve outstanding breakfast/brunch and lunch dishes, which are generous and delicious. Definitely worth the wait!
"
5418,An accessible toilet is available on the ground floor and is to the left of the approach to the Leisure Complex.
5419,To get to the hotel by car you have to get through some fairly narrow street. They have an underground carpark just round the corner from the main entrance and a drop off point right outside the entrance. The carpark is unsuitable for vehicles with a topbox.
5420,this is a good size with the pull cord only one problem is the cord is often tucked behind the bin in the toilet
5421,"They public accessible toilet on the ground floor had recently been refurbished. It was spacious, clean and with a single grab rail on the left hand side."
5422,"Due to where the building is situated there is no accessible parking, in fact, no parking adjacent to the building, however, do not let this put you off as there is parking close by, no more than 5min walk away.
The rail and bus stations are also no more than 5min walk. "
5423,"92 Degrees coffee shop is located on a main road with good pavements and crossings, near several bus stops, taxi ranks, and a car park. The door was propped open and completely level, and while the counter was higher than I would have liked for a wheelchair user, it was much better than a lot of other coffee shops. There was plenty of space to move around inside, and the majority of the tables and chairs were accessible from a wheelchair. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and while there is only one toilet in the unit, it is a gender neutral accessible toilet."
5424,Lifts are on the small-side.
5425,"Good road links and trains
Great venue / Good artists"
5426,"Tables were a little tight, so tricky to get through where our table was in the middle, but it's all on one level, with completely level access (on the second floor of the centre, on the left hand side if you're using the escalator). I went with a friend on wednesday afternoon so it was a nice chilled out lunch. Staff were friendly. There's a disabled toilet with handrails and pull cord. I didn't see a changing place. Food was super good and staff didn't rush us. I'd definitely go again"
5427,Friendly helpful staff. Discreetly assisted me without making a big issue. All the staff were attentive.
5428,"Access is direct to the cafe or via the shop. It's on the ground floor at the front. Floors nice and smooth, no steps. Front door is a bit awkward but a staff member saw us and hurried across to help. Circulation space inside can be a bit tight if it's busy but there are plenty of seats in two seating areas. There's a brand spanking new disabled loo.  Staff helpful and pleasant. I shall visit again."
5429,"Quite difficult to find, lack of signage. RADAR key required. There was only enough room for me in my powerchair which was okay as I can transfer independently but I still felt it cosy. Red cord hanging to the floor which is fab. Sink has space to roll under. There were two bins against the wall that made it look more cluttered ( Accessible toilet is also a baby change)"
5430,All the staff were helpful on site and gave directions when required and the member of staff who booked the parking was very friendly.
5431,"The entrance to the shop is comfortably step-free. At the time of my visit all dining was still outside. The outdoor tables are well-spaced, ideal for wheelchair users. "
5432,Great -  super helpful and super enthusiastic.
5433,It’s on street parking 
5434,Janet and Jon were extremely helpful and interested if there was any way that they could improve the lodge for the disabled.
5435,"A Witherspoon pub.  City centre so not quite as cheap as out of town establishments, but still very good, unpretentious value."
5436,"There are Blue Badge spaces next to the main entrance these were empty during our visit but will no doubt fill up quickly at busy times in the store These are on both sides of the main doors in to the store. 
The nearest bus stops are around 10mins away from this store and include going up a step hill to get on to the main road at the Coatdyke Roundabout . 
"
5437,"Staff could not be faulted from start to finish. Staff worked hard to enable each person to achieve their own goal, even enabling a wheel chair user to climb independently a small way! Staff had each persons dignity  and well being at heart, ensuring at each stage the person was comfortable with the amount of contact they had while attaching the harness etc. The service here could not be faulted in any way, all staff worked brilliantly to give  each person a fantastic experience!!"
5438,Toilet was very good but I did wonder why there wasn't a red cord. I almost flooded the caravan as the shower drain DO NOT work.
5439,Super friendly and approachable 
5440,"This was NOT a good experience. I went into the Apple Store to get my iPad fixed. I had my Face Mask Exempt badge From Euan’s Guide on and displayed clearly. I also had my long cane with me to show that I was Visually Impaired. 

When we arrived I was asked to put a face mask on. My parents explained that due to my visual impairment it was difficult for me to wear a face mask and that I didn’t need to - but the people in the store were adamant that I was to wear one. 

As I didn’t have a face mask, I was asked to put a visor on.  This was particularly sore and very tight on my head, which has had a lot of surgery on it. 

I also have diabetes insipidus, meaning that if my medication runs out in my body, I need to drink a lot of water which passes through my body very quickly. 

When we asked if I could use the bathroom, they replied that the bathrooms were closed due to COVID-19. Dad then explained that it was a necessity. After a bit of hard persuading I was able to use the bathroom. "
5441,There are several car parks close by and some disabled spaces reasonably near by
5442,There's a small car park outside with at least one disabled parking spot. There's a concrete slope to access the building and two sets of wooden double doors to get in. The doors may be a little heavy if you are on your own. Access around the pub is good and the disabled toilet was clean however not in the best located if the pub is busy. 
5443,"Very nice, and attentive."
5444,"Nobody helped us from the car park. They did once we were inside. Nobody explained or apologised that we hadn't been given a sea view, which we had booked."
5445,Looking was easy to find being cafe but very narrow entrance and difficult to get in with a wheelchair. Reasonable cleanliness.
5446,"The paths are very smooth and wide, and there are countless benches all around the gardens. The paths do get very steep as the edges of the garden stretch up to reach Princes Street above, but these can be easily avoided. There is a nice cafe in the garden too. With the exception of the odd train passing by, the gardens feel much more quiet and tranquil than East Princes Street Gardens."
5447,"Flat step free entrance with wide corridor. Toilets and lift well signed
A lift to get up to the cafe. "
5448,"The French Quarter is l on one level with easy access curbs at all road junctions. Most of it is pedestrianised so safe to use the streets. Lots of options of restaurants. Lots of art for sale, street artists doing magic, gymnastics and great live music. "
5449,Lift to reception / rooms. Our room was standard / twin accessible with level entry shower. Plenty of room to get besides the beds but probably not to be able to rotate a hoist in the room we had.
5450,Hardstanding parking outside cabin. Steep slope down to cabin and parking. 2 miles from train station at Ludlow. Good blue badge parking in Ludlow.
5451,There were many disabled toilets located within the cinema on all floors and near all the screens to allow easy access. Within the toilets there were identifiable pull chords in the case of an emergency and there was also a variety of grab rails in the correct places around the toilet. There was also space for a carer in the toilets if needed.
5452,Disabled parking spaces at front of building.  McGills bus service no 26 runs past building with stops directly outside.
5453,4 spaces next to the front door
5454,Overall great but my pal who was using a manual wheelchair found the lift to be a little on the small size. When you get on to the first floor there is step free access to the cafe where you can get a very tasty bacon sandwich! Unfortunately there is a significant step to get out on to the balcony but if you go back out of the cafe and along the corridor there is another door that will lead out to the balcony. The Watersports Centre is a perfect base to explore the loch. Head to the reception area (dropped counter) and they can tell you about the wheelchair accessible speedboat - in busy times you should definitely phone and book ahead. There are also bikes that are perfect for a passenger. One style is side by side - with a bar to rest your feet on if you don’t wish to use the pedals. The other style has a seat at the front with the cyclist behind
5455,Couldn't have been more helpful.
5456,"Cost £30.50 for 1 adult, 1 carer, 2 children (1 disabled and one a teenager) we didn't need to provide evidence of carer. once we paid in we got a pass to allow free entry for the next year so we can visit as often as we want. Cafe is quite small and price wise on a par with other tourist places £3.50 for a child's meal deal. £1.00 for a soft drink. Some of the tables were higher for wheelchair users. Activities were all accessible the only one were couldn't ask were some ladders to see into one of the tanks.

All in all a good morning /afternoon out. It takes about 2 hours to go round it."
5457,"A slight lip to enter the building but all smooth floors, wide doorways, clear signage and no obstacles."
5458,"Arriving by tube from London Bridge I found it fairly easy to get to with short walk from the station into Borough High Street and then into the Market. There's a covered passage way on the far side of the street that takes you from the High Street into the market area. It does have a bit of a slope downward so you can avoid that by going a few metres further down the High Street where you go in via the Market Hall - a glass looking building with loads of seats, plants and an accessible loo."
5459,"The outward bus driver helped load my wheelchair and luggage and was friendly. The return driver completely ignored me, did not put out the ramp and gave no help whatsoever with wheelchair or luggage. I sat in a seat and held on to my folded wheelchair. Had I been sat in the chair I am sure it would have been thrown  across the bus as the driving was so aggressive and there was no securing mechanism for the wheelchair."
5460,"I feel like accessibility was an afterthought. 
A few inch step into the cafe. 
Only accessible to those in a very slim manual chair, but not if it's busy as there isn't much room inside. Would be difficult for assistance dogs to lay under the tables or nearby.
I have a Quickie Helium (42cm seat width & 3 degrees camber), I could only just fit in through the front door & navigate through the cafe."
5461,"There are two easy-to-find accessible toilets. Both have a turning circle, chairs, low sinks, and grab rails. They are always clean and tidy and there is space for a carer. There are red emergency cords that hang to the floor inbetween the toilet and the chair and have Euans guide signs on them"
5462,Apart from the step at the front door it's great.
5463,The Priory Centre car park is run down. There are only 2 disabled spaces which are hidden away and the markings are almost disappeared! 
5464,"The staff were very friendly and spoke great English. There was always someone on hand to assist with using the lifts, which were staff operated. "
5465,We stayed for the weekend. We took my wife’s wheelchair and car boot mobility scooter. Both were fine for moving about the site - both inside and out. A bit more tricky if you wanted to go to the footpath by the adjoining Chichester Harbour.
5466,"From arriving to getting seated by the window it was easy. Plenty of room to manoeuvre through the restaurant, moveable tables and chairs to fit us in,  good loo and great staff. Not a noisy environment, felt comfortable and relaxed."
5467,"Important to keep in mind York central is very busy, there is no car parking or bus stops right outside though it is still an option. Disabled parking are a 5 min walk and if you're coming from the train station is a very easy to find about a 5 min walk!"
5468,"There is a ramp to one entrance, and the doors open wide. However, these are not automatic doors and are relatively heavy, so a person in a wheelchair would be dependent on a secondary person to gain access. There are rails on the staircases, however, not at either entrances to the building. There are no lifts, but there are a few rooms downstairs which are prioritised for those with a disability. However, these rooms are small. Throughout the house, the corridors are wide and stone floors, so easier access."
5469,"Not a strong staff presence around the hotel. Chef on duty was helpful, Bar Staff/ Server not so friendly and brought us the wrong drinks"
5470,"Very helpful, supervisor came and took us to our seats, and after waited for us to get ready and helped upstairs. "
5471,"Lots of buses go up and down Piccadilly, and Green Park Station is very nearby and is fully step-free (when the lifts are working - check before you travel!)."
5472,Plentiful and spacious 
5473,"This outing to Malham Cove is another ""Miles without Stiles"" route -- it won't be for everyone but a great close up view of the Cove awaits if you can manage it. A route card is available free of charge from the Visitor Centre in Malham or see the National Park/Miles without Stiles webpage."
5474,"Helpful, attentive and cheerful"
5475,On street parking and good bus thanks
5476,"Several bus routes pass nearby, but there are no step-free stations in the area.

"
5477,There are ramps and an ambi-lift.
5478,"All staff were very friendly and helpful, in what must be difficult times for them"
5479,"The toilet was very spacious. Clean and tidy.
"
5480,"This place is lovely and relaxing and all types of people would love to sit and enjoy the surroundings.
The entrance path and the top is very accessible with wide paths and at the top  there are some gently slopping grass areas that you can get magnificent view over the lake.
The area down to the lake is a series of paths and a herb garden which has a number of steps into and out of it.
The herb garden is interesting and if you can manage the steps, which aren't too awkward then its worth it.
We are obsessed with plant buying plants - good selection in both the front and in the garden which are both accessible.
The centre/cafe is accessible - never used it and it would appeal to those who fancy a cuppa before or after the gardens. "
5481,All the staff were so friendly and helpful. They were very attentive and accommodating – nothing was a problem for them. 
5482,"Access is very good with lifts to both platforms and an underground tunnel to take you from one side of the station to the other for the different platforms.

The station uses the RNIB React service to provide audio description to visually impaired visitors.  Signage was good, clear and easy to follow."
5483,"Study any good map and the trail is easy to trace from Ashbourne to Buxton with several accessible points, mainly where there used to be stations or where there is a decent car park. Some of the bridge/road points are not accessible. We got on at Hartington Station."
5484,"Access throughout the Castle, which is a very large area, is good if you can cope with the cobbles and some of the gradients. The steepest part is getting from the main entrance up into the castle precincts. If you find this difficult you can arrange to use the mobility vehicle which can drive you up into the castle. Not all areas are cobbled but the main routes are. I found this possible using a power chair albeit uncomfortable at times. I felt it worth the effort as once you get to one of the attractions such as the museums you are back on level ground."
5485,"Ground floor access, help bell outside, automatic door"
5486,"They were very helpful, and seemed ery keen to do a good job."
5487,The staff could not have beeen more helpful or polite. I had to have a different wheelchair to get me onto the plane but Monach airline had actually not booked anyone in the jounrney in and back for no extra cost and this meant I could sleep during the flights which was important.
5488,You really have to drive to this location
5489,Easily accessible and very clean.
5490,There are only a few steps and is a mini-lift/stairlift you can use. Once up the steps it is flat throughout. The toilets are a long walk unless you have a radar key to use the short cut door.
5491,A wheelchair accessible airport with several accessible restaurant and shop. Also has amazing staff.
5492,Staff were conversational and knowledgeable about topics. All tour guides seemed friendly and enjoyed engaging in conversation with the visitors.
5493,Only drop off zone facilities available outside the restaurant but plenty of public transport can be used.
5494,There were two spacious accessible and clean toilets. 
5495,"The Kilted kangaroo is a large and open Australia themed bar in the centre of Stirling. It has a good range of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks as well as good pub food. The staff are very friendly and it has off street parking accessed via the alleyway. There are screens showing sports events and it has an extensive outdoor beer garden area. There is an accessible loo which is spacious however, it did not have a red cord. "
5496,The Black Bull is on Leith Street so within short walking distance of Waverley Station and local bus routes. 
5497,The access is excellent with level access into the restaurant  with a ramp to the area which includes the disabled toilet
5498,The accessible loos aren't on every floor and this can be a problem if you have to wait for the lift.  No handrails on the right when I last used.
5499,The flexibility and enthusiasm of staff was noted. Whilst being quite open about not being designed for wheelchair access they were willing to explore what might work.
5500,This is a great place has great food but unfortunately is difficult to manage with an electric wheelchair. If you're going to visit you'll need a strong bladder! 
5501,There are two disabled parking spaces very close to the level walkway to the door
5502,"There is a ramp leading into the airport where you are met with Braille directions and automatic doors. Immediately inside the arrivals area, there are toilets including a large accessible loo - but be aware you might need to move through a bit of a crowd to reach them. At the departures lounge, disabled access was much more obvious. There was an electronic accessibility information podium to give you directions, disabled access information and useful tips. I spotted it immediately. The airport was entirely level access throughout, and everything was clearly signposted. The food outlets are very hectic however - so be prepared for scattered queues and bustling about at tills and collection points."
5503,Staff available to help at counters. 
5504,Disabled toilet was good but no changing facilities.
5505,"There are no accessible public toilets on the racecourse, but they are available in the “Duchess stand” at each end of the main stand.
And on the smaller “Queens stand” the disabled toilet are over on the right hand corner. 
Don’t expect anything fancy, just use if needed, they will be clean enough, but I would hold back if possible until you reach a hotel or arrive home."
5506,"An excellent place, with many beauties, easy access and lots of squirrels. Strongly recommended."
5507,It was particularly good for access to public transport as they were bus stops immediately outside and it's only a short walk to the train station is both Queen Street and Central. Plenty of taxis were in evidence as they passed by the door frequently.
5508,I recently attended an open day and found the people the canal boats and the bungalows very good for electric wheelchairs
5509,"Overall thought accessibility was great, however I did find the surfaces in the hallways incredibly shiny and reflective. The restaurant is spacious and bright which is fantastic. Trying to find the toilets did become a bit of a challenge however - I followed the signs out of the restaurant but walked right past the toilets because of the tiniest sign on a really dark surface! That being said, the toilets were luxurious when found."
5510,Seemed friendly and happy to be there as there was little trouble.
5511,"This famous (some would say infamous) building designed by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers is well worth a visit even if none if the current exhibitions interests you. There's a restaurant, a cafe, a children's play area and a really good bookshop specialising in art and architecture and the buikding itself is a must-see. Best of all, wheelchair users and accompanists get in free, through the staff entrance, and thus avoid the queues. The website https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/Visite/S-informer-sur-l-accessibilite has plenty of information to help differently abled visitors."
5512,Friendly. Willing to help
5513,"Inside the main entrance to the Odeon it is very spacious and the doors to enter are automatic doors which makes access easier, the doors to exit at the other side are not automatic but other visitors hold the door open for me and I can go over to the automatic doors if I want to.

As I said the main entrance is spacious and the there is plenty of space to collect pre ordered tickets or queue to buy your tickets. The only thing I would say is after buying my tickets I always have to be careful reversing my powerchair as there isn’t much room when people are queuing behind you, I don’t want to run over anyone.

The only main problem I have at the Odeon is that it isn’t all on the one level, I have to use a lift to go up to the screens. I get anxious sometimes wherever I have to use a lift places in case there’s a fire or it breaks. I feel the lift at the Odeon can be a bit dodgy sometimes, the doors don’t always open when you get up and you have to press the button again. I have also heard it’s been broken occasionally, luckily, I’ve not been there when it has. The lift isn’t the most spacious one I’ve seen, but I have managed to fit in it in my powerchair and with 3 other people.

Upstairs is also very spacious and there are double doors leading to the screens at either side. I’ve noticed though there are new runners on the carpets which feel like mini speed bumps and means I can’t go fast, although maybe that’s a good thing.

There are two types of cinema screens in regard to accessible seating, there are screens where the accessible seating areas are right at the front and other screens have their accessible seating area are a few rows back. I don’t really like the fact that I have to sit near the front, although I love to go to the cinema too much not to go."
5514,we didn't  need assistance. Staff seemed friendly.
5515,"In this relaxed atmosphere is the ideal place to enjoy a meal with friends. Situated through an alleyway that leads to a small car park, there are 2 doorways. One leads to the bar, the other to the restaurant. In the restaurant, there are booths and long tables but the accommodating staff are happy to move things around for you. The only thing that let this venue down was the lack of red cork in the accessible toilet."
5516,"Theatre on the Lake and adjoining restaurant have disabled toilets but I have found them to be rather small, particularly in the Theatre. Signs are also small."
5517,"There is a cobbled court yard as you enter the palace, which was difficult, but inside there are slightly more even fag stones. You are given an audio guide and I was shown on a map a wheelchair accessible route. There was a lift and ramps where needed. A couple of wings (and an additional few rooms) were entirely inaccessible to wheelchair users and the main pathway in the gardens is gravelled. There were some videos, which didn't have subtitles. Although there are some seats that could be used in some rooms and plenty of benches in the garden, you would have to walk a while to reach them."
5518,We drove but there is a local regular bus service. Also the train runs from Glasgow central to Maybole where you can then get a taxi or bus 
5519,"The staff at the pub were very friendly and opened the restaurant with a ramp. Also , other wheelchair users will understand this glee, they had a great loo for wheelchair users!! Plus great food and Prosecco.!! A really nice venue."
5520,Staff were very helpful and attentive.
5521,There is a car park area to the back of the premises and disabled on street parking located at the front of the building.  The Venue is on a local bus route.
5522,"Top marks for the volunteer guides. Very helpful, friendly and informative."
5523,Staff are helplful
5524,"Friendly, happy to move tables to accommodate chair, no fuss."
5525,Helpful
5526,"There's at least 4 disabled parking bays between the two car parks opposite the Rumblin' Tum cafe.
The bus stop going both ways(towards Tarbert & the other heading towards Lochgilphead); heading towards Tarbert the bus stop is right infront of the car park and the other heading to Lochgilphead is almost opposite. I'm not sure on how often the buses run here as I did not use a bus to get there. "
5527,The Air Museum is wheelchair accessible throughout including wide single doors. There is an accessible toilet located in the toilet block. There is an onsite restaurant which is accessible also- serving some lovely food!!
5528,The main restaurant area is quite spacious the main doors in the restaurant are quite heavy and difficult to open without assistance 
5529,Easy to find from reception and restaurant
5530,"There’s a wheelchair accessible loo off the foyer, well signposted. There are grab rails on both sides of the toilet, with space for side transfer and an accessible washbasin. Unusually for a Dutch accessible loo (most have round the room horizontal alarm cords at skirting board height) this loo has two cords which come down from the ceiling and which ideally should be a bit longer. They are sensible positioned."
5531,"The Blenheim is a level 2 - 3 minute walk from Dawlish Railway Station. There is step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station. From the train station you can see The Blenheim, an imposing pink, Victorian house. and its an easy level walk to the accommodation.
Their website says ""There is metered parking along marine parade which is free from 6pm – 9am.  Blue Badge holders can park there free of charge 24hrs a day. Other parking include the Dawlish train station car park less than a 3 minute walk and free residential parking 5 minute walk away."""
5532,"There are 2 sets of toilets. One by the house and one at the Orangery Cafe.

I only used the ones at the cafe and there was not a designated disabled toilet only 2 normal ones with no grabs bars etc. "
5533,"There is a disabled toilet with hand rails and a good size to manoeuvre a standard sized wheelchair however there is no ""changing places"" toilet."
5534,Very big disabled toilet 
5535,"As mentioned in the main review the access is excellent . The only downsides I can see are the length of the ramp - not a problem for scooters/wheelchairs but could be a problem for people who can walk but with difficulty, and the heaviness of the doors which need a bit of height and a strong arm!"
5536,Accessible parking nearby
5537,There is a large disabled toilet on the ground floor which is opened  by a key on request. Additional male and female toilets are located upstairs.
5538,"The Pitt is a street-food market which usually happens on the last Saturday of the month and more often in summer. The vendors change each time, there is live music and it's free entry. The market is set up in a disused space surrounded by warehouses. The food is amazing! Given the small space and pop-up nature of this market, access isn't the best unfortunately. But, if you go at an earlier time (when it's much better anyway!) it's easier to get around."
5539,There is an accessible loo and it's easy to get to.
5540,The staff I met were very helpful and friendly. It was good to be able to discuss what facilities were available to help disabled guests.
5541,"There are no step-free stations nearby. Several bus routes will drop you off in the Strand, which is just a block away."
5542,Parking about 2 minutes from booking office then lift to information gallery and railway.Special carriage at the bottom for wheelchairs so absolutely fabulous views down the mountain . Easy access to viewing terrace and cafe which had lovely home baking and reasonably priced.
5543,Mixture of places with excellent access and those with impossible access
5544,Not enough disabled parking spaces. eg. none outside Boots
5545,Very accessible for wheelchair users. All grab rails in place to allow the user to feel safe and able to assist themselves to mobilise as well.
5546,The shop was very good for weelchair space. There weren't any lifts just stairs.
5547,"DSUK situated within Snow Factor, very friendly staff: couldn't be more accommodating of personal needs and requirements. To access the reception, take the lift up to level one and head for snow factor if you continue on in to Barvaria there is a lift on your right (the lift can fit a wheelchair and a +1). "
5548,There is a ramp from the back car park into the restaurant.  The car park is hardcore not Tarmac and so this is the only reason I have scored it a little lower. Double doors into the restaurant make easy wheelchair access. This is a nice stop for good typical home cooked pub food. Combine it with a walk at one of the nearby country parks.
5549,"A lovely natural country lane drive through 2000 acres of open garden views created by Capability Brown, and beautiful scenic views leads you towards the gracious Tudor house of Fawsley  Hall Hotel and Spa, (photo 1). A pleasant gated driveway (photo 2) takes you towards the Hotel, (photo 3). The disabled parking bays are at the rear of the hotel, some distance away from hotels entrance and only two bays available (photo 4), so if it is raining you are going to get very wet.
The entrance to hotel (photo 5) is very inviting, but there is a step to get up (photo 6) 
and although this is a reasonably low step, we could not manage it without my getting out of the chair, to allow my wife  to pick it up over the step. 
Once inside the hotel, we were greeted at reception and escorted into the pleasant courtyard lounge area, and a very comfortable and relaxing area (photo 7) 
to enjoy our brandy and coffee afternoon tipple (photo 8).  There is a nice little terrace courtyard to sit in, but rather a high step to get into it, (photo 9) so it was not suitable for a wheelchair, unless you can get out of your chair. The courtyard now leads towards the bar and restaurant, (photo 10) but a number of steps prevented us from using this entrance, so we made our way around on the level to pass the reception area, and down an easy little ramp into the Great Hall ( photo 11).
This was quite an attractive room, nicely furnished, but for us it didn’t have the wow factor. (photo 12). 
Now, along a level passageway (photo 13) it lead us to the elegant Cedar restaurant,
(Photo 14) and we noticed plenty of spaces we would be able to leave our wheelchair in to enjoy evening dinner.  Then you may exit the restaurant via a passageway (photo 15) that leads to the staircase for the bedrooms (photo 16) However, this is a listed building, so no lifts are available throughout the hotel, but we believe there are two bedrooms on the ground floor, but we do not know if these are for disabled use.
Not far from reception we found the disabled toilet (photo 17)  and although on the level to reach this area, it was almost impossible to get the Wheelchair into the toilet, so it had to be left outside on corridor. The toilet itself was quite impractical for a disabled person (photo 18) unless you can walk a few steps. 
We are afraid that you will have to miss the delightful Bar (photo 19) as there are to many steps to get up and we feel you may already be tired now having faced other steps, I know it wore myself out. 
Finally exiting the hotel, you have to get down that step, to return round to the car park (photo 20) on a level path, passing garden areas. 
Our final thoughts.
This gracious 5* Tudor house hotel is well worth visiting, if you have some mobility, but sadly, this is not a disabled friendly hotel, even though they have done their best, and we cannot recommend this hotel for the disabled."
5550,The are plenty of accessible toilets on both the ground and first floor of the museum with powered doors and automatic taps in addition to plenty of space for a wheelchair.
5551,Couldn't fault them. Lovely warm welcome from very attentive staff. Even when there's a queue the team works together to make sure everyone is dealt with quickly and efficiently.  There was a table of  8-10 ladies having lunch and within about 3 mins of them leaving the table was cleared and re-set ready to go. Very impressive team work!
5552,The garden centre has its own car park with several disabled car parking spaces available. 
5553,All the staff we met were very helpful and friendly.
5554,"We walked, but parking near by can be tricky as mostly residents parking styles.
There's a two minute walk from the nearest bus stop - Lothian buses 16, 22, 35, 36."
5555,"I was interested in going to Strathaven Hotel after hearing that it had been sold and refurbished. I was concerned that I would not recognise a place I had been going too since I was a child. I was pleasantly surprised to see the front entrance exterior was still the same. Inside is great. The refurbishment looks great. It is spacious with level access throughout the ground floor. There are 2 separate bars, a restaurant, versatile private rooms and a large function room. We went for dinner. It was lovely. It was rather quiet but there was still a nice atmosphere. There are plenty of parking spaces just outside the venue and there is a disabled toilet on the ground floor. I was told there are 6 bedrooms on the ground floor which are easily assessable for people who are disabled/have mobility issues. The bedrooms also come with a walk in shower."
5556,"We got the bus into Edinburgh from Glasgow, the Pleasance is a 20-25 minute walk from the bus station. I wouldn't say it was suitable for manual wheelchairs as the route has a lot of hills."
5557,"There is a wide automatic door into the museum and staff will be at the reception desk to your right when you enter. The museum is not the biggest so there are quite a few turns as you move your way through the exhibits, but it was easy to maneuver when I visited. There are plenty of artifacts to look at and the information is told in a variety of ways, with a mix of audio, information panels, videos and interactive elements, like the feel boxes in the replica trench area and dress-up costumes upstairs. There is a lift to access the upstairs area.
The museum does have food and drink available. The coffee shop inside the museum area was very crowded when we visited. We ended up having something to eat in the other cafe area which is accessible but did lack a bit of atmosphere and felt a bit detached from the museum."
5558,Nice clean accessible toilet
5559,The signage from the road to Hoe Grange was clear.  There was a level parking space beside the accommodation with a gentle gradient path up to the cabin.
5560,All the museums had excellent facilities for people with a wide range of impairments 
5561,"Very little signage, though due to the the plethora of staff, they were on hand to guide and direct. There are lifts and ramps throughout where needed."
5562,"Was clean and accessible, not specifically able to fit carer."
5563,"It is in the city centre so well catered for by public transport.
Nearest train station is Waverley, there are also buses. 

I didn't drive there, and it doesn't have its own car park. Disabled parking spaces can be found in the surrounding streets. "
5564,The cathedral is in a pedestrianised area but there are buses that stop nearby.
5565,"I asked a gardener for directions while I was in the park, he was friendly, patient and helpful. "
5566,"We had a disabled room and the bathroom has all that we need. The room itself (725) is really too small for a wheelchair but we managed. The hotel is good value, clean and well maintained."
5567,clear symbols and words are on the doors and signs doors are wide and automatic and the whole shop is wide and easy to navigate your way round. The gate to the library from the main shop may be too small for full wheelchair and the following path is also pretty thin.
5568,Staff friendly and helpful.
5569,Sidmouth doesn't have a train station but is do-able on public transport. There are step free buses from Exeter (9 or 9A) and the journey time is about 30 - 45 minutes. 
5570,There is adequate parking to the front of the property with a compacted stone/gravel drive way which is suitable for a wheelchair to move across. There is ample space for turning / reversing a large vehicle i.e. Volkswagen Caravels.
5571,I would have given 5 points except for the fact that there is not room inside just one of the cafes for a mob scooter.  Although in good weather you can sit outside.
5572,We drove to the Distillery from St Andrews and it was a fairly quick run. The distillery nestles deep in the estate and a long scenic drive meanders its way to the car park. Two prominent accessible parking bay signs depict the parking spaces. Only a 50 metre walk from there along the hard surfaces pathway and you are in the visitor centre. 
5573,"Pleasant handy little Spa club, not a lot to it, but quite popular with locals. It’s got all the basic equipment you need and it’s well maintained.

OUR REVIEW
Just alongside main entrance you will find a separate outside door signed for “Club motivation”  (photo 1) but you can also reach it by going into reception (photo 2) 
which will give you the chance to REGISTER YOUR CAR AT RECEPTION or face a possible fine if no parking ticket bought.
Just alongside desk you will see the door for leasure club, and it’s usually open, and all on the level (3) a short ride will take you to welcome desk (4) but again, pull handle doors need to be used, heavy and awkward, but then a rather steep ramp will get you down to pool level (5) after going round the bend (6) to get into pool area. It’s not very big, plain easy decorations, nothing outstanding but popular with locals, we find it well used. (7) and all the ladies in photo were willing to have their photo on internet.
Just close by is the Gym, but again, basic but modern equipment (8) and not a lot available, but well maintained and the whole area is nice and clean.
You may then return to your car and homeward journey (9).

OUR FINAL THOUGHTS
Not really ideal for disabled, not very easy to get to pool and gym, but will suit if you prefer small gym and spa.
We will not be recommending this spa for disabled."
5574,Good one on the ground floor.
5575,I don't know bout actual parking spaces for disabled drivers as would use a taxi as described above. It's maybe not the best to take a car to anyway as very busy. Taking a taxi gets round that problem.
5576,"Not fantastic access but if you can get over the small step on the way in, it's great once you're inside. Staff do their best to make for a great visit."
5577,"It was on the ground floor, with no steps, and a short distance to the clinic
The signage was minimal, however there was a reception desk who checked with everyone where they needed to go
Again seating is an issue, down to a policy of removing seating during Covid, so I took the precaution of using my walking frame with a seat
I didn't see alternative formats, however the reception staff were helpful and may be available
"
5578,"What was once an old potting shed is today a tearoom serving up incredible cake. The tearoom and garden are tucked away along a single track road surrounded by woodland and wildlife. There's step-free access, but it is a bit tight for space inside the tearoom."
5579,"The reception space feels open and spacious. There is always somewhere to sit with plenty of space for wheelchair users. 

The only downside seems to be the unreliable doors that provide access from outside into the main foyer, however renovation work is due to start soon to resolve this (which in itself will be very disruptive in the short term)."
5580,"There is an ""accessible"" toilet which is almost useless for wheelchair users. If you are lucky, you will find it open and the access code hand-written on a piece of paper stuck on the door. You will need to type the access code onto the security lock if you can. Inside it's cramped, far too little room to manoeuvre, not even enough room to wash a hamster. There is no emergency cord. This is completely useless! If you fall over you will not be able to summon assistance. It can be a life-and-death matter in the case of a fall and serious injury."
5581,Up 3 steps to get in. Good once inside. 
5582,The ticket agent and bus driver were both great. They were friendly and helpful. Driver explained how the wheelchair securement system worked and was happy to help activate it for me as I was unable to lift my arm up to push the button. 
5583,Staff are always friendly when approached and will assist when able.
5584,There is one entrance with a step and another closed door to the right which is level access. This is not always open however. My dad had to go inside to let them know we needed access which is a pain as I would not be able to enter totally independently. Once inside the access is good - level throughout and the accessible toilet is easy to get to. You can also order food and drink through an app.
5585,The front door requires someone's assistance to open and even then it is quite narrow without having both doors open. There is ramp access to the restaurant and bar but again the ramps are quite steep.
5586,Friendly and efficient.
5587,"The outside paths were solid and suitable for wheelchairs (I self-propel and needed no assistance). Similarly, I could manage the footbridges with no support. Inside the palace there was a lift to the upper floors and everything else was step free. There was an accessible loo with grap rails. "
5588,There are plenty of disabled parking spaces- some very close to the entrance. It would probably be possible to 'drop off' at the door.
5589,Very cheerful and helpful.
5590,All toilets are very clean
5591,elderly person with walking stick fell on highly polished wooden floor
5592,"This bar/restaurant is all on one level with friendly, helpful staff, great beers and great big windows for people-watching."
5593,"It is a small accessible toilet which is not helped by the fact that bins are located in the transfer area. On the plus side, the red cord hangs all the way to the ground."
5594,"Excellent lifts and ramps give access to all areas. 

I'm not 100% sure about the reliability of the lifts. I once got trapped on a mezzanine level for over an hour because a lift broke down after I got there and I wasn't able to leave. The staff were great, though, and offered me any refreshments I could imagine. So check out the lift situation before your visit, and hope for the best during your visit."
5595,"I purchased a disabled parking bay in advance which was posted out to me prior to my visit,the cost was £12.50 including postage which i thought was a bit on the expensive side but it was well worth i thought when i got there as the parking was only a 30 second walk to the entrance.I cannot really comment on public transport as i didn't use it but the venue is well served by public transport,but is quite along way from the train station."
5596,"Wow. It's taken a lot of work to get the BBC to listen in terms of venue accessiblity, I've had nightmares previous festivals and this is much more dreamlike! The gates have staff there to direct and advise. They were really clear about the need to check bags etc randomly but it was quick and painless. From the gate right up to the 'garden' it's ramped the whole way. This is a well worn path and care has been taken to put wooden plinths over the rockiest parts. It's all signposted and it's a lovely bright cheerful location. There's a bar and a catering point with cakes and coffees etc. There's a CBBC tent, a technology tent and even a DALEK. In the centre of it all there's bench seating and deckchairs with enough room to get wheelchairs and buggies around which is so often an afterthought. The disabled loo is a portaloo, they all are, and it's ramped to get up to the door, it swings outwards which is really hard to do if you're on your own or a carer is behind you but there is a security guard at the bottom of the ramp who warns you and tries to help. The external stage which I came to see UPMO at is covered by a plastic canopy, I could see the stage clearly even with professional photographers jumping around. Even the stage is ramped which is rare to see. UPMO are 9 members, with additional support and 2 of the band are wheelchair users. They also have members with learning difficulties so they need access as much as I or anyone else reading this does! The music was lively and everyone had smiles and the audience were clapping along. Unfortunately the performer in the Big Blue Tent ran over so their set was postponed and cut, which is never good for a band but clearly no thought was given to how anyone with additional support needs would cope with a delay of an hour. In my opinion there was no need for this delay and I'm sure Clive Anderson wouldn't have cared either. There were space heaters but even in August the wind was chilly and sitting for so long would not be on my list of wants given the choice! When leaving the event it's worth noting there's no parking along the main street and there's cones in place. The nearest bus stop was quite a distance but on arrival cars were allowed to drop off and then find somewhere else to park. Overall, given how poor I've found BBC access to be in previous years it's amazing to see the level of improvement especially in terms of staff and access...I'm looking forward to seeikng UPMO again soon as they are local and perform at accessible gigs frequently.

5597,Accessible toilets are in the main attractions including the House of an Art Lover and the Leisure Centre.
5598,Very pleasant friendly and helpful particularly the manager.
5599,"Visit the sunny holiday destination of Tenerife, and it's beautiful beaches.

Playa de Las Vistas, the main beach of Las Americas has a specific accessible area. This includes a beach/aqua-wheelchair, to enable more people to enjoy the opportunity of going for a swim in the sea.
"
5600,"Howard Park is a small town park with a children's play area, paddling pool and kiosk cafe in the centre of Letchworth. It underwent a facelift 3 years ago and is now wheelchair friendly. There is a car park with path and ramp access to the play area, a kiosk with a low counter, and then paths/ramps down to the paddling pool. The paddling pool has no 'edge' which means it's easily accessible by parents & children. There is a disabled toilet in the park too."
5601,"The small brewery has level access over a new tarmac drive. There is a level entrance through a wide door into the modern building. There is a wide corridor between the bar and production area, giving easy wheelchair access. 
The staff can ensure that there is wheelchair access to all relevant production areas."
5602,"The staff at The Storytelling Centre in Edinburgh were extremely welcoming and helpful on arrival, explaining everything we (a group of 9 adults with learning disabilities and 5 staff) needed to know and making sure   we had room to sit down while we waited. Some members of our group needed to use the lift and access was straightforward and eased further by the efficiency of The Storytelling centre staff. We were given seating right at the front of the theatre which really benefited the members of our group with visual impairment and with concentration difficulties.
The 30 minute show was also the perfect length for our group with a simple story, lovely puppets and a variety of sounds.
After the show we all had coffee in the Storytelling Centre Cafe and here again the staff were kind and helpful and moved around chairs and tables so we were able to sit together.  
Many many thankyous Edinburgh Storytelling Centre for making our visit so enjoyable and smooth! We recommend you most highly and will definitely be back next year!!"
5603,Staff were very helpful and friendly.
5604,The toilet was large and clean. It had an automatic light when you entered. It had a lever lock that you could operate with a closed fist. The only drawback about the toilet always the flush was on the wrong side.
5605,"Extremely easy to access due to the large ramp leading to the car park where where there are two sets of automatic doors.
There are multiple bus stops nearby. 
The store is a 15-20 minute walk to the main bus station.
"
5606,"I reported the Emergency Red Cord had bee severed in two places and the toilet seat had been vandalised to the Garden Centre staff. One week later I returned to the Garden Centre and on my visit to the disabled toilet neither the Emergency Red Cord or the toilet seat had bee repaired.

I approached a staff member who informed me that the Emergency Red Cord was lying on a shelf in the kitchen as no one was sure what the cord was for !!
I wrote to the Garden Centre and got a reply from the Assistant Manager who was so blasé and unsympathetic about the toilet I decided to write to head office asking for my complaint to be taken seriously.

I got a reply from the Garden Centre Manager at 21:40pm apologising unreservedly for the total breakdown in communication between his staff and Management at Kelso Garden Centre.
He also apologised for his Assistant Managers disgusting letter and informed me she was spoken to and admitted the reply to myself was not acceptable. 

He agreed with me as there had been an awareness issue as to what the red cord was for, he will be contacting the training department to arrange awareness training for all his staff.

I also asked why the cleaners did not pick up that the toilet seat was defective and the Emergency cord was missing, he informed me his cleaners have a check list that does include, toilet, Red Cord, Door Locks, Lights etc but yet again they had not done there job properly. 

The Manager informed me he had called all staff who were working the following day to come in an hour early so to have a team meeting reminding them of their responsibilities.

I thanked him for his honesty and his course of action as the Red Cord is vital to a disabled person who depends on the cord to summon for help in an emergency."
5607,"No help whatsoever, even the manager, who did not apologise and said ""*maybe* were wrong not to mention there's a small step"", completely downplaying how much of an accessfail a step is."
5608,Very handy for anyone already in the city centre or arriving at Waverley Station. You can get lots of busses from Princes Street. It might also be an option if you are travelling by tram. 
5609,Doors are wide enough for wheelchairs. Shower in the dairy suitable for wheelchairs. I could live there quite happily.
5610,There is on street parking or there is a car park around a 10 minute walk from the railway where you can park. On street parking was very busy but the car park was pretty empty - although I imagine in the summer it will fill up quickly.
5611,Really understanding helpful 
5612,"We have been twice to I Need a Holiday too.We had a lovely time both times,excellent accommodation,beautiful scenery and excellent hosts.Jackie,Carl and Max will do everything in their power to make your stay as comfortable as you wish. Would recommend it to anyone disabled or not."
5613,"All on one level with wide, step free entrance."
5614,"Undulation paving, forest type paths or compacted soil. Ramps have lips to get onto them in some areas. Swing doors or heavy doors to the indoor areas and lemur walk though (only open a few hours a day). Penguins have a walkway which does not allow a chair and pram to easily pass. Some enclosures difficult to see. Reptiles are 2-3 'shelves' high. Easy to see big cats, free flying birds, wolves, meerkats, penguins, some reptiles and red pandas from low height."
5615,I had no difficulty parking near to venue. There is a disabled bay across the road outside the entrance to the Botanic Gardens on Queen Margaret Drive and two bays outside the library on Byres Road a short distance away. However you have to bear in mind this was a Sunday evening in a very busy park of the city. 
5616,"All 4 lodges have huge wet-room. 
2/4 lodges have Clos-o-May toilets. 
All ground floor toilets are accessible- with one facilitating a left side transfer and the other a right side transfer. Grab rails around both the toilet and shower areas.  Ample space for carers to assist. Selection of S hower chairs and trolleys available for showering. "
5617,The car park is right outside the hotels doors and around the side. You can reserve a parking space to be closer to the main doors. There is a bus stop outside the hotel and across the road so very close.
5618,"I am writing with deep regret to complain about the very poor treatment we experienced on the 8th Feb at Prezzo Aberdeen, Union Square.

We have visited this establishment many times before and have always been greeted with smiles, accommodated, and been served some really good food.

Last night, this was not the case.

I’m paralysed from the neck down and confined to an electric wheelchair. On arrival, we were greeted immediately and taken to a table of four in the middle of the restaurant near the kitchen. As I cannot control my temperature due to my disability we always ask to be seated to the right hand side wall as it is more comfortable for us as the air conditioning in the middle area can make it quite cold.

The restaurant was not busy and there were tables in that area. The waiter then informed us that we were not permitted to sit in that area as I was a fire hazard. To our amazement we told the waiter that every time we have visited the restaurant before we have been seated in that area to which he repeated again we could not sit there as it would be a fire hazard (I can only presume he had decided we were a fire risk). We then reinforced our knowledge saying that we had been seated there before and the waiter then told us that that area was a “premium seating area which was popular and it was for tables of four only”………………..I was actually insulted at that point as I thought he was joking. I said you have just taken us to a table which seats four outwith the “premium seating area”. As we had highlighted this to him he then said you cannot sit there as the tables are booked. Three reasons within a space of about 5 minutes.

At that point I said that I was upset and we were leaving and the waiter said “ok then, goodbye”.

I am sorry but is this really is no way to treat a disabled customer (a regular) which I believe is down to very poor training and lack of knowledge on behalf of the waiter who has obviously never undertaken equality training or has any concept on appropriate language when dealing with people. To tell someone in a wheelchair that they are a fire hazard is not acceptable.

Life for anyone with a disability is extremely challenging, for many reasons, and this once again adds to the frustrations we face on a daily basis. All we wanted was a nice meal, a glass of wine and to be able to sit at a table, like everyone else “the priority people” and not feel out of place.

The waiter went immediately up to the supervisor to explain his position but I am sorry, his actions and his treatment cannot be excused on any level. We are equal to any visitor going to this restaurant, we work hard, we pay our taxes and the only thing that is different about us is the attitudes of others to what they believe makes us different.

If you do indeed have “premium seats” in your establishment and a policy criteria which identifies a wheelchair user as a fire hazard I would like sight of those documents.

I do not believe this to be the case and I am seeking feedback from the disability equalities forum and have taken to social media to find out if anyone else has experienced this treatment.

No one so far can believe that his has happened which is a testament to support my view that this should never have happened.
"
5619,"Please see photos. These were stylish, clean, well-sized and well equipped. Far superior to your average accessible loo."
5620,"The grounds were mostly accessible though over rough ground/grass for the most part,  the few buildings left were inaccessible due to low walls and stonework. Obviously the upper levels and tower were completely inaccessible. No audio guide but a few information panels dotted around - though sim of these were located in places I couldn't reach. There's considerable scope for improvement in access if English Heritage are minded. Dogs allowed on leads."
5621,Immediately outside
5622,"We went to Helmsley in the Car, sadly the tight wad Borough Council don't allow the less able visitors to park free (be warned !!) but you can park along the street as we did and walk along to the Main Square (we had a wheelchair with us)"
5623,"The University is not a campus University and there are lots of different buildings. It is just not possible to  give one rating to all the buildings and access varies. You should check the University's Access Guide at https://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/access/ and if you are a prospective student, you should contact the Disability Advisory Service at https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/welfare/disability?wssl=1. Work to make sites more accessible is always ongoing.

"
5624,"Sloped path between the room and hotel reception, but step free"
5625,"The staff here were very helpful and particular attentive in describing what there was to see, which way to head for, and the use of the audio guide. Very welcoming and friendly folk!"
5626,"Great. They let us park very close to an entrance which was close to our room. 

Public transport wise, the Gleneagles train station has great access since the Ryder Cup refurbishments. From there, the hotel staff will come and pick you up in a minibus."
5627,Disabled loos on ground floor.  clean
5628,The staff were friendly and happy to answer questions about accessibility. They did not seem to know about any ramp having been ordered as per the last review. 
5629,Long ramp to get into cinema which can be challenging if you are a lightweight and the wheelchair user is a heavyweight.  Once inside cinema there is a lift for the upstairs screens.  Downstairs screens are easy to access
5630,"There is no parking outside the cafe as it is in a pedestrianised shopping area but there are multiple disabled parking areas around Truro's main shopping area. There is also the multi-storey behind M & S so you have to come through the store and out onto Lemon Quay and Caffe Nero is just opposite.

The Bus Station is just a few steps away as well. "
5631,"We went to watch the World cup final here and had a really good experience. We reserved one of the larger tables which is near the entrance and had a great view of the TVs (there are so many there that you'd struggle not to find somewhere with a good view of the action).  When there aren't world cup crowds, there is lots of space to move around between tables and benches.  There is an accessible loo just to the left of the bar but we didnt use it.  "
5632,Ample.
5633,Excellent wheelchair access.
5634,"Across the road you can park at the St David's Centre which has a great changing places toilet. Plenty of parking spaces,  but you pay full place and its up three floors. There is often a long wait for the lifts. Don't go if you suffer from vertigo as you have to corkscrew round and round for ages to get to the first(3rd) parking floor."
5635,Disable access at Patisserie Valerie is not brilliant. As there are a lot of horse and chairs all around the shop with a few stares also is very difficult to get access to the disabled toilet. Also when opening the door someone has to open it for you as the door is not automatic.
5636,Everyone I spoke to was pleasant friendly and helpful. 
5637,Very helpful
5638,"Our tour guide Laura was lovely, she had been out the night before scouting the location and making sure that all the places she wanted to show us were accessible. She was friendly, funny and easy to chat to. She made sure that everyone in the group was comfortable with the pace and volume of the tour and ensured that we were all enjoying ourselves. I would recommend this tour wholeheartedly."
5639," We have been met by Kim each time, but all staff have been helpful and friendly."
5640,Disabled taxi drop off  means quite a walk to the terminal.
5641,"Great parking for blue badge holders, easy access, fully designed for disabled access everywhere."
5642,Pleasant and clean normal disabled toilet.  Ramped access to the café.
5643,"All staff we met were kind and friendly and did their best for us, no worries there at all."
5644,"I'm a wheelchair user, so finding places with character and charm to eat can be difficult. But tonight we've just had the perfect dining experience.
But we've had such a lovely evening at the Puffing Billy, that I can't recommend them enough. Welcoming with a great atmosphere, and all the food was delicious. Even my vegetarian girlfriend had enough choice, and great food.
They have a side and rear entrance that you can easily gain access, and staff will happily open these doors for you. And help at the rear as there is a edge on the ramp a wheelchair could have difficulty if it wasn't pointed out. Which they warned us about. Thanks guys.
Inside everything has level access, so you can access all areas. Some of the table configurations could be tricky, but if you let them know a member of the party has mobility issues, they'll bend over backwards to help.
The disabled loo is nicely equipped and clean. And there are two doors to get to the loo so nice and private for anybody worried about toilet noises.
The owner and staff at the Puffing Billy couldn't be more helpful. The right level of attentiveness, nothing was too much for them. And they were welcoming and friendly throughout the evening.
The place is the right level of character, and charm, but is totally functional. All the guest seemed to be having a great night too. And the acoustics within meant you could engage in conversation with ease.
I couldn't be happier with the meal we've had tonight. Thanks."
5645,"We stayed at the Kingsmills hotel for 2 nights for a special birthday. The room was well adapted for a wheelchair user, with a wet room and wide doorways. All areas were on the same level, including the lounge and private rooms booked for dinner. Food was good and staff were all friendly and helpful."
5646,"This being our 2nd visit ,the 1st time was ok , i have to say i couldn't wait to leave  this time... food took an eternity ... staff where unhelpfull and unapologetic for the poor service and even poorer quality of the  meal

We are both registered blind one of us is a wheelchair user  ...no menu in large print ...staff unhelpfull regarding telling what was on the menu
Access wasn't brilliant but passable "
5647,"All of the platforms are accessible, Platform 1 is their is a lift to access this, for 2 and 3 their is a ramp 

I would advice to book passenger assistance "
5648,"As someone with multiple disability, I so often find it impossible to meet all of my needs. If you want wheelchair assistance you need to be able to hear, if you want loop systems you cannot sit in wheelchair spaces, etc. This was a trip that managed to meet all my needs in one go. There is pretty limited parking in the area, if you go on nights that there are events on in other nearby venues you will struggle, but I was seeing an afternoon performance so we were able to park. In addition to the disabled bays, there are plenty of unrestricted double yellow lines. There is space for taxis to unload at the front of the theatre. 

The doors are very heavy indeed,  I was happy I had a free assistant ticket so I could bring someone, but if you were alone these might be really difficult. 

We went inside and collected our listening devices (Phonak Mylink at the time of writing, available with connection to T hearing aids or with headphones) and went into the lift down to the bar. This lift (wheelchair lift style rather than passenger lift style) is very snug indeed, you probably wouldn't get a wheelchair and a PA in together, but it is possible to press buttons from outside the lift and quickly run down the stairs to assist at the bottom. The door opens automatically at the bottom, but you come out between tables and are dependent on how widely guests have spread themselves as to how easily you can get through. Wheelchair lift is so snug you would up unable to get back behind the chair to push, so if it's a manual chair with a PA the PA would have to pull the chair out from the front. Bar is standard height only, no lowered bar area. 

It is entirely possible to get in the lift and then have your PA accidentally press the emergency stop button, locking you inside and unable to hear each other when you are trying to explain how to fix the problem! 

We went up to the theatre in the other lift which is a standard passenger lift and much larger, we got my big chair and 3 other people in there. Staff helped us get seated and checked the hearing devices were working. The signal was very good, no interference at all, and they play music through the system before the performance so you aren't left wondering until curtain up whether it's going to function. The caption screens were visible from the wheelchair seats and synchronisation with the show was about 98%, so I could follow the whole performance. 

Here comes the negative - the lift seems to be notoriously unreliable. At the start of the show we couldn't get it to come down and the staff said they'd sort it out because ""sometimes it..."" and then he left. I didn't think much of that until after the show when we got in and instead of going down it went up, then it opened the doors and refused to go down again. Well, if you are going to be stuck I suppose at least it gets stuck with the doors open. The staff are very well versed in what to do when it won't go, so it looks like this is a procedure they perform often. It did take about 20 minutes to sort out the problem and we got back out to the street in the end. The staff were so lovely that it really wasn't one of those days that you get angry about it, but you have to wonder if this is a lift you can rely on. 

For me this is a something of a Gold Standard trip (apart from the lift thing) because if they can provide excellent multi-disability access in a small, underfunded, listed building, those who provide less in modern surroundings while turning massive profits are lt with an even stronger spotlight of shame. "
5649,There are a couple of on-street disabled parking spaces around the corner but they are usually occupied. So I usually park on a different Street nearby and walk. Home is just off the high Street so it's a good central position.
5650,No disabled parking however you could get a bus into town and walk.
5651,Helpful.
5652,There is an accessible toilet with grab rails but no emergency cord. It is spacious and clean.
5653,Wheelchair accessible venue beautifully decorated with floral displays and quirky interior.
5654,"All on the same level.
Plenty of space and wide aisles.
Tables at different heights and levels to suit everyone - same with a mixture of types of chairs and seats.
Music wasn't to invasive and not too loud.
Wide one level into the shop."
5655,"Nice gallery, some interesting pieces of art. Reasonably accessible at ground level (there is an upper and lower floor but I didn't visit these today). Great staff. Dodgy disabled loos."
5656,"There is one Blue Badge space on a 'first come, first served' basis which was always taken when we were there. You can pre book a space for £5 per night which is in the same small car park so isn't any further away. Rear access from the car park with a ramp and an intercom for opening the door."
5657,Helpful staff who will advise on routes around the reserve although all are accessible.
5658,"Easily reached from Micklegate car park (£2 for 2hrs or £ 5,40 all day)
Abbey is short distance from bus and train station"
5659,"Very friendly, some were a bit OTT! They were well informed and styles differed from guide to guide."
5660,"Fairly easy to find.  Grab rails, clean and tidy.  However, the one upstairs in the secure area, adjacent to the Assistance Office was out of order. (nearby toilets if you could walk)"
5661,"Disabled parking outside the door worked well for us, even though we need space to make an exit from the passenger door. There is sufficient flat space to park but it is at the top of a steep bank.
You need a car to get to Hoe Grange."
5662,"Used to walk here, but the Lothian buses number 8, 27, 23 and 36 go past Cannonmills. "
5663,Loos were easy to find at the top station
5664,"Very nice authentic Italian food. Pre-theatre menu is very good and reasonably priced. There is about a one-inch step step to get into the restaurant. The entrance is rather narrow, but I managed in my large electric wheelchair. they had to remove seats for me to get into accessible toilet, but on the plus side they do have one, and it wasn't a problem for them."
5665,There were accessible toilets which were very well located.
5666,"Provision for disabled guests is poor with only one unsuitable room available in this large, upmarket hotel."
5667,Largely staffed by volunteers who were all friendly and helpful
5668,"Assess can be obtained by private transport/.There is a bus stop within reasonable walking distance to the site.
On site there are well maintained walkways,pathways and sitting area.Toilet facilities are good and door entry pads are provided
There is a mechanised ramp system to make mounting easier."
5669,"Expert, friendly staff at hand for information and advice at all times. "
5670,"There was a separate entrance for disabled visitors. Slope/ ramp access throughout most of the exhibitions. There were lifts to all levels. The Deep state that they provide a wide range of supportive tools and resources including wheelchairs, electric scooters, walking aids, audio and braille guides as well as a downloadable social story resource."
5671,Taxi drop-off right outside.
5672,This is the most accessible swimming pool i've ever visited catering for all abilities. The adapted changing room is huge & Well equipped. The pool itself is a full length Competition pool & it was lovely & warm. there was also a steam room which comfortably accommodated the shower chair. The staff were very friendly & helpful.
5673,"I enjoyed the tour round this beautiful Essex Wildlife Trust reserve, with its varied habitats. The highlight for me was the birdsong, especially the nightingales and the lambs you can see from the visitor centre were very cute!"
5674,"Dr. Martens, the iconic shoe brand, opened a store on Edinburgh's Princes Street in August 2013. I hobbled through the city with some friends yesterday and did not realise what the shop had done until I saw the changing room (see picture) - loads of space, hand rails to hold onto, collapsible chair. I checked the front door and indeed, there is a proper (tiled) ramp which is flush with the side walk! Awesome! The path to the changing room might be a bit narrow and accessibility is not advertised, so 4 stars rather than 5. Also, not all staff were aware that their changing room is accessible."
5675,"It was fantastic, I will be definitely do again. The staff are very friendly and great what they do"
5676,Run by volunteers but everyone I met was lovely and made no judgements. 
5677,Very helpful and pleasant.
5678,"Staff were superb. Friendly, helpful and went out of their way to assist."
5679,Paignton railway station is about 5 minutes walk away and has step free access. There are several buses that stop nearby. 
5680,"There is an accessible toilet in the Visitor Centre. A very spacious, clean and bright facility."
5681,"Good food, access not great for ladies, but staff lovely"
5682,"There are several accessible wet rooms available for people who need to use them.

There is also a separate room available with a mobile hoist and large changing bench available for those who need it.

They also have a working pool hoist. "
5683,"Friendly, Helpful, Thoughtful"
5684,"As a young Sheffield United fan I want to travel to away matches to back my team and Bolton Wanderers was the next trip! I am unfortunately confined to a wheelchair and away grounds can sometimes seem daunting experiences: where is the accessible parking, where are the seats, are they accessible, where are there disabled toilets etc.? Supporting your team is a great feeling (especially when you win) and with an understanding of the problems you might encounter, I want to share my experiences of football grounds with you so you can feel a bit more confident about stadium accessibility in the future. "
5685,Not specific parking 
5686,"The venue is fairly narrow which makes if quite tight when busy, but the staff will go out of their way to assist customers.  There is plenty of moveable furniture.  The doors at the entrance are quite difficult and require two people to hold them open if access is needed for a wheelchair user.   "
5687,The hotel is located right beside the A1 and about 5 minutes from the centre of Alnwick. Loads of space to park. Flat and easy access to the hotel.
5688,"We booked a wheelchair accessible room with adjoining room for a carer (as we have done in numerous other HIE hotels). However the rooms were separate, not adjoining. 

There was a significant  bump up from the room into the shower room, which took me a few attempts to conquer!

"
5689,"The staff were really friendly , pleasent and helpful"
5690,"A staff member showed me the way to the accessible loo because the old building can be a bit of a rabbit warren. It was modern, big and clean, with good rails and even some natural light from a high window."
5691,From Marina access was great. Did not drive or use local transport. 
5692,Stewards all very helpful and very aware of mobility issues
5693,The staff were excellent and got us on and off with minimal fuss.
5694,"ALL staff helpful, friendly and knowledgable.
I fully recommend a guide to help you to gain as much from your visit as possible
"
5695,"Whilst there was ample parking for disabled badge holders, there was no lines on the car park, which meant there was no guarantee of space being kept for the wheelchair on return. Whilst there were examples of cars parked rather close to other cars, fortunately for me my space was near the edge of the car park, however had I been further into the parking, I could envisage some major problems getting back into the car.

It was a long walk from the disabled parking to the main entrance as the full length of the parking had a physical barrier, therefore you'd have to leave the disabled parking, and then double back and walk the equivalent of the full length of the car park in the opposite direction to reach the entrance gates. So whilst a car can be parked as little as 40 metres from the entrance, you would have to walk 180 metres to get from there to the entrance.

The surface of the car park is compacted gravel, whilst the wheelchair went over this okay, it isn't the easiest of surfaces for wheelchairs."
5696,Very helpful and friendly.
5697,Wish they had tall seats that went over the toilets 
5698,The staff are friendly and approachable.
5699,"There is accessible parking bays at the rear entrance (off Bonnington road). There are only two spaces and are really quite tight to drive into due to the pillars holding up the ceiling of car park. The spaces are very close to the entrance and under cover, which is a real bonus."
5700,"Friendly staff, enthusiastic about the Countryside Mobility organisation that they belong to"
5701,Went shopping and easy access and parking but best of all refurbished disabled toilets.  COVID friendly toilet attendant on-site. 
5702,Staff were incredibly helpful and welcoming.
5703,"When you enter the car park the disabled spaces are on the left
However you have to park side on to a steep hill, so it's very difficult to open and hold the door not least because the spaces are small"
5704,"There were portaloos, including accessible ones. I didn't make use of these though, so cannot comment further!"
5705,Spotted this Pret and the ramp outside - hurrah! Great pit stop - spacious inside too.
5706,Parking was ok but we have a big van to fit all the wheelchairs in so since it was a indoor parking and it had a hight restriction we couldn't fit we had to wait a bit till a space came in the outdoor parking.
5707,Extremely helpful.
5708,A well deserved top marks as the even the glasshouse tour was wheelchair friendly with level access and powered doors all the way. A lovely walk through the rockery style garden with clearly signposted paths for wheelchair access. Time for refreshments at the John Hope Gateway where a lift or ramped walkway leads to the scrumptious afternoon tea!
5709,Staff are all extremely helpful and friendly 
5710,there are disabled parking spaces in front of the Sainsbury's store but after that you have to walk up a long slope or steps to reach the store.  My Dad was worn out before we got there from the distance and increased level of the store 
5711,"All level and spacious, no disabled toilet a drawback"
5712,All the staff were friendly and welcoming. 
5713,"I travelled by car from Dundee to Fife and was able to park my car right infront of our accommodation in a disabled blue badge space. Between everyone that was staying at Homelands with me for the weekend there were four cars, including my own. Not all parking spaces were taken when we arrived so we were able to find spaces for all cars, and I also noticed that the house next to us only had one car between everyone staying there so we were able to use cars further down the driveway. However, I feel if all houses had more than one or two cars between visitor then there might be some difficulties.

Due to not being from this area I am unsure about public transport, although there is information available on the Homeland website. There’s a bus stop 200mm from the entrance to the accommodation, list of certain buses are on the website. Markinch railway station is 8 miles away from Homelands and there are taxi services nearby, I think contact details were available in a book located in the livingroom of the house we stayed in."
5714,"Two heavy doors sit at the top of a small ramp,  this makes access very hard If you are on your own and a wheelchair user."
5715,My overall experience was so poor that I would not come to this venue again. From incorrect information on their website regarding the distance to the closest station to the reception and security staff and general attitude I would suggest you avoid it. 
5716,There are just about as many accessible parking bays here as there are general bays (still difficult to get parked on busy days though so pick your shopping times wisely).
5717,Always helpful. This restaurant is not as roomy as some of their branches but staff will find you an appropriate table.
5718,Level access throughout. Wooden floors so easy to move around. Wide corridors in shop.
5719,"Stanbrook never fails to absolutely fascinate us every time we visit, it’s review after review as we are so impressed by this delightful hotel. 
Of all hotels we have reviewed for our disabled friends this is a must, and we hope you will like Stanbrook as much as ourselves.

PLEASE READ ALL THE REVIEWS WE OFFER SO AS TO GET A REAL FEEL FOR HOTEL.

On this review we want to tell you about the fantastic cellar you can look at, and then enjoy a really nice lunch here, in lovely surroundings.
So where shall we begin ?

Pictures tell the stories, so let’s use these to tell you about our wine and dine delight.
It’s so easy to enter the hotel as two disabled bays are situated right outside by main entrance, ( photo 1) all on the level, with automatic doors, which by the way, we always find then opened for us, and you Immediately enter a delightful warm attractive reception area (photo 2) and over to the left a lift awaits you (photo 3) which is wide enough to get your chair in there quite comfortably (photo 4) Take the bottom button, not shown on this sign, for wine cellar, and a fascinating journey will begin for you.
A long old cellar invites you to explore, lots of room for wheelchair to move around (5) 
old barrels of my favourite aperitif pop Tio Pepe line the walls, as you stand in the tasting room, with a table calling you forward to sit and sip (photo 6) owhich you can do so on the evenings that they hold wine tasting events while you glance at their selection of bottles (7) that line the wall. Empty !   I wonder why ?
Heading on, more treats line the wall (8) as you reach the Green room and Games room (9) and what a pleasant surprise, it’s green ( 10)  with cosy leather chairs looking so comfortable (11). A quiet organised games room allows you to try out your skill on a few game tables (12) and a pool table is ready for you, go on, enjoy the game (13).
At the far end another lift will take you up to the ground floor, and back to reception desk.

We hope you enjoyed that little surprising visit to the cellars, but now it’s time to take lunch and a small sip or two at George’s Bar) (photo 14). Now, you can either sit here for lunch, or do as we do, go out of hotel at reception, and allow carer to take you down the ramp to the terraced area, and then across to the door to enter the lounge, a nuisance, but it’s worth it. (One day someone will sort out this disabled entry for us ) but as you enter this most delightfully decorated attractive lounge (15) you  will forgive their oversight at not thinking about us, and settle down to browse the menu (photo 16) We find it more comfortable on the settee and carefully spaced little tables (photo 17) and awaited our lunch to arrive. As we have had lunch here before, and always a treat, we decided to try out the fish and chips (photo 18) and we will be honest with you, they were the most enjoyable, well cooked and presented fish and chips we have probably ever had. The fish was done just right with a very crusty crumbly coating, the chips where crisp and the best tasting yet, the peas had that minty hint to them, and it seems the tartar sauce must have been hand made, a truly wonderful lunch (19) with an opportunity to get stuck in (20) in a very cosy, quite, beautiful lounge.


OUR FINAL THOUGHTS
If you like character, interested in wine, then you will find this a must. The cellars are most interesting, with other rooms that we have not mentioned here, as unable to put more photos on our review.
This is a hotel that every time you visit, you seem to find more to look at, and we would certainly recommend lunch here at this delightful historical hotel."
5720,"Excellent access. If you are on your own, I was told by the excellent member of staff at the Playhouse box office, a taxi driver would know exactly where to drop you off and from there, a member of box office staff would guide you to your seat. Couldn't get better than that!"
5721,Staff are very nice and always chat and make you feel very welcome.
5722,"Excellent in all areas. Knowledgable, upto speed and tuned into the problems faced by wheelchair users."
5723,"The ramp to the front door was manageable using my manual wheelchair. The front door was a little difficult to open, but the staff member came to assist me. The stairs have a banister which has black and yellow taping around it to make it visible for anyone with a visual impairment."
5724,Staff very professional and friendly. Highly recommend.
5725,"Next to all the public transport, this Morrison's Cafe is in a very handy place in Partick. 
You can enter the Cafe through its own doors, or from a door linking it from the main Morrison's supermarket."
5726,Wonderfully large wet room and toilet 
5727,"Sloped easy access from road with automatic doors. Level floors throughout. Lift to all floors. (There were problems with the lift lights when we visited which meant that we needed to be accompanied by a member of staff, but this was no trouble to them.) Plenty of space between exhibits for manoeuvring.  Plenty of space in cafe - though best to leave the scooter outside."
5728,They had a ramp and stairs into the building. Everything was accessible on one level apart from the raised seating area. There were however a lot of spaces for wheelchair users to sit closer to the front.
5729,"They need to be clean the toilets every day and they should be tidy at all the time and clean,"
5730,Helpful 
5731,"If you cannot climb into a bath to have a shower or if you cannot go up uneven steep stairs to access the only walk in shower, DO NOT stay at Steppes Farm Cottages  if you expect a shower.  Oh and if you do decide to go better keep some of the old one pounds to operate the electricity meter"
5732,Very friendly and welcoming.
5733,"With the nearby lift to the venue, access is simple."
5734,Could be much better.
5735,The bus is the transport - and it was great!
5736,"Bar staff and waiting staff excellent, especially our waiter Jack.
Front of house staff indifferent to problems with access, not interested in helping."
5737,There is a graded pathway up to the front door suitable for chairs and mobility aids and press button automatic doors
5738,"Five stars because it was completely different to what I had expected. Getting in was the first challenge as I wasn't sure where to go. My colleague spotted the way and I followed. Once inside a helpful steward offered an audio guide and explained how it worked, told us about getting around, and pointed me in the right direction."
5739,"Great disabled access automatic doors on entry, lifts to all floors, accessible rooms are large and very spacious and bathrooms fitted with full wet-room which is also very spacious. "
5740,There is the castle car park just next to museum with ample disabled parking spaces and it is possible to be driven to the door to be dropped off if the distance across the car park is too far to walk
5741,"Fantastic,great wheelchair access and loads of room. I could go everywhere which makes such a difference.
Folk very friendly,I cannot commend this place enough a must go to"
5742,"The museum is an old building as are most of these type of venues as a result there is a mixture of paving stones, Tarmac and cobles as you approach the doors. You will notice a large number of steps however the entrance is to the side of the steps and gives level access.
Once inside the museum there is lots of space and there are good size lifts that run between each of the 5 floors I also found that there was a good enough amount of space as I moved around each of the floors to see the exhibits on display all of these had cards displaying information about the item on show.
The lighting levels change depending on what is on show as some items need to have minimal light on them while others are shown in darker areas such as the Space items.
However all very well done    
   
"
5743,Staff are friendly and helpful.
5744,Supervisor and Manager were very positive and welcoming of my first stage review. I told them to keep an eye on Euan's guide. 
5745,"Riverside offer wheelchair accessible rooms and the resort has wide, smooth paths. The food court and main reception have electronic doors which are operated by pressing a button. There are many seats in the reception area where you can sit and have a rest. The alligator bayou pool has a pool lift so is accessible. The resort has many clear and concise signposts to help guests navigate around the resort. 

There are some areas in the resort however with steps, meaning that guests using wheelchairs do not have quick access to these locations and must alternatively take a longer route to get there."
5746,There are disabled toilets in the reception of the sports centre and in the swimming pool area. 
5747,"There are two entrances to this smallish restaurant, one had a nice gentle ramp, the other has level access - there isn't any specific signage - these are just the doors everyone uses"
5748,They were always happy to help and point the way if you weren't sure.
5749,We travelled by bus - the station is 3/4 mile away and the exit has a ramp and after that to the hotel is on the flat. Taxis are very cheap but there is no taxi rank outside the station so look up a number on the internet beforehand. Historic  Armagh sits on top of hills so you could get a taxi to take you up - after that it's flat. I wouldn't recommend the Roman Catholic cathedral - there is a path but it is quite steep going.
5750,Staff are very helpful and accommodating when they noticed that an error had been made with my booking.
5751,"Fully accessable hotel with gentle ramps, lift, wide room doors a d ourroom was amply big enough. Beds are a little low but comfortab"
5752,"as mentioned in other posts wheelchair access is good. i moved the hall table into spare room as looked nice but for us just in the way. As just the two of us also moved the extra seats and foot stools from kitchen/living room to allow extra space. There is ample room for powerchair in the kitchen/living room.  you can even reconfigure it (moveable kitchen island, etc.). very good access to fridge, kitchen cupboards, etc. for powerchair. 
Why the 4.5 stars not 5. we stayed in the opal room with the henderson lounge. We need the overhead hoist. we had the hospital bed and a single bed in the room. the opal room is very nice but not much in the way of storage space at all. restricted space also with second bed. the overhead hoist strip is quite short and runs from over the hospital bed to bathroom where it stops. There is a separate, unconnected, strip in the bathroom so you will need to lift into chair from bed, wheel into bathroom, then unhook and lift again into bath, and same on way out. A bit of a faff when wet. Also as the hoist trip is quite short when not in use it sits just outside bathroom door so tends to get in the way.  good shower. easy to clean up. did not use jacuzzi bath. tried the electric shower chair which was good."
5753,No great parking near by. The 1/34/35 bus stops right outside. Taxi rank is opposite on other side of Rd. Short walk to the canal. 
5754,There is a large car park with disabled parking near the entrance to the Gardens and also outside the Restaurant. Ramps to get into restaurant
5755,"We were able to park right near the house, as we'd requested this on the booking, but otherwise, you can unload the car on arrival right by the house, and then move the car to a car park within the grounds."
5756,Ramp to decking. Banister to hold on to. Space inside to manoeuvre.
5757,There are around 5 accessible spaces near the visitor centre. There are lots of other parking options dotted around the pond. Usually there is a charge for parking but this was not the case when we visited.
5758,"Part of the National Trust, Attingham Park is such a beautiful place that is wheelchair accessible. It has a changing places toilet and accessible pathways. We had a lovely day out!"
5759,Good wheelchair and dog friendly walk all round the centre so you can see most of the animals. Lovely outdoor eating/drinking area. Access to indoor cafe area too. Access to shop not so easy (not much room to move about).
5760,Tea room ladies very friendly and helpful. Lovely food at a good price.
5761,"This is a crowded station with clutter; poor layout; lighting and inconsistent signage because of different ownership. Access from car parks is level from Store St. but by lift from Fairfield. However, Store St. can be 10 minutes walk to platforms 13/14 even including the climbing, moving pavement. Crossing to Fairfield can be a challenge as black cabs wait for no-one and will drive at you.  

Access by free bus takes you to the old station concourse but note drop offs are on a busy slope.

There are 2 accessible toilets excluding those in bars or restaurants. See below for further toilet comments. 

There is a first class lounge for Virgin passengers but it is on the 1st floor and poor quality. The 1st floor can be accessed by lifts at either end but a narrow concourse in the middle makes it hard for chair users to pass without incident. A number of ground floor shops give no consideration to wheelchair use at all e.g. WHSmiths, Cards Galore. 

There is variable on platform seating but rarely near boarding points and concourse seating takes no account of disability at all. It’s all the same height and in small enough numbers to ensure that it’s dominated by people who would prefer a seat but don’t generally need one e.g. people who want to sit and chat or sit and read.

Live data is available but, as ever, is too high; too small and poorly located."
5762,"Staff had excellent understanding of my daughters needs. Gave her a special room in which we could eat as she could not cope in the restaurant. Staff spoke to my daughter directly, not via me. Member of staff had ASD himself and was particularly understanding. Duty manager came to check on us in our seats prior to performance to ask if everything was okay and we needed anything. We are given the same seats every time we go in order to keep things familiar and ""safe""."
5763,"There was good wheel chair access with ramped access into the pub from the front although no automatic doors.   

There are sections of the pub that are inaccessible to wheel chair users due to steps. 

On the whole the tables are at a good height for those with wheel chairs but it can get busy and access to them may not be possible during busy times. "
5764,Cutty Sark Station is on the DLR and is fully accessible (check beforehand whether the lift is working by using the Updownlondon website or app). It's quite a long uphill walk to the Royal Observatory.
5765,Walkied. Busy parking area.
5766,"If you are using a manual wheelchair, I would seriously think about hiring one of the mobility scooters, even through I thought that they were expensive.

Some of the paths were tarmacked, but on the whole they were gravely.

My wife pushed me for 82 miles in 10 days but this place almost had her beat. "
5767,"Good on-site parking, big enough to park and turn a minibus."
5768,"Our son has FragileX Syndrome, learning disabilities and epilepsy.

The Sandcastle is first truly accessible venue that we have found. A venue that doesn't think access just means a ramp & disabled loo.
 
The staff are a joy. They greet my son by name and he now hugs the brilliant Inclusion Manger Sue Copp whenever he sees her.

Highlights of the venue:

Full wheelchair access to all areas (you can even borrow wheelchairs that can go into the water)

Excellent disabled changing facilities with loo, showers, changing bed and hoist

No need to queue - disabled visitors can go straight to the desk

Wonderful Inclusion Manager called Sue Copp who really ""gets"" disability (especially learning disability)  and cannot do too much to help:- escorting us to changing rooms, finding seats for family near the pool, arranging payment on the way out, turning the music down...

Water Ambassadors offered to take T down the slides as I was there on my with him. Fab."
5769,Fabulous day out in country area - many birds . Good facilities - cafe open for outdoor eating and Tramper off road mobility scooters to hire
5770,Great - there is an accessible loo. But when I was there it was so stiff that I even couldn't close it! I said to staff and they just said it was new and it had been a problem but didn't seemed too bothered by it. 
5771,Great wheelchair access with friendly staff who are willing to help. Ramps leading to the centre with disabled parking outside. Accessible toilets and shower with easy use. They had sports chairs that can be accessed if you wanted to play wheelchair tennis. 
5772,Everywhere was easily accessible.
5773,"Staff were excellent, very friendly and welcoming. At the time of booking your theatre seats are not allocated. However I put an note on the booking asking for no or few steps and we were allocated seats in the back row. The whole set up is very well organised. A 2 course lunch or dinner is included in the price of your theatre tickets. There is a choice of 3 mains, including 1 vegetarian, plus there is vegetable side dishes which is self service and puddings are ordered at your table. When I went to the self service counter staff, seeing my crutch proactively offered assistance. Likewise in the bar, I asked if I could have help with carrying my drinks and they were very helpful. Likewise when we couldn't get a response from the taxi number we had for the journey home the box office supplied us with a number and offered to phone for the taxi.

UPDATED 2019:  Staff are always lovely and extremely helpful everytime we visit. When we arrived at the self service restaurant, a member of staff immediately asked if I needed help, it's always good to see staff around and being so proactive, it makes me feel able to ask for help easily if I had needed it. Again requested and was given seats in the back row, which is level entry from the restaurant."
5774,"When an attraction starts to talk about being immersive or inclusive you tend to be somewhat cynical as a visually impaired person. Visiting the Johnnie Walker Experience changed that view quite quickly! I could easily revisit, take my friends and may be have a dram or two ..."
5775,Staffs were very friendly and offered to help if needed. Staff are said to have done disability awareness and equality training
5776,Great walk with excellent views. There are ancient stones to see near the top and a hill fort (the latter needs a small detour over rough uneven grass).  Many benches at regular intervals for picnics etc.  there's an incline and a rough surface though so you will need a strong wheelchair or powered scooter.
5777,"The staff are very nice, but they do use the disabled loo"
5778,Step free access through the main doors from the pavement
5779,very friendly helpful staff
5780,Good disabled parking as close to the venue as possible.
5781,"Staff and volunteers so friendly and helpful. Lady at entrance explained map and gave us an access guide (it's also on their website).  In individual houses, staff offered even to move furniture to give me more room to manoeuvre. Top marks!"
5782,"Extremely helpful, escorted to meeting room with bags carried where needed"
5783,Disabled bays are needed by the main entrance. The main car park is rough and uneven.
5784,The staff we met were helpful and knowledgeable. Being very welcoming we would encourage potential guests to get in touch prior to booking to discuss their requirements as the hotel has a very positive attitude toward making everyone welcome.
5785,Designates parking bays near entrance
5786,"At the time of the visit, red cord tied up in one of the disabled loos and the downstairs disabled loo was the only one in use to all customers."
5787,There was an accessible toilet near the bar area.
5788,Big accès fail on the accessible toilet. A porta cabin style with a ramp running parallel to the front of the structure. Such as shame the security fence for the backstage entrance was impeding turning to get on the ramp. Not to mention the staff who had adopted the ramp as their viewpoint thus creating the effect of a queue.
5789,"Toilets are easily accessible *I've only checked female toilet. The cubicle is large and there is room to side transfer to the right of the toilet for left side transferring from chair.
However there are no grab rails so if you require them you might struggle. Toilet is all painted white with a light colour floor so colour contrast is not brilliant but it's a (usually) clean usable facility."
5790,"We realised at the last minute, that a show was on that we all wanted to see, ""Boycott and Aggers"", which without a loop / infra red system would have been pointless for me to attend, as I am a hearing aid wearer..
Our group consisted of me and my hearing dog, Harley, MY friend and his mobility impaired wife. Pat cannot sit with her left knee bent for any period of time. So imagine when I rang them the day before the show, if they could fit us in...
It was perfect, the Infra Red system was clear HURRAAHH...Pat was able to sit with her leg outstretched without any inconvenience to anyone, Harley got a free drink without us asking for one at half time, the staff couldn't do any more. WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK"
5791,"Superb toilet and shower facilities are provided in a full wet room accessed via a wide door from the bedroom. Drop down handrails are provided either side of the toilet with ample space for turning my wheelchair and transferring to the toilet, and also to the shower chair which was kindly provided."
5792,Staff are generally friendly and helpful and will offer assistance when needed.
5793,"Only 1 accessible bathroom due to narrow doors, need to be able to manoeuvre manual wheelchair to gain access"
5794,"Automatic door made things very easy. Slightly tight getting through to the back of the shop to the loo, but generally it was excellent."
5795,Staff were the minimum of politeness but not very welcoming. Particularly phased when asked to sit outside.
5796,The signage appeared clear and it was easy to find product.Being a DIY store I expected things to be difficult to negotiate and it wasn't. I saw an induction loop in operation.
5797,"This is a new cafe beside Roseland Caravan Park on Canada Hill in Rothesay.
It is fully accessible with very good toilet facilities.
It's easy to get around inside the cafe and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
The views are stunning across Rothesay Bay and the chocolate cake is delicious!  Table  service from attentive staff.
The best way to arrive is by car and there is good level parking."
5798,Staff are great & the food is a high standard but they have not thought about customers in wheelchairs.
5799,"Around 20 disabled parking spaces are available directly outside the entrance. At busy times the spaces will be full, so it may be necessary to park in an ordinary space. There is a drop off point at the entrance.

Buses do travel to the park but there will be a 10 minute walk from bus stop to park entrance."
5800,"The whole building is accessible.  There are two lifts both easy to operate and staff are on hand to help if needed.  There is ample, comfortable seating. "
5801,"Red emergency cord had 1 bangle, was too short, and looked cut."
5802,"Access is from the main road, I did not observe a ramp, no wheelchairs are provided, its not a large hotel, but very clean, friendly and organised."
5803,"Wide, automatic entrance doors, level and even flooring throughout and plenty of space in both shops and the corridor around the centre"
5804,I visited the hotel to attend an event. Access for me as a powerchair user was fairly good once I got in the building.
5805,5 stars if just using restaurant and toilets. 3 if you include the function area with its steps.
5806,"The toilet in my room didn’t have grab rails. There were also toilets in the basement, accessible via lift, which have no grab rail but are small so I could transfer using the door handle."
5807,"You access via side entrance via an alleyway leading to the canal. The staff then put a ramp down. 

The day we visited the side entrance was closed. My wife had to ask at the main entrance for someone to open the side door."
5808,Moira was incredibly helpful and kind throughout our visit. A very interesting lady who wrote a book about setting the place up! She kept in touch throughout our visit and was always very pleasant with us. 
5809,"Two lifts make this station fully wheelchair-accessible on all platforms. 

If you're a wheelchair user & you want to travel on South-West Trains services, or on London Overground services, speak to any member of staff and they will organise someone to help you with a ramp, or show you where to find someone to help.

If you're a wheelchair user & you want to travel on the District Line, you can board the brand new S-stock trains without a ramp. But BEWARE - the horizontal gap between train and platform varies greatly along the length of the platform. Move towards the front of the train until you find the smallest possible gap: there is an optimal area where it's easy to board the train. My picture below shows how, looking along the length of the train, the gap narrows as you get nearer to the front of the train.


"
5810,"If you phone ahead to the actual theatre, you can book one of their Disabled Parking spaces in their Courtyard.  It is difficult to park outside  because it is a main road but is easier at the end of an evening show.  There is parking in side streets however."
5811,Lots of disabled spaces but always well used. Large car park.
5812,Accessible loo available but not visited on this occasion.
5813,"Most of the city is accessible and wheelchair friendly. The streets and pavements are flat and wide. There are a number of hotels, parks, cafes and restaurants within the city that are wheelchair friendly. Tourist information has provided a pdf of places to stay and things to do in Mannheim that are accessible for wheelchair users:
http://www.tourist-mannheim.de/media/pdfs/Mit_dem_Rollstuhl_unterwegs_in_Mannheim.pdf"
5814,Super friendly and very helpful!!
5815,Easy Access for my carer who has to push my chair.
5816,"The staff in the restaurant in particular were all charming and happy to assist with anything they could from moving a chair out of the way to make room for a wheelchair, to carrying the tray over to the table. They went out of their way to make sure we had anything we needed and I was deeply grateful to them."
5817,"I was at the Centre for a week for a major event. I sometimes used two walking poles and sometimes used a scooter. I usually used the disabled toilet on the first floor which was very convenient. However, one day I popped in from outside just to use the toilet and used the main toilet on the ground floor. It was a busy day. There was a queue on the left hand side to the ladies toilets so I had to pass these on my scooter, coming to meet people coming from the gents/disabled/baby changing toilets. This was doable and didn't bother me. I parked my scooter outside the disabled toilet at the end of the corridor and went in. This was a well-equipped changing places toilet. When I came out, I found that the only way to turn around would be to poke the scooter's nose into the gents' toilet for a sort of 3 point turn. As far as I can see, the only alternative was to reverse the scooter along the busy, narrow corridor against the flow of men, disabled people and people with pushchairs. This was an extremely frustrating experience.  I was so cross that millions of pounds could be spent on an iconic building without paying due attention to the dignity of disabled people.  "
5818,There is an accessible disabled toilet. This is always clean and is completely flat entry.
5819,"Nearest place that any transport can get is the other side of the London Eye, about a 5 minute walk to where the boats leave from"
5820,The staff all seemed to be from Poland.  Very friendly and very helpful 
5821,"Accessible toilets were adequate. Enough space, although bins made it awkward to turn."
5822,Very friendly staff. Security stewards also endured no one wandered into our area to misuse the space that was allocated to disabled guests during the concert.
5823,"I used one of the toilets outside the viewing area though still in the arena. Plenty space in them and no problems at all for a powered chair. I would advise one thing, take your ticket with you!!! Schoolboy error, almost didn't get back in without my ticket!! :-D"
5824,"Wonderful old theatre who have tried very hard to make their venue accessible. This is better if you have a small manual chair as the access is so tight. There is a choice of very good seats, downstairs, with your party and the staff are all lovely!"
5825,Very hospitable for all.volunteered getting program during interval.
5826,"I booked a private tour and was offered the option of Arina, my guide, picking me up from my city centre hotel. "
5827,"In the centre of town, so good for public transport, but didn't see any disabled parking. There must be some around the city centre but we did not drive and wasn't immediately obvious where it would be. 

Very close to taxi stops and bus stops though. "
5828,This National Trust venue is accessessed by country lanes that were not too bumpy to make the journey more pleasant. On arrival the drive into the parking area is smooth and there are several accessible places to park near the entrance. We went for the autumn leaf colour as did thousands of others!! At peak ‘leaf’ time you may not be able to get in and signs will tell you to come another day. We did find parking next to the entrance and enjoyed a few hours admiring the lakes and tree colours. I had no difficulty in my powerchair - there are no barriers between the lake side and the grass so you do need to be experienced at controlling your chair or risk taking a lethal swim!! Hard paths with little shingle made for a worthwhile afternoon.
5829,We sat near a blind man who had been supplied with a headset so I assume that was for translation and audio description. He had his guide dog with him.
5830,Rose Street is largely pedestrianised with some through traffic. Lots of buses on neighbouring Princes Street and George Street. No parking that I know of at the venue. 
5831,"The front entrance has big automatic doors which allow for easy access. The lobby is clear of obstructions but is quite small. 

The Cinema is Lit well, the floor is even and slip-resistant. But the main reception is very noisy due to café in situ. This might cause problems with people with visual and audio impairments."
5832,"Fantastic, wanted to help, were aware but not overpowering. Made sure i was ok and everything was good for me."
5833,"The access was good, with ramps to the accessible area. My only issue is that the accessible areas are always at the back, where I would not necessarily want to sit as you feel removed, but this is a common theme with accessible platforms. If you can manage the stairs, they are wide and have about a 10cm drop and do to my balance I prefer these kinds of steps to narrow long steps. 

Below at the bottom there are extra toilets, with an accessible one, and I recommend sitting at the end of one of the rows of seats and going to these toilets if you want easy access."
5834,"Modern, spotlessly clean separate disabled toilet with assistance rails and emergency cord.

Toilets in shopping area."
5835,Great... When you could find it!! The biggest problem with the loo was that the door was plastered in Fringe posters and flyers making it very well camouflaged and hard to find.
5836,Very good for a wheelchair. Nice flat access and space to manoeuver. Mobile hoists may be hard work on the carpet.
5837,"Had afternoon tea in the first floor Georgian Tea room.

Three disabled parking spacious just outside the dome, although you need to negotiate a double kerb to reach the pavement. I had to go 75yds on the road to reach a lowered kerb for my electric wheelchair.

Outdoor lift is used to access the ground floor of the dome. A revolving door can be folded back in order to enter the building. The Georgian Tea room is accessible via a small lift.

I found the lift very small, with no ability to turn whilst in it. I had to reverse out, which was a little disconcerting since there are a flight of stairs directly opposite the lift.

Accessible toilet on the ground floor was relatively large. See photos."
5838,We went to Bannockburn not too sure what to expect and ended up having a really good morning here. The staff were very helpful and welcoming. There was lots of disabled parking and the exhibition and outside space was all very accessible. An added bonus was the cafe had lactose and gluten free options making a fantastic stop off point at the end! 
5839,"Friendly staff who are generally welcoming, polite and attentive."
5840,Very helpful
5841,Right next to the train station and near the bus station.
5842,Disabled toilet with grab rails and emergency chord.
5843,Flat entrance but if doors were closed i think you'd require assistance 
5844,Some of the best accessible toilets in town! There are several accessible toilets all with differing permutations of layout. All the features you would expect and spotlessly clean. A Changing Places toilet is also available; just ask a member of staff for directions.
5845,Best accessible bathroom I have ever stayed at. Great disabled toilets around the complex
5846,"The V and A is the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design. It has permanent and temporary exhibitions covering a wide range of themes from  architecture, furniture, fashion, photography, sculpture, painting, jewellery, Asian art and theatre. It also has regular events. It's housed in an old Victorian building which has been excellently adapted with lifts and ramps to create excellent step free access.
This review is of the Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up exhibition, which is located on the ground floor of the museum and is on until Sunday 4 November 2018."
5847,The access from main road is very reasonably easy from either entrance (Gorgie Road or McLeod Street)   Lift access available from McLeod Street up to the foyer area.
5848,"Forgans is a lovley restaurant in the heart of St Andrews. They serve good quality Scottish dishes. The restaurant is in market Street, slap bang in the middle of the town.
"
5849,There are three disabled parking spaces in front of the entrance at Granville street. There is also a bus stop nearby on Berkeley Street and Charing Cross train station across the bridge over the M8.  
5850,"We stayed on the campsite for a weekend and had the site to ourselves. It was our first family trip with three motorhomes. I'm a wheelchair user and my mum and dad both have mobility difficulties. We wanted somewhere with a variety of walks on site and plenty of space for the kids and dogs to play. We weren't disappointed and will definitely go back again. The country park itself is great for access. The campsite is basic and when we went, facilities were shut due to Covid. The field is sloping and on grass. It was hard going in my mountain trike. Would be really difficult in a manual chair. My mum managed with a stick but had to be careful as the grass is very uneven and was quite long in places.

Go Ape is on site... quite pricy but great for the kids! There is also a decent play area with enough to keep even older kids entertained for a while. 

We did the accessible woodland walk, which was pleasant but short. I suspect in summer it will be overgrown though and not so nice. We also took a longer walk along one of the main paths. It was flat, smooth and easy. My mum alternated between walking and being pushed in a transit chair and she was happy and relaxed, enjoying being out with the family again."
5851,"No parking as such but plenty of space for loading (as with us, and our minibus) and drop off zones (for taxis)."
5852,Lots of room to turn.. All rails in place. Red cord fine. The only toilet I have seen with their own prominent red cord sign. 
5853,"A real depth of paintings from recent to medieval. Some  famous ones like When Did You Last See Your Father.  A few Lowerys and Epsteins.  
Venue easily accessed via a ramp. Cafe in foyer, and accessible toilet and a lift to first floor. "
5854,Good parking but the disabled spots are at the back of the building and that feels really horrible.
5855,"We drove to the centre, and there were lots of accessible parking bays right by the main entrance to Soar. There is a bit of a walk from the main entrance through to the Snow Factor however."
5856,"Signage was great.  paths in park very flat and easily accessible.  disabled access in museum was excellent and some thought had been given to how the museum flows for disabled visitors who have to use the lift to get access to the higher floors.  Even the street part has a mix of cobbles and large paving slabs.  We usually have problems with cobbles as anyone who is in a chair can probably relate to, but we were able to stay on the larger bits which meant impact was minimal and we were all able to enjoy the experience."
5857,"There is level access to the hotel, altho' there is a small step up into the restaurant. Seating is on two levels, with a ramp to the higher level. "
5858,Dedicated blue badge parking bays are situated close to the main entrance. Arriving by accessible taxi I was dropped off at the Taxi point which was a short distance from the main entrance. There's also a bus service from the city centre to Riverside and the city sightseeing bus also stops there.
5859,Park next to accommodation. 
5860,"BIG effort for accessibility for all - just a little more thought or training required, I feel. Also, the tables are bolted to the floor so there isn't a lot of room for wheelchairs, scooters etc."
5861,Quick and easy to board when we asked for a ramp. Good service.
5862,"It's a usual premier Inn with a decent bar and restaurant inside. External access good, internal access good, all rooms have showers, no baths, and the shower is in a semi-enclosed cabinet, which means reasonably easy to access, may be harder with bigger wheelchairs. Staff, food and drink all great.
Unrelated to hotel but worth mentioning - getting a wheelchair accessible taxi in Dublin is best booked in advance as they're in short supply and the heavy traffic means they may take a while to arrive."
5863,Tiny step but easily cleared by my wheelchair 
5864,"The front entrance is flat, the exterior doors both need to be opened for a wheelchair user to access, and the interior doors are wide enough for one to be opened, both are glass, which staff are quick to assist with.  It would be advisable to book, as there are limited seats/tables that would be easily accessed by wheelchair users.  The bar area has the high tables/stools which are not accessible (a trend that I don't like)."
5865,"Plenty of space, with rails beside the toilet and accessible washbasin."
5866,There is a large accessible toilet but getting to it and back to your seat is difficult.
5867,Loos accessible through bedrooms  - the property we stayed in is very small but space used well.
5868,"Friendly, helpful, disability aware . Nothing was too much trouble. The garden tour was very informative ."
5869,"Wide electronic doors allowing access to the toilets are manually operated by a large button placed just below waist height, allowing easy reach for wheelchair users."
5870,Southwark Station (Jubilee Line) is just over the road and is step-free.
5871,"The car park is situated immediately outside the Maltings entrance. There are 44 spaces, 8 of which are for the use of disabled badge holders. The car park is situated within easy access of the town's main street."
5872,"Treadwell's is an esoteric bookshop, which sells new and rare books and ritual supplies. It also hosts tarot readings and other events, some of which since the pandemic have gone online. This is a small, welcoming bookshop with friendly and knowledgeable staff. It has its own unique ambiance and is a very special space. The main bookshop floor is very accessible."
5873,I met up with some friends for coffee at the lounge bar of the DoubleTree Hilton hotel in Edinburgh city centre. This venue has the Neatebox app Welcome installed so I was able to let them know in advance that I was coming and what assistance requirements I need. As soon as I arrived I was greeted at the entrance by Ricardo who guided me through to the lounge bar where I met up with friends for a coffee and blether. 
5874,"Online, this hotel looked just what we wanted - centre of the old town, car parking,  restaurant attached and an accessible room.  I did phone and check about the bathroom, and was assured that a seat would be provided in the shower.  
I must say ""OLD TOWN"" should have set alarm bells ringing.  The hotel is in a lovely OLD building (you guessed it - a Court House).  It is a listed building, and very difficult to make disabled friendly.  They have tried - but, unfortunately, failed.  The hotel parking is about 20 abled-bodied minutes walk away, accessed via a myriad of tiny, one way streets.  My able-bodied husband dropped me and the luggage off, then had to go and park the car - took nearly an hour.  
I burst out crying when we reached the room (there was a lift to all the floors).  The room was originally on at least three levels with steps between.  So, to make it accessible, they had introduced narrow ramps, which of necessity were short and therefore quite steep.  I could not propel myself into the room in my wheelchair.  The room itself was very cramped - once I, my husband, the wheelchair and mobility scooter were in, there was almost no room to move.
The bathroom was even more cramped, made worse by being divided into 3 parts.  The seat for the shower was completely inappropriate (I think they understood I just wanted to sit down - not shower on it!).  There was only one shaky grab rail by the toilet.  I could not go wheel into the bathroom by myself, as it involved negotiating 2 ramps, and no turning circle.  On the plus side, there was an emergency cord strung right around the whole bathroom, just above floor level.
The ramps were a big mistake - they would have been better off leaving the steps, although then not wheelchair accessible (not that it was with the ramps).  My husband tripped off the side of one - so bad even for the able-bodied.
We couldn't stay there for longer than one night (had originally booked for 3).  The staff were really apologetic - and almost as upset as we were.  It had not occurred to them how unfriendly the room was to a disabled person.  
The next day they phoned around to find us a new, more appropriate hotel, gave us a bottle of wine to say sorry, and did not charge us for the next two booked nights.
Throughout, the staff were amazing, and I am sure the hotel would be great for able-bodied clients - just not for physically disabled guests.  I did suggest that they change their website and stop advertising an accessible room, as there was no way they could really make it better, given the restrictions imposed by the building's structure and historical importance.
The attached restaurant is wonderful
"
5875,We walked here but there are bus stops nearby. The Brighton and Hove buses have lots of accessible features which make them a good option for getting around the area.
5876,Holyrood Distillery has just very recently opened and is fully accessible. Accessible shop on the ground floor and an accessible lift to all floors of the gin and whisky distillery. They also have induction loops available for hearing impaired visitors and an on site wheelchair in case anyone with mobility issues needs to use it 
5877,All areas on the level. Toilet was up a small slope and the only comment was the placing of one nearby table but the people seated there happily moved out of the way. It is a busy bar so slight care with manoeuvres but was bright and well lit (our visit was in the afternoon). Main doors wide enough to get standard wheelchair through a single door but assistance required in the way in as the door opened out the way.
5878,Many of the rides aren't accessible for a wheelchair unless you have a level of mobility but around the park is wonderful.
5879,"Very helpful at all times
Offer help but never patronising
"
5880,"Outside stadium there are toilets however can be uncomfortable as they are located very close to the male toilets entrance so a women can be very uncomfortable - i am not sure if there was any near ladies entrance but the ones i can across was near the mens 
inside however there was 2 near my entrance however they was a little walk from the turn stiles entrance "
5881,"Brentford Gate is the entrance with the disabled parking. The parking is a mess; some spaces are only suitable for ambulant. With regard to WAVs, prepare to be disappointed. The parking spaces have not kept pace."
5882,"Big, roomy, clean and easy to get to."
5883,Bus and rail station less than 5 minutes walk away. There is on street parking.
5884,"There are accessible toilets situated throughout the venue, including near to the entrance to each of the accessible viewing areas. These are of variable size and design, and include at least one with a hoist."
5885,Very friendly staff. They were in obtrusive but there each weekday if you had questions.
5886,Never realised this place was here! Great balcony and a good sized restaurant. Blue badge parking right outside. Ramp access with a lift to take you to the restaurant on the first floor. And great food!!
5887,"There are parking spaces down side streets, having a blue badge means you don't pay, i would suggest going on google street view before going."
5888,"*Shudder*. First of all, the good news: it's easy to get a parking place on the day in the allocated field for blue badge holders across the road from the venue, and they had laid down a plastic walkway this year to help you get from your car up to the road without having to cross too much grass or other uneven surfaces. The problem is getting there: the trains and tube in London are 90% useless for wheelchair-users, so we have to endure a long, hot, slow drive through cramped residential roads to get to the Wimbledon tennis from where we live in the north of the city. It's a good job it's a fun day out when you get there, because this has almost put us off going again."
5889,Super helpful and enthusiastic! Restaurant staff who brought food to table seemed genuinely happy & smiley. We didn't need any particular assistance but all the staff we encountered were great.
5890,"Only a few cobbles into the grounds, otherwise flat and smooth terrain. You go up a lift onto the wall to look out. You can see from a low height through the wall opening. Inside the walls you can look around the prison (lift to all floors) and balcony view of the chapel. A lift and low light to easily see the Magna Carta underground. At busy times going around the prison may be a squash. Virtually empty on the Saturday we went. The light in the prison is bright and floors smooth."
5891,Fully accessible disabled loos
5892,"The centre is some 400m from the tube station (Kings Cross/St Pancras) where there are lifts to the surface from all the lines (though you are dependent on up to three lifts being operational to get to and from the trains). Note that the station is big, with up to 400m to walk from train to street level. 
Blue Badge parking is possible in Crinan Street, including the ‘residents only’ spaces. However, it's a somewhat chancy business, as there may not be any spaces available. There’s an NCP at St Pancras International station.
A number of bus routes run nearby."
5893,Car park quite small. Several blue badge bays.
5894,Small step at front door but owner always ready to help.
5895,Warm and friendly. Reception asked about any access needs as a matter of course.
5896,Some  on street parking in the adjacent roads. Buses also run along some of the nearby streets.
5897,"The access to the building was around the side, down a cobbled street. You gain access through ringing the door bell which was answered quickly by the staff. "
5898,There's a car park at the back of the hotel. 
5899,There were plenty of transport facilities. 
5900,"I didn't have high expectations of the loos in such a busy place, but I was pleasantly surprised. As I approached, there was a queue for the ladies' toilets right out the door, but a steward sprang forward, ushered me and my scooter past the line of waiting people and unlocked the door to my very own large, clean accessible loo. Just one downside: the light inside was on an energy-saving motion sensor and kept deciding to turn itself off because my movement wasn't lively enough to let it know I was still there. "
5901,Accessible Toilets are available but I haven’t needed to use them on any of my visits. 
5902,"Entry is easy and all on the level, and you can get into each section of the spa."
5903,"Accessible loo was well signed. Fully equipped, but not large enough to enable the mobility scooter to be turned. Grab rails provided but the toilet itself was ‘normal’ height."
5904,"Friendly, helpful and proactive."
5905,"Three stars lost here for an otherwise *excellent* accessible toilet, because the staff often store big boxes and packing cases in the accessible toilet, not realising that the space in such a toilet is *not* spare, but is needed for wheelchair manoeuvring. Sometimes you can't even get inside the toilet because of all the stuff they store inside, right by the door! This is really terrible. And the accessible toilet door opens outwards onto another busy door, leading to frequent door-crashes."
5906,No parking of its own but lots of nearby street parking and town car park at too of the road however I wouldn't recommend using that as the ground is very uneven.
5907,"Friendly and helpful, including the speed and tone of response to my Facebook enquiry about the seating in particular screens."
5908,Great access through out.
5909,"Loix village centre is flat and there is not too much traffic on the road. There is a central square with shady trees and benches. On the square is Eglise Sainte Catherine, the parish church, which has 1 step at the entrance. Next to the church is a café, La Route du Sel, with indoor and outdoor seating. I think there may have been a step from the courtyard to the indoor part of the restaurant. 
The tourist information has a step at it's entrance.
On the outskirts was he salt fields and a salt museum. The bus drove passed the museum but did not stop and it was too long a distance to walk, with a crutch, especially as the route was along a cycle path and not where to stop and rest en route."
5910,"I took my oldest daughter as my carer. When we were trying to find the venue we found staff wandering around the local area promoting (Underbelly staff wear purple tshirts, the venues have purple entrances) so we asked for directions. The staff from that point on were attentive and knew what they were talking about which is always a plus. Once we got to the door we needed, (which were signposted with names of cows) I saw stairs and my heart sank. 2 members of staff saw us and told us that the access ramp was round the corner, it's actually a solid concrete slope rather than a mobility ramp and even that reassured me that access has been considered. The member of staff who escorted us to our seats took us through the door and round the back of the stage, it's pretty dark but the access is clear and the staff member led the way. When we got into the actual room they'd already worked out where to seat us so there was no fuss or panic. We were about 5 rows back and to be honest as the show started I was glas we were not closer to the stage as the action takes place on a screen suspended from the ceiling. My manual chair reclines but I didn't think about that and not everyone has that function. 
When the performance started there were 4 people centre stage, a lady to one side on a computer and a 3 piece band on the other side of the stage. I had no idea what to expect and that's part of the Festival experience. Manual Cinema come from Chicago and at the end they took time to meet the audience and answer questions about their 'craft'. That's not something all performers do, but it's something I appreciate, I usually have questions and can't get answers. They actually didn't design the show with disabled awareness in mind, but it works. The screen being higher than heads means I could see everything without stretching or craning my neck. I didn't need to ask the people in front of me to move to accomodate me.  
The stage is visible and the performers move around which adds something to 'just' the puppet type shadow work on the screen above, I was watching the 4 operators put the screen overlays on the overhead projectors to create the scenes and the people acting at the same time and then could see it all come together on the screen above. Very subtle and really effective. The lady operating the computer for lighting and effects sang too and her voice was lovely. 
The musicians added drama and tempo nicely which is also great to watch. I saw Lula Del Ray which was a touching story about a girl's dreams and her relationship with her mum, her imagination and music. I like pieces which encourage thinking or self exploration so the style used was really effective for this. Puppetry is often seen as for kids, or passe, but there was something contemporary and fresh about their approach. 
When the show was over again staff were efficient and helpful to make sure we were looked after, and the Venue Manager asked if everything had been what we'd expected as we left. To that point it all was. 
Unfortunately, when I went to use the toilet after the show I found an area for improvement, the accessible toilet is small, I struggled to turn my manual chair to get in and out, on the way out the door and my chair had a fight 4 times before I was clear to get out. There is another toilet with a disabled sign, but it's a gents and there's no disabled toilets or adaptions to help. I did point this out to staff who were apologetic but not sure what solutions could be offered. The additional toilets in the quad outside have steps, they are portacabin style ones so I think there's potential to put an accessible one there. I'd be really concerned about taking a power chair or larger manual in to that toilet (mine is a 30"") but I was unable to find an alternative. "
5911,"Excellent disabled access, with automatic main doors. No steps or ramps. Lift to 1st floor cafe & plenty of space for a wheelchair, which are also available for customer use. Low level checkouts good for wheelchair users."
5912,"Visiting for the first time this year, Edinburgh's International Book Festival manages to raise the bar once again on accessibility. Last year I thought it was fabulous with a Changing Places Toilet and Multi Sensory Story Telling. This year there's a new drop off point with ramp to get you safely up on to the pavement without having to do battle with the whizzing traffic trying to move you on. Add that to the mix of more boardwalk space, more inclusive performances, colourful ramps to everywhere and a calm oasis of peace amidst the hustle and bustle of town you have a hit!"
5913,"Signage is a bit small, but for wheelchair access with no additional needs, it's quite good. There are signed performances and audio described performances available, and assistance dogs are welcome but I've not experienced these myself. The website says infrared hearing necklaces are available on request. "
5914,"All too eager to help and really friendly and kind. Extremely knowledgeable too, which is always an added bonus! "
5915,"Great cafe in The Lake District. Wonderful food and a nice arty gift shop, with accessible toilet. "
5916,"Excellent, asked if were wanting anything specific, offer to take us to the lift and the curtain area, offered me the a touch, sensory feel of the fabric and texture - though she who must be obeyed said ‘ that’s what your buying ‘ , so decision made. The staff were fantastic can’t fault them."
5917,Phil and his wife are on hand for all your needs. very helpful and friendly
5918,"Overall the venue was good. Nice and bright, which helps me as I'm visually impaired, and the staff were very supportive when it came to giving me assistance. I couldn't see any blue badge parking nearby though, although there was a drop-off right outside, and a fellow attendee who is also a wheelchair user commented that the parking was 'quite a bit away'. "
5919,"There was a housekeeper at the end of the phone line but we had no reason to contact the lady, and she had the house  clean and tidy for us arriving, also they were some essentials in the house,"
5920,Wet room was en suite with the usual grab bars
5921,Every staff member that I interacted with was very friendly and the person I contacted about the accessibility on Facebook was very friendly. They remembered me contacting them when I arrived and helped me inside.
5922,"I arrived under my own steam, or should I say power, using my powerchair. There is Blue Badge parking in St. Clair Street and a separate area for HDSA members as well as away fans. You can get more information on the HDSA website at www.hdsa.org.uk"
5923,Only a few disabled parking spots but there are some outside the museum and space is tight in Oxford. They have done what they can. The museum is accessible.
5924,"Difficult place to find as sat NAV cannot always find it, it seems to be in a dead spot, so follow our easy guide to get you there, as you can read it on main review page.
There are three disabled bays for parking, but anywhere will be ok.  It’s a bit of an effort to get around car park, as uphill and over rough areas, and main route for walking can also be hard work."
5925,There is a car park on the public road through the park with parking for the disabled. The car park is right next to the Serpentine and there is a great drink and snack kiosk a few yards away
5926,"Gamla Stan has it's own metro stop, which is step free with lifts. There are several buses, trams and even ferry boats that stop close by."
5927,"The hotel entrance is situated on Meuse Lane opposite McDonald's. By foot, turn onto South St Andrew Street and turn left into Meuse Lane, the hotel is 20m on the right. Parking was quite hard to find as there are no directions but parking is available at the nearby Q-Park car park, Greenside Row, EH1 3AN, Edinburgh"
5928,"Four star hotel visit, BUT NOT DISABLED FRIENDLY.
A old 14th century Manor, and this pleasant pub was originally a farm house, at its present spot. During the 16th century it was a T shaped Manor, of timber construction, and then later on, in the 18th century, the Hall of the Manorvwas replaced by brickwork, which now form part of the Eastern section. During the 1870’s a lot of rebuilding work took part here..
It has been owned by the Lewis family since 1950’s, in 1988 it was converted into a village pub and restaurant, and then again upgraded in 1997 into a 21 bedroom luxury hotel, then following a fire in January 1999 it was refurbished, and still set off by medieval architecture, with 33 attractive bedrooms, a two AA rosette restaurant, log fire in bar, which has all helped to make this a very popular wedding venue, as well as day trip excellent visits.

If you leave the hotels reception area, and take the ramp and lovely pathway (photo 1) make your way uphill on the driveway towards the old pub itself (2) but take the entrance on the rough pathway (3) towards sign for toilets. Push the hard and heavy door at the end of a passage (4) and enter the bar area (5) and move inside (6) into the main bar area seating (7) and move into the larger seating area (8).
The lovely looking interior (9) will lead you up to the restaurant, but you have no choice but to make it up three steps to enter the restaurant itself. (10)
A delightful glass roofed conservatory awaits (11) with an excellent deco and comfortable chairs (12) with views over a well kept stretch of the canalside (13)
Come back down again and enter the bar area heading for the cosy corner by the roaring fireplace, well it will be during winter months (14) and join my husband for a pot of tea, or as in my case, a nice glass of red Merlot. (15)."
5929,"Booked in advance and were given a table with a fantastic view over the Golf Course and the sea. The service was excellent as was the food .. Tiger prawns in Tempura batter followed by crushed meringues with cream and fresh local strawberries, After paying the bill my carer was asked if she wanted help with pushing the wheelchair up a slight incline to the reception area. Although there are no blue badge spaces we were told we could park right beside the front door in future. A member of restaurant staff offered to stay with me while my carer retrieved the car from the car park, that is what i call service. "
5930,High step at front door but staff rushed to help me lift the scooter inside. Lots of room to move about inside and everything is on one level.
5931,Beautician in local hospital close to city centre.
5932,the view sitting outside by the river
5933,"All was accessible and easy but the overwhelming thing was the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff. I had an accessible room on the ground floor and needed some help with luggage etc. No problem for the staff!
Cleethorpes also accessible in the main. Good attitude of shop staff! Good fish and chips - I'll be back!"
5934,Not overly helpful or chatty. Very unlike other local NTS
5935,Very helpful - got a complimentary carers ticket without having to ask - explained how headsets worked too. 
5936,"Really a five star bathroom/wet room, so spacious and clean. Included everything from shower chair, grab rails, lowered sink etc. "
5937,No radar key lock and also doubles as baby changing which can mean it's engaged for long periods of time.
5938,"We found this cottage on bookings.com, but it is advertised on many different sites. Lots of photos there, which are a true representation.  Large well equipped kitchen.  Generous welcome pack with teas and coffee, milk, a large bowl of fresh fruit, scones and scotch pancakes with butter and jam, breakfast cereals, and samples of local gin, vodka and whisky, together with ice and mixers.   
Very clean, well decorated , light and comfortable. Very good electric lighting of daylight quality. Dogs are welcome, and there is a dog walking field on the host's land."
5939,"Do not go here.  Especially not alone. There is absolutely nothing for the the disabled. Zero. The streets are cobble stones, entrances have high steps and except for modern buildings, lifts or elevators are hard to come by although some older buildings did install them. For example to reach the Senior Faculty Lounge at Balliol College (a modern room) there are tons of stairs. To see a Shakespearean Play at Merton College, there are uneven ancient steps galore. Its and beautiful city with friendly people and busdrivers but very little for challenged people. N"
5940,"Access in was good with large entrance doors that were automatic. Once inside it was easy to move around as a powerchair user with smooth surfaces and wide open spaces. Also, quite good to be able to take shelter from the changeable weather outside."
5941,Sandos has the best accessible bathroom of anywhere i have stayed.  Hotel is on several levels but plenty of ramps and lifts.  We hired a mobility scooter but didn't get a lot of use from it as there is no promenade to stroll along.  We went to the nearest village on the scooter which is up a steep hill  - wouldn't have managed it with my husband pushing my wheelchair. Hotel has several pools a couple are heated and a couple are adult only. Hotel is all inclusive - fantastic food and great range of drinks. Would go back as bathroom is so good but would hire a car to get to other towns.
5942,"A gondola ride up a mountain to a cosy cafe, mineral shop and outdoor adventure land. It was far too cold and misty for us to explore much of the outside areas, but the parking, toilets and gondola ride itself are all great."
5943,Very helpful. Nothing too much trouble.
5944,"The approach to the old pub lies in beautiful scenic countryside (photo 1) around the delightful ancient small town of Henley in Arden. ( Set your Sat NAV for B95 5 HJ) and it stands alongside the Stratford and Avon canal (photo 2) in the village of Lowsonford. One of the famous buildings here is the Fleur de Lys (photo 3) originally a 17th century public house, by the same name, and was later known for its pies, baked here in the 1950,s. The pub supplied many of the counties fish and chip 
shops, before expanding its sales nationwide, and then taken over by Pukka Pies, a firm based in Leicestershire.
The Fluer de Lys is named after the job of a Murenger, an officer who had charge of the wall of a town, perhaps originating from the pub in Newport, Gwent. His job was to collect tolls for the repair of town walls, and these taxes were called Mirage.
Following our lovely drive to get here, and set alongside the canal, the old 17th century pub looked inviting when we saw it. (photo 3) and the car park is large, on hard core, ( photo 4) so easy for wheelchair use. No actual disabled bays, but all parking is close enough. Easy access to the entrance door over paved slabs (photo 5) all on the level, with a nice shady place to sit under large canopy. 
As you enter the pub, (photo 6) it has kept its character with that olde world appearance, and to get in it is all on the level. There is a seating area on the flat as you entered, ideal to place your wheelchair or scooter, i(photo 7) and a powerchair could manage, although in limited areas, but unfortunately, to get to the bar to order there are steps, (photo 8) so your carer would have to do the ordering for you, so a disabled person would not be able to get to the bar area, or even to get to the well signed toilets, as there are steps from now on. The bar has a character with a rustic appearance (photo 9) with plenty of old world wooden beams, you can imagine life here in the past. The large log burning fireplace has plenty of logs stacked ready for use (photo 10) so warming and welcoming on a cold winters day.
Exiting the pub, they have endeavoured to try to brighten up the area with a colourful display of a few plabts, (photo 11) and if it is a warm day, suitable to sit outside, a disabled person could manage quite well, with plenty of tables and chairs under cover (photo 12)  but there is another area under a large canopy, by the staked hay bales, but this has large chippings on the floor, and that would be difficult. Beyond this you find a large open grass field with table and chairs alongside the canal, (photo 13) which was very picturesque, and easily enough for wheelchair to be pushed across.
Our final thoughts.
If the weather is warm enough and you can sit outside, it is worth the visit, the ride through pretty countryside in itself is worth taking just to get here, then it’s an attractive olde world 17th century pub, with an historical story to tell, but the inside of the pub is not at all disabled friendly with lots of steps, and we could not find a way on the flat to reach the toilets. If you can sit outside, it’s very pleasant with lots of shaded canopies if hot, or to protect you from a sudden shower or two. You will get your chair across the well kept grassland for views over the canal, so all in all, for outside use we could recommend taking the afternoon trip and enjoying the olde pub. But because of limited use for disabled we will only offer 2.5 marks.
We did this trip as part of our historical canal trip, which we will offer you a full detailed review of the days trip itself in our final review for the whole trip, combining everywhere we visited, which makes for a delightful day out, and one you can manage quite well."
5945,"Most of the paths throughout the garden are wide. Surfaces are a mixture of tarmac and (mainly light) gravel. Drop kerbs are available to enable access to the grassed areas. Some of the rock gardens would be more difficult to access. The cafe is fully accessible, with automatic doors. The glasshouses also have automatic doors, though some of the paths inside are narrow."
5946,Welcoming and helpful.
5947,"No access problems at all. Lots of sounds, smells and sights to work with. Staff seem knowledgeable."
5948,"Not entirely sure about parking, but there are great bus links just outside the entrance to the venue, and a pedestrian crossing straight to the pop-up. "
5949,"The toilets were perfectly adequate for me. I had no difficulties - and as I say they'll have there Changing Places toilet up and running quicker than you can say antidisestablishmentarianism (by there next home game, I believe). If you require a hoist, you're safest bet is to ask for a seat close to this. And EG are going to send them cards from the Red Cord Campaign, too!"
5950,"The hotel is an old Victorian building, while it is not step free and unsuitable for wheelchair users, it would be suitable for some people with limited mobility who can manage a couple of steps. The hotel is on the sea front and this area is totally flat. It's about a 2 - 3 minute level walk from the Sidmouth Triangle, where the local buses stop. There are two entrances both of which have two steps and two sets of doors. However wherever there are a couple of steps there are brass grab rails attached to the walls. As someone who uses a crutch I found the Payne’s Bar and Restaurant entrance on the Esplanade easier to use as the first door was kept open when the restaurant was open. Once in the hotel there are another couple of steps in the lobby, again with brass grab rails. The reception and restaurant and bar are all on the ground floor. There is a staircase or a small lift with a pull/push door and a metal gate. Sometimes when I called the lift the button didn’t light up but that was because it was in use and if I waited a moment and then called the lift again it would light up and come quickly.My room had a ensuit bathroom with shower cubicle. There was a step to get into the shower but it had a grab rail. In addition when I called to book and I told them about my disability they arranged for there to be a couple of non slip bath mats in the shower. I had a large balcony and there was a couple of steps to climb over to get to it. Overall the hotel has tried hard to be accommodating given the limitations of the age of the building."
5951,Level access to meeting house from front and rear. Garden path and gate from rear a little narrow.
5952,The site is fully accessible with garden and riverside location. The information and signage is clear concise and consistently good. There are options of self catering and riverside family rooms which are easily accessible. The friendly - social model culture is a characteristic of Double Gate Farm
5953,In the ground floor there is one accessible bathroom. The toilet has handrails.
5954,Disabled parking is directly near the front door.
5955,"The disabled toilet can be found across the courtyard, about 10 metres from the accessible entrance. The toilet is unisex and you have to get the keys for it from behind the bar. It's about 6ft by 4ft with lateral transfer space and wall mounted rails, some of which dropped down. There is a sink and hand dryer. This toilet didn't have a functioning alarm, paper hand towels or a coat hook."
5956,"All very helpful but as the store was quite busy the couldn't dedicate masses of time to each customer. However, all staff were very knowledgeable and food was delivered very quickly."
5957,The toilets at the quad are accessible on every floor with an electric cord in all. The toilets are spacious to allow enough room to manoeuvre a wheelchair as well as space for the career. The toilets are well equipped with grab rails. They are also very tidy as they are regularly checked and cleaned.  
5958,"The venue is easily accessed via the main door which has no steps. They have gone to a huge amount of effort and put in a lift to the upstairs disabled toilet, keeping the lift area clear of tables.

The food is also incredible mixing Mexican favourites with street food."
5959,There are disabled parking spaces at the front of the theatre but as the theatre is in the city centre and spaces are limited in Canterbury the theatre spaces are often taken by disabled shoppers. There is not even a sign discouraging this so it is often necessary to drop off and drive to find alternative parking and walk back. This is very awkward at the end of the show. Rating 3
5960,Adequate.You always want more space but it did the job. Children's high chairs are stored there. Would be better if they could keep them elsewhere.
5961,Helpful and willing to take us to our space.
5962,"Very cheerful, they are very busy at lunch but always put on a smile."
5963,A newish build done with accessibility in mind though the salad bar might be a problem for chair users.
5964,Disabled parking at front door
5965,Waterstones Piccadilly is the flagship store of the book store chain. It's a large shop spread over several floors accessible by lifts and has in the basement and on top floor cafes. There are disabled toilets.
5966,"A wonderfully inclusive day out. Accessible throughout with the exception of the very top of the historic glass house. 
Fantastic to see a changing place with hoist. We were able to see everything and were able to access the exhibits too, including a tree top walkway. "
5967,You access at Heathrow terminal one for disabled users is very good because it's very spacious and they have very good signage for us to know where the lists at terminal one out very big as well see you could get three for possibly five or jazz analyst at once
5968,There is a few disabled car parking spaces near the ferry terminal.
5969,As mentioned above
5970,"The accessible toilets were at the start of the park. They were clean and well kept, as well as spacious. Other, non-accessible toilets were situated frequently and well sign posted throughout the park and I was able to use these frequently. "
5971,"As with much of Rome, cobbles prevail! But they are noticeably flatter and smoother than cobblestone surfaces I am used to at home. They're certainly very worn down around this daily market. Camp de'Fiori is colourful, lively, and a great place to pick up gifts or fresh produce."
5972,There are disabled toilets accessible at the rear of each stand.  They are very roomy and can accommodate Wheelchairs and mobility scooters with plenty of room for carers.  They were clean and well looked after when I was there.
5973,Delightful. Eager to help. Practically fighting to be the first one to get the ramps down for me - and happy to give me a wee push on request!
5974,Access throughout the O2 is excellent.
5975,"There are two accessible parking bays which are the closest spaces to the store. The spaces have hatch markings, making it easy to get in and out of the car. "
5976,On street parking 
5977,We arrived by cruise ship which was at the heart of town. We did not need local transport. 
5978,"personally i like to do things myself and keep under the radar. HOWEVER, Moira is a fantastic host. Don't feel shy, give her a call. She will keep you right. Wish i'd spoken to her right at the start of my planning. I hardly know her but I have a lot of respect for this lady."
5979,Disabled Parking and public transport is excellent at the Trafford centre 
5980,"The staff are very approachable, friendly and helpful. They offer assistance as and when required and are located throughout the venue."
5981,There are just a few access issues but otherwise The Sun is great. Food here is excellent - lovely to sit in the garden on a sunny day. Inside it's on two levels separated by steps. However both levels are accessible just not one directly from the other! The accessible loo is on the lower level.  The car park has two disabled spaces but the fact that it is deep pea shingle makes it really hard to negotiate on foot or by wheelchair ( I had to be dragged backwards by wheelchair). However it's a short distance.
5982,"The access into Hollywood is great for wheelchair users, the entrance is on a flat service. To reach the cash register their is a ramp available with hand rails for easy access."
5983,"The entrance is level with the paved area outside, there are no steps. There are two doors to go into the restaurant, they are lightweight & easy to open."
5984,"Great! When you get to the entrance there is an express lane and disabled people get free entry. You then take one of their very funky lifts to one of the floors to start your tour. When you are at the ticket counter you get a ticket to the Picasso Guernica exhibition with a set time allocation - so make sure you check that out! The museum is in a lovely cool and old building - so it's a welcome respite from the Madrid heat. The building is made up of 'corridors' with exhibition rooms leading off them - most of these rooms had a step but there had been sturdy metal ramps installed for all the rooms we wanted to visit. There's decent signage all around the museum - and smaller leaflets available for each of the different exhibitions. Exhibitions are well thought out and spaciously laid out - a mixture of art on walls, free standing sculptures and curated displays. The shop is on the way out and there is a decent cafe too! "
5985,"I wouldn't call it accessible, but they've done what they can - a dozen or so steps down, then a 90 degree turn and a few more steps down to the door to the loos (and another area with further tables).

On the way down the stairs you can check out some of the goods for sale - i picked up a lovely Moroccan bowl.

Stairs are metal with a textured surface which helps your feet grip. Chunky banister right down - poss. both sides? Definitely on left though.

The accessible loo itself had plenty of room for me - although of course I'd had to leave the scooter upstairs!"
5986,"Of the 5 destinations, Barcelona was the only one that had wheelchair accessible taxis. Other than that, disabled passengers must be able to climb onto a coach. Electric wheelchairs can not be taken on tour excursions, unless by pure luck the coach has a wheelchair lift. Cannes is a tender port, which means the disabled passenger must be able to walk steps with assistance. To have wheelchair friendly transport on tour excursions, the tour operators must be informed well in advance, and passengers may be asked to pay an extortionate fee for a 'medivan' - I was quoted $900 for a return trip."
5987,Costa Coffee Shop has a disabled access toilet with grab rails etc
5988,"Disabled loo is fine,  with rails , but of tight squeeze for a carer."
5989,"Assist staff are excellent. They have set area's for wheelchairs, stand alone  chairs if you need more room for whatever reason. Access to a disabled toilet. The member of staff helping me checked on me regularly to make sure I was comfortable, was there anything she could get me etc. I was treated very well and it made the whole evening a very enjoyable experience. There is a number to phone to arrange and more information on their website about what is available."
5990,Boundary park has disabled parking spaces outside the home stand and the club website says there are 40 blue badge parking spaces for home and away supporters that do not need to be pre-booked. However the car park is on slightly uneven ground for a the tail lift so we went to the B&Q a couple of minutes walk from the ground and they kindly let us park there for the duration of the match.
5991,Highlight? The food - always.
5992,"We had read the resume for Kailzie and thought it would be good for a visit.
The steep slope to the entrance in gravel was a bit of a trial to push up.
The gardens themselves were also quite hard to navigate going up hill to the Walled garden made me puff a bit and getting the wheelchair round the garden wasn't easy.
The slope going down to the lower part of the garden was very steep and we didn't attempt this.
On a positive the cakes in the cafe looked delicious."
5993,Staff cheery and helpful. 
5994,Overall staff were pleasant and helpful the staff at the main entrance were slow to respond when we asked for help and directions as they were busy dealing with other customers.
5995,"You would need to drive here I'd imagine. There's a big car park with two blue badge spaces. These were helpfully by the door. The car park is firmly surfaced and level but there's a small but steep ramp up to the patio which was tricky for my walker. Not a major issue, just something to be aware of and take your time with."
5996,"There is a disabled toilet available on the corridor between the Clothworkers Yard entrance and lift, but given the narrow corridor this is impractical to get in to. There are several other more accessible toilets available in other buildings, including full changing facilities, if preferred (see Leeds University Union review)."
5997,"Clean, accessible facilities in close proximity to cafe and shop."
5998,Friendly and informative.
5999,Staff friendly and helpful
6000,"Very accessible with lifts in the two storey properties, brilliant wet rooms and low level kitchens appliances fitted."
6001,"You can park your car outside the front door, It is then no more than 10 feet to the front door."
6002,"Staff were lovely, helpful, friendly and lots of them! "
6003,Apart from the long distance from parking spaces in the shopmobility park there is excellent access inside. All flat. It is let down by there only being one small lift by the food court entrance. As prams have to use it too there is a wait when it is not even that busy. Saturday must be a nightmare.
6004,Close to the M62 with numerous disabled parking bays adjacent to the front door. Entry from car Park to reception is level.
6005,Staff were wonderful and very attentive.
6006,"We parked in Chamber street as we were not aware of any closer blue badge spaces, this was only a 10 minute walk/roll to the meeting place. The meeting point is also within 5 minutes walk of lots of the LRT bus routes."
6007,Neutral interactions.
6008,"Wheelchair friendly restaurant. Gorgeous food. Friendly, helpful staff."
6009,"The hotel is situated in a square opposite the Grand Hotel, there are parking meters all around the square but it is VERY difficult to get a space, we parked around the corner and walked to the hotel, you can drop off outside the hotel or park for 3 hours on double yellow lines with a blue bade just at the front."
6010,"The staff were friendly and helpful, but did make too many excuses about the disabled toilet."
6011,We were allowed to park beside the reception for 15 minutes and then we parked about 1 minute away from the entrance to the hotel. You'll need to book your car parking at least 24 hours before your stay.
6012,"There is an accessible toilet on the roof top but it is not signed and if coming to it from the lower level of the rooftop, the ramp is almost impossible without someone pushing hard. There was a railing to stop other people entering the accessible toilet which also prevented me from getting in without a friend to open it. Once along the flat wooden corridor you need to use a knife to open the toilet door, because they lock it like that from the outside.  

The stall itself was very large with space for a carer but only one grab rail. They had a read cord that was properly installed however. No sink in the stall so you have to roll back down the very steep ramp to wash your hands. All the toilets are compost toilets so it has a very DIY feel to it."
6013,They are well trained and know their stuff about the history of town.
6014,This was a clean and friendly place. It was easily accessible. It had automatic doors and was street level. The prices of drinks and cake reasonable.
6015,Disabled toilets situated at the main entrance. They were quite tight though.
6016,This was more difficult our disabled adapted vehicle is too high for the underground multi story. I did ask a security man who said I could park in the coach bay. Atbristol did offer to help.
6017,Car park available with wide disabled bays. There are also some on street disabled bays. 
6018,Far more accessible toilets required and those that are provided should be radar locked. Please stop lumping disabled access toilets with baby change facilities why is this considered acceptable campaign needed please. Toilets inside arena more needed with radar locks. Outside venue but still in complex only one accessible toilet under stairs near cinema and it's baby change as we'll grrrrrr  not radar locked either . Only alternative is to use a restaurant but this is not ideal . Also toilets in the car park would be good after a long journey it a fair distance to the complex
6019,"Large car park, with three spaces reserved for disabled customers.
Very accessible restaurant."
6020,The Staff at the Scotch Whisky Experience upstairs and the team in the restaurant were fabulous. It makes such a difference when you are greeted with a warm welcome! 
6021,There are accessible slopes in and out the dingle itself and the Quarry park and down into Shrewsbury town centre.
6022,"Overall the disabled access to Castle Howard was good, however due to the nature of the building, there are some parts of the house that just aren't accessible.  There is a wheelchair lift for access to the main part of the house.  Hearing loops are available along with wheelchairs to borrow if necessary.  There is ample disabled parking and onsite land transport to take you from the car park to the main house.  The gardens are mostly accessible with gravel and turf pathways."
6023,"A beautiful, magical outdoor trail of light and sound. Lifted the spirit during a very challenging time!"
6024,Won't be returning due to their fire safety policies for disabled customers. Segregation and worst seats. Rubbish.
6025,Good sized toilet located at the front entrance.
6026,"I reached Booths on my scooter and therefore did not need to park. From what I could see - there are 5 disabled bays either side of the main entrance - they are part of the pay-and-display car park directly outside the main entrance. The fee is low (60p for the 1st hour, I think) and begins after 30 minutes."
6027,"Great cafe in the heart of Glasgow city centre with a friendly atmosphere, attentive staff and wheelchair accessible. Lovely selection of food and drinks. Vegan options available."
6028,"There was parking very close to the park gate and the route would be wheelchair accessible.
Taxis can also get very close to the entry - I didn't notice public transport."
6029,"Changing Places toilet at the main entrance building. Standard accessible toilets are at every location where there are also Ladies' and Gents' toilets, including both floors of the Link and the Core. Space not filled with bins/etc."
6030,There are two publicly accessible disabled toilets through the reception area and to the left of the cafe. There is step free access to the building via the ramp on Holyrood Park Road. There are further disabled toilets in the changing village for swimmers.
6031,"There are toilets located in the visitor’s centre and the Link in between the biomes, they have room for wheelchair access plus assistance if needed. They also have hoists that can be used, an adjustable changing bench and a shower. The toilets are also fitted with a description service for those who are visually impaired describing the room making it easier for them to use the room. "
6032,"There are disabled toilets both inside and outside the centre, both toilets are quite small but both have handrails and staff are always happy to help to show you the way. The toilets do get quite busy in the summer time."
6033,Staff at the counter are very polite and helful. Gave directions to the screen the movie was showing clearly and accurately.
6034,There is a door at the end of the bar signed Toilets. Down a corridor which is just wide enough for the wheelchair is a good disabled toilet with a grab bar and full length mirror. Lever handle taps.
6035,The parking at Tidmoor Cottages is fine as you park next to the cottage which makes it very easy for unloading.
6036,"There may be good disabled parking places, but if you are in a vehicle that is Tax Exempt, you will still have to pay for parking as they declare they cannot access DVLA to check so you need to notify them that you are tax exempt and jump through their hoops to park free!"
6037,Would be better if children did not use the disabled toilets as I had to wait both times I used the toilet due to others using it.
6038,See previous comments
6039,"A well-modernized gallery with a good collection of 19th century paintings, including paintings which reflect local life and industry on Tyneside.  Fully accessible."
6040,There are no steps and the café is all on one level. We ordered at the counter but were served at our table.
6041,"If arriving by public transportation, Groet is accessible by bus from the Alkmaar train station. If you have special needs, be sure to call in advance to ensure the bus is suitable for your needs.  If arriving by taxi, the company Accessible Travel Netherlands can make arrangements for you.  If traveling by car, accessible parking is available near the restaurant.  The restaurant can also be accessed from many of the bicycle trails in the area."
6042,"Straight off the street into the pub, no steps."
6043,"Large disabled toilet, easily enough room for a wheelchair and carer. Toilet just outside auditorium on ground floor."
6044,"First/last section near castle was on a good surface. The first/last section from behind the castle down to riverside was quite steep - down was fine but on the return leg had to be assisted, despite having battery power.  The early section by the river is Tarmac and therefore smooth.  The far end is more of a woodland trail though not too bad if you've got sturdy wheels - I would only suggest attempting the upper section in a very sturdy off road machine (my Viper power cycle coped well but even that needed the oacccasional shove).  Sections higher up the Beck got rougher and there were sections of deep mud (there'd been a lot of rain). Also some of the upper sections were a bit steep and uneven so I appreciated having someone with me."
6045,"Staff are friendly and helpful; will bring drinks over if required, and food is brought to your table when it's ready. 
Might have to wait at the bar for a while if it's busy. "
6046,There are a few car parks near Specsavers which are all around about a 5-minute walk away with lots of disabled parking spots available.  There is no parking available directly in front of the shop due to the area being pedestrianized. Which may make it unsuitable for some people with disabilities. The area surrounding Specsavers is very wheelchair accessible as all of the pavements are flat although the bumpy stone paving in between might gie yi a sare bum lol. The nearest bus station is about a 5-minute walk from Specsavers outside St Giles shopping centre where there is a disabled toilet which can be accessed using a radar key or by asking staff for access. The nearest train is about a 15-minute walk away and is beside Asda where a disabled toilet can be found either in Asda or at the train station. There is a busy road on the route to the train station from Specsavers. There are lots local of taxis available which are wheelchair accessible. 
6047,Very helpful 
6048,"There is level access to the premises. Plenty of space to move about inside.
"
6049,Mostly volunteers as the cafe is a Community run concern.
6050,"Access to disabled toilet was brilliant, staff extremely helpful."
6051,There are six disabled parking spaces next to capability and the pavement is flat.
6052,Easy Slopes where necessary but some doors quite heavy. Could see and experience all parts of the centre. 
6053,Staff are incredibly friendly and will come and check on you whenever you visit.
6054,"With a wheelchair accessible vehicle to pick you up and drop you off, you can see  as much as you want! Every effort has been made to make the zoo as accessible as possible and staff will gladly help you out. Tigers, lions, penguins and pandas plus many more. Restaurants and picnic areas are available and there are accessible toilets throughout.

Hills can be steep though so beware!"
6055,"the staff could not be any more helpful, I arrived at 8.45am and staff were just going into start as the office opens at 9am, I was informed when they opened, I asked if they could answer a few questions in relation to my visit and they were only to pleased to help. On entering at 9am I was greeted with a old fashion Good Morning that makes you feel welcome. All in ALL a great service and 10-10 to the staff."
6056,Helpful in making space by moving some furniture and opening doors. 
6057,"I was met at the door by  vicar Martin Weaver (If I remember correctly) who not only offered his help and showed me around the Abbey but also gave me a private (!) tour to the top of the tower! The Abbey is magnificent with lots of interesting things to see. It has become famous lately with Asian tourists as famous Asian couple married there recently: https://youtu.be/s34fl3eFYMc
The building itself is steeped in history with fantastic architecture and lots of interesting features and artefacts. You can buy guide book which has self-conducted tour. There are no entry fees but there is donation box at the entrance.
Abbey is completely accessible to wheelchair users (through side entrance) with ramps and even, unobstructed flooring. Main entrance has 4 steps down with rails on both side. There is a gift shop and café on site (see photos for prices). 
Toilets Incl. disabled) are next to the café 
 Easily reached from Micklegate car park or train/bus station"
6058,Easy to find. Well equipped though no alarm cord. No room to turn a wheelchair due to fixed baby changing unit. Functional and clean.
6059,There are 12 spacious pre bookable blue badge parking bays. These can be booked via the telephone and the website clearly explains how to get to the vehicle entrance. There spaces are located adjacent to one of the level access entry doors
6060,"The King's Fund is a charity that works towards improving health care. Their offices contain a library which is open to the public. I visited to attend Bertie's Book Club, a group that meets monthly to discuss books with a medical theme. The evening I attended they were discussing The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon. "
6061,"Lovely place to visit with shops and café which are fully accessible.  The country park is mostly accessible for wheelchair users but could do with more seating areas for people with walking aids. The shops are good for ladies and gents clothing, gifts and food and drink. The courtyard which gives access to the shops, café and ticket office has a slabbed path all around with a pebbled area in the middle. There are picnic benches in the pebbled area."
6062,"Mildred's is located on the ground floor of a modern building and is entirely step free. There is a small al fesco dining area outside with free standing tables and chairs. The outside area is roofed over, see photo. 

The entrance has double manual doors, which were open when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious and due to social distancing measures there is plenty of space between tables, see photo. There are free standing tables and chairs without arms, as well as a couple of sofas.  "
6063,"The communal accessible toilet was out of order for the duration of my visit.
My accessible wet room was fine for me.  Grab handles around toilet but nothing by the shower.  The plastic chair was non-draining.
I passed these observations on and I am absolutely reassured that they will be quickly sorted."
6064,"Parking in St Ives is over three car parks. The top car park on the way by the hospital was very large with several disabled spaces, but was a 15 minute walk into the town and all the way up hill on the return journey, which was too much for the man with wheels. We parked in the car park up from the Tate gallery. This only had two blue badge spaces and had the only disabled toilet in the whole of the town centre. The other car park was Sloop hill but despite having 6 spaces for blue badges, they were always taken. One day we ended up parking on the yellow lines outside the Tate for the three hour limit we are allowed with the badge. Its a get up early job!

The streets of St Ives are narrow and if you have a big car or van it is a tight squeeze. Sloop hill is on an incredibly sharp turn! Also blue badge holders have to pay for parking so bring change. We do get an extra hour compared to normal drivers. 
Cornwall council has a scheme where if you pay £10 in advance you can park anywhere in Cornwall for free and it lasts all year. If your car like ours has been adapted you can register for free, but you must have the V5 number available. All this has to be done in advance, as it all goes on your number plate and I watched someone get a ticket who had obviously not registered and not brought a ticket!

6065,"Ramped access to the building, level into the temporary library."
6066,Excellent flat access 
6067,Really pleasant and cheerful.
6068,"Very polite and helpful, quick to act once aware there was an issue."
6069,"Theway in is fine, though there are a few cobblestones but these didn't give my chair any problems. The barriers by the entrance were in the way of my wheelchair but were easily shifted.  I let my carer go into the ticket office as it looked a bit narrow.  Once inside, the central area of the castle is grass. It's mainly even but with a few humps and lumps to negotiate. There are a few bumpy thresholds to go into rooms round the edge - these were generally gravelly or stone. Simple wooden ramps would help make these navigable but as they are, they're a bit uneven. At the further end, the grass slopes down quite steeply  and care is needed (getting down was fine,but I needed help back up).  There is a flight of stairs up to a set of rooms - these were completely inaccessible.  Interestingly a wooden step has been installed elsewhere on one slope for able bodied visitors - a shame no ramps though!"
6070,"I did not come across any steps. Very accessible place,"
6071,"Some car parking spaces
Bus stop about 50 yards away
Train in the town
Most guests arrived by coach"
6072,"Love this place and have visited and performed there over the years but this is my first visit as a disabled customer. The owners have done their best to make the venue as accessible as possible but are limited by the restrictions of the building.
Visit if you can. It’s well worth it."
6073,We visited the disabled toilets so we acknowledged that they were there.
6074,The staff were fantastic and they made sure that I got to the front of the stage for the concert so that I could see.
6075,There is a direct route from the High Street carpark to the High Street shops itself. You can walk through a small vennel from the car park straight onto the main street which is all pedestrianised so it's relatively safe for most people to walk about. The only thing I would say is that it can at times be a shared spaces area as some people do drive down at certain times of the day so I would one visually impaired people to perhaps ask a local shop owner about the busiest times. There are accessible parking spaces for disabled motorists on the High Street itself which are marked on the paving stones.
6076,Very friendly and helpful in both the house and cafe.
6077,The disabled parking outside is clearly labelled and also on entering the facility the lift and toilets are clearly signed. There are seats available in reception which can be easily accessed. The facility has no steps on both entrances and is flat which is ideal for wheelchair access. In addition the doors are automatic throughout the facility which is also very useful. 
6078,Easy to get into the building. The theatre is downstairs but there is a lift. We also got a lift to the theatre we were in.  Also got some front row seats which was pretty cool.
6079,You need a car to get here really as I am not aware of a bus stop nearby. The car park has been greatly expanded but is very rough for the most part. The disabled bays are tarmacked but you still need to cross the rough ground to get out of it.
6080,4/5 disabled parking spots
6081,The shop and cafe's/restaurants are great with solid ground. There are no steps but the paths are all uneven gravel paths. In my  NHS top of the range manual wheelchair I struggled and needed help in places. If you have a not so good wheelchair I can imagine it being a struggle. Also there were a lot of young kids there when we arrive who do what kids do in gravel and drag their feet so all the dust blows up at the perfect height of someone in a wheelchair.
6082,"The hotel has its own carpark. There is plenty of space, including room directly outside the front door. The surface was slightly loose gravel, but the transfers were manageable independently. "
6083,"I had Passenger Assistance booked on 15:02 train from Torquay to Paddington on 18/09/2021. I arrived at the ticket office at 14.25. 1 counter had notice position closed and 2 counter I am currently providing assistance on the station. Both notices said require tickets use machine, no advice re PA. I knocked on glass and called out that I had booked PA I am disabled and require help and asked if anyone there. No reply. Left case in ticket office, went to platform, called out had anyone seen staff, I was very distraught by this time. Man assisted and knocked on platform door. I returned to ticket office to case. Closed position now occupied. Staff 1 said he heard me but was at his lunch. I'm sure he could have heard the panic and my request for help. Would it really have been too much to pop his head around and say I'm on my lunch break I'll be with you in x minutes? Staff 2 arrived to assist, had been on opposite platform gardening. I was pre-booked. Staff 2 said there was only stairs and started to take my case across. It was only when I was on opposite platform that I realised that there is a street entrance from my platform. This would be a step free route although it would have involved walking through the car park, over the railway bridge to enter my required platform. Why could not this option have been suggested to me so I could have avoided the stairs. Staff 2 said another train due. I agreed to continue over bridge and that my case could be left at bottom of steps. By the time I had finished crossing I could see him talking to 2 members of staff who held batons. He then came over with my case. He was helpful and stayed with me till I boarded the train. He told me I was in B84 and that is where the platform narrows. He said if I couldn’t manage the gap he could get a wheelchair and take me to another carriage at the other end of the train. Train arrived and there was a huge gap, a high, narrow step to stand on and inside grab rails (not outside rails) which made me have to over reach. I took a photo before boarding. Who at PA HQ thought boarding at Carriage B at Torquay was suitable for a person with a mobility disability who walks with a crutch? Staff 2 now said he could get a ramp if required. I said I didn’t want to delay the train. Boarding was a struggle. Staff 2 said he would phone through to Paddington to let them know I was on the train and said it reflected badly on him when the destination station did not have staff to meet their PA customers. I tweeted about this when on board the train and posted photo of the gap. "
6084,"Car park right outside the entrance but not tarmac , loose gravel. Slope to double width door . No steps."
6085,"Good station access. Easy to find, to get ticket, find train, and depart."
6086,"Easily Accessible, plenty of disabled toilets and with friendly, helpful staff if needed."
6087,Very helpful and friendly. 
6088,"The accessible toilet is too small, so that it's very hard to manoeuvre and turn once you're inside. In addition the rubbish bins take up far too much space and make the transfer to the toilet very hard. The toilet is usable, but it's uncomfortable and far from ideal."
6089,You need to pick up the key from the cash desk in the shop if you want to use this toilet it is not a radar key. The key is on a very large metal key ring that is made not to fit in your pocket . It is good basic wheelchair toilet located next to the other toilets and was well sign posted as you entered main door there is also a very quick right hand turn to get to the door. The light comes on automatically as you enter the toilet  
6090,"Although the staff where polite and willing to help. They struggled to understand me whilst I asked for help. They explained that they had recently revamped the store to make it more accessible however it was still a struggle to easily move around the store. 

 It was rather comical as we left the store a lady  (possibly the manager) came running over to us as we where about to leave the store to ask if we needed any help. To which we replied no thank you we are just leaving."
6091,There was plenty of space for a wheelchair and assistant. A drop down grab rail and one attached to the wall are very helpful. 
6092,Are disabled spaces in Chambers Stret but usually taken.
6093,"They have one toilet for everyone which has all the rails, lowered sink etc. Only issue is that the corridor it's on isn't the largest, Paul used it no bother not sure if a powerchair user might struggle though."
6094,"Do not stop rides for people with physical impairments or those unsteady on their feet.  a number of rides you have to climb in/out of.  
On one ride we saw the disabled/ wheelchair sign next to a set of stairs.  We did not have a wheelchair user in our group but they would be very hard pressed to find ways to get to any rides"
6095,Given the vessel is floating the access can be difficult at times according to the level of tide. There are two access ramps to board and embark. These can at times be set at a very steep angle and may make it difficult to get aboard. Once on board access was very good and a lift will take you to the various levels of the ship.
6096,"8 designated parking spaces at the entrance with level access in a big car park.
"
6097,I got the train into Edinburgh and used my scooter to get to the venue. Some areas are partially cobbled and due to hills it would be hard in a manual wheelchair. Busses and taxis are easy to access throughout the city. During the festival there are certain roads closed to cars so remember this. It is also VERY busy so give yourself extra time to get to venues.
6098,"Some doors not automated, one small cobbled section to cross."
6099,"Just returned from 3 days in the beautiful city of Bath.  My husband is in a wheelchair T3 spinal injury.  The hotel was easy to find and very central. We parked up in the street and had prepaid for parking. The hotel staff helped us unload and then took the car to the private parking area.  We had an accessible bedroom. The room was nicely decorated but the bed was only accessible for my husband to transfer on from one side . This was fine for us though. The wetroom was perfect and we were able to use our travel showerchair with ease. We asked for extra towels and pillows and these were brought straight away.  The staff also asked if there was an emergency would we need assistance which was nice to know they had this policy in place.  The restaurant for breakfast was nice and airy, the tables are pedestal tables which aren't always easy for wheelchair users to get close enough to the table, but it was fine. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and that really made our stay so successfull. Before we left we asked to have a look at another of the accessible rooms and there was a larger more spacious room which had room all around the bed, however this bed would of been too high for transfers but the manager said after we had pointed this out they would look at changing to a lower bed.  We would definately come again. "
6100,"A spacious disabled toilet can be accessed in the main Foodhall shopping area a short distance from the café, signposted clearly.  It has adequate space for carers and wheelchairs, it was very clean and tidy and well stocked. The facility had grab rails around the toilet (one drop down rail on the right side) and sink area, a pull cord for assistance if required was clearly visible to the left of the toilet.  The low sink enabled easy access with lever action taps for ease of use."
6101,"The main entrance to Pudsey Civic Hall has automatic doors, but sadly the doors after this point are all manual & quite narrow, usually requiring both to be open to allow a normal-sized powered wheelchair through. The downstairs space is large & space will vary depending on the event hosted there. The lift is accessed by going through the main space and a fire exit, which is awkward. The little is small, without mirrors, & is scarily close to the stairs. It makes disconcerting sounds, jolts, & the doors take ages to open. Genuinely terrifying, & I've been in some scary lifts. The corridor upstairs is extremely narrow, & the landing area very quickly becomes crowded. There is 1 disabled toilet on the ground floor which is clean & spacious. The venue is accessible in that I can get through the door, but clearly the building was designed with disability as an afterthought. I believe there are parking spaces nearby. There are busses & trains in the area."
6102,"About half their cruises are in wheelchair accessible steamers, and there is space to sit either inside or outside which is wheelchair accessible. Its a bit expensive but your carer gets to cruise for free, which makes a 'freedom of the lakes' ticket pretty good value (did the yellow, red and blue routes in a day for £19 for me and my hubby). As per their leaflet, the loos on board ship are only accessible by steps, although there are RADAR accessible loos on the quayside. Some improvised queue jumping was arranged by the staff, but there isn't a system for getting disabled people to the front of the queue (except by arriving earlier than everyone else!)"
6103,There were 2 wet room ensuites. One was larger to accommodate wheelchair user with a choice of shower chairs.
6104,Staff were very friendly and welcoming.
6105,Clean accessible disables toilet.
6106,"They were pretty dismissive and focusing on the drive through headsets making it very confusing for people with hearing impairment. They didn’t help my husband (who has sight impairment in one eye and is very unsteady on his feet) with carrying our drinks, even being reluctant to give him a tray."
6107,No difficulty in getting in or out.
6108,Very helpful staff; will carry your drinks or food to your table if you ask them too. 
6109,One disabled loo with s ramp when ch actually had a shower!  Lots of space. Toilet lid collapsed when I pulled the old fashioned change n which might not be best option when you’re disabled 
6110,"I've been many times to The SSE Hydro and always had a good experience, which makes this one of my favourite venues in terms of accessibility as a powered wheelchair user."
6111,"WHEELCHAIR ACCESS LEVEL main areas are level with lifts to upper floors.
 no steps to some seating if you tell staff at time of booking. they can  advise on seating that  is suitable for any mobility problems. 
"
6112,"A step inside separating the two rooms will limit where you can sit.  If busy, turning is tight.  "
6113,"Don't know about parking as we use public transport to get here.  Easily accessible by train, tram and bus"
6114,It is level access in and throughout the centre. Lifts access all floors and these are big enough for a wheelchair user and a few more people. Some lifts have bright flashing lights and music playing inside which could be quite uncomfortable. Signage could be a bit clearer. Of course each shop is different but the centre in general has wide aisles and space to move around. There is also a lot of seating available throughout.
6115,there was a lot of stairs but not that many lifts. There was some induction loops. 
6116,One of the best I have seen. Lots of circulation and transfer space. Adjustable full size sink. Emergency Cord all around wall at 300mm but not colour contrasted. Rails  to toilet have front parts the extend. 
6117,"The staff were fab, they did everything and anything for you.  The staff are a great asset to them"
6118,"After booking an air bnb that boasted its accessibility, I arrived to find there were three steps to enter, and at the last minute on a Friday evening I had to find somewhere that would fit my needs in an area of Edinburgh I was not familiar with. I phoned the premier inn hub and spoke to a lovely guy who said they had one accessible twin room and why don't I pop down, have a cup of tea (for free) and see what they could do to help, it was such a relief! The price was pretty good for the Friday but went up quite a bit for the weekend, that might be partly to do with booking on the day though. There was unlimited tea and coffee in the bar area (self service bit) and the staff were incredibly helpful so we decided to book the night. After one night in a lovely, clean modern room with just amazing staff in the hotel we booked another night. Unfortunetly, I didn't get a picture of the twin room so the picture included is just very similar. "
6119,"On each of our visits, staff have been friendly and helpful throughout."
6120,"I used the normal accessible toilet. It was okay and clean but the gateway in was too narrow for my trike, so I left it outside and walked in. A normal manual chair should be fine though. I didn't see the changing places but I believe there is one. Campsite toilets are in the golf club. These were closed (to campers) due to covid but looked okay. The path to the golf club was smooth and easy... once you get off the field. We mostly used our own facilities though."
6121,Shoreditch High St Overground station is very nearby and is completely step-free :-) and several bus routes run past this branch of Prêt.
6122,Amazing access from the moment you leave the car.
6123,Taxi could drop us off right outside. I think the nearest bus stop is possibly Lothian Road.
6124,"The single door into this eatery is heavy to open, but the entrance is perfectly smooth, level, and wide enough for easy wheelchair access. The floorboards are also smooth, and the tables are spaced apart in such a way that moving between them is very easy. There are a variety of seating options at different heights and types of chairs available. A gender neutral disabled toilet is available by the till, and appears to be the only public toilet available in the unit. Unfortunately, full changing facilities are not available.
 The counter for Bar Burrito is a good height, making communicating your order with the staff very easy, and accessing the card reader to pay is also easy. The staff are incredibly friendly and are always willing to speak to me personally, instead of via a carer.
 Although the standard Bar Burrito policy is to clear away your own rubbish, returning the tray to a stack in the corner, staff often clear my rubbish for me so I don’t have to. Even if they are busy and I end up clearing my own rubbish, it is easily accessible and at an excellent height for me to use.
 The eatery is near the train station, bus stop, and car park, and is on a popular router for taxis. The pavement is mostly level, with the odd wobbly paving stone causing minor bumps.
"
6125,"Again, because it’s a separate concern, we can only offer low marks for access. It’s an absolutely beautiful Spa, but you are faced with a downhill approach to start with, my husband applied the brakes on the wheelchair to slow the ride down, then it’s all on the level, with path to avoid steps, and there is a lift available to get you to the lower level. We saw everything we needed to see to offer you our review, but then you have to face getting back up the steep hill again to return to car park and hotel."
6126,Really really well kept and extremely clean. Plenty of space for aids and several people at once. Both hand held and stationary shower making showers very pleasant for Nan.  With handrails and shower chair / Camode. With separate ensuite for us. 
6127,"Myself and another wheelchair were told to get there early so we could get in and get to the wheelchair area before it got busy, however, no staff where there to open the accessible entrance, and we couldn't get in to let them know we were there. There people using walking frames who had been waiting before us. I then asked a other member of audience to inform the staff- which they did. We then had to scramble through the crowd  (after asking asking staff for help, which didn't happen) We got to the disabled area. This was a fantastic view, close to the stage and close to the audience so you really felt part of the audience. The only downside was that when I ask to use the toilet and was told it was on the other side of the venue with looks of what do want us to do. which is shame as this spoilt an otherwise great night."
6128,"Savignypl. 11, 10623 Berlin, Germany, 
There are  about 10 restaurants in this lovely little square, after visiting them all to try and get dinner, I found this was the only one with a disable toilet. It is a great busy place about a miles walk (or wheel) from the zoo, great to eat out of an evening and they do great Vietnamese food"
6129,The car park is tarmac with limited disabled parking spaces. On a busy day such as the bank holiday we visited the disabled spaces were full but was plenty of paces on the tarmac  the overflow car park is a feild
6130,"Lots of wide accessible parking spaces, on tarmac, right beside the front door. Perfect!"
6131,staff are still learning the ropes but they are full of enthusiasm and really friendly and eager for helpful feedback
6132,The food in this restaurant is fantastic and if you like Italian food then you will like this venue. The Restaurant is always busy even on a normal week night. The weekend the place is full and so it is advisable to book well in advance. The setting is made of booths and tables. A chair can be taken away at a table to allow a wheelchair in to the space.
6133,Great view of stage from wheelchair platform.
6134,Lots of disabled spaces ample for every house and more.  Didn't use public transport.
6135,"excellent access, some bumpy surfaces down near the marina (well they were for my small wheeled scooter).  Signs are tall, and I found them not very helpful.  You can't get lost, with it forming a square of ""streets"". There appears to be an upper level but i did not go and nor did I see a way other than stairs.  Lifts are medium size, and buttons at correct height for chairs."
6136,The train journey was really relaxing and there was some lovely scenery. I also learnt a lot of information as it was interactive and hands on.
6137,Accessible toilet easy to find from the restaurant
6138,"First Drivers were allegedly given extra customer service training prior to the opening. There's no evidence of the extra training. Even the drivers who pull up at a tactile at one stop will pull up short at the next stop. Visible disability is not a guarantee. On my first trip on day 2 there was a long cane user sat at the stop. It was highly visible as only 3 of us at the stop. The bus pulled up past the tactile!

First ticket scanners are useless. They require you to put your hand through a small aperture. If you have a crutch or a chair then the driver is going to snatch your pass."
6139,"Located very close to Dundee’s newly-modernised railway station, RSS Discovery and V&A Dundee, the Malmaison is a stylish hotel with well-equipped accessible rooms. The staff could not be more helpful."
6140,Easy access
6141,Found this cafe good for quiet friendly atmosphere. Good for food allergies and coeliac. Friendly staff bit not much room for a wheelchair as very small.
6142,Fixed ramp into venue but need a carer to open the door.  
6143,"The hotel has an on site car park in the basement. Places can be reserved by prior arrangement with the hotel.

There are bus stops within a few metres of the hotel entrance."
6144,"There is on street parking outside the building which is free for blue badge holders. There are two bays saved for disabled badge holders.

 The bus station is about 10 minutes walk away at a moderate pace. 

The pavement is smooth with plenty of flush lowered kerbs and there are crossings on busy main road to get from Intu to Vedi."
6145,"Member of staff did offer to take me to staff lift instead of waiting for the public one
Staff in gallery restaurant will ignore you at bottom of steps if you wanted to eat here which made me feel a bit of a nuisance so we ate elsewhere"
6146,Coastguards on site.
6147,"The hotel is set in the former Scotsman newspaper building so has a lot of character and architectural features. They don’t always lend themselves to good accessibility.

Reviewing from my perspective as a visually impaired person; not taking in to account access for people with mobility impairments."
6148,"There is an accessible toilet at Willows with baby changing facilities inside. It has a standard lock on it but, isn’t extremely spacious. I feel a wheelchair user would struggle if they needed assistance from someone. The toilet is positioned closer to the far corner of the accessible toilet which means that if someone can only transfer from the right-hand side they may struggle. I think the sink is at a reasonable height for wheelchair users however, I feel the pipes underneath might prevent wheelchair users to get in close enough. The emergency red cord was hanging freely and I attached a red cord.

In Broughty Ferry there is a Changing Places toilet down near the beach which is roughly a 10-minute walk away. This facility is open different times of the year depending on what season it is."
6149,"There is a small lip heading in of about an inch and then double doors, although the staff have always held these open for us.  Once inside everything is on the one level."
6150,The staff were really kind and really nice.
6151,"There is free disabled parking outside of gym. 

I came from Derby and the bus stop was located quite a walk away from the gym across a busy road. "
6152,"Clean toilet, spacious, also baby changing facilities."
6153,Very helpful.  Quick to remedy sl problems with tv in bedrooms.
6154,"There is a lift to the next floor, there is no induction loop"
6155,Great wheelchair accessible hotel near the city centre of Glasgow.
6156,There are disabled toilets where you get the boat from (Pooley Bridge) and to (Glenridding). There were also toilets below deck which was fine for our group but the toilets were quite small.
6157,Friendly staff but expensive with hard to get to disabled rooms with single beds and an inaccessible bath.
6158,"Wheelchair friendly , easily accessible and plenty of space to view exhibits. Excellent cafe ( the white chocolate and raspberry flapjacks were delicious!) and good disabled toilet facilities. Museum free but with admission charge for non- permanent exhibitions . However  concessions for disability and free for accompanying carer. Highly recommended.
Would give 5 stars but no immediate parking and I did use my riser for some of the exhibits , which is a facility not always available to other wheelchair users"
6159,The staff seemed generally pleasant and helpful.
6160,"Disabled friendly,nice food, friendly staff and reasonable prices"
6161,"Two toilets right at the back of the restaurant, access is pretty tight. Inside there is one male and one female toilet and a shared sink - but nobody seems to care about the differentiation, so I believe you can use whichever. The accessible toilet is in the one labelled as the female toilet. It's spacious, but pretty rickety which is the main reason stars were dropped."
6162,A seedy part of town that has come up a notch. No mention of Beatles history.
6163,A beautiful house that still has the feel of a family home.
6164,"The heavy door at the front of this building presents issues for some users. Also, the shelves containing books can be a little too high up/low down in places. The doorways are wide enough to permit access with a moderate sized power chair."
6165,All very helpful particularly the front desk 
6166,"This new café, Green Monkey, 2D Tooting Bec Rd, SW17 8BD, a few doors down from Tooting Bec Station, looks very tempting.  There is a big step at the entrance and the café has a folding wheelchair ramp. A major problem is that there is no accessible toilet."
6167,Warm friendly welcome from owner
6168,There's centre street parking on Chambers street and disabled bays are available. There's good transport links by bus from city centre and outlying areas. George IV bridge adjoins and it's a short walk from the stops to the museum. 
6169,"Basic loo, but plenty room enough.  Didn't smell too good."
6170,Ace! We drove - I'm not sure if it is possible to stop here with out driving. There is also overnight parking for caravans too. Be aware that they do lock the gates in the evenings.
6171,There is a lift to all floors. The universally accessible rooms are spacious with wheelchair accessible bathrooms.
6172,There were two accessible toilets off of Peacock Alley.
6173,I must say that the staff of Thistle and Get2Gether were fantastic. 
6174,"There are two entrances to the tearooms.  The first entrance has one small step of approx 10cm.  The second entrance has level access. Signage was not clear, so it would be easy to think that the first entrance was the only entrance, but the main entrance is just a few metres further along.

The tearoom is all on the one level.

Staff are happy to help with menu choices and answer any questions.  I did not see alternative formats such as braille, large print or BSL when I visited.

The tearoom is dog friendly and provides towels to dry off wet / muddy dogs, dog biscuits and water bowls.  "
6175,Parking in crouch end can be busy but there are bays right outside.
6176,"You would need to have transport to stay here. Parking very accessible outside of cottage. Lanes narrow as you would expect this far out in the countryside, but fine for our MPV."
6177,"When entering the Odeon there are automatic doors at the rear access and alongside stairs there are ramps on both the ground and first floor, to get to the ticket office and refreshment shop. To get onto the first floor there is lift access, but due to there only being stairs there is no access for those with limited mobility or Wheelchair users on the second floor for screen 7. The lift is not suitable for large Wheelchairs making visiting this cinema very difficult for some."
6178,"Best to arrive to this venue on foot or by bus, as the cafe is on a main road but a good a good bus route."
6179,The staff here are extremely helpful! They are very accommodating and they are all very sweet.
6180,"Both the revolving door and automatic door can be accessed in a wheelchair; although usually one or the other is out of order. 

As you enter there is a reception desk with lowered counter and T loop to the left and Medequip, convenience store and cafe to the right. There are two lifts near reception. The corridor is long with seating (with arms) at regular intervals. 

The signs are written clearly with some colour coding but I'm not sure if you can class them as large print. I also didn't see braille label's. "
6181,"In the courtyard adjacent to other toilets. Assessed by radar key, obtainable from the Centre. Roomy enough to easily accommodate  a carer and or a wheelchair or scooter, and well equipped with grab rails etc."
6182,TUI arranged for us to drop of our car at Edinburgh airport.
6183,We drove and we parked in a car park at the side of the building which had a few disabled car parking spaces and plenty of space to get in and out of the car.
6184,"This hotel is well situated on two bus routes and also has plenty of parking. It's a good location for Musselburgh. It has recently been refurbished and feels clean and fresh. The staff are helpful and friendly and it's possible to move to the Bistro area without being out of doors, although it is technically next door. There is only one fully accessible bedroom. It was already booked so we stayed in another room which was fine, other than not having a fully accessible bathroom. This is a good choice of hotel on the outskirts of Edinburgh but within easy reach of it.

Updated Dec 2021 - there are now two new accessible rooms and the whole hotel, already very accessible, is more accessibility-aware. Again, just like in the past, the staff are super helpful and flexible. This is a really good choice of accessible accommodation in or near Edinburgh - worth travellling out of town for."
6185,Disabled parking spot 30 seconds away.
6186,"TOILETS and REFRESHMENTS
Good access"
6187,The staff were all very helpful with all issues concerning being in a wheelchair
6188,"Overall access was very good. Checking in was easy and we were directed to our rooms. It is a pity that the reception has no lowered desk but staff were very helpful despite this. There are several lifts which are of a reasonable size. There is a manual door between the lift and the corridor with the bedrooms but it isn't too heavy. Our room was spacious and had an en suite accessible bathroom (see photos). The restaurant, reception and the bar are all on the ground floor with level access between them. Staff are happy to move chairs and there are plenty of low tables."
6189,"Only a couple around today as it was mid day time, with just a few using pool and gym, and on this cold February day not many were playing golf, but those we met were very friendy and helpful."
6190,"The bungalows are wheelchair accessible with wide corridors, a great kitchen and bedrooms.  It sleeps 6 very comfortably.  I am a wheelchair user and its the best accommodation I have ever stayed in.  The grounds are great for my assistance dog who loves playing with Rod and Peggy's dogs.  Peggy and Rod are great and will go out of their way to provide equipment and offer any other signposting to services if they can not directly provide.  One of the bungalows has a ceiling tract hoist and they all have rise and recline chairs (I think).  As a family we have stayed in lots of accommodation and this in my opinion is the best.  Its a great base for loads of places.  "
6191,We accessed the building with ease but it was quite small inside so it would probably be difficult for a wheelchair user to manoeuvre about the room. There was one disabled toilet downstairs.  We couldn't access upstairs due to their being no lift.
6192,"There were no stairs and entrance was easily accessible for wheelchairs although the doors were not automatic.  The venue its self was very spacious and could fit several wheelchairs.
 
All the staff were very helpful and the cafe staff were also very friendly. 

The storytelling was enjoyable and the stories and songs were very good.

I would come again and definitely recommend this to other wheelchair users."
6193,There was no stairs until u get into your cinema screen but there a many ground seats for the disabled and there family's.
6194,"One of the toilets has an open plan, so is easily accessible. However, the cubicles are small. There is one disabled toilet which is usable for someone in a wheelchair. However, for a child with a complex disability, there is no space for a carer or two to toilet or wash the child."
6195,"I am fond of Diggerland. Unlike some theme parks, it isn't strewn with pointless 'wheelchair entrance' stickers where you can go in but not actually go on the ride. At Diggerland, if you can get your wheelchair up to the ride and transfer across with a bit of help, you're in. There are things which people with disabilities may not be able to do, but it feels like you can use your common sense and make that decision yourself."
6196,"Didn't interact with staff members because I couldn't get to the bar, however when our food came they brought the wrong order and it took ages for someone to clear our plates away. "
6197,"Small car park and a little undulating but doable.
Didn't try the toilet facilities.
Have been to the museum in the past which we enjoyed."
6198,"A large disabled toilet is situated in the cafe. Plenty of room to accommodate a carer and wheelchair. Well placed handrails, both fixed and pull down.
Clean, tidy and well looked after"
6199,"There is a big step at the entrance, the café has a good metal wheelchair ramp, I was easily able to get in, and there's plenty of room to move about inside. All tables but one are wheelchair friendly, just one table is a bit too low, but still usable in a wheelchair."
6200,There are allocated disabled parking spaces at the entrance to the cinema. 
6201,"A bit variable , some areas have reasonably even tarmac, other areas not wheelchair accessible. Rough and gravelly  & uneven underfoot in many areas.The cemetery is built on a hill, so difficult in many areas.
The Commonwealth War Graves are in an accessible area, but difficult to get close to some of them.
No seating within the Cemetery for a rest , but there is some seating on the river path , adjacent to the car park
The display of military vehicles in the adjacent  park on the day was accessible , with the seating next to the car park for a rest"
6202,"Was advised in the eye clinic not to use the accessible toilet in outpatients as there was not room for a wheelchair!
There is an accessible toilet off the main foyer, plenty of room etc. Only fault I would point out is that the toilet has only one grab rail at the side, and I need 2 to push myself up. There was one against the wall which wasn’t much good"
6203,We visited as part of a holiday in Aberdeen.  Any worries we had about how we would cope were quickly resolved by staff at entrance. Our arrival was communicated to the ticket office and we were left to get lunch before our visit and when we got to ticket office one member of staff took us to wheelchair accessible areas of the prison when we could not follow normal route.  He left us to do our own thing and returned to meet us during the visit to guide us where necessary
6204,Helpful
6205,Very friendly and accommodating.
6206,"For the first time EVER I experienced LUXURY and total ACCESSIBILITY. Gorgeous cottage with every comfort and disability aid you could want, either as standard or to request. All this without the faintest hint of clinical !
You have to visit, if you can ! Very popular so few slots free but can’t praise this cottages and it’s owners enough."
6207,There are disabled spaces just outside the gallery.
6208,"The shop is easily accessible by bus with bus stops spread around the city centre. Taxis can also drive all the way up to the outside of the shop if needed. The pavement and road surface around the shop and in York city centre isn't very wheelchair user friendly, due to uneven pavements and cobbles."
6209,Very helpful
6210,"Almost in front of the hostel on Elm Row, there are local bus stops (the Lothian buses sounded like accessible). There was also a bus stop for the hop on hop off bus (Majestic Tour, accessible). 

The hostel staff kindly called a taxi for us when we needed it, and it was able to park by the curb close to the main door, or on the opposite side of the Annandale Street when we came back to the hostel.

I don't know about parking options for passenger cars. 

My friend pushed my wheelchair quite a lot. The tiles of the pavement around the hostel are reasonably flat and it was quite smooth for us to travel that way. For example, the crossroads from the hostel to the bus stop were quite easy to get over, there was some waiting area for pedestrians between the lines, and there are traffic lights, so you will get your turn to get over the streets even though there can be lots of traffic.

We travelled by public transport to Edinburgh and the location of the hostel is quite good. The hostel is a bit downhill (and not very far) from the York place tram station, which is the final stop of the airport tram. The Edinburgh bus station is reasonably close to York place too (but just by the bus station, there is a short but quite steep hill). 

When we came back from the Old town/Princes Street direction, we followed Leith Street downhill to Omni Centre/Edinburgh Playhouse/York Place, and then continued slightly downhill towards the hostel. That was very handy! When we wanted to get to the other direction, my friend pushed the wheelchair quite easily to York Place, but if we wanted to get to Old town we used public transport to avoid steeper hills."
6211,"A renowned scientific society that promotes excellence and education in all areas of science. The Society hold regular, free public talks and an annual summer exhibition to engage both adults and children in recent scientific discoveries. The topics are ones that are frequently in the news, such as climate change, robots, etc and they are presented by knowledge scientists, from that particular field . The building has excellent disabled access and are very proactive as an organisation in assisting people with disabilities to access their facilities and events."
6212,All level from car park 
6213,"If you like cheese, you'll love this cafe. It's small, good for takeaway or a quick sit-in and has level access through an open door (with a curtain)."
6214,The staff were helpful and very knowledgeable about the facilities that they provided.
6215,Staff really efficient and attentive 
6216,"The nearest step-free tube station is Green Park: from there, go east along Piccadilly and turn left up Swallow Street. Zillions of bus routes serve Piccadilly and Regent Street.  Bond Street tube station is now fully step free, as is Tottenham Court Road (except you need manual boarding ramps to be deployed by staff if you want to use the Central Line at these two stations)."
6217,"Although I have no complaints about the staff, I felt they were also a bit pompous."
6218,"We now have another new cinema in town! 

BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM!!!

The Everyman is 1 year old and has 4 screens. There is accessible parking nearby, level access, a lift to the floor where all screens are located, hearing assistance and an accessible toilet. There is an identical fixed location for wheelchairs users in all 4 screens of the 2nd row [near the front] and to the left side of the screens.  So if like me you cannot move your neck backwards you look below the screen level and I am unable to visit Everyman at Stratford upon Avon.

I visited just after the opening and have discussed the wheelchair locations with staff but there is no choice and no reply from Head Office.  Approved Document M says there should be a choice of seating for wheelchair users but with steps either side of all 4 screens this isn't happening.  It would be easy to ramp one side of each screen - it is a long, low gradient level."
6219,"There was no parking near as this was in the town centre. However there was numerous bus stops outside the cafe in Stephenson square, Manchester."
6220,"Did not need assistance, however confident the assistance, if needed, would be helpful."
6221,"There was some confusion with staff telling us the wrong information about disabled parking and trying to seat us in a completely different section to what was on our ticket and what we paid for, but it got sorted. The amazing access and incredible show by The 1975 more than made up for the confusion."
6222,"Walthamstow bus station is near by, as is Walthamstow Central Station, which is step-free for London Overground but NOT step-free for the Victoria Line, which terminates here. "
6223,"Entry is free. The fossils, rocks and minerals are attractively displayed, explanations are easy to read and there is plenty of space to manœuvre between them. There are a few interactive exhibits, and a section aimed at younger visitors explaining the work of a geologist. 
A great way to spend a couple of hours, learning about the local geology. "
6224,"Stopped for lunch just beside A96. First visit we will be returning,  great service and facilities "
6225,"The accessible bathrooms were very easy to locate on each floor of the venue, and had grab rails, room for front an side transfer, and room for a carer, too.  "
6226,This pub has a RADAR key toilet which is a reasonable size.
6227,"We went to Restaurant Story last night. Fabulous experience.  Food was amazing but accessibility great too. Getting in to the restaurant was easy and flat.once inside, there is the best disabled toilet we have come across.  Close to the tables, very well appointed, very clean, plenty of grab rails and large space. Best score of any we have visited. We'll done"
6228,Very helpful and friendly. They didn't rush us at all even though we were taking ages.
6229,The Motel One is a modern hotel build within an old building. It’s very well located for the railway station.
6230," The disabled toilet  is spacious but it does not have an emergency red cord.
 See photo."
6231, Very easy access . 
6232,"New Caffe Nero chain in Quartermile, loads of space and various types of seating types and tables, "
6233,There is no car park and on-road parking is very difficult. There is a bus stop nearby.
6234,"The gardens have steep access from Princes street, but you can enter via the lifts within the National Gallery and the Academy. These take you to the Garden Café and out to the gardens. Much less hassle."
6235,Brunch and Brew had loos accessible to all. 
6236,"Both the easy chairs, and the sofa, were too low for my husband to get up from unaided."
6237,The restaurant is on a padestrianised part of the sea front. A taxi can take you to MacDonalds and from there it is a couple of minutes level walk.
6238,I dont know about the disabled but the main stream once were fine 
6239,Arriving and departing from the station was surprisingly good as a powerchair user. Assistance was on hand for both journeys and lifts and easy access was available to the platforms. The entrance and ticket office had automated doors and it was easy to see the arrivals and departure boards. The station is next door to a shopping centre and access into the centre of town was fairly easy.
6240,"I would question they know anything about Disability Awareness or Disability & Equality Laws, or been given any proper disability & equality laws awareness training!"
6241,"Really helpful staff except at the entrance in a queue reminiscent of passport control. Not easy either as a stick user.
Did not see any mobility scooters to borrow which would have been good.
Fascinating place, went two days as tickets last for a year."
6242,"All loos are accessible with plenty of room for carers if necessary.

They are cleaned and inspected as needed but, at least, once a day."
6243,"Most of museum and outside surroundings are on same level. Lift in use to mezzanine floor to view speedway and motorcycle collection, and long shallow slope to the café area. And a slope to the 'red room' / Ferrari / Bentley collections.

 Interesting collection of both desirable supercars, and exhibits of cars that your father or grandfather might have owned. 

Café also had good choice of hot food, snacks and drinks."
6244,"We did not have to use public toilets here, so cannot advice you, but bathroom in our room was very good, enough space to manoeuvre, grab rails and pull cord, clean and tidy."
6245,Very wide isles and front entrance to the store. Nice seating areas outside. Very well marked paving areas too.
6246,"The Farm has plenty of parking with wide spaces, close to the entrance which are suitable for disable visitors."
6247,"Parking is in the Tesco car park.
Blue badge parking spaces. Some misuse of these spaces but you can park in the parent and child spaces with a blue badge if need be. These spaces are close to the store.
Car park is a bit uneven so it can be a bit of a workout if you're in a manual wheelchair.
The entrance to the supermarket has a bit of a ramp which can be difficult if you hit it at the wrong angle."
6248,Excellent is all I can say
6249,most helpful
6250,Level access throughout. Lovely surface to roll along if you're a wheelchair user. All shops were open fronted on to the main concourse and accessible.
6251,"The buliding is very accessible by bus, has nearby parking and there are is also tram stops and waverley train station within 20 minutes walking distance.  "
6252,"There are two accessible toilets at either side of the food and drinks till upstairs. I think there would be enough space for someone in a wheelchair to transfer as well as having assistance from who they are with. You are only able to transfer from the left side of the toilet though as it is closer to the wall at the right.

These facilities are not suitable for my requirements though as I need a hoist which is only found in a changing place toilet."
6253,"Toilets are sign posted, they are situated in the Ballroom next to the Counter.  All Toilets are in the same area, Disabled Toilet is large enough for a carer."
6254,It was tricky to find on our first visit but getting there is easy.... if you know how!! My pals parked in the accessible parking at the Festival Theatre. You then exit the car park the opposite way - so away from the main Festival Theatre. There is also a bus stop right outside.
6255,Staff are great and friendly and dont over patronise. They are helpful and courteous.
6256,Excellent
6257,"Access inside the hub is great. There are internal lifts to take you between floors. There are wide automatic doors to enter the building and the corridor is wide enough to provide plenty of space, even when it's busy. However, there is a lip at the main entrance gate to get to the building, which might be tricky for some people.   "
6258,The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful in clearing pathways when the cafe gets busier.
6259,"Timpsons are part of the chain of lock, key, shoe and watch repairs  that have diversified into lots of other areas. I went in here after getting some photos done for my Euan’s Guide profile page. Having not broken the camera with my appearance, it’s always a cheery shop to go into and listen the staff who work there. As they are close to the Blind School they welcome and encourage pupils and their staff into the shop to touch, sense and small the various experiences in this shop. Quite brilliant, and completely experiential as it should be. They are a busy location which shows the popularity and justifies where they are situated."
6260,A friend drove to theatre and dropped my mum off outside the theatre door
6261,Level access Fromm the car park area with a hard surface all the way. Open rails afford a good view from wheelchair height.  The walk is fairly short at around 500 metres or so.
6262,"Staff on our visit varied - 1 guy was excellent, but another 1 wasnt."
6263,Happy to help!
6264,"no parking, but in Leith Walk on the main bus route."
6265,"One at the front door, near the bar. Quite far away from restaurant "
6266,"We stayed in a city centre hotel and I was able to reach the museum just using the scooter I had rented, but I want to say that I found public transport in Barcelona generally to be very good, with accessible buses and mostly accessible metro. Also, the street layout in the old town was OK compared to some other ancient places I've been with a scooter, with a reasonable amount of dropped kerbs and not too heavy on the cobbles."
6267,"Our accessible bathroom was clean, attractive and modern."
6268,Accessible WC easy to find. Well-equipped and clean. Room for a carer. Shared babychange facility. No Changing Places WC.
6269,"In the restaurant, staff were helpful on moving a seat in the times I did not feel up to transferring from the wheelchair.
We used the pool twice and found the staff to be very friendly and most helpful.  I had checked previously and the do have a hoist to get into the pool, as well as a disabled changing room with it’s own loo and shower.  All the staff we met were very helpful.  There is also steps with handrails to access the pool.  The Steam room and sauna had a fairly high threshold to get over. 
The Internet speed was fine and reliable and we understood having to log on after 24 hours. Reception staff were always attentive and friendly."
6270,"The reason for the half star is that once you are in it's flat, but that's where it ends. It had a tall step to bump Pauls wheelchair up and an extremely heavy door, had we known there were no disabled toilets we wouldn't of bothered. Once inside they had booths but only for people who were eating so, as we were only in for a pint, we were directed over to a high table with high chairs. So we sat at completely different levels while we had our pint."
6271,The disabled toilet at Gloucester rugby ground is okay. You may need a radar key. There are two handrails either side are you to use . The space is adequate
6272,There is ample off street parking with disabled bays adjacent to the High Street. 
6273,"There was a lift which was clearly signed. However, the lift we had access to was not very large. My friend had to substantially change his seating position to enter the lift and there was just enough room for him and his carer."
6274,"We have commented on the suitability of the above holiday accommodation having booked it for 2 weeks in September 2017. We have looked at it from the perspective of having a profoundly disabled son who is totally wheelchair dependent and requires full assistance with all daily living activities.

We feel that for those wheelchair users with limited mobility or those that require some assistance with transferring from wheelchair to bed then the accommodation is more than adequate.

For those who are less able and require more assistance Cosawes Barton is suitable and has the space to accommodate lifting / transferring equipment."
6275,Pauline the owner was very friendly and they managed to get a wheeled walker for us.
6276,"We made our way to the museum by train from Harrogate to York. The museum is located at the side of the train station, this was accessible by lift and a short walk around the corner to the museum. There were parking spaces outside the museum for anyone who may wish to travel by car. "
6277,"The food here is lovely, it really is one of the nicest Italian restaurants in Glasgow, but accessibility leaves a lot to be desired. Tables are packed in, there isn’t a lot of room to move around, the accessible entrance is hidden round the back and the toilets are hard to access. A real let down for a tasty restaurant."
6278,"Getting around the Spa and pool areas, and to see the outdoor facilities, are quite easy enough, on the level for you, and to get up to see the pool,itself, there is a lift available. We saw all we wanted to see, so no problems there for us."
6279,Level access from street. Small but easy access. Not much turning room.
6280,"As I was staying close by we just walked [wheeled] to the place. Market Street is very busy and parking is limited. There are bus stops close by.
"
6281,Excellent staff and were always on hand as soon as you needed them. Appeared at the interval to ask if we needed to be taken to the toilet and again at the end. 
6282,"Idyllic setting,four family size cottages converted to accomodate severe disability,andmoderately disabled.Maggie welcomed us on arrivaland explained additional facilities,Laundry;Meeting area,and Covid restrictions with spacious distances and sanitizer throughout.Good guides to use of all alectronic  domestic equipment,and contact for external services Social area spacious for power chair.Good outdoor and indoor play areas for children;Walks accessible for wheel chairs.Maggie willgive contact addresses for Carers. A very special Place for restoring sense of well- being "
6283,"There is no real signage to getting in to the building and there are 6 large steps to reception plus more steps when you get inside. Most people ring the bell and a member of staff takes you to the left of carpark and a door with a chairlift to reception level. However best way is to go to the right of the car park where the extension is ,which is the events and gym as it is flat with electric door and you go along the corridor to the lift up to reception and the bedrooms. Staff while helpful don't always point this way out which is much easier than relying on people. 
Once inside the hotel which is beautiful by the way, it is easy to go to the lounge, and restaurant which is big and spacious .Breakfast and evening meals are there. 
They have a few adapted rooms with walk in showers but if you  don't need full adaption , the suites on the first floor are very large , easy to get the chair around and have a view of the Minster."
6284,Parking right outside the door. We drove - I imagine getting there by public transport a whole other issue!
6285,There didn't seem to be any special arrangements for cars carrying disabled people; you just park in a queue to get on the ferry like everyone else.
6286,"Wheelchair accessible although a slight lip at main entrance, but staff happy to help. Plenty of room for wheelchair at table. Staff very friendly and helpful. Lunch delicious , special offers on at lunchtime. Tasty well cooked food. Toilets inaccessible for wheelchair user, no accessible toilet on premises"
6287,"This bar is owned by The Black Isle Brewery & has a huge selection of beers on tap. apparently the beer is great but i didn't indulge as i was driving (my wheelchair!) However I did have a pizza & it was delicious! i chose the vegan option as i'm a dairy free snowflake. Mum had the venison salami, so jealous, but to be fair they were both very tasty & good value for money.  The venue itself is  quite casual with lots of benches & old school chairs. There's plenty of space for a wheelchair. Staff are friendly & service is quick"
6288,Staff are nice.
6289,"The accessible toilets are a short distance in a different car park, there are no changing places facilities, but there are grab rails and it is fairly large in size. It isn't in the accessible car park, but it is by closely to drive to."
6290,4 disabled parking bays directly outside the tennis centre. Level access straight into the centre from the street.
6291,"though not on a main road, the centre is easily accessible on foot, by public transport or by car."
6292,"Good accessibility although far side by estuary is quite stony, Covid safe cafe and excellent wildlife viewing opportunities with sea water in estuary and fresh water in manmade lakes."
6293,Plenty of level parking space
6294,Must have car/van to reach. Lanes are narrow if not used to driving in countryside
6295,Wheelchair access is limited at this practice. If your chair is on the larger side this practice will be inaccessible.
6296,"A local theatre and community venue that often puts on politically apt and challenging performances. The Albany also helps support local young people to get experience in theatre, as well as hosting events like community gardening and a cafe."
6297,Peggy Porschen is a café specialising  in ornately decorated cakes. They have 2 branches Chelsea and Belgravia. This review is for their Belgravia café. 
6298,Staff gave the 'I couldn't care' feeling
6299,"The restaurant is easily accessible as there are no steps. However, there is no additional space for wheelchairs and therefore during busy periods it can be difficult when everyone leaves at once. For this reason, I feel a wider doorway may be useful."
6300,"Mostly out of site or busy working on the gardens, in the cafe or gallery."
6301,"Shop is large and well spaced out (but not in the run up to Christmas where they've fallen for the usual habit of overstocking and cramming things in).
The shop is massive and includes an Iceland, a SemiChem and a cafe as well as all your home decor and arts and crafts stuff. There is a lift up to the mezzanine  level where the arts and crafts and cafe is. The lift is really quite small for the size of the shop and is right along at the far end beside the escalator. If you have a very large chair you might struggle. If you are using crutches or a walker you might struggle.
Everything else seems to be well laid out and on level floors.
Very helpful staff. Disabled parking at the door. Automatic doors."
6302,"Not brilliant, apart from the large taxi rank by ""The Playhouse"" next door.  Public transport is good with regular buses to nearby Princes Street & Leith Walk. (Personally, I came by taxi and my friend - who lives in Bonnyrigg, by bus.)`"
6303,"Access to the house was via a long ramp from the garden gate, up to the front door where it could be a bit tight but I managed it fine,"
6304,"Not bad really.  Location wasn't great if you were looking for night life etc, but I just needed a place to sleep when getting my wheelchair fixed.

The entrance was level and had electric doors which opened into a wee vestibule, lifts to the left, stair to the right.  Reception was up on the 1st floor. Unfortunately there was a pull door to get to the desk, and we had to wait a little while as the receptionist didn't see us and there was no bell.  She was pleasant enough.

Got our key and set off back to the lift up to the rooms.  Nice spacious hallway leading to our massive room!  There was enough space to have a party, and the shower room was pretty big too.  The bed was a little low for me, but so comfy and the pillows were perfect.

I use a CPAP machine at night and struggled to find a socket close enough, thankfully the cord is really long. 

We didn't opt for breakfast included as it was almost £20 for two and seeing what was on offer I'm glad, it was all microwaved. There was a small restaurant next-door (it was shut for repainting) and a Subway too."
6305,"it was nice to listen to the birds,ducks and cars. It was nice to feel the patterns on the sculptures (leaves). It was an overall good sensory activity due to the sounds, smells and quiet environment. There were 3 students, with 3 support members accessing an activity for a personal development session from a specialist college in Blackpool."
6306,"Great experience overall - the staff were friendly, there was step free access to where we needed to go and there was a good sized accessible loo. There are also some interesting facts behind some of the paintings on display!"
6307,"Accessible toilet was really easy to find with the option of both a standard disabled toilet and a changing places toilet. The changing places toilet was really spacious and included grab rails, a closomat toilet, adjustable sink, changing bed, shower and ceiling-track hoist. Both disabled toilets were clean and well maintained."
6308, We got a train from Clapham junction to Victoria .  From there it was a five minute walk to the Goring Hotel.
6309,"There are 3 entrances to the gardens. The entrance next to the Old Fortress is step free and I think so too is the one in the centre. However the entrance by the children's playground involves a couple of steps. It's a level garden with quite wide paths, areas to lawn and plenty of flowers and trees. There are a few pleasant shady spots. In the garden there are reliefs of Gerald and Lawrence Durrell, as well as various bust and statues and a couple of ponds. There are nice view towards the Old Fortress and out to sea. Plenty of benches to sit on. There is a small children's play area with swings, but it wasn't noisy."
6310,There were ramps to access the building. Then lifts to each floor. There was an exhibit of an old printing press.
6311,There is a bus route and a few parking spaces
6312,"This delightful hotel sits in an area that boasts open countryside and woodland views designated as a Green Belt, while small leaved Lime trees reflect the ancient origins of its woodlands.
The Limes was standing here from the late 1800’s, , but the present family run Tudor style hotel was established in 2006 when Mr David Morris purchased the hotel, and with a 1.5 million pound project, added many more bedrooms, and installed a restaurant and bar, and developed the grounds, so that today we see a very nice hotel that stands in 6 acres of tended well maintained grounds with a cottage like olde worlde feel about its Tudor kept buildings that offers character and warmth.
You have free parking, with we believe 27 bedrooms that offer plain simple nicely decorated rooms, and pictures found on internet show that many have showers, with a small step, good sized well appointed modern beds, and most certainly clean and well looked after.
The bar lounge is a pleasant comfortable place to sit and enjoy a coffee break, or later on, a most enjoyable cocktail, which we can recommend, and the Admirals restaurant offers an extensive enough menu that will delight you, as you gaze across the garden view.
An after dinner stroll across the grounds to the far pool will Offer a pleasant experience, with a walk across compressed chippings on its pathways through well maintained grounds.

OUR REVIEW
Our arrival was easy enough after driving through open countryside and the gateway was a nice looking entrance, but husband not so impressed with the compressed chippings on the driveway. But there is a reasonable well maintained car park. (photo 1) while there are bays nearer the hotel entrance which disabled may use, (photo 2) overlooking a small pond and over to the Tudor style country lodge.
The main entrance was not clearly signed, so not sure how to get in, it has a pull handle doorway with a small tread to get over (3) and you pass a very plain small box like affair, just a practical reception (4) which leads to the bar, (5) always a focal point of attraction. We sat in the lounge and there are very comfortable and relaxing seats in the open lounge area  6) as you order a drink or two. While waiting, we looked into the Admirals restaurant (photo 7) which looked very pleasant and well maintained furniture (8) 
When weather permits a small terrace would make for a delightful break (9) or perhaps choose to sit on the lawn on the benches available (10). 
A pathway leads across to pass the marquee (11) and on towards the chippings that holds the path to take you across to the far pool, while the very impressive marquee holds promise of some delightful weddings taking place here (12) which looks inviting, spacious and well looked after (13).
Inside hotel, a nice small functions room is available for those special occasions (14),
However our special treat was to enjoy a cocktail (15) while we admired the open fireplace and wood burner (16) which brightened up the day.
A short corridor led to toilets (17) which are just basic and with minimal fuss (18).
After our cocktail we ventured outside again to view the bedrooms, located in refurbished cottages (19) before departing this delightful lodge. (20)."
6313,Has accessible bathroom and has one single electric bed. Dog friendly. Not all of cottage is wheelchair accessible. Steep slope into kitchen. Too much furniture in lounge but can be moved around.
6314,"The reception was quite small, and therefore during busy periods it was hard to communicate with the staff."
6315,No issues
6316,Small and grotty is the best I can say.
6317,Plenty of blue badge spaces at the entrance.
6318,"Friendly, accommodating, and helpful with (general) enquiries throughout my stay. They were engaged when we were asking questions about accessibility during booking, but they were also very worried about my father. I suspect that they haven't had a disabled guest before, and didn't want to let him down. My parents didn't stay as a result (as they erred on the side of caution), but this was due to the friendly concern expressed by the staff rather than unhelpfulness or hostility. I'm sure that they would now be confident to have us all if we came again."
6319,"We only saw ordinary men’s and ladies toilets, no disabled seen, and needed a long ride to reach them. I needed help to get back up a steep long ramp however, but Willing staff on hand as passing. I did not see grab rails or pull cords in the area of the hotel I was in
"
6320,The steep incline to the disabled ramp or numerous steps from the council car park lets it down.  Inside too cluttered but is need when busy.
6321,The toilet is easily reached using the lift. It was clean and had room enough for me to transfer over. 
6322,There's more than one accessible toilet. I used one adjacent to the cafe area. It was spacious and served its purpose; although I did find the doors tricky to manage.
6323,Staff are helpful but couldn't help much when it came to the store's hearing loop.
6324,"New wetroom being installed gave us a perfect excuse to decant to Homelands for a week.

We've been before but have never stayed in Massney.  It was as good as Cardy and Drummochy, where we've stayed on previous trips. 

Ceiling hoists should be fitted at home for everyone - they are so easy to use.

A good friend joined us for a few days and was impressed by the space and the sheer luxury."
6325,"The main entrance to the bar and restaurant is easily accessible by wheelchair. From here it is possible to gain entry to the venue through side doors or using a lift to navigate the few steps at the main venue entrance.

The bar/restaurant could become difficult to navigate for wheelchair users at busy times."
6326,We asked for help at the information desk. A combination of ramps and lifts. We were escorted along back corridors which was interesting in itself. The only problem came at the entrance to the Central Lobby which was too narrow for my chair so I had to get up while my husband semi-collapsed it and pushed it through. The cafe had 2 tables giving priority to customers with disabilities.
6327,"Couldn't fault it! We were very apprehensive beforehand as hadn't travelled that route on a match day before. We went via Glasgow Central and then Mount Florida. Helpful staff at each point. On way back the mounted police directed us to the accessible entrance to Mount Florida station (which also meant we skipped the queue - hurrah!). From Mount Florida it's only a short distance to Hampden. 

Re parking - a pal always travels by car and there is a decent sized blue badge car park at Hampden."
6328,"Those of us with memories of how The Astoria was before the refurbishment all agree it is now so much better. Warm. Comfy seats. But it could be so much better.

In the screens I've been to - 3 and 5 - the sound is much better. But the sound proofing is in adequate. Recently whilst watching Mary Poppins Returns there was a constant rumble from an adjoining screen showing some block buster.

Then let's talk about accessibility. Screens 3, 4 and 5 are accessible. They are not on ground level. But there is a wheelchair lift to take you down the equivalent of 10 steps. So far so good. But be warned, it is quite a walk to a disabled toilet on this lower level.

I first visited in November and refurbishment was still on going in the two upstairs screens. I assumed that to comply with accessibility requirements Reel would put in a lift to upstairs. Wrong! The two upstairs screens can only be accessed via the stairs. No good for me. (Ambulant disabled) Let alone someone in a wheelchair 

I queried this when I visited. The young guy on duty was clearly embarrassed. ""I'm sorry sir. All I can suggest is you contact us beforehand and we'll let you know if the screen is accessible.""

Such a pity. 

It's great that Reel cinemas have spent money on the Astoria. But its not a ""proper job"""
6329,The staff I spoke to were very helpful and offered physical help to get me up to the area for mobility scooters. They came and asked if we needed any other help twice during the performance.
6330,"I recevied excellent special assistance at Nice Airport, with the lady wheeled me out to my bust stop and then checked with the bus driver that the bus was going to where I needed to go. 

I took the 98 bus from the airport bus stop into Nice. The bus is accessible. The fare is 6 euros (2018) and you can pay the bus driver. I took the bus to Albert 1er stop. Its the first stop once the bus turns off the sea front, and the stop before is Congrès / Promenade. the journey took about 20 minutes. When I got off at Albert 1 er bus stop look in the direction the bus is travelling and on the same side of the road you are on, you will see in front of you an overhanging, blue hotel sign. at the first floor level and this is Albert 1er Hotel, see photo. There is a side street to cross but it took about 1 minute to walk to the hotel.

On the way back to the airport you get the bus from the opposite side of the gardens, on Prom de Anglais, directly outside Casino Ruhl, next to McDonalds which is on the corner, which has Le Meridian hotel on the upper floors."
6331,There is no automatic door at the hotel entrance and it is quite a heavy door but there are usually people about staff and members of the public to open it.
6332,Large dedicated disabled toilets that has everything you would need and was nice and clean.
6333,"The entrance had a very tiny step and was then step free. The restaurant is self service and there was a queue, that is why I have marked it down on access, as for me as a solo traveller it was quite difficult to manage this. There are free standing tables and chairs."
6334,Although the pool ticks all the boxes for physical accessibility the lack of information on the website and poor signage could be improved. my visits was as a spectator so I can't comment on the swimming experience. There's a good cafe called 'Refresh' and a wheelchair viewing platform to watch the swimming. The viewing platform gives a good view of the main pool and a distant view of the diving pool.
6335,There is a big step up into the shop. The shop has no ramp or other provision for giving wheelchair users access. I was unable to get into the shop. Zero stars.
6336,There are customer toilets beside the supermarket cafe and includes a large accessible toilet.
6337,"Entrance into hotel is through double doors, one of which was closed and I was unable to get through the one door so had to ring the bell for assistance and wait for someone to come downstair and Unlock the door. Once in, you're met by a staircase but to the side of that, you go along a narrow corridor and to the left is a small lift that takes you upstairs. The restaurant is located on level L (lobby).
The restaurant itself was very spacious with good space between tables."
6338,"5 star.  BSL options on most the videos around the museum, warnings when entering levels of low lighting too. "
6339,"The good thing is that it is free to visit, and it’s reasonably disabled friendly, with a lift and toilets.
Here you will see the history of Cannock Chase from its industrial start, it’s social history, domestic life, and of course wild life.
It has a gallery, toys and games memories for you, coal mining section, but what we liked was the two rooms as life used to be way back, with a very interesting 1940’s 
room, and a miners cottage can be seen. 
There is a sort of coffee shop, a little gift shop, and toilets.

Very interesting 30 minute or so visit.

OUR REVIEW
 We arrived at an open area of woodland and housing mixed and blended together quite well, with a large waterwheel catching the eye. (photo 1) leading towards the entrance for the small museum (photo 2) and down at the front entrance, two disabled bays are available (3) with a ramp leading up to museums entrance.
Pleasant staff greeted us and quickly explained a bit about what the museum is about (4) and straight away you can start reading history of the areas transport (5) 
Depending on how you can cope, a Stannah lift will take you up to the first floor, (6) or take the small lift (7). Personally we found it very small and only just managed to get chair and carer in, but still caught feet under a small ledge running across back of lift, and because you have to hold the lift button to move it, my husbands toes, (in shoes)  got trapped on the ledge and nearly caused a nasty accident, but just managed to pull out before really twisting his feet, so watch out for this concern.
Up stairs, we entered the coal mining section (8) with interesting enough items to see (9) and opposite in far end we found a disabled toilet (10) which although small was very clean, with grab rail available, just basic but good enough (11).
One room of interest was a replica of an old miners cottage with lots of memories for the rather senior visitors (12), and opposite this, another old living room (13) holding lots of interest for all (photos 14 and 15).
Real old memories are captured in the toys and games section (16) so all in all, not a bad little museum, well worth popping in if passing like ourselves.

After departing it’s surprising how quickly we found ourselves travelling along beautiful country roads, fresh green leaves opening up to herald in spring (17) with inviting paths running off into the woodland (18) ideal for kids and excitable puppies, but watch out for those spaces that have cattle in fields (19) but far distant views hold lots of interest for those fit enough to still enjoy walking (20).


OUR FINAL THOUGHTS
Worth a visit if you are passing, but would not suggest you go out of your way.
It was interesting but small, but did bring back happy memories.
The ride through Cannock Chase was very nice and scenic.

If we may, could we suggest following the route we took, which allowed us to see so much of the Chase itself.

From the museum, it’s sat NAV is               WS12 1TD,
we aimed for the visitor centre,  SAT NAV WS12 4PW
Then follow SAT NAV for Fallow Forest        WS12 4PS this is also Go Ape route.
Now journey to German war memorial.      WS15 8QS

Then set SAT NAV for your own next destination.

This trip will allow you to see so much, with places you may wish to spend a bit of time at."
6340,"The park is accessible and you would likely be assisted by the staff onto rides if requested.

We did notice that shade was limited and one lady did faint in one of the queues.


Note Disney do not offer a free fast track pass and they sell these freely to anyone so queues are pretty long."
6341,"We drove, parking is good - plenty of space for all.  Our wheelchair user son got a train to Hexham, where he was met by Calvert Trust's minibus.  He always travels that way."
6342,"Fantastic spot with great cocktails, friendly staff and wheelchair accessibility,"
6343,"The visitors centre is all on the flat and very spacious to move around. There is a cafe area for teas and coffees and exhibits to look around.

The boat to go on the wheel is wheelchair accessible via ramp and assistance dogs are welcome.

Each tourist boat can take up to 4 wheelchairs however it very important to book a wheelchair space in advance to avoid disappointment "
6344,There was a lot of disabled parking and plenty of transport facilities. 
6345,There were grabrails on the left as you sat on the loo plus a dropdown rail on the right - I would have liked an additional vertical one. The shower is wheelchair accessible and had grabrails to the left of the drop-down seat and a drop-down rail to the right -- see photos.
6346,"The main entrance to the building is somewhat tricky to find & is poorly sign-posted; essentially you end up circling the building to reach the car park, & there is an unassuming porch area that is easily missed. There is, however, an automatic door to enter the surgery in this sheltered area. There are 3 different windows where you can speak with various receptionists; make sure you check the signs & go to the right one, or ask if necessary. The windows are low enough to be reached comfortably from a wheelchair. The sign-in screens are to the right of these windows & can also be reached from a wheelchair. The waiting room is spacious, allowing for easy manoeuvring around the floor, & doctors come into this area to call people into their appointments. The waiting room is on two levels joined by a wide, smooth ramp.
The disabled toilet can be found just off the waiting room & looked quite small, but fairly clean.
Staff are friendly & helpful; don't be afraid to ask questions if you need to!
There is a car park for the surgery; be warned that there is a distinct pavement parking issue & limited accessible bays. Alternatively, it is on a main road with several bus stops in the vicinity. The pavements nearby are wide, smooth, & have multiple traffic-lighted crossings."
6347,Fantastic accessible parking directly in front of the entrance to the swimming.
6348,Access in was on the level and through doors that were open. Once inside staff were quick to move tables to accommodate the wheelchair users in the group.
6349,"The Museum of London was above street level from where I approached so was a little confusing until I discovered the lifts. I saw two at different sides of the street. They take you up to the main outdoor area where you see the main entrance. Through the automatic doors and the museum is modern with ramped access and lifts to all levels. Lots of space, with things easy to to see and enjoy from wheelchair height."
6350,Don't go to the main entrance on Maria Theresienplatz. The accessible entrance is at the side of the building on Burgring. Go through the archway. The reception office is on the right. He will phone through and someone will come and escort you across the courtyard and take you up in a lift to the main hall and ticket office. After that you use lifts to access all floors. We encountered no steps on floor 1 and very few doors and the galleries are spacious.
6351,Venue not accessible by public transport. No blue badge spaces but can park beside front door.
6352,Amazing staff.
6353,Disabled toilet at Twickenham is spacious. You need a radar key to use of the facilities to your need to ask a member of staff at the desk. There are two handrails either side of the toilet
6354,"There was an 'loop' system for those who required it.
The Foyer was quite small which makes it quite hard for wheelchair users to maneuver if there are lots of people in the Foyer.
Wheelchair seating at front of auditorium which was fine, & there was lift access to upper seating."
6355,Staff are very friendly and polite. Staff where happy to accommodate our requirements.
6356,There are two lifts that reach every floor in the hotel. Rooms and toilets are spacious for wheelchair users. The hotel is quite small and therefore there are not a lot of long distances to travel. There are no steps or problems with uneven ground within the hotel. The ramp outside that leads up to the hotel door is rather steep and wheelchair users may need assistance to tackle this.
6357,"The gym has key pad entry with an automatic wheelchair accessible door. There is an accessible toilet & an accessible shower room. There is a lift with manual door. There is an emergency evacuation chair on each floor. There is air conditioning. Music is always playing. 

24/10/2019: I have reduced accessibility score to one star as the lift has an intermittent fault which means me and my very heavy powerchair cannot access all floors independently and without worry. Pure Gym Derby are trying to blame the fault on human error and saying I cannot use a lift, but I have used many many different types of lifts and only Pure Gym Derby's lift has this fault. On top of this no one answers the emergency alarms. I cannot in good faith give more stars for a gym that tries to blame the lift issue on the customer. "
6358,"There is some on street parking available for disabled users (single yellow line) but it is limited. 

Local buses (29,24,42) stop on Raeburn Place, about 500m from the venue. Cheyne Street's pavements are narrow, however, so its probably better coming down Dean Park Street."
6359,"2 floors of this 4 floor house is wheelchair accessible - 2 person lift (wheelchair + carer) / kitchen & sleeping quarters are not, but during my visit a secondary guide talked about Georgian life, answered my questions and let me handle artefacts, while the rest of the tour party visited these areas. Note: Georgian doorways are wide, so no problem for wheelchairs. The tour is very interesting and well worth a visit if you & your wheelchair pusher/motor are up to it."
6360,Free disabled parking spaces beside the entrance. There is also a large carpark with pay and display parking. 
6361,"There is a double bedroom with an ensuite bathroom which has a shower over the bath and the other room can be configured as a twin or a king-size double and the ensuite bathroom is a wet room with just enough space to manoeuvre a wheelchair.  The loo in the wetroom was very high. Grab rails by sink, loo and shower. No shower seat but they provide one if you ask. There are 360 degree views of all the rooms on the website so you can get a really good idea of what you're getting."
6362,"Bridge Coffee is a community church cafe in Bolton, known as a great place for people to spend time together, have conversations and have some great food. "
6363,Such lovely people! Realised that we were passing through and gave us a map of the area plus a postcard. 
6364,"Despite not having access to the upstairs attic, there are still many rooms accessible for wheelchair users which is great to get a taste of Glasgow nightlife."
6365,The lady on the desk was very helpful.
6366,"Great! I use a manual wheelchair and there were no areas that were really problematic access-wise. Some of the slopes were a bit steep, but perfectly manageable and it was clear that a lot of thought had been given to access. This is a day out that I could do on my own with the kids."
6367,We had to park on the pavement outside the hotel until I got out & into my wheelchair.
6368,"I feel very lucky to have this as my local coffee shop, as it's mostly very accessible. There is a gentle slope down to the counter, as an alternative to the stairs which are also there, and staff are willing to bring drinks to your table when the shop is less busy (it does tend to be quite busy in the day, as it's a popular venue for mums with young children - for this reason I wouldn't recommend it in the daytime for customers with autism or noise sensitivity). 
There is a wheelchair-accessible toilet  as well as a separate toilet for non-disabled customers (a much appreciated step).

The one thing that lets this venue down is the lack of independent access into the shop. There is no automatic entry button for wheelchair users or others who cannot push the heavy door. I am trying to contact Starbucks to request that they pull out this feature for all of their locations."
6369,"From out visits, Chester Zoo is mostly accessible including the monorail, boat trip on the Islands and the restaurants. Pathways are generally wide and flat. Customer Service good. The monorail will discount carers to go free. If you ask a member of staff they will direct you to a separate entrance to the boat trip on the Islands where you can receive priority boarding if you have a disability and helped into the boat via a ramp if you are a wheelchair user."
6370,"We took the Ubahn, despite its age lifts and raised platforms have been added to help with access. Wait on the raised part of the platform and press the button on the side of the train to open doors. Platform level with train, no great gap. "
6371,"All the staff - guides in the rooms, members of the garden team, workers in the restaurant and shop, drivers of the buggies - were so kind and helpful. They just wanted to ensure we had a great visit and made the most of our day. "
6372,Most of the garden centre and three quarters of the plant section outside was easy for me in a scooter. The cafe was accessible too.
6373,helpful
6374,Decent sized accessible loo with all the other toilets in the main building. Someday I'll get into the habit of always taking photos of the toilet!
6375,"Bluewater could do better at putting disabled spaces right in front of the restaurant part of the mall, as if you just want to eat it can be difficult."
6376,"It is in the city centre, a 20 minute walk away from the train station, and there are bus stops a within a 5 minute walk away from the venue. There are also a number of disabled parking bays on the streets surrounding the venue for blue badge holders. Public transport is the most convenient and cheapest form of transport however, due to the location of the venue being in the city centre and limited parking."
6377,The Kelpies made for a great visit albeit a bit chilly as they're exposed to the elements sitting alongside the canal. They were easy to get to by car and you had a choice of parking. Getting up close and around was easy with good surfaces to wheel on.
6378,Parking was good with wide enough bays to accommodate our WAV (wheelchair accessible vehicle) and room to wheel alongside each side of the car. It was as easy roll from the parking to the visitor centre's entrance being only around 50 meters away. Public transport might be more of a challenge as the main road where the buses run was some distance away. Although we did notice that there were some tour buses operating that may pull into the visitor centre complex.
6379,It is street parking and residential parking in this area.
6380,"Booking office staff always helpful.
On the night  staff will do their best to take you to you seat and ask if you need any help. "
6381,Toilets on board are good.
6382,Car park is public and to the rear or there is street parking.  Bus stop on both sides of the road and directly in front of the restaurant.
6383,"If travelling to, or through Blair Atholl, I would recommend stopping here for a drink or a meal. Wheelchair entrance to the bar is to the right of the main entrance of the hotel. The main doors are quite heavy to open and there is level access to this quaint little rustic  bar that served lovely food. For the size of the place there was adequate space to manoeuvre."
6384,"It was great to find that the Cutty Sark was wheelchair accessible and even better to see how well this had been achieved. You don't imagine a boat of such years could be accessible. The staff can only be described as fantastic for the welcome, help and information provided during my visit."
6385,"I didn't have much need to ask for staff assistance, but all seemed friendly when showing people to seats etc.
"
6386,"Level access throughout from car to bathroom, everything is on one floor with wide doors and easily accessible light switches, sockets, and appliances."
6387,"Really good, clean, lots of space, grab rails, red pull cord that touched the floor."
6388,"Good wheelchair access, fair range of foods (McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut Express, M&S Simply Food, Noodle Bar, Greggs, Costa Coffee Shop + others). Open from 4.00am till 11pm."
6389,People around the town - in shops and restaurants - were exceptionally helpful. It seems that the good folk of Bath make an effort to welcome disabled visitors
6390,Second very clean and very good accessible toilet in 5 days. Large space. And plenty of bag hanging hooks. Clean and plenty of loo roll. Well done
6391,outside the gallery for cars and around Wakefield there is a free accessible bus that goes to both train stations and bus station. The new wakefield Westgate station is fully accessible but the Kirkgate station is being modernised.
6392,I don't think public transport would have been an option.  There was a lot of parking but I didn't see any allocated disabled spaces
6393,Two accessible toilets. One at the entrance to a small cafe next to the car park and another adjacent to the larger cafe. The doors are light weigh and the facilities are generally clean. The sink and hand towels are at the correct height as it the toilet flush.
6394,"Very helpful and friendly, keepers were doing talks about their animals too which was very interesting."
6395,"Sarah been showed us around where there hiding spot to watch the birds and seal.
Sarah also explains to everything.
she give me a trainee warden"
6396,You can park right in front of the disabled platform you are fishing from although it is not marked as disabled parking
6397,All the staff were friendly & happy to help. A special mention goes to Francis who went out of his way to help us. He had obviously been trained to offer help in an appropriate & sensitive way. We really appreciated his assistance.
6398,Parking immediately outside (hard standing).  Plenty of room inside although table layout could be better.
6399,Toilets have changing table and lots of handrails etc. The area is quite restrictive space-wise as a result of the amount of adaptations included.
6400,"What a shame, this oldish hotel is looking out of place, it’s very shabby, unlooked after, Badly in need of maintenance both inside and outside, and our first thought was to get out of there, but we decided to give it a review anyway.

This 1850 built 3 star hotel was once a gentleman’s club, with 
a very large car park, holding space for 120 cars, but we did not see a disabled bay, although there is 
supposed to be one here somewhere. What we did find useful was a hand cleaning car wash, at reasonable cost, and lads did a great job for us.
The hotel is run by Regency (Shirley) Ltd from August 2021, but they obviously cannot care about the place.
The hotel has 111 bedrooms over 3 floors, we would not stop here, a restaurant and a bar, with views over a garden, but this needed attention.
It has a fitness centre, built in 1990, refurbished in 2009, with its own leisure centre, with a well equipped gym, steam room, sauna, so they say, we did not bother to find it.

HOWEVER, there is a very pleasant, clean looking, small independent TEA ROOM, presented by Laura Ashley offering a good afternoon tea, and if the look of the hotel did not put you off, it may be worth trying out.
Now let’s present you with OUR REVIEW OF HOTEL.
We approached via a busy road, and entered the car park area, (photo 1) but that alone was enough to put us off, and the whole front of the hotel looked shabby and unkempt. The entrance into hotel was round the corner (photo 2) but not appealing and the woodwork badly needs maintenance and painting. There is a ramp though for you (3) with a pull handle entrance on the level (photo 4) which led us to reception desk, (5) with someone there as well, BUT DO REMEMBER TO REGISTER YOUR CAR here.
A corridor (6) leads towards the bar, which was plain and simple with a few comfortable enough chairs (photo 7) and served a decent gin and tonic. A good sized restaurant is available (8) comfortable looking with nice views over garden area (9) but the terrace itself needs cleaning up all around (10).
A passage now leads towards the Tea room (11) but there are steps to have to get up (12) even if you entered from the car park area, but it was a nice looking tea room (13) designed with Laura Ashley deco, in subdued colours (14).
Toilets near by with a disabled toilet, (15) which is small with basic facilities (16).
Around the corner from reception is a small lift (17) just big enough for chair and carer, but no room to turn (18) which will take you up to bedrooms, tired looking corridor (19) in at least an effort to add modernisation to it, but we did not see a disabled room.
Then it’s back outside again for your journey to next visit.

In no way would we recommend this hotel to you, it badly needs attention before we would even consider doing so."
6401,Didn't really have anything particular but they were happy to open both entry doors when necessary
6402,There is good disabled parking outside the entrance.
6403,Bus stop very close by that a number of buses stop at. I believe there is parking underneath the Omni Centre but we didn't use it on this visit.
