4,Olive & Cookie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is small and unassuming. It's not a big restaurant, more aimed at takeout, with a couple places to sit and eat. The food is showcased in a glass counter, and heated up for the customer. I was not sure what to expect based on looks, but it tasted great! The small pies were especially delicious :)"
