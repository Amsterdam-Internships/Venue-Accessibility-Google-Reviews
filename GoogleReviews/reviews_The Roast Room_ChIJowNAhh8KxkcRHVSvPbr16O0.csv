0,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great restaurant serving a meat focused menu in Amsterdam. We started with great beers and friendly service in a warm and atmospheric room. Lots of choice on the menu. The warm bread is delicious and comes with a melting cheese centre. The …
1,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A lovely little place to go for food in Amsterdam. My boyfriend and I visited the Roast Room because we are staying in the citizenM Amsterdam South hotel nearby and The Roast Room came up on there as a place to eat. The staff in The Roast …
2,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A great venue. We've had an a la carte menu, with fancy dishes. The service was very good. Modern and eclectic design, very good hospitality and attention to details. Keep up the good work."
3,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really stays a good place. Of course  good quality meats at good prices as well. Wines are expansive though. Good and friendky staff. Big place can hold lots of people. Very well decorated and lighted.
4,The Roast Room, 2 stars ,a year ago,"We went there as a group, and most of us took burgers. The normal burger was dry for me, but the vegan green burger was very strange and the colour didn't make us want to eat it. …"
5,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We have had a team diner here. Good quality food, reasonable price. Very kind staff. I ate the côte de boeuf. It was awesome. Definitely a must go when you are around."
6,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We went with a group of 15 people, so let me start with that. We were given a very limited menu, 4 starters, 4 main courses and 2 deserts. The steak tartare was super yummy and the meat plate appetizer we had was great and really good for …"
7,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Such a great restaurant! The quality of the meat is outstanding. The restaurant is very spacious. Downstairs there's plenty of room for drinks and bites. Upstairs is the more chique dining space. Reservation needed! The service is one of …
8,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good ambience, nice food and friendly staff. But it doesn't open on time. Overall experience still fantastic!"
9,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was good, can be different with big groups, which you regularly have because of the event location RAI next to the restaurant. My steak was tasty but over-seasoned, also a bit pricey for a shared starter, drinks and main course 60 euro."
10,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place close to the Amsterdam Rai. Food is good and prices are fair. They have plenty of space outside. We had the burgers with fries and it was very good. They also offer breakfast. If you're a bigger group you might want to make reservations. The place can get very busy.
11,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Meat was great, but portions are just to small for the price your paying.
We had the meat buffet for 2 people paying €27,50 each. Had sweat potato and coleslaw as a side dish."
12,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Very nice interior and nice looking food. And that's pretty much where good things end. Food is freshly made however the rack of ribs and pulled pork burger somehow did not taste right and meat was pretty dry. Also prices are on the higher side.
13,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was excellent, creatively served. Ordered a ribeye steak, one of the best we've ever had. Friendly, efficient waitstaff,  who spoke English quite well."
14,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good atmosphere and service. Reasonable quality. Spare ribs are dry, not recommended. Good rib eye steak."
15,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I don't know if it is the best meat place in Amsterdam (it does have a award) but it has a nice atmosphere and the starters are fine. The wine selection is extended. Most of the staff is very friendly and likes to make your time there memorable. It is a bit expensive though.
16,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Modern decoration, not too busy so fast service, good selection of drinks and snacks. Good place to spend the evening 👌"
17,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great steak! Normally take the Côte de Boeuf, which is amazing! Can highly recommend this place. However, the service downstairs can be improved. Takes a while to order and the forget small parts of the order."
18,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome cocktail and the perfect cure for my cold: French Tea.  A hot (literally) cocktail with a kick.
Steaks: I had better once, but still a great service and we had a good night …"
19,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, not cheap but awesome meat. Tender soft. Good service and warm ambiance. Good place when you are at the Rai to eat."
20,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was delicious, but the customer service isn’t great (as you would expect). Highly recommended though"
21,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Chill place with good food! staff is very friendly !
22,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Our food was amazing, it sounds silly but even the salad was so nice, it was nice to pop to the superb but very easy to get to with Google Maps"
23,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Everyone I've brought to this place have enjoyed the ambience and food. They make really good steaks and I especially like the little appetisers which are creatively done.

25,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best place in town if you are looking for excellent meat dishes and great service.
26,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Perfect place for a dinner during exhibition. Professional and very helpful staff, great atmosphere and tasty dishes. Only thing that  I could complain was a bit too long serving time."
27,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A very nice place for a lunch with nice decor and very friendly staff. I had the steak sandwich which was very tasty.
28,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Most wonderful place to have dinner - we ate outside at night.  The prices were good, staff were great and helpful"

32,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely spot for dinner, great vibes and friendly staff. The flavors are succulent and the interior is impressive.
I’d go here again for the chicken, it was a fun dish."
33,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service, delicious food and wine! Big 2 floors restaurant of high class which is rare in Amsterdam. We were with a group of 25 people, there was plenty of space. There is an outside terrace at the ground floor and another one with heaters on the first floor. Nice interior, attention to details."
34,The Roast Room, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Wouldn't give it another shot
The burger was ok, chips were stale and service was super slow (understaffed, 1 waitress over many tables)
Better alternatives in the area!"
35,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Although it is corona you get a pleasant welcome. It is mostly take away. I had a nice basic plate of half a chicken, home made french fries and a home made mayonaise wich had a very rich taste. The chicken had a marvelous smokey roast taste for what I got. To get food for takeaway better first to order by phone or internet."
36,The Roast Room, 1 star ,a year ago,"Horrid experience. Ordered online. Cold meat, the most basic coleslaw I have ever seen. A cold clump of fries. Way too expensive for what they serve, and to top it all off I got upset bowels from what little I did attempt to eat. Absolutely disgraceful."
37,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice and cozy restaurant. We had some burgers, brunch set and kid menus. All were very good and tasty. Really nice atmosphere. Service was also great. Will definitely be back."
38,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Great interior and very helpful and friendly staff. Good spot for lunch I would say. But the Roast Burger I ordered was very disappointing, it was way over cooked. Had to order the fries separately, which is okay. I wonder if the steaks are better prepared than the burgers. Too pricey for what you get."
39,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I was invited here for a business dinner. My dinner guest has impeccable taste, and he did not fail with The Roast Room. …"
40,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great place. Amazing atmosphere and their meat dishes are just fabulous.
41,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fabulous service & fabulous food! Adjacent to the Rai, popped in for lunch during IBC show, had the pulled chicken burger & fries, really tasty! Waiter was super friendly & super efficient. Lovely atmosphere & very busy. Will definitely return next year."
42,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A warm and elegant space with wonderful views to the outside.  Tremendous attention to details and continuity throughout the design and decor. Friendly staff. For Amsterdam, definitely better than average steak. As the name would imply, the …"
43,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A really great place to eat. The prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was great. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I would suggest the signature chocolate desert as it was excellent. Served in a mixing bowl with a spatula no less. A really pleasant quirky restaurant. I would definitely reccomend.
44,The Roast Room, 2 stars ,3 years ago,the food is amazing !!!! the meat was really great and good cook. Be aware it is kind of pricey (30 euros for the steak + 5 euros for the side + 5 euros for the sauce... but worth it). the place is nice but DAMN THE SERVICE SUCKS !!!! Rude …
45,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Really pleasant staff, and a friendly and airy atmosphere once inside.  Service is decent and personable. …"
46,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The roast room is a good restaurant. The prices are fair for the quality of the food. There is a big indoor area, as well as a terrace. The waiters are friendly and the food is quick to arrive on the table. They make delicious lunch (we haven't tried dinner and breakfast yet, but next time we'll go for the Œufs Bénédicte !)"
47,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We went for a Valentine dinner today. Had the Valentine menu, my husband had a 1kg steak! The food, the house champagne, as well as the wines and the surprise amuse were absolute superb, all of the best, fresh quality. …"
48,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We got there close to closing time, so I understand the workers wanting to rush a tiny bit. However, we had just walked to 3 other restaurants, all of which were closed earlier than they were supposed to, so we really just wanted to sit for …"
49,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious fine dining restaurant near Amsterdam RAI. Reserving a table at the 'Rotisserie' (first floor) is recommended. The service was outstanding; all the staff pay attention to detail and go the 'extra mile' to ensure everything is …
50,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Steaks were well seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium rare however, the real star was the side of roast vegetables! Only downside was how long it took to be served. It took about 45 minutes to get our food after being seated but the wait …"
51,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,4 years ago,With friendly staff and a great atmosphere this was the perfect setting to enjoy really excellent steak. The starters and accompaniments were delicious and beautifully presented. Four diners share 3 different cuts of steak cooked medium rare and ready cut for easy sharing. This is the best steak with a high-dining twist.
52,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing steaks and great and friendly service in a stunning venue. Highly recommended
53,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Recieved good service, although minimal. Had a really good lunch here."
54,The Roast Room, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"TLDR; skip the place, there are nicer places with better service nearby
The burgers were mediocre, however the beer and prices were reasonable.
My biggest issue was with the service. They have forgotten my drink order at …"
55,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We were planning to go to the Grand Cafe but it was closed on Saturday, so end up at The Roast Room. They serve bfst until 14:00 and was good. Very spacious unlike other cafes in Amsterdam. Food is good. You won't go wrong. It's also good for big groups."
56,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Warning, there are two restaurants here... Downstairs they serve burgers etc. and is well priced. Upstairs it’s an à la carte restaurant and it can get expensive.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table and were seated upstairs. …"
57,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good choice of food.
Breakfast menu extends into the afternoon.
Staff friendly and helpful …"
58,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a group of 7 and we ate upstairs on the patio. Great meal, loved all the little bites from the chef that came with the meal. Great place to take your team after a show at the RAI or customers."
59,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Just because of the location I rate it 3 out of 5. However, the service AND the food is not that great. One of those restaurants where you order a steak for 30€ and all you get is a big white plate with a steak in the middle. Service also …"
60,The Roast Room, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Staff not too friendly (at some point even asked a waitress if she was enjoying her job, b/c she looked so mad all the time), food nothing special, but most of all terrible service. Our group mentioned over three times that we only had …"
61,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is attached to the RAI so I did not have high expectation.  Expecting a typical, high volume, ""eat and get out"" kind of place. However, we had an amazing dinner.  The staff was attentive and they made really great recommendations.  All and all is was a 5 star experience."
62,The Roast Room, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I really wanted to enjoy this place. It failed miserably. We are older and was seated in a high rise bench in the middle, very difficult to get in. We ask for another seating, we were told it's fine you will be ok. So we struggled to get …"
63,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Steak is the best here. that’s the only reason I come. They have a fancy herb cart too, but it’s mostly for the amusement as they used precut herbs. It’s cute nonetheless. …"
64,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Starters were great - the buns and duck rolls. Took a Sharing meat plate which consisted of a piece of pork and two pieces of beef. Cooked medium rare and rare depending on a piece (asked for medium rare). The chocolate mousse was huge with …
65,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food was amazing. Really lovely atmosphere. Desert was yummy though interestingly presented mousse. Service was a little inconsistent as we had to wait a while to order desert. But overall good
66,The Roast Room, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Not recommended for large groups over 7 people. They don't give you menu, but offer only ""set"" for groups like a menu in McDonald's. Stupid policy spoils the first good impression of the place."
67,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Second try: better than the first! The burger with duck liver and truffle mayo was good. Good size, soft bun. Meat a little too much seasoning - would have preferred to taste more of the liver and truffle. …"
68,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Well trained and friendly staff. Big place. Feels un-Dutch. Good food. We ate at 9pm at which stage a number of the meat dishes were no longer available. The beer didnt taste the way it should. They should get different draft beers in my view.
69,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"For a start we had a very limited menu as there were 12 of us so we were not allowed to choose much, had to be 3 courses she literally only a choice of TWO mains. …"
70,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice eat joint....sadly due to fair at RAI a lot of the items on the menu and drinks were not available...you should not expect that.
Had the ribs with peanut crunch! A hit for my senses. Really tastful. the place was that evening too noisy for me though. Nice friendly staff."
71,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Food was okay but needs improvement. We were expecting a bit more for the appearance it gave. Service was very slow to start. Appetizers came out wrong but burger and fries were passable.The Pretzel was unsalted and they provided mayonnaise …
72,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place looks fantastic. Unfortunately the food was not of the quality you'd expect. However, could be easily improved and would be a killer location for a nice meat based dinner."
73,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food and excellent service. The atmosphere and interior design is warming and welcoming. The lighting in particular is just perfect! Loved the lights above the communal tables!!!
74,The Roast Room, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Two bad experiences out of the four times I've been there.

The first time, about a year ago, I ordered a burger asking for medium cooking …"
75,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,a year ago,Over priced with a similarly over inflated crowd. Good oudoor seating but people are there to be seen. Food is good. Staff generally friendly.
76,The Roast Room, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a quick coffee and breakfast with my colleague before going to the fashion event at the RAI, Modefabriek, today. Due to the sunny weather, we were able to enjoy our breakfast outside, which was nice. Decent food and drinks, nothing extraordinary."
77,The Roast Room, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Pity for the nicely decorated interior as the food itself was quite bad. Had the ribs but the meat was dry and the sauce was very sweet which made me regret the choice. Cheesecake was also tasteless.
78,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Came for a few late night drinks.  Staff was very blunt.  Drinks tasted very good but could use some more alcohol.  Very nice outside atmosphere and seating.  Would recommend.
79,The Roast Room, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Extremely slow service downstairs/outside. Been here several times and you'll spend 75% of the time with an empty glass waiting for service. Another 30 minutes before you'll have the check.
Food, drinks and atmosphere are great though."
80,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Crowded place because it is near to exhibition center. Food is good. If you’re attending an exhibition order the full menu on second floor. It’ll be faster than a sandwich on first floor.
81,The Roast Room, 1 star ,4 years ago,"the burger was ok-ish, service same.
It gets one star for the respect they showed us as customers and the way they made me feel consequently. i have been to many places in Amsterdam, this was the …"
82,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Got recommended this gem because rumor has it, the toilet facilities are the best in Amsterdam, especially during the rat race which is the IBC. I can certainly vouch for that after using them multiple times. Oh I heard the coffee is pretty decent too."
83,The Roast Room, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Where can I start?

I guess I'll start by asking you a question: have you ever gone out for a very …"
84,The Roast Room, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Amsterdam has the best water in the Europe. When asked for tap water, I was told off by the waitress that for hygenic reasons, the restaurant cannot serve this to me. This is very poor customer service. And the lady steak was fatty"
85,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The good was great, wines were good, and the staff was amazing. Except for the noisy table next to us everything was perfect. And the price was lower than expected, which is always nice"
86,The Roast Room, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Ordered half a chicken ask if it came with a side and the waitress goes on to tell me that its HALF A CHICKEN(like it was the size of a turkey) so I say ok, as it was is €14 for it. The dish comes and I swear it must have been a massive …"
87,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cool place, both for dinner and drinks. Cozy atmosphere and nice people, I would recommend it for a dinner with friends. Can be crowded, service is okay."
88,The Roast Room, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I would not go back here again, despite working just around the corner from this restaurant. We specially asked for tap water with our meal ""kraan water"" in Dutch which was brought to us in glass charafes with no lid, so we assumed this is …"
89,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We had the chef's menu and it was absolutely delicious! Highly recommended, super service in the restaurant as well"
90,The Roast Room, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Even though most of the people going there come for their meat, they have good and yummy options for vegetarians and vegans."

96,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Went for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. Good place for meat lovers...loved the iberico pork and the burger!
97,The Roast Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food for a place attached to a conference center. Stay awhile and enjoy the Dutch inspired cuisine. Not for vegetarians.

111,The Roast Room, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Cote de beouf is sold as 600 gram, but this is including a bone of 300 gram. 50€!!! Arrogant staff and unfriendly. The answer of the manager, this should be told by the staff, but they are all only 16 years old??!?"
