It's dark, loud, crowded and full of life and join. The food and drinks are also good, and they have some happy music as well."

4,Pata Negra, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Always good food and freshly made. The only BIG down, we were asked to leave the table because other guests were waiting to be seated. When we booked we were not told we had a eat and run run away from the table. W spay almost 90€ for the …"
5,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great food and great environment - the tapas were delicious ! Can definitely recommend the table of meats, manchego cheese and calamari"
6,Pata Negra, 1 star ,3 months ago,"very expensive! We order without knowing the portions were abundant. At the end, we paid full price eating only 20% of the food. The waitress should have told us. Empty pocket, empty stomach"
7,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"The food was really nice, the octopus especially. The staff was kind and professional within the informal setting this place is offering. The wine is really expensive, almost €9 per glass (I should have looked up the price before ordering a glass of wine, and next one…)"

12,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great experience in a shared table, top food, staff is welcoming, place is welcoming, no problem at all. Great!"
13,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very good quality Spanish tapas. A lot of variation and a nice selection of drinks. Good service. You have to sit on the bar if you are with two. Be early because it can be crowded.
14,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of my favourite places to escape the Dutch craziness and feel a little bit closer to home. …
15,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"The food was delicious, but the amount it not so much. I am attaching the bill that they gave me. Was a lunch for two people. Price was a little bit expensive. You can easily go to that place is near the Rembrantplain one on the main squares of Amsterdam."
16,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great local tapas restaurant in Amsterdam - the service was not just exceptional and well above the expectations for Amsterdam in general, but the food was also terrific and ambience was vibrant like a true tapas place should be. …"

20,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Food was amazing! Best tapas restaurant in the Netherlands. Gracias!
21,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The service was really quick and service minded. The prices was surprisingly affordable comparing to the quality of the food! They were probably too quick though, we didn't receive all dishes we ordered (they forgot one plate). It didn't  matter in the end, we got happy and full anyways!"
22,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great selection of food and great service - the food is great, taking me back to my visit in Spain."
23,Pata Negra, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"We booked a table at 3pm for 7pm, we arrived, no table. Reserved another for 8pm instead, we came back, no table. Overall was not pleased about this and had to push to get a table after waiting for more than an hour while it's pouring rain. Great food, but quite pricey."
24,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Ok~ish. Somehow overpriced tapas given the quality of the food; similar for the drinks. I will consider it a tourist trap. Service is very good though.
25,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Authentic tapas , a buzzy atmosphere and prompt service - the gambas are great but the jamon is always on point"

29,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"The service could have been a bit better, but the food we ordered was very tasty. I recommend the empanadas, calamares, and gambas al ajillo. The potato tortilla was not the best but it was not bad."

Really Good food, the people is very friendly. I love it!

32,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I love this place. Great food, good prices and it just has a nice feel to it. It's quite noisy and busy most of the time, but for me, that's just part of the ""experience""."
33,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good food, ordered by memorizing the numbers on the menu, in an overcrowded location with  acoustic qualities that force one to scream by way of conversation. Ah well, why not."
34,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I would totally recommend them, especially during corona measures. When i couldnt find them in thuisbezorg or ubereats, i was skeptical. However they provided the best home dining experience. They packed everything soo nicely, every detail …"
35,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Pros: menu offers excellent selection of tapas; beautiful and authentic decor
Cons: while some of the tapas were really good, others seemed to have been microwaved and taken out too early (lukewarm); waiter was unfriendly to the point of rudeness and seemed to resent the fact customers were there"
36,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,7 months ago,A cute little Spanish places. The prawns in garlic sauce and butter is a must and the green peppers
37,Pata Negra, 2 stars ,a year ago,"This is yet another overpriced tapas restaurant. Some of my food was really good (sardines), and some was extremely disappointing (patatas bravas). Overall, the quantity and quality were not worth the price. …"
38,Pata Negra, 2 stars ,a year ago,"I was here with some friends and I didn't like, unfortunelly. The biggest problem for me was the price. The tapas are small for how much it costs and the drinks were overpriced. They are nice tapas but nothing out of this world. We order a jar of sangria to share and we were impressed on how much it costed."
39,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Food was good, service a little off."
40,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is my absolute go-to tapas restaurant in Amsterdam. I’ve lost count of the times that I’ve visited and I’ve never been disappointed! The atmosphere is lively and fun, the food is delicious and the staff are friendly. I’m not sure I …"
41,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Lovely staff and sangria's unfortunately they didn't had the boquerones on a Monday
42,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Ok experience but wouldn't recommend.
Positive: authentic feel, lively atmosphere, attentive staff. The meatballs were tasty. …"
43,Pata Negra, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Food amazing but we order a small plate and they brought the big one and charged us for it even though we had no way of knowing the plate size. The ambient is noisy. There's no way you can talk with the person on the same table. Bathroom is …
44,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,6 months ago,It was ‘gezellig’! Worth to try the chorizo. I will definitely be back!
45,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Food is enjoyable. service is friendly.
46,Pata Negra, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Food isn't fresh, everything seems to be bought in supermarket and thrown on a plate.
The codfish and meat croquettes were 70% mashed potatoes + aromas, and really …"
47,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Last night here with my friends we ordered tapas and house red wine - that was cheap and so bad - will avoid next time.
My favorite was pulpo and roasted vegetables. …"
48,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The quality of the ingredients is very good! The ibérico was really tasty! But 2x they forgot our orders, and for 4 small tapas we paid a fortune."
49,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a nice team dinner here. They were friendly, sometimes slow with the drinks but the food was tasty.
They are dog friendly, but it is good to call in advance."
50,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Authentic Spanish tapas with Spanish staff. very friendly service.  Really like this place.  Sure, it sometimes gets crowded, as it's popular.

The crowd in here are friendly, and mid twenties to late thirties."
51,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Tasty selection of  jamón ibérico and other tapas.
52,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food and nice staff. If you want a quick bite you can ask them and you can have a warm quick [vegetables] dish in 5 minutes.
If you haven't reserved and arrived around 18:30 you might not find a table, but you still have the bar."
53,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The tapas we ordered were somehow too greasy/oily. They were quite small for the pricen as well.
Having lived in Spain I am probably too spoilt and expected something more of the food at this tapas bar. The service was quite good however and place is quite cozy too."
54,Pata Negra, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Not sure which tapas people here are saying are ""amazing"" or that its ""authentic"" because their food REALLY needs improvement. Sure they speak Spanish but thats as authentic as it gets. The sangria is not good, the tapas are bland and some …"
55,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,8 years ago,Fabulous tapas and great service. The interior is stylishly fitted out in a shabby-chic style. It is comfortably trendy. The chef takes time for his customers what makes the dining experience even better. I shall be eating here again and again.

60,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Long time favourite. Best tapas bar in Amsterdam, keeping standards high."
61,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The ambiance is great and the tapas although somewhat middle of the road well prepared. It was the to go to tapas restaurant for many years in Amsterdam and it has managed to keep a steady clientel. On busy nights you'll share a table with other customers, which is how we like it. No pasa nada."
62,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Super friendly service and great food. You can only book for a minimum of 4 people but we managed to get a place at the bar for two of us. Crowded but cosy ambiance and the food is delicious. Next time I go I'm going with a group so we can order more dishes!
63,Pata Negra, 2 stars ,9 years ago,"Expensive, and the worst ""tapas"" I have had. I was with a group of four, and nobody liked it (we shared our plates too). The fried sardines were soggy and undercooked, the salami had a plastic casing which hadn't been removed, the chicken …"
64,Pata Negra, 1 star ,4 years ago,Service is shocking here. On new years eve we ate their and they screwed up every single order and drink.  We had to ask about 12 times to get our drinks from a lazy waitress and server who did not speak English or Dutch at all.  The …
65,Pata Negra, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Really disappointed.
The food is pretty pants to be honest, with a really rude front of house manager, who goes out of his way to be unhelpful. Still tipped bc the waitresses are friendly."
66,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,3 years ago,An absolute gem in Amsterdam ! The food at Pata Negra never fails to disappoint and the service is great too. Value for money is excellent and the house red is not to be missed. …
67,Pata Negra, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice tapas place, portions are small and the food is quite fatty (much more fatty if you compare to an average place in Barcelona). Prices are quite high for the quality you’re getting, drinks are especially expensive. You can easily pay …"
68,Pata Negra, 1 star ,4 years ago,A major embarrassment. Had some good friends Over in town; so I just wanted to have them a superb great Spanish meal. I was mortified at the end of the night for having had chosen this restaurant for my guest's.  Reason why I make this …
69,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great tapas and friendly service although they could look out a little better sometime. Great sangria but you pay for it (€23,50 for a karaf).
Lovely atmosphere and big portions."
70,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Nice food and the service is friendly! Specially if you compare with other tapas restaurants. Prices have gone up too much and the quantity is the same.  That's why the 4 stars instead 5.
71,Pata Negra, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Wanted to eat here for 2 times already. 2 times I've been told that it's not necessary to make a reservation.
When I arrived here, the waiter came at me with the list of reservations. Wait, …"
72,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best, if not the best tapas bar in Amsterdam. Cozy and fun. A bit pricey compared to other places, but it's worth it. Friendly staff."
73,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Good atmosphere, has the typical retro graffiti-on-the-walls-and-tables-and-everything else style. Good for trying out many dishes while with friends. It gets extremely crowded on the weekend so expect lines if you show up at the door on a …"
74,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"* Good: taste of tapas was overall good (eventhough the patatas bravas were a bit plain and the garlic mushrooms did not taste like garlic), especially the grilled/fried cheese and meatballs were tasty, food came quickly, enough choice, …"
75,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is an amazing spot that known for their authentic atmosphere and amazing tapas. The building itself is very old with the facade looking like something from the 1800's, and the interior walls are covered with graffiti from past diners. …"
76,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,a year ago,"I don't understand the appeal of this place: overpriced, low quality food (gazpacho comes from the supermarket package for example) which has an ambition to be an authentic Spanish place. Usually crowded and loud."
77,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"only go here when you're very drunk and want to have food with a group, cause then it is the perfect place! very noisy, and way too much garlic, but well, for some reason, we keep on ending up in this place... so it must be good :)"
78,Pata Negra, 1 star ,4 years ago,"My husband and I ate fish soup. And then shortly after we started feeling very hot in the face then at the hotel we started to throw up, diarrhea and dizziness, We could not do anything the next day. Just lie in bed at the hotel. We wanted …"

81,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"very good spanish place ! inside decoration is nice, staff very cool and really spanish !!! there is some local spanish beer and genuine spanish finger food, so when you are tired of the dutch weather you can always put some sunshine in your plate : ) !"
82,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I only had better tapas in Spain. This place was awesome. Very good tapas and atmosphere. Worth every cent. And try the Sangria pitcher, yeah...! 👍"
83,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"A chatty, noisy and slightly run-down (on purpose) building houses this spanish tapas feeling restaurant.
The prices are not what you'd expect from spain, and most of the food is fried, …"

85,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great stop & reminded us of the fabulous food we found in Spain!
86,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,a year ago,"As Spanish as it gets (after Centro bankrupted). Mostly tapas. Inside and outside seating. Make sure you book reservations or to be there early, the place is packed every day of the week."

94,Pata Negra, 1 star ,4 years ago,"If you want to find the worst service in Amsterdam, look no further. We made a reservation for four people, and the place was fully over-booked. We were asked to go to the end of the restaurante and for 20 minutes nothing happened. We left the place."
95,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great tapas joint, good Sangria and a gezellig atmosphere. A bit noisy, and on a Friday or Saturday you want to get there early."
96,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"One little mistake in the order, but the food is very good ans the ambiance is very cozy. Could have a better beer selection. Good prices."
97,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Everything pretty good. It is real Spanish tapas place, not the typical tourist trap. But they should improve the Spanish omelette, it is a disgrace."
