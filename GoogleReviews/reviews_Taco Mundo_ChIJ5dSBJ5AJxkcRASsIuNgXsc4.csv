0,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,3 months ago,Honestly quite disappointed. It took 2 hours for it to be delivered (my address is 5 minutes away from the Oud Zuid location) and the delivery guy was also quite rude to us as well. â€¦
1,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,3 months ago,Published delivery time 45 - 65 min. But after 2 hours and 5 calls later to find out they still needed to start on my order! So if you are hungry donâ€™t make the mistake like I did to order from Taco Mundo Ceintuurbaan.
2,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"I ordered a home delivery and it took superlong, twice longer than the estimate they emailed me. The food was ok, slightly below average, not really fresh ingredients, not really awesome flavors. I got too much of beans and rice, too few â€¦"
3,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,2 months ago,"I HAVE ORDERED AT 18;12 TODAY SUNDAY JAN 9TH, TIME HAS PASSED BY STILL NO FOOD, I HAVE CALLED, SHE TOLD ME IT JUST FINISHED, IT IS NOW 20;20 STILL NO FOOD, NEVER ORDER FOOD AT taco mundo AGAIN!!! â€¦"
4,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Ordered 2 hours ago. Delivery guy is on it's way for almost 50 minutes now (the shop is just 5 minutes away). Tried to call, got disconnected because it's too busy. Is it scam night or something?"
5,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Classic tacos very delicious, sometimes delivery takes up to 1.5 hours"
6,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,a year ago,"Horrible service! Zero consideration or care for customers! Sadly this is not the first time nor last that they mess up our order, either half the meals are missing or it takes forever, when we called them they redirected us to Thuisbezorgd â€¦"
7,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Ordered through Thuisbezorgd.nl. We enjoyed the food and looking forward to having Mexican meal next time :)
8,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,3 months ago,WHAT THE HECK!!!! two hours waiting !!!!!! Donâ€™t order here is you are starving scammers !
9,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Unbelievable!, we ordered food online tonight. At 19:50 and we are still waiting!! Almost 2 hours! We called several times and they hang up. Played and no delivery yet. Not to mention my 8 year old is starving! I don't recommend anyone to â€¦"
10,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,a year ago,"Absolutely horrific.. bowl i took was no more than canned bean&corn, tasteless meat and tasteless guacamole with some packaged chips ( can't call it as nachos )... â€¦"
11,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,6 years ago,I order from Taco Mundo several times a year when I am at home with the boys only (my wife doesn't like it :-) I really like the classic salad and their nachos a la mexicana. Not the best food in town but a very tasty meal that is always â€¦
12,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Good for an emergency meal but there are better options out there. The taco itself was tasty but a little under filled. The fries were huge, enough for two people, and were standard fast food fare. The churros though were expensive for the portion size and very thin, greasy and chewy I won't be having them again!"
13,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,3 months ago,Ordered more than 2 hours ago and still waiting..
14,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,a year ago,"About as Mexican as an IKEA. Store bought and raw tortillas, zero flavor, just a mushy and disgusting mess. Avoid this chain at all costs unless you hate yourself."
15,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Hands down the worst Mexican food I've had in Amsterdam if not the world. I would recommend just cooking it yourself at home. Mexican food is very simple despite them messing it up so badly. If you've eaten somewhere like Taco Bell, this is â€¦"
16,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Barley OK.  I know I'm spoiled from growing up with great street tacos at my disposal all the time. But this place is a Dutch version of Taco Bell at best. It is very conveniently located and the food is good for what it is.
17,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"We actually ate at the store, so I can't say much of the delivery system. The service was good and the cashier was very helpful explaining what the food items consist of. â€¦"
18,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,This is not what I was expecting. When you hear about Mexican food you imagine sth tasty but this was far away from being delicious or even close to an enchilada. I do not recommend this if you know what Mexican food is about.
19,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Perfect for a quick pick up and go. Very tasty and almost Tex-Mex style. Didn't try the rice and beans so that will be the real test for my next visit.
20,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good soft shell street tacos. Really good for takeout. One of the few places here that sell Jarritos, so that alone makes it worth it."
21,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"we just ordered food from camping zeeburg  and we are missing a cheeserito with pulled beef and chipotle sauce ,wich we have already payed..we try to contact you by phone but there is something wrong...we would like it to bring it to us...thank you"
22,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Don't expect to get any authentic food here. This is a fast food restaurant, resembles Mexican food and tastes okay. The staff is good and quite friendly."
23,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,3 years ago,Ordered a burrito last night. Didn't taste too good. Have food poisoning. Disgusting...avoid this place
24,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I really like the Mexican food from this fast-food restaurant. It is very cheap, so I recommend that and the flavour is so tasty."
25,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good mexican fast food. The pulled chicken burrito and the pulled beef quesadillas are good.
26,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,From my first effective meal in Amsterdam from a long flight from the States it was nice to have some proper Mexican food.
27,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is really nice with quality. I really like the service. Its my favourite food. Thanks Taco mundo centurbaan.

49,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,a month ago,"(Translated by Google) Food is fine, order often, but I have to say that your delivery guys wear ugly delivery coats compared to the competition (think home delivery, dominos, big, getir) sounds like bullshit for nothing, but appearance is â€¦"

56,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Ever had some problems, but especially a very tasty varied bite. The Nachos a la Mexicana Classic remain my favorite, as well as the Enchiladas. In addition, ready very quickly when you pick up and very friendly staff â€¦"
