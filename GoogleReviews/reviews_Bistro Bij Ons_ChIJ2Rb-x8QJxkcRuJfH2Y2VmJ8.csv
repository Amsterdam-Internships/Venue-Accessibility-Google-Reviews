0,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Visited with some friends on my visit from London. They highly recommended this place and it's easy to see why. Such a relaxed atmosphere and lovely people. The dishes were brilliant. I had the 3 taster dishes which were typically Dutch and I loved them. Very generous portion sizes and an overall wonderful evening.
1,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing host, delicious food, great atmosphere. Recommended.ü§§üëçüèª"
2,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best dinner imaginable!  And a fun and lively atmosphere as well!  You cannot eat here and leave without a big smile on your face.  This was the perfect ending to our week in the Netherlands!
3,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The food was really good with a homemade taste. The host was funny, very polite and the ambiance was great. Try the beer if you can, it's made in house . It was very good."
4,Bistro Bij Ons, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff, nice Dutch food (we ordered the chickenschnitzel, clums, mushrooms and their special beer), everything tasted very good! Sexy decor on top of that, following the vibes of the city. The prices are normal, not cheap, not expensive."
5,Bistro Bij Ons, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Bistro with typical Dutch cuisine. The interior is not too attractive but few tables are available outside and it would be a good choice if the weather is fine. The only beer in the menu is crafted by the owners. Not bad but you can find much better in Amsterdam.
6,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had a great time and a delicious dinner here. The owner of the restaurant is a fun-loving woman who has a great personality and made the evening very enjoyable!

Brilliant food and atmosphere. Very friendly staff, a real experience of Amsterdam. Highly recommanded!"
8,Bistro Bij Ons, 2 stars ,5 years ago,We just wanted to stop for a quick snack but ended up waiting for quite a while. The food was good in general and the staff friendly. However with the kitchen being fully exposed to the dining area we smelled like fried chicken when we left.

20,Bistro Bij Ons, 4 stars ,a year ago,"We were looking for something down to earth and comfy, and came across this Dutch Bistro. As a dutchman myself I lived it. The Bistro has a lot of history and fun artifacts (go look inside!) and the owner has some great stories to tell. Service is good and friendly, food looked ok."
21,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food. Should try the 3 stampojds. Steak is great too
22,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really enjoyed it! I had the sausage with smashed potatoes and my boyfriend had a burguer with fries and salad. We had a beer together. Both dishes were great and it seemed like a ""dutch experience"" which was what we were looking for - ‚Ä¶"
23,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We walked past this restaurant often, and finally decided to give it a try.  Glad we did!  Our party of four arrived for an early dinner around 6:30pm so there was no wait for tables. The service was attentive despite a single waitress ‚Ä¶"

27,Bistro Bij Ons, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I went there randomly with a friend. It looked cozy when we looked though the window. It indeed was. Very friendly waitresses and cosy Dutch vintage (kitsch) decor. The food is good, not exceptional. They don‚Äôt have too much beer choices ‚Ä¶"
28,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The owner Carla was a lovely host. I had the Grandmother's stew, red cabbage, mash potatoes and apple sauce. When eaten a little at a time clockwise they really compliment each others taste (suggested by Carla). Service was great and the prices were very reasonable for Amsterdam. I think dinner and beers were <‚Ç¨20."
29,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,a year ago,"If you think that the only reason to choose a restaurant is the ""Kitchen"", well, I think you have to go here. The restaurant is small, let me say, intimate and welcoming restaurant. Already from outside you will be impressed by the ‚Ä¶"
30,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This was a bit of a find. It does not necessarily look promising but once you meet the owner you'll be smitten - great personality and sense of humour. The food was very well prepared, the atmosphere friendly and buzzing. Four stars for all ‚Ä¶"
31,Bistro Bij Ons, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Perhaps the food is good here. I don‚Äôt know. We waited at least 25 minutes to have our order taken but no one ever bothered to come over to us. I guess we weren‚Äôt the trouble. And lest you think the restaurant was too busy, the waitresses ‚Ä¶"
32,Bistro Bij Ons, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cosy little restaurant with really friendly, welcoming staff. We had the stampot tasting board and it was really good but we were a bit disappointed with the lack of choice on the menu, all the dishes were quite similar. There were no ‚Ä¶"

34,Bistro Bij Ons, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We stumbled across this gem of a restaurant whilst researching where Anne Franks house was. The food was excellent with a fair choice - I had a steak that was quite frankly probably one of the best I have ever had. The rest of the food was ‚Ä¶

36,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely cutest little bistro. The food was delicious and most definitely home made. The owners are incredibly kind and welcoming. I would recommend this little nook to anyone looking for a good meal in Amsterdam.
37,Bistro Bij Ons, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"I don't like leaving negative reviews, however this seems more like a quick tourist place. Staff are not particularly friendly or welcoming and the croquettes typical Dutch snack were not very good and I wasn't given cutlery either. The ‚Ä¶"
38,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent service and food, cosy atmosphere."
39,Bistro Bij Ons, 1 star ,2 years ago,Pathetic restaurant. We made a booking through google for 12:30. We planned the rest of our day around our lunch as its difficult to find a recommended restaurant without booking. They were not open at the time booked and they mentioned ‚Ä¶
40,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"A lovely restaurant with authentic Dutch food (to me at least), and it was all delicious! The service is friendly, and the food came out fast. The decor is cozy and comfortable, making us feel as if we were eating in someone's home. A worthy stop while in Amsterdam."
41,Bistro Bij Ons, 1 star ,2 years ago,"1. Horrible food. Reading reviews, i expected to have an amazing lunch. The food was dry, not tasty, this place is not worth the money I spent for the lunch at all :/ ‚Ä¶"
42,Bistro Bij Ons, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Went to this restaurant because I wanted to experience a simple Dutch meal. Absolutely not disappointed. Hearty, warm stamppot with a big meatball certainly cured this weary traveler's soul. However I was a lil jealous I wasn't given a ‚Ä¶"

44,Bistro Bij Ons, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"This place was so horrible.  Expensive for small amount of food and rude staff.  Didn't want to buy their water, wouldn't give us tap water, then yelled at us when we tried to drink our own bottled water out of our bag.  Said, ""it doesn't ‚Ä¶"

46,Bistro Bij Ons, 4 stars ,5 years ago,We will be forever grateful to bistro bij for literally finding a place at the inn on Christmas Eve for this family!  It was our good fortune to stumble on this place after visiting the Anne Frank Museum.  The proprietress found us a spot ‚Ä¶

49,Bistro Bij Ons, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A nice restaurant close to Westerkerk and Anne Frank House. We liked the local atmosphere and the outdoor area on the canal (Prinsengraght) bank, the service was good as well. I ordered Granny's casserole and my wife got chicken schnitzel. Food was tasty but potions were less than expected. The price was average for Amsterdam."
50,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food was really good and the owner of the place was so welcoming and pleasant to he around. The portion size are just right and the takes it's just on point.
51,Bistro Bij Ons, 3 stars ,3 years ago,A clean place (4/5) with an atypical atmosphere (4/5) with a good and fast service (5/5) but with no interest regarding the food we ate (2/5). The burger and a club sandwich (nothing local) were uninteresting and were not enough to recommend this place.
52,Bistro Bij Ons, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The waitress was friendly at first (when it was relatively quiet), but then all the staff started getting overwhelmed and started rushing around as there were more customers which in turn killed the cozy atmosphere. ‚Ä¶"
53,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious Dutch food and a jolly restaurant owner/staff who makes your experience enjoyable by helping you choose right and also explaining to you what you eat. Great place for foreigners to try Dutch cuisine!
54,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My mother and I visited twice in a visit to the city that was less than 48 hours long, for dinner and lunch. The first time we stumbled upon it while starving and a little lost. It was SUCH a nice experience, we went out of the way to visit ‚Ä¶"

56,Bistro Bij Ons, 1 star ,a year ago,"Tourist trap! Avoid that place! Execrable and patronizing service, ordinary food, stinky place, questionable cleanliness, loud music. Very expensive for what you get. At this price you will find much better in the neighborhood."
57,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Absolutely the best food I think I‚Äôve ever had
58,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great and tasteful! And Carla is wonderful!
59,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The baby pancakes were excellent!  Great friendly owners.   Quirky decor is worth the visit.  The other food looked great also.
60,Bistro Bij Ons, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very interesting deco and friendly staff. The food is mediocre, but I suppose dutch cuisine is not refined, but the atmosphere adds to the flavor. Highly recommended to try out some Dutch cuisine."
61,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very delicious traditional Dutch food , we tried 3 type of meshed potatoes and mini pancakes , it was amazing taste and the owner is very welcoming and lovely person."
62,Bistro Bij Ons, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Waited 2 hours for our main course, dessert was brought before our main then eventually when our main arrived my 'suddervlees' was over cooked or dried out. Not a very pleasant experience tbh. All we were given is some cheap shot to take ‚Ä¶"

65,Bistro Bij Ons, 1 star ,2 years ago,The staff was super nice to other customers but rude to us. The food was fair but my steak was tough! I'm sure that there would be better restaurants nearby.
66,Bistro Bij Ons, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice plates with delicious taste. The place is a little tiny, but the courtesy is excellent. Good selection of beers."

74,Bistro Bij Ons, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was meh. Ok bar selection. Wait staff had no people skills. Did not take credit, cash only. If you sit outside, you go inside for service."
75,Bistro Bij Ons, 1 star ,5 years ago,It took like 45min to get our main courses by a somewhat rude staff... Then no credit card was allowed despite the MasterCard & Visa logo perfectly displayed at their door. Food quality way below average in the area. I wouldn't recommend this place...

78,Bistro Bij Ons, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Basic eatery not set up for larger groups as we were asked to limit our menus choices to 4 dishes so that they kitchen could accommodate us. Group of 7
79,Bistro Bij Ons, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"You'll find all typically Dutch desserts and snacks here. There's an average terrace, nothing out of the ordinary. Except Johnny Jordaan, vanilla and strawberry ice cream. Worth a try!"
80,Bistro Bij Ons, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely atmosphere, delicious authentic food, friendly and funny staff. Would recommend for a quick, well-priced meal!"
81,Bistro Bij Ons, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic pancakes and location. Nice to sit by the canal and enjoy a bite to eat but the road can get busy and a little noisy at times with cars, the bikes aren't a problem."
