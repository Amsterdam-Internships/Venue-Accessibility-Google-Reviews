0,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,3 months ago,"DO NOT BUY FROM HERE.
All the reviews are true. No price mentioned. My husband was charged â‚¬35 for 2 portions!!!! The fish is absolutely tasteless. The experience really takes your appetite away."
1,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,3 years ago,Bad quality and overpriced
2,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,7 months ago,"(Translated by Google) I don't like to write reviews, but I'll make an exception for this one. Worst kibbeling I've ever eaten. Out of the microwave and I'm guessing about 3 days old. A 'portion' costs simply 9.60. No prices indicated. â€¦"
3,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,6 months ago,(Translated by Google) Portion of bickering is doing tough in my stomach. Spontaneous action is punished. Read reviews first. Microwave squiggles. Drama. Price for this failure .. 8 euros. ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤¢ Close that tent. â€¦
4,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,7 months ago,"(Translated by Google) To get angry, no price list, 2 small portions for 20 euros, from the microwave. Dirty sauce thrown all over the container making it even more soggy. No taste, no structure and no crispy. DO NOT GO! it's pure scam â€¦"
5,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,6 months ago,"(Translated by Google) Terrible bickering. Wow. 5 euros for 2 pieces. Chewy, out of the microwave. Gatver â€¦"
6,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,4 months ago,(Translated by Google) ridiculously high price (â‚¬ 8.45) for the very dirty weak microwave kibbeling â€¦
7,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,a year ago,"(Translated by Google) There was no price list and no one in line and that should have been enough warning. Ordered the squid anyway and as the other reviews say: reheated, soggy, tasteless and WAY too expensive. Do yourself a favor and go â€¦"
8,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,2 years ago,(Translated by Google) Pooh just â‚¬ 16 for 2 portions of bickering from the microwave ... not a good price / quality ratio !!! I will go to the fishmonger on the Maasstraat again. I think they saw me hear the tourist or something and then â€¦
9,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Worst squabbling I've ever had. Tray for 8 euros, and only 2 pieces can eat because the rest had become so hard by the microwave (!!!) that I would not even give it to my dog. Didn't know you could ruin squabbling â€¦"
10,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Very poor quality and price I just paid 4.85 for a kibbeling sandwich. When I asked about the price list, she said there was no price list for cod and different prices every day. The sandwich was not to eat.! I will â€¦"
11,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,2 years ago,(Translated by Google) Far too expensive (â‚¬ 10) for a portion of bad fried fish from the oven ... Then you better walk a little further to the kibbeling of Fish On South on Maasstraat. That is twice as cheap and at least two times better! â€¦
12,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) An absolute must. Especially for people without teeth. Nice and soft quibble, it looks more like squid. You do not even have to chew because if you throw it in the air and catch it with your mouth it will â€¦"

15,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,4 years ago,(Translated by Google) Avoid this fish stall. Bad quality rip off: 15.50 euros for two servings of squabbling ... from the microwave! Truly the dirtiest and snobbiest squab I've ever eaten. â€¦
16,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Very dirty squabbling. Microwave warmed and very soggy. 2.50 per 100 grams and there is no price list.
Do not eat here! â€¦"
17,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Absolute recommended. First I have to call 5 times before the employee will help me, she was only busy with her phone. Kibbeling is warmed in the microwave sauce with it and silver foil on it if you want to take it â€¦"
18,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,3 years ago,(Translated by Google) Gadverdamme. Not fresh. Stop kibbeling in the microwave. Too dirty. Then do NOT sell a quibble. You also do not fries fries in the microwave. And that man also requires serious money for that. That that stalls still â€¦

My God! â€¦"
24,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,2 years ago,(Translated by Google) Never paid so much for such a horrible gang (squabbling from the microwave). This stall should not have a right to exist. â€¦
25,Veen Zeebanket, 1 star ,5 years ago,(Translated by Google) Herring bought on Sunday and eaten at home. The Haring smelled very fishy and not good but I still ate with the result of a severe stomach cramp and the whole day on the toilet. â€¦
