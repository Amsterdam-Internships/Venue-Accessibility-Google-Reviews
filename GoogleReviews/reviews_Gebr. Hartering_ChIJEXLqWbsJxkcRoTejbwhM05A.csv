1,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,6 months ago,This was incredible! The service was very friendly and attentive. We also really liked the look of the restaurant. We had a lovely table in the back next to the window. The food was amazing.  We enjoyed all the starters but the pulpo was …
2,Gebr. Hartering, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Great food, ambiance and hosting. Fun experience for a family or a date night!"
3,Gebr. Hartering, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Maybe it was just the availability of seasonal ingredients, but much as I liked the service, I found the menu mostly underwhelming and not very flavourful. The veal cheek was good, and the cabbage was excellent but all the other dishes were …"
4,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice restaurant, staff is very welcoming and provide a lot of explanation. We were 4 (2 teenagers), concept is to get a plate for two which you share. Great ideal! Our table was on lower floor with a view on the canal. Food is great, …"
5,Gebr. Hartering, 1 star ,5 months ago,Below par dinner and felt deeply ashamed I recommended the restaurant for  the birthday celebration. Rude and disinterested service. The food was mediocre until the main course and the dessert arrived. Both of them being simply horrible. …

7,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went to this place based on a family recommendation and OMG, this was such an amazing food experience. Two of my favourites was the tartare and ribeye with wood fired herbs"
8,Gebr. Hartering, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A bit of a disappointment.
While the food itself was good enough, it still felt unspecial. Everything was fresh, and a few of the dished turned out quite good, like the steak, but the …"
9,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We visited as my cousin reccomended to us. Food was fantastic and service also. We will certainly visit again when we return to amsterdam.
We had the prime rib and they also brought some small tasty surprises out for us …"
10,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My wife and I spent New Year 2018 in Amsterdam. For the evening before New Year's Eve we wanted to find a restaurant where we could experience some of Amsterdam's finest local cuisine. …
11,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food and excellent service. We struggled to get through all the amazing 5 courses but it was worth it!

14,Gebr. Hartering, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, nice little restaurant directly next to the water. Also nice staff, but our expectations were a little higher."

17,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,So so so delicious! We tried the 5 courses menu and were not disappointed! Probably better to book 2 weeks in advance
18,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best meal I have had in forever! Make sure your reservation has enough time for the whole seven course dinner.
19,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A friend of ours recommend this place. It is indeed very good. We had the prime rib (2 persons) that was served on a bed of rosemary. It was amazing. We definitely recommend it.
20,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Awesome restaurant, wines were excellent and the seven course all good. Especially amazing what they were able to do with something as plain as oxheart cabbage."
21,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Terrific food, great Atmosphere and sublime service at gebroeders Hartering.  I really enjoyed the 5 course menu. Definitely will come back for more!"

Wow effect for the Ribs and the ice cream of the dessert."
23,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The food is amazing, very nice service too and probably the best place in Amsterdam for duck hunting"
24,Gebr. Hartering, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Food really good, especially meat. They have strange rules, a ""menu"" costing 60 euros has to be taken in two (X2) if you are two, if you go to a la carte menu descriptions are less than poor. Good food, bad approach. They sat us downstairs pretending it was full while it was not and downstairs is not so nice."
25,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good food and service as mentioned by many other reviewers. What I loved was the intimacy of the space, the personal attention by the waiters and the interesting wine list. Need to return as we didn’t have the beef on a bed of rosemary and after smelling it all evening I am certain this is a dish to return for!"
26,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A wonderful menu, knowledgeable waitstaff, and a  tremendous wine list made this a special dining experience. There was some real creativity on display. For example, the cabbage dish on the tasting menu was delicious - covered in crushed almonds and what seemed to be some sort of butter based sauce that was mouthwatering."
27,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very special place. This restaurant is all about the quality of the ingredients, and not about complex preparations. We had the seven courses meal with a bottle of wine. It was perfection from beginning to end. The atmosphere, the service …"
28,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful evening. The space was cozy and smelled of deliciousness. The fit us in, even without a reservation and we’re extremely accommodating and conscious of my allergy needs. The wine recommendations were incredible and each plate perfection. I will make it a point to go back here when I come back to Amsterdam again."
29,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is definitely the best meal we’ve had in Amsterdam. Let the server choose the courses for you, and you won’t be disappointed. Every dish was delicious, and the service was impeccable. To conclude the meal we had black pepper ice cream which was unique and wonderful."

34,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We joined for a late dinner last night and thankfully they were able to accommodate us. The rib roast is simply divine - unlike any type of grilled meat we've ever had. We cannot wait to return to try their other dishes.
35,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We've had a wonderful experience dining at Gebr. Hartering. It starts with the location, a very nice old authentic 'grachtendpandje' in the Old Center of Amsterdam, in a not touristic area. …"
36,Gebr. Hartering, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"In short: decent restaurant with good products and friendly staff, yet too expensive for what it is. They could do better if the kitchen pushed themselves a bit more and if the waiters were more knowledgeable about the wine. Extensive …"
37,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere, service and seasonal chefs menu paired well with a huge selection on wine. Careful attention to detail and cozy setting with a modern touch. Pricey menu but worthwhile."
38,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Top evening, food made with a lot of passion. Every dish that was put on the table was full of taste and craftsmanship. The RibEye was just amazing."
39,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,8 years ago,Fantastic meal on a Tuesday night in January. Had the 7 course menu and paired it with glasses of wine from the waiters recommendation. Everything was perfect. We were one of only 3 groups in the restaurant so that may have enhanced our service but it really was fantastic. I highly recommend it.
40,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Enjoyed a 5 course meal, each course was unique and delicious. The staff was also very attentive and explained everything. They also requested smaller portions from the kitchen because I was dining alone!!"
41,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Turned up quite late without a reservation and were immediately shown a table. The monkfish was divine, and plenty of it! Wonderful oysters and wine too. Very pleasurable experience."
42,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had an amazing time here on Saturday evening. Treated my boyfriend to the 7 course taster menu as a gift; it was fabulous and we were really impressed with the use of seasonal produce - I am still amazed by th3 grilled cabbage! The staff …
43,Gebr. Hartering, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"We had dinner in three and we went for the 5 courses menu. Food is good but not worth at all. The first 3 courses have to be shared, very easy starters nothing difficult or time consuming. The main course was okeish. The dessert? First time …"
44,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Outstanding dinner!! 5 courses of genius from the chef!! Wonderful staff and wine made a perfect dinner out. This was our best meal in Amsterdam for sure!! Thanks for a great night!!
45,Gebr. Hartering, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very interesting approach to revive some classic Dutch traditional. Good wine selection. As the house is old, in warmer days is gets quite warm inside. But I have been here multiple times and never had problems with it."
46,Gebr. Hartering, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Loved this restaurant's setting (make sure to sit upstairs!) and great food great staff great wine list. Did not give it 5 stars though because they take VERY long between courses
47,Gebr. Hartering, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious surprise dishes with great wine selection!
48,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This was the break from the frenzy of the tourist mayhem we were looking for. We arrived late, but was not chastised for it. The wine selection was wonderful. The 5 course was beyond expectation. The brothers were most welcoming. The atmosphere was perfect."
49,Gebr. Hartering, 1 star ,3 years ago,"RIDICULOUS

Mega expensive for what is. …"
50,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best meal you will ever get in Amsterdam. Let the staff decide for you and you’ll never be disappointed. A suggested wine pairing also goes along way in taking your evening from great to incredible.
51,Gebr. Hartering, 2 stars ,7 years ago,Was looking forward to this one. Great concept 7 courses of high quality local produce. The beef cheeks where outstanding but the rest of the food was slightly disappointing. Cote de boeuf covered in lemon and thyme. Boring creme brûlées. Nice location and setting but I found the food overpriced and a little boring.
52,Gebr. Hartering, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"With good service, a very extensive wine menu and original food pairings there is little remark to make. The only one I do have is the sense you are being directed into a particular choice. It is not as ""ongedwongen"" as I tend to appreciate. Other than that, solid experience and worth returning to."
53,Gebr. Hartering, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"It looked like a hidden gem, but appeared to be an overpriced hipster place that cared more about fancy names than well prepared food.
Decided to go for the 7-course set menu, as it looked great. …"
54,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a small meal here in lieu of 5 courses - the veal cheek was unbelievable. Very nice place for a special dinner, they will take excellent care of you."

59,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Eat here. Put several hours aside.
60,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely staff, warm atmosphere, good food. Just ignore my rating to keep your expectations in check, but I just cannot give it any less."
61,Gebr. Hartering, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Quality of English is good. The food is excellent. The four course menu of 55€ changes daily and is not overly filling.

64,Gebr. Hartering, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Expected so much and it didn't deliver. Starters were not great. Lamb was very fatty and the polenta and green beans not a great combination for me. Average experience.
