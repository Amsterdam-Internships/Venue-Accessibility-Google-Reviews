1,De Japanner, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The food is really delicious and looks nice. The Restaurant has a big selektion of different small dishes, so that you can order a bit of everything. It is a really good place to go to as a group, because you can share all the dishes. ‚Ä¶"

3,De Japanner, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Weird looking plates were delivered with absolutely tasty Japanese dish. I love that this place has an European atmosphere yet the dishes they have are authentic Japanese. I will deffo come back!
4,De Japanner, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Best Japanese food ever! incredible and surprisingly good! service perfect and really friendly and welcoming‚Ä¶ and wonderful and delicious food!!!!!
5,De Japanner, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Japanese small bar/restaurant. Choice of dishes is not very broad and neither are the dishes. This can be found back in their pricing which us quite ok. Cocktails however are terrible, very bitter. Service was not very good... all together would recommend it for a quick bite but not for a nice dinner or something like that."
6,De Japanner, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"This place is a must if you're in the mood for authentic Japanese small plates. We had the most fantastic sushi, top quality chicken katsu with a home-made tonkatsu sauce, fluffy pork bao and tender beef tataki. ‚Ä¶"
7,De Japanner, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great cocktails and small bites.

11,De Japanner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,DELICIOUS!!! This place really worth several visits. The dishes were very tastefull and original Japanese. The prices are extremely fair. The selection is not like touristic menu so I suggest you taste as much as you can. The place is casual and stays open til l300am
12,De Japanner, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Great food, slow service. Lots of choices for drinks, but the actual menu is quite lacking. A little bit overpriced, but the cocktails are amazing. Orders take forever to come, and they don't clean up the tables."

14,De Japanner, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food, good atmosphere and really friendly staff. The soft shell crab is delicious."
15,De Japanner, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I would definitely come to this place again. A Japanese drink place with decent Japanese snacks. We had gyozas, spinach with sesame sauce and squid fries, beautiful they were. Friendly staff but 4.5 stars given where it is and slightly pricey"
16,De Japanner, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Highly recommend! Amazing, delicious food worth a visit! The staff are very friendly and knowledgable."
17,De Japanner, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very dark, utterly noisy with loud music, hard to speak, priced as a meal, sized as a starter (‚Ç¨21 for these uramaki) but open until late"

19,De Japanner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Top quality of the food. But you need to order realy a lot to get full üòâ
20,De Japanner, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We had some expectations due to other reviews, but the food was rather greasy and not that fresh. Also the music felt quite random. The whole ambience made it feel a bit more like a fast food place then an actual authentic Japanese restaurant. Not the kind of Japanese restaurant I‚Äôve experienced at other places."

24,De Japanner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love it. Recommend it. Will come back, just for this. It is not traditional Japanese food, but it is even better. Served in tapas style, so it is ideal for a date. Always crowded, so book in advance. You won't be disappointed. I never was."
25,De Japanner, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Best Asian fusion place I've been in a while in this city, non pretentious and these guys actually know what they are doing. We were surprised with the chefs menu, and this was far from disappointing. Approx. 10 small dishes for 2 persons, ‚Ä¶"
26,De Japanner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love this place, friendly staff and good food. Some portions are bigger than the other, some are somewhat pricey for what you get. My tips are the miso eggplant and the oyster mushrooms. Enough options for vegetarians."
27,De Japanner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, great beers and great ambience. One of the popular eating restaurants in Amsterdam. Only thing is the portions are a bit small, that‚Äôs the only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a 5, you‚Äôll end up ordering everything off the many, twice if in a group."
28,De Japanner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy, good service, good food, great music. Cocktail something poison was very nice! We had a total of 7 dishes, with 2 people and that was plenty! Oh, and the price is quite not-Amsterdam!"
29,De Japanner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good service for Dutch place, international and local guests. Food is quite good especially spinach salad. A tip: if u order all the things on the menu in 3 u still spend less than the chef ' s menu that includes everything üòâ make ur counts, enjoy, thank me later ;)"
30,De Japanner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place is just a winner. Great Japanese beer selection and sake selection. Staff is super busy but super friendly. Portions are small and for sharing. Been here twice this week. It‚Äôs just cafe style but then A+ food. Great job and keep up the good work!

36,De Japanner, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Very friendly staff and they can make you a nice cocktail. The food was tasty, but not special. Good price for what you get.

37,De Japanner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I am not a vegetarian, but I would go back there just for the spinach salad with peanuts and sesame dressing, delicious. very nice eggplant, and great cheesecake with lime and yuzu. Will visit again soon!"
38,De Japanner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice selection of sake, reasonable priced, excellent service.the  Dishes where super tasty. I didn't like that the music was to loud and the tables are a bit uncomfortable."
39,De Japanner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great calamari fries, relaxed and local atmosphere. It is like asian street food with a bar pub twist. I liked the gingerbread man cocktail a lot. Uramaki comes really tiny so not really worth it but tastes fresh and lekkkkkerrrr! I love the manga on the wall!"

42,De Japanner, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent food in a izakaya-like setting. The menu is great and has options to everyone's liking. The staff is kind and very helpful. De Japanner is the best place in the Netherlands to grab an 'imo sh≈çchu' on the rocks!

46,De Japanner, 5 stars ,a month ago,The food was amazing!
47,De Japanner, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I do not think it should smell a mile away from a Japanese (read fresh fish) restaurant... Regardless of that I had some sushi there. Nope, the small was a good indicator not to go there"
48,De Japanner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is awesome, really lot of thought put in the recipes and it is delicious neo Japanese food.
The atmosphere is really weird though, with loud rap music, dimmed lights and loud people..."

56,De Japanner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the few good restaurants in Amsterdam city to offer food until 12.15am every night. Very friendly staff and delicious food.

75,De Japanner, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Hello, 2nd time in 1 week the noise was to much till after midnight. Please ask smokers to go around the corner on bilderdijkstraat. Dont want to call the police voor geluidsoverlast but will have to"
