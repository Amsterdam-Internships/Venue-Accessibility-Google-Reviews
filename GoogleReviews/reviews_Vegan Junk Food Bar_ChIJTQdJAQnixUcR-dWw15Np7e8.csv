1,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Every visit to Vegan Junk Food Bar is a joy. Great service and yummy junk food. If you are not vegan like me, you'll be impressed to discover the burgers are not meat - i had the Sumo burger which had both the vegan chicken and vegan beef ‚Ä¶"
2,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"This is a small vegan junk food bar. I didn‚Äôt like the sumo platter (2/5), but the burger was good (5/5). Prices are a bit high (3/5) and the French fries are really dry. Go to the larger VJFB in the cities, much more cozy and a bigger range of food choices."
3,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"I went there to discover the concept, it is indeed a vegan junk food place. Colors are funny although a bit too unnatural to me.

11,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Great place for vegans or even for non vegan people. The only negative thing about this restaurant is, that it is a bit expensive. Other than that we had a good time and enjoyed the vegan junk food üçî"

13,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great atmosphere due to the 2D effects. Nice staff and most important: amazing vegan food!

19,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing vegan burger with the special VJFB sauce (secret recipe!) + chips and a kombucha drink. The price is not cheap (it all cost almost 19 euro) but the taste it‚Äôs worth the bill and if you want to save some money you can decide to skip ‚Ä¶
20,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Tasted really good!! The place looks cool. So if you need some Instagram backgrounds you can go there as well ^^
It is literally vegan junk food. Keep that in mind and don't expect healthy stuff unless you order a salad."
21,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really enjoyed the food here. Prawns tasted so real! It's also full of some great art and decor and the service was great too. We did have to wait roughly 20-25 minutes though and it wasn't actually that busy (can't imagine how long you'd ‚Ä¶

30,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I visited the VJFB after some friends suggested it to me. As I was in Amsterdam I was excited to go and try their food. The menu is digital and can be opened by scanning a QR code on the table, this is something that I found very practical ‚Ä¶"
31,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The burgers, the fries, the service... everything is SO good! The loaded fries are a must! And the fact that everything is vegan is a dream come true! I took my non-vegan friends here and they loved it! I'll definitely become a regular at this joint."
32,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The greatest vegan burger you can get. Definitely will try the other options on the menu if they are just half as good. The double beef burger is just unbelievable, and what to say about those chicken nuggets and the bitter balls. Both ‚Ä¶"

35,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Such good food. The buns melted in your mouth, the food was crispy and well portioned. The chips were amazing and crispy but still soft.
Only thing I‚Äôd say is it‚Äôs a little bit messy to eat but I like that üòÇüòã."

39,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best vegan place in Amsterdam! Tends to get very busy, very quickly, so it might be better to try and go during off-peak hours. The service was quick and the food is beyond delicious!"

Friendly staff, excellent burgers."
50,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you were to look for a good vegan hamburger; look no further, this is it.
Delicious burgers and i can also recommend the ""bitterballen"" which are maybe even better than the real thing. If i remember correctly the other VJFB in the Pijp has a more varied and bigger assortment of snacks, but all is delicious nonetheless!"
51,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic vegan restaurant. I had the Sumo Burger (double patty) and the fries with the house sauce. The food is expertly flavored and served promptly.  The space does get quite busy, but there is outside seating, plus, the staff will even bring you your food if you're sitting in the green space across the street. Card Only."

53,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I'm usually not the bigges vegan fan but this place really tastes nice without any meat. My favorite was the Kapsalon where with the mix of ""vegan meat"", fries, onions and salat you don't taste any missing ""meat"". And the portion is really ‚Ä¶"
54,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Go here even if you're not vegan. They have plant based chicken and beef burgers! Very well crafted menu, I tried the black daddy chicken burger and Mexican bitterballen. Both great choices. Overall a very positive experience."

56,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is so delicious! We had to wait like half an hour but the waiting was worth it! We ordered a Chickenburger and Fries and it was so yummy! The Prices are totally ok, for example the burger for ca. 8‚Ç¨ and Fries for 3,50‚Ç¨."
57,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Never had a better vegan burger than here. Do try the chickpea fries and their own sauce. It's a must have. And they serve plant based beef burger that actually tastes like meat. Do try. ;)

61,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It was good, but all the fries were a little too crispy what made it not really great. Taste of the 'crispy chicken' was good tho."
62,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,AMAZING. I wish this place was in my city. The best burgers I‚Äôve ever had. Went twice for dinner during our quick stay in Amsterdam. Seriously delicious and reasonably priced (a nice change compared to the rest of Amsterdam). The staff were very friendly and the service was quick.
63,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"As a vegetarian, I wanted to taste the vegan version of the Bitterballen.

The coconut curry bitterballen was very delicious :-) ‚Ä¶"
64,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I had my very first kapsalon here! It is different to normal kapsalon you get on the street hence the price - I think it meant to reflect an upper standard/gourmet quality and price. However, it was super tasty and would definitely come back again to have another one."
65,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The name says it all. Absolutely delicious vegan junk food. Definitely worth a visit. Keep in mind there's not a lot of space inside so you might struggle if you go with more than four people.
66,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Horrible service. We had to wait for 45 min for our food! We didn't get our drinks, only after we asked for after 20 min. Worst was when people after us got their food before we did! The food was not as expected. The saus was under my food ‚Ä¶"

74,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Incredible food, the loaded fries are a must, the meatballs taste as if there was actually meat, burgers are good. As a meat eater I really loved everything but I just feel like the beefy patties can't really compete with real meat but still really good, will definitely be back."

Even if you're not vegan.
The burger was just amazing!"
76,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is nice and we enjoyed the food at the end.

81,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The food was absolutely amazing and service was great. It was very busy so maybe book if you can. You could sit inside or out which was lovely too.

85,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"This might be my least favorite VJFB.. There is no bar at this location, so no amazing cocktails (which we looked forward to after driving for 2.5 hours). Might be good to mention on the website!"
86,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is tasty and the service is super friendly. My sister is a vegan and she really loved the food--I did too! Order at the counter, credit or debit card payments only--no cash. Free wifi, password is on the menu. We had vegan burgers ‚Ä¶"

95,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"This Bar surprised me very well, they've got a great menu with a lot of different foods, I'm a meatlover and tried this because of a friend (also meatlover) and it was amazing! I didn't expect such a nice tasting without any kind of meat in it. As long as we are in Amsterdam we will come back."
96,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Actually ""Junk Food"" fits to what they give very well. Burgers are small, with nothing sophisticated inside only simple veggies and soy ""meat"". I think this place is overestimated. In that price there are many places with better vegan food."
97,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Loved it! The food is super tasty, beautiful to see, very well served! I really enjoy it."
98,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Saw Lucy Watson come here the week before I flew out, so had to try it and the place did not disappoint! Wish we had some good vegan places like this back home"

108,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"The food was good, but the waiters all felt incredibly awkward.

114,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,If you're Vegan and in Amsterdam you have to go to this place. The burger I had was the best burger I've had in the past 3 years of being vegetarian/vegan.

141,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food! The burgers are huge, so you can honestly split one with someone else. The ""Chicken"" burger was the best one we ordered. The atmosphere was very cool except the staff was kind of rude. Sit on the patio if you can- the little plaza it's in is very cute!"

143,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love Vegan Junkfood Bar. Yes, it is not necessarily healthy because it‚Äôs vegan but still, sometimes you can treat yourself! The food tastes amazing, is well presented and will definitely convince your carnivore friends as well. I personally love their burgers but I also believe that you can‚Äôt go wrong here!"
144,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is amazing! I really missed the taste of some things, like: good burgers and bitterballen. They have this and more. Great quality, great presentation! Watch out though, even though it is vegan it doesn't mean it is healthy. (But it is probably healthier than meaty junkfood)"
145,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow. One of the best burgers I've had period. The veggie blend they use is rich and delicious, the toppings are fresh and give the burger a good mouthfeel. The sauce is delicious and complimentary and even the cheese was just really good.

261,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious! It IS junk food, so we don't go there too often...but it is REALLY tasty. I particularly like the ""kapsalon""  ( loaded fries ). Highly recommended."
262,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Truly delicious vegan junk food. I had Sawaramah: bums, sauce and seasoning all tasted great. Took a while before food arrived on the table and had to ask two times for a fork though."
263,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Not really anything to write home about which was really disappointing as I‚Äôve heard such good things about the restaurant. I came here with high hopes, but the food brought to the table was pretty bland. Came with a friend and asked how she liked her food and got the same review from her about her dish."
264,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Our first time at VJFB but definitely not the last!!
We had vegan Bitterballs and the chicken burger and it was so absolutely delicious."
265,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"When you're travelling Europe as a vegetarian or vegan, it can be hard to find food options that aren't from a heath food cafe! Vegan Junk Food Bar is the solution! The loaded fries and chicken nuggets were tasty and  you have a great chance to try the local Amsterdam bitterball in a vegan form."
266,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great find! Amazing food, service and staff were really nice. Would recommend to anyone who wants to try great plant based alternative, vegetarians and vegans!"

268,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food! The burgers here are to die for. The decor is so fun and staff were friendly. Highly recommend!
269,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good tasting food, the vegan burger cheese was excellent and had an authentic texture. However, the food is a little overpriced for what it is."
270,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great menu and delicious food. Not enough seating or cooks for all that business! It was a bit annoying to see bag after bag leave for delivery while hungry and waiting for over 30 minutes.
271,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool concept, good (junk)food, but the place is usually quite hectic. Some of the servings (kapsalon) are pretty large, so you see a lot of people toss leftovers.. wasteful :("
272,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Vegan burger was great. I have never eaten this kinda delicious burger even with meat. it's also healthy. You definitely should try it.
273,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It is my favourite burger bar, taste like i want more.
Best fried sweet potato.
Highly recommend."
274,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice place and the food really good. In that place they don't serve alcohol. ‚Ä¶
275,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing service!!
The Italian girl with the dots is such a being of light, she deserves a promotion and all the good things of this world‚ù§Ô∏è"
276,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Is exactly what it suggests to be: a vegan snackbar. The food is definitely good and tasty. However: it is often far too crowded (people waiting for their orders among the tables where others eat); and it is certainly overpriced.
277,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The worst customer Service ever in my whole life. They make people wait outside in the cold, even though there are empty seats inside, just to make an impression that they are in high demand. This is the worst thing you can do to your customers. Corporate greed wins here, and you lose customers. Never ever going there."
278,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"F**king amazing, tasted like real meat. One the best burgers I have had and only been vegan a year"
279,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food, excellent friendly service. It is card only, no cash, but this made clear at the start. A must go for any vegans in amsterdam and anyone else looking for a delicious treat"
280,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great menu and a must visit for vegans as well as anyone that would like to try good meat-free food, can be busy but is to be expected with popular places."
281,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely amazing food. No need to be vegan either, wanting a great ‚Äújunk‚Äù meal is reason enough to go here! Make sure you try the fried seaweed as a side."
282,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Had the original burger and fries. Yummy!! Would highly recommend. Better than many beef burgers I've had. Cool tunes and good vibes. Get involved!
283,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really enjoyed the food but please, please, please can you do a burger without soy!? Not great for hormone balance. Love the chickpea fries!"
284,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place and especially the food( I know, that is what you are going to a restaurant for right...) is amazing. The stuff they pull of there with making the best juicy burger completely plant based is amazing!"
285,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Delicious vegan junk food. One of the very few places that actually serves a vegan burger that tastes great in my experience.
286,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great! The stuffed fries were amazing
287,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We expected a lot according to the previous reviews, however it was not that special. We recommed you to order sweet fries, those were amazing. Others were just fine."
288,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"5/5, became religious after that masterpiece of a burger. Took a long time to get the food but oh boy it was worth it. Reconsidering never leaving Amsterdam because of this tremendous culinary experience."
289,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food and wonderfully friendly staff!  We enjoyed tons of delicious food and we're so pleased that the whole menu was vegan (what a treat!)
290,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Out of this world. Fantastic decor, music, and atmosphere. The food is outstanding. The best burger ive eaten in my life."
291,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely fantastic. Shrimp, truffle chips, VJFB burger all sensationally good. Even a fire hard meat eater would not find fault."
292,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Really gross mega grease. More like 1 day old cold vegan McDonald‚Äôs, and who wants to pay 35 eurs for that? So disappointing it caused me and my gf to have a big argument about whose fault it was we went in the first place (mine, apparently)."
293,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Am not vegan but I was curious to try it, I was surprised. It was so good! The burger and the sweet potatoes were the best."
294,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,It is the best vegan food i have ever had üíú
295,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Vegan Kapsalon!!! This is so delicious!! You have to try this!!!

303,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, super nice staff and in a super calm area. It's really worth a try either you're vegan or not."
304,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,This place is over-rated! Its mostly self service (you have to order at the bar) but still the food took 40mins to arrive and was cold when it did. There was also way too much sauce on everything...it was rather disgusting
305,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a good place. For me there is a limit on once a year just because the name says it all - junk food :) Delicious and typically non vegans enjoy it as well.
306,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Waited for an hour for a burger and fries.
Which was just meh... The fries were unsalted too... üòî"
307,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Went there today (05/02/18) at 12.45. The place opened at 12pm.
There was a big commerical bin blocking the enterence and the door was locked.
Myself and 2 other people knocked and we were ignored. Went somewhere else in ‚Ä¶"
308,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food. Best vegan burger I've ever had! Also the non alcoholic Heineken is a low-key treat!!
309,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is great. A little on the pricey side but the portions are big. The loaded fries and the ""cheese"" rolls are just amazing."
310,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing, truly amazing! The food is delicious.
I came back the same day !!!! I was surprises actually it was that good. ‚Ä¶"
311,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Loved it here! Best vegan food by a mile! Well worth the little stroll to get to it! Your tummy will thank you for it!
312,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Yummy food at reasonable prices. The cook is an impolite excuse of a person, however.
If you‚Äôre not in the mood to be kind to customers, get another job."
313,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good vegan burgers, in a small restaurant (it can be crowded), prices were okay. A little bit ""fatty""/greasy, but I supposed it explains the ""junk food"" in the name."
314,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We are Americans who visited long ago and still remember our explorations well. Vegan Junk Food Bar was a highlight of our was experiences.
315,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Super tasty vegan eats. Minimal seating and super busy but if you're there during the day you can take your food over to the park to eat.
316,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best vegan burger I've ever had. Casual and friendly atmosphere. Would recommend 100%
317,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Hip transitional kichen and a great step towards more conscious food. An inspiring story of how your world can change if you start from within. Right after founder Edwin went vegan himself, VJFB was a bullseye hit from they day they opened. ‚Ä¶"
318,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good food, a friendly personeel and a welcoming bar.
It's a bit expensive for an every day quick stop for food but that's the only negative bit. ‚Ä¶"
319,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I ordered way to much because I couldn't choose.  Kapsalon was very tasty as were the Amsterdam bitterballs and nuggets. I definitely will come here again.
320,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It was realy nice. And the food was great.
I recommend this vegan food bar to everybody. Also to the meat eater, you won't tast a difference."
321,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The Vegan Kebabi here is unreal. Tastes much better than meat-based kebabs. Massive portions as well.

The burgers were the best order the sashimi and the sweet potato fries to go with it !!"

326,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was perfect! Great service. Will turn any of your omnivore friends. No cash payments was the only down side
327,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Waited an hour, had these loaded fries multiple times, but we didnt even finish these. I wouldnt recommend Vjfb staring plein. Not coming back"
328,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Extremely friendly wait staff and extremely tasty vegan food. Waiting times were not long at all, maybe 15 minutes. 5/7, perfect score."
329,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is good real junk and vegan :) I personally dislike the choice of including non vegan drinks such as Coca Cola or Heineken beer in the menu but the is also other vegan drinks, luckily"
330,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Finally we ate here, and VJFB lived up to my expectations and more. Amazing burger and Supreme dish. Will be back very soon!"
331,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good vegan [but not so healthy - It's still junk   ;- ) ] fresh food. Waiting time is frequently long, and staff can be a bit careless."
332,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Cant believe the other reviews that are on here. Maybe they have a nice review incentive in place ? Worst service ever, arrogant and unbothered.
Took forever to get our food too. The food was ok."
333,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food was really good for being a vegan. I think you could trick someone when you say to that it is a real burger. The only thing is that it was real expensive
334,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Service is great. Nice atmosphere. Food is really junky, but if you love it, than it's your place.
Only one minus for me: it's ain't cheep. I really belive that for junk food it's overpriced."

351,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"There were 5 of us waiting for service.  They were too busy doing nothing.  After 35 minutes of waiting we gave up ... Too bad, because we heard the food was great."
352,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Usually when you eat vegan food you want that to be healthy, but here the food is frozen, so not fresh and also very expensive. Staff rude and impertinent."
353,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food! Pretty location
354,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The burger was huge and tasty, probably the best I have eaten ever. Plus the fries full of veggies was like heaven."
355,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Always amazing to find Vegan food. üòä I think this place would benefit from a late night Vegan fast food place,who isn't hungry after lots of rum. üíö"
356,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I had to go two days in a row, I just had to. Had the SUMO burger, Seaweed Crunch sandwich, and the Pakistan Bitterballen. Everything was great. Might have to make it 3 visits in 3 days..."

364,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Yum yum in my tum tum. little mix up with the order BUT everything worked out in the end.  had their original burger. was the good stuff.
365,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Really just a burger place, food a bit bland, and you have to pay extra for ketchup and other sauces (except for the sriracha sauce) which is absurd. Not as exciting as one would think from the name."
366,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 2 stars ,a year ago,The food looked lovely but I personally didn't enjoy the meal.

371,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The name of this place says it all. If you're looking for light, healthy food, this is not the place. It's healthier than some for sure, but it is heavy, comfort, make you feel gluttonous kind of food."
372,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Nicely decorated place but quite overpriced due to being ‚Äòvegan‚Äô. Better off ordering a vegan dish at a regular restaurant then to go here.
