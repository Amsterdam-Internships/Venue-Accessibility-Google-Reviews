0,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Not much on sushi, but this place was great. Many varieties to choose from. This restaurant was set up nice, so you could watch the chef prepare the many kinds of sushi they offered. Plus it was a family owned. Would come again if in the area."
1,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I recently visited the Red Sun, for the first time. I wanted to try some new things and I did. Everything had a good taste and the server was nice. I'd like to try this place again some time. The best thing I tried was the Beef Gyudon. I enjoyed it. The pink sauce that came with the potstickers was delicious."
2,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,8 months ago,This is a great family owned restaurant.  The Ramen was awesome.  The sushi awesome.  Highly recommend
3,The Red Sun, 3 stars ,6 months ago,I've been going to Red Sun for about 2-3 years now and I have to say that I've had a lot of good experiences. The food is usually really good and the servers really polite. It's the kind of service you would expect spending $50-$75 on ‚Ä¶
4,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great Food!  Service is good but the staff can get a bit overwhelmed at peak times.  I absolutely recommend both their Sushi and Ramen bowls!  They are a small business so show them some love if you are in the area.
5,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tried The Red Sun for the first time tonight and was not disappointed! It's very clean and laid back, and has great music and friendly/quick service. The food is excellent! It's beautifully plated, the ingredients taste fresh and delicious, ‚Ä¶"
6,The Red Sun, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Considering the ratings on google, I was shocked to be served sushi this bad. I paid $13 for a roll that I would turn down for $5 at a gas station. Our edamame was served in burnt oil as well. Please do not support this business. If you‚Äôre going to make a living serving sushi, don‚Äôt serve trash for an outrageous price."
7,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved it! Stopped in for carry out on a calm Saturday night, and they even brought me a water while I waited. There's a nice selection of ramen options on the regular menu, and they offered me an expanded ramen menu that has classic ‚Ä¶"
8,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Excellent sushi. The sashimi was out of this world. We had a fantastic experience and look forward to many more.
9,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Hands down the only place you want to be for ramen and sushi in all of the St. Charles area. The owner and his son were incredibly knowledgeable and friendly creating a very warm atmosphere from the start. Our server Justin made things feel ‚Ä¶
10,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice new sushi restaurant on Main Street. Atmosphere was great, sushi was high quality, service was quick and friendly. Friday BOGO sake special is quite a value!"
11,The Red Sun, 4 stars ,3 years ago,There wasnt many people eating when we arrived on  Friday night at 7 which made us wonder but I'm so happy we still went inside. The food and service was excellent! People started filling the place and it was an overall great dining experience. I'm hopeful more people support this family owned business so they are here to stay!!
12,The Red Sun, 1 star ,6 months ago,"After going to this restaurant twice I wont go back. Both times, orders got messed up had to wait 40 minutes for the rest of the order with no discount. Host did not seem to care. He said ""uh I guess they forgot to make it"" would not reccomend. Ramen was cool everything else was not that good."
13,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Sis & I tried this spot for our sushi date...sushi was delish & my 1st time trying a ramen dish was great! Its not a big place but could tell the 1 guy at the sushi bar new his stuff & perfectly crafted every roll...& if I had to guess maybe 1 or 2 chefs/cooks in the back. This makes for carefulness & quality food & I love that!
14,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,a year ago,1/28/21: Updating my review to 5 stars! Staff is masked and food is still amazing! I'm so glad we went back to give it a try to see that the staff is wearing masks now! I got to safely enjoy amazing ramen and sushi!! Go get yours today too ‚Ä¶
15,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious, fresh sushi with some unique options. Excellent service. I look forward to dining here again!"
16,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Usually not the type to leave a review. However, this place is superb. The spring rolls were perfectly cooked. The spicy edamame was great. The ramen was the best part. The spicy beef was delicious. Definitely will be going back."
17,The Red Sun, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice small sushi restaurant in downtown st Charles.  New restaurant has basic sushi menu and limited  wine and beer list.  Food was delicious. Nice atmosphere. Lighting is low. Staff was friendly.
18,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Food was fantastic! Service was awesome! If your looking for a great ramen this is your place! Showed up with 9 and seated right away and eating in less than 20!
19,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing food. Staff was super knowledgeable and friendly. Made great recommendations. They have an option to build your own roll with a variety of choices. Salmon and yellowtail sashimi were the best I‚Äôve ever had. Our server Justin said ‚Ä¶
20,The Red Sun, 3 stars ,a year ago,not the best sushi but it was still pretty good. my friends did not like the quality of the sushi as much as I did though. Overall nothing special but nice atmosphere and decent food.
21,The Red Sun, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good service, good ramen.  Very nice presentation, I personally like a saltier broth.  I really like the decor."
22,The Red Sun, 3 stars ,a year ago,I got my sushi fix. I had the Orange Sun roll. It was good! üç£
23,The Red Sun, 1 star ,9 months ago,"The building is old obviously because it is in old Town st charles, but the smell of must when you walk in is overwhelming. The pork gyoza and seaweed salad were good. My husband had a salmon avocado roll that was mostly crumbly rice with ‚Ä¶"
24,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Just tried this place tonight (8/17/19) on a whim and glad my wife and I stopped by.  We had the red sun roll, the orange sun roll, and the salmon crunch roll.  All three were great.  Many places try to over stuff their rolls and make too ‚Ä¶"
25,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Ok so this place is great, it‚Äôs super cute on the inside. I didn‚Äôt sit in but I picked up an order (pandemic). The guy that helped me was so nice and so easy to chat with about ordering. This is going to be my go-to sushi place now. Such good ramen, sushi, and appetizers."
26,The Red Sun, 2 stars ,2 years ago,We ordered through grubhub and had it delivered about two blocks down the street. The order was correct but the sushi was warm and old. One of the sushi plates looked like it was just tossed into the container while the others were still ‚Ä¶
27,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great sushi and good ramen. Random Google find and definitely worth a stop in! My fiance and I had a mid week dinner date. The server was friendly, the music was good, the owner was present and nice. Definitely make a stop in!"
28,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,So good!! I loved the veggie ramen! Everyone working was friendly and I will definitely go back
29,The Red Sun, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a nice place to eat, but it has room to improve. They are working on expanding the menu, and what they have so far is really yummy. My friend felt that the rice fell apart a little bit. However what we tried we were satisfied with ‚Ä¶"
30,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Absolutely loved the vegetarian ramen option they had. The avocado roll and veggie friendly dumplings were amazing! We will be back!
31,The Red Sun, 1 star ,2 years ago,I had heard great things and was very disappointed. The ramen tasted greasy with no clear flavor profile. The egg was over done the presentation was sad. I've never left a bowl of ramen unfinished or at least not taken it home. I had about ‚Ä¶
32,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,First time here! Wonderful service by Justin! Great selection on the menu! I have a shellfish allergy and I saw the sushi chef personally clearing and cleaning his area to ensure no allergens contaminated my asparagus roll! The place was ‚Ä¶
33,The Red Sun, 1 star ,a year ago,Mediocre food and horrible service. The server was not attentive to any of the tables and had to be asked several times by multiple tables to have their water refilled because they had been empty for awhile. The man behind the counter ‚Ä¶
34,The Red Sun, 2 stars ,11 months ago,"The sushi was good but the ""mixed"" drinks were out of a bottle and the plates took 5-10 min between each plate it took 35 min to get all the plates for 5 people."
35,The Red Sun, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Sushi was fantastic. Beautiful presentation as well. You may wait a bit longer for your sushi to be prepared but it‚Äôs totally worth the wait. Cool indie rock music playing and spotless restaurant. Support small business and stop in. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.
36,The Red Sun, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Quality food and attentive service!  The plate presentation was beautiful!  Give them some love and stop by this small business!
37,The Red Sun, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Sushi was fine, the rice clearly isn't good quality as it was falling apart. Ramen was a good amount, but there was a large solid chunk on onion in mine, and the broth was very condensed and too salty. Also, they brought out each persons order seperately instead of all at once. Nice employees though."
38,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Always great food and get service! Love their take on miso, and the takoyaki is amazing. I enjoy the sushi also, but a good deal of it is a California roll base. Though I may not be the biggest California roll fan, everything else about the sushi is top notch. Definitely recommend trying this place out, they even have some ramen fusion."
39,The Red Sun, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Service is ok, the ramen is so horribly salty I don't know how anyone eats it. Beside the saltiness the flavor is bland and tastes artificial. Noodles were underdone and eggs were hard-boiled, not soft-boiled. Made for a bad experience. The sushi was also lackluster. I wouldn't come back here or order to-go."
40,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,a year ago,"First time going and we will absolutely go back! Salmon sashimi was so fresh, all the rolls were beautiful and delicious. The staff was so friendly."
41,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely fantastic place!  I love the specialty ramens and the hot sake. The staff was super friendly and atmosphere/decor is great.  I highly recommend this place if you are into Japanese food, or if you are looking for a new great place in the st Charles area."
42,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This was my first time eating here.
Me and my girlfriend came here for her birthday dinner.
Our server Justin was awesome, the food was delicious and had a chill clean ‚Ä¶"
43,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had never been here before, until my daughter took me today. Service was amazing!! We had crab Rangoon for an appetizer, the Northern Lights roll and then shrimp ramen. Everything was absolutely delicious and I WILL be back!!! Thank you Red Sun for a great experience!!!"
44,The Red Sun, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good asian food. Sushi was great. Small and quaint.  Won't break the bank. Two can eat for under $30 no problem. Nice enough for date night. Wouldn't feel out of place if you decided to dress up but relaxed enough to show up in jeans and a t-shirt.
45,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best ramen we have had in St Louis so far. We do ask for chili oil and chili paste, to spice it up.  We enjoyed their spicy tuna roll."
46,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Ate here and it was very good Sushi.   Plating was good and the rolls I had were very good.  Seemed like they were still figuring out the Saki as a few options were just not available on a Monday when I was there.  A fun twist at the end, you can shake dice for a chance to reduce your bill."
47,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Sushi was very good. Pricing very reasonable. Clean place with good modern decor. They have fun specials! As far as unique tolls go the hello Kitty and mango roll are excellent choices. I highly recommend! ‚Ä¶
48,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food was very good. Ordered Beef Gyudon and was not disappointed
49,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice little local place. Tried the edamame, spicy salmon roll, crunch roll, and tiger roll. I would not do the crunch roll again, it was not very good at all. I would do the rest again however, especially the edamame and tiger roll. Tuesday ‚Ä¶"
50,The Red Sun, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"The sushi cost a little more here than most places we visit, but it was extremely delicious."
51,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"St. Charles FINALLY got a new sushi place. Wasabi and Sushi Ai aren't the only ones in town now. Pros: I have room to sit comfortably and the place has a wonderful look and feel. The construction is obviously new so everything seems sharp, ‚Ä¶"
52,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very friendly staff. Prompt Service. Delicious ramen and sushi. Wine is very reasonably priced. Highly recommend if you're looking for a great lunch or dinner meal! We will be going back!
53,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I tried the orange sun sushi and it was excellent.  The staff was very friendly and was very knowledgeable with their menu. Will definitely revisit there soon.   Thank you for an awesome meal!
54,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Sushi was fantastic and fresh. Wonderful service as well!

59,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My goto for Sushi. Ramin is really good, but the Northern Lights Sushi is the best I have ever had! Off menu, but you won't be disappointed!"
60,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing! Understaffed but our waiter worked tirelessly to make sure everyone was helped expeditiously. Incredible shrimp rolls and great ramen. We will be back!
61,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"We ordered 6 different items from the menu, including tempura, ramen and sushi...all delicious."
62,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,a year ago,The best ramen I‚Äôve had in the St. Louis area. The gyoza is great too and my husband said the red sun sushi is the best sushi he‚Äôs ever had.
63,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went to The Red Sun this evening for dinner. It was excellent. Loved the music, loved how laid back and clean it was, and the service and food were excellent. I had the chef choose based off a few pikes and the rolls were very good. Highly recommend."
64,The Red Sun, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food average, service average.  The sushi felt apart when trying to use chopsticks and our margarita was made from mixes (as was many of their drinks) and for some reason salt was put IN the  glass which made the margarita extremely ‚Ä¶"
65,The Red Sun, 3 stars ,11 months ago,Food was ok but it took forever and it was one at a time. Got the sushi before the appetizers and then waited awhile to get other dishes.
66,The Red Sun, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The Russian owners were gracious but the  flash frozen sushi served basically unthawed was very wrong, ive had Sushi since the late 70's in Japanese communities. STAY AWAY"
67,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It has amazing food!! First time there tonight, it was great! Pretty good price as well. Would highly reccomend.  I plan on going there again."
68,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent sushi! Very good food and usually not crowded. Great place to go. Much better than wasabi.
69,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I've eaten sushi at The Red Sun twice. The food and atmosphere are great. I'm going back today to try the ramen. ‚Ä¶
70,The Red Sun, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The sushi toppings were WAY too cold, and it threw off the taste. Service was very slow even though it was empty, and the mochi seemed old."
71,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Justin was absolutely amazing! I came for my birthday dinner and was beyond amazed with everything. The service and food was stellar, this place just became a regular spot üòä"
72,The Red Sun, 2 stars ,a year ago,Service was not bad but also not good. Food was decent. Everything took a long time even though there was only one other couple in the restaurant.
73,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good sushi and ramen, friendly staff, and the ramen themed movie posters on the wall were a nice touch. My favorite was the Matrix one."
74,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Moving to Pennsylvania,  so will miss this new gem in St Charles...love Justin the server too. Try the Hello Kitty and get the Mochi Ice Cream..worth it!"
75,The Red Sun, 1 star ,2 years ago,"gross salty ramen, not fresh ingredients. A shame, really. Main Street needed a good sushi place. This isn't it."
76,The Red Sun, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the ramen which was great, but will certainly come back for the sushi which looked fantastic."

85,The Red Sun, 2 stars ,2 years ago,It's marketed as a sushi restaurant and the sushi is pretty subpar. I do highly recommend the ramen.
