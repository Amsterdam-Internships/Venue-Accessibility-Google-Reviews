17,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,11 months ago,The staff here is fantastic and karaoke night happens three nights a week which is all kinds of fun!

18,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"This place is one of my favorite bars in King County! It's got a very friendly ""airspace"" if you know what I'm talking about. I'd call it one notch higher than a dive bar and nothing fancy. The crowd is anywhere from hardcore blue collar up …"

33,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,First time at this Sports Bar last night and I have to say I was thoroughly impressed. The bar staff made sure to check our ID's. The people here were friendly. Parking wasn't a problem for us. Karaoke was surprisingly good and entertaining. Wasn't expecting Kirkland to have such a cool atmosphere.
34,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,This is a pretty good bar! I came with my boyfriend and was not disappointed. The bartenders are great and really have things under control. There were a few rowdy customers but the bartendars/waiters promptly handled it. The atmosphere is …
35,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,First time here but the band was fun! Totally diverse so it serves people who love different genres. The theme was 'may the 4th be with you' did not know but it was fun to see all the guys dressed in different star wars characters. Bars …
36,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The atmosphere was good, nice place to play pool and listen to a band. The only issue was seating. They really don't have enough. We arrived @8 an hour before the band started and there was no seats left. Otherwise, great place, ample parking, felt safe."

40,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,It was Beatles tribute night the night we went....really good band.  The food was not your average bar fare. We had several of the appetizers along with the fish n chips..all were fantastic. The wait staff was almost too attentive...and I …

45,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,11 months ago,"LET ME SHARE WHAT I TEXTED MY KARAOKE FRIENDS. **Just wanna say ""Hey"" and share my thoughts about the set up at The Lime.  That stage was pretty cool, eh?  Good lighting.  Could've used some kind of a back drop to fill space.   The KJ was …"
46,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place rocks.  The owners are both very present especially during peak event nights and staff is always attentive, professional and friendly . Live music on Saturdays is always a plus and they even host comedy nights once a month.  Food menu is worlds apart from other bars in the area and priced accordingly."
47,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food great company, Live music, awesome"
48,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Nice spot. Visited it when it was Balls n Whistles and it seems to have improved. The bartender Kira was awesome. She was good about getting more drinks for me and my friends when we made ourselves known that we wanted to get a new drink …

51,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food here is awesome. I had a chicken, bacon, avocado, cheese, and egg salad called the CBRG, and they even give you the option to turn your salads into wraps, which I did! Yum. They also feature live music, crowd involved games, dart, and pool. Friendly atmosphere, and a great vibe!"

54,Lime Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,I have come to this bar many times in the past and have had a good review. I feel obliged to change this review after the events thats happened tonight. This bar had the most unprofessional staff I have ever seen in my life. The bartenders …
55,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Not many places on the east side that still have a tavern feel. The food was great and prices were good. Clean.
56,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Loud, crowded, fun sports bar on the edge of Redmond and Kirkland that has live music on the weekends.  There are lots of TVs which have decent views from just about any seat.  The service was good, despite the crowd and the food was surprisingly good as well.  Had a great time here!"
57,Lime Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"They have NOTHING with limes on their menu, beware! As a lime-lover, I was actually hoping they'd have an infused burger or signature drink. So I ordered a lime drop (meh). Nice booth & always fun to listen to karaoke, though."
58,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a hard review to write. I really LOVE this place. The food is great! I LOVE the: hand cut french fries, the french dip and the turkey sandwich. The drinks here are also cheap and strong.  Further, this is a really hot bar for …"
59,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is good, we had fish and chips, portion size was good for the price. We were there on a Saturday 11 ish, they seemed short staffed, one bartender did everything there was a woman there that did not help much, not sure what that was about. Overall, a good place."
60,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere. Went to see some live music and an old friend, ended up staying for several hours, had appetizers, many drinks and a great time. The live band played music everyone seemed to enjoy, with dancing availabe. Came back a …"

64,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,LOVE this place! I go with my work group on Sundays a lot for half off your tab night! Bartenders are super nice and helpful and Tiger (the karaoke guy) is super kind and encouraging!
65,Lime Bar, 3 stars ,a year ago,You get packed in like sardines if you go on a Saturday night. It's a free for all on parking and chairs inside so make sure you are early. Drinks were okay but nothing special. Staff were friendly enough
66,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The portions here are very good on all the lunch specials that i've tried. The best value is the all you can fish and chips on Fridays. The fillets are more than just snacks, they are basically whole sides. Service has been great and food is relatively quick that I have time to finish my meal with time to spare during my lunch hour."
67,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great venue. Fun crowd
Fantastic band! Dr Funk!"
68,Lime Bar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Great place to party if your that type. The alcohol flows very freely and you may not remember what you did last night but isn't that half the fun of going out!  If your looking for just Good times with your friends and you don't want to vet picked up on all night there are other more appropriate venues available in Kirkland.
69,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good atmosphere for those 40+. That's not exactly my thing, but the food makes up for it. California Grinder is great, and Prime Rib on Wednesdays is usually awesome and priced low."
70,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Crab was amazing! And thanks to our server I found my new favorite cocktail!
71,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Went and saw some live music offered there the staff was very good in their service and very friendly. The crowd was definitely laid back and dinner offerings were very good. Featuring full bar service.
72,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It was chosen for retirement party. We work in Everett, so it was considered worth the drive. Drinks were ok. I asked for a velvet hammer or sex on the beach or Bellini didn't have a clue what I was talking about and didn't bother to look …"
73,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Some friends and I went to a trivia night here, which was very fun. The food was good and a great price. My french dip sandwich was good, though I would suggest getting a different side than fries."
74,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Surprisingly wonderful happy hour eats! I tried the pulled pork, and it was both cheaper *and* tastier *and* more complete than the same dish I tried at Trellis' happy hour later that week. Wait staff was quick and courteous."
75,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good service, great music and the food was pretty standard bar fare but the drinks were good. Definitely go when they are doing live music and do some dancing."
76,Lime Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We went there to watch an MMA match, one of only a few places in the area broadcasting it. I'm pretty sure they were over capacity by at least 50 people. Service was extremely slow as expected and we never had a place to sit or even put our drink for 2 hours."
77,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A phenomenal place to go for live music, darts, pull tabs, pool and great drinks.   The owners and staff are all amazing and make you feel like part of the family in no time"
78,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"WOW what a good dancing place. Even though it gets too pack in , you need to get there real early before 8 pm to get ant kind of seat! Good entertainment. People are pretty cool too."
79,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Kind of a dive bar but in a good kind of way!
80,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Rarely do I get five stars to anyone, but the owners deserve every single star! They listen to feedback, and mold to the needs of their popular evening venue. The music they bring to the stage, matches or tops any other venue on the east side."
81,Lime Bar, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Service here was extremely slow. The bartender seemed to help certain people and not the others. Maybe she was friends with them or they were locals? The prices also seemed high for the dive bar that it is. They have good live music on weekends.
82,Lime Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good spot to watch a game.  Lots of TVs, lots of seating options, convenient parking and a decent beer selection.  The main drawback is the mundane menu selection and mediocre food quality.  I'll be back for NFL Sunday Funday though!"
83,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic experience! Beer recommendations were solid, the nacho gator tots were perfect, and the monday karaoke was next level. Highly recommend if you are iin the area or looking to spice up Seattle living."
84,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This Club, which in a past life may have been a money laundering outfit for the Russian Mafia, is now apparently on the up and up. They must be doing something right as it appears always to be crowded. The service is decent. The sound and lighting are pro level. Did not try the food, not many vegan options it appears"
85,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Small but fun! Free and 1$ taco tuesday. The comedy was actually pretty on point! Ive paid more (like 25-30$) and saw far worse!! Really great comedy show!
86,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Sometimes love music all the time three pool tables and bar games including darts.  Happy hour is great with an all you can eat crab night on Thursdays. Karaoke, industry night and beer pong on the tab for some nights as well."
87,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fun and lively place.  Check the calendar on their web page - there is something different happening every night of the week.  Wide, eclectic range of customers. Friendly staff.  We really had a blast and will certainly return!"
88,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a really nice venue for when it comes to floor space. I got to see a really cool band play and watch the fight for free. Well I bought a beer of course. Bird friendly bartending staff and security
89,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Always great service, good food and fun environment! Loved their Friday and Saturday night bands  and dance floor Pre Covid!"
90,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"if you are in Kirkland and want to see live music on a Friday or Saturday night, this is the place to go. You can catch all kinds of bands like Hysteria Def Leppard tribute, Dr Crue - Motley Crue tribute and Hair Nation there. The bar food …"
91,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice beer selection. Food was good. Music was a little too loud for my taste but a younger patron probably won't mind.
92,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a very fun casual sports bar. Pool tables, darts, live music and lots of TV's to watch sports. There is also a large free parking lot with handicap parking. The bathrooms are large and the a handicap stall. This seems to be a over 21 bar, so not a place for kids."
93,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"New owners and new name, now called the Lime. Awesome staff and food, definitely a regulars bar,  but if you know how to treat people, you'll get great service here, like most bars.  Great place to watch sports events! Extra parking underneath, rubntug conviently located next door...jk!"
94,Lime Bar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"In my opinion, this place lacks character and friendly bartenders. I used to be regular when a husband and wife owned and worked the bar at this place and it was called Valhalla, it was a fun place to hang. It feels soulless now. 12 ppl at …"
95,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Fun band. Good drinks.
96,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Drinks were tasty! Good venue to see a band!
97,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good food! Lots of space and the door guys were attentive but not jerks! Good place to have a fun night out.
98,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The lime is a great causal bar. They do events like trivia and sports. The food selection is typically bar food. The variety is as large as some other bars, but the quality is good, and the drink prices are reasonable."
99,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"So much to do! they have pool, karaoke, beer pong, pull tabs, darts and an arcade! Curtis happened to be bartending when I was there and his service was swift and efficient, while also being kind and personable!"
100,Lime Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice beer selection. Food was good. Music was a little too loud for my taste but a younger patron probably won't mind.
101,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great cover bands for Styx and Boston. Plenty of room to dance, and even playing some pool. I would take half a star off for a pool cue with no tip though."
102,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food here is awesome. I had a chicken, bacon, avocado, cheese, and egg salad called the CBRG, and they even give you the option to turn your salads into wraps, which I did! Yum.

It's a great place. Nice atmosphere and great prices. Parking can be difficult sometimes."

124,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What a fun place. Very crowded but fun. Not sure if there's always a plethora of attractive middle-aged women, but if that's the case, I'll be back :)"
125,Lime Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,So I wasn’t allowed to buy drinks because “You need a WA state ID or from any other state.”... WHAT? It’s 2019 people and you guys don’t even know the laws here! I have a Puerto Rico issued Real ID! Go to WA Gov website and study the law …

137,Lime Bar, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"The atmostphere is a little dark, but it's great for watching games.  They have a weekly foosball tourney that is pretty cool, and they serve good food and Fireball!  What more could you want?"
138,Lime Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of those places you are happy to see succeed. The owner is a long time restaurant manager that finally got her own place. kudos!
139,Lime Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent venue, but effort needs to put into letting folks move around when at capacity (i.e., move some of the seating and tables)., the difficulty in getting around made me want to leave."
