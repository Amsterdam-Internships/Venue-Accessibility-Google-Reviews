0,Bunga Mawar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Small Indonesian joint run by a lovely old couple. Considering the location I found it surprisingly non-touristy yet welcoming. Sight of the old lady greeting locals coming in for a meal reminded me of a friendly aunt. I tried what I assume ‚Ä¶
1,Bunga Mawar, 4 stars ,a year ago,"This place is not too far from the Centraal station. Homey interiors and not too big.
The food tasted good but not great for my Indonesian tongue :p ‚Ä¶"
2,Bunga Mawar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This is now one of my favourite restaurants I've been to in the world! The food was SO DELICIOUS! I would definitely come back here if I'm ever in Amsterdam again. It's a must try!
3,Bunga Mawar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Sadly does not live up to the hype. Ice cold rice, cold vegetables. Asked for the rice to be heated and we were told they didn't have a microwave. No apology or explaination. Hideous service. Sorry but we didn't want to risk food poisoning.  Half the menu also unavailable. Incredibly disappointing."
4,Bunga Mawar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Small homely Indonesian restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the city. Came here with the family and we all enjoy the food very much.  Ordered the Nasi Rames which comes on different bowls and Ayam Pedas. Portions are ‚Ä¶

9,Bunga Mawar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A jewel tucked away among the narrow streets of Amsterdam. Small and quiet with a feel of visiting an close family member, waiting by the table and talking about old memories while they prepare a home cooked meal for you and your friends. ‚Ä¶"

We wanted to try Indonesian food and Bunga Mawar was nearby. Glad we went as ‚Ä¶"
11,Bunga Mawar, 1 star ,2 years ago,Too expensive and dishes are too simple. Also 3‚Ç¨ for rice??! It should be free
12,Bunga Mawar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Cold rice for ‚Ç¨3, half of my urapan was too cold to eat, staff wouldn't reheat food. Half the items on the menu weren't available. Cash only, so come prepared - or even better, don't risk food poisoning and go somewhere else."
13,Bunga Mawar, 1 star ,2 years ago,Unfortunately did not live up to all the glowing reviews. The service was poor. Many items on the menu were unavailable.
