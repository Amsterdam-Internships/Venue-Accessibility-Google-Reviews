0,Dam Good Coffee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,It really was damn good! The staff are lovely and the location is the perfect place to people-watch. Both the cake and coffee were impeccable so it totally lives up to its name!
1,Dam Good Coffee, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Dam Bad Coffee much? Coke was warm as hell, frappuchino had no taste at all. They have no right being this expensive."
2,Dam Good Coffee, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Quiet little joint to enjoy coffee. However, coffee not anything special and quite pricey."
3,Dam Good Coffee, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I thought something might be up when I saw the number of syrups on offer to go with the coffee - no, no, no!
The service was totally indifferent. However, by some miracle the flat white was ‚Ä¶"
4,Dam Good Coffee, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Ordered a cortado and it was so delicious that I returned the next day for another. The sweets looked yummy and there was plenty of seating outdoors. The location is great for people watching with views of dam square and stinky carriage horses.
5,Dam Good Coffee, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst coffee ever. Don't go there, rather walk couple minutes and have coffee somewhere else. Ordered a soy latte (that's the only vegan option) we had to leave it there. Couldn't finish it. They served it in a paper cup and it was ‚Ç¨6. They wouldn't even know if they had vegan selection. Big disappointment."
6,Dam Good Coffee, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Probably the most expensive coffee I've ever bought in my life, but this is Amsterdam. Besides the tourist-gouging prices, the service was average and uninterested, and the decor was average too."

8,Dam Good Coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place owns up to the name ""Dam good coffee."" As an American, I'd been searching for a place that served large portion sizes and this place does! My favorite place to get a to-go coffee while I shop."
9,Dam Good Coffee, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Damn bad coffee!! Bad service and low quality! We asked for 1 espresso and 1 cappuccino and without asking they charged the big cups. And the cakes were not fresh... therefore we ended up paying 17,50 for the worst coffee experience ever in amsterdam."
