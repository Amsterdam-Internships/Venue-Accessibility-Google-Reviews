1,Sushi House, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"I like those! I have never seen Japanese owned Japanese sushi restaurant. In my opinion, this restaurant‚Äôs sushi is more  Japanese style than normal Japanese restaurants‚Äô :)"
2,Sushi House, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The best sushi I have had in Amsterdam. Very fresh and tasty. Excellent delivery and customer service. We have been ordering there for over a year and we are (my kids too) always very satisfied.
3,Sushi House, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"One of my favorite places in Amsterdam. Incredibly friendly staff, great and well-balanced food, clean place, quick service, good pricing, and they‚Äôre always ready to think along. Their recommendations hit the spot as well."

it's GREATüòãüòã
really high recommendüëç"
5,Sushi House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very fresh ingredients and uses real wasabi. The ratio between fish and rice is just like how sushi should be, thick sliced fish covered the entire surface of rice. The quality of the fish is so much better than the other sushi places in this price range üëç"
6,Sushi House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"By far the best sushi I‚Äôve had in Amsterdam and potentially best overall. Could not recommend more! Quality and taste of everything we‚Äôve had has been incredible. On top of the sushi, the Gyoza are absolutely incredible. Have had the spring ‚Ä¶"
7,Sushi House, 5 stars ,a year ago,I have been a customer of Sushi House for some time now and I thought they deserve to have a good review. Indeed the wait time can be long during sunny days (Sushi rush !) but being aware of that we always place our order an hour in ‚Ä¶

9,Sushi House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wow. I'll have to give 5 stars, without a doubt. I'm from Asia, and was horrified by Dutch food in general. Albert Heijn sushi pack(9 euros) was the worst sushi I've ever tried in my life. Other sushi restaurants were disappointing too. And ‚Ä¶"
10,Sushi House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We really like Sushi House, because of a renovation we had no Kitchen for a few weeks (thank you Stox) and did go there a lot of times during that period. The Staff there was always very friendly and helpful. The Food was always great, good ‚Ä¶"
11,Sushi House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quite authentic Japanese cuisine. The way it is managed and kept gives a very satisfactory feeling of clean and hygienic restaurant. No place to eat there, just take away or deliveries. You'll enjoy for sure. for more experiences like this, follow @quiquinnv"
12,Sushi House, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Just good sushi for takeout compared to other takeouts. Price is fair since the quality is fine. Sometimes they have good offers wich is a little extra.
13,Sushi House, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Decent pick up sushi / a little on the pricy side because it‚Äôs only take away / basic dutch sushi menu / fresh fish and friendly service. Good for a mid week delivery
14,Sushi House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super nice and friendly crew, always with the smile :) very good sushis, super fresh! Made in direct üëå worth the price definitely"

28,Sushi House, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"(Translated by Google) 1 hour and 45 minutes to wait. called 3 times. Very good sushi, but the price is accordingly. Delivery time really needs to be better. In any case, inform your customer so that you know that it takes so long. ‚Ä¶"
29,Sushi House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Sushi House is definitely my favorite when it comes to sushi, I don't order anywhere else nowadays. Always good quality fresh fish, large pieces and the hot food is never cold. The price is certainly in proportion to ‚Ä¶"
30,Sushi House, 1 star ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Actually 1 star is still too much for the delivery. First estimate after the order was 50 min. Well, bang, but yes it was Saturday. After 1 hour and 15 min called, the warm snacks took a little longer. So we got a 15 ‚Ä¶"
31,Sushi House, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) The sushi is always good but the delivery times are really terrible. Then you get an indication of a time, it is delivered almost standard 40-60 minutes later. If you call you will hear 'sorry it is very busy'. ‚Ä¶"
32,Sushi House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Hands down for the best delivery & take away sushi restaurant in Amsterdam. Super tasty and deliciously fresh! Big rolls, so don't let the price put you off. (One small nag: replace the extractor hood in the kitchen ‚Ä¶"
33,Sushi House, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Delicious sushi that are large in size. If you order through their website they often have free sushi roll from 25 euros. The sushi is qualitatively better than Sushi point, Sumo and Sunny sushi. Not 5 stars because ‚Ä¶"
34,Sushi House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"(Translated by Google) The sushi is large, has a lot of rice and is therefore quite heavy, but despite that it remains one of the best sushi shops in Amsterdam. The fish is very fresh, clean and good. Not a pleasant thing, but it doesn't ‚Ä¶"
35,Sushi House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Super fresh home-made Sushi of good quality. Not cheap, but you also get something in return. The sushi is also larger than with others, especially the inside out rolls. I'll definitely return! ‚Ä¶"
36,Sushi House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"(Translated by Google) I normally never write reviews, but I just want to say that Sushi House is insane. You will be helped spontaneously and the quality of the food is top! If you are going to order or pick up sushi somewhere, this is the ‚Ä¶"
37,Sushi House, 5 stars ,10 months ago,(Translated by Google) Fresh sushi. For special occasions we get a sushi platter here. Nice big sushi. ‚Ä¶
38,Sushi House, 2 stars ,3 years ago,(Translated by Google) The pieces of sushi were too big; no more good food and not as it should be. Less rice would improve the taste of the tasty fish. There are better sushi places in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶
39,Sushi House, 1 star ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) These people let you wait almost 2 hours with the excuse that they have no delivery people. Then old, weak, dirty sushi is delivered. Never order here again !! Scandalous service and food quality. Never order here !! ‚Ä¶"

43,Sushi House, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Sushi is ok, but always deliver later than promised and even when it is taken, it always takes longer than they indicate in advance. Unfortunately. ‚Ä¶"
44,Sushi House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Here you are (rightly) pointed out that quality has its price. At the same time, the ""Patron"" proudly offers something beautiful from the range for its Toko. Deliciously fresh. A great asset to Amsterdam (Oud) -South. ‚Ä¶"
