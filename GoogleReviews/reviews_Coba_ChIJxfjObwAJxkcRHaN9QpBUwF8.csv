0,Coba, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Coba is life! Crazy tequila and mezcal menu! And the tacos are just amazing and made with fresh ingredients! I looove everything about that place!
1,Coba, 5 stars ,3 months ago,You can taste the attention and creativity in the sophisticated food and cocktails. Love that you can eat every dish with your hands. With the music and the style you feel like being in Mexico. Staff is very friendly.
2,Coba, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"love love love coba, definitely the best tacos in amsterdam üß° I especially love the beef & fish tacos, the dessert & the margaritas are üí£! thanks coba, will definitely come back many more times!!"

4,Coba, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Taste of individual dishes was awesome, staff friendly, forthcoming and knowledgeable. I have no complaints but then again we have plenty of money and generally don‚Äôt complain about every little thing in life (party of four)."
5,Coba, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"I really loved the place, amazing food and really delicious. I can say it is over priced‚Ä¶
But a place you can visit ones in a while. ‚Ä¶"
6,Coba, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I‚Äôm Mexican and I was In love with this restaurant. What a great concept. Mexican food mixed with a touch of Europe. Drinks are really nice and surprising. While I was eating my tacos I felt for one minute in Mexico. Definitely I highly recommend this restaurant. Great music as a plus
7,Coba, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want really, really, really good tacos - this is your place to go. We tried a lot tacos but this place makes you feel like you are in Mexico, also because of the delish Mescal drinks. ‚Ä¶"
8,Coba, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing service and the best tacos I have ever eaten (I did a Mexico trip for more than 1 month )! My favourite one is the taco with octopus and I can also highly recommend the ceviche & the fried fish one.
But be aware that the prices are quite high!"
9,Coba, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Hip Mexican street food restaurant in up an coming 'Noord'. Food was good, but somewhat overpriced for what you get. All the dishes are ‚Ç¨9.5 but seems a bit much (e.g. one of the dishes are just two small quesadillas) also the cocktails are ‚Ä¶"
10,Coba, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We ordered almost the whole menu. Everything was delicious. Variety of tastes. Spicy and sour cactus leaves with smoky flavour. I love it. Seabass was also great. The mocktails were nice as well. The survice was good too. We got good ‚Ä¶

14,Coba, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Love it!!!!
The food is amazing. The service is perfect. Overall, a great experience. One of my favorite restaurants in Ams."
15,Coba, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Might be the best Mexican I‚Äôve ever had and definitely my newest favourite spot in Amsterdam. Sooo good I don‚Äôt want more people to find out about it!
16,Coba, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Finding good Mexican food (real tacos, not wraps or burritos) so far away from home is extremely hard but extremely enjoyable as well, and even more if you have tortillas and salsas to take back home. ‚Ä¶"
17,Coba, 5 stars ,9 months ago,This is the place to be in AMS for a great experience and even better taco‚Äôs. Lovely staff and good vibes all around. Just low key enough for the relaxed atmosphere and entourage but expect high end cuisine mixed with Mexican street style food. Kudos! 5 stars!
18,Coba, 2 stars ,a year ago,"I was excited but I found it pretty deluding, and the gap between the expectations and reality is huge. Atmosphere is nice,  food quality is good, but portions are not even an appetizer with the price of a main course. You pay 12-13 euros ‚Ä¶"
19,Coba, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Noord gestoord! What a great addition to the upcoming Amsterdam Noord! Don‚Äôt expect churros, street corn or guac with chips. This is not your typical Mexican food joint. Cool and laidback vibe, helpful and friendly staff. The prices are a ‚Ä¶"

24,Coba, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place, sweet and helpful service and very tasty dishes... A real Mexican in the north side of Amsterdam.."
25,Coba, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Elaborate, creative and delicious tacos, they will cater for any dietary requirement. Good selection of cocktails and mezcales. Great atmosphere and service - make sure you book! ‚Ä¶"
26,Coba, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Some of the best tacos I ever had. Very authentic restaurant with a tequila and mezcal menu that does not disappoint.
27,Coba, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The food tasted good but it was quite expensive for very small portions, and it annoyed me that they pressure you to share but then don't optimize the food for sharing,  e.g. tacos came in 3s, they have no utensils to cut tostadas in half, ‚Ä¶"
28,Coba, 1 star ,10 months ago,Bought a ‚Äútostada de pulpo‚Äù take out box presuming it contains a complete meal - however several ingredients are missing. For ‚Ç¨28 euro per box I expected at least some pre-made tostada dough; OR that we were made aware that the tostada is not included during check out. Very disappointed and annoyed.
29,Coba, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty tacos, never been to Mexico but after last night I am looking forward to its street food! Small dishes so be prepared to order many. I think I had like 10 tacos at the end + 1 margarita = 53 euro ‚Ä¶"
30,Coba, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was really, really good. Best taco's/tostada's in Amsterdam and maybe Netherlands. ‚Ä¶"
31,Coba, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This place is overrated, food and drinks are very expensive with small portions and worse of all it doesn't taste like real Mexican, what a shame! Also first ""Mexican""restaurant with no Mexican beer, nothing at all. Staff has no idea about ‚Ä¶"
32,Coba, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Everything we ate was delicious, though as other reviewers suggest it wasn‚Äôt cheap! Our experience of the service was fine. Quite a small menu to choose from and some very quirky dishes (pig head taco? Calf tongue and marrow taco?) - if you or you dining companions aren‚Äôt adventurous eaters perhaps reconsider!"
33,Coba, 2 stars ,3 years ago,This is not a restaurant but a bar with a small menu. The dishes we choose tasted good but nothing reflecting the food I had during my stay with locals in Mexico City at all. Pricey and trying too hard to be authentic. Staff was friendly ‚Ä¶
34,Coba, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"If you've been to Mexico, you know it's almost impossible to get authentic Mexican food in Europe. This place comes pretty close. Bring your own spicy salsa and you'll be impressed with the menu."
35,Coba, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Small portions for a big price! The food is very tasty but doesn't justify the price by a long way.
They recommended that we shared portions amongst ourselves but no cutlery or ‚Ä¶"
36,Coba, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It has been quite a while that a restaurant does surprise us: Coba definitely is a cosy little gem in Amsterdam Noord worth a visit!
37,Coba, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food is fairly tasty but portions very small for the high price you pay!!!! However the presentation is good. They have no cutlery (they do have it in Mexico tho :D ) The staff is very friendly but they forgot to bring the last plate and ‚Ä¶

42,Coba, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice dishes to share, unexpected flavours. If you like smokey whiskey, please try the smoky mescal. Food is relatively ok priced, drinks are expensive. Friendly service and a very nice interior, as the Volkskrant (Dutch newspaper) called it, like you're on a Mexican Quentin Tarantino set."
43,Coba, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"What these people have done for the  Mexican kitchen goes beyond words. Everything i ate there was just amazing, even food i normally don't like. A bit of a hip happening spot but such good food!"
44,Coba, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Cool hotspot! The hipster place in the North of Amsterdam. This taqueria knows his stuff! Very good taco‚Äôs and tostadas. The only feedback would be that the host pushed every 10min to either order more food and to let us know that we had to close the tab because other people where waiting.
45,Coba, 1 star ,3 years ago,"What a terrible experience. No snacks. Their ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù orange wine was rank, and turned out to be rotten. No cutlery for some godforesaken. No mexican flavour. Sweetbread was fried to the point of being unrecognizable. Do not recommend, at all."
46,Coba, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Coba Taqueria is one of the hip new restaurants in North. The restaurant is how I imagine a cantina in Mexico. The staff is so friendly and the atmosphere is cosy. And then the food! The best Mexican food I've had so far in Amsterdam. Most ‚Ä¶
47,Coba, 1 star ,3 years ago,Prices of the food is way to high for the proportions you get. The taste is nice but it is too small to really enjoy it. No side dishes to choose and there is no cutlery. And the reservationsystem is too complicated and not social!
48,Coba, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good flavour but really small portions,  they don't have cutlery because apparently in Mexico you eat with your hands. ¬°No Mexican beers!"
49,Coba, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Come for the tacos, stay for the cocktails!"
50,Coba, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing tacos with really interesting ingredients! Interior is super cool old style Mexico and the service was excellent. Quite expensive but well worth it
51,Coba, 4 stars ,a year ago,Lovely restaurant that serves their tacos to-go during the pandemic. Great way to support them and still being able to eat their food üåÆ
52,Coba, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Recommended for anyone looking for great mexican food. Unusual dishes (like birria or lengua) that are hard to get away from home. I will definitely be back, specially because of their changing menu."

57,Coba, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"As a Mexican I can say it's not what you expect; this is not mexican street food to a 100%,  but it's a really nice interpretation from the chef that owns the place. Really good food and beautiful place!"
58,Coba, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is I've of a kind in Amsterdam. I absolutely loved their food. Reservations are required (a good while before your visit), but it's worth a wait"
