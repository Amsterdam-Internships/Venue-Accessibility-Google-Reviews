0,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great coffee place in city center of amsterdam. Reasonable prices and delicious coffee. Amazing selection of sweets, I loved red velvet cake. Try pear juice! So good üòä highly recommend! I love the interior too!"
1,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Really nice experience. The service is great and the cakes were good. Cosy mood, perfect to get warm again after a cold day in center Amsterdam."
2,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Was recommended to visit by a friend; the coffee is divine & the smashed avo on toast met all expectations for a quick brunch stop!
3,Koffiespot, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great little spot that makes good coffee. There are pastries and other things on offer that look great but I did not try any. Interior is lovely and chic and there is an nice outdoor area for people watching.
4,Koffiespot, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Fabulous coffee, but a 25 min wait for the waiter to bring banana bread and avocado toasties is ridiculous. It shouldn‚Äôt take so long. They kept on serving new customers ignoring our order until I had to remind them about us. They forgot about one item as well. The food was good though."
5,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A modern and cozy coffee shop on the Elandsgracht, this is one of my favourite spots. Staff is always super friendly even during the busiest times. Great coffee, desserts, and sandwiches. And if you're an early bird, the fresh baked croissants in the morning are absolutely delicious."
6,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Cozy, stylish place with great coffee and food."
7,Koffiespot, 3 stars ,a year ago,"It is such a stunning place, so much atmosphere in this lovely establishment. Nice staff as well. When it comes to espresso ... let's say the new way of espresso, way to acid for me, like the italian style. If you like the new style this is the place to go."
8,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The coffee is just amazing, really the best in Amsterdam. The vibe of the place is indescribable, you need to go and see it for yourself! People are so friendly and kind, really amazing. I had the beat avocado toast with the best flat white ‚Ä¶"
9,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Awesome ambient, very good music and delicious cake."
10,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best breakfast experience in Amsterdam so far. Nice range of breakfast with good coffee and friendly staff. A modern layout with an artistic twist.
11,Koffiespot, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice interior and okay coffee. But so overpriced! The title ‚Äòbreakfast to the max‚Äô is quite pretentious for only a croissant, a small cup of yoghurt and a very watery, tasteless pear juice. But it‚Äôs in a touristy neighbourhood, so they can probably just get away with it."
12,Koffiespot, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Really nice place and excellent coffee. Black people are also served here which is great.
13,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely spot, their capuccino is fabulous. I had the smashed avocado sandwich, it was delicious. Staff is really nice, I'll definitely come back!"
14,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Cool place with skilled staff. Excellent oatcookies. Pretty tiny (boxes with supplies on the ground were a bit messy), but very stylish ambiance. Would recommend. 10/10"

The staff was also especially friendly!"
18,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"best coffee in the town. baristas are professionals, prices are ok. might be improved ordering system because its a mess"
19,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cosy little spot on the busy Elansgracht. Nice coffee and a good selection of goodies to go with it. The vegan chocolate cake is a nice accompliment to the coffee. ‚Ä¶
20,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Perfect flat white.

23,Koffiespot, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good coffeebeans and nice flatwhite but brownie is too sweet! And attitude of staffs is not nice ....
24,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Unexpectedly good coffee so close to the city center, small cafe so sometimes you're lucky with a good spot or you need to wait for it, but worth it! ‚òïÔ∏è"

29,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing coffee shop in Amsterdam! Food was delicious, coffee and juices excelent! But the best part was the people who worked there, really welcoming and happy. Definitely a must go in Amsterdam üíòü§©"
30,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great coffee. Food offering, as with most of Amsterdam, can be hit and miss but the smashed avo was great. Would definitely visit again."
31,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent cafe with great drinks and treats at reasonable prices!
32,Koffiespot, 2 stars ,a year ago,"One of those Amsterdam places that skillfully blends not-bad-not-great coffee with the delicate art of incremental price gouging. ‚Ç¨15 for a black coffee, a chai thing and two pastries (‚Ç¨4 for a cinnamon roll!) is definitely in outrageous territory.  Hooray for hipster tax!"
33,Koffiespot, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Fantastic flat whites and nice limited sandwich and breakfast menu. Sometimes too busy for a seat but you'll always be made to feel welcome by the staff.

37,Koffiespot, 1 star ,a year ago,Coffees fine - apple juice is fine - service is quick but  outside seats taken by staff stitting on their laptop and phones...I was with my 2 girls cramming ourselves on to a small bench until some other seats became available.
38,Koffiespot, 1 star ,a year ago,"The coffee is good, but not worthy going there as the staff is unprofessional, arrogant, don‚Äôt respect the ‚Äúfirst in first out‚Äù and the prices are extremely high. Totally a no-go. There‚Äôs a lot more places in the neighborhood where the service is great, coffee is great and way cheaper."
39,Koffiespot, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good coffee, a real surprise to find a real coffee bar in Amsterdam, even the Espresso Macchiato, something you can hardly find outside Italy. Well done. Price aligned with the competition, maybe a little lower, but the service with the smile is really really appreciated!"
40,Koffiespot, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The croissant was delicious. The coffee was ok+ The Asian lady could be friendlier
