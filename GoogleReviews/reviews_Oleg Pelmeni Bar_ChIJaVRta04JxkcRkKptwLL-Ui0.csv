8,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Best meal of 2021. I'm grateful to the friend who recommended this restaurant serving ""modern russian cuisine"". I didn't quite know what to expect and went for the ""full taste experience"" from the menu. It turned out to be a real discovery ‚Ä¶"

13,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"No so many places where you can buy good and healthy food for your kid. But this one exactly what do you need. Beef pelmeni  exactly tasty and good like in Mother Russia)) Try specific Russian drinks - even better than I tried in Russia. Do not compare size of portions to prices, they are very reasonable as you will not be hungry after."
14,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"I have always heard about this place and never got a chance to go there until recently. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a disappointment - even though the food tasted okay, the prices and small portion sizes (regular pelmeni portion size ‚Ä¶"
15,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It was delicious, the food is great. 4 stars for that.

16,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really cozy place for the atmosphere and the food is good. As a Russian I find that the food tastes like home :) finally have a place to invite my non-Russian friends and introduce the cuisine to them.

19,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"we had lunch here and weren‚Äôt impressed. the portions way too small for the price, dishes look good but taste average. the staff didn‚Äôt know the menu, e.g. misinformed us about what sauce comes on top of the syrniki, and several items were missing."
20,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,This is the best place in the city to drink raf coffee! Syrniki and pelmeni meals definitely blowed my mind. Nice atmosphere and great people working here. Thank you!
21,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place with very decent but not cheap food. Staff is also friendly. And they make Raf coffee- something I could not find in Amsterdam after living many years in Moscow. Definitely check this place!
22,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"There is a nice kvas, but pelmeni is really overpriced (10 euro per 4 pieces...) and tastes like a very regular dish."
23,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really great food and experience! You would definitely want to try oluvie, beef or chicken pelmeni!"
24,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Gourmet Eastern European food. Mind blowing taste! Looooovie it
25,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We enjoyed the atmosphere and the design of the place. However, the food is hard to rate, except Olivier and Borsch. These two were great, while pelmeni and dessert did not worth their price. Also, apparently, we did paid for one extra ‚Ä¶"
26,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Pelmeni were good, as well as smetana, kvas and zapekanka. I also liked the vibe and service. What I didn't like was the amount of food and the price. I expected to get at least 20 Pelmenis for a big portion instead of 10 - come on, they're ‚Ä¶"

As a plus, Georgian wine and friendly atmosphere.

28,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious pelmeni that taste just like in Russia. Very juicy, especially good in combination with the home made kvass."
29,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Modern Russian food - refreshing, interesting, lovely! This is the first European location of a St. Petersburg-based bar.

33,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Disclaimer: I worked at Oleg's Pelmeni Bar for about six months. Take this into account when reading this review. That being said, nobody asked me to write it and I'm being as honest as I can. ‚Ä¶"

36,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A very nice surprise. We had a lovely dinner with, of course, salad olivier, great dumplings and a nice desert. Small dishes and terrific quality. Definitely worth another visit"
37,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Tasty food but small portions. Terrace is open but sitting inside is also convenient. You can pay by card.
38,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really delicious Russian food with great owner who really cares about your well-being and enjoying the food. Sometimes can even do special Russian dishes. Has really great Georgian wines as well. I'm so happy they opened
39,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had dinner here two weeks ago and was positively surprised. I did not know what to expect, but it was really a nice experience. The Pelmeni are all made in house we were told and are really nice with good sour creme and fresh topppings. The ‚Ä¶"

41,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We were really happy to come across Oleg pelmeni bar. Inexplicably nice mix of the traditional Russian cuisine and trendy pure interior. Great coffee and fermented beverages. I wish the portions had been bigger, that I get used to.‚Äã"

45,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is fresh and tastes good. The size of dishes is more like tapas, you cannot be full with any of the portions on its own, however the price is like full main dish. Any person who eats pelmeni can confirm that we cook at least 15 ‚Ä¶"
46,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Cool concept and fantastic service
47,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Not tasty food at all. It‚Äôs the only one ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù restaurant in Amsterdam by now, and they change traditional Russian dishes to something ‚Äúmodern‚Äù and not really tasty. Therefore, Oleg Pelmeni Bar gives a wrong perception of Russian ‚Ä¶"
48,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I tried Oleg Pelmeni for the first time yesterday with my friend from Russia. I asked him for advice, and he stated that a lot of the dishes were not correct. ‚Ä¶"
49,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 3 stars ,a year ago,The Pelmeni definitely matches russian standards. The prices are a bit steep but the employees and location are excellent. ‚Ä¶
50,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful modern decor and amazing place. It‚Äôs a great place for a long conversation over a light lunch and a nice drink. Food-wise I found the portions rather small (and hence on the expensive side), beef pelmeni I had seemed rather salty (for my taste). I‚Äôd probably come back, but for the ambiance, not necessarily the food."
51,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great fusion of traditional Russian food with contemporary fashion. My top 3 dishes: chicken dumplings, Olivier salad, syrniki. And don‚Äôt forget to order home grown kambucha"
52,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 3 stars ,a year ago,"I've only tried barszcz soup - but it weirdly tasted more like mushroom soup than beetroot.. nothow i know it from back home, and portion could be larger. Ok in general."
53,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Nettle pelmeni is an unforgettable taste experience! The combination of thin dough and nettle filling is surprising and delicious! The chef picks nettle in the forest himself!
54,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"New place in town! Super tasty handmade pelmeni‚Äôs, fantastic Russian culinary experience. Nice selection of natural wines and perfect coffees. Go go go to check it out!"
55,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Pelemeni are delicious but pricey for the size of the portion. Maybe throwing in a few more will do the trick :) I loved the Georgian wines they have!
56,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,As a Russian living abroad for more than 20 years I love to see a place like this open in my favourite city. I found everything tasting authentic yet with a modern european twist. ‚Ä¶
57,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"oh, finally great souls food in Amsterdam! you are amazing ü§ç"
58,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"To be honest was one of my worst experiences. Ordered pelmeni, which were first too salty and cold, from the second attempt came with undercooked meat and the final third attempt was fine, but indeed such a small portion... I was so hungry ‚Ä¶"
59,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The portions are a bit too small for what you pay. Haven‚Äôt try everything but pelmeni do not  taste the same as home made Russian ones. Zapekanka was good, improved the experience."
60,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Atmospheric location, an excellent combination of a modern look at classic Russian cuisine. Georgian wines were very pleased!"
61,Oleg Pelmeni Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place with simple and tasty Russian cuisine (finally in the Netherlands!). P.s. Olivier and beef pelmeni are the safest variant for your not-so-much-impressed-about-russian-food Dutch friends :)
