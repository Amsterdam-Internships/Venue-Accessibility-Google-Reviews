25,Nur Kabab, 2 stars ,a year ago,Portion sizes of HSP is pathetic and the taste isn't any better then other local shops. The kebabs are fine but the sizes for the HSP have halved since I last had one a couple months back.
26,Nur Kabab, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best HSP in the area - always busy with a constant stream of customers regardless of the hour. Also a good spot to people watch the interesting people who wash their car after midnight - free entertainment!

36,Nur Kabab, 1 star ,a year ago,"Don’t mind the food it’s a bit over priced honestly but had a very bad experience with a young girl that works there. She was extremely rude and honestly was lucky I didn’t have a go at her, how on earth someone is working there serving people the way she did is beyond me."

Good portion sizes.
Ordered a HSP, was filling, but not over the top. …"
38,Nur Kabab, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The kebabs are near quality. Two time in a row I've had barely any sauce on my kebab. I will go back but they need to get the sauce ratio right to have an excellent rating.
39,Nur Kabab, 5 stars ,8 months ago,The owners are great and their food is delicious. I definitely recommend going there
40,Nur Kabab, 1 star ,2 years ago,The Man Behind the Counter is Rude and Arrogant.He charge me $1 Extra for the $10 Chicken Biryani as a Service Fee  and  after 5 Min I went to Grab a water bottle he told me I have to pay $1 Extra again as a Service fee on a $2.5 water bottle. Be Aware they are Just ripping you off in the Name of the Service Fees
41,Nur Kabab, 1 star ,9 months ago,Just ordered meal of this place took my money and never delivered it when enquired about got told it's not their problem flipping thieves never gonna go near these crooks again
42,Nur Kabab, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great for meat eaters, especially if U want a late night feed. The falafels are a bit dry/bland and I think the only other choices for vegetarians are chips and biryani. The falafel kebab was pretty skimpy on the lettuce and tomato. If I get again, I'll be adding jalapenos to try and liven it up. Haven't tried the biryani yet."
43,Nur Kabab, 1 star ,3 years ago,Always has chips of Bone in the Kababs. New Owner yelled at me while confused because her Staff mucked up the order and I was waiting while she had passed my order to someone else.  I can live without this unhealthy place anyway.

56,Nur Kabab, 1 star ,5 months ago,Food was very bad no test..
57,Nur Kabab, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I felt bullied and treated rudely by a women staff member in an attempt to intimidate me. Will not be going back. (Like I said i won't be going back, me asking you not to be rude to me, returning your product and acting responsibly is a far cry from your story. that's funny. Horrible shop.)"
58,Nur Kabab, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Got a HSP on 1st of December. 3 people ate it and were all throwing up later on. (1 person was violently ill and was still sick Sunday afternoon)

61,Nur Kabab, 3 stars ,2 years ago,We ordered kebabs for takeaway from uber eats. wraps were not that fresh and food was really dry with really less sauces.
62,Nur Kabab, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Not bad for a late night HSP. Good to see they don't charge extra for cheese as well. Staff are friendly as well. It's a bit pricey though at $15 for a small HSP and a can, which isnt helped by the fact that there are no eftpos facilities onsite. I'd give it a 4.5 but Google doesn't do half stars."

66,Nur Kabab, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Had a regular hsp (lamb), the meat was absolutley rotten, the chips were boiled in water.Wasted my money. Vomitted the whole thing shortly after. Feeling sick.
Dont waste your money!"
67,Nur Kabab, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty hit and miss food wise, can range from from undercooked and half frozen chips to sometimes being pretty good,  service is always pretty average and they have zero remorse when  they mess up your order."
68,Nur Kabab, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst biryani ever eat in my life.
Chicken is same as kebab chicken on rice.
Go and learn how to make good biryani. even on youtube you can find how to."

74,Nur Kabab, 5 stars ,a year ago,Highly recommended fantastic food always fresh always very very tasty best kebabs in frankston.
75,Nur Kabab, 1 star ,4 years ago,Absolutely appalling. They are really slow in making them and if you don't hear them calling out your number they sit in the packet and sweat and go soggy. Their attitude is atrocious and I would not go here if it was the last place to go for food.
76,Nur Kabab, 1 star ,2 years ago,I ordered an expensive kebab with tabouli and got a soggy roll with a bit of greasy meat  and a TINY bit of parsley. If you want good food go elsewhere
