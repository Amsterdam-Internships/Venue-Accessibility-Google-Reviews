3,Het Monumentje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amsterdam cafe at its finest. A true gem, if you are a tourist visiting  have a peek and a beer and be on your way, keep your footprint to a minimum. Respect the local folklore, its inhabitants and the liberal tolerant atmosphere here... love to all!"
4,Het Monumentje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great little bar serving well into the night. Local craft beer, selection of Belgian beers and Paulaner on tap. No music requests but hey playlist was great. Highly recommend for catching up with mates."

6,Het Monumentje, 1 star ,4 years ago,"My friends and I are expats living in amsterdam and we were treated so badly when we arrived. Such rude service and not the usual friendly environment one would expect from a brown cafe in Amsterdam. Not worth the visit, go across the street instead to De Blaffende Vis for an excellent experience!"
7,Het Monumentje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The original Amsterdam caf√©. Do not miss, treat with respect and love!  Monumentje is the most special place in Amsterdam. The crowds, the ambient, the no-phone rule, the backgammon culture...just let go and enjoy"
