0,Teds place, 5 stars ,a month ago,The chicken katsu sandwich was the bomb. The Oreo pancakes were the bomb too. I recommend this for brunch. Coffee was not good so go for the cocktails ü•≥
1,Teds place, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Food was really good. Coffee also. You should make a reservation as it‚Äôs pretty booked. Prices are better than most breakfast places
2,Teds place, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"It was ok although the service a bit slow (and we asked for tap water which came 15min later, when food was served..). Overall tasty food but not my favorite. Cappuccino was without a tick foam."
3,Teds place, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best breaky in town - if you‚Äôre into brunch you‚Äôre so going to love this place. Everything is so yummy. Make sure to book your table in advance.
4,Teds place, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"We loved our Teds brunch and highly recommend them.  I made an easy breezy on-line reservation several days in advance. We arrived, checked in and were immediately seated. The menu is on a convenient QR code and we were set. ‚Ä¶"

Incredible brunch spot. We had the Norwegian Eggs and Philly Sandwich (subbed the steak for mushrooms), with waffle fries üíõ
Awesome service, friendly waitrons and just a cool spot üòç"
6,Teds place, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great place to eat at, the waitresses were genuinly kind and welcoming, the food was great and their menu is on point. It's an all around great address to eat at in Amsterdam and we'll definitly come back! ‚Ä¶"
7,Teds place, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice, cozy and cute little breakfast / brunch spot. Prices are a little high for what you get portion wise but the food is good."
8,Teds place, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Really nice French toast. Relaxed atmosphere and had a mix of shared tables and individual tables
9,Teds place, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"I came in with 2 friends and we got a dirty table for two and we were 3 people. Cool, we thought whatever if we can sit it‚Äôs fine. It took them 10/15 minutes to clean our table and another 10 to give as u menu.. ONE menu for three people. ‚Ä¶"
10,Teds place, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"It was really good food, excellent amount and taste for the price! It was quite chaotic on the day we were there I assume that was a fluke. But still our food was really on time and great!"

12,Teds place, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"A great location, good simple food- with outdoor and indoor dining option. If you stick with ordering the coffee and basics, it‚Äôs good. ‚Ä¶"
13,Teds place, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Friendly service, good food (vegetarian and glutenfree bread options) average city prices. If you have chocolate cravings,  the 'Bueno French Toast' is amazing."
14,Teds place, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"This was such a lovely place for Brunch. I had the poached eggs and smokes salmon on a croissant and oh my god, it was so good! My partner had a Chicken avocado sandwich which he thought was delicious. Really good coffee and very clean and cosy inside, staff were all great too."
15,Teds place, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Beautiful cafe!! I was totally in love with the light atmosphere, delicious brunch and the beautiful design ü§ç Ted original French Toast was buttery and so yummy üòã The great combination if you waver between salty and sweet food. The purple ‚Ä¶"
16,Teds place, 4 stars ,a week ago,"Cosy place. Fast service.
Had the philly steak sandwich with a fried egg.. was very good..
Had to take out 1 star because they only had 1 baby chair.
Apart from that everything was perfect."
17,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,TEDS is a delightful breakfast/brunch spot a little bit outside of the heart of Amsterdam but it is way worth the quality of food and service. It was quite busy on a Sunday morning but with there being only two of us it was only a 10 min ‚Ä¶
18,Teds place, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very chilled brunch place, I recommend their eggs in purgatory, their cheesy bread is delicious! Their indoor space has some nice sofa area for talking, and a huge communal table for those want to work on their lap top. Their outdoor seating is limited though, so might need to book in advance for big groups or busy time."
19,Teds place, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"The food was good.
A bit odd that they were out of pancakes around 11:30."
20,Teds place, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Good place with really nice service, it was really tasty !! Just the brownie was not that good"
21,Teds place, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Fabulous breakfast in a really buzzy cafe. You're quite packed in as it's small and you should definitely book. Great service too so would highly recommend. Oh, and the bacon is really crispy!"
22,Teds place, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Had a fantastic breakfast burrito (they switched the bacon with mushroom no problem) and generally loved it!
23,Teds place, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Good atmosphere and the seats outside are a plus.
The service is slow, 20 minutes seated and still have to order.
The digital order system doesn't let cancel an item once selected. ‚Ä¶"
24,Teds place, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"It's a nice place to eat. The food is good, just a bit overpriced though. A simple sandwhich is ca. ‚Ç¨12. The service was alright, except that they took away my plate before I was finished. It was crowded, no seats left, but still felt rushed to check out."
25,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Ted's was such an experience! Amazing staff, delicious food, and the ambience was clean, fun, and modern. Ted's was my first introduction to Amsterdam cafes, and I would definitely go again."
26,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice interior, very friendly staff and good food (lovely vegan options!)"
27,Teds place, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The location is really beautiful, but the food was not that great. The pancakes were a bit cold and they didn't seemed to be fresh. The sandwiches have a lot of souses and I didn't like that."
28,Teds place, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Go here if you are really craving American brunch, otherwise you can do much better in Amsterdam. The dishes are decent but not amazing, service is lackluster, and the place can be too crowded to be comfortable. Overall it's a very mixed experience."
29,Teds place, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Nice experience and understand why Amsterdam would love this feminine chic little spot
30,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I will die happy now...

Mimosas were awesome! It was only lunch time! Coffee is fab too! ‚Ä¶"

32,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place! Very friendly staff, we only had to wait around 5 minutes at peak brunch time on a Sunday. Delicious food, nice interior, we will be back!"
33,Teds place, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,The waitresses seem unfocused. It took ages to order and then she forgot half the order. In the end it took 30 minutes to get a croissant which didn‚Äôt resemble a croissant. Not very high standard unfortunately.
34,Teds place, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"On our birthday we made reservations for breakfast at Ted's place Amsterdam. On arrival we were led to a table on the road.
The bench we were sitting on was right up against the bumper of a parked car. ‚Ä¶"
35,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 months ago,One of the best brunch caf√©s in Amsterdam!
36,Teds place, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was good but unfortunately their Eggs Benedict is lacking. The poached eggs for both my dish and my friend‚Äôs were overdone. In my case, my dish didn‚Äôt have a sauce so without the runny egg it was really dry. The bread tasted nice I guess..."
37,Teds place, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice staff, mostly English so good for tourists and expats. Local area vibe so doesn‚Äôt feel like a tourist trap. The service is very very good and on time. ‚Ä¶"
38,Teds place, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Food was ok, service a bit disappointing. On a Sunday at 11am they were already out of smoothies and pancakes. Slow service. What comes to the table is not what you see on Instagram (dish presentation). Doesn‚Äôt match expectations."
39,Teds place, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Classic hipster/tourist spot in Amsterdam. You're eating eggs Benedict on a croissant. creative i don't know but not expensive compared to bakers or little collins. the wait is long and you might be seated on the sofa if you're not patient. coffee: great. eggs: really good. the oj: fresh. service: ok
40,Teds place, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The whole experience felt a bit cheap, cheap bread croque madam, burn French toast which just tasted like toasted bread
Tea was ok ‚Ä¶"
41,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favourite brunch place in the city. The atmosphere and decor is really cool, in the front they have a huge poster of Van Gogh‚Äôs Almond Blossoms. The food is delicious and service is quick. I recommend the poached eggs on/in croissant with bacon or salmon and the french toast and the lavender lemonade."
42,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best Breakfast in Amsterdam, cosy place friendly staff and tasty food, loved the Egg Benedict with Smoked Salmon and the french toast was yummy but the beef steak was outstanding"
43,Teds place, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Solid all day breakfast place. They have gluten free options and the staff is very friendly. Seems to be popular with locals and many we're ordering brunch cocktails.
44,Teds place, 5 stars ,a year ago,Philly Steak is my favorite brunch choice from the menu! Also during the summer we order jar of Pims which accompanies beautifully our savory choices
45,Teds place, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Thanks for cancelling my food delivery at the time I was supposed to be delivered, now I'm going back to work without eating and this is the third time it's happened! Super reliable! ‚Ä¶"
46,Teds place, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We came when they were first opening, but the service was good and quick. I got the hot chocolate which was good, nothing spectacular but definitely delicious. I got the eggs Benedict which was ok, but when I got it the food was cold and ‚Ä¶"
47,Teds place, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service takes ages and the food is not very imaginative. A flat white is like a bowl of soup, please go take barista lessons from the people at Scandinavian Embassy they know what a fkat white looks like and tastes like. And next time dear ‚Ä¶"
48,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Our experience was simply AAAAAMAZING! Both the pancakes and the french toast were extremely delicious!
It took them some time to get us the order, just cause it‚Äôs the weekend, other than that we enjoyed the food and the place so much! ü§©"

51,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was our favourite breakfast place during our trip! Cool decor and amazing food, especially the Monster Croque!!!"
52,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A comfy place in Amsterdam with delicious food. The only downside is that it is too crowded (which just shows that people want to come here due to the good service) so you might be waiting some times to get a table.
53,Teds place, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was good, just cold by the time we got it. Coffee was great. Friendly staff, just slow kitchen during peak time on a Saturday. They offered a drink on the house to compensate, we declined as a lot of time was already wasted inbetween ‚Ä¶"

I ordered the French Toast with a side of bacon, extra dry/crispy. The french toast was nothing special, it was drenched in maple syrup. 30% of the bacon was ‚Ä¶"
55,Teds place, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Terrible service great food, I guess. This place could have been fantastic. The food was great but they rushed us out and wouldn‚Äôt make us any drinks past 1630 because they close at 1700. They made us feel super rushed and unwelcome. We will never return."
56,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is the second time I visit the restaurant/cafe. It is very nice, friendly and feels like local vibes. The food taste very good and I really enjoyed the experience. It deserve more reviews to strengthen its popularity."
57,Teds place, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I love going for brunch to Teds - the staff is very friendly and always helpful and smiling. The cocktails are super delicious and the food has the right sizes, but also the taste is green"
58,Teds place, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Such a lovely cafe with a special atmosphere, cosy sofas and a very friendly waitress. Food was original and varied"
59,Teds place, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"I went there with colleagues, we arrived on time and ordered foods and drinks. However it took quite long, even they didn't bring the drinks first (so we can have drinks while waiting for the food) and we had to asked to the bar. When the ‚Ä¶"
60,Teds place, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Discovered this brunch place today. The whole menu looked so yummy it aas hard to chose  the eggs were perfectly cooked.

Staff was nice and food was awesome.
I recommend Egg Norwegian. It‚Äôs simple but tasty af!
I‚Äôll come back there for sure."
63,Teds place, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing brunch, the food is delicious and friendly staff. They don't take reservations and it can get busy here, so try to get earlier or you'll have to wait. But the food is worth the wait! Try to seat outside during summer, the neighborhood is super charming."
64,Teds place, 1 star ,5 months ago,Reserved a table but had to wait outside for too long (30mins) so we left to another place. Shame they don‚Äôt organise their reservations and manage their capacities.
65,Teds place, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Cozy place that gets quite busy. Very good brunch options.
66,Teds place, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Friendly staff, great food and quick service! I wanted to try the whole menu but the eggs Benedict, Monster Crisco were great"

69,Teds place, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Great personel. Always friendly. The Philly Cheese steak sandwich is amazing

Edit: had to take away two stars. I‚Äôve eaten about a 100 cheesesteaks over the last 2 years. Quality differs every time, in staff and in the food"
70,Teds place, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great breakfast spot. Food was good and service friendly.  I would go again with no hesitation
71,Teds place, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place, selection of brunch meals and cocktails, clean bathroom. Little kitchen so expect long waiting time if it‚Äôs busy."
72,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for breakfast, delicious food and friendly staff. Highly recommended"
73,Teds place, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Try the Bec Bagel if you are hungry, if your tired or if you like tasty food, but try it! Coffee was good too."
74,Teds place, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place! The service was good, the coffee was great. We liked the food. My one comment/suggestion is that the food would go from good to amazing if the bread was upgraded. Brioche French toast was excellent but the basic white bread on ‚Ä¶"

81,Teds place, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, however service might be improved. Food ok. Sweet seats outside."

83,Teds place, 2 stars ,7 months ago,We didn‚Äôt get our drinks for the first 20 mins and we had to wait one hour for the food. Staff was inexperienced and unprofessional. Food was good.

85,Teds place, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is probably a must try for breakefast in Amsterdam! The food is really good! If you stay in Amsterdam, you have to try this restaurant for breakfast!"

87,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really cute place and a great tasting brunch
88,Teds place, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good food and lovely ambiance. Enough choice on the menu but it's not cheap. Meal sizes are not big.

90,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Buzzing brunch spot in a quiet side street! Eggs poached and cooked to perfection!
91,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great breakfast spot. Friendly staff and decent price. Amazing eggsbenidict!
92,Teds place, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing food and service! I live locally and every time I have tried to go to Ted‚Äôs in the last five years there is a queue. Now I understand why! Attention Aussie expats-all day brunch :) The people who work here are so fun and engaging and happy to help with anything. I have been twice in the last week it is so good!
93,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food and drinks are good, and the staff is amazing - very friendly and very helpful. The place has a young and cozy vibe, with contemporary music in the background. There are also power outlets spread across the place. Lastly, the place ‚Ä¶"

95,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really good food. Crowded place during weekends but worth the wait.
96,Teds place, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Comfiest Comfort Food. It never lets you down. A must for brunches and hangover food. Try the fries. Wow
97,Teds place, 1 star ,10 months ago,"We made a booking in advance. Our table wasn't covered at all in the rain, no other table was directly in the rain like ours was and the waitress told us we couldn't move our table into shelter due to social distancing. We eventually moved ‚Ä¶"
98,Teds place, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Service a bit slow, food ok, coffee not so great. But a nice vibe."
99,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came here for brunch on a Tuesday and were not disappointed. This is a really cozy place and the staff are friendly. I had the avocado and goats cheese on sourdough and the portion was much bigger then I expected it to be. I regret not ‚Ä¶

101,Teds place, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Cute cafe, with average food ... The waiter however was sick and kept sniffling and coughing into our drinks and food as he brought it :( also a little odd that it's a sit down/full service restaurant but they don't bring you water (that part is self serve)"
102,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great breakfast place, logging on to the WiFi is a bit arduous though"
103,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The service was exceptional. The woman who was in charge of our table today was extremely professional, helpful, smiling, nice, understanding. And we were not quite easy customers as we found the aubergine not cooked enough. She took care of the situation with a remarkable calm. We had the best time thanks to her."
104,Teds place, 1 star ,2 years ago,The waiters were incredible rude there and were so unfriendly. They shouted at us for moving tables together outside and said we would have to pay the fine and then just walked away. After that we decided to leave and found a much nicer ‚Ä¶
105,Teds place, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great prices and food. Perfect for brunch.
106,Teds place, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Locaties is nice, but food service very poor. Some dishes seem instagrammably pleasing, but with that all is said. The food simply wasn‚Äôt good. Bread not toasted enough, avocado toast with barely avocado. French toast that tastes dull and dry. Drinks not hot and lack in taste."
107,Teds place, 3 stars ,10 months ago,Lovely atmosphere and good selection of brunch items. My chicken avo sandwich was ok but too much bread relative to filling.
108,Teds place, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Good coffee but their poached eggs were too well done. Toast was dry.
109,Teds place, 2 stars ,2 years ago,My friend and I tried to come here for Brunch on a Saturday and it was very busy! We waited at the bar for a bit (not sure why they don't serve people food here) and the bartender didn't offer us anything and didn't have a great attitude. ‚Ä¶
110,Teds place, 2 stars ,2 years ago,I suppose the food wasn‚Äôt awful but the service definitely was. I was completely done with my incorrect breakfast before my coffee on a dirty saucer  ever showed up. I‚Äôve worked in a lot of restaurants so I try not to be too critical for a ‚Ä¶

112,Teds place, 1 star ,a year ago,"We saw the sandwich of  the neighbor (goat cheese and avocado), seems great so we took the same. Well we did not get the same, super small slices, almost NO avocado.... you should be more consistent between the clients, for 11.5Euros its not acceptable, we live next door but will not come back !"
113,Teds place, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Food is great but service needs to be improved, our orders were only taken 20 mins later we were seated and we had to ask for some things twice."
114,Teds place, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ok nice atmosphere for sure and the staff is very friendly and nice too. I would go back for a coffee or coktail to experience the environment for sure. However the food wsnt that great. ‚Ä¶

We spent 3 mornings in a raw there, each day trying a different dish and they were all great! ‚Ä¶"

117,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Me, my fianc√© and our two friends spotted this place while looking for a place to eat breakfast. The staff was very sweet and the place is very cozy with a cheeky sense of humor. I had the best banana pancakes I've ever eaten and the rest ‚Ä¶"
118,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I won't write a long review for this place because it's unnecessary - it's simply excellent! From the bright, modern interior, to the friendly staff, to the delicious and fresh food and drinks, TED knocked it out of the park on every level. Highly recommend if you're in Amsterdam looking for somewhere to brunch."
119,Teds place, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good solid breakfast with mostly good service.
120,Teds place, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Long wait for average food, under-staffed, table not cleaned properly between customers. I was really hoping for more as it seems like a great concept, across 3 cities, but they are doing fine on the tourist route and don't need to provide ‚Ä¶"
121,Teds place, 1 star ,2 years ago,The food was not special and the service didn‚Äôt mind us at all. I only remember those five thin pieces of banana on top of my French toast and dry bacon for 11 EUR. Maybe they used very special expensive eggs to to make this toast to justify the price?
122,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Received our food surprisingly quick given the high quality. Ordered the Chicken Avocado and it was delicious!
123,Teds place, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ted's is quite small; as many tables as possible are squeezed in to the narrow room. Waiting staff is not unfriendly but not very service minded either. They were very busy chatting while the place was packed and my coffee was forgotten. ‚Ä¶

126,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Yummy food in an adorable cafe. Very trendy
127,Teds place, 1 star ,a year ago,Very disappointed seeing as we had only heard good things about TEDS in Utrecht. We went to amsterdam for our anniversary last week and decided to go for brunch. As we walked in the staff was not very welcoming and we werent even greeted ‚Ä¶
128,Teds place, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The place itself and staff are great. We all tried different dishes. The menu, finishing and presentation of the dishes left me utterly disappointed. UTTERLY....there are plenty of simple 'bruin cafes' and other brunch spots in Amsterdam ‚Ä¶"
129,Teds place, 1 star ,5 years ago,"This place is really overrated. It is trendy but they can't seem to cope with the hipness. Had to wait for over an hour for our food. After half an hour it turned out the poached eggs we ordered weren't possible today, so had to wait ‚Ä¶"
130,Teds place, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"This place has a great selection of brunch dishes, and they all sound really yummy. We had a great Eggs Benedict, Croque Monsieur, and yoghurt with fresh fruit - the fruit was nice and ripe! My only complaint would be that the food took a long to time arrive, otherwise the service was good and it was reasonably priced."
131,Teds place, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Place that definitely tried to be 'trendy'. On a Wednesday morning there was enough space for us (2 ppl), but I really disliked the noise inside. This is because there is an open kitchen, and there was constant noise of tableware. The music ‚Ä¶"
132,Teds place, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I love to come to this place for a weekend brunch though it is super crowded at brunch times. End up having a coffee and Eggs Napolean for brunch. On a weekend either come early or go for a late lunch (breakfast all day!!). Have not yet ‚Ä¶
133,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious breakfast! We had the breakfast burrito, French toast, and the Parmesan fries with truffle mayo. Everything was great! The service was friendly and they have free WiFi. Definitely recommend :)"
134,Teds place, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The poached eggs with croissant is an excelent idea and taste wonderful!!! The service is good in general though the lady that works there is a bit rude. The yogurt with granola and fruit is very good and the whole place is nice.
135,Teds place, 1 star ,3 years ago,Pretty restaurant but PISS POOR SERVICE! I watched the waiters serve every other guest with a smile except for my table. My food took forever to come out and all I ordered was a croissant. The waitress also served other tables water but ‚Ä¶
136,Teds place, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Worst and most rude service I have had in the Netherlands. Twenty minutes before someone asked our order, waitress forgot to put our order in the system and it was almost an hour before we even got drinks.  Food (eggs benedict) was okay, ‚Ä¶"
137,Teds place, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really liked this place, walked in to see the place full of couples lol but after tasting the avocado toast and breakfast burrito it‚Äôs clear that this place isn‚Äôt JUST Instagram friendly. Very reasonably priced with a chill, hip atmosphere ‚Ä¶"
138,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We really enjoyed our brunch here! The staff was really nice and the food was awesome! Cool spot to hang out and grab a coffee or a drink too
139,Teds place, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Very trendy breakfast spot! With good food. Down side it's expensive for what it is! It was also very crowded and to a while to get served and even longer to get our food! ‚Ä¶
140,Teds place, 1 star ,2 years ago,Saturday was my 2nd time at this place ordering lunch. I had a monster croque monsieur with eggs benedict. The saus was so sour that i couldnt eat it. My friend her eggs where overcooked. ‚Ä¶
141,Teds place, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Trendy spot, lovely decor. Philly cheese streak sandwich was a food high point of the weekend! Prices are a little high and portion sizes could perhaps be a little bigger. Check out the little antiques shop next door after lunch."
142,Teds place, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Actually think its overrated, normal coffee, breakfast and service. Wouldn't recommend"
143,Teds place, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good breakfast spot! Nice place, easy going staff. Try it."
144,Teds place, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Rude staff, we were with a group, although on the phone they said they would have a table for us. They didn‚Äôt. Although most tables were free. The girl was acting pretty arrogant and annoyed. Service üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº. ‚Ä¶"
145,Teds place, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Chicken avocado amazing!! Totally worth the hype!
146,Teds place, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing interior, friendly staff, fast service, great food, and great coffee. This was one of the best brunches I've ever had. The place is also in a more quiet area of Amsterdam. There is wifi available."
147,Teds place, 2 stars ,6 years ago,This place is very average. The croissant was not fresh and the food was generally uninspired. Coffee was run of the mill. There are much better places to brunch in Amsterdam. I'm guessing the four 5 star reviews for this place are friends of the owners. Won't go back.
148,Teds place, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Firstly it took 15 minutes to get a menu, then when we ordered they were out of hollandaise sauce (it‚Äôs on 1/2 the brunch dishes). Then it took 45 minutes to come out and they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have any more poached eggs‚Äù so they made scrambled ‚Ä¶"
149,Teds place, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Simply superb! Got a chicken avocado sandwich and a side of curly fries that were absolutely amazing! Being on vacation, I also got hot chocolate with some Bailey's to top it off. The friendliest staff I ever encountered in Amsterdam - they ‚Ä¶"

151,Teds place, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Having visited before, my friends and Were convinced about coming here for a boozy bday brunch. But with 8 people, we knew we‚Äôd better call ahead that week. ‚ÄòNo reservations on weekends‚Äô ok that‚Äôs fine ‚Äòbut just come early and we will be ‚Ä¶"
152,Teds place, 1 star ,4 years ago,"No service, dirty tables, apparently there were 4 other guests waiting before me to get their orders in. If I didn't get the waitresses attention I don't now how long they would've waited. Realized she hadn't gotten any of the patrons in ‚Ä¶"
153,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This has been a breakfast staple since we found it on our first holiday in Amsterdam. Very cute and chic. Great coffee and breakfast. Would recommend to visitors looking for a good bite to eat!
154,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Strangely one of the view places in Amsterdam that opens up at 8.00 for breakfast! ‚Ä¶
155,Teds place, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Wonderful place, nothing fancy but the food is excellent! and the staff friendly. Eggs Benedict and a glass of of Chablis.. perfect lunch!"
156,Teds place, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The Eggs Benedict on a croissant is a great idea! Coffee was really nice and the staff are really friendly as well. Unfortunately all these things mean it is usually quite busy, but definitely worth it!"
157,Teds place, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We stopped here last week for breakfast while visiting and loved it! The food was great, the staff was friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere/decor was cute and cozy. I almost convinced my husband to return for a second visit within our 36 hour trip!"
158,Teds place, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place but I expected more, a bit overpriced. Staff was not very customers oriented."
159,Teds place, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food and service,  but you get squeezed in like laying hens (like at many places in the city). Less than 30 cm distance to the next table! No private sphere."
160,Teds place, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Kind staffs, and good vibes. You can sit at the terrace but you need to make a reservation in advance."
161,Teds place, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Surprisingly large inside with a extensive menu that will leave you weighing your options for quite some time. Food was excellent, juices and coffee could improve. Service is okay given their workload (busy!), but it is sort of chaotic."
162,Teds place, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"+ Friendly fast service
+ Very fast food (5minutes)
+ nice music ‚Ä¶"
163,Teds place, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Lovely sunny outdoor seating, but also lovely and light and bright inside.  Friendy and helpful staff. Definitely a great spot for breakfast - a true breakfast menu, not just open sandwiches!"
164,Teds place, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good simple food. Service was a little disorganized.
165,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was a dream for brunch. Something for every one, i had the eggs in purgatory and they were delish. Cheesy bread is to die for. Service was fab. Toilets very clean (my mum wanted me to include that bit). All round fab place!"
166,Teds place, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Went to Amsterdam with my boyfriend and this happened to be our favorite caf√©! Location is perfect and is close to Vondelpark. Staff was cheerful and the menu card put a smile on our faces with its creativity. The food and drinks were just as great and without being overpriced!
167,Teds place, 5 stars ,7 months ago,A great place for a brunch and a perfect made coffe.
168,Teds place, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favorite breakfast and brunch spots near Jordaan.  I sometimes crave the Eggs Norwegian and French Toast, so it's a treat when I'm here. Coffee is mediocre here tbh, but the Mimosas and Bellinis are prepared nicely."
169,Teds place, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I had a breakfast: croissant with butter and strawberry jam and cappuccino.
The service was a bit slow because of the large amount of clients. Very very good breakfast and nice staff"
170,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a must go to! Love the place. The food, the ambiance, and, above all, the team that works there. Everyone is so friendly. And the Owner?!? She is awesome! Running around all the time and making sure everyone is enjoying.
Will def go again, and again...don‚Äôt miss this place!"
171,Teds place, 2 stars ,a year ago,The service was really slow and the French toasts were nothing special. Dry and lack of flavor. Instagramable but in real life it‚Äôs not worth it.
172,Teds place, 1 star ,3 years ago,The service is horrible. The manager lady does not know how to treat guests. We were a group of 7 and wanted to sit together. We asked the waitress if we can move 2 tables close one waitress said sure but the manager lady came out of no ‚Ä¶
173,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious breakfast burritos and very friendly and polite staff. Flat white was lovely. Clean seating environment and toilets too. Worth a visit.
174,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cool vibe. Good coffee. Good value.  The brunch was fresh and the waitstaff was happy to make modifications and to let us sit and wait out the rain.
175,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice cousy place, very friendly staff and great brush variety. We're yet to have breakfast at the hotel since we found this place! BTW, try the Ted's club sandwich, it is awesome :)"
176,Teds place, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food good, average coffee but poor service.  Order was not completed correctly."
177,Teds place, 1 star ,3 years ago,Really nice place and food but TERRIBLE service. Don't go with a group of more than 5 people because they get crazy. Instead of finding a solution they just advice you to go away quite rudely onestly. 2 hours to eat and we had to order separately to avoid ordering 7 plates at a time.... Sorry but I will never go back.
178,Teds place, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Service so bad that they apologise for it in advance on the menu. One man taking orders, seating customers, and clearing tables in a packed place. Customers coming in and just standing in the middle of the restaurant not knowing where to ‚Ä¶"
179,Teds place, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"When you order poached eggs, you expect poached eggs, not hard boiled. And being one of the main dishes for a brunch cafeteria, this thing cannot pass. All other people around had same problem btw.. ‚Ä¶"
180,Teds place, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Very overhyped breakfast place. They use too much vinegar for their poached eggs and they didn't taste good. Portion sizes are OK and coffee is good too.
181,Teds place, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The food quality is good, as is the taste. The portions are small though, and quite expensive relative to the amount you get. It's still madly popular though, so going early is your best bet to get a seat."
182,Teds place, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. Food was excellent and was hard to decide as the menu was big with lots of great things to choose from. They also do brunch all day
183,Teds place, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Nice location and very good food. Pleasant service as well!
184,Teds place, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is super good, specially the poached eggs. Service is nice, and the joint itself is cosy. If place is busy, it becomes too loud and waiting for dishes might also feel too long."

186,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food in a lovely atmosphere with no pretention. Also a great range of alcohol. What's not to like? The Croquet Madame is highly recommended. üëå
187,Teds place, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice breakfast and cute decor ! Super busy but we waited at the bar and it was fine. Waitress was really rude though
188,Teds place, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very cute and cozy place to eat brunch! Food was delicious, and the price was very reasonable. The orange juice tasted really fresh. I would come here again."
189,Teds place, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We waited for 30min for a waiter to come, they ignored us while serving the people around us that sat down after us, when we asked to be served the waiter waved to a menu on a different table and left. ‚Ä¶"
190,Teds place, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great brunch options, friendly service and great location.  We tried the eggs Benedict and the banana and Nutella pancakes and both were delicious.  Definitely coming back."
191,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Of the 4 dAys we stayed in Amsterdam. We went here on thursday friday and saturday. Even though the place is packed. The young man and woman running this place made sure on all 3 days we were at home! Amazing vibe and lovely choises of food!
192,Teds place, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Between the witty signs on the wall and the delicious menu, TED balances a quirky vibe with amazing food. Very impressed and, more importantly, loved my experience here. Can't wait to come back."
193,Teds place, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Fantastic place to start or restart your day. Go for the Bloody Mary brunch and the Philly steak. Well worth its price and will pick you right up again.
194,Teds place, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic brunch venue. The coffee, eggs, bloody Mary and gins are perfect. Chic interior with a focus on excellent food. Not to be missed."

204,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A gem of a cafe, offering brilliant food, lovely coffee and speedy service. Would recommend to anyone looking for a brunch style meal, or those with only limited time."
205,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely restaurant on a gorgeous quiet street
206,Teds place, 1 star ,3 years ago,Terrible service (takes around 1.5 hours to find a table order and your food is not ready) . Extremely crowded and no waiting list for a table. Only 2 people serving 60 people inside. Waste of money and time.
207,Teds place, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Young fun brunch place in ams. Not the best brunch in the world but far from the tourist traps scattered around town. If you are looking for a lazy brunch close to the park look no further!
208,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Everything I tried was way above average. Coffee is also good. This might be the best breakfast place in Amsterdam.
209,Teds place, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Definitely one of my favorite brunch places and I think one of the few that offers all day long brunch! Eggs with salmon and avo is my top choice.
210,Teds place, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The staff was kind and good was delicious, will be back!"
211,Teds place, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very long waiting time for below average and pricy food. Waiter forgot half of our order and seemed not interested in taking the order in the first place. First and LAST time to come here. Terrible experience!

215,Teds place, 2 stars ,2 years ago,They brought us a salad with raw chicken inside. We sent it back. They brought it immediately back saying that they checked with the chef and this is how it is SUPPOSED TO BE. Are you kidding me?
216,Teds place, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Today I had breakfast there and must say that I will come back for sure!
217,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very Nice place in a beautiful historic street.

218,Teds place, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"The food is very average to mention it ,the worst cappuccino i ever had .Stuff is friendly"
219,Teds place, 1 star ,4 years ago,We were seated and the waiter took our order without mentioning that there are massive delays for the food. Waited more than 1.5 hour for breakfast.
220,Teds place, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I came here on a Saturday with a group of friends and despite free table space, we were turned away as a group of 6. Apparently no more than 4s on a Saturday! Seems ridiculous that we would have been seated if we'd walked in as 2x groups of 3."
221,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Definitely one of the best Eggs Benny in town. The personnel are very international and all very warm and friendly. Highly recommended.
222,Teds place, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Service was good, but a little snooty and pretentious.  Coffee was good. Poached eggs were undercooked with the whites still clear, runny, and cold."
223,Teds place, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A bit noisy and crowded, but still worth visiting for weekend brunch and mimosas! Really enjoyed the food and quick, friendly service here. Thanks, TEDS!"

226,Teds place, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Wow, their menu contains everything you might want for lunch/brunch so choosing one dish might be difficult! They understand hospitality and hoe to run a place like this! A must-go..."
227,Teds place, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Staf very rude. Not child friendly at all. Restaurant was half empty and the staf complained that our buggy is taking up to much space if other customers want to come in.
My last time in this place!!!"

235,Teds place, 1 star ,a year ago,worst nightmare.waiting for my order 1.5 hour.and finally a very bad attitude waiter comes and said to me this is the way we work if u r in a hurry go some other place.not even sorry.funy is he is the manager.
236,Teds place, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Solid brunch place with reasonable prices, bright atmosphere and friendly service. Recommended!"
