0,Caf√© Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I really liked this place. We met here before going on a canal cruise. The staff is super friendly and they play really good music. I would definitely go back to this spot for a beer.
1,Caf√© Wester, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place to hang out / kill time. Laid back, decent menu and drinks. Staff is friendly enough. Nothing to go out of your way for, but solid and trustworthy.
If there's a game (match) on, then it'll be on here."
2,Caf√© Wester, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Caf√© Wester is a vibe nice energy great music service also great not much sitting place inside, tables outside too"
3,Caf√© Wester, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Tall Finnish girl was so sweet. Great bar!
4,Caf√© Wester, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best caf√© in the Center. Happy sweet staff, hot owner and one of the best views"
5,Caf√© Wester, 5 stars ,7 months ago,A Nice place on canal with friendly staff. üëçüèº Recommended.
6,Caf√© Wester, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Awesome outdoor serving. Good service. Good food and beer. Nice view. Just awesome.
7,Caf√© Wester, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely Pizza filled the spot for lunch. Waitress gave the impression customers were an inconvenience however sadly.
Also, hand hygiene leaves something to be desired. If you don't mind your carrot cake being handled"
8,Caf√© Wester, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool bar, they also have three screens if you're looking for a spot for the football matches. Service wasn't so fast but their staff was friendly. In the summer days, they also have a terrace next to the canal with a perfect view. So enjoy!!"
9,Caf√© Wester, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The only reason I stopped at this cafe was because it was the meeting spot for the canal cruise I was going to take.  I didn't eat (as I had just has a snack somewhere else) but I did get a drink and stared longingly at the food around me ‚Ä¶
10,Caf√© Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great little cafe bar with outside seating and lovely views
11,Caf√© Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place for a drink along side a canal. This was a meeting point for the Dam Boat Guys tour. Thomas, our bartender was very attentive and friendly. We came back 2 hours later after the tour and Thomas greeted like regulars asking we wanted another round remembering all 4 of our drinks"
12,Caf√© Wester, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Smack bang in the middle. Not good, not bad. It has a great location on the canal, but the seats are uncomfortable and crammed together. Drinks are good, but a bit expensive. The service when you could find them was good, but they were seldom outside. A few small changes could make this place great."
13,Caf√© Wester, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent place located across from the Anne Frank House. Service is a bit slow, but the views are nice. The Holtkamp cheese croquet was not very good in my opinion, though I don't know if it tasted the way it should - I've never had one before. My wife truly loved her chicken sandwich, though. The plain pizza was not good, though."
14,Caf√© Wester, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Was our first and last stop on our trip to Dam. Very friendly waiting staff and decent drink prices for the area. Amazing bitterballen and cheese sticks too! They were to die for. Will definitely be coming back next time :)

Price is Fair"

17,Caf√© Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere, meet friends and neighbors over some beer and bitterballen anytime of the year. Weekends get a little crowded, but that‚Äôs perfect for a party! Great location on the Prinsengracht, in the heart of Jordaan."
18,Caf√© Wester, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great pub/bar with good service and a nice atmosphere. A good local bar that I still would recommend to tourists. Worth a stop if your in the area!
19,Caf√© Wester, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very very ugly. I asked them to offer me some water from the tap. They filled  a glass in where they washes the dishes. Offer me the glass while it was full of dish washing Liquid. While it was dripping. I was shocked.  They did not even try to apologize. I still can not believe it..
20,Caf√© Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great Bar! Awesome for a quick drink and a bite! Try the pizza!

It‚Äôs not Napolitan but is great! ‚Ä¶"

23,Caf√© Wester, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I would have given it more stars-the location is good, the toilets were fine, decor traditional brown pub. But the barman was not on it. He didn't know what brandy is and when pointed out he poured me about 6 measures til I shouted stop. Of ‚Ä¶"
24,Caf√© Wester, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Looked good and spacious inside.
25,Caf√© Wester, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Stopped in for a coffee when we had time to kill before climbing Westertoren. Not much to say since we didn't try any food there, but service could have been better. Our waitress seemed a little rude, like she hated her job and hated life. There are tons of cafes in Amsterdam. You're better off picking a different one."
26,Caf√© Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great little canalside bar. Small but excellent range of beers, same for the menu. Lots of seating opposite the bar, right next to the canal."
27,Caf√© Wester, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Needed a little walking break. Stopped for a beer and a snack. Friend ate apple pie (delicious) with coffee. I had beer and small pizza (pretty darn good). Service was good. Would go back.
28,Caf√© Wester, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Ordered a smoothie which they did not have. Then ordered a Fanta which I got in a dirty glass (got lipstick on it). My friend ordered a bloody mary and had to make it himself apart from mixing the vodka and the tomato juice. The staff also ‚Ä¶

35,Caf√© Wester, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Stop! In a time when everyone is taking precautions you are still using your hands to add ice to a drink, the hand dryer doesn‚Äôt work in one of the toilets and no hot water to wash ones hands!"
