0,Waaghals, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice cozy record store right in the centre of Arnhem. The shop owner was very friendly. There are three turn tables where you can listen to your records as well. You can find new and used vinyls and CDs here. Do check it out.
1,Waaghals, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly personnel. Many bargain offerings of great artists. both second hand and new selections. Vinyl and cd's. All genres. Lack of focus results in a patchy collection on offer. Of interest to people on a string or persons starting out as music collector.
2,Waaghals, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Tastefull vinyl selector. I came home with some jazz and world and realized the media was still in plastic protection sleeves! Nice !!
