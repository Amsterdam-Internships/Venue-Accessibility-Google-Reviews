0,Down Town Burger, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,Food and taste 4*.. ambience 5*. Speaks English perfectly when you oder! Good place to  dine- in. Enjoy the great music. Had great outdoor seating with the great view of busy streets.
1,Down Town Burger, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"The food was not fresh, it was not good. The old salad used in the burger took the taste away from the burger. The fries were good. A place called Downtown burger has only 3 choices of burger. The rest were fish and salad, pasta , etc...
Awesome location by the way."
2,Down Town Burger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great lil place, had one of the juiciest burger with chips(fries) here, staff at reception was really friendly although the interaction with the waitress was a bit strange but I highly recommend burgers here."

4,Down Town Burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice restaurant for burgers and other dishes like typical german Schnitzel. Ita a small place but still never a problem to find a seat. Friendly and helpful staff, with great service. Location is next to Red Light District which is very handy if you stay in a hotel nearby. I recommend this restaurant to anyone!"
5,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Really bad service, need to be more friendly and customer oriented, very cheap quality food and at the end, they were confident enaugh to ask for a tip.
Stay. Away. from this place."
6,Down Town Burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Well, nice and friendly staff but that isn't all. Mediocre burger, got a one with some sliced beef. Not that tender och for that matter not enogh for that price. Good fries."
7,Down Town Burger, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Just delicious we had our perfect diner and the personal was helpful and friendly
8,Down Town Burger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was decent, pretty good I would say. The fries where good, the burger was a bit overcoocked, would have prefered it a bit more rare. The service though was subpar. Had to ask 3 times for the check before I actually got it."
9,Down Town Burger, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very kind and wonderful people the food was delicious with no doubt

12,Down Town Burger, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"The food was okay but not really good. The variety of dishes for vegetariens is very small, but for meat eaters big. The Hygiene was okay, but not great. We wouldn't go there a second time."
13,Down Town Burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best burger in the area. Don't mess about go straight for the Angus 300gm with bacon & cheese
14,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Slow for food to come.  Bread was the most dry and chewy gluten loaded I have experienced in Europe, had to eat the salad and meat and leave the bread.
And coffee weak and pale.
Disappointing."
15,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,6 months ago,The food is not fresh at all. Although the place is good and well situated. Won’t come back

20,Down Town Burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Ordered the pull pork burger. Tender and marinated well with the BBQ sauce. And it's huge.
21,Down Town Burger, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Service left something to be desired. Front staff throughout our meal reached across our table to remove and replaced a menu as trying to show passing pedestrians without any acknowledgment or apology for interrupting our meal (let alone …
22,Down Town Burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great little place to eat close to the centre. Lovely burgers highly recommend, initially had a bad experience when we first arrived was served by a very rude lady. Then we had a different server who changed our whole experience and the food was great. If you go hopefully you wont get served by the same lady I did."
23,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Absolutely terrible service. The dark haired waitress was bubbly and friendly, however the other one clearly doesn't want to be here and goes out of her way to make everyone else feel the same. For a burger joint, I find it very intriguing …"

25,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I appreciated it was open that late (around midnight). BUT : whereas fries were fine, the burger was really NOT good : the bread was lame, the meat not tasty & the guy dared to charge 1€ extra for some cheese I even didn't FEEL. When I told …"
26,Down Town Burger, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Not so good food
27,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Terrible. They messed up our ticket for two of us, and put in an order for 6 people who sat after us, so we end up waiting 40min or longer.
When the burger comes out, it is completely over cooked and gross, I wouldn’t …"
28,Down Town Burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great location and service, but what really steals the show is the massive burger. It's huge... Like the size of my head. I didnt think I'd be able to finish it, but the bread was so buttery and crisp.. the meat so savoury. All I could do was eat until it was nothing but a fond memory. I guess I'm really off my diet now..."
29,Down Town Burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cheap and cheerful! Big portion of chips and burger was tasty (for the price)

34,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Food not that bad as you could expect, but cheap flirt from the waiter in my boyfriend presence is crazy rude. Don't call anyone 'sexy' at work. BTW most girls will smile because they are polite, not interested. This situation was just inappropriate and embarrassing."
35,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst experience in Amsterdam. If you ask for moustard they'll charge as a sauce. Careful you may pay 3€ for a dip of mustard. The combo thats a burguer + fries + ""salad"" is a big lie. The salad its just what they usually put inside thw …"
36,Down Town Burger, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Cannot recommend. Good location, service was fast to gather the order, however food was not good. Burger was served bone dry and no sauces on the burger. French fries were hot but not dressed with salt or any spices."
37,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We had 2 burger and fries which was really disgusting. we paid 25 euros, for me it is too expensive. ( i miss you berlin) the kitchen was in very dirty condition and service crew dont mind about their personal hygiene."
38,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We went to get a veggie burger, but the whole burger was missing...  it was bread with some lettuce, mushroom and a tomato slice. When we told them about it, they said this was their veggie burger and we had to deal with that.  Moreover, we …"

41,Down Town Burger, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The food is ok and price reasonable. But the waitress attitude was one of the worst I experienced having traveled to many places. She is extremely rude and treat customers based on skin color though she is black herself.
42,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Service was okay, location is good.
Angus Burger tastes like overspiced cheap meat. Burger came without any sauce or ketchup and was dry. Chees on cheese fries was like tasteless goo. NOT RECOMMENDED !"

46,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We give this knok off of a real american diner one star out of 5 simply because of the lack of quality of the food.

47,Down Town Burger, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Not good. not Bad. Pretty average.
48,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The service was nice and kind, but they should delete 'burger' out of their name and place 'burn meat' instead. If you are searching a good burger in Amsterdam go for Burger Bar!"

50,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Worst burger I've ever had. A burger consists of a burger patty, a bun and toppings- pretty simple. Not for Downtown Burger. Because all of this was awful. All the way through, this burger was just wrong. I wish I went to McDonald's …"
51,Down Town Burger, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Very bad place, I ordered a Chouffe and they didn't open the bottle in front of me, I understand why, it was a very bad beer inside. They filled the bottle with beer from the tap. I don't recommand it at all!!!"
