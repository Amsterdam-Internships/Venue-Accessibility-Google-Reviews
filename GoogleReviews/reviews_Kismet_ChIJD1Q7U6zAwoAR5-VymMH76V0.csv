0,Kismet, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Made reservations for this restaurant and had a pretty good time! Service was friendly and knowledgeable. The menu is Middle Eastern influenced with a lot of flavorful and good uses of tart elements (vinegar, pickling, yogurts). The vibe is …"
1,Kismet, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Food so flavorful ! Came here for dinner and they've still got outdoor tables dining. No inside yet but you can go inside to use the bathroom. Definitely get the Fried Cauliflower with yogurt appetizer , it was surprising ! I didn't expect …"
2,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 months ago,I was brought here with two close friends by my son pre Covid. We're senior citizens and have a hard time getting around. They gave us a huge and comfortable table near the front window and we appreciated that. …
3,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I loved this place. Everything was so well done. The persimmon and cucumber dish was absolutely delightful. But the dish I loved the most was the flakey bread (malawach), tomato and soft boiled eggs, that was sooo good. I also really like the orange wine they had on the menu that day."
4,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, overwhelmingly heavy on the oil. I'd almost recommend as place for HALF a meal - pregame with a salad. …"
5,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been to Kismet twice now, and both times had a fantastic experience. Friendly service, simple yet beautiful decor, and the food is just amazing. I tried the tomato and peach salad, tahini spread, roasted carrot, eggplant with grapes …"
6,Kismet, 3 stars ,4 months ago,The high rating is not justified. There were several examples in which the service was inappropriately flippant. The servers try to exude cool but just project aimless arrogance …
7,Kismet, 1 star ,3 months ago,My partner is Persian so I was excited to take him somewhere nice to celebrate. We found this place and assumed it was authentic. Boy were we wrong. Is Kismet good? Sure. The food is very rich. But the portions are tiny and the prices are …
8,Kismet, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Just a poor showing. Tried a wide variety of dishes: all were ‘different’, but none particularly interesting, tasty, well plated, or satisfying. Service was adequate, but cordiality barely managed, and was astounded to be told at the …"
9,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Waited to dine at Kismet for ages and it didn’t not disappoint. The crispy rice with egg yolk was such a highlight. The salads are perfect using quality and seasonal ingredients. Service was perfect!
10,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Came here on a  Tuesday afternoon with no reservation and a group of 5. I didn’t know much before coming here but I was hungry and had just done Soulcycle, so food was at the top of my priority list. …"
11,Kismet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent Mediterranean food with a twist. The chopped eggplant is almost as good as mine. My recipe was from my Romanian mother-in-law who brought her wooden chopping bowl when they escaped to America before the war. I'm taking one star …
12,Kismet, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This place blew me away! I had little to no expectations.  Upon seeing the menu on yelp I quickly noticed that the menu was small and very little options in the area of protien.  Furthermore when we got there we were given the ""snack menu"" …"
13,Kismet, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Some of the best food in LA. And very nice staff. Get the fried cauliflower and the salmon! And the flaky bread. And everything, really."
14,Kismet, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Turkish Breakfast includes green tomatoes, eggs, cucumber with yogurt, olives, dates, and some other dish which I don't remember but was pretty darn tasty (10 o'clock on my picture). It was a nice mixture of tastes and would highly …"
15,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice vibes and friendly staff, original take on Mediterranean cuisine. Loved the carrots and their wine. Rather on the pricey side overall."
16,Kismet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Another tapas fusion closes by the Silver lake area. Menu are quite unique with mixed ingredient. Lemon chicken pie, clam, lamb belly, sweet potato and crispy rice are very good.  Overall good quality and service match with their price and 20% build in service charge."
17,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had lunch here and shared three plates. Delicious food! Way beyond my expectations. Everything was seasoned very subtly, I definitely want to come back for dinner."
18,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The picture is of the turnip snack with raw butter. With a rotating menu you never get bored! Just had the rabbit for two and the flavors were exquisit. Flaky bread that you top with tahini and labneh - so buttery and flavorful. The rabbit …
19,Kismet, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Just an overall incredible experience.  Really friendly and fun service, beautiful and delicious food, nice and inviting ambiance.  The food… everything was bright, perfectly seasoned, thoughtful and creative.  We had four people, ordered a …"
20,Kismet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good experience. Staff are super nice. A bit expensive for the dishes. Also they like mixing up sweet with salty stuff and I think that sometimes it doesn't work.
21,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Will post more about the food once I’ve eaten it, but at this point just wanted to comment on the appearance and general feel of the place. …"
22,Kismet, 5 stars ,4 months ago,I and 3 of my girlfriends visited here for the first time.  The food is phenomenal! We will return!
23,Kismet, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Delicious.  I got takeout and the smell walking back to my office promised something amazing, and it was terrific."
24,Kismet, 1 star ,a year ago,"The food is good (albeit a bit pricey). The customer service was lacking, notably in the small things. Asking for tips, it seems a little tacky.
With Social-Distancing comes new challenges. …"
25,Kismet, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Food was delicious and there was a decent amount of vegetarian options.  Minus one star for the beer list, it would be nice to have a middle of the road choice between a 375ml Saison and Modelo.  If you're only going to carry two beers, Modelo seems like a strange choice."
26,Kismet, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"We’ve dined out several times during the pandemic and none have been as enjoyable or delicious as our dinner at Kismet. The ambience, the service, the fusion of flavors, and the attention to detail set this place apart from the rest."
27,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 months ago,This place is awesome  the food and the way they treat you.   You feel you are in Mediterraneo amazing views
28,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Absolutely delicious — great flavours and pairings. Highly recommend kismet!
29,Kismet, 1 star ,7 months ago,"THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT COVID - worst experience ever. I've been going there for years and unfortunately had to cancel a dinner reservation for 2 at 1pm the day of. I had Covid symptoms so I didn't really have a choice, yet they wouldn't hear anything and charged me $40! Looks like they're ok with having sick people at their restaurant..."
30,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food and great service. When you want brunch that is a little different give this place a try. Must try the tahini-nutella toast. Only downside is the parking situation or lack of BUT worth it for the food!
31,Kismet, 4 stars ,a year ago,I like the atmosphere and the food in this place. But I don't think they should call themselves Mediterranean food. Anyone who's been to a real Mediterranean place will realize that this is fusion. Their portions are very small but food is tasty. It's one of those places I would go for snacks and a drink with a friend.
32,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Kismet... oh how I was crushin on you from a far. You did NOT disappoint. The service was good but not great, the food was BOMB."
33,Kismet, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The menu and service were above our expectations. I absolutely enjoyed the ambience of this place. Excellent restaurant to take my family out for dinner.
34,Kismet, 1 star ,7 months ago,"I was really exited to try out Kismet but the service of the employees really left a poor taste in my mouth. Condescending and dry, the whole human interaction was sub-par. A real shame when poor service ruins good food."
35,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Great place to have Mediterranean food.
The fish is fresh and delicious."
36,Kismet, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Love this spot! Their outdoor seating is wonderful. I can't think of one dish I've had that missed.
37,Kismet, 3 stars ,a year ago,Been trying multiple mom and pops chicken places and this one is the best so far! The chicken is crispy and full of flavor and  bread is such a good match with it! Must try it with the honey the combination of sweet and spicy is so good! …
38,Kismet, 5 stars ,11 months ago,So happy they just reopened outdoor dining. It felt very safe and the staff was super friendly. …
39,Kismet, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"We are outside, as it’s all outside dining due to a Covid. The meal took a long time,
For was under whelming and overpriced. Service was so so. It was all just, eh."
40,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It’s one of the best restaurants here and boasts a superb location and even better food. The portions are very generous, and customers love eating the crabs taken directly from fresh tanks. This restaurant seems to be a favorite for …"
41,Kismet, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Amazing food and lovely staff. They seemed a bit short staffed as service flow had a few starts and stops.
42,Kismet, 4 stars ,a year ago,"And exciting and much needed new addition to the neighborhood. Really tasty food. Not the best you've ever had, but better than almost anything within a two block radius. Very helpful service and high-quality food. And they have Sapporo on tap!"
43,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really cool spot.
Staff was awesome and super nice.
We absolutely LOVED the cauliflower, mushrooms and the fried rice dish(the egg …"
44,Kismet, 2 stars ,a year ago,"This review is for a Kismet Rotisserie. Ordered chicken Pita, got home and it was veggie Pita in the bag. Ticket stapled to the bag said chicken ... So there's that. Also tried the chicken soup. Good ingredients, but WAY too salty. Overall the food does not seem to be made with much care."
45,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,Lovely place for a cozy date! All the food was fresh and tasted wonderful. I couldn't ask for more! It was a nice experience for me for the first time. Highly recommended for both meetings and friends as well for having an excellent atmosphere. Try their services and you won’t regret it for sure. Thumbs up! Tremendous!
46,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Thank you so much for your food. It's so fresh and tasty, and when it comes to food, it takes effort and guesswork out of my busy life. The food is AWESOME! You've got a client for life! Thank you very much for giving me the best dining experience."
47,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food! Cozy atmosphere and great service.
48,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,Mediterranean food and the feeling at this location is excellent. nice location to meet with family. i had a cousin come into town and she asked me to go back here. this place has a good atmosphere.
49,Kismet, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Soooo worth the line. Dave's is phenomenal. Delicious, great quality, great service and such fair prices.  Recommend getting the Hot spice level if you can handle your spice and get the slider & tender combo 3. Perfection."
50,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Really delicious food, great menu items and nice outdoor sits"
51,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I like this spot! They offer sensational meals, their menu is decent, The cook in that spot is very trained, I love a lot tasting all their dishes. The dishes are always fresh, the attitude towards the guests  is agreeable. I often go to  this place and I was never unsatisfied. Highly recommended."
52,Kismet, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"The food was spectacular, the service is friendly and attentive. The street is a bit busy for outdoor dining."
53,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,One of my preferred spots for tasty mediterranean food. Service is consistently above par. Prices are decent for the quality. I can see why they have so many great reviews.
54,Kismet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This restaurant is a true gem, serving up a delicious modern take on middle eastern cuisine. Everything that we ate was delicious, but the fried cauliflower and crispy sticky rice stood apart. I would go back to Kismet just for these …"
55,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A clean cut modern atmosphere with a contemporary interpretation of Turkish cuisine meant for the California crowd. I enjoyed every dish that came out as most dishes are best shared. I wanted to give it five stars, however I felt that the …"
56,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,Mediterranean food and service at this location is super good. I really loved this place. Looking forward to returning with my relatives. The place has a great feel to it. Reminds me of a cafe in Chicago I liked to visit.
57,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really fast delivery despite the rain! And the delivery man was very nice. Always appreciate delivery guys on a pouring rain kind of day. The food was great too!! The chicken Adana was perfectly cooked and tasty. Always a favorite!
58,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,It’s rare that I try places and think “oh my god I can’t wait to share this with someone” but this is one of those places. The food was super yummy and even though many find it over priced I found it to be more than worth the money. $30/person for plennnty of delicious food with left overs is a win in my book. 10/10 recommend.
59,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We hadn’t reserved so were seated on the corner of the low bar at the back which was actually very private and comfortable. Everything on the menu looked delicious. Everything we ordered was delicious. We shared 4 or 5 dishes, the jeweled …"
60,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is amazing, but i found the portions of some of the dishes rather tiny for the price. The rabbit for 2 is actually a great deal, comes with rabbit prepared 3 different ways and the unreal flaky bread with labneh and hummus to dip! …"
61,Kismet, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great staff, very nice and helpful. Small portions and high prices leave a bit to be desired but as tasting plates where great.  Super minimal interior that’s borders on bland but the good music and warm staff make up for it and give it …"
62,Kismet, 4 stars ,a year ago,"If you want real, hand made, Italian pasta this is the place for you. Plus they finally have their beer and wine license!!! I eat a lot of Italian food and there are some pretty good places in L.A. but this place, by far, is the best in the …"
63,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Yeah I went at 5:30 just so I could get in, what’s it to ya?"
64,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,flat bread forever
65,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A varied menu full of wonderful flavors made this a really memorable brunch. I couldn't decide what I wanted because it all sounded so appetizing. I look forward to coming back to give the whole menu my attention! Also, the service was warm, informed and casual without being informal or sloppy. Impressive all around."
66,Kismet, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Food was delightful and delicious. Service was very very slow. We sat for 45 minutes and in that time got a single plate (tomatoes and peaches).
67,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy little place with an amazing menu.  Owned by two women, this place is now at the top of my list of favorite places to eat.  The service is so wonderful and friendly.  If you like Mediterranean food, you have to try this place!!"
68,Kismet, 3 stars ,2 years ago,A bit over rated.  It's nice and has a good ambiance.  But so does a lot of other places when you pay this much.  Services are nice now that a 20% tip is mandatorily added.  Two of us with two entrees and two appetizers plus two bottled …
69,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I actually liked this dining establishment, the food is remarkable, as well as the bathrooms were clean. It was a little fridgity indoors, so that was not totally cool. The wait is great. I will most definitely take into consideration …"
70,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Such a great store! They have such a large selection and the way the store is set up makes you want to look at everything! The store is so clean, organized and colorful! …"
71,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I have had to travel to Los Angeles recently for work.  Sometimes it is more convenient to have food delivered to the hotel when traveling.  This is the third time I have ordered from Yahya's.  Each time it has been excellent.  Their …
72,Kismet, 3 stars ,3 years ago,We arrived for our reservation at 7:30 and the table was not ready. We were shown to a standing table which put us out of the way from the front door to wait. Our waiter asked my guest if she would like a beverage. As we were seated about …
73,Kismet, 3 stars ,2 years ago,not really sure what all the hype is on this spot. good menu for sure with nice salads and variety etc but I had a pretty underwhelming experience? the up charge on food here lead you to expect exemplary service but was met with somewhat …
74,Kismet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Kismet's menu is diverse. I liked the many vegetarian options I could choose from. I really enjoyed the beans with labneh sauce and curated scallops. The jewelled crispy rice is okay for me, nothing special although it's one of their …"
75,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this restaurant! But, they add a 20% service charge to the bill to supplement wages. Is this supposed to cover service/tip? The server told me “it’s not exactly meant to cover the tip”. I hate feeling uncertain in these situations. …"
76,Kismet, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Interior was well designed and has great light by the front windows. The menu could use some work. While the food was plated beautifully, it was overly complicated and a few times too salty. On the other hand, the drinks were delicious."
77,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service. All dishes were outstanding!! Cauliflower, tahine with mushrooms (the best!!), feta salad and sunchoke with pancetta. Amazing selection of natural wines although it gets quite expensive when you add the compulsory 20%. Anyway, highly recommend it."
78,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I don't know how I wouldn't go to this place all the time if I lived on this side of town. Bright, clean interior with fresh, interesting dishes. A surprise with every order. Their wine/aperitif based drinks are very refreshing too and make one consider trying to switch to this style of drinking permanently."
79,Kismet, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"A little pricey for what it is, but delicious.
Smallest wine pour ever. Service could have been more pleasant and attentive.  Didn't  care for 20% service charge would prefer old school tipping as incentive for servers to be on their skills."
80,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love it here! Sunday afternoon after 3 is a smaller “snack menu” but everything we got was delicious. The marinated feta is a must as a starter, and get extra bread!"
81,Kismet, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Overpriced Mediterranean food that lacks love and dedication. Poor service, filthy restrooms, and extremely salty dishes. The staff seems to be way to arrogant and dismissive. This is for rich people who have never had the chance to visit …"
82,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I feel weird arguing with Michelin and Beard, but I just wasn't that impressed with the food.  While some of it was wonderful-- the lamb belly specifically -- most of the rest of what we had was pleasant but forgettable. …"
83,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Literally, EVERY BITE I HAD WAS AMAZING. Kismet is innovative and creative in every dish. They play with their food and bring herbs, spices and flavors together that you would not think work well with each other but THEY DO. We went for a …"
84,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food, service snd wine. The space is beautiful and has a great vibe. Fun without being overly precious, cool without pretension. Great people. Food was fabulous. Standouts were the spiced and roasted carrots, and this sounds …"
85,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Exceptional food and service. Every restaurant should have service as Kismet. The food was outstanding! I wasnt sure with as every dish had powerful spices but it worked. Every dish was delicious and complemented well. Going back for desserts soon. Thank you.
86,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Ordered from the ""Daytime"" menu. The Freekeh Polenta and Roasted Red Pepper spread has me planning a return for ""Dinner."" The Rosewater lemonade has just a hint of rose which doesn't overpower. Food is light and satisfying. Don't come …"
87,Kismet, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food at Kismet was fantastic. Which makes it such a shame that the staff were the rudest and most uninterested I’ve met in California. One waitress took our order after an inordinate amount of time with very little enthusiasm, while the …"
88,Kismet, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very tasty, unique spin on middle eastern food. Very nice, clean ambiance and good service. A little pricey, but worth it. They lose one star for overall cost and requiring 20% gratuity. Most places that require gratuity ask for 16% …"
89,Kismet, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Like all restaurants that have jon and vinny's hands on them servers are friendly, positive and attentive. The problem is value for dollar. Food was great for basic Mediterranean dishes, but extremely overpriced (also mandatory 20% service …"
90,Kismet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best dinner in all of LA.  I'm from the East Coast and was traveling to LA to visit a good friend- so was excited about the LA dining scene. My partner and I travel a bit, spending a good deal of time in  US Cities and Europe in search of …"
91,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Hipster central but the food does not disappoint
92,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious! They were able to accomodate us, a walk in party of 2. Mind you it was at the back counter space,  but it was totally fine. The service was friendly and attentive, the sommelier really knowledgeable, the food was tasty, and the ambiance was on par. Definitely recommend."
93,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Always love the rabbit. Such a great place!
94,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,A fav location for delicious Mediterranean food. Visited Sat afternoon. Service is typically great. Prices were decent.
95,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,"mediterranean food, mmm, quality stuff. It was so tasty. I will be back with my friends. Prices were fair for the quality of the food."
96,Kismet, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Nice staff, clean and beautiful environment, my chicken salad was super salty. Over priced menu, they charge 20 percent service charge. So if you eat at a fast food place it is much better."
97,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent spot for quality Mediterranean food. Certainly worth a return visit. The bill was average for the menu. Food is like a restaurant in Louisville I liked.
98,Kismet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Small, intimate spot serving a cross between California cuisine and Middle Eastern. Dishes feel familiar but flavors are well developed. Menu is great for sharing!"
99,Kismet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This is a very fine restaurant.  I think they corked a bad bottle of wine which would be my only complain in an otherwolise 10/10 experience.  Interesting and unique food that is healthy spirited and decadent.  Everything is worth trying on the menu.
100,Kismet, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"It's a cool spot but I wouldn't say the food was amazing. I'm not a huge fan of high end tapas style dining where you have to spend an arm and a leg to just feel full. All in all it was a good experience, but I wouldn't say I'd rush back."
101,Kismet, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very expensive and potions are small. It has a super hipster vibe that you can tell your friends you were into before it was mainstream. Dishes are hit or miss. Some are bursting with flavor , other lacking."
102,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"THE TURKISH BREAKFAST IS THE BEST! It's  so very fresh, the dates are sweet and the labneh is lusciously delicious and moist with greens persian cukes.Everything on the plate is a taste experience. …"
103,Kismet, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A bit too plain in flavours for our taste. Good and fresh food, though. Scallops were tasty. Not for small budgets. Cosy ambiance at night."
104,Kismet, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I  went to Kismet to celebrate a friend's birthday so she picked the restaurant. Unfortunately, I have food allergies and and some medical issues which has resulted in a very limited diet. Since all of the food had ingredients that I could …"
105,Kismet, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Upscale hipster vibes. Food was ok, nothing special though (we ordered at least five dishes). Barbari or ""Seeded bread"" for $5? Come on bruh."
106,Kismet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A tad pricey, but the food is absolutely delicious.  I found the plates to be a little small to share for 2 people, but totally want to come back and try the rabbit plate for 2.  Every dish we tried was super savory and worth a re-visit."
107,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,Mediterranean food... super satisfying. Service is awesome even when they are busy. The staff was very welcoming and observant.
108,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my top places for tasty middle eastern food. There was quick, helpful, and friendly service. Feels like a cafe in Phoenix that I enjoyed visiting."
109,Kismet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food here was excellent. And you must try the deserts. We tried three deserts and they were all great. Even my 16 year old, who is a meat eater,  loved this place."
110,Kismet, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Frankly, I don’t know what KISs My ET is."
111,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Completely satisfied every time I done at Kismet. The Malawach is absolutely fantastic, order it immediately. Honestly anything on the menu is phenomenal."
112,Kismet, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Food is good but portions are small.
113,Kismet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Service was friendly!  Making reservations was easy.  A great place, cozy.  Delicious food!   Nice to share smaller plates.   Good drinks"

115,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,Good place for quality Mediterranean food. I can see why they have so many great reviews.
116,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Excellent food, great atmosphere"
117,Kismet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Get as many different plates as your table can support (2 per person is about right) and share everything. It's all delicious and you won't regret it.
118,Kismet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,My go to late night spot. Easily the best and most authentic Mediterranean food in the area. Falafel pita can't be beat.
119,Kismet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place is a fairly interesting taste buds opening experience. It reveals healthy food alternatives with the subtle spices of the Orient. I will be back!!!
120,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is absolutely one of my favorites. The service was friendly and observant. Food is similar to a place in San Francisco I loved.
121,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,What an amazing place! The chicken kebobs pita is to die for and so is the rotisserie chicken! A must eat when in LA!
122,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"mediterranean food, very satisfying. very delicious. the service was very kind and attentive. the bill was decent."
123,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had a very good experience in here with my kid. The food comes fast and the customer service is just good. Prices are reasonable.
124,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best meal in a long time. Outstanding service!
125,Kismet, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great natural, organic selection of plates, good alcohol selection too a bit costly"
126,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's always delicious.  And the service is second to none.  They have an extensive menu, and a great happy hour."
127,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,Mediterranean food... yummy. Filled me up. This place has a cool design.
128,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice brunch place. Good overall quality, mostly nothing that special, but a few outstanding dishes."
129,Kismet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere and great food. Good for a special night out, but personally a little out of my price range. Wonderful place tho"
130,Kismet, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The prices are not cheap (the wine prices are outrageous!), but the food is delicious and anything of this quality is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The flaky bread with tomato and labneh is a must order!"
131,Kismet, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is ok. Hot drinks sucks. 20% included....

And they also let you give additional tip lol so nice..."
132,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a pleasant meal here, the service was good. Mediterranean food lovers will be satisfied!"
133,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Always a favorite. Tho they took the broccoli labne toast off the menu and replaced it with an underwhelming cauliflower zaatar toast.
134,Kismet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice.
135,Kismet, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Great flavor but affected service.
136,Kismet, 5 stars ,a year ago,Ok place for delicious Mediterranean food. The bill won't break you.
137,Kismet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. The staffs are helpful too."
138,Kismet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really good retro Turkish breakfast food with a cool Los Angeles vibe. The Shakshuka is really good and a must try!
139,Kismet, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Trendy food stop with pretentious prices. Shakshuka tasted like sauce was heavy on the Heinz. Won't be back.
140,Kismet, 1 star ,3 years ago,3/4th of the restaurant was empty and strangely they couldn't seat us... the wait for the bar was over 1h at 6pm. Very disappointed doesn't even come close. Don't even want to try to come back here.
