I am always satisfied with the portion & price & quality of food here and never disappointed. The complimentary sauce and pita bread that they serve are also extremely tasty, love love love this place!"
1,Bir Tat, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The food here is something I always look forward to when I am visiting Amsterdam. No matter where in the city I stay I make a point to come by and eat. The portions are great and the fries and garlic sauce is like no other. Friendly and busy atmosphere - would definitely recommend.
2,Bir Tat, 1 star ,a month ago,"I ordered a dish and someone try to make money from me, asked 2,5 euro for salads, which are always included FOR FREE!!!
YOU WANT TO MAKE CLIENTS, OR YOU WANT LOSE THEM?
Very disappointed!"

4,Bir Tat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tried the sharma with chicken. Good food. Very crowded, so the food takes some time. Which is why we overstuffed ourselves with the bread before the meal comes out. Love the chili and garlic sauce too. Would certainly come back again."

10,Bir Tat, 1 star ,9 months ago,"This was my favorite shoarma place, however they increased their prices insanely after the lockdown. Dishes are increased by €3!! €19 for a shoarma schotel with chicken wings! It was €16 before. The food is overpriced.. bye Birtat."

13,Bir Tat, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Limited items in the afternoon despite what the menu shows. Good size portions and nice salad included. Food is pretty greasy but tasty. We liked the eggplant with ground lamb best, the chicken with potatoes was pretty bland. White beans with small lamb chunks was good too.
Service good."
14,Bir Tat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is as close as it gets for a Turkish restaurant in Amsterdam to a good one in Turkey. Start with a soup. Highly recommend the lentil and chicken soup. The grill choices are tasty and large. Pricing is very good for value. The staff is very friendly and patient. Even on a crowded day the service is fast.
15,Bir Tat, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food and good service. It is always a busy place here, abd that already says something about the quality of food and service. In case you are a meat lover try the mixed grill, won't be disappointed. And for starters always ask them to warm up the bread, it does magic"
