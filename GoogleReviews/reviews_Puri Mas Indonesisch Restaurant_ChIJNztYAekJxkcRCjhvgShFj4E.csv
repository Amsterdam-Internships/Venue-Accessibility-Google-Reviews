0,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What an awesome experience!! We got the traditional family style meal and split it between my wife and I. Great Ethiopian food and I‚Äôm not a big fan of the food style. ‚Ä¶
1,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hands down best Indonesian place in Amsterdam. The staff are friendly, warm, and proud to show you their food and culture. Every plate of food is exquisitely prepared with thoughtfulness and care. Also their homemade hot sauce is probably ‚Ä¶"
2,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I'll start off by saying that the food was definitely great, and there was a good variety of dishes. Service was also excellent and very friendly. My main issue was that there simply wasn't enough food. Choosing the 'rice table' option (‚Ç¨25 ‚Ä¶"
3,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This was my first Indonesian meal and I loved it! We had the rice table and were pampered by the staff while enjoying a tasty meal. The restaurant might be in a very touristic street, but that doesn‚Äôt diminish the quality of the food. A true recommendation!"
4,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It caters to the tourists. It's nice, tilting toward a more refined experience. I had hoped for something more authentic and raw with less frills and rediculous food. ‚Ä¶"
5,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was excellent, staff was awesome...  took us in last minute with no reservation.  Staff recommended the Rijsttafel Puri Mas, which seemed excessive when it was served, but it was the perfect amount of food and we ate every last bite!  Would definitely stop in if I'm ever in Amsterdam again!"
6,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely excellent food and service. To eat such a traditional Indonesian meal like this was eye opening for my travel to Amsterdam.  It became dinner for the rest of the trip everyday.
7,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,very good food.   the puri mas specials come in 4 price levels.  i got the cheapest and was very good. they need to serve water as some dishes are very spicy. see the pictures they serve small portions of many dishes.
8,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My mom is Indonesian and because of the Dutch influence she wanted to try some authentic Indonesian food while we were here. This place tastes just like the food in Indonesia. You can order small plates so you get to try a lot of different things. All the food was delicious and filling.
9,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing Indonesian food. We enjoyed every mouthful of the food. It is beautifully presented. The waiting staff are so lovely and extremely helpful if you have nwver been there before. It has been the best restaurant we have eaten in in Amsterdam
10,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Rijsttafel, Indonesia's answer to the degustation menu. Just brilliant and done beautifully at Puri Mas. The food is tasty, the service is amazing, the location is right in the centre and the atmosphere is very upbeat. I know its not local, but I'm glad is strayed away."
11,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Slightly different flavors than Indian or Thai curries... more coconut and citrus, less spice. That's my first impression from my foray into Indonesian cuisine. Order the ristofel if you want to try a little of everything. You can get 3, 4 or 5 courses gluten free. Starts at ‚Ç¨22 per person. You can also order a la carte meals."
12,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Low stars because this place is very overpriced. We got the set menu for 2 (the 3rd most expensive option) came out to 90 euro for 2. The satay was good (except the shrimp one was bland). The rice was good and the salads were good, but ‚Ä¶"
13,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,5 years ago,We ordered the Menu Ikan (fish based) and the Rijstaffel special - both were delicious and enough food for two people to be sufficiently stuffed. Particularly liked the lamb in cinnamon/star anise & the green beans in coconut curry sauce. Bueno.
14,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for Indonesian food (I think, have only eaten it in foreign countries.).
Great food and the riistafel (rice table) is a must! ‚Ä¶"
15,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,When visiting Amsterdam we were looking for some culinary experience where Indonesia would be involved. We ran into this place and it was great! We learned that ‚Äúrijsttafel‚Äù is something that is being eaten in Netherlands and we were pretty ‚Ä¶
16,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My friend and I got the rijsttafel special (the smallest version). More than enough food and a lot of variety! Food was pretty good and there were solve unique flavors. Service was quick, attentive, and friendly. After looking at multiple places I think this is one of the most affordable rijsttafel in the city at ~20‚Ç¨."
17,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food was amazing. Rice table was a really good way to try lots of different dishes. Staff were so helpful. Honestly one of the best meals we had on our stay.

21,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wanted to try the rijsttafel of Amsterdam, but being vegan, there were not many options. This place delivered!!

22,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, great service and atmosphere, fresh interior."
23,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars, I would! This is by far the best meal we‚Äôve ever had in our life!! My husband & I both agree on that! The service was wonderful. Friendly & helpful staff!! The sharing platters were so full ‚Ä¶"
24,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Just excellent from start to finish.  Service was top notch.  My husband and I shared the rijsttafel royal and the flavors were unique and delicious.  We are not a fan of spicy and they substituted out the spicy meat stew for fish.  Such an excellent meal, we will be back!"
25,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Upon arrival we were greeted by a very kind young man who opened the door for us & showed us to our table straight away. The waitress explained the whole menu to us and we were left to decide what we wanted. We chose the ‚Ç¨22.50 (each) ‚Äòset‚Äô ‚Ä¶
26,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely loved this place. The service was fantastic and the food was delicious. I loved that you got to try a little bit of everything with the rice plate, and almost all of the dishes were simply delicious. My girlfriend who‚Äôs a picky eater loved it too! Neither of us had ever been to an Indonesian restaurant before."
27,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Incredible food! Possibly my favourite meal in Amsterdam! We had a veggie and a meat rice table, which were both super tasty. Staff and service were also excellent. Highly recommend!"

30,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service and great food. I really recommend getting the sharing table, it's 22.50 per person but you get loads and lots of different bits to try. It's all very nice, the location is also excellent. Pork in a soy sauce was particularly good, also chicken satay. A must visit."
31,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Flavorful food! Attentive staff. Dinner was a good introduction to Indonesian food. The Rice plates are a good way to try a bit of everything. Our kids 7 to 14 enjoyed the service and cleaned their plates. We also tried Arak which has a character similar to Rum.
32,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best meals I‚Äôve EVER had! I am vegan and my boyfriend is not. The staff was able to accommodate a meal perfectly for the both of us. We also inadvertently left a bag full of gifts there and they responded immediately to our email inquiry and held the bag for us to pickup the next day. Highly recommend.
33,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,An absolute find in a busy tourist area. This little upstairs restaurant is comfortable and stylish. We were welcomed and seated at a lovely table with crisp linen and the menus explained. We chose a rice set meal which included a number of ‚Ä¶
34,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good food. Great service. A fantastic experience. IF YOU HAVE PEANUT ALLERGIES... THIS IS NOT FOR YOU ‚Ä¶
35,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Ok if you need an Indonesian food fix.  I think they use pre-packaged mixes and don't cook from scratch.
36,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food and service. Very tasty and convenient the choice of set menu, to taste many different dishes especially if you are not familiar with Indonesian cuisine. ‚Ä¶"
37,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Food was fine, but beware their terrible customer service! We went on our 1st night in Amsterdam and I was excited to try many dishes. I ordered one of the set menus that sounded best, but when it came the dishes weren't what I ordered. ‚Ä¶"
38,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We tried the level 1 rijsttafel.  Excellent food.  Excellent service.  They served 1 bowl of white rice, 1 bowl of fried rice and then arranged a row of I think 8 dishes along a heated tray in the center of the table.  Arranged least spicy ‚Ä¶"
39,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I appreciated a lot this restaurant ! The welcome and the waiters were very very kind with us and our child. For the diner it was perfect, we took the discover menu with the various meet ... lamb and chicken were absolutely FAMOUS.
We'll come back in sha Allah."
40,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My boyfriend and I just had the Puri Mas set meal with multiple dishes. For the price you get so much food, it would have probably served 4 of us, but I was hungry. I really enjoyed the chicken curry soup, but my favourite dish was the ‚Ä¶"
41,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Service can be better. Quite unique place in Amsterdam, gives you a good experience of Indonesian food.
We had our team party here, food and quality is 4 stars, quite mechanical service is something they need to get rid of."
42,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food, very tasty. The speciality is ‚Äúrijsttafel‚Äù or ‚Äúrice table‚Äù, a plethora of small warm and cold dishes that are served with white and fried rice. Vegetarian, vegan and pescatarian options available. Very friendly and efficient service. If you want it spicy, mention that to the staff, otherwise you will get a mild version."
43,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Nice, calm atmosphere away from the street below. Very good service - the staff was very nice and attentive. The food was well prepared and tasted very good. Me and my husband picked one menu each and shared the dishes. We got alot of food and there was a nice variety of flavors and textures. We really enjoyed the whole experience."

47,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent service, but very basic food! I did not find their rice table menu any special. Also, I was surprised that was semi warm (maybe that a tradition but I like my food specially curry warm. I'd not go there again."
48,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"GREAT STAFF and FOOD !! <3
I'm not expert in indonesian cuisine, but I'm pretty sure it was very high quality food. The staff is absolutely adorable, very commercial and smiling people. ‚Ä¶"

52,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Without a booking in midweek on a cold January evening, we aimed for this INDONESIAN specialist restaurant with high hopes that the cuisine I so much love, would equally beguile my wife who never has had the opportunity to experience this. ‚Ä¶"
53,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wonderful, tasty food and great service!!! My boyfriend and I never had an Indonesian cuisine before, but we would definitely recommend this restaurant.  Great restaurant! Definitely worth the visit!"

Food was so delicious and staff very nice, they literally made us feel special :) with my bf we were talking like if we open a restaurant once, we'd send our staff here for an experience!"
55,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Not brilliant as the star rating goes -  the meat dishes are not so fresh; the vegetararian tofu dishes (in the set menu) were terrible & the banana fritters were cold and lumpy. ‚Ä¶
56,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,11 years ago,"When in Amsterdam, always make sure you spend time to go to an Indonesian restaurant, because it was a former colony.  I have visited at least 5-6 different Indonesian restaurants in Amsterdam, and this one is by far the best.  The food ‚Ä¶"
57,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing Indonesian food which is matched by the service. They accommodate for Muslim as they cook the halal and non-halal separately. Just inform them when you order.
58,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Wonderful service, delicious food. We ordered the Rijsttafel, and everything was on point. I recommend getting the vegetarian option - it comes with a fish dish that was my favorite from the evening. Some of the best Indonesian food in Amsterdam, no doubt."
59,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Rice table option is the best way to try a variety of dishes. Great place for people who have never tried Indonesian. Staff is helpful and attentive. Vegetarian options available.
60,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Simply incredible. The tasting menu thing is expensive, but they give you soooo much food. You easily can make three or four meals out of it. I stuffed my face to sickness though and will with leftovers too tho so it'll be two meals for me ‚Ä¶"
61,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 1 star ,4 years ago,"After reading the reviews, I was hesitant but my wife wanted to try it so I gave them the benefit of the doubt.

66,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very gracious & attentive staff. Serene dining room. Ordered the Rijstafel Puri Mas for three, we were served quickly, the food was delicious, and the quantity was just right. If you're near the Rijk, it's a good rijstafel option."

70,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good, very tasty, really worth it! The service was great and attentive, a pleasant change from the rather indifferent service in Amsterdam. Definitely also a bargain given the quantity of food you get."
71,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food and service was great. I traveled with a group and the beer that was included was minimal. Nice atmosphere but steep stairs so if that's a problem this place is not for you.
72,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best Indonesian Restaurant in Amsterdam. Excellent service, very friendly and helpful. Delicious food! Probably the only place where you can get an authentic Rendang and amazing Sate Ayam in the Netherlands, and also a Great selection of Rijsttafel. Recommended, must visit!"

77,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely food. Lovely staff. Restaurant itself feels free of ambience and deserts are an afterthought. But a great place to fill up on well-cooked Indo cuisine.
78,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A lovely restaurant with lovely service. Food was tasty, although perhaps slightly tailored to the Western palate. Quite pricey for what you get. A plate of vegetables and rice is ‚Ç¨16"

82,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I would not suggest if you want authentic Indonesian food. Because all food is adequate to local European taste. ‚Ä¶

84,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Surprisingly, it is possible to find very good food in the alleys around Leidseplein! :^)  Puri Mas serves an excellent and bountiful rijstafel at a very reasonable price.

Everything was delicious. ‚Ä¶"
87,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great restaurant in the Leidseplein area, which is hard to find.

109,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Looked really lovely! Wouldn't serve us because we were just looking to share a dish. Sent us to another Indonesian place downstairs, which was terrible. Not sure why, it wasn't even busy."
110,Puri Mas Indonesisch Restaurant, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Place is quite nice with very nice staff, however we got undercooked chicken with so few chips, that we were leaving hungry at the end of the evening.
