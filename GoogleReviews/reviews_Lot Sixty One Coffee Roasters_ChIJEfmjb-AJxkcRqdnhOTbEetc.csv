The barista is handsome ;)"
3,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Honestly a good cafe, my cortado was creamy and delicious. Cakes are above good and the combination worked extremely well for me as I was after some warmth and coziness after a tad too much of cold winds outside. ‚Ä¶"
4,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Got a cappuccino, a hot chocolate and a blueberry bread. For the most part everything was delicious. My wife really enjoyed the hot chocolate, the blueberry bread was tasty and moist and the cappuccino was good. The reason why I am not ‚Ä¶"

7,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a month ago,Oat cappuccino was really nice! Loaf was delicious!
8,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a year ago,Such a fantastic little find towards the old west of the city. The service was great as the staff were really friendly and kind. The coffee was also prepared relatively quickly. We had an Americano and a Cappuccino.  Both were well made. I ‚Ä¶
9,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice coffee freshly roasted in the store; I take one star out because of the welcoming and the service (while loaded with bags, the server handed to me the cake instead of bringing to the table; that could be more gentle)"
10,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Search no further. Lot61 has the BEST COFFEE IN TOWN!

Being a roaster, they also supply several other coffee bars throughout Amsterdam."

I also order here online often, great coffee and chocolate as well as quick and helpful staff."
12,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I've got a black coffee and a red velvet cake. The coffee is intense, but not bitter. Rich perfect flavor just as I love it. The Red Velvet is pretty good but not exceptional. ‚Ä¶"
13,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I really love this cafe. Very nice interior with downstairs seating, perfect to sit for awhile and get some work done, as I did for a few hours. I came on a Sunday morning just after it opened and already it was busy. The people working ‚Ä¶"
14,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Loved the place but not the coffee :)
15,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Probably one of the best coffees you‚Äôll get in Amsterdam. Go - check it out!
16,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best coffee in Amsterdam. And best croissants and chocolate chip cookies if they have them and you get there early enough. ‚Ä¶
17,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The cappuccino was very good but still has a slight bitterness. Not sure it was because of the roasting. It could be a 5 stars if the cappuccino can have a slight sweetness instead but by far the best I have tasted in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶
18,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Well. It may be a 20 minute walk from the city centre but it is well worth it. They roast they're own coffee but it's absolute premium quality. The interior design can be debated on but it is very trendy nowadays to do it this way. I have ‚Ä¶
19,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The coffee is so nice! I have chosen my latte on Peru beans. Bright fruity and milk chocolate taste. The place is owned by Australian.

22,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"it is a small little cafe that roasts their own coffee at the corner of kinkerstraat and bildersstraat, great to sit outdoors when the weather is good. ‚Ä¶"
23,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lot Sixty One is one of the best artisan coffee shop been experienced in Amsterdam, LSO is a serious coffee roaster shop, no fancy cake and pastry, really focus on making good coffee itself. ‚Ä¶"
24,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best coffees in town!!! Full bodied & rich in taste. They even manage to make latte art with Oat milk (without spoiling the coffee with too much milk)! My favorite coffee houseü§ó
25,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Located in a busy neighbourhood in the west of Amsterdam city centre, Lots Sixty One is usually full of coffee lovers so sometimes it takes a few moments to wait until those super cool but nice staff to get your cup. But it's not difficult ‚Ä¶"
26,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,a month ago,"Don‚Äôt get the fuss.. maybe I just happened to get a bad barista, but the latte I got was completely watered down, and the cake was dry."

31,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Just really good Coffee and carrot cake
32,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The coffee was okay, could have been better. We ordered the cappuccino n a cortado. I dont know if it was the milk or the beans they used. Will try again another time due to the high reviews."
33,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great coffee place. Own roasts and personalised service. Very industrial decor. One criticism is the very steep staircase which isn't very disabled friends but at least there is some seating in the entrance area.
34,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best coffees I have ever had! These guys take it seriously and have understood the art of making fine coffee. What a delight!
35,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very retro-cool little Caf√©/Roastery. Lots of plants, tiles, wood, metal, and of course, excellent espresso drinks. Be careful. The Cortado is a double shot. (And delicious.)"

39,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the better coffee places in Amsterdam where you're lucky to find a spot since it's always busy. This Australian coffee bar has nice staff, great coffee and also some nice things to eat with it. Downstair there are some places to sit, or outside to enjoy the sun or people walking by. And dogs are allowed inside"
40,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful interior design and coffee. Easily one of, if not the best cortados I‚Äôve had to date in Amsterdam! Baristas are also very pleasant and welcoming! It‚Äôs worth stopping in"

46,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 months ago,a decent coffeeshop in Amsterdam
47,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Look no further! The coffee is amazing, may I repeat, amazing, and very reasonably priced. They're serious about it. Location is great, it's packed most of the time but you can still enjoy your coffee outside with a great canal view from the bench."
48,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a gem! Lot Sixty One roasts their own beans and make the most delicious espressos, cappuccinos and flat whites off of it. Lovely interior as well, feels like a hipster place really. You can also buy the beans to re-enjoy the experience at home. Sit outside and enjoy the busy Kinkerstraat while sipping this black gold."
49,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely Cortados! Lot Sixty One is a tiny cafe with some amazing coffees! The only thing I would want - better (read: more comfy) seating :)
50,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good cappuccino while the banana cake was a bit dry. Employees are professional and friendly. I would come again to enjoy the nicely made coffee and may try carrot cake next time.
51,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great coffee, a bit expensive and hipster style for my taste - but still excellent."
52,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the Best speciality in town.

56,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The capuccino was homemade and tasted so good. One of the best of all I'd ever experienced. The banana bread was also good. The staff and place are nice and cosy. You have to walk a little bit to arrive here but it is worth it. The prices are usual for this type of cafeteria.
57,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Loved the decor and the coffee was good. Pricey but that seems to be the norm in AMS. If you're in the area definitely drop by but not one that I would trek across town for.
58,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best coffees in Amsterdam
Friendly staff, nice pastries and cool ambience"
59,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Follow my best reviews on Instagram @comfortcomida

Not my favorite cappuccino but still really good! The brownie, as recommended by one of the baristas, was good."
60,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 months ago,This place lives upto it's expectations. We went there after reading their reviews and their coffee justifies their good name in the city.

63,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a month ago,Excellent coffee!

69,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Best coffee in Amsterdam! Simple menu with 3 coffee options. Love how they creatively used their small space to showcase the coffee making machinery and seat guests.
70,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Potentially got them on a bad day. Hubby's filter was nice and barista was knowledgeable, however my latte was bitter, milk slightly burnt and our blueberry slice was stale."
71,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Best cinnamon buns i've ever had.
The stuff was really friendly."
72,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Not alot of places where you can get a better cup of coffee than here. I am pretty sure they make the best flat whites in the city.

74,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great vibes great coffee. Friendly staff

79,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"This place is a coffee-newbie's delight, and a coffee-aficinado plight. I happen to know my coffee beans.

96,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Expected a bit more for the price paid. Only one type of coffee beens (blend) for espresso...
97,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Homemade roasted coffee beans have a great round flavor. If you are in town, grab a coffee and enjoy.
We bought fresh beans to have a taste of lot sixty one and Amsterdam at home."
98,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great coffee, some small cookies and pastries available. All you need for a small break."
99,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is my favourite coffee place in Amsterdam hands down. There is a number of single origin coffees on tap and the staff is always happy to explain all the details of their latest blend with a smile. You can buy bags of the beans too if ‚Ä¶
100,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great coffee! Also, very nice interior design. Love it!"
101,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best lattes I had while in Amsterdam. Really nice baristas and hip spot that had a small upper level where you order and a tad larger lower section. Also their loaves of sweet bread were so thick and amazing. Get the blueberry one!
102,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a year ago,The most consistently awesome coffee in Amsterdam.  Excellent bean selection as well.  Very pleasant and friendly baristas. Just a great place for delicious coffee.
103,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you see a line to the coffee place it‚Äôs a sight that coffee is top-notch! I never mind to stay extra 5-10 mins to grab a batch brew here. Great selection of beans too, - we constantly buy our coffee for home from here. Baristas know a lot about coffee and give us good recommendations. Their chocolate chip cookie is the best!"
104,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic coffee, loved their single origin americano!"
105,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very good coffee place that fits the devote coffee drinker. Good selection on pour over. They are an excellent roaster and.perhaps the best in Amsterdam(the only good roaster here perhaps). It's in west which makes it sort of a hassle for many but it's certainly worth a try if you appreciate good coffee.
106,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best coffee in town just about. Roast their own beans. Very small place, always busy, seats outside when it's warm enough. Only negative point for me is nothing sugar free to eat, not even a croissant. Great coffee though."
107,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A must visit for coffee snobs, Lot Sixty One has  barista pouring up great coffee with friendly service. The single origin espresso was delicious. Good vibes and a nice canal location make this the place to meet up for a quick coffee, but there is also some indoor space to work."
108,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great coffee in a very adorable unique space. The banana bread was a little dry and tasteless, but the blueberry was very good. The bottom section has very steep steps, so seating is limited if you have mobility issues."
109,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The coffee is above average, it could use more care - especially the hygienic standards during preparation were lacking. The espresso was just too bitter. On the other hand, the space is really nice, and has a good vibrant atmosphere."
110,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good coffee.. and price.. friendly staff..
111,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,10 months ago,No frills. Good coffee. Delicious chocolate chip cookies that can't possibly fit any more chocolate chips. Just the way they should be.
112,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,So the coffee is great without a doubt. The staff is also super frindly. The only negative thing I can say is the seating. This is predominantly a place for take away coffee rather than dit and enjoy working. The seats are designed fire making you uncomfortable so that you will finish your coffee and leave
113,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Coffee was great quality but rather small for the sizes. We were disappointed that the customer service was not consistent with customers. ‚Ä¶
114,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"great coffee and baristas. Unfortunately, quite tiny seating space."
115,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Came here when I was in Amsterdam 2 years ago, I remembered the coffee being delicious so I made another visit this time around. Coffee is still delicious and everybody was also very friendly. It's a must visit for me."
116,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing coffee, super service! Staff was very understanding and inventive in finding a way to avoid using the throwaway cup (and get a beautiful cappuccino into my reusable cup) while still maintaining Covid regulations. üôè"
117,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I loved the coffee here - it's some of the best I've had in for a long time.

118,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best coffee in Amsterdam at this great little spot on the Kinkerstraat. Grab a spot and enjoy inside or outside depending on the weather.
119,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great coffee, great staff, great location, great atmosphere, everything great :))"
120,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great coffee (and choc chip cookies) and great atmosphere. If I lived in Amsterdam this would be local. Melbourne is a little to far too travel even if it is an awesome coffee
121,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best coffee in Amsterdam from East to West and North to South.  A beautiful roastery with very friendly staff! (p.s. unfortunately not a lot of space to sit around)
122,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Just the best coffee in town

There has been no day there that quality of coffee is different. Great personnel friendly all experts. One of the top specialty coffee places in Amsterdam."
123,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best coffee ever, I rode about 5k to get here and worth the trek!"
124,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The coffee is delicious (highly recommend the flat white). Interior is very cute and cozy and the staff is very friendly. I found it a little hard to concentrate though since the music was a bit loud. Also there is only stool seating which ‚Ä¶

126,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious Coffee, friendly staff, a little bit small for the indoor seating"
127,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Was only able to take away as seating was occupied,  but the flatwhite was very well made, and both staff members were very friendly and attentive. Definitely stop in if you're in this part of town and want a pastry and a great coffee"
128,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent coffee and perfect spot to hang out on the weekends. Their coffee beans are also super affordable and service is quick and friendly. Bonus points for delicious treats!
129,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Great coffee, cute place"
130,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best place for coffee in Amsterdam.
131,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"After living in the San Francisco Bay Area for many years I can be a bit of a coffee snob‚Äî I LOVED the cold brew they serve here and the espresso my husband purchased was also top notch. If you need an incredible third wave coffee fix, this is the spot!"
132,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Come here for the drip coffee -- order a black cuppa and enjoy it next to the canal. Their milk-based coffee drinks are also excellent.

133,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very busy coffee place in Amsterdam. The latte is pretty good. Not amazing but can't go wrong here.
134,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This place has high quality coffee beans. This is where we get our coffee to make at home. I never hang out there but it has a cool vibe too. The staff is really helpful in suggesting something you may want to drink in store or at home.
135,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best coffee (place) in Amsterdam? Mmm... maybe :) ~though i'm sure they have the best baristas hehe~ 100!
136,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very lovely coffee place, quite busy though. The coffee you get there is served with smile which is always appreciated:) They also sell coffee beans of different acidity, I tried the espresso one with low acidity and it‚Äôs very good."
137,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great coffee. Managed by Australians. I believe thats why there‚Äôs lots of Australians there. Gezellig atmosphere. I think that it is card only so be aware that your cash will get you nowhere. Good indoor and outdoor seating but not really a caf√© for food. Only some bites to go with your coffee.
138,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Everybody I've taken here is surprised by the coffee, it's really good. There is limited seating, but the ambience is nice. You can also buy coffee beans which they offer to grind for you."
139,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious fresh double shot coffee and equally delicious desserts! The challenge is in finding a place to sit :) You can also buy coffee for home.
Update: they changed something about the coffee they use and the new taste isn't as good as the old one unfortunately."
140,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Australian style coffee bar. One of my favorite coffee places in Amsterdam. Standard is so high and consistent. I always came in only for coffee and this is one of the few places that have never disapointed me. Roast their one beans and ‚Ä¶
141,Lot Sixty One Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the few coffee places that i found batch brew. Burundi was the coffee of the day, taste was great. The cookies were fresh out of the owen, couldn't stop myself just from the beautiful smell.
