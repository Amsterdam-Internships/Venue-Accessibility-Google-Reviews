5,Memories of India, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Mediocre indian restaurant with decent food. Let's start it off with one thing that annoys me about restaurants. In the bathroom there was no hot water. That shows me just how cheap a place is. Now let's go to the food. I ordered saag …

7,Memories of India, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I'm fond of spicy food and they used to make their curries really hot. This is not really happening anymore, which is sad. I always ask for extra spicy vindaloo as a standing order, recently I could eat it all without any issues. That's not what I'm looking for. Not too authentic according to an Indian colleague."

47,Memories of India, 1 star ,2 years ago,"So, I ordered biryani they gave rice mixed with Paneer mutter gravy them mixed both to make it look like biryani. If they didn’t have a biryani they could’ve just denied me and then I would have ordered something else if I wanted to have a Paneer gravy with rice I would’ve ordered same. 16euros not worth it"
48,Memories of India, 5 stars ,6 years ago,My husband and I stumbled upon this place and it turned out to be one of the most memorable parts of our trip.

Outside appearance is normal but after entering inside we got saw impressive decor.  After having dinner we came to the conclusion that this was our best meal in an Indian restaurant so far. Service was very friendly and the food was superb.
63,Memories of India, 1 star ,5 years ago,Well the green chicken curry is too sour. Also the absence of vegetables in the curry indicates little effort is placed on good ingredients. Sauce is also not thick enogh. Also a quality indicator. With so many cheaper and better options around better save the ~15 Euros for a curry and find another good restaurant in town.
64,Memories of India, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"wow, i did not expect that. i just had the most tender lamb i've ever had. the flavour was great, the spice level spot on and even the bare rice was tasty. what id like to highlight is that the interior is not this over-the-top indian bollywood style. i prefer it like this a lot more. i so will come again!!"

78,Memories of India, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Really bad service, having to wait long. Biased staff that spoke badly of the dining guests in their local language.
I had a clear view of the kitchen from where I was sitting and the kitchen hygiene is bad. The chefs did not follow hygiene standards."
79,Memories of India, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Did not like the service here. The food was not great either. They have a feeling that they serve great Indian food but the truth is that just making food spicy with 10 levels of hotness does not make it good Indian food.
80,Memories of India, 1 star ,2 years ago,We were there at 10pm and it was relatively empty. Came in with 2 Dutch and an Indian family. They seated the Dutch couple and Indian family.

85,Memories of India, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"If you know Indian food, don't eat here. Reheated food That tastes like spiced butter and bad service. When you tell them the foods not heated properly they deny it and accuse you of not knowing what ""hot food"" tastes like."
