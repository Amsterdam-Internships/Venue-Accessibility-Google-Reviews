2,L'Invite, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Went here for dinner and it cost €330.
Unfortunately I found the food to be quite bland except for that which wasn’t cooked and served fresh, like oysters. There was one waiter and a young girl in …"
3,L'Invite, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Gorgeous location,  especially if the weather permits you to sit outside by the canal. Well thought-out tasting menu with lots of interesting tastes and largely local products. Excellent accompanying wines."
4,L'Invite, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely venue, great service. Smallish portions if you’re hungry, but take your time and savour them — wonderful flavors and taste. Worth going for sure. Only place I’ve eaten game meat that hasn’t actually tasted super-strong and gamey, just enough for taste but not overwhelming."

7,L'Invite, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Overpriced dining with an overpromising (fine dining) website. Static menu, mise en place (cooking). 2/10 value for money. Oysters were good."
8,L'Invite, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely tasting menu dinner had here. We opted for the flight of Dutch wines to accompany the food. Yes, it’s expensive, but what fine dining with quite a lot of lovely wines isn’t? We had an extra glass of fizz to start, and a cheese course …"
9,L'Invite, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"It's not worth.

The place is cozy and the service is excellent. The Dutch wines are unbelievable …"
10,L'Invite, 5 stars ,2 years ago,In October we enjoyed a 3-week visit to Italy and Rhine cruise that concluded with 3 days in Amsterdam. Our accommodations on Bloemgracht were near l'Invite where we discovered the charm of an afternoon glass of wine on the waterside …
11,L'Invite, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Good but price quality ratio not so good.

12,L'Invite, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Good restaurant with a nice mix of traditional and modern. The food was tasty.
Service was not really to my taste, it's not unfriendly, but I didn't really care for the 'humor'."
13,L'Invite, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This meal was fantastic and so worth the investment. Service was great, the decor was relaxed but still felt special, and the experience flew by, we wanted to stay the whole night. Can't wait to go back!"
14,L'Invite, 1 star ,5 years ago,I really don't know how this got good reviews across all review sites because it's the worst fine dining experience I've ever had. …
15,L'Invite, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"5 stars for location and service and the bread...however the experience was let down by 2 out of 5 of the dishes. The third dish was some strange cold root vegetable melange - basically 2 different kinds carrots, and various potatoes. The …"
16,L'Invite, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Elegant, expensive, WORTH EVERY EURO. Just a fantastic dining experience. Right up there will Eleven Madison Park. The owner is the waiter, server, cleaner, host, etc. But he does it with such ease and grace and beautiful service! Don't …"

24,L'Invite, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food, great view!"
25,L'Invite, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Apparently kids aren't welcome. They expect kids can't eat an 7 course meal. And suggest you find some Italian food down the street. I suggest you take the kids to Envy or Janusz instead!
26,L'Invite, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The ambience was great but my main course was served lukewarm. Service also a little slow. This restaurant is 70% to where it needs to be.
