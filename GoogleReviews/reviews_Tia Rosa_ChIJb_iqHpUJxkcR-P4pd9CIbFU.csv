The tapas are  home made. We had a great evening with our American cruise friends. Thank you Tia Rosa. We'll be back soon. üíã‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,Tia Rosa, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Very nice staff. Probably the best service I have ever gotten in the Netherlands. Shoutout naar Alfred, de waitress en de chef üëå"
2,Tia Rosa, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"We ate delicious tapas at Tia Rosa in Amsterdam. They also have special Spanish wines and beers.
For dessert we had a cocktail. I will come here more often & nice terrace at the canal!"
3,Tia Rosa, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"The place is very nice and the food is good, but at 11 the owner and staff tried to push the remaining
people out by opening the door and start closing the restaurant, he remove an umbrella from outside and stored it next to me before I could order dessert"
4,Tia Rosa, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Im doing this review before I even tasted the food. Been waiting 55minuts for my food, while my friends recieved three dishes each. One star for cosy atmosphere. But honestly, dont treat guests like this."

9,Tia Rosa, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"The taste of the food was good, but... The portion size compared to price is ridiculous. I mean fine-dining-tasting-menu-size ridiculous.

Price 3 stars
Costumer service 4 stars ‚Ä¶"
12,Tia Rosa, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"I give three stars because the little burgers are aaammmaazing. Other than that, the rest of the tapas are underwhelming, and over priced. Same goes for the sangria."
13,Tia Rosa, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good food and nice service you can at this place. The sangria is surprisingly good. Not a lot off space outside but inside is cosy.
14,Tia Rosa, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I tasted a really nice cocktail and some delicious croquettes! Nice place to visit, I preferred the outside tables on the Canal."
15,Tia Rosa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great tapas, cosy inside, nice house wine.  Ate almost everything on the menu over the span of a few days, everything was fresh, well prepared and delicious.  Definitely recommend."
16,Tia Rosa, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing! Food is absolutely delicious and restaurant itself is beautiful. Highly recommend!
17,Tia Rosa, 2 stars ,a month ago,Service is a total disgrace. Staff is rude and super slow. I wouldn't recommend this place at all.
18,Tia Rosa, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious patatas tia rosa y really nice calamares! The tortilla de patatas was not that great. The place is nice and has friendly stuff working here
19,Tia Rosa, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place had friendly staff working there, which were mainly dutch. The decor in the restaurant was nice and it had a lively atmosphere. However, did not remind me of tapas and for the price I could get a better deal at a hotel restaurant. Overall, 3 stars from me, its worth a try."
20,Tia Rosa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food coma! This place is great. Prime location and great food. Not expensive. Great atmosphere. The service was super friendly and fun. They have good wine a and a good variety of tapas. We will definitely come here again. Highly recommended tapas restaurant.
21,Tia Rosa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Spanish chefs, means real Spanish taste! Been there a few times, never disappointed. The service is fast and friendly, all what we like when going to a restaurant! The place is frequented by local people too, that is good sign :)"
22,Tia Rosa, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Not impressed. Food was so-so for the price. Service just ok. Sangria was real average. But what really upset us was the most was fact that the restaurant doesn‚Äôt serve tap water. We asked why they don‚Äôt serve tap water and apparently the ‚Ä¶

24,Tia Rosa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Loved the tapas menu at Tapas Tia Rosa. They are one of the oldest restaurants around. The ambiance is perfect for casual dining or if you want to catch up with friends over drinks. Their service is quite good and they don't trouble you ‚Ä¶
25,Tia Rosa, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Agree with some points from the reviewers here. Sadly the tapas is really a Dutch interpretation rather then authentic. Lot of mayo on a lot of dishes which basically kill the food's taste. Also no tap water and no free bread (shouldn't ‚Ä¶
26,Tia Rosa, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice environment, and nice staff. However, they sell something as being tipically Spanish, but that needs a bit of an improvement. I never saw cheese on the side of a Spanish tortilla, only here. Much too small portions, and quite expensive as well. However, the cooking is good."
27,Tia Rosa, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Just off the super touristy part of the center of Amsterdam, you can find this great place with a warm atmosphere. Service is nice and efficient and the food is clearly above par, certainly considering the friendly price level. Now, you ‚Ä¶"
