18,Saigon Caphe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The service is prompt and good. They have a good selection of Vietnamese dishes. I tried the spicy beef and pork noodle soup. The taste is westernized and not to spicy but still a good choice in Amsterdam.
19,Saigon Caphe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Decent food with great service. When there with my colleagues and had their lunch set menu which is highly recommended.

45,Saigon Caphe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great variety of vietnamese dishes here and pretty fast service.  The noodle bowls are very big so come hungry.  Management is chinese,  but still very good vietnamese taste.  Try the Bun BO.  There is a parking lot just in front so very convenient to visit."
46,Saigon Caphe, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We asked for a crab and pork soup, the soup came without crab and no explanation until we asked.

48,Saigon Caphe, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"ordered / picked up the Pho and soup with tripe a few times, great addition to the selection of asian food in Buietvelderd / Amstelveen. Also the salad rolls are fresh and crunchy. No complaints what soever, but i didn't sit down here yet."
49,Saigon Caphe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This place gets very busy for both lunch amd dinner, so drop in off peak or make a reservation. Food comes out quickly (starters only took 5 mins), and the overall flavor was good. A solid option if you're visiting the Gelderlandplein."
50,Saigon Caphe, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Used to be the 'five star' pho house, but then after seeing a hair in the soup...It's now the 'three star'. Overall taste is awesome though."

53,Saigon Caphe, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Wow the fastest and fullest food experience of 2021 for me
54,Saigon Caphe, 1 star ,2 years ago,The food does not have a normal flavor. I think it's because of the spices that are in it. Even a simple chicken takes a sweet to cook. I'm sorry for my choice.
55,Saigon Caphe, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Second time here, first time was not super, but wanted to give it another try. Tasteless pho, broth was like water. Service was so so, they don't seem to understand how to keep clients happy. Wil never visit this place again."
56,Saigon Caphe, 4 stars ,a day ago,"It grew a lot over the years, not anymore only a limited menu but quite an extensive menu with good quality food. Always busy inside and outside. Great location, easy to park underground."
57,Saigon Caphe, 4 stars ,a month ago,Delicious caramel duck breast with rice and season vegetables ..... yummie
58,Saigon Caphe, 1 star ,2 years ago,A male staff is really disrespectful. Something went wrong with my card and another female staff who was really kind to help me. But he just stood there impatiently and asked me whether I calmed down. So rude. One star for the nice female staff. Not recommend here
59,Saigon Caphe, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Pho had no vegetables or flavor, meat was highly processed and tasteless, and on top of it all they got our order wrong. Delivery took almost 2 hours."

61,Saigon Caphe, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicious food, friendly staff"
62,Saigon Caphe, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Surprisingly good Vietnamese food in a train station. Super friendly service. A most welcomed stop arriving in Amsterdam and a most needed stop leaving Amsterdam.
63,Saigon Caphe, 1 star ,2 years ago,I wish I could give them ‚Äòzero‚Äô. They have a waiter who does not know differences between being friendly and rude. He asked me a very private thing in front of his fellow workers. It was very very disrespectful.
64,Saigon Caphe, 1 star ,5 years ago,Poor service! I came in at 4pm to dine in and take away but I was told one of their staffs and chef that kitchen is closed because staff are all having a break üò≥ they asked me to wait 15-30 mins. ‚Ä¶
