5,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,The starter not so tasty. Nice atmosphere and Kind people but they charged us more without explaining. There was also one more couple that had the same issue. Be careful!:)

42,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a find! It was a privilege to be allowed to eat in such historical surroundings - 5 old 17th Century houses put together to form what is really the most quirky and extraordinary restaurant. We were in a room where we sat next to 4 …

45,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely fabulous experience all round. It's like going back in time to the splendour of the captains quarters on a long ship. The food was beautifully presented and tickled the taste buds from start to splendid finish. The sparkling tea …

47,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the gems in Amsterdam. Sure, one might say not much locals eat here, but do they eat in other high class restaurants regularly? This place is a gem in the center. It has history, it has art (Rembrandts on the walls..) it has the …"

Thank you for a great evening and meal Giulia, your gift is hanging on our fridge :) /The couple from Sweden."
49,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The venue is stunning. A number of old houses that are connected together to form different rooms where you can sit with relatively few other guests. The waiters/waitresses have to run up & down very steep staircases (a feature of old …
50,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I must say the oysters was delicious with the bacon bits and jalapeños. Very very mouth watering delicious. The wait was about 30 minutes which wasn't bad. My wife had the crab cakes. My daughter also tagged alone she had the buffalo wings …

54,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was good as well as the service.  The reason for the 3 stars is that as we were having dinner, we thought the wine poured was very small and when a young lady sat near us and got her wine, it was substantially more.  (The waiter …"
55,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Absolutely beautiful and classy restaurant.  You must visit when in Amsterdam.
56,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service (5 stars to the waitress!) and locals, and decent portions. The food (5 course menu with wine) was great, but not quite matching the prices. Would give 4.5 stars if I could."

61,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty good, wouldn't say amazing. Had to wait for wine, and didn't get the wine order right. Food was above average and waiting staff where friendly. Desert wasn't great and lacked options. Great novelty factor based on venue and the Rembrandt paintings on the wall so for that reason it's worth trying out once at least."
62,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Set menu. Quality ingredients, poorly executed. Low on flavour. Good service and interesting environment."
63,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Had the 5 course tasting menu. The wines were actually really nice, but the food was really nothing special at all - just OK. Would've been three stars if it weren't 80€. Beautiful old building though.
Almost only tourists."
64,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good and interesting restaurant! Since It is one of the oldest restaurants in the city, the construction has slightly slanted, which gives the place a unique touch..the architecture is spectacular and you can find some of Rembrandt's work hanging on the walls."
65,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had the five course meal with wine pairing.  It was exceptional.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  Make your reservation early if you want to eat at 7:30 - 8:30 pm.
66,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food with great presentation, with very beautiful dutch decorations. Not pricey (around 50pp) considering the location. Get a side dish with your main course if you are hungry - they are quite large and tasty"

Service was professional.
Was not let down from my expectations of a fine dinning experience. …"

70,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I would love to give this restaurant a five star review, but unfortunately my experience with service was subpar. I was dining there with my wife while in Amsterdam and we felt that we did not get much attention: long delays in receiving …"
71,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We found this restaurant by accident. It was in the “alley” next door to our hotel and not particularly inviting, but the menu was intriguing so we made a reservation. Wow! What a delicious dinner of sea bream I had and made gluten-free for …"
72,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing historical setting. Celeriac soup warms nicely after a day battling the biting cold winds that cut the streets and alleyways of Amsterdam.  Not a lot of variety, but a nice wine selection.  Choice dishes cooked to perfection."
73,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food and service were fantastic even with our large group which included 6 kids! It was really fun to dine in such a historical location. We signed the guest book, which the server said goes back hundreds of years."
74,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Traditional restaurant with interesting local design. However, truly overpriced for the low quality of food and service. The fish of the day came cold and tasteless, mains were served 45 minutes after the starters with rude behaviour from …"
75,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It was one of the best restaurant I have ever been to. The service was very good, the place was very beautiful. The 5 menu with the 5 drinks were delicious. It did make a hole in my girlfriends pocket, but she says it was really worth it."
76,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"As local expats and regular restaurant visitors over 10 years we Have visited most top restaurants within Amsterdam and the surrounding area. The ambience in the building is nice, it’s old and is historic. The wine menu is mainly red wines, …"
77,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very bad value for money, feels like a tourist trap. The only positive point about this restaurant is the setting: a beautiful building with a lot of original and classic touches and a very cosy atmosphere. The tasting menu wasn't anything …"
78,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great ambience and food.  Situated in a very old wood panelled building, this place has lots of character.  Staff very friendly, and while the service is somewhat leisurely, this is a place to settle in for the night and enjoy the food and good wine at length.  Very much enjoyed our visit."
79,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful experience. Great staff in a very historic restaurant. Great atmosphere. Small menu but good menu even a vegetarian choice. Cocktails and drinks also good quality
80,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Unique interior design looks like something out of a movie set in the 1600s, while the food in contrast is very modern and fusion. The atmosphere is a bit ruined by the mixing of boisterous large group 12 person tables amidst 2-4 person …"
81,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I can't say a single bad thing about that experience.  Fantastic.  Delicious.  Attentive.  Happy.
82,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We ended up here by complete accident. We realize almost immediately that this place was way too fancy for a couple of morons like us, but because we're Canadian, we were too polite to turn around and leave. So we ended up sitting through a …"

85,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Building is awesome. Our group ordered beef, but stuff said we ordered chicken. Even though we want to make up money to change beef, it’s not allow. And we want to pay to extra one beef, only one beef is also not allow. Very disappointed."
86,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent place to visit if you like old-stilysh restaurants. Beautiful interior. Good and fast service. Very tasty food.

87,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Ambiance: Quaint, like granny's house from the dutch countryside.
Bites: Hearty, wholesome, very filling and reasonably priced! Try the dutch meatball/s the size of your fist. …"
88,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food is actually good but service generally is quite poor and therefore the value equation is very wrong. For example: they say they have 10+ wines by the glass but they don't have a list and their staff (who are constantly rushing around …
89,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the most awful dining experiences I've had in ages!  From the second we sat down and were ""greeted"" by our drill sergeant of a waitress, Francesca, who never smiled and spoke with a tone as if she was directing a factory full of …"

94,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"20% service charge, plus VAT - now was it worth it? Did the 5 courses, with 5 wines - as the evening went on the delay between courses and drinks got big and big. Serious time wasted waiting for luke warm food. Fantastic setting, just have feeling over being over charged."
95,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really a treasure of Amsterdam history, the founder was a Dutchman - great friend of Danny Kaye and many celebs right up to Bruce Springsteen and Mick Jagger.

97,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best restaurants in town. Everything here is superb: the very friendly staff, the 17th century building, the great food, and the atmosphere. A prefect place for a celebration or a special occasion. Besides these, the food is just perfect."
98,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"OK, but for this price I expected much better food.

The service was excellent, but food was bland and lacking sophistication. I …"
99,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Two stars for the old buildings and the location. Food was appalling! Ok we were a big group, but nothing could excuse the very fat overcooked chicken, peas that might have come out of a can (!), or the sweet that could have been thrown against the wall and still land on the floor intact. Decent service."
100,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Service is good. Food is also good but I found other better place and food for lower price.

103,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice place to have a nice dinner. The restaurant is old and the inside is amazing. The decoration is fantastic and the whole restaurant is 5 buildings connected from the inside. Very good recommendation!

105,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Historical venue - old school Dutch design. The  food was great although not particularly memorable. Definitely come for the ambiance if you want a little Dutch history.

107,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and wine, but absolutely overpriced. Essentially you're paying for the experience of being near some original Rembrandts. The service also slowed considerably once it started filling up. Wouldn't go again."
108,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 5 stars ,8 years ago,An amazing culinary treat in a city that serves so many average dishes. Old world charm and delicious dishes with slightly slow service.  I would come again without question. Bravo!

111,d'Vijff Vlieghen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This restaurant is a nice, antique restaurant. Its foods include various categories of nutrition, and fills you up. If weren't for the slow service and bad condition of the washrooms, this restaurant would be a top pick."
