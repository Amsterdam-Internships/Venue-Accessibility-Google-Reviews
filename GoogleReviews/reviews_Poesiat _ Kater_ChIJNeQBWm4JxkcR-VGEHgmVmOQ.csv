0,Poesiat & Kater, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Had some excellent beers, perfect ambience in nice autumn weather on the terrace. Ordering with QR code works great.just a shame you need to have a pay app or remember to have your random reader with you. Paying with Pin or cash would be nice to have as a option"
1,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,a month ago,"This place has the best fries in Amsterdam - crispy yet light and fluffy, with skins on. The beer is also great and the rest of the menu is worth a taste but do not skip out on the fries."
2,Poesiat & Kater, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Great and authentic brewery with friendly and supportive staff, tasty drinks and delicious pub food. I had some Princesse beer which are brewed after the recipe from van de Van Vollenhoven which was around 1900 the biggest brewery from ‚Ä¶"

4,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Food was outstanding. After a super long travel day, great meal."
5,Poesiat & Kater, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The beer is among the best I‚Äôve sampled in Amsterdam with a diverse flavour profile. They nail it. The service however is brutal. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a Dutch thing but the service here is comparable with other restaurants in the tourist ‚Ä¶
6,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,a year ago,"That was the very craft beer place I was looking for!
Everything is perfect, beers, choice, staff, snacks! The brewery itself and even the home animals gravestones! ‚Ä¶"
7,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a place. The best beer I had in Amsterdam. A Vollenhoven & Co - Princesse Bier. The service = top class. Explained the different beers for us and made some recommendations what we might like or not out of our preferences. When we go back to Amsterdam this is the first place on our list. Recommend this as much as I can.
8,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Hidden gem in Oostpoort, great beers and fantastic burgers! They also have sweet potatoes ‚ù§Ô∏è There is a nice terrace to sit outside but also a very cozy place inside"
9,Poesiat & Kater, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice brewery with good beers. Around me I see a lot of people with sharing plates that look delicious. I just went here for a beer, the Indies pale ale, but who knows, maybe I'll give this place 5 stars next time I'm here and the food is good. It smells good and the people look happy, that's for sure."
10,Poesiat & Kater, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Interesting place - tucked away from noise and bustle. You can order beers using a QR code....seemingly doesn't work for ordering the stout. Failed 3 times. Staff didn't seem particularly interested.
11,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing beer taster based on our preferences, recommended by the bar lady, along with fantastic food and beautiful decor. Worth a visit."

15,Poesiat & Kater, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Location is great! Next to the canal.. space is large to accommodate all sized groups. Beer was good but food was ok, nothing special"
16,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great beer and good Asian inspired food. Well worth the trek from the city center.
17,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Awesome location, very very tasty beer (gotta love the herbst bok and the princess), will def come again!"
18,Poesiat & Kater, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I really want to like this place, and liked it before. But the service is really terrible: long waits, confused staff, staff hanging around, not getting a card when sitting down, etc. Often they run out of dishes or beers: last time no fish ‚Ä¶"
19,Poesiat & Kater, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice and chill brewery/bar, semi-hidden in Oost. Very nice terrace and good personell."
20,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This spacious brewpub in Oost has deep roots in Amsterdam's historical beer culture, actually brews its own beer on premises, and has a pretty mean menu to boot. They're also pretty active in the beer culture scene, so there's always some ‚Ä¶"
21,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great wide selection of beers, lovely atmosphere and very friendly staff."

36,Poesiat & Kater, 2 stars ,a year ago,"The beer worth the visit, they have a few on tap. But the food is disappointing, we got burger and nachos. The burger was raw, no kidding, we could feel the texture and temperature; and the nachos supposed to have melted cheese, but it was ‚Ä¶"
37,Poesiat & Kater, 3 stars ,4 years ago,A new brewery that is also a small resto. It has a large nice cosy front terrace with big red parasols with views on a train track & a stream.
38,Poesiat & Kater, 4 stars ,9 months ago,The beer was excellent and service was friendly and helpful. The only thing lacking was that the chips were very salty and felt like a ploy to drink more.
39,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great beer! A damn good stout, recognized by critics. Pretty good pricing for the beer. ‚Ä¶"
40,Poesiat & Kater, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Service was slow and dinner orders fell through the cracks but beer and food are great.
41,Poesiat & Kater, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Staff was very Friendly and the only vegetarian dish you could choose was delicious. It did take a rather long time for our food to arrive because they had a group. Luckily there were games. The beer is amazing!

43,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The cool and laid back atmosphere was a nice welcome! Then we took a look at the tasty menu and our mood improved a lot!! And the beers (self made) are a wonderful pairing with the food. Finally, extra points for the music selection."
44,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Tasty homebrews and good atmosphere. Both indoor and outdoor seating (full sun until around 16:00 - a few spots even later. A few board games available. Sometimes football on TV on the weekend. Also hosts big groups and has the possibility to get an own tap on that case (what we've done once). A place I regularly visit with friends.

46,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely, friendly local microbrewery in the east side of Amsterdam. 5 minute walk from the main ‚Äòshopping‚Äô area. Knowledgable staff. I didn‚Äôt have food, but it looked good & for a Wednesday evening at 6pm it was pretty busy. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs great in summer with their large terrace."
47,Poesiat & Kater, 1 star ,a year ago,We left after 10min as we booked a table without knowing that the kitchen was closed and the service was really unfriendly. We‚Äôll probably come back for a beer and the atmosphere as the bar is well located but not for the service for sure
48,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Cool space, good beers, good food."
49,Poesiat & Kater, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great new beer spot but needs some tweaks.

51,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Nice burger + vegan options. Great atmosphere!
52,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is the reliable local Amsterdam craft brewery you're looking for. With a solid stout, IPA, and wheat beer plus something limited and good, you're guaranteed to scratch your itch for quality beer. Location is nice too, good atmosphere."

54,Poesiat & Kater, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent brew bar! Warm and cozy atmosphere. Quite good food that pair well with their beer. Falcon Ale and Extra Stout are my favorites!
55,Poesiat & Kater, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Steak was really very tasty, but on the small side. Chicken and fries were good but not outstanding, side salads were a bit boring. Beers were very good and the reason I come back here."
56,Poesiat & Kater, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We come every now and then for beers, cause they're really good. But our first experience with dinner may be the last: with a group of four, we were served two at a time, with like 30 minutes in between. Lovely way to have a family dinner, ‚Ä¶"
57,Poesiat & Kater, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A lovely place with a spacious outside and inside seating area. Lunch menu is simple but tasty, and the wide range of locally brewed beers is delicious!"
58,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty new brewery. The beers they serve are not all that far outside of what most microbreweries serve, but I like the concentration on reviving beers brewed by historic Amsterdam breweries that don't exist anymore. The interior is clean ‚Ä¶"
59,Poesiat & Kater, 5 stars ,a year ago,Beautiful brewpub with great outdoor seating and gastronomic selection. The beers are very much focused on appealing to a wide audience.

67,Poesiat & Kater, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I had a Princesse beer which was very refreshing. It was made with 2 yeasts - a Bavarian and a saison which made it very fresh with lively carbonation (lots of bubbles). Food was excellent.  I had Bavette which was beef and mushrooms on a brown baguette. For dessert i had the brownies with mixed fruit and cream. Would come again.
