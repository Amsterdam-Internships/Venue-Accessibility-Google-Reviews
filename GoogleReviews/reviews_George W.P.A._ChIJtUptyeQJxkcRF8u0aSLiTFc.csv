0,George W.P.A., 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Very nice restaurant, in a very nice area. We were in the terrace, and tables are small for four people, but is ok. Very good food, everything we had was very good. The problem was the service, very polite and kind people, but we had to ask three or four times for things we had order, like s glass of beer or a glass of wine."
1,George W.P.A., 1 star ,6 months ago,"Went here for the second time hoping that it was better than my first. For 20 euros, an eggs Benedict should be delicious. The giant blob in the top of the photo is entirely hollandaise sauce. It was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen …"
2,George W.P.A., 3 stars ,4 months ago,"This place has a nice vibe, but the food and service not quite as good as the Cafe George in Central. Our food arrived almost cold and dried out, and the service was slow and unnatentive 😕"
3,George W.P.A., 1 star ,4 months ago,"Don't know about other dishes, but the eggplant steak definitely not worth its money. Can't even call it decent, too watery and almost tasteless if not for the sauce on top of it. Dried fries that you couldn't even put your fork through"
4,George W.P.A., 1 star ,3 months ago,Great Terrace and location. Food was mediocre and pricy. Service very bad for a place that expensive. We waited for an hour to get some cold food. Gentlemen I'm sorry but you'll never see me again.
5,George W.P.A., 5 stars ,4 months ago,Much better than the 3.2 rating I see here. I had great good and very friendly service. Outdoor heated seating option with good ventilation is an added positive during COVID.
6,George W.P.A., 3 stars ,6 months ago,"+ Cozy environment.
+ Good location.
+ Tasty food. …"
7,George W.P.A., 1 star ,6 months ago,"Very bad experience! Bad oesters, also the rest of the food was nothing special and on top of it super slow service. The place used to be really fun, hip, clean & tidy. Now it seems to be rundown, unqualified and not enough employees. I do get it, Covid - shortage on staff. If that’s the case, lower the amount on tables."
8,George W.P.A., 2 stars ,2 years ago,Nice French fries. Horrible malinase. Pasta was nice and spicy. Roasted vegetables was just strange. Burrata was nothing special. The baguette was very fresh and nice. Service was not welcoming at all very slow service table very small and …
9,George W.P.A., 5 stars ,11 months ago,"We went for the moules, penne arrabbiata and escalope milanaise and it was so good!
So nice to have dinner in the terrace in Summer.
Highly recommended in Amsterdam!"
10,George W.P.A., 2 stars ,5 months ago,Expensive and very slow service for a very average food. I guess only worth (?) for the show off of being seated in its nice location.
11,George W.P.A., 4 stars ,5 months ago,A little bit overpriced and we did not get fresh salad on the plate. But the food in generall was good also the service and the location.
12,George W.P.A., 1 star ,4 months ago,The food took more than 1h30 to be ready. The workers forgot about us and we lost more than 2 hours just to eat 2 plates that was not good and also expensive
13,George W.P.A., 1 star ,7 months ago,"Very bad quality and service for the price.
This place is overpriced, the food is okayish but the service is a disaster. I cannot blame the waiters as they are doing their best, but obviously they are …"
14,George W.P.A., 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place with friendly waiters and good food. The artichoke was very nice choice for a starter. We did however had the surprise that our bill was bumped with main courses we never had and also additional bottles of water. However we were …
15,George W.P.A., 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Just had my mom's birthday there and I have to say, not only was the food absolutely delicious, the staff was lovely and even accommodated my dogs! Top!"
16,George W.P.A., 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Place is charming, but service is a but chaotic and food not so special. Great for the place and view, though - and a cup of coffee"
17,George W.P.A., 5 stars ,8 months ago,"GEORGE is one of my favorite restaurants in Amsterdam when it comes to good food  / fine-dine.
Their Salmon Miso is so far the most delicious one compared to the ones I had in other restaurants. In my opinion, the food is good value for the money."
18,George W.P.A., 1 star ,6 months ago,Stood at the entrance for proper 5-10 mins no one cares that we are waited to be seated. Kept pointing at different persons to talk to. One of the worst service in Holland.
19,George W.P.A., 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Service is really poor in comparison to the prices they ask. Moreover, the staff is not very helpful or motivated."
20,George W.P.A., 1 star ,4 months ago,"Nice location but slow and poor service.
Fillet steak was very bland."
21,George W.P.A., 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice location, but waiters and kitchen are extremely slow! I had to wait for 50min for below average eggs Benedict and I got them only after the 4th time I asked."
22,George W.P.A., 1 star ,8 months ago,"Waited 1.5 hours for food to arrive while it was quiet. Waiters are young students and paid very limited attention to the guests, not recommended"
23,George W.P.A., 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is ok, let's say that the place itself is better than the food experience. That corner, that terrace, the sun (if you are lucky)....Service is really good, many people ready to serve you. Best place after your visit to Vondelpark."
24,George W.P.A., 4 stars ,a year ago,"Good food,  great location and atmosphere, especially on long warm Dutch summer evenings. Staff is not too attending, but still polite. I am not a big fan of how they expand out to the sidewalk, forcing walking by public out to the street."
25,George W.P.A., 5 stars ,a year ago,"Friendly, attentive staff. Sat outside under heaters, as a little chilly. My daughter and I had a few bar snacks which were delicious. Definitely worth visiting as off the main streets. Situated on a corner watching the world go by. Worth visiting if in the museum area. Book first."
26,George W.P.A., 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is very good I must admit it and the place is very nice and comfortable. However, the food took an hour and a half to be delivered to the table. Let me repeat that just to be clear. It took 90 minutes to get food to the table from …"
27,George W.P.A., 1 star ,a year ago,"We ordered a dinner for four incl. a whole plate of sushi. It came with 4 hair in the first 2 sashimi. When calling them to complain, they promised to return the call, but never did. When I followed up, they told me the manager is too busy and in a meeting and that I should send him an email. Extremely disgusting and poor experience"
28,George W.P.A., 1 star ,a year ago,"My pasta (carbonara) was horrible, basically just eating a plate of parsley. Also got served cold. My boyfriend’s Steak was good and the fries were crispy. He enjoyed his meal. …"
29,George W.P.A., 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of my favourite places in Amsterdam. Nice location and friendly staff. The food is always good and freshly prepared
30,George W.P.A., 1 star ,a year ago,"The most unpleasant experience I have had in a restaurant, and this is coming from someone who has experienced restaurants in many parts of the world. Service was very rude and unpleasant, we were waiting outside (after nearly being hit by …"
31,George W.P.A., 1 star ,a year ago,0 Stars! The most terrible customer service experience we've ever had (considering I have been living in 4 different countries and travelled a lot). I am writing this while leaving this low-level place and after reading similar reviews this …
32,George W.P.A., 1 star ,2 years ago,"This is definitely the last time I went here. After waiting 30 minutes for our food, a waitress showed up with the steak tartare, asking how we wanted it served and telling us she would prepare it now. Then waited another 25 minutes, food …"
33,George W.P.A., 1 star ,a year ago,"I live in the area, I've taken friends here and been embarrassed by the service on two occasions now. Seated for half an hour with no service and eventually had to ask bar staff to pay for the water that we ordered.
Expats not welcome apparently!"
34,George W.P.A., 1 star ,2 years ago,"First of all: we never experienced a service as bad as in George WPA. We live in Amsterdam and travel a lot - so we have been to many various places, this - bar far - has been the worst one. We had to wait 50 minutes for only two glasses of …"
35,George W.P.A., 4 stars ,8 years ago,"We were in a group of 9 people, and had a very enjoyable evening at Restaurant George on Monday 22nd April.
The atmosphere, despite being a Monday night was buzzing and the restaurant was …"
36,George W.P.A., 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great food. Service was...less good. But still okat for Amsterdam standards.
37,George W.P.A., 1 star ,a year ago,"Not the first time that I see the waiters here turning away people of colour when asking for a seat. I did not get a good sight of the waiter doing so unfortunately, otherwise I could have confronted him. Two ladies with Indian features …"
38,George W.P.A., 5 stars ,2 years ago,"PERFECT!
We know the old manager of Le Garage, how happy we are to find him again after 12 months. This restaurant needed someone like him. Food was great! And we will come again very soon. Certainly 5 Stars!"
39,George W.P.A., 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Unfortunately George WPA did not live up to expectations. We had made a reservation for 8 and visited last Sunday. First, despite being a nice fellow, the waiter initially did not want to seat us at the terrace as he would've had to move …"
40,George W.P.A., 1 star ,3 years ago,This is actually zero star restaurant. Came from US for a week already. All restaurants were good until this one. I can’t wait to leave the restaurant before I write this review. The Fishsoup we ordered was beyond expensive. A very small …
41,George W.P.A., 1 star ,4 years ago,"Appalling service at this restaurant. We had ordered 3 main dishes in which come with a side of chips and salad. They had put the chips and salad for 3 people in one small bowl expecting everyone to eat their mains with that, I quote …"
42,George W.P.A., 3 stars ,7 months ago,"The cocktails are nice, food not so much. T"
43,George W.P.A., 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Some of the waitstaff was very rude, others very nice. Our group had four people order fries and they were brought in two small bowls; when we asked about this, we were told ""you got what you ordered, that's four orders, you have to share"" before the waitress left. Ok... 😯 My food was OK, but nothing special."
44,George W.P.A., 1 star ,2 years ago,"Came here 13:30pm, now it’s 15:30 and still waiting for the main dish... nice place to hang out if you come for wine and bread only. The manager doesn’t seem to be bothered with the ratings anyway. Go there if you wanna kill time but don’t end up killing yourself 😁 perfect for loooooong first dates"
45,George W.P.A., 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Mixed quality of the food. Good oysters and moules frites. Spaghetti carbonara completely overcooked, taste was ok. Very bad service. Not interested at all in serving guests well. We waited more than hour for our food. Only excuses, why it was like that."
46,George W.P.A., 2 stars ,5 years ago,"On a hot day when it gets crowded on the terrace, the service is slow and the quality of the food is neglected. We had to wait long for drinks + sparkling water. When the main course arrived - the meat was overcooked (we asked for …"
47,George W.P.A., 3 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place to get a drink, but it is very expensive. Location is nothing special, next to a busy road. It took a long time before we could order due to the staff being very busy."
48,George W.P.A., 1 star ,a year ago,"There was not much guidance around how to get a table, or track and trace. The staff was not very explanatory about the matter whilst ordering drinks, he did say another person wpuld take our food order. After 20 mins waiting we decided to leave."
49,George W.P.A., 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Good service, ok tastes."
50,George W.P.A., 3 stars ,a year ago,"Had the eggs norwegian and a douple espresso - the food was great, the coffee was way overpriced. Took a while to get the menus and to order."
51,George W.P.A., 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best eggs Benedict in town. Can be very busy but defiantly worth a visit for a good lunch. Skip the wine per glass (why on earth is a glass this expensive!?) And go for a bottle. Enjoy the sun outside and eat the best Benedict one can find in Amsterdam.
52,George W.P.A., 4 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best outdoor terrace seatings in Amsterdam.

A good menu with consistently good food - plain but good - from fish and meats …"
53,George W.P.A., 1 star ,7 months ago,Very bad service. The food is not delicious either. I wouldn’t recommend this place.
54,George W.P.A., 1 star ,4 years ago,"Its not a place to eat at...Lack lustre service; chicken Caesar salad consisted of 2 or 3 thumb sized knobs of chicken, half a boiled egg; a huge bowl of lettuce and a grating of parmesan. 14€.  They do not love food here, that is a lesson in maximum GP."
55,George W.P.A., 1 star ,5 years ago,"Friendly waiters/waitresses, menu undetailed and didn't explain what came with each meal, we were given soggy wet menus also. Cod and chips came in a sauce that tasted like cheese, when asked if it was ok to change meal for something …"
56,George W.P.A., 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Not a huge fan, service was ok. The food was expensive for meh.  But, the wait staff were more interested in doing their jobs (like sorting silverware loudly into metal cups right behind me) than waiting on the tables.  And, not the firsr or last, ""bar"" in Amsterdam that won't make coctails/moxed drinks."
57,George W.P.A., 1 star ,4 years ago,"Bad service ever! We just been to café George wpa. First our carpacio was still frozen, after My boyfriends steak was to raw. We sent it back to cook more but it took like 10 min. You pay Almost 28 euro for a maincourse, but the waitress …"
58,George W.P.A., 1 star ,3 years ago,"Terrible place to eat. My son ordered grilled chicken, to come with chips and salad, when it came, it was just chicken thigh in gravy on just a plate, had to ask numerous Times  for the chips and salad, which why would you eat salad with …"
59,George W.P.A., 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff, good food which we got 40 mins after ordering. Portions are on the small side. Restaurant location is great."
60,George W.P.A., 1 star ,a year ago,"Really not good food , expensive for what you get. Especially Risotto with vegetable(s) , comes white boiled rise with green beans and asparagus."

62,George W.P.A., 5 stars ,a year ago,Definitely nice place to dine!
63,George W.P.A., 3 stars ,4 years ago,Solid place to sit outside and people watch. The lunch food was decent but ultimately nothing special. Not worth a wait for a seat but worth a stop.over for a drink or snack.
64,George W.P.A., 1 star ,2 years ago,"You wait a long time to be served, including the drinks.  After a long time (40 min plus) waiting they got my order wrong and we had to wait even longer. I don't recommend."
65,George W.P.A., 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff but yes, other reviewers were right....it is a long wait until being served. Food was good however !"
66,George W.P.A., 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terribly rude service. After being seated, no one came to take our order for 15 minutes and the waiters simply looked away from us when we tried to call their attention"
67,George W.P.A., 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food! Service could be improved. Love the sweet potato fries and the Salmon with Mizo sauce.
68,George W.P.A., 3 stars ,a year ago,"Service used to be better, but the food is still delicious and I love the marble interior too"
69,George W.P.A., 1 star ,8 months ago,Terrible service and average food. Will never come again
70,George W.P.A., 5 stars ,7 years ago,"George has perfected the French bistro style in Amsterdam! This works for any part of the day. I love the menu, the salmon superthin crust pizza is too die for, but so is the artichoke, the mussels, the fries and the mayonaise!! …"

74,George W.P.A., 2 stars ,5 years ago,"It seems to be a nice cafe but the service was really bad. They don't have eye for the guests and after asking twice for Parmesan cheese, it never arrived.
Also the ratio between Price and quality is not good. I will not return and I don't recommend it."
