Pricing is unfair: a scarf was charged as an additional item, so rather than just paying one euro for a jacket, the scarf was also charged one euro while hanging on the same single clothes hanger."
1,OT301, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"A Milestone in your Amsterdam alternative tour, a wide variety of activity to pursue, from workshop to party with diverse programmation. Check their website, the program, and tune in to the webradio weekly show !"
2,OT301, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very interesting to see. I didn't get to party there but i really enjoyed the old school but now a club theme. :D they have different partys old the time u need to check the schedule before.
3,OT301, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really cool place. Fun for night parties, sure, but they also offer lots of different classes and workshops. Including (adults and) kids' sports classes. My children are doing Aerial Yoga (silks & trapeze) with Monika @ youth circus ot301 --> I cannot recommend her highly enough!!"
4,OT301, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It was Dopplereffekt live performance which was amazing! The atmosphere in OT301 club is absolutely underground. This particular party has left a really good impression!

The crew is doing a lot for the neighborhood life."
9,OT301, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great alternative cultural space based in an old film academy on several floors.
