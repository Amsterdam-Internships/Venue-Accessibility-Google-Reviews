0,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,a month ago,Absolutely amazing waffles with endless topping possibilities. Staff was super friendly and helped with suggestions because it's hard to choose when you have so many options. Will definitely be going back on my next visit to Amsterdam!
1,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"We were overwhelmed by the amout of waffle places in amsterdam, but fortunately we choose this one. It is a lovely walk from Central Station. The interior is vibrant and creates a warm atmosphere. The staff was very kind and the waffles tasted amazing. Very good value for your money. I recommend trying."
2,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The waffles are a must here, best we‚Äôve ever had! I recommend choosing your own toppings, the pre-made dishes on the menu looked way too heavy on the sweet side. We decided to get a waffle and crepe both with cheesecake cream, strawberries, ‚Ä¶"
3,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Nice place for a quick bite to eat. Sweet or savoury options on offer. Nice seating area. Corinavirus Cert needed to dine in.
4,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Lovely food . Staff were brilliant. So friendly
5,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Really nice staff. And the waffle was delicious as well.
6,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing crepes & waffles...however my caramel waffle was SO SWEET...my teeth were aching while I was eating it.  Huge variety of waffles & crepes to choose to from.... many vegetarian options.. A bit pricey though.. Restaurant is very clean ‚Ä¶

We visited every night when we stayed in Amsterdam. Just happened across it with ‚Ä¶"

9,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Waffel and crepes are really fresh and tasty. The staff is friendly and a place is nice too. However, we went during rush hour (Saturday, after 4PM) and we had to wait 40min for our order. Also, there is no WC inside."
10,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,a month ago,Good waffles. Very friendly employees. Had options to charge my phone. Neat place and restroom.
11,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Among so many similar shops I picked up this one and was happy to get back there. The staff is helpful and professional, the pricing is clear and trasparent (I was not impressed to visit in Amsterdam some shops that do not display the price clearly!), and of course the quality of the waffles and fruit / ice cream is good."
12,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 1 star ,4 months ago,We tried the Waffles because of the good/positive valuation of google. We don‚Äòt know but we were maybe the unluckiest guest there but the waffles wasn‚Äòt good. ‚ÄûWasn‚Äòt good‚Äú is sadly underrated. ‚Ä¶
13,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Love the warm, freshly made waffle. Toppings were sinful sweet; I had the Cookie Monster. This is not something you should have on a regular basis, but would definitely visit again"

15,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is amazing, there's a nice seating area where you come and enjoy some amazing crepes. I had one if the best iced coffees here, they don't make it in the usual way. Just try the iced coffee."
16,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So delicious! So many flavour options and combos, I was in heaven! Staff very friendly and we were able to sit down inside which was great. Kinder Bueno ice cream was lush and my husband loved the cheesecake cream!"
17,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic cr√™pes shop with table for  2 people and groups,I went there in January with my friend,  we order 2 cr√™pes with honey, coconut, strawberry and ice cream. The place is clean good customer service."
18,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best waffle place I've found in Amsterdam on the two times I've visited. Not ashamed to say I went back for more on my trip.
Great quality, freshly cooked waffles that you can have as a sweet or savoury ‚Ä¶"
19,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly service, and as I heard from the guy in the fast moving line behind me ""a stoners Paradise"".

20,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The overall, the food and the place was great! The place was nice, friendly, fresh kind of vibe and the staff were friendly. They accept credit cards, Visa and Mastercard (I think more too but cant recall). With regard to the food, it feels ‚Ä¶"

24,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The good thing is that you decide how you want the waffles, which are fresh made. They also serve coffee. Nice music and the bathrooms are perfect. Nice place to enjoy in the middle of Amsterdam."
25,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious waffles. Usually space to sit down, but you call also take your food to go, but it's much less messy to sit down. Can get kind of pricy but it is in the heart of the tourist area so that is to be expected."
26,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place , little bit overpriced when including all the waffles elements.
The location is great , in-between the often used small roads. The staff are friendly. Organized in a way, you get a number of your order then it will be ‚Ä¶"
27,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 2 stars ,a week ago,Food was okay but very expensive and we found one of the waiters to be quite unfriendly in the interaction (we asked for some extra info on the menu and we got kind of annoyed reply)
28,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Poorly made stroopwaffel. Go to a traditional bakery instead if you're after one. Other options looker good.

Highly recommend this place!"

54,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,6 months ago,The food is excellent but the music gives me PTSD
55,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I got a crepe and a walfle thinking they weren't going to be that big. One would have been enough. Still ate both.
56,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"‚Ç¨7, made to order waffle, strawberry, blueberries and honey. Such a great tasting waffle but not value for money"
57,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had an amazing time, their tea is super good, the decoration is super cool and it feels really cozy. The staff is also super nice. I totally recommand if you need to stop in the area for a nice drink and a good snack :)"

67,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Happy service with a smile and great tasty kebab wraps, thoroughly recommend after a good night out!"
68,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 1 star ,2 years ago,Need to learn basic dietary requirements. Same gloved used on raw meat and then handled waffles and strawberries in front of me. Did not order and walked out. NOT SUITABLE FOR VEGETARIANS!
69,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,3 years ago,It‚Äôs a crepe and waffle place.
70,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Is slightly pricey but tastes good!
71,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had the Spicy Mexican crepe which was full of flavour and a decent portion for only 7.80 EUR. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to try classic Dutch waffles and crepes! Great service too!
72,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, freshly prepared.  Friendly staff."
73,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 1 star ,2 years ago,We ordered a waffle with ice cream. The waffle did not look appetizing and does not taste good at all. The consistency of the waffle was soggy and not fresh at all. The place was so hot. We choose this place because of the pictures in google. Not good experience!
74,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My favourite place in the world! Quick service with a smile. A wide array of savoury/sweet crepes, waffles, milkshakes & smoothies. It's plastic cutlery but you won't get a better crepe in Amsterdam."
75,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely little place in the heart of Amsterdam's tourist area, run by British owners I think (all staff I've met are of British descent). They serve both sweet and savoury cr√™pes and waffles; you can pick from a few popular topping/filling ‚Ä¶"
76,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very tasty crepes and nice prices.
Edited: also waffels are awesome."
77,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place looks nice and the staff are really kind. However, waffles were premade and only warmed up (and they smell like ham??). Plates were dirty (cannot justify that)."
78,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 1 star ,2 years ago,"While the man who took the order explained that the waffles and stroop waffles were made fresh, the young lady preparing them took an old pre-cooked waffle off the counter ledge and put it on the waffle iron. Afterward she lifted the cover ‚Ä¶"
79,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It was a good place to eat out in Amsterdam especially for Waffels
80,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice warm strip waffle with coconut. Expensive but would recommend.
81,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"What is there not to like in this place! Every time I visit Amsterdam this is always a stop on the list of places to visit and never let's us down. From healthy to the filthiest and tastiest crepes in the market, this place gets it right ‚Ä¶"
82,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I tried their waffle with Nutella and it was ok; but nothing too special. They also had other toppings and combination of toppings you can choose from. ‚Ä¶
83,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good crepes, good coffee, good orange juice.  The meal is not prepared as quickly as the atmosphere implies. Don't come in a hurry. ‚Ä¶"
84,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Freshly made waffles.I ordered a waffle New York cheesecake but it was too sweet.  The crepe chocolate was really tasty. Would recommend.
85,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Waffles are not made to order or fresh, they come out of a drawer under the waffle iron and are reheated (to order!) in same. Mine was undercooked, the topping, apple cinnemon was cold and tasted having come out of a tin. Anyone with a ‚Ä¶"
86,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Low quality and expensive.
Waffles are not freshly baked, only warmed up.
You can find better for 7 euro waffle."
87,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty mediocre food, and staff enjoyed putting a disgusting amount of Nutella on my churros despite my request for a very small amount. But it was also 3am, and they were ok tasting so... 3 stars."
88,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place for waffles and crepes! Hot waffles with generous servings of toppings üôÇ Staff are great and very friendly. Seating area is nicely laid out and has a toilet for customers (a bonus in Amsterdam).
89,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Bummer you guys are closed, I had a great waffle!"
90,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Really subpar pancakes for a lot of $$$$$
I ordered a plain pancake with one scoop of ice cream to go and it was over $6 euro and they threw it on a flimsy piece of styrofoam plate. The pancake itself was chewy but rather tasteless. Not worth it"
91,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Calories galore but a great selection of classic Belgian waffles, stroopwafels and cr√™pes. There are also several varieties of milkshakes to gorge on though I did feel a little ill afterwards!"
92,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you are in Amsterdam and it happens that you walk out of a coffeshop happy, hungry and sleepy ;)  then this is a place to satisfy both your hunger and your sweet taste receptors on your tongue... Go for the fruits if you can't handle a serious sugar rush from a nuttella waffle"
93,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Got the waffles and Ice-cream but the scoops they gave us were small compared to other places I've been. The waffles were freshly made for us which was nice.
94,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Yes yes yes to this place! Waffles are soooo good after a night of smoking.
95,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Nothing special :/
96,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Took 30 minutes for one of our crepes to come out. Expensive for what you get. With so many other all day breakfast options in the area, we will not be returning."
97,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice and friendly. I had the Old Dutch Crepe which I was pleasantly surprised by. It could have been warmer so voted down 1 star. It was nice place to sit and people watch.
98,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good waffles üëç
99,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Gluttony, thy name is waffles and Nutella. Amazing, could only go for one of these once every month or so, just to make sure you don't ruin your calorie counts :)"
100,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 2 stars ,3 years ago,First of all the music was too loud - was hard to even hear my thoughts. We ordered crepe that was very poor and chowe - can't recommend it - go to some other places...
101,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Order your serve of delicious-ness at the counter. Waffle, crepe or Stroopwaffle, loads of toppings, cream or ice cream. Tea and coffee was good. Fantastic waffles, great service."
102,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious! Small and in the thick of tourist shopping but it was worth milling through the crowd.  Crepe had a very, very slight crispness to it that I loved."
103,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Waffles are nice but a little bit overpriced. You can actually get the same waffles twice cheaper at IKEA.  I asked for Americano and I got an esspreso in a tiny cup
104,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We've been to Amsterdam twice now, and this was the first place we wanted to eat at once we got there! Definitely a MUST! The waffles and amazing and the crepes are ginormous!"

106,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great dessert place!
107,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very tasty and the prices are okay
108,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice people. Don't speak dutch but that's logical in this area. Waffle average, cr√™pe delicious,  stroopwafel has nothing to do with the original dutch stroopwafel"
109,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best waffles I ever ate + special dutch stropwaffles. They have different jam or sauce for your waffles .
110,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 1 star ,4 years ago,Next time I'm in Amsterdam I hope I won't lose myself by smashing and burning down this ridiculous wafflehouse. Calling for the assasination of Donald Trump by collecting tips to make that possible. This shop must be clossed and those skanks working there should de deported
111,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I ordered the m&ms pancake with chocolate sauce. I come here every time I visit Amsterdam, its just amazing üòç and reasonably priced."
112,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Me and my partner absolutely loved here!! Chocolate crepes and strawberries.  The friendliest one in the dam
113,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The place doesn't look much from the outside. But believe me, it's one of the best for waffles and crepes. The people inside quite helpful and polite."
114,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice hot waffles with Nutella and strawberries with ice cream. But you can pretty much chose any combination that you want!
115,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Ok place for waffles and crepes
116,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious waffles and a good size to for a good price. Would definitely go here again.
117,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Good, reasonably priced food with friendly service.

The shop and seating do, to be honest, feel barely a step up from basic takeaway. Shame as the surroundings don't live up to the food."
118,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love the ""Chocolate Peanutbutter Milkshake"" there! So much Peanutbutter in a Milkshake is great. The Waffles are very good as well!"
119,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Would prefer my crepe to have more chocolate filling. The crepe dough was excellent and fresh.
120,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious waffles and a good size to for a good price. Would definitely go here again.
121,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice and friendly. I had the Old Dutch Crepe which I was pleasantly surprised by. It could have been warmer so voted down 1 star. It was nice place to sit and people watch.

129,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best Crepes in Amsterdam!
130,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Products ok, service very disrespectful. Setting your order is confusing and they act as if you are guilty for not knowing how everything works. Smokey dopey guys."
131,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly staff. Nice food. Not cheap and not sure why coffee was unavailable even though machine was on.
132,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,a year ago,If you love waffles and crepes and if you are a sweet tooth then this is tbe place
133,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,5 years ago,It was ok. But there are much better locally owned pancake shops in the area. I would recommend The Happy Pig üòä
134,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty, but I was left quite hungry after my meal and felt a little sick for the rest of the day after eating here."
135,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Not particularly tasty food. Good service, a bit better than the other tourist traps in the red light district"
136,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Every time I go to Amsterdam i try to come here. Its better than any of the other waffle places I've found in the centre.
137,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Honestly i eat better crepes, they were kind of dry guess he left to bake tooling, and they hot dry, i had better on another place"
138,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Waffles were alright and fresh made, in my opinion should be baked a bit longer, but far to expensive."
139,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good food and good service. Friendly servers but small space. Was hard to bring in buggies
140,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 3 stars ,5 years ago,It was ok. But there are much better locally owned pancake shops in the area. I would recommend The Happy Pig üòä
141,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Waffles and stroopwafels are unique, but better be sure to serve with not so sweet sauce"

148,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A great place to satisfy your sugar cravings (read Nutella waffle)
149,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The beat crepes in town and the staffs are sooo nice
150,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 1 star ,4 years ago,They have put a tip box on the counter and it says: contribute to the slaughter of Trump. I think this is disgusting. You cannot do such things. Where is the respect
151,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Great place to get a quick sugar fix or if your looking for something more savory you can have a breakfast crepe.
152,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Expensive, packed and flat taste. On the flip side portions are large."
153,Mondial Crepes & Waffles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing stroopwafel ... Delicious
