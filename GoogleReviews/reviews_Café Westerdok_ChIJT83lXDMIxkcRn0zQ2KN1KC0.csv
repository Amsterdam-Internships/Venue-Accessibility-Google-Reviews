5,Café Westerdok, 1 star ,3 years ago,High cracklady not being able to do a normal conversation behind the bar. Don’t know if she’s the owner but trashtalking customers isn’t very charming. They had some nice tap beers though. But she had no idea of what they were or anything so that doesn’t really do it either..
