0,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"BEST Mint Chocolate Chip Icecream I  have had in The Netherlands! Highly recommend passing by for some icecream. Very popular place, easy to find, friendly workers. Prices are good for the quality you get."
1,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,6 months ago,This brings me back memories! Been here when I was a kid and used to go there after we went to bowling. I love their icecream :)
2,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"You aren't going to find better Ice Cream than this in the Netherlands. This is the most Genuine Italian Ice Cream I have found in Amsterdam. I love all their flavours, but my favourite is the After Eight, which has deliciously uneven broken chunks of actual chocolate in it. The Best!"
3,Pisa IJs, 4 stars ,6 months ago,The ice cream is okay. Not really good and bad. U can get this kind of ice cream in all the ice cream shop.
4,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very tasty and they have vegan options :)
5,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best ice cream/Gelato in town and it feels like we've tried them all. Lots of flavours to choose from including some that are unusual in the Netherlands like zabaglione and After Eight mint chocolate. Super creamy and full of flavor. We always buy a big tub to take home too!
6,Pisa IJs, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Tasty gelato but on the relatively sweet side, service is okay and functional. Lines tend to be long. You can expect to pay ‚Ç¨3.6-+ for 2 scoops of ice cream. Would recommend but I personally prefer Veneti√´ and Massimo."
7,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place has some of the best ice cream I've ever had. Every single time I go to Amsterdam, I have to stop by a few times. There can be long waiting times during the summer but it is very worth it!"
8,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,5 months ago,So nice selection of ice cream you just can't resist üç®
9,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really good ice creams! Excellent texture and you won‚Äôt get a sugar rush.
10,Pisa IJs, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Overly sweet ice cream. It‚Äôs ok.
11,Pisa IJs, 1 star ,7 months ago,I can't believe this ice cream shop has so many good reviews. By far the least tasteful ice cream in Amsterdam. It tastes like cheap candy.
12,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"One of the best ice creams in Amsterdam, I wish they use less sugar on the pistachio one."
13,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Ridiculously tasty and cheap ice cream
14,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best icecream in Amsterdam! And open until midnight. What more can you ask for?
15,Pisa IJs, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Friendly staff , my dog got a cookie. The ice cream is better than many competitors but not as good as some."
16,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Probably one of the best Italian ice cream in Amsterdam, much better than others in the same area. All the people working there are are Italian including the beautiful lady owning the place! The shop is only open in the warmer months of the ‚Ä¶"
17,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best authentic icecream Amsterdam has to offer!! After eight 4ever
18,Pisa IJs, 1 star ,2 years ago,Another google points and comments failure and disappointment! This was the one of most sugared ice creams I have eaten. The taste felt weak for both coconut and yogurt cherry flavor while the sugar percentages were at a peak. Terrible terrible.
19,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best gelato in this area and maybe all of Amsterdam. Varied flavors so there is something for everyone. You can also take home in larger quantities. And they close late which is quite rare here.
20,Pisa IJs, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Been regular for 2 years. Great ice cream, not so good service. We thought they would be happy with exact change but came 50 cent short, promised to walk home and come straight back, when they became quite upset. Of course we went home and brought back the 50 cent, but this is no way to treat a regular client; never going back."
21,Pisa IJs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good, great ice cream actually but quite expensive. There are equally good ice cream shops around where you get more bang for your buck. The servers are not all too friendly neither, but it was steaming hot outside. I can imagine they'd rather be somewhere else:-)"
22,Pisa IJs, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"What makes Italian icecream so special, is that it's full of natural flavour. This is, by far, among the sweetest icecreams I have ever tasted. So rich in sugar it tastes like syrup. We tried 7 flavours between us and they were all equally as dense. Can't recommend it over others."
23,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,best REAL ITALIAN ice cream to go in the neighborhood of the RAI exhibition center. Huge selection of ice cream tastes. Prices in the dutch average. There might be a lot of queue especially  during weekends but it's really worth waiting a bit.
24,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The BEST gelato you can find in the entire country. True Italian ice cream / sorbets. You will never forgive yourself if you don't get a cup of sorbet or ice cream from them.
25,Pisa IJs, 1 star ,a year ago,Don‚Äôt go there!!! Staff is extremely rude and unfriendly. And racist. They don‚Äôt care about their customers. I‚Äôve been here a few times now with different friends and every time we are in shock about their behaviour. The ice cream is ‚Ä¶
26,Pisa IJs, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The ice cream is great but today 20/06, Saturday 9pm. the guy at the shop stopped selling because the queue was too ""long""."
27,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"What is interesting is that they sell sorbet, italian ice, gelato and ice cream. The differences between these is what they use as the base (cream versus milk versus ice). It doesn't matter which flavor or type you get, you are in for a delicious treat. The yogurt flavor was amazingly tasty, tart and sweet."
28,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great Ice Cream! Can highly recommend both the Straciatella and Cookie Dough flavours.
üÑΩüÑæüÖÉüÑ¥ - Only open from early March until late October."
29,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great ice cream!!!
Friendly staff..."
30,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious ice cream! Can get a bit crowded. Great for a summer evening ice cream cone. You can sit at some benches near the shop and enjoy your treat.
31,Pisa IJs, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The ice cream is too sweet, portions are small, prices aren't clearly marked and the tissues they give you to wipe your hands/face with seem to be made from plastic"
32,Pisa IJs, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Too sweet and too much sugar in my view... Chocolate was the best of the available choices but overall not the best in Amsterdam. Massimo in pijp or Monte Pelmo in jordaan are much better ice cream shops
33,Pisa IJs, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It's called the best ice cream in Amsterdam by many. Although it is not bad in any way, it was nothing special either. You can go there, just don't expect anything amazing."
34,Pisa IJs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"used to be my favorite italian gelato in Amsterdam ( now i prefer massimo gelato)
i like the structure of the ice cream here but find its too sweet
recommend : chocolate , orange yogurt , yogurt , banana"
35,Pisa IJs, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Ice cream is good but service can be terrible. Today I canceled my order and left because the guy attending me was being extremely rude and hostile. Next time I will just go to Venetie, which is just a few meters away."
36,Pisa IJs, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Great icecream, rude italian guy working there."
37,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,5 years ago,There is usually a line but well worth the wait. These are so tasty - I really don't know how they get the flavors so exact and concentrated. ‚Ä¶
38,Pisa IJs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ottimo! Excellent! The ice cream has really good quality. The staff is very friendly, even when the stand is very busy"
