0,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"A really unique coffeeshop in Amsterdam won't find another like this. Cool looking under water interior , plenty of tables for guests. Produce itself isn't expensive, can be busy at times. Very chilled timed to be had would recommend spending some time in here"
1,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Beautiful interior, welcoming staff and good coffee."
2,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Best coffeshop in Amsterdam. Great staff, always super friendly and welcoming. The smoking area downstairs looks like a old submarine. It‚Äôs an amazing experience too chill there.The products are also of very good quality and fair price. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
3,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Had a really bad experience here. The waitress was really passive aggressive and there's just an overall bad vibe in this place. Then to make things even worse, we were sitting downstairs smoking, I looked down and noticed a mouse running around. Disgusting."
4,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Had a last minute stop here before we left town. Grabbed a few pre-rolls which were just decent and a space cake before the plane ride. Hope it‚Äôs good because a long flight ahead. The shop is decorated really cool and the owner seemed friendly and professional.
5,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very nice place to stay and chill... It is one of the oldest Coffeeshops in Amsterdam... Prices are well and the shop is beautiful painted and full of sweet things on the wall which is made like a Lagune under water #highlyrecommended
6,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was here 10 years ago and always wanted to come back, the place hasn't changed, it was like walking back in time again. Lovely place, knowledgeable staff and a great place to chill in. Keep the good work up guys, see you in another 10 years. üòÅüòÅüòÅ"
7,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The woman rushed us and was also taking someone else order, I was dissapointed because they told me this was the best coffee shop in Amsterdam. She also told us we couldnt smoke it there and then we asked for a coffee at least to go and she said we couldnt have it to go. So a simple spliff was our purchase."
8,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Adding for a wasted friend that visited 20 years ago. He still insists that ""WhiteDolphin"" sold here around 2000 was the best he's had. ‚Ä¶"
9,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This groovy establishment is located in a very central part of the city that deserves exploration. The staff were super helpful in setting up a very clean and ""orderly"" vaporizer, and they showed me and my girlfriend what to do, and ‚Ä¶"
10,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"My personal favorite place in Amsterdam very comfortable and pleasant
The staff is amazing and always fun to come back to"
11,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Good music, large choice, nice team, cool music. Loooove it!"
12,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Perhaps the strongest pure joints in Amsterdam...

But now it's February of 2048, and the cat and great look can't undo the poisonously hard-sell vibe. You can for some reason not smoke joints on site..."
13,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,a month ago,best staff if u r in lucky day and the nice place for chill
14,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly and welcoming.  Good music and a goof mix of customers. Great advice if needed and a good Hot Chocolate.... essential for late Jan.
15,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice, friendly staff who explained quantities nicely. Had a Chocolate muffin... which led to a great night's sleep!"
16,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,4 months ago,Awful place. Owner adds on 2% to all cards no matter how much you spend. Weird rules also. Avoid if you want to be chill.
17,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Friendly staff. Nice strains. Great atmosphere.
Edibles are delicious üòãüòé‚úåüèº"
18,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very hippie and color one. Cozy music with a big comfortable sofa, but no A/C in the smoking area..."
19,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"First coffe shop iv been , and it's very expensive compare to others due to location,  and you can't smoke weed with tobacco inside which is not ideal if you like joints"
20,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This is the place to go before starting your day. Been going for 10 years here, top class products, top class services."
21,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Very cool place with some great stuff on sale. Staff member was slightly brusque and business like for my taste but perhaps that was a busy day.
22,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing space cake
Good place to chill and smoke
Very explaining service about the cake ‚Ä¶"
23,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I was here about two years ago. Then it was great. Friendly staff. Fine selection. Cute downstairs area to smoke.

24,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My favourite CoffeeShop in Amsterdam.. Such a nice chilled atmosphere.. Great friendly staff..AMAZING PLACE.. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE!!!
25,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best Coffeeshops I have ever been. Thank you for your good service ladies.
26,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,a year ago,"The problem was the employer took it as  personal insult that my pal put up his legs on the sofa (cause of the severe pain in his leg) We told him, but as I said didn't show any slight of understanding. Fokin good goods but never go back and can't recommend cause of the reason I mentioned. Rude and very sensitive staff..."
27,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A wonderful Gaudi marine environment to relax in. The staff is warm and professional. Very good selection, expect to buy a soft drink too."
28,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good vibes and friendly staff. Weed selection is not very large but prices are quite good considering their location. Quality is really nice and love the baggies it comes in! Definitely one to keep! The whole theme is very cool and when u ‚Ä¶
29,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was one of my favourite stops in Amsterdam when I visited in 2017! The atmosphere and decor is beautiful, imaginative, immersive, and relaxing. The strains available there were varied and well priced, and the food and drink ‚Ä¶"
30,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,Four of us went in on Tuesday lunchtime. Went to buy a 25‚Ç¨ gram of kief. Was asked to buy at least 3 grams for us to sit in. Ironically would have spent over 100‚Ç¨ had they not been so desperate to take in a few more euros right away. Left without buying. The atmosphere was non existent as there were only 2 people there.. don't visit
31,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The inside is nice, however I felt very forced into doing anything by the lady, which compared to my other coffee shop experiences, was very different and unpleasant. The weed they sell is very mediocre, but fairly cheap. If you want a good coffee shop experience avoid this. Especially if it is your first experience."
32,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Have visited this place several times and normally receive great service. One of the female members is incredibly rude pretty much told us to buy our weed and get out, because there wasn't room for us, despite there only being 4 of us, and ‚Ä¶"
33,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,Came here after seeing good reviews was not welcomed at all. All 4 of us told we had to purchase a gram and drink to sit in. Lady shouted at me as I took a photo (nowhere does it say no photos). Workers stared at us walking up and down past ‚Ä¶
34,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst staff!! Woman behind the bar with the curly brown hair has a really bad attitude. Yelling at customers and humiliating people seems to be her thing. Spend your money at a place that appreciates their customers, this place is horrible. You've been warned."
35,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really great shop,with a fantastic owner. As per usual brilliant service and the nice thing about this place is that it's not full of the usual stag parties from another European country. The other good things are that is reasonably priced ‚Ä¶"
36,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The decor is awesome but our experience was ruined somewhat by the staff rushing us to make a decision and making us buy more weed than we needed - ""you'll have to buy at least this much if you're going to stay"" - and we were ushered ‚Ä¶"
37,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very unwelcoming, wouldn‚Äôt let me sit down at a table before ordering, had 8 people so one of us wanted to grab a table and wait for the others whilst they were ordering. The guys said this was not aloud and he physically stood in my way. So we left as other places in Amsterdam are much more welcoming!"
38,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Female staff member felt she was either 'above' customers or just straight up didn't want to be there. Asked about cakes, she got one pre-packaged out of the fridge, chucked it on the counter without even looking at us. Pre-rolled products ‚Ä¶"
39,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Used to be a great place, now there's some angry lady behind the counter who simply scares most people away. Went in to have muffins and hot chocolate, only to be told that we can't sit and have them because muffins are for takeaway only ‚Ä¶"
40,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere. You do have to buy their 'produce' in order to stay, but it is understandable due to the rising competition of coffeeshops.
The muffins and coffee taste amazing, though. Home-baked muffins, ‚Ä¶"
41,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place with great crew!
Very good environment
This place most be in your check list!"
42,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lots to look at. Downstairs is for tobacco smokers. As the name suggests, very aquatic theme. Upstairs coral reef, downstairs submarine. Friendly staff, kept nice and clean. Good, though limited menu and advice."
43,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,2 years ago,One of the first coffee shops I ever went in back in 2005 and the decor hasn't changed. It has a psychedelic marine coral interior that just gets better the more you smoke. They have a seperate tobacco smoking room upstairs. Weed quality good if not spetacular & they don't do 5 gram deals.
44,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Walked in with 3 friends for a casual smoke and coffee after dinner on a rainy Sunday evening. We went to sit down at a table and were told none of us could sit down before ordering and we had to order a minimum of 1 gram and 1 drink per ‚Ä¶
45,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice coffe shop, friend dlry staff and nice products , recommend ."
46,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Like being on the yellow submarine! An underwater themed coffee shop. Very friendly bud tenders with good produce. Downstairs is comfy and they also have vaporizers you can use. Also one of the only shops open till late and in the upper part of the city. The cakes here are fantastic highly recommend.
47,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Extremely nice location for anyone wishing to have a decent, fresh and smooth bud in Amsterdam. The staff is exceptional, and super friendly. I would recommend going there during daylight as we had the most fun going there then :)"
48,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Pros: strong herb, nice cat, cool decorations and art, comfy seats downstairs.
Cons: you need to buy drinks with your bud to have it inside, you will be asked every 15 minutes if you are good, the staff are rude to people just minding thier own business.
It's okay."
49,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice chill area downstairs that doesn‚Äôt have the pumped up hyped up atmosphere at all like other tourist traps. Weed is a little on the more expensive side and the filling isn‚Äôt amazing quality but the vibe is very chill and laid back which central coffee shops often lack
50,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fancy shop, they got their own branded buds. And this store has bongs/water bongs at disposal. This is not often, be sure to drop by to check this out. Price is ok but in my opinion a little bit higher than usual. Staff is friendly and will gladly assist you, so all in all was a great experience!"
51,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Funky unique place. Stationary, ready to go, led colored vaporizers. Amazing cat. Limited selection. One intense/borderline rude budtender. Seeing other reviews, seems like the biggest complaint is the staff and it‚Äôs probably the same lady I saw."
52,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best, coziest and friendliest Coffee Shop in Amsterdam! The decor is beautifully ocean-inspired,  the menu is small but great and the place just screams for a relaxing stay with a fresh orange juice and a joint. Its by-far our ‚Ä¶"
53,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,2 years ago,everyone out of your group have to buy a drink to be allowed to have a seat even if you buyed cannabis products from them and there is a lot of free tables. Otherweise youre not welcome ! It's good quality weed there(but expensive too) location is pretty chill
54,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice small coffee shop worth finding if ever in Amsterdam and on a weed tour of the city. I would recommended the northern lights. If you go in a large group the shop assistant will ask for most of the group to buy weed and drinks
55,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool Coffee shop, very organized and helpful staff"
56,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Visited last weekend and was blown away by the atmosphere. Staff were lovely and very knowledgeable, drinks were reasonably priced and I love the underwater vibe. Thank you for your great hospitality. Back in January. Xxx"
57,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I don‚Äôt write many reviews but from our first moments in there, the people were aggressive straight away and felt uncomfortable. The waitresses kept coming over every 5 m to tell us off for having our own water bottles and kept reminding that you have to pay to stay there. Really not a chill place to have a smoke at all"
58,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"This was my third visit to the bar and this time it wasn‚Äôt that great, first time I went we were welcomed really warmly and everyone was very helpful. Second time the prices has ramped up very high and there were new rules but I would still ‚Ä¶"
59,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Used to be a cool place and still is as far as the decor goes.  I used to come here years ago and loved it.  Now you are forced to buy 1 gram per person just to stay plus a drink each.  4 grams of weed for 4 people is a lot of weed!  We ‚Ä¶
60,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My first time for weed. I went to this shop as a friend recommended me. I bought a joint and a cannabis cake. 2 hours after eating the cake, I had no effect and I went back for refund. The girl (black girl) amazingly listened to me, sat ‚Ä¶"

63,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely coffeeshop but they make you buy their weed if you want to stay.
64,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Positive: very chilling music, except
sometimes the song tends to repeat itself
The lowest floor is very nice to seat in ‚Ä¶"
65,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Personally, it's the first coffee shop I've been in when I first Visited Amsterdam. Loved it and every time I've visited since I kept bringing friends there. It's now all my friend's special little coffee shop. ‚Ä¶"
66,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Yes, unfortunately the lady has this very strong sativa personality, that lacks the friendly demeanor. Yes, this coffeeshop is a themed one, which I'm not really a fan of. Do I recommend, not currently. If the lady smokes some Indica once in a while, the place will get better."
67,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I needed to urgently use the toilette before buying material from this place (I was waiting the big line) and they didn‚Äôt allowed me before waiting my turn. The arabic person attending people was very rude (I‚Äôm not racist, only to designate ‚Ä¶"

69,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Good shop.  You have to pay for weed or hash first then you can buy tea or coffee.  Vaporizers for use by requires a ten euro deposit.  Yes they are business minded and they have their system.  If you don't like it go somewhere else.  I like this place a lot.
70,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Staff is friendly, menu is ok."
71,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I don't know why this place has bad reviews at all. Whatever happened to those people, its the total opposite of my experience. The staff was totally cool with me and my girlfriend. They didn't push us to buy anything and were totally ‚Ä¶"
72,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,5 years ago,The staff appeared nice and gave regular customer service but they were very rude. The owner said some comment as I was leaving. Refused to give me a little bit of hot water for my tea which I bought there. Was told I had to puchase again ‚Ä¶
73,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is very comfortable. People is friendly, altho no the cheapest, you will find great quality"
74,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,4 months ago,"bad service, rude man, experience never to be repeated."
75,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A little overpriced and they make you buy an expensive drink to go downstairs! but really nice staff none-the-less with cool and unique underwater interior! Try their space cakes!
76,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,3 years ago,We decided to go in a few times as our hotel was next door to it. But unlike any other coffee shop I have been in they made me buy 2g when there was 3 of us wanting to sit downstairs. They also made all of us buy a drink or we couldnt stay ‚Ä¶
77,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,5 years ago,We entered and we're immediately told the minimum spend after a quick and choppy hello and we were processed downstairs to the sofas. We bought over ‚Ç¨100 of product and after 30 minutes were asked to not play cards because they wouldn't be ‚Ä¶
78,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"They force you to buy one gram per person to sit down, if not you can only buy the prerolled ones for 7.5 euros. They have a pack of 4 rollies, but when we asked for it they said it is not available, so we pay. Quite a tourist trap to be honest."
79,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The staff won't stop asking you how are you and if you want to consume something even if it is clear that you are fine like that. It goes beyond being helpful into being truly annoying. Would have recommended it untik some years ago. The space muffins are quite strong though.
80,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great little shop with a good selection of product.

Over two floors, tobacco smoking is only permitted downstairs (that includes ‚Ä¶"

84,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,a year ago,Hot chocolate was top and service was amazing
85,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"We were rushed immediately, with the waitress taking no sympathy on the fact we had never set foot in the shop before. She was rude and generally unpleasant. After we were seated, she would increase pressure to finish as soon as possible and it left us unable to relax. There are much better coffee shops"
86,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worst place ever. After about 20 minutes I was asked "" do you  inhale"" and was told I was "" polluting the air"". Mind you  I was smoking 0 tobacco all herb. Never in a million years would I ever have thought that I would be ""polluting"" a ‚Ä¶"
87,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,3 years ago,The lady behind the counter is rude as can be.  I'm staying at the hotel across the street and stopped in earlier and bought a few grams of bud.   At the end of the day I'm on my way back to the hotel to smoke a joint I previously bought. ‚Ä¶

90,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The Dolphins is my most favourite coffee shop in Amsterdam. The staff are warm, friendly and polite and are very helpful when it comes to making selections of their wonderful produce. I would highly recommend the muffins (take out only) and the mint tea"
91,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,4 years ago,Felt rushed!! Not much selection.  4 weeds. 4 hashes.  few Specials. Keep saying to me if u smoke tobacco go down stairs. Would of been politer to ask if use tobacco or not. Just some people need to learn customer skills.
92,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This is my most fave coffeeshop. I love dolphins and have swam with them. Mixing fave mammal underwater theme. And weed I was in canna heaven:) ‚Ä¶
93,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The last years at the Dolphins I was always satisfied but this year I felt ashamed infront of my friends. The lady working there was kinda rude and it was not ""enough"" for her that we wanted to buy 2 Buds and 4 drinks with 4 guys. So good luck for the future and hopefully you'll change your behaviour. Peace !"
94,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My girlfriend and I went here to get a muffin. The place was very nice and characteristics, the staff was friendly.

95,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The interior is beautiful but the atmosphere is horrible. Their main focus is to squeeze as much money as possible. Upon entry everyone must buy their product (from a poor menu), proceed to the table, smoke fast, don't play cards etc as you ‚Ä¶"

100,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Very bad costumer service. Waitress very fake attitude. Besides they force you to buy 1 gram per person to be there? Worst coffee shop I‚Äôve ever visited. And it is not that nice, they‚Äôre are way better coffeeshops all over Amsterdam. Ibiza, Katsu, Dampkring, 1eHulp, Greenhouse, Bulldog, Club Media .. to name a few."

108,Dolphins Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It's worth a visit. The place is wonderfully decorated. You feel like you visit a coral reef. The staff is nice too. It's one of my favourites places in Amsterdam.
