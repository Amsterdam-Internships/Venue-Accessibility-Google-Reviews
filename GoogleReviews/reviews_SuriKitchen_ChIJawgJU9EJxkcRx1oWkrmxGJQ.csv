0,SuriKitchen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Sandwiches taste very good and have reasanoble prices. Very friendly staff. Definitely recommend!
1,SuriKitchen, 1 star ,2 years ago,Do you realise how loud your filter is and that all the smell coming into the apartments? It's 1:30am and the kitchen is still working and my bedroom is smelly. Sometimes your back door is open at 4am and able to hear the workers talking. If it doesn't stop further action will be taken! This is unacceptable!
2,SuriKitchen, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Inedible roti, had to throw it away, drenched in 2 fingers of water, egg was grey inside, chicken was shredded and looked like it was chewed on and the roti itself was dry of texture. Waste of money when there is an abundance of good roti ‚Ä¶"
3,SuriKitchen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Surprisingly good. Had an excellent Roti. Service is a bit slow though. But who cares if the food is good.
4,SuriKitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice big Soto soup for low price. I love this place and people who work there are nice.

12,SuriKitchen, 1 star ,9 months ago,(Translated by Google) What a bad service and unhygienic too ..! Think to get a sandwich during my break. I communicate with the lady and after the checkout I continue my telephone conversation. Madam tells me to wear my face mask properly ‚Ä¶
13,SuriKitchen, 5 stars ,7 months ago,(Translated by Google) Super tasty saoto soup. It's almost impossible for me to walk past this place without feeling the attraction of the sandwiches and all the delicious food I've already gotten here. ‚Ä¶

17,SuriKitchen, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"(Translated by Google) The food is pretty good. The interior is only very dilapidated, which makes the environment look a bit shabby. ‚Ä¶"
18,SuriKitchen, 1 star ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Just picked up an online order, and really very disappointed. The vegetarian roti with bean curd and tempeh had no bean curd and tempeh, and was therefore only a container with potatoes and beans. The VEGETARIAN saoto ‚Ä¶"

23,SuriKitchen, 1 star ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) first times fantastic, today absolutely bad: tasteless potatoes, tough, dry roti, watery sauce and the garter tasted like sugar ... and to top it all off: there was hardly any meat on the dry chicken. ‚Ä¶"
24,SuriKitchen, 1 star ,4 years ago,"(Translated by Google) 2 sandwiches. And both not completely eaten. Very floury shrimp, no structure at all, weird color too. Have probably been frozen for a long time. The chicken curry, surely the most ordered sandwich in many Surinamese ‚Ä¶"
25,SuriKitchen, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Quality of the dishes delivered by SuriKitchen is not always consistent. A counter clerk scribbling at his hair who is then packing your food does not make a good impression. For me, an address to pass by. ‚Ä¶"
26,SuriKitchen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,(Translated by Google) Fabulous vegetarian roti with tempeh and tofu. One downside that we could not get the second time because potatoes had run out. Other dishes were tasty but not as phenomenal as the roti ‚Ä¶
27,SuriKitchen, 1 star ,4 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Today ordered from you again after a long time. Is there another cook? The roti was watery, the vegetables bland. The roti chicken had an almost meatless chicken leg. I was always very enthusiastic. Such a pity... ‚Ä¶"
