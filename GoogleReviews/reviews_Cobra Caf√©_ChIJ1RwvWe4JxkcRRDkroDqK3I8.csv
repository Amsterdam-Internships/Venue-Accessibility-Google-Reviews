0,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Nice café, their cappuccino with oatmeal was perfect,   according to the best Italian tradition. Their sandwiches are also very tasty and healthy alternatives, like brown bread, are available. The waiters are very thoughtful: my daughter …"
1,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,a year ago,For a quick snack this place was not only convenient after our museum visits but also the Nacho's were great. They even put the cheese on the power levels of the Nacho stack so each one was great. The waiters were really friendly and if I may say handsome so all round a pleasant pit stop!
2,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"A good place for lunch before or after visiting one of the museums. We had very tasty toasted sandwiches, followed by their delicious, famous apple pie. Very busy the whole time we were there and the tables were quite rightly packed together. The staff remained friendly and were working really hard"
3,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a coffee and apple pie. I do recommend this place for coffee and cake.
Toilets are public, and cost €1. When you give the ticket of the toilet to your waiter, they will credit the money from your check.
Toilets are nice and clean as well. Very good atmosphere."
4,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very friendly staff and drinks as well as food were reasonably priced and of good quality. Huge Nacho portion with trimmings worth ordering :-) Also perfect location when checking out the museums around.  Would recommend a visit!
5,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Had a humours wait-staff, enjoyable experience, fluet in English, €13 for coffee and 'The best apple pie in Holland'....it was wonderful not quiet the best. You'll have to test it out yourself"
6,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,5 months ago,It's a nice restaurant near the Rijks and Van Gogh Muzeum.
7,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Friendly staff. Nice snacks
8,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great for a quick bite near the Rijksmuseum. The place is very crowded, but staff is friendly. Lots of languages spoken. The Smoked Chicken Avocado Salad and the sandwich of the same name were good, but slightly disappointing because the …"
9,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Had lunch here with friends and it was amazing. The Old Amsterdam sandwich and poffertjes are delicious! Staff was friendly, location is beautiful, and the food came super quickly."
10,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Worst place to take anything. Very expensive site and they don't have toilets either. I asked before take anything and they confirm me, but the surprise later it was that the toilets were outside of the caffe and I needed to pay for it. Don't recommend I don't like nobody lies me"
11,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Fireplaces, many seats and view on museuplein. It also has an outside part.Only had a coffee and a winter tea (photo): 6 euros ca. The tables and chairs could be a bit more clean!"
12,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Apple pie was OK, not as special as they say though. Really touristy place. Not a place for a quiet & nice lunch. For a quick bite after the visit to the rijksmuseum it is great."
13,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"OK... So rather obviously a tourist place, not much to report I thought... BUT!!! The pea soup was simply delicious! Rich and with a nice slice of dark bread with ham and mustard (!) - really excellent and good value (6.50 Euros) for the …"
14,Cobra Caf√©, 2 stars ,2 years ago,A convenient place to have something refreshing before going back towards the city center. Beside that the service was slow not really friendly and we were asking the bill to pay for like 20minutes and in the end we had to go to the bar to pay.
15,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Staff was very helpful and kind. Although there was a mistaken in our order, they corrected very quickly."
16,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Really nice place next to the museum center. Good and fast service.
17,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice terras, tables and chairs can use a cleaning. Service quite good."
18,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food although the menu is limited, reasonable prices, with a popular view of the IamAmsterdam Words. I think that customers who eat at the café shouldn't pay for the toilet."
19,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,5 months ago,We waited for a while and even changed seats to be more visible but were still ignored by the waiters.
20,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Great central location in the middle of the museum district. Efficient service and good food

24,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Nice terrace to have a couple of Heineken in the sun while scrolling over Museum Square
25,Cobra Caf√©, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,It takes hours for waiters to come to your table
26,Cobra Caf√©, 2 stars ,2 months ago,You know what we heat up the apple juice and sell it as gluhwein
27,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,7 months ago,"They should not ask people sitting in the public , iamsterdam bench , not to smoke. Don't put your tables so close. And surely never ask the public to change for You."
28,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,3 years ago,A bit of a tourist trap but nice enough. Staff were friendly and food was okay.
29,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Been here numerous times early before appointments at the consulate, and have always had great service and great food. The morning staff is incredibly friendly! The past three times it’s been the same two waitresses, and they are cheerful …"
30,Cobra Caf√©, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We had lunch here sitting outside on Tuesday, with great food and service from the staff who were under some pressure when it started a typical (as we have noticed) Amsterdam liquid sunshine moment. With this in mind, we called in again …"
31,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Love the service haha
Waiter from Italy was great 👍 they also have great apple pie, big portions and nice taste!"
32,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Very healthy, beautiful food, very nice place, quiet and peaceful.
And the owners: there is no words how much nice, sweet are they."
33,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great location overlooking the park and the museum's. Big glass windows, feels very outdoorsy. Has outdoor seating as well. Good coffee and beer options. Mid ratings on the service. Great to just chill in between museum trips. Has restroom …"
34,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food is ok but not great. I got the burger with fries. Fries were good but I could tell they had been sitting under a heated lamp. The bathroom costs 50 cents and is coins only. I didn't have cash and they told me to go to the ATM. Given I had just dined there that was a very unpleasant surprise.
35,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good service, great food, portions are perfect."
36,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"It's a good place to have a quick drink after an afternoon in a museum. They had a surprisingly good wild boar hot dog and a nice mulled wine. Service is quick, but the place itself is just not very interesting. Very busy with tourists and the ambiance is nothing special. A bit expensive as well"
37,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Onlu popped in the have a coffee. But the food looked pretty impressive. Very busy, due to its location. Friendly staff that were helpful regarding money to use the toilets. Location is great if your down looking at all the museums."
38,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Perfect place to eat near the museums. Great staff and location, nice food."
39,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The staff are really friendly and the menu is cool. The interior of the shop is really cozy and lovely to stay in. The restrooms were very clean. Its proximity to all museums is a plus !
40,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent, nice Staff, the best mulled wine"
41,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice location, right by the rijks museum.  Menu has some nice dishes, quite international with some Dutch dishes.  Staff was friendly and helpful, plenty of outdoor seating so it's best for a sunny day.  Nice place for a bite and a drink."
42,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good service, good smoked cheese sandwich, and mozzarella panini.  As they brought coffee and Poffertjes before meal had to ask them to warm them up, but was no problem.  Would return."
43,Cobra Caf√©, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"A perfect location with a very poor service. Young waiters, probably temporary workers, are always in trouble with the demands.
Be calm, enjoy the view of the square and wait for your beer.
It will delay..."
44,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good place to have lunch and its near van gogh museum..
45,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,6 years ago,I have to say this is probably my favourite place in the city to sit and have a drink (which is a HUGE compliment because there are lots of places that I love). The outside seating area is brilliant and on a sunny day there is nowhere …
46,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I didn't expect much from a busy cafe right next to Amsterdam's #1 tourist attraction but I was very impressed by the huge slice of fresh, homemade carrot cake (really homemade, by one of the bar staff) and the double macchiato I had was …"
47,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,3 years ago,This place isn’t very friendly. Maybe it’s because we didn’t order alcohol or didn’t eat any fancy meal or because we are just tourists not local dutch people. The waitress hit our glasses roughly on table. That’s was very an unnecessary …
48,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Stopped for a drink and bar snacks. Generous  portions. Helpful and jolly staff. Not expensive bearing in mind it is in a tourist trap. We had bittenballen and indonesian cheese spring rolls. 16 large pieces.
49,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place, lovely service but a bit pricey. Terrible aspect is you are expected to pay 1Euro to use the restroom. so if you are going there for drinks get ready to pay each time you have to go"
50,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great toasties and friendly and attention staff!
51,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Staff was friendly but seemed distracted at times. The food was nice and cheap but there were very little options. The decor in the place was terrible, very little atmosphere."
52,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Unfriendly service,dirty tables, dirty glasses beside this as a customer have to pay for a toilet and getting a ticket later. Then they taking off from the bill ok.. but this toilet is for everyone who has nothing to do with the cafe too …"
53,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,a year ago,Good place for simple snacks and short lunch before you re heading to museums around. Definitely recommend
54,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic location on Museum Square overlooking a playground and the I Amsterdam statue. Food is very mediocre and expensive. And even paying customers have to spend .50 Euro to use the bathroom (which is pretty cool but still).
55,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Mid 2015 (July), the service was friendly and attentive. We had an apple pie, small pancakes (pofferties) and muesli with fresh fruits. All was very tasty. …"
56,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Staff are extremely rude, we sat on a 4 seat table and there was only 2 of us, a member off staff came over after about 5/10 minutes and asked us to move because we were taking up too much room, he was very rude. Another female member of …"
57,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Been there for the 4th time. Always have been nicely treated till today. Unfriendly manager always pushing the staff, people asked to move in order to free up some chairs, not so ealthy menu offer.  Not happy at all. Don't feel like coming back."
58,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly staff great service. Definitely try the hotdog 😁 gets really busy because of the location. Very reasonably priced. Well worth a visit
59,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"MUST. TRY. POFFERTJES!!!

If anyone tells you that Amsterdam isn’t known for any of their food, then don’t …"
60,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Appalling place. Went with two friends today. Asked for one Pepsi, one Fanta and one Spa. They brought the ""pepsi"" and ""fanta"" already served in glasses, i.e., no can, no bottle. Two glasses of flat, not cold liquid, at 3 Euros per glass. …"
61,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Good food. Asked for tap water and apparently they don't do that anymore. What every that means! I thought under law if you sold alcohol you had to offer tap water. Food was well priced considering the location. Would reccomend if you were around the area.
62,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,4 years ago,I have been to this place a few times. Yesterday was the worst and last time though. I was refused to buy a bottle of water because according to two people of the stuff: we are closed! It was 18.25 a good half hour actually before official …
63,Cobra Caf√©, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is ok but the service was one deception after the other one. They even made us change table because it was easier for them if we were sitting outside. (Be sure to bring coins, you have to pay for the toilets)"
64,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Nice selection of good food fast service
65,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,7 years ago,"Sadly we came when it was busy...and watched 3 other tables get service whilst we had to struggle to get a waiter over: in fact I had to go up to the bar to ask for a menu, then to place an order, then go to the bar again to ask for the …"
66,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Very nice place on edge of square sandwich was very tasty
67,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious burgers and gigantic fries portion. Definitely recommend.  But you can visit toilet only once for free. That is not good
68,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,a year ago,We wanted a quick snack because we were on a tight schedule and they didn’t make us wait at all!
69,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Location is definitely the biggest thing this cafe has going for it. Service is quite slow, but pretty friendly. Prices are okay (taking into account the touristy location..) There's a kids' playground and the IAMSTERDAM-sign right next to the building."
70,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lost my wallet in this place and the owner returned it to me like a gentleman. Called a few contacts to get to me. Can't say anything bad about the Cobra. Thankyou very much.
71,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The sign board says Polite but once you go in, the staff are just the opposite. Rude and abhorrent. Good luck trying to even just use their so called “public” toilets."
72,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Friendly staff. The hot chocolate with rum was great. But be careful if you are driving. Overall a great place to come for a winter drink
73,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent food and decent service but high prices. You are paying for the location, not the food. Not that that's a problem it is a lovely area"
74,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice cafe modern bright airy place. Service quite good. Nice coffee with a free pastry of some sort.
75,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was OK, but the commotion and loud atmosphere makes this a stressful eating experience. You'll need a Valium afterward."
76,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had a very nice breakfast and relaxed outside on a beautiful day. Service was a little overwhelmed with the amount of customer's.
77,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Since there is almost nothing around it its the only option if you want to snack around the museums....Not cheap...service is polite but kitchen takes time to deliver....Good views outside but not really interesting place..
78,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's fine. Food is good, and great location. But very much on the pricey side"
79,Cobra Caf√©, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The dish was ok, but the service was terrible. Rather walk to jordaan or de pijp and you will find plenty of good places. Not worth your money and time."
80,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Busy place, we had a burger and tuna salad, both tasty. Be prepared to wait, lots of museum customers"

84,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Ordered 2 beers, waited 20minutes, when i asked for the beers he said they are closing and the bar goit cleaned and we can't get the beers anymore. What a waste of time. Horrible service."
85,Cobra Caf√©, 2 stars ,3 years ago,We had to wait 20 minutes till we could order- and it was not extremly full. After that we had to wait 15 minutes for two cups of Tea.
86,Cobra Caf√©, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Quite a nice place but it lost a few stars because the toilet costs one extra euro even for paying customers, food and drinks delivery was quite slow and service wasn't too pleasant."
87,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Heineken tent right by the Rijks! The view outside is less claustrophobic since they removed the 'iamsterdam' from the premises!
88,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Limited menu, simple food that tastes good. Great location, service was a bit slow because it was busy"
89,Cobra Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best Burger I have ever had. I advise this restaurant for people visiting Amsterdam. Friendly staff as well.

91,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good Café near the I AMSTERDAM sign. The servers were nice and I tried the ""Cobra Coffee"", which is a little pricey but very tasty too."
92,Cobra Caf√©, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Just not very friendly. Maybe we were too old and not cool enough. Arancini were nice but not going back

103,Cobra Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic location and friendly staff.
104,Cobra Caf√©, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Very slow inattentive service. They also made a mistake on my order. Chicken sandwich consists of cold cuts. Not recommended.

107,Cobra Caf√©, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This cafe only looks for your money. I asked to refill some water for my tea, the waitress refused me. It’s terrible, because it’s a waste of money. I’m just asking for some hot water dude.👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
