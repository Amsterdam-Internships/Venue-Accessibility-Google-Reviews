0,Caffe Italia, 4 stars ,a week ago,"Went here spontaneously because my first impression was that it looked like a cosy place. I ordered the Pizza Di Luca and I'm very happy about my order. Pizza's are pretty big, but not so filling and for me that's good because I'm not a big ‚Ä¶"
1,Caffe Italia, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,After an landing in the early morning in Amsterdam. We were looking for a place to have a breakfast and found this small restaurant. I ordered a wrap and a croissant with egg and ham. It was so delicious. The orange juice were fresh made ‚Ä¶

9,Caffe Italia, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I ordered Spaghetti Carbonara, it was a very small amount and did not taste that well. They mixed pesto into it which was pretty weird. The ‚Äúparmiggiano‚Äù came in a very cheap looking container, was expired and not it was not even real ‚Ä¶"
10,Caffe Italia, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food. Excellent service. You should Try the Gorgonzola pasta.

18,Caffe Italia, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Was there for Dinner. Restaurant was still crowded at 11 pm. Nevertheless staff was still really friendly. I ve had soup and pasta, both was really delicious and everything seemed to be fresh and homemade. Prices were average for the area, quality of food and atmosphere in the restaurant better than average in the area  :)"
19,Caffe Italia, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Went there on a Wednesday afternoon. As soon as we stepped in no one wanted to greet us and when finally the waitress arrived she was impolite and rude... it is hard to feel yourself comfortable in a situation and a place like this... it is ‚Ä¶
20,Caffe Italia, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Really great food! Pasta was very nice. My girlfriend has a gluten allergy and the menu did not cater much for her (hence the dropped star). She had a chicken salad which she said was very nice. The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was very good value.
21,Caffe Italia, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Unfortunately this is not a place where you will find real italian food. Italian dishes are sooo bad, that I ate american bbq ribs. Minestrone was terrible. Pizza was below the average. The best about the place was the service. They managed ‚Ä¶"

23,Caffe Italia, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Fairly good food, though not unique or out of the world."
24,Caffe Italia, 3 stars ,3 years ago,So first it started with them refusing to serve me a glass of tap water (even though ordered food and wine). The pasta were very good but the desert (the coulant) was clearly just a microwave thing and the chocolate was not even melting ‚Ä¶
25,Caffe Italia, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food is good but they pretend to not serve tap water so they can make you pay for their bottles. My dinner partner saw the bartender pour half a glass of water from the bar's tap yet they refuse to serve tap water to patrons.
26,Caffe Italia, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The pasta was great and the garlic butter was very tasty. Would have been a much better experience if the waiter hadn‚Äôt told the couple next to us that serving tap water is illegal in Amsterdam... what a stupid lie. Overcharging is something you have to accept as a tourist but no need to lie.

Waitress always has a smile.
