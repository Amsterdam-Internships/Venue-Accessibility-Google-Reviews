0,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"We had the lamb harissa and beef nacho hot dogs, with a side of fries with rocket and truffle mayo. Absolutely delicious. Fries were good portion, but if you‚Äôre hungry, maybe get two hot dogs per person as they‚Äôre a bit smaller than normal ‚Ä¶"
1,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Hot dogs in my opinion 2,5/5* for 9e it was small sausage little bit cold, good toppings
Fries 5/5* tasty and big portion. ‚Ä¶"
2,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Great taste and flavour of the homemade hotdogs. Can be the best in town with different sausages variations, beers from Two Chefs Brewing and some great milkshakes. Size does matter sometimes! A great combination of sausage, sauces and ‚Ä¶"
3,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"I recommend! Nice hotdogs but milkshake was absolutely outstanding ‚ù§Ô∏è
Staff was helpful and kind."
4,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Loved this experience. Never had this yummy onion rings. WOW! Hot dog & beer combo perfect fitting in style & taste.
5,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Very nice place, nice staff and worth the short walk to get there! Not sure if I would describe the German weiner as a typical German, but it was delicious anyways! Especially the combo of the pretzel bun, sauce and kraut! I would definitely come back."
6,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The flavors that end up on your pallet are well chosen and will result in you having a delicious meal. The side dishes are of a generous portion and the packaging is easy on the eyes. I genuinely recommend trying out these hot dogs, since ‚Ä¶"

We had a classic and Texan style (front) hotdog, which were very good and not ‚Ä¶"
8,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,An interesting take on hot dogs. They were tasty and extremely presentable (read: Instagrammable) but also quite difficult to eat. ‚Ä¶
9,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,7 months ago,This place must be checked! Delicious food. Quality/price is excellent. Chill vibes and very nice staff ü§ó
10,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Not bad, but not great either.
The service is okay, the food is okay, but nothing outstanding. ‚Ä¶"
11,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"HUGE milkshakes, and they are really good. They have decent prices on the appetizers and everything else they sell, but the milkshakes are around ‚Ç¨7. The place is a little dirty, but it has a cool vibe. Worth checking out for sure."
12,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is the place to be! Its very hip so it attracts a lot of youngsters and the food is from amazing quality. I have tried 5 different hotdogs now at this place and it never went wrong. Even the vegan hotdog is worth the try (its ‚Ä¶
13,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Banana milkshake was delicious and presentation was fantastic. Great ambiance and lovely staff. Definitely worth the trip should you be thinking of visiting. Will defo come back when next I‚Äôm in Amsterdam
14,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,a year ago,I like this restaurant a lot. Especially the milkshake and the curly fries. The food tastes great and the portions are big. Both the delivery and offline experience are great! I recommend it.
15,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good... For Instagram posts. The hotdogs were good but small, the sausage was more like a thin (although really tasty) chipolata. We also had a freak shake which was impressive when it came, and was tasty. All in all I'm saying okay because I don't think I'd go back, I didn't really blow me away. Good service."
16,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy place with big variety of hot dogs, sides and amazing milkshakes.
Great for a small snack or a full meal
I just loved everything about it. Don't miss it on your next trip to Amsterdam"
17,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I really liked the food here! The hotdog in the picture was the Bacon and chips dog which costs ‚Ç¨7. It was soooooo delicious!! I will for sure be returning here to try out the rest of the menu. The banger burger was funny because the patty ‚Ä¶
18,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Saw this as a part of a Buzzfeed recommendation so thought I would try and half to say it wasn't bad. The highlight was the milkshakes for me they were mad and crazy (in a good way), sugar heaven honestly they tasted amazing. The hotdogs ‚Ä¶"
19,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very impressed with our visit to Bulls and Dogs. The place has a great personality, and their theme is baked into the entire restaurant. We ordered a burger each with curly fries to share with a pink lemonade and a milkshake. The burgers ‚Ä¶"
20,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 months ago,A nice place.  The staff was helpful and the food was delicious: hot dogs and milkshake for dessert.  The decor was nice.  Has some few board games.
21,Bulls and dogs, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Unfortunately we were really disappointed. My girlfriend and I took the chicken hotdog which was really pricey and didn't really taste like hotdog but more like just normal minced chicken sausage. ‚Ä¶
22,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I loved the atmosphere, great choice of colour palate and decor. Music went well with the vibes. It‚Äôs a chillaxing place for lunch/dinner. You can grab a great selection of food and hangout. Ordered kiwi happiness freakshake, Coney Island ‚Ä¶"
23,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A cozy place for winter! The hot chocolate as well as the milkshakes were stunning and delicious!! However the hot dog was a great disappointment. It definitely didn't deserve its money. I'll definitely go there again for a hot chocolate.
24,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Went in for lunch on a Friday. Had the dogs before in the location Foodhallen, but not visited this location yet. Went for the shakes, which are amazing. ‚Ä¶"
25,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It is incredible to think that a simple Christmas gift started such a great business.
Today we went to have dinner here. The food tasted great, and was a good amount! ‚Ä¶"
26,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Bulls and dogs are marketing geniuses. The food looks much more delicious  than it actually is. Heavy tourist traffic, not a local place. Decent food, decent prices."
27,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I've order a delux hotdog and pistacho milkshake. Both are delicious. The hotdog was a bit too pricy because the dog is pretty small. The milkshakes are totally worth it. Please visit. It's worth the while.
28,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"HELLO FOODIESü§™
Today i was at @bullsanddogs its a nice caf√© in Amsterdam, i had a hotdogüå≠ and Some twister Friesüçü.for the price, taste, and portion. ‚Ä¶"
29,Bulls and dogs, 1 star ,6 months ago,Food is always great but unfortunately all of us got a food poisoning 2 times in a row after eating here. My sister missed her flight the next day because she was sick. Wont visit again such a shame
30,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food with unique hotdog and hamburger dishes. An order of fries are very generous and you can choose a topping.
31,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The food here is AMAZING, the reviews do not dissapoint. The portions are great and the service is very friendly. They have a couple promotions and if you miss them on the menu they‚Äôll let you know, which doesn‚Äôt often happen in most restaurants."
32,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Milkshakes are excellent, the Dutch Wookie Cookie has a much better consistency. The loaded fries are excellent as well and cut down the sweetness of the shakes. Must try while you are in Amsterdam."
33,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Went to the FoodHallen installation of bulls and dogs twice this week. Went once and it was fantastic! However, on my second trip I only ordered the onion rings and got this...totally inedible. And to top it all off, I had to wait 25 ‚Ä¶"
34,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,a year ago,Lovely place!!! We had 2 burgers and a milkshake afterwards. Both damm good! We also ended up having a conversation with the manager who was very nice and friendly. Definitely coming back!
35,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice concept, quick & easy stop to grab some food and drink, but.... sausages too tiny (where was the meat?!), not a very special salad and average sides. Dusty floor didn't help to get 4 stars."
36,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It's not cheap but it's good. So you know the price when you go there so you've accepted that. Then all you need is the food to be good and it is. I had the bacon dog and Mac and cheese waffles
37,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Place is small and dark. Seats are uncomfortable. We waited for our order quiet long. Food was tasting okay, both bread and fries were extremely crispy, my scratched gums didn't appreciate it at all. Overall it's an average trendy experience, nothing special."
38,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,8 months ago,The greatest place for best milk shakes and hotdogs in Amsterdam ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©
39,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Yummy dogs, curly fries and  amazing milkshakes! Hip and interesting. The space is tight, so try not to bring stroller inside, but otherwise very kid friendly! I enjoyed the free fruit water too."
40,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The milkshakes are sooooo good..... I would fky to Amsterdam solely to get another one of them! Sweet potato chips with bacon and cheese were amazing too x
41,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good Hot dogs, fries and onion rings. It is a little bit overpriced and understaffed, service was too slow. However, I would go there again. Give it a try when you're in Amsterdam. Especially if you like to take food pictures for Instagram..."
42,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good hot dogs, the bread was quite hard to bite but they were very good flavoured. However... we waited around 35-45 minutes for our order (after request it)... probably they forgot our order that day."
43,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Well priced and tasty food full of flavor. Small restaurant with a nice vibe. Would highly recommend even if it is a bit of a walk from the major hotels.
44,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Fine food, not eccentric, but you wouldn't expect that from a place with a name like this, right?! RIGHT? The milkshakes are freakshows, which is good in this context. Friendly staff, dims the light if you ask them üòé"
45,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I accidentally gave this restaurant 4 stars I'm sorry I messed up it's my fault. This place is a 10 out of 5 stars. Thank you for a great introduction to Amsterdam restaurants.
46,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Visited amsterdam for 15 days and we came back to eat here 3 times during the trip the shakes are beautiful and the hot dogs were phenomenal. I can't wait to go back!
47,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very cool place with amazing milkshakes and a large variety of creative Hot Dogs in a delicious pretzel bun.
48,Bulls and dogs, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Cocktail was very tasty, great idea! But the rest absolutely not (dogs and fried potatoes). Moreover, the cook was super dirty."
49,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Vegetarian option is not really good, but all milkshakes are delicious we will cama back to try a new, they're huge, almost like a meal itself, but worth to try them all."
50,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Absolutely amazing food and drink, lovely setting inside and amazing staff! Couldn't recommend enough!!"
51,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great place, great food and service.
The curly fries and milkshakes are amazing"
52,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The crazy sweet millshakes were actually better than hot dogs, but maybe we haven‚Äôt chosen the best option. Anyways good food and friendly staff, so recommended"
53,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The hot dogs here are heavenly and the shakes are not only beautiful but also decadent. Highly recommend. Only in Amsterdam for three days but we might go back...
54,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Decorative hotdogs and delicious milkshakes. Conveniently located near the Heineken experience. The parmesan cheese fries are also quite tasty
55,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food was amazing but having to queue outside was a bit of a let down. It may need more staff as only two girls were on and were ran off their feet.
56,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing shakes !!! This place has a low key vibe with amazing shakes. So decadent and dreamy. Pictured is the Dutch Cookie Wookie and it was incredible. Heads up they only take cards NO cash
57,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cute restaurant with tasty food and friendly staff. Very busy on a Tuesday night, so probably full on other days as well. Value is great, too."
58,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, wonderful relaxed vibe. Great after walking around the city. Staff was fun!"
59,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I had no idea a hot dog should be life changing ... but at Bulls & Dogs that is just what happened. Words cannot describe how I feel about these hot dogs -- just take my word for it ... GO!
60,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Place is tight. Hotdog bun/bread was a bit hard. You can only pay in credit card (not that it‚Äôs a demerit)
61,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my fav places ever, always so happy to go, cozy atmosphere, lovely staff, boomboom! food!!"
62,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,8 months ago,bustin bustin! i ordered the bourbon bbq hotdog and it was delicious! a side of sweet potato fries with spicy mayo and parmesan cheese was really fitting to go along with it! the chocolate chip cookie milkshake was the perfect sweet ‚Ä¶
63,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and friendly staff, but a bit of a wait when it's busy."
64,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Hot dogs not that good; milkshakes really good.
65,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food was good. Service was pretty slow. Also tables were so small but they served on giant wood slabs.
66,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Rather cheap considering the quality and presentation of the food was very premium. Tourist friendly. Although its rather small so expect a waiting time, but worth it! Have to order a milkshake!"
67,Bulls and dogs, 2 stars ,11 months ago,"Had the cheeseburger with bacon, bacon was nowhere to be seen, burger was cooked through. It was like trying to swallow down roof paning. Would not recommend. Curling fries were good though."
68,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good hotdogs and perfect milkshakes! And be prepared for waiting for the table - its really small in there!
69,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Super cool fitout. Bit overpriced and the sausage not as smoky as I would have liked. Decent for a visit though. Woof woof!!
70,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Insanely good hot dogs and milk shakes. Each one is extravagant and well-made with creative and delicious options. I will be back!
71,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful hot dog's place, food so tasty and lovely staff. There is not cheap, something like regular prices in Amsterdam, is not fast food"
72,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,a year ago,Delicious hot dogs and milkshakes. I've never eaten such a good hot dog as here. But service could be better. There were four of us and two of us get their food when the other two were ready eating.
73,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The best hot dog!!
74,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The milkshake is awesome the hot dog like one of the best hot dog that I ever had in my life, perfect combination of savory and magnificent sweet ending üòã"
75,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Atmosphere-4, Food-5, Service-4

76,Bulls and dogs, 1 star ,a year ago,Wanted to love this place. Saw good and so-so reviews. Went mid-Saturday afternoon. One other couple there. Service rather slow and very inattentive. We ordered fries and onion rings. I think we received two orders of onion rings in one ‚Ä¶
77,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Hot dogs are superb, 100% recommended. Shakes were not the big thing. It was okay but, I still don't try a milkshake with that sort of aggressive decoration that lives to match its flavor with that. ‚Ä¶"
78,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best hot dogs I've ever had, hands down! I'd love to come back and try the rest of the menu but unfortunately I've got to leave Amsterdam. The food is very reasonably priced and the milkshakes are another specialty here. So many ‚Ä¶"
79,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place. Not that crowded but has delicious burgers. Especially the curly fries were great. If you're nearby and hungry I would recommend this place. The only downside is that it was a little bit more expensive when compared to other burger joints in Amsterdam.
80,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Hottest Hot Dogs in town. Great both for take away and on the spot.
Higly reccomended. Enjoy"
81,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We went to the bull and dogs in foodhallen. It‚Äôs a popular booth for sure. It‚Äôs unique and flavorful!
82,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Crazy menu and amazing service! Must try
83,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"However, there was a queue outside.. we had to wait about 10 mins for table.. food was delicious but tables are quite small to serve such a large plates of food"
84,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The vegan hot dog was super! The sauce and extras were very tasty.
The place is very hip, and totally not what I was expecting from a hot dog place. ‚Ä¶"
85,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I got the classic hot dog but I didn't like the bun, it was a hard brioche bun. I'm not used to that combination so it was different for me. The loaded fries were great though! They also had massive milkshakes on the menu and my friend loved that."
86,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing hotdogs and milkshakes. But be careful both my boys insisted they could drink a whole one but they really couldnt!
87,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Not bad, but not very tasty. Really nice waitress"
88,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A twist on a normal hotdog. The service was different than American they were way less attentive. Food was good and the milkshakes looked amazing but I didn't have one. I would give it a try and fries were delicious!!
89,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service, great atmosphere. Would definitely come again for a shake."
90,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Hotdogs were great! Milkshakes were kind of awful. They are only ""insta worthy"" but lack taste. The red velvet milkshake had lemon curd and strawberry syrup. Not sure how that's red velvet. The milkshake was not sweet or flavoured enough ‚Ä¶"
91,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Highly reccomend this place! Their hot dogs and fries are great, but the milkshakes even though they look spectacular they taste somewhat above average! Very cozy place with normal prices ( compared to the local prices)"
92,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place! It looks great, delicious milkshakes and the hot dogs are superb. Its not that pricey for its location and should really be a go to if you like hotdogs. I definitely enjoyed my stay. The service was excellent!"
93,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"nice place with nice atmosphere. the food is good, not much to be wrong with a hotdog."
94,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,a month ago,Best milkshakes and the place is cozy
95,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,2 years ago,There's a lot of hype surrounding this restaurant because of its feature on Insider so you'll be surrounded by a lot of tourists when you visit. ‚Ä¶
96,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fattest milkshake ever, but totally worth trying!"
97,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It's a really nice restaurant
Nice decoration and well located not too far from tram station.
However, it's a small space and it tends to be full fast ‚Ä¶"
98,Bulls and dogs, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"If an American Burger is what you are looking for, this inst the place. Don't get me wrong the food is okay but it wasn't a good burger. Their shakes looked really good but we didn't have one. A proper burger should not be seasoned, just salt and a little black pepper."
99,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The combination of milkshake and dogs is awesome.
100,Bulls and dogs, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Tried onion rings, Texas dog and the cheeseburger. Onion rings were not onion rings, they were a random set of onion pieced not even fried properly.
In the hot dog I got a wooden skewer! The dog was not very tasty. The only positive part about the meal was the cheese on cheeseburger."
101,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Was pretty good overall. The staff were lovely! The burger was really nice. The hotdogs all come with cabbage on them which is not mentioned anywhere on the menu and really spoils them. ‚Ä¶
102,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Apart from the 40 minutes wait for two dogs, the dogs were not good at all. They look nice on the plate but the bread is too hard, sausages too small and sauces too bland. ‚Ä¶"
103,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Well priced but fairly unexceptional food. Cozy atmosphere although difficult table to eat from where we were sat.
104,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome food and  great experience!
105,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Hotdogs are amazingly tasty. They have picturesque milkshakes which were a bit too sweet for me, however, it was still good. Just be careful, the restaurant is so small so that you may need to make a queue to get in."
106,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food, nice Shakes - basicly quite okay. But the girl forgot one of our orders even two times, we were waiting for ages. But after the boy started his shift we at least got our choclate-shake and he made the rest up to us by giving us the fries for free."
107,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Don't go here if you're a) on a diet b) counting calories c) sugar shy.  The hot dogs are really fantastic as are the fries. Not super big portions. People had milkshakes that looked like heart attacks in pretty mason jars. I didn't have ‚Ä¶
108,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The hot dogs and milkshakes are very delicious. Staff is friendly, however the tables and menus could be cleaned better and they could be more attentive."
109,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A great cosy place with awesome burgers, good coffee and amazing milkshakes.
Enjoy the friendly service when eating-in. Either eating-in or takeaway, it‚Äôs a great stop to boost your energy when exploring Amsterdam!"
110,Bulls and dogs, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Me and my husband, we ate at Bulls and Dogs on November 30. We had a Luxurious Dog, a Funky fresh dog, fries, a beer and a cup of tea.
In the Luxurious dog I found a big piece of plastic, triangular in shape with 3 ‚Ä¶"
111,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best hot dogs in town!!!!! It‚Äôs been years since I had hot dogs this GOOD!!! Staff were really nice and friendly. They have an awesome selection of hot dogs and the sausages seem to be made from scratch. What an amazing little spot.
112,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Came for a milkshake only.

Must say was delicious yet still disappointing and way over priced. Milkshakes ‚Ä¶"
113,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,a year ago,It's a cosy little place. Good hidden spot to hang out. You can play boardgames too. Sadly they are incomplete. So thats one star off the rating. The food is obviously really good. Pleasing to the eye even better for the stomach.
114,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The funky fresh dog is so good. I‚Äôve probably had 50 of them this past year. I also get the curly fries and Mac and cheese. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the corn. The first time I had it at Foodhallen it was delicious, but here it was missing ingredients and soggy."
115,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing hot dogs and freakshakes!
116,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Fries and hotdogs were quite good and creative flavor-wise.
The food was served quickly.  However the place is quite small and not very comfortable if you're sitting on the windows."
117,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We loved this place.  My fiance is a vegetarian and it was so great they had a meat substitute.  It was delicious food, fun choices and the milkshake we tried was one of the best I've ever had"
118,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love this place! Unique flavored hot dogs with great sides! They also have freakshakes, which you can add shots of alcohol to, which naturally is totally the way to go üòÉ  i highly recommend the onion rings and corn (not sure it's called elote on the menu but that's what it is)."
119,Bulls and dogs, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Lowish quality. The menu looks awesome but I didn't enjoy it at all, neither the hot dog (almost raw bacon!) nor the fries (poor quality and quantity in the sauce; overburnt) nor the smoothie (which is actually low quality ice-cream with Nutella and cream). Plus, the commercial loud music makes it uncomfortable."
120,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Hot dogs are delicious and their pretzel buns are fantastic. Do not leave without getting one of their insane milkshake. You will feel ashamed of yourself after eating it, but it is so worth it."
121,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Got dogs taken to the next level, awesome smoothies."
122,Bulls and dogs, 1 star ,2 years ago,Was really looking forward to a smashing hot dog and shake. Hot dog was a solid 1/10. Felt like i ate a child's plastic model. Shake was okay 5/10. Not angry. Just disappointed...
123,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place has a lot of hype and it lives up to it, and was less expensive than expected. Everyone in the place seemed to be a tourist, including me - likely due to its trendiness. Can‚Äôt really fault this place anywhere, although it was ‚Ä¶"
124,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Dirty, but in a good way. Uploading these pictures are making my mouth water."
125,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I recently discovered Bulls and Dogs over Facebook after their ‚ÄòStroopwafel‚Äô (Dutch Syrup Waffle) Milkshake which looked amazing, went viral, and it at once became a gem I wanted to visit in Amsterdam. And after doing a bit of reading on ‚Ä¶"
126,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Place is way overhyped by people who find it more important how there food looks on instagram then how it tastes. Hotdogs where ok although the hotdog was very very thin. The milkshake looks amazing but under al the decorations is a very ‚Ä¶
127,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"BEYOND WHAT I EXPECTED!!

The restaurant is beautiful, the staff and owner are amazingly friendly and ‚Ä¶"
128,Bulls and dogs, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"It took 1 hour(!!!!) for the food (3 hot dogs and 2 sides) to arrive. They didn‚Äôt tell us that it may take this long. People in the restaurant actually went to the staff to pay the bill instead of asking them for it, because the service was ‚Ä¶"
129,Bulls and dogs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is OK, good,  but I would say nothing special and a bit costly in general, like everywhere  here . It looks much bigger on the add than it's actual size. Very small beers though.  Normal one is a 1/4 of a pint or similar size to a couple  of shots. Service is quite good and quick."
130,Bulls and dogs, 1 star ,2 years ago,Doesn't say on menu that salad is included with absolutely everything so couldn't eat any of it. Gave us mayonnaise when we ordered them without so ended up just eating the hotdog and picking at chips. Terribly small and awful vibes.
131,Bulls and dogs, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Purchased a lamb hot dog from the Foodhall in Amsterdam, not this actual store. The food store looks amazing and was very busy! Service wasn't the best as the cashier did not acknowledge me waiting with money in hand, staring straight at ‚Ä¶"
132,Bulls and dogs, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ordered sweet fries + Parmesan cheese/spicy mayo .... got classic French fries with feta /garlic.... good hotdogs, but nothing special; decent milkshakes. Couldn‚Äôt pay by card so should walk over to atm. Overall overhyped place."
133,Bulls and dogs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"God bless the arrogant jerk who dreamt up this gourmet hot dogs concept. My preference goes to the sample platter with five different dogs, so you can delight in the diversity of flavors. The real secret, I think is the obnoxiously crunchy ‚Ä¶"
134,Bulls and dogs, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Ok food, bun for the dogs should be a little bit bigger to help contain all the ingredients"
