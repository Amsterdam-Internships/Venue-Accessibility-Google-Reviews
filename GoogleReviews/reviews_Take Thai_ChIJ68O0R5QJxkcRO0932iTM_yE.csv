1,Take Thai, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,We found this place by mistake when my planned gluten free find had closed! It was so great. In a fun downtown area with bars or walking for after. The Thai was amazing and authentic. Most of the menu can be gluten free. So great!!!
2,Take Thai, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing place with lovely staff!
The food is out of this world.
We tried the stir fried noodles which were simply phenomenal."
3,Take Thai, 5 stars ,7 months ago,So.... new location but same fabulous team. The food remains amazing! Top Thai in Amsterdam .. yes it’s not the most glamour location ... but.. it’s a huge terrace and the inside is so cozy and authentic. Duck in red curry 150%!
4,Take Thai, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place has awfully tasty Thai dishes on offer and I've been there several times. Super friendly service and an informal but nice white interior makes this a great place to enjoy dinner with friends or partner.

13,Take Thai, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Pleasant surroundings and very attentive and friendly staff. Food very good - beef with Thai basil was outstanding. Only minor criticism was the fact that a couple of the dishes were a little too heavy on the fish sauce. But overall a great experience. Recommended.
