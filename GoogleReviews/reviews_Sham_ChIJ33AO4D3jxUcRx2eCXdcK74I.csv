55,Sham, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Hidden gem in Amsterdam West. Excellent food. Too much to eat. The Maqluba with lamb meat is delicious. As a starter I would strongly recommend the Hummus.

67,Sham, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I ordered a lamb dish that was more in the form of a thin piece of lamb steak than kebob form with potato wedges covered in a creamy white sauce.  To me it snuffed out the lamb meat flavor.  Id recommend trying kebob or possibly a lamb dish without the sauce if you are a big lamb person like me.
