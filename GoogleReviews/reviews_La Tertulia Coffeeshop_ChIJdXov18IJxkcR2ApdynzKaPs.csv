9,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice place,cool location but horrible and disgusting iced coffee. No replacement for it. I got an espresso after it and wasn't any better. Again perfect location, nice spot but....."
10,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Prettiest coffeeshop in town. Nice selection of good weed, good drinks, relaxed atmosphere. The only downside is that they close at 7pm."

13,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Interesting experience. They style this place like a mad scientist/laboratory/pharmacy.  This was recommended by a guide on the tour of the city we took. …
14,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love this place! Friendly staff (who remembered us!), excellent coffee, nice atmosphere, can't really fault it! It doesn't have an overly tourist vibe either, which adds to the experience."

16,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It was my absolute favourite coffee shop in Amsterdam. If you love a chill relaxing environment to smoke in I highly recommend la tertulia, the staff and selection of Cannabis are wonderful. If you like a more club like atmosphere I don’t …"
17,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This shop is the nicest shop to stay in that I have visited so far in Amsterdam. There is a  naturally and brightly lit indoor terrace, with seats to sip tea, read, or chat with friends. There is outdoor seating as well. I can't review the bus since I didn't buy any here, but I plan to return to find out and relax and such a cool spot."
18,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Our favourite coffee shop in Amsterdam and we've tried nearly all of them. Its beautiful outside right on one of the most beautiful canals in Amsterdam. Its also lovely to sit inside, full of plants and crystals. The staff is always so …"
19,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I like to smoke, but absolutely hate most coffee shops. This place still has the vibe of the coffee shops of my youth. I believe the fact that it's run by ladies is a big factor that sets this place apart from the other's."
20,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,a week ago,Still the best! A personal favorite
21,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Prices are too expensive and it is not such a good place. The orange juice is the WORST I tried EVER. I felt so pressured by the staff to consume drinks, weed and food (ALL OF THEM, it was not enough to grab a drink or some weed). Definitely not coming back."
22,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place, it doesn't feel like a coffe shop but rather a very relaxing reading space. The products are good."
23,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"As the other guy said, the bartender doesn't smile at all but she's so pleasant and sweet... like a film character. I'm in here right now and feel really great! Good orange juice and open space. Plants and lots of light, beautiful!"
24,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great experience for beginners. An actual coffee place, not a dark one"
25,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Heard it was a green and vegetalized coffee shop, might feel deceived on this matter but otherwise it's a pretty cool spot, they have of course different kind of weed and hash but most of all 3 différent sorts of Space cake from beginner to experienced ✌️✌️"
26,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff will make you feel like home. Board games, delicious family hot chocolate, and the owner has some lovely pictures of Brazil to share with you. Ask him!"
27,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"KO! Went to this place as a group of four. Two of us had cakes, one had a waffle and the other just smoked. I don't know if it was because we did not eat a massive lunch before eating the cake/waffle or something like that; but three of us …"
28,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best coffee shop in all of Amsterdam in my opinion. It's small but light & airy with plants in the entrance & large windows. You can play boardgames while enjoying a toasted sandwich. Only catch is that it closes early.
29,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Situated on the corner of Prinsengracht and Oude Looiersstraat, La Tertulia is one of the city's original coffee shops. It takes its name from the Spanish word which translates as ""The Salon"". …"
30,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"They ask you purchase smokes and drinks there; in other words, don't bring your own delights or use them there. There is a bathroom, and the vibe is cool. It seems like an awkward tourist spot but so do most coffeeshops."
31,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,When extinction rebellion are exiled to Amsterdam like climate camp was in 2009...they have to come to this place for their meetings...vegan and vegetarians welcome and needed to smoke good weed. This place comes highly recommended if you are part of the movement of movements.
32,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Light, airy and reasonably quiet coffeeshop. 10/10 would come here again as long as they let us play board games on weekends. Otherwise excellent freshly squeezed orange juice and service."
33,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"So beautiful and unassuming, definitely the nicest coffeeshop I've been to in Amsterdam. Staff are all super friendly, smiley and relaxed, and the music is perfect and not too loud (always a big turnoff). They sell weed, pre-rolled's, and edibles, and freely explain everything. Wish I'd come across it sooner!"
34,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best coffeeshop around town! I love the small but cosy cafe with good quality products. The cakes and drinks were excellent.
35,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"A quiet little coffeeshop outside of the city center.  I've been twice over the last 7 years (2007 and 2010) and it was always a positive experience.  The floor level feels dense with plants and books, similar to a cozy den.  The upper …"
36,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really friendly, chilled out coffee shop. Cool for newbies or old hands"
37,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cozy, casual and happy. Right on the canal and near plenty of public transit, La Tertulia is a perfectly situated coffee shop playing great music with a small but well used layout with plenty of natural light. They offer Tosti sandwiches, …"
38,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Me and my boyfriend arrived to drink a coffee and enjoy our time, sit and talk. And the guy was really rude and said that we need to buy a coffee and weed as weel, but we didn't want. So we fell very uncomfortable and we order a coffee and left. We tried to find a nice place but this one is not on the list anymore."
39,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A great spot for a smoke and a coffee. Really clean with few tables outside right on the edge of an Amsterdam canal. Good collection of weed and brownies.
40,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place. The staff is very kind and cool. Great place to sit and relax either alone or in group. Weed is; whatever, which is good enough for most. But you can bring your own."
41,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Found this place on our last day in town and so happy about it. Bright but cozy with a lovely garden. The woman working there was gentle and kind. What a wonderful place to smoke a j
42,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"So much more chill, delicate and feminine compared to all the other coffeeshops which all seem to have a very broey/laddish vibe - not that that's a bad thing but it's nice to get somewhere thats a bit more tame and has a feminine aesthetic"
43,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff, decent priced goods. There is a lot of seating both indoors and outside. Great fresh squeezed orange juice. Overall good experience."
44,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I really love this coffeeshop, you don't have the typical coffeeshop vibe. Great relaxt atmosphere, lots of plants, and a very nice lady selling the great and often organic herbs to enjoy with a nice coffee and browny or to take away and space out somewhere else in Amsterdam."
45,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Bio hemp coffeeshop, you have to buy weed or Home made Space Brownies to be able to sit and enjoy a drink. The place is cosy and much better that other crowded and dark coffeeshops. Positive vibes."
46,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Lovely ambiance, if you love being surrounded by stones/crystals and positive energy! Tried the Jack Herer and LOVED it. You can also purchase some crystals & some jewlery too. Lots of seating ... definitely worth a visit :)"
47,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"An original design and I loved the vibe inside. People either working or chilling with their SO's. Something different, that's for sure. If you're a woman and feel intimidated by coffeeshops, step in - you won't be here."
48,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,6 months ago,the vegan space cake is very good
49,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very good place to chill and eat milkshake

51,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It is a really calm experience, the weed is strong and is a good mix, is not a place with loud music that can upset you. When i go back this place is on my list."
52,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"The Smokers Guide has always been a fan of La Tertulia. A light and friendly canal-side shop, with a a quality menu. Not too touristy, a bit more relaxed with the crystal garden and split level design. Check out our Google+ page to learn more."
53,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Weed is okay, atmosphere and people great! Closed early though and on mondays, but a great spot to relax with some tea and such nonetheless."
54,La Tertulia Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,11 years ago,"I liked this place a lot. The woman behind the bar didn't smile at all, but she was very friendly. They have a verdamper vaporizer which is great.  I will be back next time I'm around."
