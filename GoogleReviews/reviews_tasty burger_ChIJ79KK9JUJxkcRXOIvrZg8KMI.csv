14,tasty burger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"My burger was absolutely delicious. It had some ""hangover sauce"" on it and it was s solid 1/2 pound burger.

24,tasty burger, 1 star ,4 years ago,Looks like these guys are new at the business. It took me 25 minutes to get my burger and fries with just a few people in the restaurant. I took my order to go only to find when I got home that they forgot the cheese and the bacon.  How hard can it be to make a burger? Apparently very hard for these guys...
