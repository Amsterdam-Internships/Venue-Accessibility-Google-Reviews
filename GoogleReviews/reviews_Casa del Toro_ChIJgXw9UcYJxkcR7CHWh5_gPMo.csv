14,Casa del Toro, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Attentive waiter.  Good service.  One beverage was served in a dirty glass (‚Ç¨3.50, ouch).  The chicken avocado sandwich is not a chicken breast:  it is a ground chicken burger (a somewhat unpleasant surprise), but it was well presented on a tasty bun.  Mayonaisse packet extra charge."

17,Casa del Toro, 2 stars ,9 months ago,The special menu steak was not good. The owner's explanation was it was a good price for 200g. Had much better experience on similar priced menus on the Damrak. 100g of good beef for less than the ‚Ç¨12.95 here. Disappointing

23,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice restaurant around city center. The service was really great, the food came fast and the waiter is always responsive. I ordered a calamari portion, it was 10 rings, great friture crispy and dry. I thought it was a bit expensive (14‚Ç¨), but in general is okay."
24,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Good food with a fair price compared to other restaurants in the center of Amsterdam. what I really liked is that you can have only drinks without the need to order food

27,Casa del Toro, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Poorly cooked chorizo, fairly expensive meat for the quality. Ordered Ancho with mushrooms sauce. Steak came well done (very gray inside), no sauce whatsoever. When I complained, took them 10 minutes to bring a cold, split sauce. Never coming back there again."
28,Casa del Toro, 1 star ,2 years ago,I ate nothing I ordered. The food seems to be made with the cheapest ingredients which is reflected in the taste. Service was adequate but not friendly in the least. Lots of restaurants to choose from here. Skip this one
29,Casa del Toro, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Walking down the street and saw the menus outside on the street with pictures looked very very good, I was so very very wrong. Avoid this restaurant like the plague, worst steak I have ever had in my life, ordered my rib eye medium as it is ‚Ä¶"
30,Casa del Toro, 1 star ,3 years ago,Worst experience and the food was awful. The waiter was totally not attentive and forgot my order a few times even though I pointed at the menu to make sure he understood me. When ordering a steak they don't even ask how you like it to be. ‚Ä¶
31,Casa del Toro, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A quick pizza in a rush. Not that you would expect that from an Argentinean restaurant but for ‚Ç¨5 and the option of takeaway, it was most convenient. If you order takeaway and then change your mind, don't expect to be allowed to stay ‚Ä¶"
32,Casa del Toro, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I wish I had read the reviews before I came here.  We just stumbled across this place and their specials looked good.  The food was awful and overpriced.  The waiter does not listen to you when you talk, he kept getting our order wrong and brought out the wrong food and drinks. The service was very slow, don't waste your time here."
