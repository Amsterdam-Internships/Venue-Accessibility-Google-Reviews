0,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I don't often write reviews but I'm writing this review 3 years after my visit because it's worth remembering! I owe it to the lovely owner and her mother for their delicious meatballs and hospitality. They were so kind and shared stories …
1,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Owner was really friendly, and the food was great too! Tried the stamppot and grandma's meatball combo, as well as the spicy meatball.
Personally really enjoyed the spicy meatball!"
2,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Great food.
Great quality/price.
A bargain"
3,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's difficult to imagine that I would have once rated 5 star a little shack serving meatballs !!
But it REALLY deserves it ! …"
4,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"<FROM KOREA>The owner of this house is very friendly and nice. We had a best meatball here, you order meatball and mashedpotato seperately. Mashed potatoes are also really good, all with reasonable price. They bring beer from the bar beside it."
5,Mister Meatball, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food was great. I had the Grandma's Meatball and the carrot/potato mash. Definitely a hidden gem of Amsterdam with really friendly staff.
6,Mister Meatball, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great place to eat meatballs :) Reasonable price. Very recommended the spicy meatball, although baby balls were a bit too dry for me"
7,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"A beautiful place for taste dutch food (Stampott), kind service and good beers. For repeat. Rep+++++"
8,Mister Meatball, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"A cozy petit restaurant run by attentive cook Merlyn & her sister. They serve tasty handmade boerenkool, zuurkool, hutspot and a meatball, with sju on the Wallen!"
9,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, friendly staff, cheap

10,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Just like it says on the sign: the best in town 👌really enjoyed my lunch at this place, service is excellent!"
11,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I travel to Amsterdam a lot, and have somehow missed this place. The food is simple but yet beautiful. Tender meatballs packed with flavor. The energy from the front of house was lovely and we felt welcome. Love it all!"
12,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely fresh typical Dutch food. Limited room but they also serve food in the pub in the corner (to be frank, the pub terrace is a nicer space to eat). Very reasonable prices and friendly staff. They close at 8:00 pm so be there early to have a nice dinner!"
13,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very small place, OK for a quick bite. Feels like home there."
14,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,3 years ago,OMG! This was one of the best places we ate in Amsterdam! I highly recommend. There is a sweet lady that will explain the menu thoroughly. If there's not enough seating you can sit at her sisters bar with your food 2 doors down.
15,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing staff! They were so kind and friendly. The place is cosy and the food is so tasty. I didn't like meatballs before going to this place, we were hungry and tired so the first place we found to eat was mr meatball, and since then I fell in love with their meatballs."
16,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This spot has delicious traditional Dutch food that is filling. The owner/chef is a wonderful woman from Dutch speaking South America. The conversation was great and I leaned a bit more about the area.
Highly recommended for good food and good people."
17,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Grandma's Meatball and Beetroot Mash was absolutely amazing! The gravy, the meatball were perfection. The mash fantastic as well and she was very accommodating to my wifes dairy allergy. Would definitely go back for more the next time I'm around."
18,Mister Meatball, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food, but they didn't have much variety.
The girl serving was obviously new, as the owner was still explaining to her how to do everything, so that may have delayed our order a little, but the result was very good."
19,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I’m still here - I just finished and I’m in a hurry to let the world know that this was the best meatball I’ve ever had in my life. My Italian ancestors know nothing, the lady running this shop has a secret recipe that should be sent out on the next Voyager probe."
20,Mister Meatball, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious, yummy, homely. If you're looking for a top place to chow down that has a cozy feel, this is your go to place. Located in a convenient location, not far from Amsterdam Centraal, this family run business creates the most succulent …"
