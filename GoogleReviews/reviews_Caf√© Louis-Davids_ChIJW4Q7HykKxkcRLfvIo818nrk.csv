0,Caf√© Louis-Davids, 1 star ,5 months ago,"The owner made us feel uncomfortable from the moment we arrived, sadly he continued throughout our stay until he told my Arabic friend to leave and steal more bikes. We then instantly left and we will never return."

2,Caf√© Louis-Davids, 2 stars ,a year ago,Sadly the service was very poor. We had to wait a long time before we could even order. They didn't have our reservation either. The food was good though. The food is sourced from the restaurants next door so you could decide to skip the long wait for service altogether. The outside seating was nice and did create a cosy atmosphere.

8,Caf√© Louis-Davids, 1 star ,a year ago,"The owner (manager) for a strange reason does not allow you to have a conversation with other people (might be because of skin color) even though you are more than 1.5m apart. That is the standard here, apparently."
