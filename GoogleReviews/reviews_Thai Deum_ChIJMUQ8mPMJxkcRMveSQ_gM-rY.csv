0,Thai Deum, 5 stars ,a month ago,"I’ve been coming here since I just moved to Amsterdam 2,5 years ago. Until today, Thai Deum is still my favourite Thai restaurant in Amsterdam: delicious food for very reasonable prices. Their green curry is unbeatable. I’ll keep on being a loyal customer. See you soon!"
1,Thai Deum, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"We have been eating/ ordering here for the last  11 years. Consistently good authentic food and excellent service. It’s a family run business, with various members all doing their bit behind the open kitchen, but making sure to stop to …"

3,Thai Deum, 4 stars ,4 years ago,I've had dinner here and ordered takeaway numerous times. The food is tasty and reasonably priced with more authentic flavors than what you often encounter in Amsterdam. The interior is a bit old but charming and the atmosphere very …
4,Thai Deum, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Horrible. Portions are a joke for the expensive price you put and the food is no good. Worst part is, when you give feedback the chef gets angry and screams at you. Such a terrible place, should be shut down!"

12,Thai Deum, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Delicious food, with quick and friendly service. A wide and varied menu with plenty of vegetarian options. The decor and ambiance were wonderful as well. The kitchen is open so you can watch the cooks from your table if you would like. We will definitely be coming back."
13,Thai Deum, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Stopped by Saturday at around 8:30pm and it was not very busy. The food was delicious. One of the better pad thais that I've had! We also ordered #162 (don't remember the name, but it is beef with onions, mushrooms, and chilis) and I liked that too. We decided to make this our Go To Thai place."
14,Thai Deum, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good authentic Thai food. We had the tom yam goong and pork green curry, which were nice. The restaurant is a little understaffed though. Takes a bit of time to put your order."
15,Thai Deum, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great homemade Thai food (without MSG!), very kind personnel and great atmosphere."
16,Thai Deum, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Not the best tasting aperitives (fishcakes and prawns) but spring rolls and chicken OK. Duck was ok-ish and pad thai was good. Overall a bit lacking relative to price. Service was nice and friendly and the place cosy.
