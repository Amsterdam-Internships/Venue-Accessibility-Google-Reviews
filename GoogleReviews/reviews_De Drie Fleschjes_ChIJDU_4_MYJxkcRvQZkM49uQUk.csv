4,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really cool and authentic bar which has a lot of choices for genever and local beers. I would recommend trying their tiny cocktails/shots with genever because the drink is very unique.  The bertender was really informative and friendly ! Loved this experience.

11,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very small bar. Cosy. Very limited seating. Historical building.  Lined with century old casks, rented by private families or companies, filled with their favorite concoction. Just for drinks and a small snack. Sip the head off your drink bent over the counter before carrying it away"
12,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful, traditional, historic bar, not to be missed! Very friendly, professional and knowledgeable bartender"

15,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Come here every time I‚Äôm in Amsterdam. The old Jenever on a summer day combined with a light beer and their homemade meatballs is
the recipe for a perfect afternoon."
16,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,For alcohol tasting lovers. Its a tasting house of Bols which is a traditional locally produced liquor. Simon is the person who is kind enough to explain everything and takr you through the tasting
17,De Drie Fleschjes, 2 stars ,a year ago,"*Great beer. But the service. Came on a sunny afternoon to have a tipple and something for my driving brother. Still some seats outside we thought we'd been lucky. We were served by a grumpy man, talking in Dutch - both of us are foreigners ‚Ä¶"
18,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing athmosphere, one of the oldest bars in the city."
19,De Drie Fleschjes, 4 stars ,a year ago,"A very relaxed atmosphere. The man behind the bar was very friendly and knowledgeable. It was quite small though and we ended up sitting next to a few other couples, which is just not for me. If the weather had been better the outside seating would have been my preferred choice. I would definitely return."
20,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Anthony bourdain does not disappoint. Jenever was great. The meatballs are delicious. The ambience sends you back in time.

22,De Drie Fleschjes, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Typical Dutch winery. I have been here to taste a typical dutch spirit. The atmosphere is rowdy and the place is attended mostly by dutch people. Inside this pub there is a very strong smell of wine, barrels and grape must, and personally it disturbed me a lot. Prices average. Very bad beer."
23,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A must-do if you're in the Palace area - the bartenders are friendly and enthusiastic, and talked me through the traditions of their Genever. Not a ton of seating, even in the early afternoon, so be prepared to stop by, take a drink at the bar, and go. A fun introduction to a Dutch institution."
24,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wowww!
antique bar from the 17th century. The whole place is filled with private barrels. Some bars hire people to just work and make their money, but this place - it ‚Ä¶"
25,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We visited it since our Amsterdam Card included a free jenever shot here. The guy on the bar was really really nice, and the place looks the same it may have looked a hundred years ago. We really liked it!"
26,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A great coffee shop with rows of barrels of wine and spirits. Its like a tapas for the drinker. Located just of the main Dam square. In this city of many great coffee shops, this is a must try."
27,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,3 months ago,authentic bar with history and charm
28,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to try gins. Go inside & talk to the barman about what you like. The gin aged in Bourbon barrels was especially good. Unfortunately, they do not sell bottles"
29,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cozy. Great drinks, typical Dutch drinks, with a story or explanation if you need from friendly staff.
Can be busy (read too busy) on Friday evenings after work, but generally very accessible."
30,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,No trip to Amsterdam is complete without a stop here for a few shots of jenever and a beer or two. Each time we have visited here has been extremely interesting principally because of the people we met. They included Dietrich who offered us ‚Ä¶
31,De Drie Fleschjes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A must see if you ever visit Amsterdam. They tried hard to keep it as original as possible. That means 18th century pub style. It is sponsored by Bols which is one of the oldest and largest jenever brands. Try a ""boswandeling"" or a ""grave ‚Ä¶"
