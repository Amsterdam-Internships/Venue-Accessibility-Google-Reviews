0,Saffraan, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Come here if you want food with a burst of flavour. Everything we tried was very tasty a mix of med and north african cuisine. Must try the chickpeas !
1,Saffraan, 5 stars ,a month ago,Jan Pieter Heije’s O.G. Way before it was hip there. And going steady. One of Amsterdam’s best Deli’s. Cosy staff. Quality food. Evergreen.  Their tiramisu is without doubt the best in town. Italian’s don’t make this one better.
2,Saffraan, 1 star ,a year ago,Restaurant prices for buffet food. €13 for a lamb skewer and broccoli. When asking about the portion sizes I was told to buy more because I didn’t seem convinced. There’s better places on the same street to buy good food with the right portions at the same price.
3,Saffraan, 5 stars ,5 months ago,One of the best food I've eaten in Amsterdam. It is not cheap but worth it. The owner was extremely nice. The atmosphere is really cute and homy. I definitely recommend it.
4,Saffraan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a little gem to have a casual lunch, dinner and take away! A traiteur with dining possibilities as if you sit at mother kitchen table and food is cooked for you whilst you wait. Lovely!"
5,Saffraan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A homely feel to the place where you can see the chefs prepare the food on this long marble table. With soothing Mediterranean colours and jazz music playing in the background. …

9,Saffraan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had several dishes and it was all very delicious. We especially love the spinach chickpea curry and all the ingredients tasted really fresh. The staff was very warm too.
10,Saffraan, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"This place is more like a take-away food for after work. However they offer few small tables if you wan to sit down. They offer fresh cooked food, in a homemade style. There are choices for pasta, salad, meat, fish, etc. It's a bit pricey for take-away but always of top quality."
