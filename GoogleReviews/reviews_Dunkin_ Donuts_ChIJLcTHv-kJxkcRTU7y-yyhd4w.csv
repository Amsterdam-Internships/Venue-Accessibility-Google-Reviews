0,Dunkin' Donuts, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"The coffee isn't the best but the donuts are really fresh and delicious. If you go for the donuts, it's really worth it, there's a wide range and they're simply delicious. They have some seats to relax which is a plus."
1,Dunkin' Donuts, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Their coffe is absolutely disgusting especially the iced mocha.i mean i could feel the whatever powder they used to make,the taste was horrible,unsweetened.The consistency was light. In a few words im never buyung coffe from them again."
2,Dunkin' Donuts, 4 stars ,4 months ago,I had a coffee and a doughnut and it was really average
3,Dunkin' Donuts, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Dunkin Douts never disapoint me, the perfect option to quick breakfast. In Amsterdam definitly you must yo eat a stroopwafel donut."
4,Dunkin' Donuts, 1 star ,4 months ago,they did not have any donuts left although I ordered Too Good To Go. Now I'm 5‚Ç¨ poorer and still don't have anything in return.

7,Dunkin' Donuts, 1 star ,a year ago,"The waitress told me I can‚Äôt use there my koffiecadeaukaart and nobody else could help me because they didn‚Äôt have a manager on that moment. Maybe you should train better your staff , be more polite and not assume I‚Äôm not with someone who doesn‚Äôt speak Dutch and call me kranky."
8,Dunkin' Donuts, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great coffee. I didn't order doughnuts. I feel like the queue system could have been a bit better, as it was difficult for customers who received their orders and wanted to eat in to get past the customers who were ordering...but the shop ‚Ä¶"

11,Dunkin' Donuts, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A serious drawback is lack of customer toilets, an essential in my view to any sit down place offering coffee. Not presuming how other people systems work but mine pairs beverages with bathroom needs. Please Dunkin' Donuts inform patrons ‚Ä¶"
12,Dunkin' Donuts, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Actual nice service and if you like donuts then Dunkin' Donuts is the place to be. There's cheaper things in the world than these donuts, but sometimes you just have to cheat your diet a bit. A box of 6 for ‚Ç¨11,60 isn't too bad though. They're very tasty."
13,Dunkin' Donuts, 3 stars ,4 years ago,donuts are good. and deliciously sweet. tables inside do need a clean once in a while which seems not to be happening. resulting in very sticky tables. if that was done it had atleast one more star from us.
14,Dunkin' Donuts, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Unfriendly and bored staff. They had only a limited number of dough nuts. They do not use dividers/separators so all the doughs in the box get each other flavor. Not really professional as i would have expected. The doughs we bought tasted great. So 3 stars for the taste..
15,Dunkin' Donuts, 3 stars ,4 years ago,What you can expect from Dunkin Donuts like in the States. Not the best food and drink but it's something with sugar and coffee. üòâ
