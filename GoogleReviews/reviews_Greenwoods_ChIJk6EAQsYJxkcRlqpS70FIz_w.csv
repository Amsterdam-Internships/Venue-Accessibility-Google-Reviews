14,Greenwoods, 3 stars ,5 months ago,The food was average especially considering the price. But what really made my stay bad is the waitress. She wasn‚Äôt really happy to serve costumers. Once I finished with my food she not even interested of asking if I want a coffee or else ‚Ä¶

104,Greenwoods, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great brunch close to the centre of Amsterdam. It's a cute restaurant and, even if it can be a bit pricey, the food is worth the money. It's not a touristy place so I'd recommend it."
105,Greenwoods, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing place! The friendliest staff! Delicious food. Only the down side - the cafe it‚Äôs too small. Only few small tables and they are really tight placed. Also it‚Äôs not aloud to smoke on terrace.

We‚Äôve been here for 4 days now and have tried a few other breakfast cafes. Breakfast and lunch menu is serviced all day. I ordered the English breakfast and my husband ordered the Angus beef burger, both were really good."
222,Greenwoods, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for a breakfast in Amsterdam. They have a bright menu for a good price and you will be sated after a normal breakfast meal. Many options for vegetarian. Even the outside looked great. Sometimes you have to wait 5-10 min to get a seat but the time worth it.
223,Greenwoods, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Highly recomended. Everything is excellent - service is fast (especially considering how many of them there are, unlike many other places in Amsterdam), food is great, so is the coffee, portions are generous. Make sure to respect their sign ‚Ä¶"

226,Greenwoods, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing breakfast and not just saying that because my partner is obsessed with a proper hearty breakfast and that can be hard to find in the land of the Continental breakfast. It's beautiful prepared, fresh, and adorable inside. The kitchen is blazing fast and the wait staff are friendly and on their game."
227,Greenwoods, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"For my first meal in Amsterdam, based on a recommendation from a local, I tried Greenwoods for lunch.  This place is great.  Its really small and kind of cramped, but who cares?  The food is excellent and so is the service. ‚Ä¶"
228,Greenwoods, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food and lovely staff! Would recommend visiting for brunch. Staff were quick to take our order and food was really yummy.

254,Greenwoods, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food right on the Singel. Great breakfast with also quite some vegetarian options. They take no reservations on weekends, so you have to be early to keep the waiting time to a minimum. It‚Äôs not cheap but worth the price in my opinion."

266,Greenwoods, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This hole in wall is a gem in serving breakfast. They have an amazing selection of differently cooked eggs. Their Vegie egg platter is out of this world. Full of unique flavors that complement each other, certainly with their added halloumi that has a hint of sweet yet salty taste. Give it a try, u won‚Äôt regret it."
267,Greenwoods, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I know I was really, really hungry when I arrived at Greenwoods, but I can confidently say this is the single best club sandwich I have ever eaten. No contest. Lovely, cosy surroundings and friendly, attentive staff. Will definitely be back."

271,Greenwoods, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food along the canal. Service was fantastic.
272,Greenwoods, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Cute small breakfast joint! They serve breakfast all day along with their lunch options. Due to their small size you might have to wait for a table to open so get there early cause they get busy quick.
273,Greenwoods, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Honestly loved this spot both times we visited. The Veggie is so delicious and filling, I was actually looking forward to ordering it for a second time. Great prices. Speedy/friendly service. Definitely the place to go for a tasty breakfast/brunch."
274,Greenwoods, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The food here is fresh and has a good home cooked taste.  The cafe is very small if not uncomfortable at times.  The service is very slow with many people leaving before ordering.  This does not make this a bad place just be prepared. Worth a visit.
275,Greenwoods, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I haven't (yet) found food I want to do cartwheels for in Amsterdam. But as far as brunches go, this is one of the best I've come across so far.

Had the most wonderful breakfast here. Such great choices and really good portions. Very friendly staff. Can't recommend enough"
313,Greenwoods, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent - not really worth the hype of queuing for ages, but only place to go if you have a hankering for a full English in the Dam. Original twists on classic menus, the butter with pancakes is probably a bit to much for me personally...."
