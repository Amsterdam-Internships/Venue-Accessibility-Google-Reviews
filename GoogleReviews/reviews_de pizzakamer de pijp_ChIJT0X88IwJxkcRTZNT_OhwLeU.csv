0,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"One of the most delicious pizzas in Amsterdam, so it can be crowded, but absolutely worth it. Super tasty dough and a lot of sauce and fillings, delicious wine. Lovely personnel!"
1,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Fine pizza place, nothing high-brow, but just a simple menu, really friendly staff, decent wines (slightly more fancy glasses would suit the wine better) and excellent lasagna in tomato sauce. In the less crowded part of de Pijp, Amsterdam's great off-beat neighborhood. Just the way I like it."
2,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Best pizza in town! Thin crust without being dry, flavoured and good quality toppings, it‚Äôs really a must-try!"

7,de pizzakamer de pijp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice pizza restaurant in one of Amsterdams happening neighbourhoods. Have come here before and really enjoy the energy in the room. Small space with lots of bar seating. Also room for groups, but then you should book in advance. Amazing tasty pizza and quick service. You can't go wrong with De Pizzakamer."
8,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice small restaurant for pizza. We ordered three pizzas and lasagna Bolognese. The margarita was good but the star was the diavola pizza! Very tasty and spicy. The lasagna were just ok. For dessert we got a tiramisu and a conoli. Both were really good. We left very satisfied and would gladly visit again.
9,de pizzakamer de pijp, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"It's a good pizza place. The more complex pizzas have a little bit too much topping, missed good tomato taste on the simple one. For the price it's decent."
10,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Pizza pizza pizza. Some of the best I've had. If you can't get a table straight away you can sit at the bar until one is available. Great atmosphere, selection and attentive friendly staff. I want pizza here every day."
11,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"These guys have nailed the fundamentaIs in the art of pizzatry. This pizza was so good that it felt like a sin. In fact I decided to slice the pizza in the shape of a pentagram and mumble 'Judas, Judas, Judas' softly between bites. ‚Ä¶"
12,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The pizza is really solid, however do not expect any fireworks. Staff is friendly and the food came in rather fast."

26,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is the tastiest pizza I have ever had, period. Very very reasonable prices and the size of a pizza is great. Staff is nice and atmosphere is very energetic and lively- in a typical Pijp style. However, it is always very busy. You can book a table only for indoors and only during a specific time period."
27,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Have been to De Pizzakamer many times and have never been disappointed. Pizza is fantastic with many choices and super tasty. The place is not so big so sometimes you will need to wait for a table. We got in at 6:30pm tonight and got a spot ‚Ä¶
28,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,a month ago,"perfect

Great service for a very fair price."
29,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place with cool staff and not to forget, amazing quality pizza. That's something that's quite hard to find in Amsterdam. I would recommend to make a reservation as the place is quite popular. Finished eating? Either chill there with a drink or visit one of the amazing bars in the vicinity."
30,de pizzakamer de pijp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Pizza 9-15euro. Not awesome but good. Kind people with nice vibe.
31,de pizzakamer de pijp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"After witnessing how they wash - or shall I say not wash - the beverage glasses and let them stay with detergent, I don't know if I can drink here anymore nor eat. The pizza is really good for the crust but the pizza sauce is very acidic. ‚Ä¶"
32,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"De Pizzakamer, is one of the best pizza restaurants in Amsterdam, if not the best. The pizzas are just how they are supposed to be with the wright base and super fresh ingredients. The staff is really friendly and they will never push to ‚Ä¶"

35,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"I ordered pizzas to take away, it was quick and delicious. The team was really welcoming."
36,de pizzakamer de pijp, 1 star ,3 years ago,Their pizza is amazing but the wait is just horrible. We order takeouts and an hour later we go pick it up they say ‚Äúsorry there‚Äôs been a mistake‚Äù and they make us wait there and do it in front of us. It‚Äôs been 4 times already and this ‚Ä¶
37,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best pizzas I've ever had!!!  I ordered the pizza with farmer's cheese, mushrooms and ham, and when it first came out, I wasn't sure about it. However, one bite and I was hooked - I ate the whole thing because it was so good!  I wish I was still in Amsterdam so I could go back - yum!!!"
38,de pizzakamer de pijp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pizza con salciccia e tartufo. Period. I don't think I have ever ordered anything else, because it is simply that good. They change chefs every now and then, so the quality can vary a bit. But it never disappointed me. Great admosphere, not ‚Ä¶"
39,de pizzakamer de pijp, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great pizza for a bit higher price but the quality of the food matches the price. Only serves pizza as main, also some starters. The beer selection could be better but I only rate the food. Place was really crowded and a bit chaotic. Took 45 minutes but it was worth the wait. Would be 5* without the huge delay. Recommended!"
40,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Really good thin-crust wood over baked pizza. Great spot for dinner on a nice day when you can sit outside. They don't deliver but you can phone in an order and it will generally be ready in 20‚Äî35 minutes.
41,de pizzakamer de pijp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,If you like Pizza Roma style (thinner than Naples standard a little bit crustier) then this the place! The tiramis√π was really good as well. The place is really small so it get full really quickly
42,de pizzakamer de pijp, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"The pizza is good, not great. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere but the night we were there, the waiting time for a table, service and food was way too long. Splitting the cheque was possible, but the attitude of the waitress told me that she hated doing it."
43,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This was the 2nd best pizza I've had in my life!  The only 'better' was in Napoli.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere was great.  If you want to get away from a touristy atmosphere this is the place.
44,de pizzakamer de pijp, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Don‚Äôt expect a smile except from the manager and be ready to ask everything: napkins, forks, knives, water... oh and also not really friendly neighbours at your table. Fortunately pizzas are really good and indeed the place is cosy."
45,de pizzakamer de pijp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The pizza is delicious! The best i had in amsterdam so far, service cab be very slow though and i had to wait a lot to recieve the food, and to be able to order more drinks."
46,de pizzakamer de pijp, 1 star ,7 years ago,My expierience: I have been at Pizzakamer many times. I am Italian and I liked it. Suddenly something is changed; I go for 4 pizza takeaway. It takes a while but is ok as its busy. Half way my waiting time an other guy comes and asks for 2 ‚Ä¶
47,de pizzakamer de pijp, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Pizza nothing special. Fuoco vivo, La Perla or Pecorino are much better.
The real issue is the waiting time. You cannot make a reservation so you have to go there and ask for a table, the staff will always tell you with a smile ""oh ‚Ä¶"
48,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Pizzas are good, prices not too high, you can actually see the pizzaiolo prepare the pizzas and put them in the big oven, as the kitchen is completely open...Not my extra-favorite of all Amsterdam but still a great choice!"
49,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"They make the pizzas in a real oven, the quality is awesome and the price fair. I was there twice and very happy with the food quality and the service. They are great people as well. What a shame there are no more space inside and sometimes you have to wait for a free place, but it's worth."
50,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Best pizza place in town - and that says a lot!
51,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wowwee, easily the best pizza in Amsterdam that I have tried so far, I can't see it getting better than this, especially for the reasonable price. Add the truffle oil whatever you choose, trust me!"
52,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,a year ago,The best italian pizza so far in AMS üòã Delicious sauce and Marguerita!!!
53,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Certainly top 5 pizza place in Amsterdam. Very tasty pizzas both traditional and specials of the restaurant. Very good for family dinners. Can be quite busy on Fridays

57,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good pizzas. A bit small the place, so it seems that you are eating with the people of other table. But completely worth it for the pizza"
58,de pizzakamer de pijp, 4 stars ,8 years ago,I went here on due to a recommendation. Pizza was above average. The pizza oven makes a big difference. The place was full and we had to wait a while. A little expensive. Maybe as a treat for take away.
59,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A reliable local that‚Äôs particularly cosy in winter with the wood fire oven stoked up

64,de pizzakamer de pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Only walk in (or take away) but is worth the wait. The pizza is crusty and thin (Rome style) and the tiramis√π is special
