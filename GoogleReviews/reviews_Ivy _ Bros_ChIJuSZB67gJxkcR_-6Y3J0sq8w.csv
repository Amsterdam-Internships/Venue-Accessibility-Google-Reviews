77,Ivy & Bros, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We had the (vegan) sandwich with grilled veggies, which was so good! The atmosphere is very unique and the staff was super nice and helpful.

83,Ivy & Bros, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Kimchi soup in a non-Asian restaurant and it was GOOD!!!!! The chef explained us that it can't be as spicy as the traditional one but me and my husband loved it. The fritatta  was also delicious, the servive very kind and helpful. This place is small but everything looks amazing. I wish we had also a place like that were we live."
84,Ivy & Bros, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"WOW. This place blew me away. One of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time.

Waitress kept walking past and served other people‚Äôs drinks before ours, even when thes people had sat down after us? We got up and left as we had a tour at 2pm.

90,Ivy & Bros, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place is awesome! There are only a few tables but everything is made fresh at the moment with quality ingredients. There is a good choice of homemade cakes and if you are vegetarian I recommend the veggie sandwich, it is exquisit! The ‚Ä¶"
91,Ivy & Bros, 4 stars ,4 years ago,We reason we went here was because the internet told us that they have vegan options. When we arrived there I could not find any dish marked as vegan so we asked. The grilled sandwich is vegan and can as wished be eaten as a salat as well. ‚Ä¶
92,Ivy & Bros, 1 star ,a year ago,"i was there one year ago and i still have nightmares. Worst service on planet. We waited like 1,5 hours for food and didnt get discount. I sweard on my mothers grave that on day i¬¥ll do this recension."

96,Ivy & Bros, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely perfect canalside caf√© and restraunt! The food is very low price but by no means sacrifices quality. The owner is wonderfully kind and will engage with the costumers. The atmosphere is relaxing, and of course the food is impeccable. Nothing more I could ask for. If you are in Amsterdam you must come here!"
97,Ivy & Bros, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The sandwiches are wayy above average for a coffeeplace! Truly delicious, just like the cappuccino, and I‚Äôm picky on my cappuccino ;). I have my doubts with the eclectic interior, but that‚Äôs a matter of personal taste. The vibe is good and ‚Ä¶"

104,Ivy & Bros, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We ordered several things for breakfast.. They were all good except for the apple pie that was below average. The place is very central and in a super touristic place, hence the slightly higher prices it has on its items. I would recommend"

106,Ivy & Bros, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Only 5 tables and after 15 mins, I went up to ask to order (I already had to get my own menu)...I asked for the wifi password, they didn't have any for customer use only use. I then went to pay and they only took cash (which they should have pointed out before). Overall, it was the worst service I've experienced in Amsterdam."
107,Ivy & Bros, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food, absolutely beautiful atmosphere and service with amazing smiles! Only went in for lunch but ended buying a ring from there just so I can never dare to forget that place!
