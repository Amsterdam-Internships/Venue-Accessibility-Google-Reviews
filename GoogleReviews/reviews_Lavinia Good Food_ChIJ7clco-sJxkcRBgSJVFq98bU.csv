0,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Very tasty shakshouka - most probably one of the best I’ve tried in Amsterdam, but it’s a pity they removed the egg truffle pizzetta from the menu, because it was actually amazing!"
1,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Cool place with really nice food! High quality! The banana pancakes were absolutely aaaaaaamazing! …
2,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Really good scrambled eggs and salmon. Staff were really friendly. Coffee was a bit not to my taste but it didn't ruin anything!
3,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Good food but nothing extraordinary. I liked the pumpkin toast. Prices a bit high, but it's Amsterdam and they make no sense almost anywhere."
4,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Small & lovely Café with delicious food and vegan / gluten free options.
5,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Small cafe close to the center with a great variety of coffee specialties, cakes and breakfast options! The service is really nice - we did have some waiting time for the food, but the wait was totally worth it. Can recommend for a chill brunch, a healthy breakfast or a coffee with friends! ☕️"
6,Lavinia Good Food, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was nicely presented and the atmosphere was very nice. Food was okay. However; I do not regularly eat at ""Health Food Restaurants"" so my opinion on the food is from an outsider perspective. I thought the pancakes were hard and slightly dry. Service could have been better also."
7,Lavinia Good Food, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Have gluten free sandwiches and cakes. Food is fine, but portions are small. Very crowded - the tables are very close to each other and there are too many of them, so when all people are talking it’s so loud as if in a bar, so you cannot hear anything."
8,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This cafe was a highlight of my Amsterdam trip, an absolute gem hidden in the backstreets away from the tourist and commercial attractions. With delicious and inspiring food to please all I was gobsmacked at the flavours and the beauty of …"
9,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,a year ago,Friendly smiling staff! I couldn't find their menu on line to check their vegan options. In fact they have only a few available dishes and sadly no vegan option for pizza (I'd really recommend to think about it - hummus pizza is not a pizza …
10,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice cafe with great vegan and vegetarian food options. Nice staff, nice decor and yummy food. …"
11,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is an out of the way find. There is a laid back vibe(so don’t expect instant/fast food service). I’m not personally a vegetarian but my lunch was amazing. Highly recommended.
12,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good brunch, the duck breast pizzetta was so good we had to order another one. Also they serve delicious Bocca coffee. Yummy!"
13,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great Food and atmosphere. Amazing place for lunch or breakfast. Only gave four stars because it was a little too busy (took some time before we got the food)
14,Lavinia Good Food, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Not bad food but the staff didn't tend to tables promptly, didn't remember which table ordered what and also didn't check anyone for vaccinations upon entry asthey are obliged to"
15,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The shakshuka was heavenly. Add roasted eggplants!!
The place is busy with only a few staff so expect delays"
16,Lavinia Good Food, 1 star ,8 months ago,I was excited to try this address as I read good reviews about their vegan options. When I got there I was disappointed to see that there were only 2 vegan options left on the menu (my guess is that they shortened the menu post-covid?) : …
17,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely lunch, sweet little place of Vijzelstraat with a nice, eclectic decor and super large semi-open kitchen. My colleague and I both enjoyed a vegan burger with sweet potato fries. The latter were soft and soggy instead of crispy, but …"
18,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Happy healthy lunch place! Fantastic kitchen in the city center! Great Avo on toast and delicious pizza's. The Pumpkin and red onions will blow your mind!
19,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"best breakfast/lunch spot we visited in amsterdam! loved my breakfast pizza + matcha latte. & my boyfriend loved his eggs + toast & cappuccino! flavors were amazing, super fresh ingredients."
20,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good portions and very tasty food! I had the Teriyaki bowl and my friend the avocado toast. Perfect for a veggie and healthy lunch.
21,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 months ago,The choice of food is varied. Portions are good. Polite staff.
22,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The Food is really tasty and is all vegetarian with a lot of vegan options
The Portion size is good for the Price
We had the bowl with 3 ingredients
They also have nice vegan cakes and raw cakes"
23,Lavinia Good Food, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worst lunch I ever had. Soup tasted like dirty sour water, salad was bland and made almost only of chickpeas. Veggie meatballs were gross. Service was unwelcoming and unpleasant. Ran away  after paying and leaving most of my food there. Never coming back here again."
24,Lavinia Good Food, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Really bad, bad, bad place. Terrible service. Low quality food. Overpriced. Wrong bill even. Probably worst cafe I’ve ever been at"
25,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Seriously good tasty food. A variety  of lactose free options. Definitely worth a visit
26,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We were randomly recommended to visit this place and happy we did. Great service great breakfast and awesome coffee. Place is cozy and nice as well. Recommend a visit if you're nearby.
27,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really cosy place, nicely decorated, a little hip, serving organic food : spelt pizza, lentil soup, salad buffet, banana bread...The kitchen is semi-open. Perfect for lunch or a little meeting. Free wifi and no cash."
28,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super friendly staff, today's salad is fresh and tasty and not crazy expensive. Chill crowd, either meeting with friends or taking advantage of the wifi to work or read. Everything looks super fresh - therefore not too many items on the menu.
Recommended!"
29,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"All around great place to eat at, from the interior to the food and service. If your looking for something a little different than your ordinary lunchroom, check these guy out."
30,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Tiny restaurant. Filled with locals. NO tourists. A must visit on your trip. Really good food.
31,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This cute little place has the BEST lamb sandwich! Add extra avocado. You can’t go wrong here.
32,Lavinia Good Food, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Not great service - one of the waitress was extremely arrogant and didn't want to take our order for a long time
Food came out quickly though and it was good"
33,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Hidden gem in a nice area of Amsterdam. Very delicious healthy breakfast
34,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Good lunch, nicely prepared but pretty expensive."
35,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,a year ago,Incredible!!! This cafe is the dream for Vegans and that is coming from an individual who is not vegan! The quality of food in this cafe is amazing. I was spoilt for choice with the menu options so I had to get 2 dishes. I got an Açai bowl …

38,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious breakfast, lovely staff and beautiful ambiance"
39,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great experience and great food! We had the scrambled egg toast with salmon and vegan teriyaki. Very recommended! A bit pricy but the portions are fair. We asked for extra bread and did not pay extra for that.
Perfect for healthy food options."
40,Lavinia Good Food, 3 stars ,3 years ago,the food is great but way too expensive for the small portion sizes
41,Lavinia Good Food, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, reasonable price but... a bit disappointing quality of food: I had an avocado sandwich."
42,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this little cafe. Really nice coffee, cozy atmosphere and friendly service."
43,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I ordered the avocado toast with poached egg and smoked salmon - really enjoyable. Fresh and delicious with good quality ingredients. Service kind and quick and top notch relaxing ambience - worth a visit for a tasty and satisfying breakfast/brunch.
44,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome! I have tried the Lavinia's Bowl, and I was just perfect. Great taste, top quality ingredients and good size!"
45,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was so good we went back every day on our stay in Amsterdam. Catered for all our allergies, food was fresh, healthy and delicious. The Chai Latte is a must try. …"
46,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the avocado toast and orange cake with an oat milk latte. They were able to substitute the bread for the toast to gluten free. I felt like it could have had more flavor, but I added a squirt of lemon juice and salt and it was much …"
47,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This might be the best restaurant/cafe we've seen. It's so quaint and the food is ridiculous. Healthy and fresh and well done.  Friendly staff and gluten free options. Breakfast and lunch all day. Healthy sweets! Not sure how some reviewer …
48,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Go-to place for my vegetarian brunch. Fantastic eggs with vegan portobello ""bacon"" not to be missed. How they can make a simple thing seem luxurious, I have no idea. Avo total with poached eggs is another favorite. Try the carrot ginger juice. I branched out to their bowls, which are also original, fulfilling, yummy."
49,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,6 months ago,It is nice but there is not much choice in the menu
50,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice waiter service and tasty food. Enjoyed the place
51,Lavinia Good Food, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice staff. Nice place. Disappointing Food. Banana Pancakes had barely any banana in or on them and the ""seasonal fruits"" on top were a few tiny slices of pear laid around them and a scrapings of kiwi fruit. …"
52,Lavinia Good Food, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Absolutely avoid!!
I had a plate of spelled, tomatoes and fish.  It didn't look good, but I trusted it.  bad choice.  The taste was bad and it seemed spoiled.  I left the whole …"
53,Lavinia Good Food, 1 star ,2 years ago,"A very bad experience.  Me and my friends tried to eat there, the place was full, but we were willing to wait for a table, for which one of the employees told us that it was not possible, and asked us to go.  Just after us more people …"
54,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is yummy, like most healthy-organic eateries, Lavinia changes its menu on a daily basis. The choice is interesting, ranging from salad to fruity-muesli bowl. Lots of healthy options there at a reasonable price, plus the waitresses were friendly, which doesn't hurt ;)"
55,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice healthy food in a comfy setting. Lots of gluten-free and vegan options. The toast with toppings are nice - avocado and egg is a great option. The Lavinia breakfast has a mini smoothie bowl and the banana pancakes. Pancakes are nice but …
56,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great vibe however food underwhelming. My sister and I both got a raw food bar and pancakes they were good don't get me wrong but not the stack of pancakes I was expecting. If I was a vegan visiting Amsterdam it would not be on my must go-tos.
57,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Lovely rustic café; a great spot to dine alone or meet friends for coffee or a working lunch. Too many healthy options to choose from, so the lunch platter is a nice option - soup, avocado toast and your choice of veggie salad. Looking forward to going again on my next trip to Amsterdam!"
58,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly staff and a decoration that makes you feel like home. Special mention to the mister who is really attentive to the well-being of the customers. Another mention to the well balanced vegan egg salad sandwich.
59,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Foods looks nice, cosy atmosphere and mid-range prices. Small but cosy."
60,Lavinia Good Food, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"2 words: veggie bacon.   Do you know what it is? Apparently it is sliced mushrooms and it is also something you can order with your sandwich at Lavinia.   In fact, you won't be able to find normal bacon here or moat any other meat here.  So it's only good food if you love veggies."
61,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A beautifully decorated healthy food oasis in Amsterdam. The smoothie bowl was wonderful as well as the orange (carrot, apple, ginger) juice. My boyfriend had the avocado toast with salmon and it was amazing. Definitely a great stop for some healthy food!"
62,Lavinia Good Food, 1 star ,3 years ago,Had lunch here recently whilst in Amsterdam. Ridiculously under-staffed. Ordered an overpriced ‘veggie bacon’ (portobello mushrooms fried in a pan...). The manager was disorganised and really seemed to primarily care about profit over creating an experience for diners. Definitely a tourist trap.
63,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very friendly staff, multiple vegan options, nice atmosphere"
64,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Cute breakfast spot, great interior decor - I love that they have books of all sorts around the cafe for you to read. The banana delivery was late so I did have to wait 20 mins for my Acai bowl but I just picked up one of the cooking books …"
65,Lavinia Good Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What a lovely place! Had carrot cake and it was just delicious. Relaxed ambience, great customer service and plenty of vegan options - what else do you need!"
66,Lavinia Good Food, 1 star ,3 years ago,We arrived at this cute cafe Myself and my partner are the only customers in there. I have never experienced worse service from a place that wasn’t busy at all. We sat down didn’t get greeted and the two staff memebers were sat down talking …

68,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Expensive (most places are in Amsterdam) but great coffee and overnight oats.

70,Lavinia Good Food, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"If you have allergies, vegan or gluten intolerant, this is a great place as their menu really caters to those needs. Otherwise, it is an ok cafe with decent food, great ambiance and very slow service."
71,Lavinia Good Food, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Good service and very nice food. Some dishes and especially drinks seem te be quite expensive. It can get VERY crowded, so don't come here unless you like it very cozy. Get the lunch platter for the best deal."
72,Lavinia Good Food, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"First experience was great. Second time we went the waitress seemed to just not want to take our order or speak to us. Continuously made eye contact but she never came over, so we walked out"

75,Lavinia Good Food, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Staff and place is really nice. The food what we ordered was not so great. The Granola Bowl and Lavinia Bowl. The atmosphere is good.
76,Lavinia Good Food, 1 star ,6 years ago,I had very bad service there girls are arrogant and slow... Like very slow... Especially when they get busy they are so slow that they cannot handle so many customers. …
