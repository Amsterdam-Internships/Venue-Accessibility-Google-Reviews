4,Skek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great place! It is divided in two, a restaurant section and a bar section. I think the place is super cozy and the staff is sooo friendly and helpful. They are very fast and the food is great. The location is also super central and the prices are super nice! Definitely one of the places that I frequently visit!"
5,Skek, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great place with exceptionally friendly staff. Burgers are epic, but it's also a good place to just grab a drink and enjoy the music & atmosphere. Also very suitable for vegetarians/vegans with plant-based options that are just as tasty as the non-veg ones! Very affordable given the location, suitable for both locals and tourists."
