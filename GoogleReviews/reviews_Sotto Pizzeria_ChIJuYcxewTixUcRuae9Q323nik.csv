2,Sotto Pizzeria, 3 stars ,7 months ago,I expected more from this place but it kind of disappointed. It looked very promising from the outside and the restaurant itself looked very nice. But the food was mediocre. It‚Äòs very hard to mess up a Pizza but they figured it out. My ‚Ä¶

5,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Pizza is quite good! Portion size just right. Prices decent. Would be nice if they expand their wine card.
6,Sotto Pizzeria, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Dough was undercooked, which made it impossible to eat a slice at the restaurant with your hands...
The pizza was served without being sliced into 8, which I guess they don't do ‚Ä¶"
7,Sotto Pizzeria, 2 stars ,a year ago,I know Covid times are hard times for everyone. And of course having a pizza delivered is not the same as eating it at the restaurant. But the quality of this is pizza is way below acceptable. In that street you can find some other places with much higher quality.

13,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,a year ago,"45‚Ç¨ for this beauty. Not cooked, and the white you see is not cheese, is raw dough."
14,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food tasted and looked good, proper pizza oven here and good classic tiramisu (may be too much rum in it). Quite expensive. What‚Äôs really bad here - if you order water they bring you a tiny bottle instead of a proper large one or free ‚Ä¶"
15,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great selection of thin crust Italian pizza. Been here many times.  This and La Perla are the best in town. Would happily upgrade my review to 5 stars if they ever decide to start providing more than the ""typical dutch"" service... e.g., 1) ‚Ä¶"

20,Sotto Pizzeria, 3 stars ,a year ago,"We tried this place as there's a lot of hype around it and sometimes it is mentioned as the best pizza place in Amsterdam; however (as Italians) we were not impressed. The dough didn't smell right, and overall the quality of the pizza was poor. I have to say that the antipasto misto was good though - genuine products."

25,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favorite places in Amsterdam, definitely the best pizza - I just highly recommend to eat them at the restaurant, it loses a lot with delivery or take away. Ingredients are brought from Italy, combinations are great in a short but ‚Ä¶"

29,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We booked this for our group of 9 on a city break and we all loved it. Fantastic pizza and not a single issue for any of us. Menus are only in Dutch but that's not an issue as you'd expect in Amsterdam and let's be fair, pizza is pizza in ‚Ä¶"

33,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,a month ago,Delicious pizza and nice place!
34,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great quality pizzas. Really thin, proper buffalo mozzarella full of taste, and with sweet San Marzano tomatoes. Everything tasted very fresh. The service was really quick. More of a friends & business restaurant than for a romantic date."
35,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is a bit of a hit and miss.
The pizza is one of the best in Amsterdam, but the waiting staff seem undertrained! ‚Ä¶"
36,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,4 years ago,"What an experience: pizzas late with 55 min. Then wrong pizzas brought to the table. Then finally the right pizzas came however undercooked (raw toe). Waitress confirmed beers are on them, although nothing wrong with the beers. Then beers ‚Ä¶"

39,Sotto Pizzeria, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice environment, cosy, hipster, friendly staff. However, the pizza was poorly cooked. I can actually say raw for my taste. There was too much liquid from poorly baked pizza and it's quite thin... maybe a matter of taste, but my friend's pizza was similar."
40,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Not a single Dutch word spoken. Their English isn't really good either. It's Italian all the way, preferably. But don't worry, it's Italian, all the way. Greatest pizza i ever consumed. Baked in a great oven and made with traditional ingredients. Don't expect conventional pizzas. Those are so 2000..."
41,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It was a bizzy Sunday night, but it was wonderful. Amazing quick service. A great manager who really cared about the well being of the guest.

42,Sotto Pizzeria, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a dinner with two friends. Two of us had the San Daniele pizza, it was very dry, almost no mozzalla, and the tomato base was inexistant. I asked the waiters to add something because the pizza was tasteless, they just brought cold tomato ‚Ä¶"

47,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best pizzas I've ever had outside of Italy. They are proud of their Napolitan trademark and that's only just: the crust is thin and of perfect consistancy, the sauce is delicious and all the ingredients are fresh.
This undervalued place is definitely a must visit if you're around!"
48,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We loved it! We read the reviews before going and they are absolutely right about this place.  Focaccia parmigiano, pizza (we had the carnaval salsicia (this is a special star shaped pizza) and the margarita extra) and the panna cotta are ‚Ä¶"
49,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pizza is of the Napolitano style, hence the larger and softer crust. The toppings are typical, with high quality ingredients. I suggest the tartufo if you like truffle. It's pretty awesome. Service is good too!"
50,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,3 years ago,"What a disappointment!

We visited this place a couple months ago. And we fell in love with the place, ‚Ä¶"
51,Sotto Pizzeria, 3 stars ,a year ago,Nice Neapolitan pizzas but we were a bit disappointed by the dough which was too compact (not airy enough). The spicy salami pizza was also too salty.
52,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Pizza Margherita was amazing-thin, crispy, with a juicy sauce on top. Il sole rosso( red wine) complimenting it.  Pizza was served super fast despite of a crazy busy atmosphere in the restaurant. Can definitely recommend a place and for sure I will come back soon."
53,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very delicious, nice interior. Great value for money. The house salad is amazing, order one to share with your pizza. All with italian ingredients."

57,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Probably one of the best pizzas in Amsterdam. I tried the Tartufo pizza and it was delicious. Service is also really good, even though some of the staff did not seem to speak Dutch. Great option overall and not yet too dominated by tourists."
58,Sotto Pizzeria, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice little place, but the pizza was mediocre at best. The dough was very rubbery with some burnt spots. Ingredients were tasty, but mozzarella on my pizza wasnt properly melted. Can't really recommend."
59,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Been a few times now, the pizza is amazing however the service is absolutely shocking. I will never go again just because of how I was approached a few days ago. I walked in with my friend and asked for a table for two.. my only response ‚Ä¶"
60,Sotto Pizzeria, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Great pizza, but the management needs to understand how to treat customers. Rude, unwelcoming and to be told you have to buy a glass of water even after you ordered a round of drinks.....do me a favour. The waitress was nice but the problem ‚Ä¶"
61,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"SOTTO has a great ambience and vibe for this reasonably priced and friendly Amsterdam pizza place. The food is made in real stone ovens in the small venue, very clean store, music and restroom. Quite busy with locals and tourists enjoying the food every night which makes it a vibrant and almost too popular(few seats) pizza place."
62,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I like the pizza but have never experienced service as rude - I ordered to pick up, was there at the time indicated for me and when I arrived I was sent out in the cold to wait because it was ""too busy"". While 4 other people were allowed to ‚Ä¶"
63,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I love this place. I lived in Naples for a couple of years and since  I have been trying to find a pizzaria that is able to come near to the pizzeria I went to in Naples( in both taste as in ambiance) . And finally I found one: Sotto pizza. ‚Ä¶
64,Sotto Pizzeria, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The place is really nice and very Italian. The staff is Italian and the menu also but they speak english as well. Not the kind of pizza I like do. Taste was great but really really thin and the sauce is to liquid so the pizza was very soft ‚Ä¶

85,Sotto Pizzeria, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I had dinner here with my girlfriend, eating two pizzas.
Mine was nice, as a napoletan-kind of amsterdam, and the one of my girlfriend too. I cannot put the half star, I wouls give to this 3.5 or 7.5 in a grade, since the price is ok for amsterdam and you can have a full dinner with one pizza easily."
