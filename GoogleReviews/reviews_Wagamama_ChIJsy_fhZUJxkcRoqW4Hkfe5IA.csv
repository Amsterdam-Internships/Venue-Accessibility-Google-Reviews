0,Wagamama, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"It's a big chain, and it shows, very comfortable and the food is up to the usual standards, but it's not the most picturesque or unique atmosphere. I guess what I mean is, if you're looking for old favorites or comfort food it's the place …"
1,Wagamama, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Looking at the photos it looks like the food is good quality but it was tasteless and too spicy. I ordered a home delivery and I was very disappointed.
The broth doesn't taste like anything (even though we ordered the curry broth) …"

8,Wagamama, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Good food, friendly service, cozy place"
9,Wagamama, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Quite good! Kind of expensive if you’re looking for a traditional ramen, and very much occidentalized, barbecue with beef in a ramen? I don’t know but it was still very tasty and the staff was friendly. The fruit juices are also really good!"
10,Wagamama, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Wow! I really liked the ramen. They also have many vegan options.
11,Wagamama, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Always a great place to eat. All fresh and very nice food.
12,Wagamama, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"WagaMama is a convenient food spot. Asian flavor, standardized menus, fast service. Good for your lunch or a quick evening meal"
13,Wagamama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, excellent Japanese food. Ramen was amazing and so were the other plates the family and I ordered. I was expecting to see a few staff members at least japanese-clad, none of them were, it would be a nice addition, nevertheless …"
14,Wagamama, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food tastes great, came our really fast. Nice servers. Only thing was that we didn't get our mains at the same time. Also, they dont have a lot of deserts. Everything else was fine."
15,Wagamama, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Great restaurant with interesting food offer. Beware of the seat reservation via Google maps service. We got an email that reservation was approved by restaurant, but restaurant does not guarantee that they will make a reservation. Staff don't solve the situation, he talks unnecessarily and makes excuses. A bit disappointed..."
16,Wagamama, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The restaurant is rather large amd can get crowded. There is a comfortable waiting area. I was impressed by their ingredient guide that outlines all common allergens. I have never seen that in another restaurant. It greatly helped our …
17,Wagamama, 1 star ,3 months ago,"The food is usually good, but my delivery today was disappointing. Meat was cold, no cutlery like I requested for and the portion was underwhelming. €20 I’ve lost forever."
18,Wagamama, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Really nice food and staff, though they got some things in my order mixed up. They were really eager to make things right. Was a bit overwhelmed cause all the food seemed so interesting"
19,Wagamama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good service! We didnt have to wait in line this time, but usually you do. They sometimes have something new in the menu and I mostly do want to try them out. And so far it hasnt been dissapointing. My sisters took the bulgogi soba …"
20,Wagamama, 1 star ,4 months ago,The ramen has not flavor at all. I asked for spicy and my ramen came without the chili. When I pointed it out to the waiter I was given chili oil to compensate which didn't help at all. The 'tea-stained' egg that comes with the shirodashi …
21,Wagamama, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"So happy with the several vegetarian options. My tofu bowl was scrumptious, & I appreciated the option of extra spicy sides."
22,Wagamama, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Delicious food. It is pretty expensive (as whole Amsterdam) and I do not recommend ramen here if somebody is looking for a traditional one.
But my top dishes are: …"
23,Wagamama, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The ramen was good, but the service wasn't. The staff was not friendly and did not make me feel welcomed in the place."
24,Wagamama, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Came here for the ramen and I have to say that it want up to my expectations. The broth was a bit bland and lacked flavor and umami. The noodles were not ramen noodles that you get at a good shoyu place. Many of my noodles were broken, in …"
25,Wagamama, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Wagamama is one of my favorite restaurants in England and finding it in Amsterdam was great. I liked the food and the service was also good and quick. the shakes were very good also. I took a Chilly chicken Ramen, which is one of my favourites"
26,Wagamama, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Great place, food and staff! I’m just very surprised how many seating places there were. Imagining how it was like pre-covid, I don’t think I would want to eat here during peak dinner times"
27,Wagamama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The biggest fan of Wagamama, and this Wagamama really has my first review. The staff was outstanding. We had an amazing time. Was my birthday and our server Errol managed to help my husband put up a small surprise and helped us celebrate …"
28,Wagamama, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Donburi with fried duck is absolutely amazing!

31,Wagamama, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very friendly staff and nice environment. The quality and taste of the food is high and they use fresh ingredient, so you'll enjoy your meal most probably. Highly recommend if you went there to try Power drink ( apple , spinach, ginger )"
32,Wagamama, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Bad restaurant. Food is ok but people are slow and are not taking up order right. Got the bill after asking 5times and waiting for 10min. Never gonna come back
33,Wagamama, 5 stars ,a year ago,Super nice dishes and you get your food fast
34,Wagamama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Probably the best ramen I've ever had! Excellent service and amazing food. The place looks really cool and I will definitely visit again! Big plus for the waiter who asked me if I wanted my food with or without coriander since I hate it. You saved my meal bro! Also loved their beer menu! Thanks for the great experience!
35,Wagamama, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food here is very Well, taste but not cheap, the bun's is very recomended.
I dont recomend to order chicken with the noodels, it was very dry for me."
36,Wagamama, 1 star ,4 months ago,Worst service I have ever experienced. Haven‘t received any drinks although we reminded several times. Plus additional unprofessional services. Go somewhere else!

38,Wagamama, 4 stars ,5 years ago,My family and I popped into Wagamama on our last night in Amsterdam  while we were searching for a place to have dinner. We were very satisfied with the service and the food was great and matched to our taste. Usual portions were also …

40,Wagamama, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Ordered a shirodashi ramen. Many ingredients - worth the price of 14.70 euros. However, broth tasted like it had 5 tablespoons of salt inside. Highlighted this to the friendly hall staff when he came to ask if the food was ok. He said he …"

44,Wagamama, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Been a fan of Wagamama's food since the first time I tried it in London! Service has also been excellent at all times! However, just today I placed an order over phone and went on to pick it up. After returning home with my order i realized …"
45,Wagamama, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Eating at Wagamama means high quality food, nice atmosphere and nice drinks. The place can get crowded with a few people. Poor building planning makes this a echo chamber. Love the food and it has a good price / quality. Decent lighting with open kitchen."

49,Wagamama, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing place and very friendly staff. Following all the safety guidelines of social distancing
50,Wagamama, 5 stars ,a year ago,The best Boa Buns (Beef) I have ever eaten. I work across the street from the location and I can always call in for a set to take away a few minutes later. Warm and super delicious.
51,Wagamama, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Ordered out…regretted it

We ordered food, gyoza (dry no dipping sauces came with) and two soba dishes. …"
52,Wagamama, 1 star ,8 months ago,Very disappointed that the new menu only includes 1 gluten-free main course. Even the pad-thai which is made out of rice noodles is no longer an option. Room for improvement Wagamama!
53,Wagamama, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The food was so delicious !!! The place is quiet and big, very very nicely decorated. The service is very pleasant. I highly highly recommend coming here !!!"
54,Wagamama, 5 stars ,a month ago,A pleasant place to unwind with friends and family. Dine here please!!!!!

58,Wagamama, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This can be classified as one of the worst food I ever had in my whole life. The staff working there looked like nice people, the atmosphere was decent, the location was convenient but why was the food itself from hell? If a choice must be …"

62,Wagamama, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food was excellent but it was very strange that the dishes arrived in so different times. We got the starters after a friend already finished her main meal. So she was finished with her meal and we had to wait another 30mins after we …

64,Wagamama, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was fair. Had one particularly rude waitress who moved us in the middle of our meal. But then had another incredibly kind and helpful waitress that we absolutely loved. Food is pretty good. The noodles were okay, definitely not as …"

Our dishes were not served at the same time ;-("
66,Wagamama, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Awful service. Took 25 minutes from being seated until we saw a waitress. Took another 30 minutes to get food.. not our food. Order was incorrect several times. After 1.5 hours, never brought my wife’s food. We finally left and she had to …"
67,Wagamama, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I came back to this restaurant remembering very good fusion food. Today I was really disappointed from the behaviour of one of the waiters. When I arrived he was shouting against a chef. Then when he served my lunch, after 1 hour that I …"

71,Wagamama, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great place! Tasty dishes
72,Wagamama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"My first ramen. Liked it, but was not that in to the meat served in it. We where eight people, so we got to taste a lot from the menu. It was a nice place, but a bit to food court to get a 5*. Would rate a 4,5*.  But still liked the place …"
73,Wagamama, 1 star ,a year ago,"Disappointing food, I payed 14,70 for ramen and got 4 ingredients: noodles, spring onion, spinach, something they think is kimchi and chicken. All in a broth that's surprisingly similar to plain boiled water......"
74,Wagamama, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was good Wagamama, however the service was less than impressive. Ordered 2 starters and two main courses; I'm aware that any dish could come at anytime but hey started with the main for one person and 15 minutes later and after a …"

91,Wagamama, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I ordered the Wagamama Ramen and my husband took the Firecracker with rice and what a lovely Sunday meal we both had. The restaurant is situated in the center of the city yet has a cozy feeling. Loved the atmosphere there!
92,Wagamama, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food's not bad, but the waitresses don't know what they're doing... Brought us the wrong order, we told her but she was practically rolling her eyes. In the meantime they got wrong orders also on other tables around us."
93,Wagamama, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been to multiple restaurants of this chain (in London, at Amsterdam Station, in Utrecht etc), and everytime I was more than satisfied. However, here the portions are pitifully small. Moreover, the photo's and descriptions of the food …"
94,Wagamama, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Food was surprisingly good. I had my expectations low because of the location and dude of the place (potential tourist trap) but it turned out ok. Staff could be more involved and more polite though. They seemed tired with their jobs.
95,Wagamama, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Tasty dinner. It's crowded during weekends but I liked the good vibes.
96,Wagamama, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place and delicious food (several vegan options)
97,Wagamama, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Had a shrimp curry that tasted okay but had very small and few prawns. You can definitely get better quality at a Thai restaurant for the same price. The service was ok and the place looks nice.
98,Wagamama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Just your average wagamamas. The staff were okay and friendly. Well laid out place to eat but there is a limit to how good it can really be.
Not the cheapest place to get good ramen in Amsterdam"
99,Wagamama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Always loved wagamama concept, but the menu is always confusing and you really need to be an Asian expert to understand it, waiters should anticipate this and give you some help  but they dont, I had the pad thai it was ok, a bit bland in taste and missing some flavors."
100,Wagamama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good restaurant, polite and helpful staff, nice atmosphere, good for a lunch or dinner with friends. Chicken katsu curry is a must. food tasted fresh and full of flavours."
101,Wagamama, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Service was friendly and fast. But the ramen we had were horrible, this was just hot water with overcooked noodles without taste. On top of that it was rather pricey. Wouldn't recommend to fans of real asian kitchen."
102,Wagamama, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I came here for ramen.
Restaurant it self looks good but I strongly recommend to avoid ramen... ingredients weren't fresh ( clams and chicken) and the broth tasted like water with no …"
103,Wagamama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good restaurant, nice staff. Friendly prices and big portions. Every one can find the best option of tasty meal for him. Every time I am come to Amsterdam I come back fo another plate of soup."
104,Wagamama, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely place! Great staff, amazing juices and starters. As a vegetarian I took their veggie ramen and got quite disappointed, it was tasteless and too many mushrooms... It also could be bigger vegetarian selection"
105,Wagamama, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Food was good but nothing special. It came at different times with the explanation that it's all prepared fresh. So it's the case in other restaurants. If you know one dish takes longer start preparing it a little earlier. Service only ok. Further you can only make a reservation for more than 6 ppl.
106,Wagamama, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Young, hip, fast, loud -- chicken katsu was fantastic but my soba noodles.were meh.  If I hadn't been hung over and also watching money, I probably would have been more impressed."
107,Wagamama, 5 stars ,5 months ago,One of the best wagamamas we've been.
108,Wagamama, 5 stars ,6 years ago,I had a lunch at Wagamama in the Centraal Station (not listed on google maps?) and I really enjoyed the food (yaki soba) . …
109,Wagamama, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I had a Ramen with chicken for €13,5. unfortunatly it had no Special Asian Taste, it was more like grannys chicken soupe. I missed some spices. I was a bit disappointed. Service was ok. I wont visit it again."
110,Wagamama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good Ramen, good food!"
111,Wagamama, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I just love its Pad Thai! Tasty and big portion. Waiting service was really nice and friendly, the manager not so much (she wasn't friendly at all when we asked for the bill, and she never brought it)"
112,Wagamama, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"Went there this week for the first time while on a day trip to Amsterdam.
The first waiter who served us (a black guy, don't know his name) was being extremely helpful and friendly and did warn us that the two dishes we ordered may …"
113,Wagamama, 2 stars ,6 years ago,For those reading this review and already familiar with the wagamama restaurants from the UK like myself you will find this a similar concept and style but the noodles are under par hence the review would be 6/10 but if you know your Asian …
114,Wagamama, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"I was working late and decided to order some Pad Thai ""with vegetables."" I'm not sure what they consider a vegetable, because there was nothing that qualified in my opinion. Noodles, a few sprouts, some leaves, a piece of chive -- and for …"
115,Wagamama, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Small and expensive portion. If you intend to eat a lot of rice, a good place, but to eat a normal portion of protein, forget it: my curry chicken came just 4 pieces and one with bone!"
116,Wagamama, 5 stars ,a year ago,One of my favourite places. Amazing place and very friendly staff. Following all the safety guidelines of social distancing.
117,Wagamama, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Always lovely, fresh and delicious food. One of my favorite spots. Very tourist friendly and they can handle lot's of people.
Deffinately recommend them. Also check out their movie menu!"
118,Wagamama, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food for a good price. However the communal dining experience/ shared tables can be a bit intense if you're looking for a more intimate setting.
119,Wagamama, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food, quick service."
120,Wagamama, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is decent but the rest is a sad anonymous place. First thing they say when you sit... ""food is not gonna arrive at the same time""
Our starters arrived at the end of the dinner..."
121,Wagamama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent food, nice services. Sometime they could pay bit more attention to the order, but it's fine."
122,Wagamama, 1 star ,4 years ago,"After waiting almost 30 mintues, for my food. I found shell, in my chicken katsu. The restaurant claimed it was a chicken shaving. However chicken have feathers, not scales. …"
123,Wagamama, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, fast delivery, stuff is nice and speak fluent English all times. The service is a bit un-personal and ‘cold’ but for the rest great Asian restaurant in the center with great quality/price"
124,Wagamama, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Chicken katsu was good but the ramen wasn't great (terrible noodles and thin broth).  Price definitely isn't worth it. Substandard service as well for Amsterdam.
125,Wagamama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My friend was convinced you could buy a certain therapeutic plant here, based on the fact that it's situated in Amsterdam. He's not very smart. Food was great though."
126,Wagamama, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The place is confortable, quiet, and you get positioned quickly, the meat is good also, but in the ramen I asked for, I really wouldn't call the soup especial, it was even plain."
127,Wagamama, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The curry is delicious! Noodle dishes already got positive reviews from our companions. Service was a bit slow.
128,Wagamama, 1 star ,8 years ago,"I've been here several times since I work in the same building, but have decided not to go ever again. …"
129,Wagamama, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Pros: brought to you right when it's cooked, consistent quality, decent broth.
Cons: Not really Japanese ramen noodles, broth is quite similar between different orders, very pricy for the quality."
130,Wagamama, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very tasty food, with rather large portions. Slightly on the pricier side, but it is worth it. The staff are polite and helpful."
131,Wagamama, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We immediately got a table without a reservation, though reservation is recommended. And the curry looked unique and was really very good. Staff was very nice."
132,Wagamama, 1 star ,7 years ago,"Let's start all over again for you guys: I run a restaurant 101.

Lecture 1. …"
133,Wagamama, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Service was so-so and the food was a bit pricey. However the dishes tasted good and the location is hard to beat. Try the seared tuna.
134,Wagamama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I like Wagamamas, but this was a really nice branch. The food was great, as usual. We also had a really friendly and helpful waiter. Thanks!"
135,Wagamama, 2 stars ,5 years ago,I don't get what is going on there but this is the 4th time we've been there and still - most of the orders can be out wrong. My daughter is vegan and you'd think this is the place to go but unfortunately you need to very patient and not hungry when you go there.
136,Wagamama, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Overpriced fast food Asian modern style restaurant. To pay around 15€ for getting mainly rice with some pieces of meat is not what I understand for a great dinner.
137,Wagamama, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The service was fast and friendly. They were extremely wheelchair friendly with no stairs and had a disabled toilet. Everything was accessible, tasty, and stress free."
138,Wagamama, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food as Wagamamas always is, however the service in the particular restaurant was appalling, we were waiting to have our order taken for a good 20 minutes and then waiting for bill to come for about another 20 minutes."
139,Wagamama, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Located right in front of Rembrandt Eden hotel
140,Wagamama, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely food, i took the katsu chicken and fell in love with it!!! My new favorite in town😎"
141,Wagamama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good ramen noodles, the service was good and we recieved the food very fast! …"
142,Wagamama, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"High price, low quality and worst ramen I have ever had. Service was quite good though and it is the only reason I don't give a 1."
143,Wagamama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was in 19 July. Waiter man with beard was very friendly. Thank you bro👍 food amazing 🥣
So highly recommended 👨‍🍳👩‍🍳"
144,Wagamama, 1 star ,3 years ago,Half of the ordered dishes never arrived.. they didnt prepare anymore juices after 21:30.. didnt have any beef tataki left.. very bad experience.. not professional at all..
145,Wagamama, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Service was great. Food was great! I had the teriyaki donburi and the duck wraps. They were both delicious! 10/10 highly recommend

151,Wagamama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,One of my favourite restaurants in any city and this one is tucked just off rembrandtplein. Always good food
152,Wagamama, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Love this chain of restaurants. I go there everytime I'm in a city that has one. Great food in a nice setting
153,Wagamama, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I asked for a Wagamama ramen and a lettuce duck wraps. The ramen ingredients were not fresh, the wraps were watery and the meat was dry. The staff were friendly though."
154,Wagamama, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"The food was OK although the salmon soup with soba noodles was too salty.
Dear wagamama soba is buckwheat not wheat.  Buckwheat is gluten free  and wheat not ofcourse"
