0,Sale e Pepe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This restaurant is just amazing. Staff is very professional and kind, food is fantastic. It was perfect choice for our 3rd wedding anniversary dinner. We have really enjoyed our evening and left happy and full. Thank you!"
1,Sale e Pepe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice place where eating a pizza is a special experience. Situated in a quite area 2 minutes from Rembrandt Plain they offer a large selection of pizza and daily dishes like pasta and meat.
2,Sale e Pepe, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Really poor experience, don't let the good reviews fool you.
The service was odd at best, removing our menus before we ordered etc, which I now know was because they were trying to pull a fast one on myself and my mother. …"
3,Sale e Pepe, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Five star service, food, attendance and dessert! Pure tastes and lovely music playing in the background. Totally recommended! :-)"
4,Sale e Pepe, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly service, delicious food and great home made Tiramisu. Recommended! The only comment I'd have is the noise level. Can get very loud when fully booked. Other than that great."
5,Sale e Pepe, 1 star ,3 years ago,"What started out as a lovely dinner ended up as one of our worst dining experiences. The restaurant is definitely short staffed and ""the manager"" is the one tending tables and bar. We waited over 50minutes for my husband's meal to come out, …"
6,Sale e Pepe, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely food! Great hospitality, we really enjoyed our dinner here both times so far."
7,Sale e Pepe, 1 star ,3 years ago,"A very disappointing experience. The prices are a bit high relative to the quality of the food and the service far from attentive. I suppose our expectations of 'authentic Italian cuisine' were too high. In fact, just ordinary food served by people who don't much care if the customer is taken care of."
8,Sale e Pepe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A lot of suvaniers to buy
The weed and the cannabis things are just for the taste"
9,Sale e Pepe, 1 star ,3 years ago,we were 2 adults and 2 kids at the restaurant and we asked to get the kids order first. our order for the adults hasn’t arrived for over an hour of waiting. we’ve been asking many times for our order and they kept saying it is coming out …
10,Sale e Pepe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I'm the kind of person that's really sceptical when it comes to eating out in Amsterdam, especially when it comes to Italian Cuisine. Never quite seem to get the right authentic experience, however at sale e pepe, just such a lovely …"
11,Sale e Pepe, 1 star ,3 years ago,"One of the worst. We saw a mouse running around. Service was -5. We had to ask for everything 3 times. Drinks please, food please, the forgot our order with every round. The personel was in full stress mode. They told us the.chef was not …"
12,Sale e Pepe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The pasta a parmigan is incredible.  They toss your pasta in a giant wheel of parmasean right at your table and they light it on fire!!! It’s so delicious!  We always come here when we visit Amsterdam.
13,Sale e Pepe, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Poor service - felt as if the waiters did not want to be there and we were bothering them when asking for simple requests such as water or the bill. Food is very overprice despite’s it low quality. The place was empty when we went (and now we see why). We will try something else next time
14,Sale e Pepe, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The tiramisu was delicious, the highlight of my dinner. The seafood pizza as well as the duck breasts were not that tasty. Nothing special with the minestrone soup or the bruschetta. I was a bit disappointed."
15,Sale e Pepe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly as well! I can definitly recommend this   a visit to this restaurant.
