0,Radion, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The place to dance! I went to parties with techno or psychedelic trance. 2 area's with their own bar. Enough toilets, enough lockers, but only cash money. Tokens for drinks available at the entrance. Also it's pretty far out of the centre, since the municipality want to decentralise tourism."
1,Radion, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Professional and friendly employees.
Great atmosphere, i feel always welcome here.
And now they even have howling wolfe beer üê∫ üç∫ ü§©!"
2,Radion, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing place, one of the best parties of my life!!!!"
3,Radion, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It looks like a student's haunt - and is probably quite popular with the local younger generation - but I quite enjoyed this place. ‚Ä¶
4,Radion, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great hip place to eat and drink! Very nice to sit outside on sunny evenings :) the location is a bid random but adds to the vibe. The food is really good, especially considering the prices!"
5,Radion, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"May be one of the best clubs in Amsterdam besides Shelter.
Fantastic location and great people!
Always a night to remember (((d[-_-]b)))"

9,Radion, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really good and fresh food!!! My favorite is Radion Burger- reach flavor, especially  the smoky taste of meat. Highly recommend if your are a burger lover!"
10,Radion, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Fantastic place to enjoy Techno with a great atmosphere and layout.
11,Radion, 1 star ,10 months ago,"Neighborhood place that all of a sudden decides to offer nothing but vegan. Such a shame. They used to serve nice food, so hope the owner sobers up and offers something for everyone. I don‚Äôt mind vegan dishes on a menu, just give us a choice..Especially as there not many nice places arounf."
12,Radion, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Great vibe, prepare for the queue and lockers."
13,Radion, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Low key, non-pretentious water hole. Lots of locals, and mix of all kinds of them. Definitely worth visiting."
14,Radion, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great place to go to have a lunch, dinner and / or drink not to mention great parties in a openminded and safe environment. Definitely a place to be when you are young and looking for something special"
15,Radion, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice place. We were there 17:00-19:30. There were groups of young people sitting for a beer after work, families eating burgers and even people with dogs. Looks like a place for everyone. ‚Ä¶"
16,Radion, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Best club in the city by far.
17,Radion, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best club I have ever been to. Was here for vault sessions closing party at ADE.

18,Radion, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great widespread venue. Attended for the Dutch Decompression party and had a great time.
19,Radion, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Nice club and nice spot surrounding and inside.
20,Radion, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Can't see a thing. Feel everything. I'll go here more often.
21,Radion, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool place in an out-of-the-way location. I've been here twice, and both times the servers were quite unfriendly. Granted, it's quite busy in the evening, but still, it doesn't feel like they're making an effort. They do have good food and a good selection of beer -- and I suppose that's what matters most."
22,Radion, 5 stars ,4 months ago,One of my favourite places to dance
23,Radion, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Techno Club. The music is good and the vibe is there too.
24,Radion, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere, yummy food and snacks, good music. Thanx Bryan!"
25,Radion, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"As an Amsterdam's visitor, i loved this place, the population is open-minded, music programmation excellent (it was a techno party). It's a good place and not very expensive :)"
26,Radion, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there for NYE, there were 3 rooms with different kinds of music. Very specious but the main stage was very hot and sweaty. In general great place but the lockers almost outdoors literally killed me- the temperature amplitude was too big."
27,Radion, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's a large, maze-like venue that hosts a lot of good events. Drinks are reasonably priced and I've heard the food is good when the kitchen is open, but I've never had it. Never had a bad time at Radion"
28,Radion, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a review of the restaurant, not the club!!! Nice atmosphere, though I'm very disappointed there are no tables near the window anymore. I used to sit there and work all day, while enjoying the daylight, which is unfortunately not ‚Ä¶"
29,Radion, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Good breakfast club
30,Radion, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved the place. I found the staired room to be a bit awkward, if I had to point out a negative. Apart from that, everything was perfect. Most of the credit goes to a very competent and approachable staff. I must highlight the security ‚Ä¶"
31,Radion, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Yummy food, tasty drinks, nice music and good atmosphere. The service can improve a bit (parts of the order forgotten and no waiter at the table after first round of drinks), but they are nice and fast. Worth a visit!"
32,Radion, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice to find a place like this in an area that is largely suburban and a bit dull. It's got a great atmosphere, and decent beers. Food could be better (I had a burger there), but by no means bad."
33,Radion, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best place in Amsterdam. People are really nice, food is good and not too expensive! The place is beautiful with good music! Next time we will let you listening french songs! Thanks for that experience. See you the next time we come in Amsterdam! PS : the waitress was really nice with us, it was a pleasure to meet you :)"
34,Radion, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Went here not having a clue about where to eat on our first night in Amsterdam and was not disappointed. We couldn't find it at first as it looked like university accommodation style buildings. When we walked in we were greeted by a really ‚Ä¶
35,Radion, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing vibes - one of the best places for techno sessions! Industrial architecture inside with many corners to sit and relax. Main stage was is fire! Can't wait for the next party!
36,Radion, 1 star ,5 years ago,This place has the potential to be amazing but the utterly dreadful service lets it down. ‚Ä¶
37,Radion, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great bookings. The layout of the club is not my favorite in Amsterdam, but worth it for the music, and preferred outskirts of Centraal. Set back off the road and easy to miss if you don‚Äôt see the sign.  Plenty of bike parking! Nice little garden area to sit outside."
38,Radion, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I came and was very surprise with the place. There's nice food: we ate nachos, burguer and we ate an amazing desert: vanilla ice cream with Oreo cookie and caramel. Surreal. ‚Ä¶"
39,Radion, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Tried going twice before leaving my review. Both times not a good experience. The place has absolutely no ventilation so get ready to pass out in the stinking smell of people's sweat and cigs and just be super hot. I have no idea how a ‚Ä¶
40,Radion, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Some room for improvement (especially price of drinks-wise), but great customer service and the venue is cool (nightclub). Will definitely visit for food soon too."
41,Radion, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place with a good selection of beer and good food. There's also an outside area for the warm dinner evening. A bit on the expensive side though, but there's little what in this area"
42,Radion, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A solid grimy club that‚Äôs open pretty much all night. A great spot if you want an all night session. Security is nice and don‚Äôt bother you too much.
43,Radion, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very bad service in the Radion cafe on Friday night.
Dirty glasses and table, bad draft beer, tasteless.
Bartender told me they had a busy day.... ‚Ä¶"
44,Radion, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Yes!! Nice asset to the neighbourhood! Amazing parties in Berlin-esque ambiance, dark hallways, great sound, getting lost and dance the night away! During the day / evening they have this gran caf√© which is excellent for a simple, tastefull bite!"
45,Radion, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing club by night, caf√©, terrasse and conference space by day. Radion has a 24-hour license so you can dance all night and day if you want (check the Weekenders events).Don't forget to go downstairs and buy some glitters ‚ú®"
46,Radion, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I experienced Radion as a club and it was so much fun. The staff was incredibly kind and interesting. It had really dancey techno music with a perfect layout for small and large groups. I definitely recommend going
47,Radion, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Perfect for if you don't want your Amsterdam experience to end at 5:00 a.m. ""already"". Friendly staff (that includes the bouncers!!), great atmosphere and mostly just people completely lost in music. Also great for (summer)festival afterparties!"
48,Radion, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"What the F*** happened to this place? In april we had the best meals possible! Delish salmon with even better tasting veggies, my friends had sky high burgers, parel gerst (?), pizza's and steak. The desserts were to die for!! Ofcourse I ‚Ä¶"
49,Radion, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Always nice to visit and not expensive. The Party people are good crowd, bar staff friendly, wide spread of different groups of people."
50,Radion, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"How clubs are supposed to be: fantastic sound, great line ups, impressive industrial space, late licenses. Don't let the distance from Centrum put you off, it just means the dancefloor is only full of people who want to be there, music ‚Ä¶"
51,Radion, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome venue which feels like a maze.
52,Radion, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great place, alternative vibe.
Vegan friendly"
53,Radion, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious burgers! The Angus burger And falafel burger are amazing! Large portion of fries and the burgers are big as well. The pizzas and main courses are only served after 17:00.
54,Radion, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly place, decent beer selection. A bit hard to find. Really quiet when I was there on a Saturday afternoon, expected it busier."
55,Radion, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Went for the Dekmantel after party. So rubbish that all their smoking areas are indoors. Makes room 1 so boiling. Room 2 is much better if you can find it!
56,Radion, 5 stars ,4 years ago,i had a big party here. i stayed there for a long time. The place is great. it give the feels like a Berlin club . i think is one of the best clubs in Amsterdam ! you should defently go there when there is a party goin on
57,Radion, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"RADION is awesome! Apart from the curious bouncers and the small lockers, the only disappointment here is that Cucumis is not available at the bar anymore. Bring it back!"
58,Radion, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice venue for alternative parties. Several cool rooms to explore. Too bad there aren't enough toilets and people smoke inside everywhere
59,Radion, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely staff and good food
60,Radion, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"If you're going to be open for 24 hours try playing some interesting music in the meantime. My mother's living room has a better lighting rig, too."
