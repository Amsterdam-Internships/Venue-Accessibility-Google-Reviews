0,Men Impossible, 5 stars ,a month ago,I've never tried vegan ramen before but this was definitely not going to be my last time. It was interesting to try and it was surprisingly very delicious. The ramen has a strong taste but not overwhelming. We've got some small dishes as well and everything was really good.

36,Men Impossible, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Booked the place without knowing its 100 vegan.  The starters were truly one of the best. The amaze men, however is not something you should get if ur expecting ramen. Although flavor was good, after the first few bites, it was bit too creamy and ""vegan"" for me."

49,Men Impossible, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I really like the concept. The chef is very friendly. The place is very cosy and original. Great fit if you are vegan/vegeterian. Pick the Beginner menu if you wanna taste all starters. The ramen could be less saucy but still very tasty. üëç

158,Men Impossible, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Definitely somewhere to check out for Dutch cuisine. The food was what one might call rustic and simple but satisfying. I had a very relaxing lunch with my family. I enjoyed a lovely dinner at Moeder‚Äôs whilst on holiday in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶

183,Men Impossible, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty and special,  but not what I expected from Ramen. The owner is extremely nice and the atmosphere was friendly and intimate. The vegan ramen was not the usual broth-based ramen that Ali know but a thicker type. Very filling as well."
184,Men Impossible, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Dishing out gorgeous, vegan ramens that are every bit as rich and satisfying as their carnivorous counterparts, Chef Atsushi has truly done the impossible. But that's not the only way he defines human limits: he runs the entire restaurant ‚Ä¶"
