2,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Visited De Italian in December 2018

Very accessible from tram 17 located on a beautiful street. ‚Ä¶"
3,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Hands down, one of the best pizzas I ever had! All in all a very nice evening. They actually did not have a free table outside, but went out of their way to carry an extra one out for us - thanks a lot! :)"
4,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This experience was Amazing... Beautiful flavours in every meal.
I recommend Primavera Pizza, full of color and great taste, all ingredients were fresh, big pizza for good price... Enjoy their pasta too, is incredible the ingredients they use preparing their delicious meal."
5,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great cosy italian restaurant on the cosiest street in Amsterdam. This restaurant is a must, very popular so make a reservation otherwise you might have to wait a while for a table. But it's worth the waiting. Great food and service. A place where the locals go to."
6,De Italiaan, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Good GF pizza, terrific tiramisu. Too bad for the very long wait to get our pizzas (1h15). The welcome could be more friendly‚Ä¶"
7,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best place nowadays for lunch or an early dinner. Daily specials, fish/meat/veggie and of course a great pizza, pasta menu. Tiramisu and scroppino to wrap it up!"
8,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best meal we had in Amsterdam. Very tender ossobucco, pasta done al dente, and a very interesting dessert - Sgroppino.  (Lemon sorbet, vodka, and spumante in a narrow sundae glass. ‚Ä¶"
9,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,3 months ago,I've been here at least 4 times in the past 6 months. Delicious gluten free pizza
10,De Italiaan, 4 stars ,4 years ago,This was exactly what we were after. Somewhere warm and cosy that sold wheat free pizza. The pizza wasn‚Äôt incredibly but it hit the spot! Very friendly staff and got the best seat next to the window. Had the most amazing Italian wine as well. Would definitely go back!
11,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Must visit while in Amsterdam. De Italiaan is in one of the most beautiful streets of Amsterdam and serves terrific Italian food, wines and drinks."
12,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Great food in a great atmosphere. The pizza with Truffel oil is a must try.
13,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Absolutely delicious choice of food, great atmosphere and attentive service! They also serve gluten-free dishes which made me even more happy and satisfied!"
14,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cosy corner location with a romantic feel. The pasta regano was delicious. Staff were friendly and attentive. Thought it was quite pricey though I still recommend.
15,De Italiaan, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Service was non existent. The servers pretty much slammed plates on the table. Forgot asparagus for us. Then just brought it out during dessert time..one of the weirdest experience I have had in a while. Food was not that great either.
16,De Italiaan, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Tried once. Kind service and good wine selection, but that's it - dining is unfortunately an inauthentic and disappointing/average experience, and also over-priced. ‚Ä¶"
17,De Italiaan, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a great little place! As you walk in the smell of pizza and amazing cheese is just another level!
Nice and cosy! Sat in the window. And watched the world go by! ‚Ä¶"
18,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This is my local pizza place and I love it.  Staff are always welcoming, the menu has its core staples that don't change and they rotate some new pizzas every once in a while which keeps the menu fresh.  Its a good pizza made with good ‚Ä¶"

22,De Italiaan, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Awesome pizza, but we have waited 80 minutes to get it done... Sorry, but this is unbearable"
23,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Best pizza in Amsterdam and has plenty of gluten free options
24,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great service lovely food üçï gluten free options too!
25,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Gluten free pizza! Good one too. Only place we could find gluten free pizza in Amsterdam.
26,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great Italian food and service. One of my favorite spots in Amsterdam
27,De Italiaan, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good quality gluten free meal, I couldn't believe how much they offered for gluten free. Best gluten free pizza I've had before. One of the dishes was really salty (burn your tongue salty) for which they apologised but didn't change ‚Ä¶"
28,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Fantastic pizza, I will be back"
29,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good service. Great pizza,probably the best we ever had."
30,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service, excellent wine selection and delicious pizza. They do gluten-free pizza which was surprisingly crunchy, thin and delicious! Sadly don‚Äôt have a picture but they are a good size although a bit price as they use fresh ingredients (I suppose)."
31,De Italiaan, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Fake Italian place that caters to the local palate. Stereotypical flavour combinations. Overpriced and underwhelming. Linguini alle vongole was pasta from a packet, still stuck together from careless preparation. For authentic Neapolitan pizza, walk 5 mins to Nnea - a place run by actual Italians who aren‚Äôt motivated by profit."
32,De Italiaan, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great and tasty food and friendly staff. Gluten-free pizza possible and very nice!
A few hick ups: there are some other gluten-free options but not very many. For ‚Ä¶"
33,De Italiaan, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Sweet people, very decent food. Especially if you have gluten free people in your party, they even serve gluten free pasta upon request.  Their service can be spotty, but that's mostly due to lack of staff than anything else. At had a great lunch here."
34,De Italiaan, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Pizza tasted good, the people were nice, wine was great... but I don‚Äôt recommend it to people with celiac disease. Somehow they manage to contaminated it even if they offer gluten free pizza baked separately from the others and because of that I spend the evening at the apartment."
35,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great, AMAZING food. Catered for gluten and dairy free needs, they cook the gluten free pizzas in a separate ovens. Really understanding of allergy requests!
The sheep's cheese with honey was üëå ‚Ä¶"
36,De Italiaan, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Great service, good ambiance but WORST gluten free pizzas!

37,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Absolutely amazing food!
38,De Italiaan, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good gluten free pizza, really crounchy. But except for that, it's not worthed. A Gluten free pizza that is less than half of the size of the normal one, and still you pay two euros more just for the pasta of the pizza. And also for the ‚Ä¶"
39,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So great. The place is full so people seem to like it. Sometimes people are right. I had a pizza that was just great. The name was S.P.Q.R., harhar. Very big. With Anchovies. ‚Ä¶"
40,De Italiaan, 3 stars ,4 years ago,There is the option to sit outside or inside and they have space heaters and blankets which was really nice. ‚Ä¶
41,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As a gluten intolerant traveler, sometimes it‚Äôs hard to find places with gluten free options, even harder to find restaurants that make you forget you aren‚Äôt eating gluten. I‚Äôve been in Amsterdam for 5 days and have come back for a third ‚Ä¶"
42,De Italiaan, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"great food, lovey wine and amazing service, the waitress (owner?) was SO attentive, helpful and cheerful. really made the experience so nice for me, my husband and my mum. will definitely be back."
43,De Italiaan, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Pizzas were good. But the wait to get the food was just inacceptable. More than 1 hour to get 3 pizzas and 2 pasta dishes. No apologies from the staff, only ‚Äúit‚Äôs busy tonight‚Äù. When we asked to split the bill, the guy taking care of us rolled his eyes at us."
44,De Italiaan, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Service was good and the food was good.
45,De Italiaan, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The waiting time is very long!
The food (pizza quattro formaggi/ 4 cheese) was good but you would expect more for the price. ‚Ä¶"
46,De Italiaan, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I like this little spot, a little buzzing area hidden away. The pizza's were good quality, if a little overpriced. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Great to see the gluten free options too."
47,De Italiaan, 1 star ,2 years ago,Took 1 hour to get our entrees while other tables got their food and left.  No excuse!  Then they claimed the dishes we ordered take longer- Wrong - cheese pizza and a simple pasta dish. Never said sorry.  Rude to us on way out too for asking about the delay.
48,De Italiaan, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Pizza is decent, but the pasta.. yikes! Lamb ragu so fatty it sits on you for days. Even messed up their arrabbiata with a rogue dollop of green pesto & a *freezing* old mozzarella ball!? Weird combos."
49,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,a year ago,Ordered two pizzas to go: the Parmigiana and the Boscaiola which were both delicious. Would definitely recommend and will definitely order again soon!
50,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice cozy location with fantastic italian-style pizzas. Quite romantic spot by the candle light - and one tip: book in advance!! It becomes quite popular for dinner. ‚Ä¶

52,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Simpley amazing food and friendly service.
53,De Italiaan, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice Italian restaurant. I always enjoy the pizzas, but pasta are also good. Nice selection of Italian wines. Cosy atmosphere inside, and great terrace as well in summer"
54,De Italiaan, 3 stars ,a year ago,They made a (Little) mistake with the gluten free option we ordered. Lovely to get a glas of wine on the house. Too bad we never got it :(
55,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was amazing, but we had to wait about an hour for two plates of pasta.. The staff was very friendly and they gave us free wine and bread to apologize! We would come back"
56,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The salami pizza is and has always been amazing. I am still trying to find a restaurant close to home (or anywhere I go) that has sich a nicely balanced pizza!

Consistently great"

63,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very good pasta and Italian vine
64,De Italiaan, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The pizza bases were nice and crispy but the toppings could do with a little move flavour. The home made tiramisu was pretty good.
65,De Italiaan, 1 star ,3 years ago,The staff were so rude when my husband and I were trying to get a table to eat. She laughed at my request for a table for two and when I asked about take away she said that they would not do that. My husband and I did have reservations but she was so rude that we decided to dine elsewhere.
66,De Italiaan, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent food! Our hostess Catline was warm, friendly and attentive. Very cosy setting. The Gnocchi is not to be missed."
