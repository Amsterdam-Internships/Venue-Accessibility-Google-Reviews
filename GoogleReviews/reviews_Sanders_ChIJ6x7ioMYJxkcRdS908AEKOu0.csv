0,Sanders, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was good. The lunch time menu... I got exactly what it said on the menu, but I'm not sure if croquettes should go in between two plain slices of bread. I thought there would be more to it. It's probably just my preference, but I didn't like it very much sorry! The greasy burger looked better."
1,Sanders, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent food and great location by the bridge, however the service was very slow even there were less than 5 tables, staff was not very attentive."
2,Sanders, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was okay. I got the steak and ordered medium but came out rare. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice, as you can look out to the canal."

6,Sanders, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Big portions and great atmosphere.
7,Sanders, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Just popped in for a beer in the afternoon. Very nice place with friendly staff. It was quiet but it is next to a university building so is probably very busy in the evening.

10,Sanders, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"the place was nice and cozy, quiet on tuesday evening. The service was nice and fast. But the food was very bad. We had classic burger and coq au vin and while the burger was okay, the chicken had no taste whatsoever. The sauce in which it …"

12,Sanders, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Service was very warm and friendly though on the slower side. Opted for the ham & cheese tosti (€3.50) and tomato soup (€4.50), both on the small lunch menu. Soup was hearty with a thicker texture then usual for this type and was well …"
13,Sanders, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Food was super tasty and large portions. Prices pretty decent too. Service was very slow. Only 2 tables and it took 45 minutes for us to get our egg orders.
14,Sanders, 2 stars ,4 years ago,the cocktails (espresso martini & white russian) are good. the food is super disgusting. we had the nachos and the fried platter. nachos had dried (old?) cheese on it and the fried platter was actually just fried balls with something in it …
15,Sanders, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Never again! Great music and food selection but sanitation is a deal breaker! The staff allowed a guy to bring in his dog (a golden retriever) who proceeded to roam unattended and scratch fleas in an eating establishment. PASS.
