1,De Spiegel, 5 stars ,a month ago,"All coffee is excellent, biscuits is the best. I loved biscuits üòö"
2,De Spiegel, 5 stars ,a week ago,"The waiter Tim is a legend, best service ever. He was really welcoming and helpful with us in our trip to Amsterdam. We definitely recommend and we'll be back only if he's working!"

6,De Spiegel, 5 stars ,7 months ago,A nice place to grab some snacks or coffee. Very friendly and responsive staff. Check if there is a free table on the boat.
7,De Spiegel, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Location and food I had no issues with, but the older server who works here has a terrible attitude and was incredibly rude. This was my last stop whilst in Amsterdam and thanks to this server I will probably not visit this cafe nor the city ever again."
