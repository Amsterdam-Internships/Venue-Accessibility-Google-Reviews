0,De Zotte, 1 star ,4 months ago,"The place was too crowded. The staff was not helpful, they looked too busy even to listen to us. The food wasn't great. At the end the lady at the till told me that I couldn't pay by debit card because in the Netherlands they don't accept visa or MasterCard. ( That was not correct as I paid everywhere with the same cards )."
1,De Zotte, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent Dutch restaurant with nice vibe inside. The staff is super nice, friendly and speak English. The food is amazing and the portion size is more than enough. It has the authentic Dutch taste and loved it. However, the toilet seemed ‚Ä¶"
2,De Zotte, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"My favourite bar in Amsterdam! A great vibe, superb selection of beers and friendly staff. ‚Ä¶"
3,De Zotte, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"This is one of my favourite hidden gems in the city center. The location on a back street makes it less crowded than other places at the expense of not having a terrace. Very good selection of beers and the food is tasty, the type you would expect from a cafe in Amsterdam. This is the place where I see myself becoming a regular."
4,De Zotte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic Belgium beer cafe with a huge selection of beers and a small food menu. Would recommend this to anyway who is a fan of special beer. Staff is knowledgeable and can advice what to drink.
5,De Zotte, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Cozy place just a block or two down from Melkweg and Leidseplein. Lots of Belgian beers on the menu as well as food. I had the ‚ÄúDish of the Day‚Äù which was duck and enjoyed it.  Will definitely be back.
6,De Zotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Stopped in here randomly, we were looking for a place to eat and thought it looked perfect. We were right on! One woman running the whole deal with someone in the back cooking. She was a total boss too, and really nice as soon as we could ‚Ä¶"
7,De Zotte, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Cozy place, there are several tables outside.

21,De Zotte, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great variety of beers! Although a few were not available. Asked for my burger to be medium done, got it well done. Wasn't worth the hassle if returning it. Tasted good though"

24,De Zotte, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great beer selection, good food, and a cosy atmosphere. It gets crowded after 18:00, so make a reservation if you want a table. It's a tight space, so four is a good group size but six is pushing it. In general, there's only one person ‚Ä¶"
25,De Zotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Must visit place for the lovers of Belgium beer. Huge amount of different bottles and several ones on tap.
26,De Zotte, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Located on the quieter street, wide selection of beers and tasty food"
27,De Zotte, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A great and unique selection of Belgian Beers, one my favorite Belgian spots in Amsterdam. They also serve good steaks, and occasionally they have the rib-eye. You should definitely give it a try. ‚Ä¶"
28,De Zotte, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice Belgian pub - not many beers on tap, but significant bottled variety. Some food too, bitterballen are quite good. Overall it's a place of a vibe though, and the vibe is great!"
29,De Zotte, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Way overpriced! And the high prices come with attitude. Staff was incompetent and standard Belgium beers almost twice as expensive as in other bars in Amsterdam... The interior is great, it has soul. It's a pity they sold itl."
30,De Zotte, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We paid ‚Ç¨ 72 (3 people) for no meal. We asked twice (at different moments) whether our meals would be ready in time, because we had to leave for the theatre; twice they said it would be OK. But it took a long time and we were getting ‚Ä¶"
31,De Zotte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I nice small pub serving a lot of great different beers a couple of minutes behind Leidseplein. They have a special beer glass for every brand but keep in mind that not all beer brands are always in stock so better check the beer list. Service is great and they help you choose a nice beer.
32,De Zotte, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"This is a gem of a place. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. My wife and I split the steak and black bread and farmers cheese plate. Everything was too delicious to describe in words. Additionally, the selection of Belgian beers in this ‚Ä¶"
33,De Zotte, 5 stars ,8 years ago,This is one of the very best Belgian beer bars in Amsterdam and one of my favorites. So many good beers and such nice people. You can smoke when it's late so if you don't like that leave earlier. The food is good. The beers are great and they play good music! Busy days you should book a table.
34,De Zotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This bar has a very local feel. Many beers to choose from with equally variety of serving glasses. I only had the appetizers during my visit and they where delicious. I of course highly recommend bitterballen.
35,De Zotte, 3 stars ,5 years ago,I really like the place the staff is great and the beers are great! But.... the only thing that makes it three stars is that the food is changed since last time I bin here. I'm a qualified chef and with every bite I took of mine steak I ‚Ä¶
36,De Zotte, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great choice is Belgian beers, Nice staff. The food is coming with some delay, but tasty. Meal size is somewhere in the lower side of the spectrum."
37,De Zotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food; I always thought this was a real meat-eater place, BUT: they also have a lot of ( really excellent! ) VEGAN options. For instance; the vegan Satay... marvellous. Love it. ‚Ä¶"
38,De Zotte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere, lively bar off the main streets. Great selection of draught and bottled beers (Kwak amber is fantastic) small menu but that's as it should be. Go for the Dutch cheese plate with hot fresh country bread and spicy beer sausage on the side."
39,De Zotte, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The bar as a whole is a quite good location. The interior looks really good and fits the style of the bar. The amount of beers is great, even with a house brand. When we were there they couple of times said they don't have the alcohol we ‚Ä¶"
40,De Zotte, 4 stars ,3 years ago,This is a great place to have a n authentic beer in Amsterdam.  The staff is quite rude and not caring but really what do you expect from student bar staff who drink for free. It's not accesible for wheelchair users.
41,De Zotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Such an excellent bar! A classic Dutch/Belgian bar vibe and just round the corner from leidseplein. Come here rather than drinking at those tourist traps (and that's coming from a tourist). The barman was a genuinely sweet guy and very ‚Ä¶
42,De Zotte, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Smallish place. Not very good service. Asked the bar maid about Belgian sour beers. She said they didn't have any but on the way out I saw that they had 4 different ones. On a nice evening you want to sit outside but there's only two seats on the sidewalk that are always taken.
43,De Zotte, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Good food, better beer, & great atmosphere. What more do u need?!  Gets busy and had the 1 waitress was on her own to tend to the whole place. Loved the bar cat that greeted everyone."
44,De Zotte, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice intimate bar close to Leidseplein but not overcrowded. Beer is a bit expensive but the food isn't. Their Trappist cheese platter was abundant and very tasty.
45,De Zotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The other photos show the place well.  Where I come from this would be a dive bar...but where I come from, dive bars don't have such a great menu and beer selection.  Steak poivre (tender steak medium rare with pepper) and muscles in wine ‚Ä¶"
46,De Zotte, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great brewery, with a huge selection (over 140), mostly belgian, but also a nice place for dinner. Small and cosy, with low ilumination. Their menu is quite reduced but the dishes surprisingly tasty for a place where the main focus is on ‚Ä¶"
47,De Zotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came to Amsterdam with my girlfriend and walked Into de zotte by accident. Came back every night since. The food was outstanding. One of the best steaks we have ever had. Martyne is so hospitable and made us feel very welcome. Great price and even greater food. Highly recommended
48,De Zotte, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Cosy Belgian beer caf√©. Decent selection, though nothing really surprising on the menu."
49,De Zotte, 5 stars ,5 years ago,One of the best Belgian beer bars in Amsterdam. Good selection of beers in a brown caf√© atmosphere. They have decent food if you come early.
50,De Zotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Superb neighborhood eatery and the beer list is extensive.  We eat at De Zotte many many times when we visit, this year for a month.  A pic of us is even on Google that someone took of us Oct '18. We were sitting at the very front table and ‚Ä¶"
51,De Zotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome little Belgian beer bar tucked away in one of the side-streets of Amsterdam! The atmosphere is the best - local, welcoming to tourists, and with the nicest beers one can hope for!"
52,De Zotte, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Undoubtedly one of the best Belgian bars in Amsterdam. Every time we are in Amsterdam we make sure to have a few beers and some bitterballen in de Zotte. The staff is really knowledgeable about their beers, and each brand has a custom glass, as expected in a Belgian bar."
53,De Zotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best damn Belgian bar I've been to in forever. Service was fantastic, food was delicious. Super accommodating to us Americans. :)"
54,De Zotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great selection of beers and good food. Good place to go for something to eat and stick around for a couple of hours. Don't forget to kiss the cook.
55,De Zotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super friendly staff, amazing cozy atmosphere (with a rockers vibe) and an amazing belgian craft cider with a very good looking menu as well! 10/10 would go again"
56,De Zotte, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very cosy and characterful Belgian beer bar serving decent food. Tucked away from the main touristy square (Leidesplein) nearby. Handy for pre and post gig beers if you're going to Melkweg!
57,De Zotte, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Super cozy bar with lots of beers and really nice snacks
58,De Zotte, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"My wife and I stumble upon this place while in town for our anniversary. Very friendly staff, amazing beer, tasty bitterballen and a cosy atmosphere. We went on a Sunday evening so it wasn't too busy. Loved it."
59,De Zotte, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Good selection of Belgian beers. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. A cosy, but small and crowded place, so there's always a chance of not getting in."

64,De Zotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent bar and great food! Super top spot! And all the great beers you never tasted yet!
65,De Zotte, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Very loud music and quite crowded. Food was decent. Selection of beers is very average and expensive. Of all the craft beer places in Amsterdam this one I enjoyed the least.

We ordered a plate with cheese and bread which was pretty expensive and we were a little disappointed so,  i dont recommend the food.  But the beers were great."
67,De Zotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great selection of belgian beers, tiny place but interesting. Music can be loud sometimes which is not ok if you want to have a nice conversation"

70,De Zotte, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Lots of specialty beers, knowledgeable and kind staff. Very nice place to sit and relax. It's not a huge place, so it's not always easy to find a table."
71,De Zotte, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Interesting spot, good beer but would not recommend the food. Cozy atmosphere and good spot, just off Leidseplein (one of the most crowded places in Amsterdam) and still quiet and somehow special."
72,De Zotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing place for belgian beer. The staff is friendly and helpful. You get good option of veg/non-vegetarian food as well.

74,De Zotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fell through this place during New year's Eve and although our party was quite  ""happy"" the bartender was really nice and understanding! Can recommend!"
75,De Zotte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If you are looking for Belgium beer in Amsterdam, this is a great spot. The Trappist beer sampler is fantastic, but the ABVs of the beers make it not for the faint of heart"
76,De Zotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty beers (and a surprisingly nice cheese platter), while the ambience is perfect for both a get-together with friends or looking down the glass alone."

79,De Zotte, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Nice place in the center of the city. It's usually crowded. It's a great option to go out for a drink, good beers. In general an interesting bar to hang out, but not the best option for dinner"
80,De Zotte, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The best place to find great Belgian Brew
81,De Zotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great spot for a good beer selection & a surprisingly vegan friendly pub menu. Ambiance is always lovely.

89,De Zotte, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Truly one of Amsterdam's finest bars. To the best of my knowledge, the only one to serve La Corne. If you thought the Kwak glass was the apotheosis of imbibing vessels, think again."

91,De Zotte, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Cool bar, with a huge choice of high-quality beers. However, drinks are extremely expensive and there is really little space where to fit the crowd."

93,De Zotte, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Great atmosphere and selection of beers. The food is also very good...well worth a stop when you are in Amsterdam!
94,De Zotte, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Excellent Belgium beer bar. Only problem is that it's too crowded. Possibly they could make it bigger or get better sound isolation.
