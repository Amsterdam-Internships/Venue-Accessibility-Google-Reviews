0,Pont 13, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"I went there for a work dinner, we had a 3 course meal, very tasty. The dessert was not as great as the other dishes but still tasty. There was another group at an adjacent table and it was a bit noisy, but still very good. I will go again. It could be great in summer if outdoor seating is possible."
1,Pont 13, 3 stars ,5 months ago,I loved the environment than I did the food. Not much options to choose from but very serene area.
2,Pont 13, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, unique atmosphere of a decommissioned ferry. When we arrived, we were greeted by the welcome scent of smoked food in their large, wood-burning stove and an airy space with very high ceilings. All the food was good and I'd return for the experience, probably in warmer weather when we can sit outside and enjoy the water views."
3,Pont 13, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The atmosphere was awesome. Food and service great and location cool! Definitely worth checking out. They cater for all diets too.
4,Pont 13, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely stunning establishment. The food was really tasty and the service was great too. Only complaints would be that it's a long walk out of the centre and that between serving the 'lunch' and 'dinner' menus all that was available for ‚Ä¶
5,Pont 13, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing, cozy, great food. If you want to get away from the city and relax by the water, look no further. The decor inside is really out of a movie. So tasteful, original furniture, floor, fixtures, lighting. The surprise of it all is that it's cheap. Go crazy!"
6,Pont 13, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The restournat is in an old ferry, the same ones that take people from Central Station to North. I had the pontburger which was very good, they also have vegetarian and vegan options available for certain dishes. The staff was very nice as well."

12,Pont 13, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It was very quiet as we were there on a Wednesday in September, but it was absolutely lovely. The food was excellent and the staff friendly. Eating on a boat with a nice view on the water is definitely a plus. The neighbourhood is still a work in progress, but still nice. I would definitely recommend it."

14,Pont 13, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great to have lunch at an old Amsterdam Ferry and always good to be surrounded by water. It is great to see the history. The menu is not extensive but you have all what you need. Service was great and there is enough space to feel safe in this 1,5 mtr society."
15,Pont 13, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is an epic flouting restaurant. It's an old bout docked in a quiet harbour. I just love the vibe in this restaurant. I really like this place, especially in the summer time. Ideal restaurant to go in couple or just to hangout with ‚Ä¶"

20,Pont 13, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Nice place close to the water. On warm days kids are swimming around.
21,Pont 13, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place for lunch or dinner. The area doesn‚Äôt have that many options yet and this is an interesting place. It can get a little noisy at times though.
Food is good and a little less expensive than the nearby REM island, which has the same owner I believe."
22,Pont 13, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Been here a few times for lunch and service was usually on the slow side, but still acceptable. Today I went there with my wife at 1pm for a simple sandwich. We had to wait about 20 minutes before our order was even taken. We  both ordered ‚Ä¶"

26,Pont 13, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"One of my favorite places for summer in Amsterdam. Last year it was closed in the winter. It is located on a big boat, offering a great open air atmosphere. You may even sit down for a coffee during the day, or dinner later on. They also have a nice interior, if it gets chilly. Food was also very good and staff was friendly too."

30,Pont 13, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"A restaurant on a boat! Amazing food and wines with great service.  Make sure to book a table in advance as it gets quite busy.  It's best to get a taxi there as it's a bit of a hike from the city centre.  Say hi to Storm, the dog - he walks around like he owns the place! :-)"
31,Pont 13, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Incredibly good food but above all an amazing atmosphere. The interior ties in with the entire experience of eating at Pont 13. It's a bit out of the way but make sure you try the smoked T-bone steak.
32,Pont 13, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Located on an old ferry that has been transformed into a restaurant and bar. The interior of the boat/restaurant is industrial and the view you have over the water is really beautiful.

50,Pont 13, 4 stars ,3 years ago,If you work in the area this place is a nice getaway for lunch. Yummy sandwiches but a small food and drink selection in general.
51,Pont 13, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Delicious fish, superb location. I like the fact you first have to go through this industrial area and you think ""Are we going the right way?""  until all of sudden you find this gem."
