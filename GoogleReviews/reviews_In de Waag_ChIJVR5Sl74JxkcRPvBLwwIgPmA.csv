0,In de Waag, 5 stars ,a month ago,Wonderful restaurant for dinner or a relaxing tea time. Great for a date night or with friends. The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious. They have a wide range of dishes and drinks. The deco is very cozy and the atmosphere is lovely. They even apologised for the inconvenience of only having one toilet.
1,In de Waag, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Sunday street market on the Nieuwmarkt square during Summer from May to the end of October. Any day De Waag, a medieval building, now a restaurant. Nice area in the centre of Amsterdam."
2,In de Waag, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Nice place for a coffee or snack.  Cafe has good Options.  Nice history too.
3,In de Waag, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Excellent experience. Service was very good and the food was very enjoyable as well. All in all, definitely a reason to go back"
4,In de Waag, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"The place is beautiful, and with a pleasant atmosphere. The waiter was very nice and helpful and switched to Spanish when he heard us talking. The 3 stars are for the food, very expensive for the quality you receive. Also for the dirty toilets."
5,In de Waag, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Very warm and cozy. It was rainy and we came to get warmer.
The building is amazing.
They have good cheesecake. …"
6,In de Waag, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Great place to visit when being a tourist in Amsterdam! The candles play a lot in the positive mark of this place. It is very nice to be surrounded by so many candles. Food and staff is very nice, the beer a little overpriced but OK overall."
7,In de Waag, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"In de waag: The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere and looks really nice! Food was stunning even if the size of the Flamekuech was a bit disappointing. ( anyway for twelve euros, it was enough in term of price/quality ). The waitress …"
8,In de Waag, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This is a nice location right in the middle of a small farmers market. They had a good selection of food. We got croquettes, bitterballen, focaccia with goat cheese and balsamic, and cheese sticks. Everything was very yummy and the service was fast and friendly! Plus, the building is gorgeous."
9,In de Waag, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"The least favourite place I’ve visited in Amsterdam. If you ask starter and main, they will bring both together and will act as if its your fault. Service overall was not great, probably because it’s popular because of the location. I would avoid this place, you probably find better options across the street."
10,In de Waag, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Location awesome, service overloaded but super nice, food great (steak was a little chewy)"
11,In de Waag, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had an amazing experience at this place. It is situated right in the middle of a market and very hard to miss being such a big castle :-) Ambience inside was lively with candles lit all over the place. …

15,In de Waag, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The Waag is the old weighing house from the time of the Dutch golden age, a relic of a rich past. Now, it is a building which houses a restaurant with the accompanying patio laid out directly outside. The Waag is a good landmark to find yourself as it is in the center of Newmarkt square."
16,In de Waag, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice atmosphere and the food wasn't bad, but expensive (as can be expected from the location alone). They also messed up our orders and consecutively the shared group tab, but couldn't tell us which items we supposedly hadn't paid for."

27,In de Waag, 2 stars ,4 months ago,The food was good but service was horrible. We even gave up on ordering desert. It just took forever and ruined the whole experience.
28,In de Waag, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is spectacular! In such a cool and unique location, I was a little worried about how the food would be, but trust me and other reviews, this place is a must when in Amsterdam, and that’s without even discussing how cool the …"
29,In de Waag, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I mean, it's a restaurant in a small castle! What else could you ask for? They have good coffee, good beer, great food!

my feeling."
31,In de Waag, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I was there for a beer and a snack. Got some good beer, and a simple snack of cheese and olives. Not much choice. Service was OK, on the slow side. Surprising given the place was empty. It's a nice environment for a beer or coffee."
32,In de Waag, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Unusual building in the middle of the ""square"".
The food was very good as was the service. Interesting decor, a lot of candles provide lighting augmented by traditional lights. …"

185,In de Waag, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is good but portions are small. The staff aren't too smart on their feet and neglect large areas of the guests. That said, the decor is great with a fantastic location. It's worth going, just don't expect the service to match the good taste."

268,In de Waag, 3 stars ,3 years ago,They were really slow and tastewise not worth it. Only the food decoration was good for their lunch burger. The coleslaw as the salsa and the ketchup were much too sweet!!!!

290,In de Waag, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was slow at the beginning, but picked up once the staff realised. After that the service was friendly and punctual, and the food was great!

297,In de Waag, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food is above the average tourist rubbish and the service is best described as haphazard.  Waving your fingers in front of me while talking to your colleague is not part of the service experience I was looking for.
298,In de Waag, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice restaurant placed in the historical town gate of Amsterdam. Nice and fitting interior. Good food and drinks. In the summer the outdoor tables are a great place to get a glimpse at the city life while you enjoy a fine dinner.

322,In de Waag, 1 star ,4 years ago,A real disaster the service!!! The food is nice! The food guy cannot coordinate with the wine guy so you never received your dish with your wine! Tooooo late every dish! Mistaken check! And essential bad cosr/service! Be careful!

341,In de Waag, 1 star ,3 years ago,TOURIST TRAP!! terrible food followed with mediocre service. Was given the wrong bill with 100 euros over. She was even going to swipe the card until we questioned the bill. Steak tartare was one of the worst very bland. Steak was dry and unseasoned. Waste of a meal and no one should go back!!!!!

365,In de Waag, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place for a brunch. Cost atmosphere. The mediocre eggs Benedict leaves you wanting. The poached eggs were perfect but the hollandaise disappoints as well as the lack of proper ham.
