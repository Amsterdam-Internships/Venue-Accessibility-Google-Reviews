0,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,a month ago,"A fun and easy dinner location. They have a large gin menu and the mussels are good. The service is really good though - both servers we met went above and beyond and were smiley and friendly. We sat outside on the terrace, we were worried ‚Ä¶"
1,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Mussels perfectly cooked. Mussels were on the large side, and they were juicy. The options we tried was the Roquefort and the mustard versions. Both Roquefort and mustard are strongly flavored, so we were slightly wary that they would ‚Ä¶"

3,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great food; friendly and professional service; gin tonic are really tasty as the food. I definitely recommend to have a dinner in this special restaurant
4,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great cocktails and a nice choice Mussels with different sauces. If you enjoy different Gin based cocktails, highly recommend."
5,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,8 months ago,We love this place - the service is just unbeatable! Everyone who works there is really nice and welcoming and the food is just so comforting. Mussels were so good! Highly recommend the Thai coconut and cheese mussels. One of my favorite places in Amsterdam.
6,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,a year ago,Really nice atmosphere. It's quite a small restaurant but it is on two floors so in these Covid-19 troubled times it means it is quite spacious and cosy due to social-distancing. We found the staff to be friendly and efficient. I for one ‚Ä¶
7,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,9 months ago,Crowded place but everything is done so that tables are set apart. Great outdoor space with the parc around! The food was a bit disappointing for the price (20‚Ç¨ for a mussel main): the mussels were not actually cooked in the sauce (I picked ‚Ä¶
8,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I really liked the food there. We've ordered one mussels pot for couple with some sides and it was plenty enough. Everything ordered there was fresh, tasty and delivered to the table in a record time. I'll definitely come back once I have a chance to visit Amsterdam again."
9,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice and friendly Service, delicious Oysters and the Mango infused, Chili Pepper Gin Tonic was amazing."
10,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"As usual, best mussels and gin in town. Incomparable service and friendliness, I truly believe they have one of the best service in the world! So it had to be Mussel and Gin for our very first outing after the restaurants lockdown. Thank you for a wonderful time and keep up the great work guys!"
11,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"We tried the Thai mussels and the classic, loved both but the Thai was more delicious. We got gin mayo with our order which we could take with us. Service was friendly yet not intrusive"
12,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice and cozy place.  Delicious Vegan option, that was unfortunately not present on the menu, but if you ask a waitress\waiter they gladly assist and check with chefs. Very good cocktails too. Satisfied and will come back for sure."
13,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best dinner i had in amsterdam. Lovely stuff, great decoration and location. We had pulp which was very good, mussel classic very delicious and scallop which was a bit salty. They have a wide range of gin&tonic menu. I got pomegranate and rose very fresh. Average price per person 25 euros"
14,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect place for a good dinner and some really enjoyable drinks.
Prepare for a few extra minutes as the place seems to be pretty crowded but it‚Äôs definitely worth it. ‚Ä¶"
15,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Quick and cheerfully friendly service, genuinely great GT's both in quality and quantity. Mussels are good too. Recommended!"
16,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Decent food, nothing above par IMO. Service felt a bit disorganized. Everyone was very nice but still felt like something they need to step up on. We had to ask 3 times for our check and still had to wait 15-20 minutes to pay our bill. Lovely atmosphere and cool premises."
17,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Unfortunately we haven't try the mussels and to be honest I wish we have because they looked amazing. Instead we tried the French toast. It was next level. Very interesting taste as the toast was sweet and the fruits were little sour. Loved it overall, the place was also very cosy."
18,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Very much enjoyed the find, beverages and service here. We tried four different kinds of mussels, all of which were delicious. Best were the ones with affligem beer.....crisp fries, loved their mayonnaise with gin. Great service and a cute place overall...."
19,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I love this restaurant, they are so wonderful hosts and they have a delicious muscles specially with truffle sauce."

21,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I've been there twice and still in love with it! The location is a bit far from downtown Amsterdam. But you can take taxi to get there in a few minutes. They've varieties of seafood plates, and freshness is on the top! By the way they've ‚Ä¶"
22,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,a year ago,"staff is friendly and outside areas is quite big, also use QR code to order the food. it‚Äôs good for corona situation. The food is yummy but Gin tonic isn‚Äôt that strong."
23,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great portion of fresh mussels with rly tasty sauce. The fish and chips is also of a high quality. Nice vibes with both indoor and outdoor options.
24,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Definitely a cool place where to chill and talk with friends. The octopus was too little (but I was warned in advance), the rest of the dishes seemed nice. The gin tonics are all of them more or less the same, just the fruit/addition in it might change the taste slightly."
25,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great seafood, we agreed we've had better in Amsterdam, but this is a close second. The seafood platter for two is good and the lobster tail was great, but I prefer it cooked through? I also think for the price there are better options. We ‚Ä¶"
26,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We came across this restaurant cycling back to the hotel before they had started serving the public and were lucky enough to be served a few Gins and later served delicious mussels, croquettes and an oyster on the house. The owner was so friendly and the outdoor terrace had an amazing vibe!"
27,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Delicious food, great location, friendly staff, decent prices."
28,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Fancy place. You can sit either inside or outside. Gin and sea food are offered. Gin is a bit overpriced, mostly pay for the fancy name. But the food is delicious and portions are big, okay to take one to share"
29,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Really delicious! Good value for money, super friendly staff."
30,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Had diner outside on a Saturday evening. Service was dreadfully slow, even though it wasn't crowded (we waited 45 minutes for some croquettes and another 45 minutes for the mussels), but pretty kind. ‚Ä¶"
31,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"For the fame of the restaurant, I was expecting more. The portions were good size and great value per money, but the service staff clearly needs training and the space was not the most comfortable."
32,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,One of my favorite spots in Amsterdam. ‚Ç¨20 gets ya a massive bucket of mussels. All the flavors are amazing and it‚Äôs gluten free safe
33,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"They mainly serve mussels with different sauces like roquefort, mustard, white wine...Fries on the side are served with their famous ‚Äúgin mayo‚Äù (a mayo with 5% gin), which is definitely my best surprise of the whole dinner. They have one vegetarian option (including an egg). Place location and setting is very cute."
34,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Excellent G&T! Very good mussels‚Ä¶ which is all we wanted from the name of the place‚Ä¶ but the stars are the GinChup and GinMayo! Staff super friendly and welcoming!
35,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a must place to go if you love mussels and gin!(sorry, there is not other twisted cool way of saying it :P)

36,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Super nice staff and amazing hostess. Fresh oysters. However the two mussel dishes we tried were a little bit meh.
37,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"After reading a blog about restaurants in Amsterdam I needed to try this place on our visit, it was beautiful, food was very good, service was great and gin mayo needs to come to London. Little away from the center but it was nice to see a different part of Amsterdam."
38,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Mango-infused gin & truffle mussels are must-try! Enjoy fries with their homemade gin mayo!!!!!! You can t/a gin mayo at ‚Ç¨2!

44,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Those mussels! My oh my, 4 tasty varieties to choose from, served with good fries, bread, and a tube of their own ""gin-mayo"". If you're hankering for some good seafood in the Westerpark area, check this place out. ‚Ä¶"
45,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great place to have mussels and Gin! The restaurant is quite cozy for spending a dinner there.
46,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice restaurant, in a beautiful and quiet place. Food and drinks are great, I personally loved Mussels with cream, mustard and gin. Nice people too. I really recommend"
47,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Price quality ratio is not appropriate. The quality of the food is ok but the price is high. In any case I love the concept and gin cocktails are good.
Gin mayo is also a great concept. Bottom line : a place to try for sure but I won't come back I think."
48,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Very nice place, warm atmosphere, easy setting but characteristic. Speciality is clear, and thats what you take. Had Truffle mussles and definitely recommend it. Good portions, and very fine selection of Gin Toincs. ‚Ä¶"
49,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great cocktails for Gin lovers (special mention for manguo and chili one which was delicious). We loved Thai mussels, nice seasonings üëåmaybe the one with Roquefort could be stronger in cheese flavor üòä nice spot in westerpark."
50,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice restaurant for Mossel and Gin cocktails. Great place, nice team, interesting price and located near a car park close to Amsterdam Central. Mossel with Roquefort are the best üëç"
51,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Placed into middle of picturesque  Westerpark. Great and fresh seafood! Really tasty! Clams and ousters are amazing!
52,Mossel & Gin, 1 star ,8 months ago,"If you love waiting for a long time, to get overpriced dishes, that‚Äôs your place!! On the bright side, drinks are nice! ‚Ä¶"
53,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really amazing place. I want to come back to Amsterdam just come here! The seafood was amazingly fresh. We had the platter which was outstanding. I even tried oysters and I liked it!
54,Mossel & Gin, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Altogether our table had the classic and the fraiche gin mossels as well fish and chips. It wasn't bad but honestly wasn't amazing either. I would describe it as an average experience, wouldn't recommend someone to not try it out but ‚Ä¶"

58,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great place, love the mayo. Mussels Roquefort of the chart. Fried fish ""Griet"" was delicious."
59,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great service! Delicious mussels!
60,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"If you love mussels and oysters, then this place will blow your mind! When you add their delicious gin-tonics to the whole mix, there's nothing else you need :)"
61,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Cute restaurant with a nice gin menu but pretty overpriced in my opinion. 60 odd euro for 2x fish and chips and 2 drinks?
62,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A great place with a casual vibe. Excellent Mussels and service. The portions are generous so sharing is good option if you don't want to spend too much.
63,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place with a lot of options of mussels and great gin en tonics cocktails...
I recommend this place special with a nice weather to sit outside in the small terrace.."
64,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I loved this place, the food was amazing! You will need to ask for extra bread for that delicious sauce with the mussels! If you are in Amsterdam and love seafood you need to try this place!"
65,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Incredibly cosy little restaurant in the heart of WesterPark. Perfect for a cocktail with friends or a work lunch in the little backyard.
66,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Excellent cocktails and food. Everything tasted special, from the butter to the condiments."
67,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,a year ago,As name implies they have tasty G&Ts (quite creative options) and different mussel dishes. They also have other bar food in case you don‚Äôt like mussels - croquettes and kibbeling were super tasty. Overall a great relaxed patio (dog friendly!) where you can spend a nice afternoon with friends.
68,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely food, delicious gin selection, great outdoor dining atmosphere on a warm Spring evening."
69,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great place to go to. Don't expect a big menu, it's all in the name!"
70,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Friendly staff and really tasty food. The mussels portions are huge so you will be able to share.

73,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great place to hang out; friendly staff; good food and great gin-coctails üòç
74,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Love the concept, the half cocktails (maybe one shot vs two?) were only 7‚Ç¨ and there were many to choose from. The mussels with the Dutch bacon might be the way to go. Lots of outdoor seating and able to order and pay from the table!"
75,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Located by the beautiful area in westerpark, Morsel & Gin was definitely a pleasure. We were able to enjoy a variety of refreshing gin tonics (different sizes available) friendly service. Their mussels were delicious and offered many ‚Ä¶"
76,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious drinks and food.
Slow service for the food (we waited 45 minutes to get our mussels and there were only two other clients in the restaurant). We arrived at the opening hour so maybe the kitchen wasnt ready yet...still delicious though :)"
77,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Food was great! We had the truffel mussels and they were delicious. However the place could use a heater, we were seated on the ground flood and it was rather cold without a jacket."
78,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Awesome place, with a great terrace to enjoy during covid. The owner takes great care of its guests, and seems to have kept all his employees during the rough time. Amazing!"
79,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Quite disapointed after the mussels, oysters and gado gado was sold out. They at least gave us a spot in the sun later on but by expending their terrace they were short on supplies. Too bad"
80,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great staff. Delicious food. Excellent atmosphere.
81,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good atmosphere and great service. It's a bit out of the crouds of people so the whole feeling is more relaxed. The gin and tonic menu     has quite a few options and the few that we tried were well made. The portions for the muscles are ‚Ä¶

84,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Edit: while last time I went to M&G the experience wasn't great, the owner called back the customers who had a reservation and a not optimal experience, and apologized for what he called 'the most unlucky night in 6 years of Mossel & Gin' ‚Ä¶"

88,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A nicely located restaurant for seafood amateurs. Gin cocktails are great. As some dishes were unavailable, the waiter offered us an extra lobster croquette so that the plate was enough for a dinner."

93,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is good but not great. We had 3 starters to start with and none of them were mind blowing. The oysters were delicious, but what possibly could go wrong with oysters unless it's 'buck a chuck'? We waited about 40 minutes for our main ‚Ä¶"
94,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good service, fresh food, fair price"
95,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Mussels & fries off the beaten path. Very crowded & lively. The meal was good but not great. Didn't get to try the oysters due to a bad batch that day. The caeser salad & taco starter were great. The drinks are fantastic! They give you a little tube of their gin mayo house sauce to take away which was a nice surprise.
96,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very hospitable staff. Lovely food and ambience. A must visit place in Amsterdam.
97,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place! Both the mussels and fish & chips are of great quality but the variety of place makes this place exceptional. On top of that you can take home their own gin mayo.
98,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had 2 different G&Ts plus Thai curry mussels. Both were outstanding. Took leftover Gin Mayo for the road. Doesn't have a reservation and they sat us even though they were fully booked. Outstanding food and service.
99,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The name of the restaurant says it all. Here you should only go if you want to have mussel & gin. Service is a bit slow and quickly irritated and more focused on dancing with each other instead of serving customers. It is a popular place so a reservation is recommended. I would advice everyone the mussels with truffle.
100,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great combo.. good gin + good mussels
101,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely delicious food, hidden quiet spot, rustic decor and simple menu exactly representing what the restaurant is all about."
102,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Exactly what you expect. Great G&T and mossels. Super friendly and engaged staff
103,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great location. Awesome spot on one of the outside tables in the sun. The snacks were very tasty, just had the ceviche and an order of fries, but both were very good! The Gin 'n' Tonics were epic, we tried 4 of them ;-) and service from Tobias was outstanding! Keep up the vibe and fantastic service. Thanks for the experience :-)"
104,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool place. Need to come back in summer. Gin & Tonic above the average. Excellent oysters, mussels & gambas. The owner is very friendly and helps creating a nice atmosphere! Well done"
105,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool space and environment, namely the music was on point!.  Staff was friendly, they were able to easily accommodate us outside and we drank Gin while waiting for out table. Just beware that most of the menu is mussels and Gin, as per the name of the place."
106,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice terrace, excellent for a sunny day. Good food, tasty, although the fish was small. They give fries with every dish to compensate. The mossels were also good. Gets very busy, so good to reserve."
107,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice mussels and big variety of Gin Tonics!
108,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Go for the entire experience, starter, main & gin.. music and good service included :)"

Perfect restaurant if you're looking for an original Mussel &fries. ‚Ä¶"
110,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good option if you like mussels , but below average fries and very limited options on starters or different seafood . Nice but very expensive gin combinations , and lack of decent wine or other drinks . You get exactly and only what the name suggests ..."
111,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, more mussels than I had in one seating in my life."
112,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to spend a summer evening. It has a nice terrace and they have multiple mussles dishes and great G&T's. If it's bustling be prepared to wait a while for your dish to show up.
113,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Highly recommended. Amazing gins and mussels. Delicious fries and mayo. We loved the ""Mosselen Thai"". Service was good and the staff friendly. It's a very nice place, I'll come back."
114,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Ticked all the boxes for us, big time. Yes it's slightly 'out of the way' for most but it's a new discovery in our neighbourhood and we couldn't be happier - and would recommend the journey out of the centre to others. Mossel & Gin have a ‚Ä¶"

121,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and nice variety of gins to choose from. The portion of some of the meals is rather small in relation to their price but if you're there for the mussels and gin, you'll leave as a happy customer."
122,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice place with really good food and good service, but I can't get over the really loud cheesy 80's disco music that was blaring for the entire time."
123,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Delicious food and really nice service!
124,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Super lekker Thai mussels. Gin and tonics are good and atmosphere is great. They also give each table a tube of their own gin mayo for fries (that you can also take home if you don't finish, or you can also buy another tube if you really like it)!"
125,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The Thai style mussels are excellent and you can eat them in a very nice outside garden. Service can sometimes be quite slow and it would be nice if they also served some beers but on a whole very good!
126,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place is AWESOME. Can't believe it took almost a year for me to finally visit ! The Gin cocktails on offer are incredible, try the peach one ! And definitely get the Roquefort Mussels, can't wait to revisit, best on a sunny day sitting in their adorable courtyard filled with apple trees :)"

131,Mossel & Gin, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Gin & Tonic is very good. Maybe it was my order but the mussels were very over cooked. The staff is very friendly and even took the main dish of the check. Starter (ceviche) was brilliant.
132,Mossel & Gin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice little hidden spot at the Westerpark-area. Very good Gin&Tonic's. The food is good, just not mind-blowingly good. At times, the wait is a little long and the prices are not the friendliest in the city, but on a summer night, it's a nice hangout. Couple of oysters and a drink, and you're set."
133,Mossel & Gin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Innovative menu and warm indoor setting.  I would visit this restaurant again.  Octopus appetizer was unlike any octopus I've ever tried before.  Very tender and seasoned well.
