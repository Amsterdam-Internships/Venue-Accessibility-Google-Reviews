0,McDonald's, 4 stars ,5 months ago,A great city McDonalds on the Kinkerstraat. They are greeting you at the door and making sure you're vaccinated or have a test. They also have a seperate entrance and entire room - for just takeaway. What's not to like about that?! …
1,McDonald's, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The finest Scottish restaurant in all of Amsterdam. Dining here is like a trip through the highlands and lowlands of Scotland. From the deep fried delicacies of Glasgow to the artisanal highland beef of the Orkney isles these dishes are …

11,McDonald's, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Some days you just need a  big Mac! McDonald's doesn't change much from one to the next which makes for a comfortably reliable experience. You may feel hungry and guilty half an hour later but it's great at the time...
12,McDonald's, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The sandwiches ar bad assembled, the bacon is raw, the services are so small and you have to pay to use it... This is not the MC Donald I know. In Italy it's totally different, in a better way.."
13,McDonald's, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I'm used to the taste and service of McDonald's from the US and México. Amsterdam's McDonald's (generally Europe), the size of food is bigger, hamburgers are bigger. Taste is good. Nice and quick service. Downsides are that I've always had …"
14,McDonald's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"As an American studying in Italy, it was very nice to find this on a trip to Amsterdam. It tastes like home.

15,McDonald's, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Bacon is uncooked. Their crispy bacon burger should be called raw soggy bacon burger. Is it so hard to cook bacon instead of leaving it raw? It tastes good if you prepare it properly, you know?"
16,McDonald's, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"You would think it’s a health code violation to charge people 50 cent to use the bathroom. Can’t even wash my hands without paying extra money. Also no complementary water, which for McDonalds seems ridiculous. Don’t have enough money already?"
17,McDonald's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,It was the same as always. Like i told them few times to tost the bread at the time you order it. Because i think the  breakfast sandwichs are not toasted there just warmed. So for that i give it a 4 star
18,McDonald's, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I went to McDonalds in Kinkertraat today in the afternoon, food was fine but it was appalling that employees work in the kitchen with food coughing and sneezing! The worst part that it seemed that supervisors were okay about it, they saw …"

20,McDonald's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If I could give less than 1 Star I would. Isn't McDonald's supposed to be improving their accuracy of drive thru orders? Doesn't seem like it. On many occasions, at this location they've forgotten items that I've ordered. Aggravating cause …"
21,McDonald's, 1 star ,9 months ago,Awful place. Super rude workforce. You need to really recruit nicer people.
22,McDonald's, 1 star ,5 years ago,This is my main spot normally. But since they hired a terrible worker there I prefer not going there. This girl is rude and doesn't do her work well.
