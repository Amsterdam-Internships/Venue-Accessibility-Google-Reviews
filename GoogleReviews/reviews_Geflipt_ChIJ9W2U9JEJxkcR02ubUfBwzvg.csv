0,Geflipt, 4 stars ,8 months ago,The fries are absolutely delicious! The burgers were good but we weren't blown away.
1,Geflipt, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Unhappy waitress. Ordered the avocado toast with fried egg. Not enough avocado, and thought the toast was stale. ‚òπÔ∏è
Frites were exceptional. Froends had burgers and were very satisfied."
2,Geflipt, 1 star ,2 months ago,"Great food, but NEVER (!) order online. They don‚Äôt deliver what you ask and pay for, the food arrives cold and when you call they say they‚Äôre busy. The worst customer experience, never ordering with them again!"
3,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Burgers in good quality. Small but nicely put together menu. The waitress spoke so many languages that guests from many places around the world will feel very at home here.
4,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 months ago,In my experience one of the best hamburger in Amsterdam! Price in the average and also beer and fries are good! They close the kitchen early in the evening.
5,Geflipt, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Burgers are good: bread, meat and sauce are delicious.

However, the service is deplorable. I had the impression to be invisible: I had ‚Ä¶"
6,Geflipt, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great fries and burgers. All dishes are also available as a veggie version. The staff is friendly, there's nice music playing in the restaurant and the terrace is cozy. If any, the noise of the aligning street would be a downside, but the food really makes up for it."
7,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The burger and the chips were very tasty, and the waiter was friendly. Only problem was they didn't have gluten free options. Luckily the pate was filling enough."
8,Geflipt, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Really nice tasty burgers. The fries were ok but a bit boring / not salted enough and we did not get any sauce. Service was friendly but slow, we waited over 30 minutes."
9,Geflipt, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Burger was tasty. Fries were average for 5‚Ç¨.Staff not so friendly. Our service staff was friendly but the guy inside not. We just asked how it works there when we want to order. He just said we should read it outside at the door. I don‚Äôt know if he wanted to be funny but it was not funny.
10,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Oh my gosh. Drool.

My husband and walked around the entire city for about an hour looking for ‚Ä¶"
11,Geflipt, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Defenatly recommend this place, really nice burger. Service is super friendly and they have so nice German/Austrian soft drinks like Fritz, Mate or Almdudler! Burger was perfectly medium and the bun was freshly made."
12,Geflipt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I really enjoyed this place.  Service was quick, and the burgers are exceptional!  Our waitress did try to deliver someone else's food to us, and the wait for a drink was a tad long, but they were very busy, so hardly a big deal.  Definite recommend."
13,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great service, amazing burgers. Ideal place to stop by after checking out the markets. No more than 15‚Ç¨ each for burger, drink and fries to share."
14,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,really good burgers.  all around 10‚Ç¨ but size and quality will fit this.  fries also have been nice.  waiting time was a but to long. nearly about half an hour

The meat was cooked perfectly and the layers built up strongly and steady; the fries hot and crunchy."
18,Geflipt, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great burger spot though preferably for take away due to limited seats in the restaurant (reservations not accepted). Anyway burgers are awesome and worth waiting.

21,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Geflipt's Vurig burger was the best burger I've had outside of North America. I highly recommend stopping by if you can find a seat. A busy place but the staff is friendly and atmosphere is cozy. Next time I'm in town I'll be coming back!
22,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Might very well be the best burger I have had the joy to eat. The ""Geflipt"" signature burger has an almost perfect composition(180g beef, bacon, cheddar, red onions, some homemade sauce and a fried egg and some salad) and a good size. Beef ‚Ä¶"
23,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Wonderful and original vegetarian burger with beetroot/black beans/cashew steak. Delicious et crispy fries with homemade mayo. Really nice and fast service. Perfect burger experience.
24,Geflipt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It's good. As I burger lover, I had very high hopes for this burger place. Very friendly and helpful waiter.

28,Geflipt, 5 stars ,a year ago,The geflipt burger was enormous and full of flavour. Prices were average for Amsterdam. The burger and a small coke for around 14‚Ç¨
29,Geflipt, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very cosy place with friendly staff! Sadly we already had dinner reservations else where. The burgers looked very tasty! So we're differently coming back to try them. ‚Ä¶
30,Geflipt, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice burgers, was delicious and staff was very friendly."
31,Geflipt, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Tried the vegetarian Las Vega which was very tasty. The accompanying fries were disappointingly small though. Our server was clearly not feeling it - never got such an apathetic treatment before. No smiles, no friendliness, she just tried ‚Ä¶"
32,Geflipt, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Very rude staff, burgers are average fries are not good at,
definitely don‚Äôt recommend unless you are starving."
33,Geflipt, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious burgers and cheese fingers, really fast delivery (just tough it could be more attention for the fries and maybe a free sauce or mayonese from the house, the details make the places special's ‚ò∫Ô∏è)
Thanks anyway üôåüèΩ"
34,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Huge burgers, pretty tasty. Awesome fries, firm and delicious. Nice and cozy place. One minus - service is not very fast. Still, if you're not in a hurry, it's a good option."

38,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best burger joints I have been to. Burger was perfectly cooked, chips were astounding. Definitely worth another visit when next in town."
39,Geflipt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good burgers, but beer selection is weak with the only real beer being Heineken, the rest are fruity beers that taste like soap."
40,Geflipt, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly staff. Service okay, food was amazing! Didn't have a burger but they looked really good"
41,Geflipt, 5 stars ,5 months ago,My fav burger place in Amsterdam :) Very good meat and fresh buns. Suprisingly cheesecake is also delicious.

burger is pretty good as well! And the fries are fat and crispy!!! Class"
44,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect place for burger and craft beer, small & cozy, but with cool local vibe. Very enthusiastic stuff, really nice after they see you are OK. Prices could be better but it is nice value anyway."
45,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is not a hidden gem but not because of the food but because it is directly down the street from CocoMama, the best hostel in Amsterdam. It is only fitting that a fantastic burger restaurant resides in the area. ‚Ä¶"
46,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,For sure the best burgers in town. Meat is from Lindenhoff butcher. The best you can get. Price is more than reasonable. Friendly staff and brouwerij het IJ beer. What more can you want. Keep op the good work!

54,Geflipt, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"The chips weren‚Äôt so fresh, but the burger was delicious. Price it‚Äôs ok."
55,Geflipt, 5 stars ,a month ago,Such a great dirty burger and the truffle cheesey fries are to die for
56,Geflipt, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Delicious french fries and burgers.  Friendly staff.  I recommend.
57,Geflipt, 4 stars ,5 days ago,"Really nice burger cooked to perfection. We asked for medium rare and they were medium rare minus. If you don't like undercook meat, say it when ordering. ‚Ä¶"
58,Geflipt, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very delicious and generous burger, to be savoured with a local beer.
Good situation next to Albert Cuypmarkt and tram station in the animated ""de pijp"" district"
59,Geflipt, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The burger itself could be better. The bread is not convinient, but nice try with egg inside. I have eaten better burgers. The athmosphere is very nice, though."
60,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best burger in town, and ive been to a lot of them. üëåEven the fries are on point, especially the truffle fries"
61,Geflipt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing chips! Some of the best we found in Amsterdam. Really relaxing, quirky place to chill for a bit."

64,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic quality of food and exceptional table service. Delicious beer , warm  atmosphere and very cool looking interior make it a perfect place for casual dining. I just wish there was more vegetarian/ vegan burger options and that beetroot burger back on the menu! :) truffle chips were the most tasty I have ever had!"

66,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Big,tasty burgers and the potato side dish was excellent!"

68,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Burgers and fries are not only kind to the eye but also very kind to the taste buds. Staff are very welcoming and friendly, all a credit to the restaurant scene in ADam. Definitely look forward to visiting next time. I had their Cheesy ‚Ä¶"
69,Geflipt, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Tasty burgers. I went for the Vurig and found it delicious. Right amount of heat and beef was cooked to perfection.
70,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We went for a Saturday brunch, it was packed already but the Vurig burger and Geflipt toasted sandwich was worth it. The spicy fries are spicy not just a namesake. ‚Ä¶"
71,Geflipt, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Ordered the Geflipt burger and french fries. They were both good, but far from great. Meat quality was average. Asked for medium rare, received medium well. All around just a decent experience, but won't come back anytime soon. Would recommend to try other burger joints."
72,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hip atmosphere and very kind staff. Cool music. Food arrived quickly and was very tasty. My boyfriend had, in his words, the best vegan burger he's ever tasted :)"
73,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best bitterballen  I've ever tried in the Netherlands!
74,Geflipt, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Well, it was good/okay. I ordered the vegetarian burger which sounded great in theory but just didn't deliver what it promised taste, wise. The cole slaw was too crunchy still and the taste of the dressing hadn't penetrated the slaw yet so ‚Ä¶"
75,Geflipt, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing burger, great place with good service. Beer selection was very good and interesting."
76,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was definitely the best burger I ate in Amsterdam so far. I tried a lot of different burger places and this one is now my go-to! We ordered the burgers and they arrived quickly (in about 20 minutes), still warm and perfectly delicious. The fries were very good too but a bit too salty."
77,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We're pleasure because it's very good here as much as posible and for relative cheap in the border of center.
78,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great burgers, extra spicy. Very friendly staff"
79,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great little atmosphere. Lighting easy on weary eyes. The Geflipt burger immense. Pricing across the board reasonable. Our party of 5 were all very impressed!
80,Geflipt, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I e-mailed the company a week prior to attending due to there being a large group of 12 for my birthday meal. The restaurant is really small! They put us all on a table that apparently would fit 12, but two of our guests had to grab an ‚Ä¶"
81,Geflipt, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The place is nice, the terrace can be protected from rain with a big parasol. The people working there are friendly, but if you like you burgers well done, this is not the place to be. The burgers are pretty big, but they serve them raw ‚Ä¶"
82,Geflipt, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Came back here after 2.5 years because I remembered their great burgers. Their flavours are still great, but their interpretation of what medium and medium-well done is not my interpretation. To me medium (or as they describe it: 'pink') is not raw. And for me that costs them their stars."
83,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice burgers, nice staff."
84,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very juicy and flavorful burgers !
85,Geflipt, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Great burger but very poor service. Our burgers arrived, fries took longer than 40 minutes, we left before them. ‚Ä¶"
86,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Yummy burgers and nice atmosphere
87,Geflipt, 1 star ,a year ago,"In all fairness: I ordered online

However, I didn‚Äôt think it was good at all ‚Ä¶"
88,Geflipt, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"It was a pretty decent burger, but it seemed to be raw in the middle and fairly cool so I never ate most of it. The staff were nice enough. I'm not sure if would go back again but overall I have no real complaints the service was quite fast."
89,Geflipt, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty burger üëç
Fries can still be improved on"
90,Geflipt, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Standard good hamburgers. They use a bit to much salt. Next to that the patty could be better. Pro is that they are quite quick. New vega burger is not that nice. Beetroot one was better.
91,Geflipt, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I am a real burger lover, this place has its touch and the burgers are very nice, i tried them all. TASTY. I am not a very fan of fries and they were nice too. Very friendly and helpful staff indeed, I do recommend this place."
92,Geflipt, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Mid priced burgers. Around EUR 10-12. Very good, juicy patty.
Fries were a bit overdone, but I guess it depends on taste. ‚Ä¶"
93,Geflipt, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice weather today and tried this place out. Good location and a reasonable good burger.  Great fries and also you can buy wine too. Most of this burger places only sell soft drinks so for those interested.
94,Geflipt, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great burger great service. Huge portions!
95,Geflipt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good burgers with unusual but awesome flavours. The staff is also pretty kind. It's not cheap (10 bugs for a burger without fries)  but that's usual for amsterdam.
96,Geflipt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Huge, absolutely magnificent burger. Fries magically stayed warm and crisp for a surprisingly long time. Not to mention tasty. The mayo? It's hot. Tastes nice though."
97,Geflipt, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great meal in a wonderful city!
100% recommended"
98,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I eat alot of burgers... From all kinds of places... No matter the day, if there's a half decent sounding burger on the menu...im picking it over the roast or the steak. ‚Ä¶"
99,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasty burgers, friendly staff. What more could you want!"
100,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"OMG OMG OMG!!! I never thought a burger could ever taste so good!!! The flavors are amazing!!! The world's BEST burgers!!! The service is great, so very friendly and happy!!! Absolutely loved it and HIGHLY RECOMMEND coming here and feel u are truly missing out if u don't!!! üçîüç∫üçî"
101,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Good burgers nice surrounding
102,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to be with a gentle service team.
We ate a really good sandwich. We didn't try but we could see with how much passion they built up a delicios looking burger."
103,Geflipt, 1 star ,10 months ago,We were asked to move to a place that was facing bio toilets with no heating after initially being seated at a nicer spot under a pretext other guests will arrive
104,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great burgers with quick and friendly service
105,Geflipt, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Very poor service. We ordered a cocktail and were served a soft drink instead. We didn't make a fuss about it and drank the soft drinks. When we ordered the bill, surprisingly, we were asked to pay for cocktails we never had! So we showed ‚Ä¶"
106,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Visited during our weekend stay in Amsterdam on recommendation of our Airbnb host. Beef burger was cooked to perfection in my opinion and the truffle fries to accommodate these were also fantastic.
107,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had the Geflipt burger and really enjoyed it! We tried some other menu items and were really pleased with all of them. Friendly and fast service. All in all a great burger joint in a nice area of Amsterdam.
108,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Came here in the afternoon and we ordered the Getflipped Burger, Getflipped grilled sandwich, fries and bitterballen. All of it was amazing. Burger was phenomenal and I would highly reccomend it. The staff was extremely personable and engaging. A bonus, the playlist they were playing was unreal."
109,Geflipt, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Super nice staff. Really great food.
The delivery driver was also really nice.
Great service guys. Thanks."
110,Geflipt, 4 stars ,5 years ago,This place must be ranking the top 5 of the best places to get a hamburger in Amsterdam. Seeting isn't to comfortable and I don't quite agree with the idea how the interior is set up. Nonetheless the burgers taste great!
111,Geflipt, 3 stars ,3 years ago,It's good when you want a quick bite near the Albert Cuyp market. But it is a little expensive and the ingredients are cheap. Dried out ham used in my sandwich. They also serve it in deep dish plates which does make cutting into eggs difficult. Also the plated were lined with paper which got soggy and tore. Not the best choice
112,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The burgers are really nice.  The staff is pleasant.  They accept all forms I'd payment. Three few times I went there I had a very short wait
113,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Starters - bitterballen were fantastic, could quite happily eat them as a main
Main - geflipt burger and geflipt fries, really tasty but be ready to get stuck in - disintegration and sauce aplenty! ‚Ä¶"
114,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful burgers. I never thought that I would be entering a 5-star burger joint. Honestly, they made this burger with pure respect to the craft of burgers. I had the original Geflipt burger and it was excellent from first bite to last."
115,Geflipt, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The taste of the hamburger itself was great. The problem was that there was either too much sauses or the burger was still too juicy, and the bun got completely wet and I couldn't lift the burger because it broke apart. It was actually difficult to eat and thats too bad. Fries were not that good."
116,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We visited the Albert Cuyp Market and just needed a quick bite to eat and a rest, we stumbled upon Geflipt - fantastic food, great atmosphere and some fantastic staff... If you are in the area you really really need to try a Geflipt burger - one of the best I have ever eaten. Thanks guys!!"
117,Geflipt, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to eat a burger and talk with friends, what more can you ask for?
But their menu was a little limited.
Anyway 4/5 would probably visit again."
118,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Big and delicious burgers. Good prices.
119,Geflipt, 3 stars ,6 years ago,It's a nice hip place right at the end of Albert Cuyp Market with outdoor seating fir sunny days. I had the Lamb Burger that came with some pickles and a feta cheese pesto. This thing was huge (a bit too big I find) and tasted pretty good ‚Ä¶
120,Geflipt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We bought here some fries. Fresh and creepy but the seasoning was not that good on the fries. Also the portion of the fries was not big enough. The place looked nice! it was a good location.
121,Geflipt, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was tasty and well priced. Staff are wonderful,  English was amazing, my Dutch not so much. Definitely worth a visit if your in the area üòä"
122,Geflipt, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Small place with a choice of burgers. Very typical, nothing special. Crowded"
123,Geflipt, 5 stars ,a year ago,"So fresh and tasty! Best frites, great burger, very economical, friendly service."
124,Geflipt, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice location alongside a shopping street. Burgers are nice, great variety and good flavors. Service is not so good... It takes forever to get served, no one comes and asks if you want a refill or if everything's oke."
125,Geflipt, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Wow! World class burgers for a really good price. The friets were also delish!
126,Geflipt, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I don't eat carbs so I wasn't too happy when my friend picked a burger place for lunch. But they made me a bunless burger and it was amazing!! I also had coleslaw which was perfect. This place is great for low-carb diet. One of the best keto food I had in Amsterdam.
127,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I ordered the Geflipt sandwich with a side of fries- it tasted so good. The fries were freshly made and the sandwich was just what I needed after a day's exploration. Staff are nice and friendly.
128,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is really nice, the burgers are awesome !!!"
129,Geflipt, 5 stars ,a year ago,Really liked the laid back service. Great quality of burgers and fries with a diverse selection of beer.
130,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Waouw!!! One of the best burger my companion & I had for a while, we love the energy of this place. I really recommend this place to start a bright evening in Amsterdam"

134,Geflipt, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice place in de pijp. The burgers are very tasty and very big too. They also have good beers like the ones from brouwerij 't ij. They are quite fast in preparing food. The approximate price for beer,, burger and potatoes it's 15‚Ç¨"
135,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I'm not a veggie but their veggie patty was full of flavour, very highly recommend. Sent friends there who loved it too! üòäüëç"
136,Geflipt, 1 star ,5 years ago,Worst restaurant experience of my life. We were not welcome by the staff and it was obvious. We were starred at the whole time almost as if to get us to leave. The locals in the place were obviously talking about us. The staff were all ‚Ä¶
137,Geflipt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Huge burgers with most of them topped with a fried egg.  Tasty meat and homemade bun.  Best burger I had while in Amsterdam.
138,Geflipt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best burgers!!
139,Geflipt, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Veggie option, fries and beer were great. Virgu beef burger was over cooked a bit and a bit too much sauce for me that overpowered everything."
140,Geflipt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cheap food, had the spicy burger, it came with a great kick. Very good atmosphere and the waitress was friendly! Also cheap prices.."
141,Geflipt, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great ambiance, good burgers. Staff is not high level, but do what they need to do. Some staff training would give the place 5 stars for sure."
142,Geflipt, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great bar to sit down and enjoy a pint!
143,Geflipt, 3 stars ,5 years ago,This place is ok. not the best burgers and definitely not the best service.  can be very slow even if they don't seem busy. We once waited 30 minutes just for our drinks to arrive.
144,Geflipt, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly staff, nice selection of drinks, but average burger, both meat and bun not too great. But I was in a hurry, so may have to give it another chance."
145,Geflipt, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Noisy so not really a place to sit with friends and have dinner. Burgers were not cooked as ordered and had a different seasoning flavor.
146,Geflipt, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious food, cozy place and lovely service!!"
147,Geflipt, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Beer, fries, good burgers, good service, and you don't leave the place stinking like you've spent the whole day next to a barbecue. I liked it very much"

I would recomend the Geflipt Burger(9.75‚Ç¨) and a Fritz Kola(3‚Ç¨)"
