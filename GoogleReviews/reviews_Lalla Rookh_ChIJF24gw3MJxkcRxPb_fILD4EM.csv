0,Lalla Rookh, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The upscale-ish, restaurant style interior may give off a different kind of vibe than your typical hole-in-the-wall-yet-super authentic/divine Surinamese eatery but don't be fooled folks: the food here is healthy, booming with flavour and â€¦"
1,Lalla Rookh, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good and authentic Surinamese food. Lot of different options for food, beer and alcohol. Rates for all items are quite reasonable and food quantity is quite large. The staff is quite friendly. Only downside is that the menu is in Dutch (but Google Translate does a fairly good job)."
2,Lalla Rookh, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"First time eater of Surinese foods, was really impressed with the complex flavours in the Roti Kipfillet, so flavourful and mouth-watering! It was a shame that I found this place on my last day because I would definitely go back there! â€¦"
3,Lalla Rookh, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This surinamese food is delicious and spicy! I had the vegetarian roti and it was fantastic, and and a big size plate. The place has two separate parts. One is for take away sandwiches and the other part is a restaurant. Totally recommended!"
4,Lalla Rookh, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great vegetarian/vegan roti. Take away is on the side of the restaurant. My favorite roti in Amsterdam. Roti is a very simple dish from Suriname, it has Indian spices and you can ask for spices on the side."
5,Lalla Rookh, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very spicy Surinamese food. Relaxed, modern interior. I ordered a saoto soup (which came with rice), bakkeljauw picante broodje (spicy salt cod baguette sandwich) and a portion of Pom. The yellow chilli sauce that I had with it was the â€¦"

10,Lalla Rookh, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Outstanding service and the flavours were incredible. If this wasnâ€™t our last night here, we would be coming back again!"
11,Lalla Rookh, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Casual but amazing. I visit this place every time I come to Amsterdam for the most delicious food from Suriname which was a former colony of the Netherlands that you can ever imagine. This place is not fancy it is not white tablecloth however it is delicious!

15,Lalla Rookh, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food was very different and tasty. A little bit expensive but was worth it.
16,Lalla Rookh, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"First time eating Suriname food it was good. They don't have an English menu or speak much English, that did not bother me but may deter others. Very well priced though and tasty I would go back. Very prompt too despite being busy."

Me and a group of friends get roti here often, and it's amazing every, single, â€¦"
18,Lalla Rookh, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My favourite place to get roti in town, really has no match. The goat and duck roti are simply amazing. The portions are good and the prices are very decent. It has a take away and a restaurant part were you can sit down."
19,Lalla Rookh, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"The food was decent but this restaurant is nothing special and lacking character. we felt the waitress was trying to get us to buy more food when we didn't want to. Additionally, they only have one red wine on their menu."
20,Lalla Rookh, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the food here, really tasty. Good value/price and good portions. Both for take away as for eating in. Very kind people as well. One of my favourite Surinam food places!"
21,Lalla Rookh, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Great roti and other snacks like fried cassava with dried spicy cod. The tofu and tempeh of the vegetarian roti are on the sweet side, and the fried plantains can be a bit oily. Other than that I love this place!
It's very clean and the staff is friendly."
22,Lalla Rookh, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Surinamese food at its best, not to mention the satÃ© sauce. Donâ€™t forget to order the satÃ© sauce!

24,Lalla Rookh, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I always order their specialty for take away which is roti kip: pancake filled with 'dal' with a side of vegetables, egg and chicken in a tasty sauce. Go here if you enjoy roti kip or as my wife calls it: rotkip (Polified)"

34,Lalla Rookh, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Asked if I could get the food in a reusable box that I brought. They didn't want that, and also couldn't tell me why not. That is really a pity, given the need to reduce waste in our societies."
