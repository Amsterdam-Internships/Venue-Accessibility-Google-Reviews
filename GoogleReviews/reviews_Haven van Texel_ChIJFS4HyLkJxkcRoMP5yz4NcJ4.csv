2,Haven van Texel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Went for lunch. Loved the split pea soup. So tasty and filling. Can‚Äôt get anything close to it in the states. Texels beer was also very good.

32,Haven van Texel, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Has seating on the water where you can people watch and enjoy the canal. Decent food that comes out quickly, but staff seems unenthused to be there which takes something away (maybe that's just European service).

49,Haven van Texel, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Apparently upstairs seating (which has good views of the canal and was the reason we walked through the door) is only open when downstairs is busy enough, so we were stuck in a back corner with no views. Who cares what the customer wants?"

51,Haven van Texel, 1 star ,3 years ago,Waiter (short guy) was unfriendly and mixed up my simple order for 1. He Was running up and down the restaurant as if he couldn't wait for his shift to be over.
52,Haven van Texel, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Like its namesake island, they don't appear to like 'outsiders' in this place. Their grasp of English, or willingness to understand the language also seems far below par for Amsterdam. Would not visit again."
