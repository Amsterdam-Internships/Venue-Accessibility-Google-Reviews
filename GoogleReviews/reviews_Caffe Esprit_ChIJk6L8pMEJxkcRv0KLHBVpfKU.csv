0,Caffe Esprit, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was pretty good but I find it a little pricey. Had a few vegetarian options! The tea we order was really good and fragrant! The draft beer was fresh and light! Really enjoyed the drinks served there. Ambience was good but the place is ‚Ä¶
1,Caffe Esprit, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We went to the caf√© for a quick and light lunch and were totally satisfied. The prices are quite high though (e.g. ~ 13‚Ç¨ for a salad). The waitress was very friendly, the food came quick and the caf√© looks pretty."
2,Caffe Esprit, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Server was personable and had a great sense of humor. Great selection of beer. I Did not stay to eat. We were on the patio so the only downside is all the smokers. It's against the law to smoke in restaurant patios where I am from so I just wasn't use to it.
3,Caffe Esprit, 1 star ,2 years ago,"0/10 Awful ! Unbelievably dirty. The smell is atrocious. Hand drier had gunk on the sides and the stagnant water underneath was GREEN. If they keep their kitchen as clean as their toilets, there's a serious health risk."
4,Caffe Esprit, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely! The food is really good, specially the pasta inferno."
5,Caffe Esprit, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It has vegan and raw and gluten free options. The vegan lasagna is excellent and the raw cheesecake is something out of heaven.
6,Caffe Esprit, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service, delicious food and central location!"
7,Caffe Esprit, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice cafe in the middle of the shopping district.  Club sandwich was good.
8,Caffe Esprit, 3 stars ,3 years ago,We ate bagel caprese ... The food and service were nice although the menu was quite limited
9,Caffe Esprit, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good to have a lunch! Open till 18.00, but actually till 23.00h because in the same place an other restaurant with different co-workers start from 18-23h"
10,Caffe Esprit, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Positive things -
-Food is good , was very impressed.
-Location great ‚Ä¶"
11,Caffe Esprit, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Inexperienced waiters ( we waited for around 30 minutes), but very kind. Food was ok, the atmosphere was quite nice. I think this caf√© is suitable for you if you are just hungry and don't have too high expectations."
12,Caffe Esprit, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice restaurant, good food (the dutchy burger is great) and fast service. The prices are normal for Amsterdam but rather high generally speaking. A thing I did not like was the extra 30 cents for ketchup when ordering a burger with fries for 12‚Ç¨... I mean..it should be included, right?"
13,Caffe Esprit, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent cafe serving good coffee, a good selection of teas and light food. Beer is also available.
The seating area is surrounded by floor to ceiling with rows letting in a huge amount of light and giving a great view of crowds passing by in Spuui Square."
14,Caffe Esprit, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Last place where you want to order food. If you see it in any food delivery app - never order anything. The quality is poor. The bag was ripped (okay, it can be because of the delivery guy) and the Dutchy Burger was smashed in a plastic ‚Ä¶"
15,Caffe Esprit, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very slow service. If you order using the app, they seem to be better, but otherwise trying to get a waiter's attention is a tough job. Food is boring.
The outdoors seating area is nice."
16,Caffe Esprit, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We went there for dinner. The good was not good at all both for quality and presentation and was very expensive! Moreover, the weiter was very annoying in offering us the most expensive beer and food respect to what we ordered (but also if we didn't accept we payed 40‚Ç¨ for two)."
17,Caffe Esprit, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Worst cafe I have been to in amsterdam. Dirty glasses, swapped a dirty glass for another. 2 hairs in burger. Ask for diet coke was given normal. Also had to keep coat on as cold in there shocking service not impressed at all"
18,Caffe Esprit, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Staff totally confused in their own system. One guy comes after 10mins takes the order, the other one brings it to you, and when you want to pay the bill you just start asking all of them as they pass near you. Everyone says ""in a minute I ‚Ä¶"
19,Caffe Esprit, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Great location, average food, bad service. What is the waiter ( the one with the bun) problem? If you do not want to work there quit! Dont take it on the customers.... what a bad experience."
20,Caffe Esprit, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"Staff that serves the terrace is slow, clumsy and bad mannered. Eating while taking orders, not picking up signals of costumers and not knowing which order belongs to which table. Over and over. ‚Ä¶"
21,Caffe Esprit, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"An interesting place full of light, in the centre of the city but quite. The food is good, with some vegetarian choise too. The bill is not cheap but not too expensive. A lovely place for a lunch."
22,Caffe Esprit, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Food is decent.  The place is small so sometimes hard to get a seat.  Service was fast enough (for Amsterdam standards which is usually very slow)
23,Caffe Esprit, 3 stars ,3 years ago,We didn't go inside the bar. It's nice sitting outside when the weather is fine. Staff is friendly but a bit on the slow side. Ok bar but we shouldn't make a detour for it...
24,Caffe Esprit, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I ate a refreshing and delicious quinoa salad, my friend ate a crepe with tasty and refreshing vegetables, we drank Latta Maciato coffee, it was delicious, the waitress suffered a bit of impatience ... but that is not a flaw in our enjoyment! So the score is ... 5!"
25,Caffe Esprit, 1 star ,3 years ago,"What a terrible cafe. The manager clearly has no knowledge of the hospitality industry. From what I have received, there is no collegiality, customer-friendliness and hygiene. How is this tent still open .."
26,Caffe Esprit, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"Had to spend a few hours in Amsterdam and found this place to be perfect: Fast Wi-Fi, pleasent service and a nice view to the street. Relaxed environment despite the little bit ""dry"" decor."
27,Caffe Esprit, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Vegetarian vegan and gluten free options
28,Caffe Esprit, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Nice and cozy restaurant in the heart of city center Amsterdam. If like a nice view and you are tired of shopping this is definitely place to visit for a good lunch or just a cup of coffee.
29,Caffe Esprit, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fabulous place as it is centrally located and offers gluten free food at reasonable prices. Service is slow compared to Germany and Budapest
30,Caffe Esprit, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Alright if you're stopping for a drink. Would not recommend the food. It's also quite overpriced owing to the location. There are better places out there.
31,Caffe Esprit, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Pricy, bad coffee. Two stars because they have Vegan options, otherwise it would be 1. Cheesecake was good, but again, too expensive for the value."
32,Caffe Esprit, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The pasta dishes here are amazing. So fresh and tasty, great spot for a quick lunch in between shopping!"
33,Caffe Esprit, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Very slow service and staffs are just ignorance. Some customers were left without any attention from the staffs. I only ordered for a medium-sized glass of beer and tooks more than 20 minutes.... Not recommended for the service.
34,Caffe Esprit, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, ok pricing.. they're not welcoming families with children though. at least this is what I felt with my two kids.."

42,Caffe Esprit, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great location, decent staff and a varied menu. Good place for lunch"
43,Caffe Esprit, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Poor and slow service. Coffee was poured everywhere when served. Took more than 10 mins just to get my beer.

55,Caffe Esprit, 1 star ,4 years ago,Attente IN-TER-MI-NA-BLE. (An embarrassing wait). They were gypsies around trying to steal our chocolatines and rape us.
