14,Aries Noodles, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice Indo noodles. Very pleasant service. 3 stars for a bit sneaky question if I wanted tofu as an addition. I said yes why not and got one piece of nice tofu.

21,Aries Noodles, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The noodle is homemade, and its tastes very good, the closest taste to indonesian noodles that one could ever get. They also have satay, fishcake, and some more indonesian dishes. But the place is a bit secluded, and its hard to get a taxy there."
