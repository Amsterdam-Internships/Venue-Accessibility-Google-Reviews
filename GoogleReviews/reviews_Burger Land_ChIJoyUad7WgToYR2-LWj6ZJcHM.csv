23,Burger Land, 3 stars ,a year ago,Pretty good food. Fast service.  Very good fries. Only bad I would say would be that it smells like subway that is next door. So kinda throws you off.
24,Burger Land, 4 stars ,8 years ago,Pretty good hamburger. Nice employees although not overly helpful. Fries were good but unique spices on them. I initially went in because of a sign outside for a $5.50 lunch special. Inside it said $6.70ish and with upgrade from small to medium fries it totaled out to about $10! Be careful with the pricing here!
