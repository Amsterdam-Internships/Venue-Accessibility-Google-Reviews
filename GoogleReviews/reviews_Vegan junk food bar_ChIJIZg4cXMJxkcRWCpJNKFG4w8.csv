0,Vegan junk food bar, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"The service was friendly for a take-out order. I would prefer for some of the menu to showcase brilliant plant-based food rather than it all pretending meat products of some kind. Basically, don't call something a shrimp, just call it what it is."
1,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I‚Äôm not vegan yet! Great, amazing tasty food. Fake meat Burgers taste as good or better than beef ü•© Loaded Swarma fries were delicious. Ate too much, but didn‚Äôt feel bloated. Brilliant! ‚Ä¶"
2,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow, this place is awesome. The food arrived honestly about 5/10 minutes after ordering. The burger that I had a tasted just like I remember a big mac to taste and I haven't been able to have one in about 20 years so it was an absolute ‚Ä¶"
3,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been eating vegan food for quite a while now, and I have to say this was one of the best junk foods I've ever had in my life. The menu is entirely vegan, and offers loads of options! ‚Ä¶"

5,Vegan junk food bar, 2 stars ,11 months ago,"- üëé The wait was 1,5 hours which was fine, but then the food arrived lukewarm and the waffle chips had been soaked in the sauce for so long the were absolutely flaccid. ‚Ä¶"
6,Vegan junk food bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Currently the Vegan Junk Food Bar has three locations in Amsterdam. I have tried all of them and I think that it is an ok place where to eat some cruelty free food (as they say). However, it is a bit overrated. ‚Ä¶"

8,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I'm not kidding when I say I have returned to Amsterdam twice JUST to come back to this place. I mean, there were other reasons, but this was a dam(n) big one! The food here is incredible. Some of the best vegan food I've ever had. You ‚Ä¶"

11,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I would highly suggest popping over there instead of ordering via home delivery. More options and your food is not Luke-warm. I really love all the tastes and the attention to all the details.
They serve cocktails too"
12,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Brilliant food at this brunch of VJFB!! Quite busy as we went later on during the day and it is probably one of the smaller branches. Service was a little slow, I think this is because they had a lot of Deliveroo (etc) orders coming in ‚Ä¶"
13,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"They have some healthy fair now over here, I had a ceasar salad with NoTuna (though to be really healthy you would have to order the dressing apart).
Standard fries and the Dutch favorite 'kapsalon' all really good snackbar food! Oh and don't get tempted to order a lot at once, it's quite filling!"
14,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It was my first time here and just loved it. The place is small so can be hard to find a bigger table for a group of 4 or 6. The interior is unique and the menu is diverse and let‚Äôs say, funny ;) Everything that we ordered was amazing, I ‚Ä¶"

17,Vegan junk food bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A very good place for vegans to have a nice meal. Non-vegans will also find tasty things on the menu. The sevice was fast and friendly. It's a hip and trendy place. The food was good. They were playing R&B music from the 90's and early 2000's. It's not possible to pay with cash. Only pin and creditcard.

24,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"if you eat here, you will realize meat should be a thing of the past. Truly a great substitute for meat-based junk food, might even be better! The service was friendly and fast. ‚Ä¶"
25,Vegan junk food bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"That‚Äôs exactly what I found inside my burger, I had my food delivered from this place exactly this brunch and this is what I found ! I had to put this aside to show you how disgusting and poor hygiene is this place !"

32,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is one of the best vegan restaurant I've visited in Amsterdam. It has got great options to select from.

34,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing vegan junkfood. Everything in the menu looked so good. Can‚Äôt believe it was all vegan. It‚Äôs a bit pricy but well worth it. The staff was super friendly and helpful and we had a great time! We were just a little disappointed in the ‚Ä¶

49,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great...and I‚Äôm not even vegetarian! The crowd here is friendly and the staff are very attentive. The menu has lots of good options and cold beer for summer evenings is always a good idea. Would go again
50,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is such a great addition to the east area of Amsterdam that we just managed to get the last unoccupied table in the narrow restaurant. The layout is still well thought out with high bar type tables and chairs that leaves just the right ‚Ä¶
51,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you see the name and think ""sounds good to me"", I can confirm that it is exactly what you're looking for. Delicious vegan food at usual Amsterdam prices, burgers, fish, chicken, chips,  beers, cocktails, smoothies, teas and coffees.  All ‚Ä¶"

53,Vegan junk food bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"At the risk of being trite, the name says it all. Very solid cut-above vegan fast food. Helpful staff. Clear menu with a basic range of food you'd expect, but done with tasty vegan ingredients. If you are trying to dodge the greasy stuff, it won't be as easy. Serves beer. Only takes plastic--no cash."
54,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best vegan food in Amsterdam. I basically go here every week. Everything on the menu is delicious. Be sure to try some of their ""zeafood"" - vegan reimaginings of fish dishes like kalamari, popcorn shrimp, and salmon & tuna sashimi. Made of ‚Ä¶"

58,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious and beautiful looking food. Even for non-vegan's (like me). Friendly people and relaxed atmosphere. Very nice alternative for the overkill of fast-food burger restaurants.
59,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The staff! 10 out of 10, always so kind and full of joy and energy, they really are the cherry on top.
Food is really nice, fresh and tasty. Good prices as well. Oh yeah and the music is also definitely a plus."

64,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great experience. Ate there twice and it's vegan heaven but also for non vegans totally perfect since the vegan meat is the real fake deal. If you don't check it out, you will miss out."

66,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for a vegan lunch or dinner, if you're feeling like having junk food. The servings are quite big and the food is delicious, but bear in mind it's not the healthiest."
67,Vegan junk food bar, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food does taste like the real deal, I‚Äôve tried the kebab and the fish.
But it‚Äôs served quite cold and ex-tremely greasy, to the point where I end up with an overly upset stomach (and I used to eat KFC!) ‚Ä¶"

69,Vegan junk food bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worse restaurant experience in Amsterdam. The food took forever to come, I requested without onion and my plate was full of fried onions! After waiting for another 20 minutes my food still had onion in it and wasn't even good! Very disappointed."
70,Vegan junk food bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really delicious - but a bit pricey - and strange having to wait 10 minutes to be seated when there‚Äôs no one else in the restaurant. Also the toilet layout is really bad with the hand dryer right above the sink. üòÖ
71,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you are vegan and hate yourself so much for skipping out on almost everything or if you‚Äôre just curious if there‚Äôs a way to eat amazing vegan food you have to go here.

77,Vegan junk food bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I had a great dish called ""Flashy"" yesterday,however,I cannot give 5 stars since the kapsalon which I tried in the past was not super satisfying (too much ""meat"" & potatoes and not enough veggies on top)."
78,Vegan junk food bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The gluten free options are tasty but not as ""indulgent"" as the rest of the menu (the kapsalon on the picture came without the shoarma, for instance). Still, awesome place!"
79,Vegan junk food bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,historic..elegant... a place to bring your older relatives for a cup of kaffie and a step back in time to a more gracious era... also the colonial past of Amsterdam and the Netherlands and her famous merchant shippers traders....putting ‚Ä¶
