0,Donnerkebab, 1 star ,2 years ago,The staff were so so so terribly rude it was so sad and unfortunate really. We were still finishing up and they actually chased us out of the restaurant because they wanted our table for new customers. They were soooooo rude. I can’t believe it. Really disgusting. Absolutely recommend staying away from this restaurant
