0,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,We had an amazing lunch and the culinary experience was top notch. Both starters the caviar as well as the oysters were on the HQ side. Zeewolf was cooked on spot to perfection. The dessert selection was the cherry on top. 11/10 and since our office is around the corner will be returning guests.
1,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I like all the dishes chef selected for the day. Soup, warm starter and main course were all perfect for the day. Portions are good enough for the taste and price. Service and people are really nice and honest. Next time, I will try deserts too."
2,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Praises have been sung for this legendary restaurant in Amsterdam. The d√©cor is magnificent but of course the food is extraordinary. Excellent service too. The price is perhaps a bit on the higher side but it's worth every penny! A must if you are in Amsterdam
3,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This restaurant is the best value I have come across for a while. The setting, right by the canal, is amazing. The staff is nice and most importantly, the food is great!! Make sure to save space for dessert because these desserts are the best I have had in a long time!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è Will definitely come back here!!"
4,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Really great food and excellent service in a beautiful restaurant set in a pretty canalside location. A great option for something a bit special, but well priced too."

13,De Belhamel, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Very cosy restaurant with a beautiful view of the canal. Me and my partner went here in early November and were having dinner. It was nice food, but nothing special to be honest, you could expect more from the prices. If they very to ‚Ä¶"

22,De Belhamel, 1 star ,4 months ago,The waitress told us that we can wait and take a table outside when it is free and there is no queue or something. We waited and got one and then her colleague came and told us that we need to go else where because other people were waiting ‚Ä¶
23,De Belhamel, 1 star ,2 months ago,When it comes to de Belhamel ‚Äì this slaughterhouse where flavour and taste come to die ‚Äì it is surprisingly difficult to begin enumerating all the negative aspects of this hellish corner on the Brouwersgracht; the list is simply endless. ‚Ä¶

30,De Belhamel, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Very rude personal, absolutely shame to handle clients this unprofessional way. Were waiting for the table and were advised its first come first served. Later we  set at the table, however some other people were waiting as well. At the end, waiter simply said for us to leave without any way to handle situation. Shame shame shame!"
31,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We just moved from the Jordaan to the grachtengordel and de Belhamel is the closest restaurant to our house, and after covid19 also their amazing bar will open again. So instead of let's have dinner here sometime we reserved a table ‚Ä¶"

37,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good food good wine. Little pricey. Great service! The waiter helped me send champagne over to a couple who had just gotten engaged. He told them something was wrong with the credit card machine to delay them while his colleague poured the champagne.
38,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect location, fantastic service and highly savory food. Decent wine list as well."
39,De Belhamel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food and view on the canal are great! Just in case you need it - there is no vegan food. The service is typical Dutch - you wait a bit long to get drink refill or you have to take your coat from hanger by yourself.
40,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Amazing food and nice canal view, great for a romantic lunch or dinner."
41,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic food and great ambiance. If you have the chance - sit outside by the river. Definitely book a table if you‚Äôre coming for dinner - it‚Äôs quite packed.

It's not the cheapest one."
50,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely little restaurant canalside where you can sit and enjoy the sounds of the city, watch the boat tours float by, and enjoy some really top notch food.  Not too far from other relevant tourist sites. I had the 'beouf belhamel' which consisted of a lovely cut of Dutch beef with asparagus and potatoes under a red wine sauce."
51,De Belhamel, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"my wife loved it but for me it was just not my taste.
The seating outside has great view on a sunny day, would recommend to reserve it ahead of time.
service was kind and friendly."
52,De Belhamel, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"We took a steak tartare and beef with cognac sauce, very good !  The only - point is that we asked for lactose and  gluten-free  aperitive but got yoghurt or cream, which was slightly disappointing. Besides this we will definitely come again."

54,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food! Great service! It's beautiful!
55,De Belhamel, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Come and eat at this place that has a wonderful view. In the summer time you can eat outdoors. Be sure to dress warmly.
56,De Belhamel, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"We had a lunch, the service was very bad. We were the only client but it took them 30 mins to come to take order. Quality of food very low and price very high.

57,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Impeccable service with a smile. Perfect dishes. A culinary experience as it should be. Highly recommended.
58,De Belhamel, 3 stars ,a year ago,"We ate here in the summer. Really great food and service, just very surprised to get a bottle of house white on the bill for ‚Ç¨48 - a third of the bill basically.

66,De Belhamel, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The best part about this place is the atmosphere. Very unique art-nuevo decor on the canals. However for the price point we would have expected a bit better service. Also the dish two of us in our party had, the white asparagus with salmon really lacked flavor. The rest of the dishes, especially the risotto, were very good though."
67,De Belhamel, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Great view, food was decent. Price is fair for the location."
68,De Belhamel, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Kind staff, good vibes, chique place, best location of the city. Just a bit bland food."

70,De Belhamel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fabulous restaurant with a grand interior. We had a great seat looking out onto the canal. Food was good. Not out of this world but good. The best bit was the location and the decor.  I am not sure I would rush back there again too soon.
71,De Belhamel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"OMG. I cannot express enough how absolutely incredible this restaurant is- definitely worthy of a Michelin Star. The food was, without a doubt, some of the best French cuisine I have ever eaten, and I‚Äôve been to France several times. The ‚Ä¶"

98,De Belhamel, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Not as good add last time i came bit it has amazing views.  May be it was because we where a big group or poor selection on our part.  My burger was swimming in juice and i hate a brioche bun especially if it's soggy. Viva la resistance ‚Ä¶
99,De Belhamel, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We were looking forward to trying this restaurant, but were disappointed. The food was as expected French inspired, but was not updated much past the 90ies. Very heavy with a lack of complexity or innovation. Beautiful restaurant with a great view though and great service staff."
