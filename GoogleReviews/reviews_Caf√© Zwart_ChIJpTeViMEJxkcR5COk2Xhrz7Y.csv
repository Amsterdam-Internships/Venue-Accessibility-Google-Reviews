0,Caf√© Zwart, 1 star ,a month ago,"Just witnessed one of the worst services so far; the waiter was racist and told me to be quiet while I was speaking on the phone! And started shouting in Dutch, finishing by saying "" THIS IS AMSTERDAM"". I have lived in Amsterdam for four …"
1,Caf√© Zwart, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a very Parisian - style cafe, where you come whether the sun is shining or it is raining and leisurely take a seat, read the Sunday paper or the new bought book with your cup of coffee. …"
2,Caf√© Zwart, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great toasted cheese sandwich and latte. Never been in toilet that small before
3,Caf√© Zwart, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Good beers ! 🍻
4,Caf√© Zwart, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We arrived with two crying kids, only to use the toilet. The owner was very polite and advised us to take the ladies restroom. We stayed for a few beers and coffee, while the children were running around and exploring this french style …"
5,Caf√© Zwart, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place with good drinks and food!
6,Caf√© Zwart, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good views, good and ice cold beer and lots of choices! Recommend Grolsch Premium Weizen"
7,Caf√© Zwart, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great people watching cafe! Very traditional Dutch atmosphere. You’ll find old school Dutch men behind the bar and real Amsterdam peeps coming to meet up for a drink.
8,Caf√© Zwart, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Extremely rude owner, immediately after paying the owner told us we could not use a laptop in their cafe and repeatedly interacted with us rudely. A friend sat down with us but did not want to order anything to the owner informed they they …"
9,Caf√© Zwart, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Basic 'brown café'. Situated in the middle of Amsterdam, which makes the terrace a great addition. I'd recommend this café on sunny days especially. They offer a nice plate of cheese and sausage which goes great with their beers."
10,Caf√© Zwart, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice Cafe, cheap beer and friendly staff. Not too crowded, which is nice as it is not the largest of places. I did not try the food here but it did look good. Really relaxing place!"
11,Caf√© Zwart, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Our favorite resting place .... perfect for a great beer and people watching. The place is very small and cozy. Very Amsterdam. They do not serve much food...so if you need to eat, go some place else first... Then come here!"
12,Caf√© Zwart, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good prices for drinks. Super nice staff. Nice atmosphere. I will definitely come back next time we visit Amsterdam.
13,Caf√© Zwart, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Good location, good coffee"
14,Caf√© Zwart, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A good quiet place with a nice outdoor seating area for people watching on the square.  Right next door to Hoppe, which also has great beer, but this place is usually a little bit less crowded."
15,Caf√© Zwart, 1 star ,3 years ago,AVOID. AVOID. Overpriced at 9 .50 EUROS a pint and 7 euros small. A tourist RIPP OFF and mgr does not like it when you tell him so. Better and reasonable priced bars 5 mins further away.  Disappointing end to a good holiday being EXPLOITED by the owner of the bar who I am told by mgr is called Menno Martens.
16,Caf√© Zwart, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Unacceptable service and unhygienic, the personal at that Café is realy unfriendly and we saw an mice. At least the drinks were good. We don't recommend that Café at all."
17,Caf√© Zwart, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Extraordinary cool guys. Proud dutch folks, but they also have fruity Belgian beers (pun intended :D) check this cool cozy bar out."
18,Caf√© Zwart, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The owner of the place sat down next to us and put our bags away from one of the chairs next to the table, all this without asking anything and in an extremely rude way... …"
19,Caf√© Zwart, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"We sat inside. I felt so out of place. The owner (i believe) was very cold and distant, probably because it's a very touristic place. The artwork was interesting though!"
20,Caf√© Zwart, 1 star ,3 years ago,I will never return here. The owner is a disgusting person and extremely rude. I heard him curse with diseases to a person who just asked to go to the bathroom. Unbelievable that this place has some good reviews though there are multiple reviews about the owner being rude.
21,Caf√© Zwart, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Same experience as all the others, I am Dutch and my international friends were harassed by the owner and staff for simply going to the bathroom while we had a table with drinks. Avoid, go to any of the other 500 bars."
22,Caf√© Zwart, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We drank a coffee and sat in the cafe for 30 minutes when the waitress came up and threw us out because we had apparently been there for too long. Very unfriendly, definitely wouldn't recommend!!"
23,Caf√© Zwart, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Haven't met more rude staff in a long time. Stopped for a drink and pestered us to leave the second it was finished, and harassed one friend who didn't order anything. Overpriced and unpleasant. There are dozens of other places to stop, do yourself a favour and try them"
24,Caf√© Zwart, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Beautiful little bar with a huge window for having a quiet beer and watching the world go by.  Really friendly and funny staff.  Great place.
25,Caf√© Zwart, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"The cafe is maybe small and simple, but the erea it is in is amazing to me. SPUI it is caled and are so relaxing even with all the people, the trum and bikes. Its a street away from the busy shopping area, and I loved it. Here you can relax and enjoy the atmosfere you'll find almost everywere in the center of Amsterdam."
26,Caf√© Zwart, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Brilliant place with good atmosphere and excellent Grolsh at reasonable price. Lovely staff, like big windows to watch passing by people. Highly recommended."

29,Caf√© Zwart, 1 star ,7 years ago,I could have imagined a worse service. Have been travelling all around the world. This place made Amsterdam ashame for itself. No wonder some people said some dutch people are rude. We find here evidence.
30,Caf√© Zwart, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Warm friendly atmosphere with lovely staff, the architecture and location of the pub itself is truly amazing"
31,Caf√© Zwart, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Bad coffee, expensive, with a bad service. The owner is really unkind, in 30 minutes he annoyed all the people. Absurd management of the toilette"
