9,Caf√© Mulder, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Seemed like a decent bar until the bar staff said it was last orders, started serving up instant death in the form of fruity booze with ice whilst they started chanting and rocking infront of open microwaves. We realised the error of our …"
10,Caf√© Mulder, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The waiter was really rude and the beer could be better. If you think that staying near to the Heineken factory, the bars are going to be fantastic, you are wrong. At least with this place."
11,Caf√© Mulder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Had the chance to try amstel bock on draft at Cafe Mulder, just across from the Heineken experience.
