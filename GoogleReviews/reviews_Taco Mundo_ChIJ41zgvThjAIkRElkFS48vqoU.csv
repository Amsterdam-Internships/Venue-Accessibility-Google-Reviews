23,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a month ago,I have been to a lot of Mexican restaurants. This one stands out more than any of them. The location is phenomenal. The inside is like eye candy and the food is to die for. So what more could you ask for? It's one of the best places to be....
24,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Really cool space! Restaurant itself was very clean, open and lovely. Wait staff was super nice and attentive. The food, however, was just okay. Both my husband and my meats were dry. There was also an overall lack of spice for a Mexican ‚Ä¶"
25,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a month ago,We went to Taco Mundo for lunch on a Monday. It wasn't to busy (off season) but it is a big open place. The service was great. If they were understaffed it didn't show. I had the Hawaiian Chicken Tacos and a  Margarita. It was very good.

28,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"The tacos were very good. The fish in the fish tacos didn‚Äôt have a lot of flavor by itself but the taco as a whole w/ the sauce and toppings in the corn taco was very good. They have a really nice outdoor area that‚Äôs next to a water outlet, nice views."

39,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"It was good and the service we received was very good. Mostly apps, tacos, and fajitas, so I wouldn't call this a true Mexican restaurant, but the food we had was flavorful."
40,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Very good place to eat with average prices and a great view the decor is also great they also offer salsa dancing lessons on certain days which is also fun will definitely be coming back
41,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Beautiful location and large outdoor patio. Decent food. Korean BBQ taco was the best thing we tried. Decent Margaritas. Dog friendly. Mahi taco was fishy tasting. Fresher fish would have made it 5 stars.
42,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What an EPIC meal!  I really savored everything--from the Baja Fish, El Lobster, Hawaiian Chicken Tacos with Black Beans & Mexican Rice to the local New South Brown Ale and White Beers--and the superb Street Corn in between!  You can taste ‚Ä¶"
43,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Plenty of good food for the price. I normally don't need a to-go box but had to here. Wonderful chips with salsa at your table while you wait on the entrees. A bar and a gift shop to also pass time. TVs for the games as well.

45,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,A really cool concept in fun atmosphere! Fusion Mexican (I had Korean beef Tacos). The corn was delicious. Excellent Margaritas.  Appropriate portions.

47,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had the special of the day which was a chicken chimichanga, rice and black beans and it was absolutely delicious.

48,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"All types of tacos, quesadillas, and fajitas. The food was good. During warmer weather you do have seating outside on the patio. ‚Ä¶"
49,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,2 months ago,"Bad for me, good for my wife. Great menu for gluten and/or dairy allergies. its severely disagreed with me 2 out of 2 visits and I won't eat there again."
50,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,7 months ago,The food was good. Only problem we had was that they didn't have any wings. The tacos were so good that we forgot about the wings and was glad that we had room to finish off our tacos. For me the street corn was the best!! Definitely do not leave there without getting the street corn!
51,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Had a couple of tacos..grilled chicken and the carnitas.. both were pretty good. Pretty decor..our server guy was friendly and attentive...but there was no ac and 1 small house fan in the whole place..it was 100 degrees outside and very warm inside the restaurant. According to the server that's just how the restaurant is.
52,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Food was good. Service was fast and friendly. Sat out back and enjoyed drinks overlooking the waterway while waiting for our table. We ordered the loaded refried bean dip for an appetizer, I had the surf & turf taco for my dinner and the other two split the trio fajitas. Plenty of food. Great location. Will definitely come back."
53,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The aroma lured us in. There was no wait which was great cause we had an 8 week old with us. The food was fabulous! Everything we ordered was delicious and fresh. The brisket quesadilla was exceptional. Great service too. We'll be back.

56,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,So glad we found this place! We got the avocado tempura tacos and roasted cauliflower tacos and they were so delicious. Drinks were great. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table on a Saturday night which is awesome. The view of the river is also beautiful from the patio. This was a great place to have dinner.
57,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Good food and drinks, tacos and quesadillas. Good apps. Very busy

59,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Great bartender.  Decent food.  Outdoor bar was great.  Nice view of the intercostal.  The quesadilla had a cinnamon flavor that I did not care for.  And they need some premium wine selections.
60,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"It's not that great.  Like a place that you'd take like 20 people and not spend much money.  They try to be creative and stuff with the tacos, but it's really just trying too hard.  Flavorless and for people who don't know any better.  Like a tourist place...."
61,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Best tacos I‚Äôve ever had, just moved out of town and I‚Äôm definitely gonna miss this place"
62,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,a year ago,I visited with my family while on vacation. We did not have to wait long to be seated which was nice. The place is uniquely decorated. I got the shrimp fajitas and was impressed by the amount of large shrimp included. In my opinion the ‚Ä¶
63,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great food, a very neat atmosphere, and wonderful service - a must-try! The complimentary chips and salsa were great, and I recommend the queso and rice bowl. Our waitress, Chelsea, was top-notch! It's a very cool open-air cantina set-up ‚Ä¶"
64,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Fantastic venue and food.  Live music Kelsey Hudgins was ridiculous.  Great libations this was a great time for my family and I.   Our waiter Georgie was also top notch.  Highly recommend the Street Corn!
65,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Have eaten here a couple times in past vacations, and it was always delicious. The food was fresh and tasty.  Really only complaint I had back then was that it‚Äôs not really that authentic. ‚Ä¶"
66,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great food.  Service was wonderful.   Chelsea was attentive and made great suggestions.   If you are looking for good Mexican food this is the place.

70,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Fantastic tacos! Wish the portions were a little bit bigger but what they lack in size they more than made up for in flavor. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
71,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Had a very delicious dinner here! Looking forward to coming back. Our waiter was BEYOND amazing. Beautiful views & wonderful tacos.
72,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Had dinner on Friday night, just before the evening rush.   The food was fine, but the Frozen Pina Colada lacked flavor... it needed cream of coconut or coconut milk, rum and pineapple juice, don't forget the pineapple with a maraschino cherry on top of the whipped cream...  Maybe next time!"
73,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,5 months ago,I understand what the concept is of the restaurant and all that. But this was not a place I would recommend. Nothing other than the service was worth paying almost 5 dollars a taco‚Ä¶Very underwhelming
74,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"First time at TacoMundo in Myrtle Beach, SC.  The staff was friendly from the time we walked in the door until we walked out.  Kudos to Nick our waiter for suggesting dishes and all were great.  We will differently be back anytime we come ‚Ä¶"
75,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Great food, very fresh tasting. Good atmosphere right on the water with great service. Highly recommended!"
76,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Service was excellent, we were seated quickly. Food wasnt quite to our liking. Salsa too garlicky. Sauce on taco too garlicky"
77,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Ive been a local here my whole life and I swear I really like this place. Really fun to sit at the bar or a table right in the waterway and have a drink and some really good food. Prices are actually reasonable considering it's in barefoot
78,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Food and service were the best we've had in a long time. Amazing food. The bar, kitchen and dining area are beautiful to look at. Great atmosphere."
79,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,a year ago,Carne Asada Tacos are insanely hot!  There is no reason for this level of spice.  Really ruined our dinner.  I have them three starts because the con queso was pretty good.  Wish we could have eaten more than one bite of our tacos.  Watch out!
80,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This is the only place that I eat Mexican food at myrtle Beach. The fajitas are the absolute best, and the service is great."
81,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Amazing food. Street corn done right!!

83,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,The food was delicious and the outdoor view is even better! I got the al pastor and carna asada tacos and they were tender and flavorful. The server always had the drinks refilled and made sure we were well taken care of. Ps- the chips and salsa are amazing as well!
84,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Colton was a great server, he‚Äôs friendly & gave us everything we asked for! The food was great too."
85,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Fun bingo night.  Great taco's. Awesome service.
86,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,9 months ago,Tacos were a bit dry. As was Rice and beans. Flavor was also lacking. Dip for chips just tasted like tomato sauce. Service was good.  This place not for me but to be fair I'm more of an enchiladas person so should have looked more closely at the menu.
87,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Dined in last evening. We were told 30/45 minutes to wait, but we were seated within 20.

97,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I was very impressed at how fast they were able to get my family and I a table to sit at. After ordering the food, it was also a very short wait time. The food/atmosphere was also great. Highly recommend anyone in the area to give Taco Mundo a try!"
98,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I was on vacation with my girlfriend and we stopped by here to get some food between shopping. The decorations are some of the most interesting and unique in a Mexican restaurant that I have seen. Day of the dead and colorful as can be. The ‚Ä¶
99,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Excellent food with a nice gourmet twist vs. what you'd typically get at other Mexican restaurants. The service was really good and everything came in a very timely manner. The location is convenient and eating outside offers a nice view of boats in the Intracoastal Waterway.
100,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Amazing. Host informed of a wait, entered us into the computer in 15 seconds. Sat in 15. Server had hands full before greeting but let us know he'd be back. Food 10/10. Had crab cake taco, Al pastor, roasted cauliflower & surf & turf. App came out in 6 min. Entrees in 8. Drinks came fast. Perfect experience."
101,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"The name should be Taco Sweato.

The food and atmosphere is good and earns the place at least 4 if not 5 stars. ‚Ä¶"
102,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Multi hour wait, service was pretty slow. Fajitas were disappointing. Carne asada was tough, tortillas were store bought. Drinks were pretty good. Overall, not bad but probably other places around that night be a better experience. At least the price was pretty good."
103,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Food was tasty, service was great. We will definitely be back.,"

114,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Food was just okay. A little salty for my taste.

The fish tacos were very fishy smelling and just a underwhelming filled ‚Ä¶I‚Äôve had better off a good truck. For the price, I‚Äôll go somewhere else. Oh and plastic forks, really???? $65 (tip included) for 3 tacos, a rice bowl and 4 beers. A little overpriced and not that spectacular."

125,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Food was really good!! We would definitely come back. As for the review saying that there isn‚Äôt kid friendly food, that‚Äôs not exactly true.

It was his first day and you would have never in a million years guessed it if he didn't mention it just from conversation. He was beyond accommodating and helpful and just a breath of fresh air to talk to in general. The food was to die for and the drinks are even better!
130,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The food and atmosphere look great but was completely underwhelmed by the flavor and taste. ‚Ä¶
131,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Server was great. Very attentive. Food and margaritas were delicious.
132,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Excellent wait staff!  Awesome chips, salsa and fajitas!  Best outdoor seating in the neighborhood!"
133,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"I had fish tacos and a skinny margarita, the fish tasted processed/frozen but overall the meal was tasty. The margarita was excellent. The wait staff was friendly, efficient, and attentive."
134,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,9 months ago,I did a pickup order for two quesadillas. One chicken one shrimp. I had to call at least three times just to have a live person pickup the phone. That was the first hint. ‚Ä¶
135,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,10 months ago,"Not good. Fake tacos with so much tomatoes, there‚Äôs barely any meat left. The guacamole was also saltless and gross. If you like eating white-washed Mexican food this is the place to go!"
136,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good tacos! Margs we're good too but these tacos are great! Very big too. Good value.
137,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome decor, good food, friendly staff!  Pleasant atmosphere."

140,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,This was a first-time experience for my husband and I as well as our friends.  TacoMundo has taken over the old T-Bonz space (which my husband still mourns).  The decor was very entertaining.  I loved the sugar skull wall paper especially! ‚Ä¶
141,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Awesome space with a modern & inspired menu, however the execution is lacking. The tortillas used for the tacos were not fresh, the salsa had an artificial sweetener taste and the sauces were overpowering. I had really high hopes but was let down."
142,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Absolutely perfect! I had the steak tacos and my husband the stake rice bowl. The hot salsa was perfect they should bottle and sell it, it was delicious!! For dessert we had the churros... oh my gosh! Just perfect meal, great atmosphere!"
143,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Waitress was amazing! Food was good! But sooo hot in there.  Need more fans or air!
144,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious food, great service and a fun atmosphere creates a dining experience that everyone should try.  Highly recommend the Hawaiian taco!

147,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Stopped by this place on a whim and were 100% impressed by everything about it! They seated us at a nice outdoor table right away, and our server Kat was beyond amazing.  She took great care of us and made sure the chips and salsa kept ‚Ä¶"
148,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,Honestly this place has some of the best tacos I have ever had! I ordered the Baja fish tacos and my boyfriend ordered the fajitas and the flavor of both was astounding! We also had the blood orange margarita and it was mouth watering good.

150,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,Food was amazing! Great portions and inexpensive compared to other Mexican restaurants. Service was great! Im very picky about salsa and was worried when I asked about getting mild salsa and was told they only had the one.  It was literally ‚Ä¶
151,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Smaller menu . No burritos. I am not saying its pricey.  I just think that the value for your dollar is there. Just like anywhere else.

155,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Mexican street corn is delicious. Love sitting in the open air bar overlooking the waterway and enjoying a few mixed drinks.
156,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Food was great! I recommend the Ground beef Con Queso and rice bowl. Service was not bad either. Great atmosphere.
157,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,a year ago,"I have traveled all over Mexico and Spain and have tasted many delicious dishes from both Spanish/Hispanic countries. So when you know what the real deal is, this place cannot compete. Food is mediocre and service and is not great, if ‚Ä¶"
158,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Food was decent, tho is over priced IMO, can tell is located in a tourist spot. The building was large and I kinda enjoyed the decorations. There were plenty of outside seating options but this was an expensive lunch to just have tacos for 3 people."

165,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,a year ago,Too many options for poor service.Tone was set by waitstaff. Didn‚Äôt get checked on after drinks dropped. Asked for drink with no ice - was given 1/2 a plastic cup of margarita. Didn‚Äôt want more alcohol - wanted more mixer. So must mean it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶
166,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Food was priced fair and tasted excellent! Service was also good. Great experience would definitely recommend checking it out.
167,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I love this place. 2nd year in a row we went. Nice atmosphere, good food. Shorter waits. Beautiful water view of boats"
168,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,The BEST mexican food I‚Äôve ever had. The nachos are loaded and the plate sizes are huge. There is always fun music playing and during the summer they host salsa dancing on Fridays. A must do if you‚Äôre in/near Myrtle Beach.
169,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,a year ago,We sat outside and it was a beautiful view on the waterway. I had the Seared Tuna and Baja Fish Tacos with the rice and beans. All was very delicious. He enjoyed a Chicken Queso bowl. The service was great!
170,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Food is always outstanding.  Love the laid back atmosphere and decor.
171,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is very hit or miss in all aspects. Some days you have a great, attentive server, freshly made food, and topped off drinks. While other visits the server does the usual ‚Äútakes drink order, takes food order‚Äù and then is never seen ‚Ä¶"
172,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Loved it.  Best fajitas I have ever had.  Great atmosphere.  Great wait staff.  Really nice boardwalk in back.  A must try if you are into mexican

175,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great food and service.  The guac and cheese dip were awesome! The rice bowl was great, tacos yummy and quesadilla good too! Loved being able to dock the boat and grab lunch.  Great margaritas frozen and on rocks. Super thankful they allow dogs as some of the neighboring places do not.  Can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
176,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Their queso is simply amazing. Lots of vegetarian options. I would definitely recommend this place.
177,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Nice restaurant but not authentic Mexican food...more like Tex-Mex.
178,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Wow, very pleasant experience, server was busy but still attentive to us, tacos I ordered were really good. We'll be coming back for sure"

181,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,a year ago,Place was great for ambiance and service!  Food was eh at best.  The salsa was decent.  Its just there really was not much flavor.  We had a quesadilla and tacos with Rice and beans.
182,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The place is big and has nice roomy seats.  Not too squished together.  The chips and salsa is very good.  The tacos were ok but not the best I have had.  The prices are definitely a bit steep.  Our server was nice but we only saw her a few times.  There was no refill on our drinks.
183,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"They were closing in 15 minutes when we got there and they were gracious enough to still seat us.  Would not have happened in New York. It was a great experience the moment we walked in.  From the host, to the waitress, to the server...they ‚Ä¶"
184,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,My family and I were vacationing in Myrtle Beach and we try to go to places that we don‚Äôt have back home either in our city or within an hour drive. Taco Mundo fit both of those and we discovered it the night we ate at the seafood ‚Ä¶

187,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Good food, reasonably priced.  Great table outside under the roof, with view of the Intracoastal Waterway.  Service was inconsistent, but satisfactory for a busy afternoon."
188,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Small portions, but very tasty tacos. Lots of interesting flavors and varieties. Busy place, but tons of seating means only about 20 min wait even when packed, at least that was my experience. A nearby restaurant had an hour and 45 min ‚Ä¶"
189,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Carlos was working the rail. He was amazing! This place is a must try!  Blood Orange Margarita, chips and salsa and the corn as an appetizer is highly recommend."

191,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,11 months ago,Pretty bad wannabe Mexican American food.
192,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Atmosphere, Intra Coastal Waterway was good.  Staff was friendly.  Tacos were a bit of a let down, but mostly because they use chewy Floyd tortillas.  The ""guts"" of the tacos had amazing flavor, but was expecting corn tortillas."
193,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Taco Mundo is the best Mexican restaurant.  And, also the best food in Barefoot Landing."
194,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Best tacos I've had in a while! The waiter was obviously covering a lot of tables,  but kept up with our needs pretty well!"

We were greeted with top notch customer service. Our waitress, Lauren, was very pleasant and very polite and had a bubbly personality! ‚Ä¶"
197,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Ate mid day lunch there today, What kind of restaurant calls themselves ""Taco Mundo"" and serves uncooked corn tortillas with their Tacos? By far, the worst taco I've ever eaten. Teach your kitchen staff  that corn tortillas have to be cooked. My wife liked her salad so two stars, or it would have been one star"
198,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,9 months ago,"The place is cool, the service was good, but the food was awful. My family and I were feeling horrible before we could even exit the restaurant. It made us all sick."

201,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,11 months ago,A must eat at when in Myrtle beach !! Great food and service. They were very busy and our server still did a great job. The mangers even roll up there sleeves and help out.
202,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"First time there.  My waitress was amazing,  she was sweet,  and got our order correct.  There was 5 of us. Jenna I think her make was March 21st at 730pm."
203,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,10 months ago,"Not great, not terrible, just satisfactory. The beef in the fajitas was tough and cut in very flat, wide strips... unusual for fajitas and awkward to roll in a flour tortilla."

205,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a month ago,Best all around!!! Friendly and great atmosphere!!! Food very good!!!

207,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was excellent. Although you cannot get hard shells for your tacos. Atmosphere is very nice, with seating outside near the water. Only four stars because our waitress wasn‚Äôt very good at all. She was slow and clueless. Great place for dinner and drinks."
208,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The atmosphere was amazing. Beautiful decor, the building is majestic. The service was great, our server was very attentive, Sandee I believe. I had tacos Americana, with rice and beans. All very good. The house made Queso dip and ‚Ä¶"

213,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service very slow, it would be fully understandable if it was on a busy day. I see 5 tables currently in use and this place is big! The manager walked around asked how all the tables ""How they were doing?"" We have two tables less that 2feet ‚Ä¶"
214,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Taco Mundo is beautifully decorated and a great place for food and drinks. Some outdoor seating and a large open air bar looking out to the water. We had great drinks and the tacos were delicious! Our bartender, Caroline, was very attentive and knowledgeable. We will definitely be back."
215,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,8 months ago,The food was pretty good but I started to feel sick just after leaving. Almost didn't make it back to our hotel and was on the toilet with the runs all that night.
216,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Stopped in for lunch. Everything we ordered was awesome and tasted great.
Gave us hot  chips and salsa when we sat down."
217,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Food was great and different. We got our order very quickly and were seated right away on a Sunday at 6pm. The blue agave margarita was delicious. I also loved a pulled pork taco. Just be aware everything has a little bit of a kick to it except the americano taco.
218,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,When I read some of the other reviews here I wonder if they ate at the same place I did. I was invited to the pre-opening seating and couldn't have been more impressed at the food and the generosity. EVERYTHING on the menu was free! The ‚Ä¶

221,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This restaurant is a great addition to Barefoot Landing. The decor and layout of the restaurant is exactly what you would want from a place on the waterway. Eat inside or out, there is no bad table and the bar allows you an amazing view of ‚Ä¶"
222,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Good Tacos and the Street Corn was awesome, but the service was super slow. It wasn't even that crowded. I finally got my beer after I finished my meal and they forgot to bring out my son's dinner. Our waiter was very nice and apologetic but that doesn't help that it took 20 more minutes to get the check. So-so experience."
223,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We were starving and this was the first place we saw when we got to barefoot landing. The food was great! It was just what we needed. We got a few tacos a la carte and some queso. ‚Ä¶
224,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,a year ago,"If you go here thinking you are going to enjoy some kind of Mexican food, you better go get some chipotle or something similar. The food here is not even Texmex, is plain, salty and gross, I have never taste anything so gross like this, even my stomach hurt after eating just one ""pastor taco"". The place is good and the drinks ok."
225,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly service, nice music, superb atmosphere."
226,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Beautiful view at the bar. Went in for happy hour and just got appetizers, but the salsa was great and so were the chorizo fries! Wish I lived closer so I could go again."
227,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Very wonderful food. Service was fast and servers were nice and friendly. The decor inside the restaurant is beautiful.
228,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place. The manager took pity on us and let us in out of the rain to come in for drinks about half an hour before they opened. The drinks went down nicely so we stayed for did after they opened the kitchen. The carnitas taco was especially good. Madelyn our server was extremely nice as well. Don't think you'll go wrong here.
229,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Erin, the manager, made reserving a space for about 20 during happy hour so easy! Sophiia & our other waitstaff were attentive, knowledgeable & very courteous
Atmosphere was lively,  food was delicious & margaritas were promptly refilled!  Could not have asked for better service"
230,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,a year ago,The food and service was average. Waitress got confused with our orders but ended up not charging for the incorrect items. If you want authentic Mexican food please do not come here.
231,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Taco Mundo has the best margaritas around! The frozen strawberry is my favorite! I also love their unique taco choices, the quesadillas, and all of the sides and appetizers I‚Äôve tried so far. The prices are a little high, but being in Barefoot that‚Äôs usually to be expected. Try to catch them during Happy Hour!"
232,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome experience.  Food was fantastic, our server, Amber was great.  Salsa Night looks like a ton of fun.  It's quite easy to see that the employees enjoy working for Chavo.  He looks like a great, hands-on manager.  We'll be back if we return to MB.
Thanks"

236,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty decent Mexican Fare.  Everything is served hot and fresh, just nothing really different then the usual fare at a mexican restaurant.   Tacos are fresh with plenty of fillings, nachos are a little skimpy for toppings but decent. ‚Ä¶"

238,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The atmosphere is fun and the large open seating area has plenty of tables. We had a party of 15 and didn‚Äôt have to wait to be seated at 5:30. The food and service were great! I expected my order to be wrong simply because there were so ‚Ä¶

240,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Views of the Intracoastal Waterway awesome. Nice friendly waiter. Avocado tacos were good, Chicken tacos were bland, and grilled shrimp salad not very tasty and had onions on it when I specifically asked not to have onions. But they took care of it so that's a plus."
241,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It's fine for a Barefoot Landing restaurant.  Prices were normal for the area. Portions are smaller than most places. My shrimp quesadilla was not very good. Shrimp had chemical taste, like it was old or frozen, not fresh. Mango daiquiri ‚Ä¶"

247,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,a year ago,Food was great! Service one the other hand... not so good. Waitress was rude and never refilled our drinks. She screamed across our table and seemed to have an attitude. Other than that it seemed like a great place to eat!!
248,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love the bartenders love the bar love the scenery! My husband and I are both bartenders and we are both local generally don't do the tourist traps however this is far from a tourist trap this is really really nice! Need to really consider ‚Ä¶
249,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,a year ago,It's a sad day when a Mexican can't get served at a Mexican Restaurant. Maybe I'm not the right shade. Waited 10 min watching servers and busers passing me and my boyfriend by and not so much as an acknowledgement. But hey props to the chip ‚Ä¶
250,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food was good and had plenty of flavor. Nice chill spot to relax. Kinda hidden towards the back of the barefoot landing and since we parked up front it was quite a hike for us. Park towards the back for easier access by Lulu restaurant.

255,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Was so looking forward to having a Mexican Restaurant in Barefoot Landing. We went to Grand Opening and were very disappointed.  Staff was nice and pleasant, but food was over priced and had little flavor.  Each taco is $4 a piece. I had ‚Ä¶"
256,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food is awful. It was cold and didn‚Äôt have any flavor. The only good food they have is their appetizers. Our waitress was really slow, took over 30 minutes to get our drinks. Do not recommend going to this restaurant when you‚Äôre at barefoot landing."

268,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Taco Mundo is a large and lively fun place to enjoy.  Lots of sugar skulls and fun decor.  Their is Mexican music playing very authentic cantina feel.  The salsa is really good.  I was disappointed in the tacos.  The Al Pastor was nothing ‚Ä¶

The salsa and chips were fresh and my margarita was very good. I had a great server as well. All in all a very pleasant first time!
271,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,a year ago,The foodbtasted good. They got my order wrong and gave me chicken fajitas instead of shrimp but it was still well seasoned and enjoyable. The chicken was a little dry but not inedible. They did refund my entr√©e.
272,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Was one of the best experiences I‚Äôve had in a very long time. Went there for apps our server CARLOS was over n above the board went out of his way to accommodate us from drinks to apps. I would recommend our server to anyone he was the best (Carlos). The food was great n the service was better. Diffently will return!!!!
273,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Ambiance and staff were nice. Tacos just OK. Carne asada taco- very little meat but good flavor with the sauce. Chicken taco-decent flavor but little meat. Fried mahi taco- awful...mahi tasted very fishy (which it shouldn't - I questioned ‚Ä¶
274,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,2 months ago,Awesome view. The tuna salad was great!
275,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,2 years ago,Came in to an intricately decorated restaurant in Roman Catholic iconography and sugar skulls and instantly fell in love only to have the worst service ever! The waitress essentially told us to look for her and wave if we needed anything! ‚Ä¶
276,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Consistently delicious and large portions. Gahhhhhhh am I full. Tacos and fajitas are loaded with meat.
277,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A cavernous structure with loud background music.  Difficult to talk/hear.  Can't imagine if the place had been full.  My food was better than I expected (rice bowl & Mexican corn); my partner, however, was underwhelmed (nachos).  Probably ‚Ä¶"
278,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Super friendly and attentive service! Great tacos and drinks and the perfect atmosphere. Love this place!
279,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing!   Chips were crispy not stale.  Salsa was great not too spicy.  Had the Roasted Cauliflower taco and Tempura Avacado taco. Both were very very good.  Place is very clean and the staff was friendly and responsive.
280,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,2 years ago,This is the first review I‚Äôve ever written. I hope the manager and chefs read this so they can improve things at Taco Mundo. First the positive. The decor is beautiful. The chips and salsa were very good as well as the side of beans and ‚Ä¶
281,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very good food on a Sunday afternoon included music at 2 pm. Service was food.  Menu is mainly different tacos with a mix and match philosophy.   Worth a shot particularly if you enjoy Mexican food!
282,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Food was very good however the service was not so good.
283,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We decided to go to the grand opening, this was a mistake but not for the reasons you might think. The first disappointment came when we were informed that not only were there no grand opening drink specials but there was no happy hour ‚Ä¶"

285,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"DELICIOUS! My parents and I came here for tacos and margaritas, and everything was delicious. However, the one thing that stood out to us was the manager, Chavo. I‚Äôve never seen a more hands-on manager who loves his job. It was very clear ‚Ä¶"
286,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a year ago,me and my family ordered take from here and everything was perfect! the food was fresh and ready when we arrived. the staff was also top notch. The manager deserves a raise.

291,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Tatum was a horrible server. Asked for straws multiple times and never got any. Didn't have silverware and had to track some down. Took 15minutes to get waters.

292,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great food great service Jessi is fantastic great atmosphere
293,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,a year ago,The scenery was beautiful with a view of the river and boats.  The hostess was short but our waitress was polite and professional.  While eating my chicken quesadilla I felt something sharp and hard in my mouth.  I pulled out a piece of sharp plastic... Pic attached.  Our drinks also had something floating in them.
294,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"The tacos were good,  and had a wide variety of choices.  The salsa was alright,  but nothing to write home about."
295,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"3 stars for the atmosphere and server.

296,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Been here twice and I can‚Äôt say enough about the great food and service. Place will be packed during tourist season I am sure. Street corn is best I‚Äôve ever had in a restaurant. House margaritas delicious. Tacos are superb.

298,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,10 months ago,It didn't taste like authentic Mexican food to me.  My rice was mushy  w/ black beans thrown in top.
299,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Ordered Americano Nachos, what a disappointment. The chips were burnt and the toppings were scarce. Where's the beef? My sister ordered roasted cauliflower that tasted like dirt and a bland shrimp taco.

304,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We enjoyed our visit, and look forward to the next one, But only if we can have Dan as our server. I know that wasn‚Äôt his title, he was a busser of the  tables, but the kindness he showed as we seemed to need a lot of extra help, was great. Dan was polite, friendly, speedy and very patient with our group. He deserves a promotion!"
305,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Fun environment, good food.  I had the shrimp rice bowl which was excellent, hit the right combination of tangy, sweet, creamy and spicy.  Portion size was just right too.  I tried to not eat all of it, and failed, and did not feel overly ‚Ä¶"

309,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Love being on the ICW. Appreciate the tastes of the food. The salsa was delicious. House Marguerita quite good. The quesadilla w/chicken...for me actually was too cheesy, not enough chicken, but tasty. Servers were happy but sweating! Poor ‚Ä¶"

312,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great location. Options were decent.. Not too authentic.. Which was good for me.. As I'm not a big fan of Mexican food. Prices were on par with the area.. Wait staff was excellent.

314,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Waited 35 min for a table, then an hour for food. The food was cold and after such a long wait my beer was warm. Not a good start for this business. Nacho Hippo across the street is much better."
315,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,a year ago,The food was really not good at all. The 2 Stars are for the Great atmosphere and decor! However the food was really really bad. I took one bite and tossed my whole meal into the trash.
316,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Can't say enough as we just had food and drink here and Carlos our bartender stayed and was our waiter also and was awesome. I would definitely recomend dining and have coctails and for sure ask for Carlos as he is great. The food was ‚Ä¶

318,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Nice setting. Eager staff. The prices are high tho.
319,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Not very typical Mexican food but it has a little bit of taste. The Margaritas didn't have any tequila, we ordered a pitcher of margarita and I literally paid 18 dollars for lemonade with ice."
320,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"My friend and I had a great expierence at your restaurant.  Being from NY And not knowing where to eat, I‚Äôm glad we stopped in.   Although I‚Äôm not use to a Bloody Mary being made with a salty seasoning, ( in NY we use horseradish) the food ‚Ä¶"
321,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Horrible. This is not Mexican food. I wouldn't put it in any category because I wouldn't want to offend, that's how bad it was. My quesadilla was made with those from a bag, grilled and ready chicken strips (rubber) and Monterrey jack ‚Ä¶"

324,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great food and service. Street corn was amazing
325,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"The food was as excellent as ever.  The only complaint, it's a minor one, give more salsa for the chips."
326,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The only thing I liked was the Margarita! The Taco Americano is mediocre DEFINITELY not worth 3.95 per taco, which btw I have NEVER paid over 1.75 per taco at other places, but the tacos here had no flavor had to add salsa and salt. My husband liked it so that's one star and the margarita gives it two."
327,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Awesome Atmosphere followed up with Fast Friendly Service!!!
328,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"Band was very noisy, waiter  was touched the straw to my drink with his bare hands, disgusting. Food was average."

330,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,a year ago,OVER RATED... I was totally unimpressed by every single thing I ordered. Way overpriced for what you get. I got 2 tacos with rice and beans and a sweet tea with my tip it was $31 just for me for lunch. That's ridiculous!!!
