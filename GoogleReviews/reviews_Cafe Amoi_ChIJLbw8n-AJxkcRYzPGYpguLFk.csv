0,Cafe Amoi, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Really enjoyed our dinner here. Beautiful lamb and chicken 50 euro for two was reasonable. Very helpful German waiter and enjoyed the crackers and rum on the house.
1,Cafe Amoi, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great place, amazing food. I really recommend this restaurant if you want to eat some proper, authentic Indonesian food. Chose one of the mocktails, they're a good combination with the food. Shared dining is the concept. Price quality level is great!"
2,Cafe Amoi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"The best satay ayam I have ever had! I also loved the fried squid and gado gado. Over all, very good food, very friendly staff and very nice atmosphere!"
3,Cafe Amoi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best Indonesian restaurant I’ve been in Amsterdam! The sea bass in banana leaf, rendang, and Dadar gulung are my favourites and they are amazing. As an Indonesian myself, i would highly recommend Cafe AMOI. It’s not like a typical Indonesian restaurant in NL."
4,Cafe Amoi, 5 stars ,5 months ago,👌👌👌this was one of the first nice restaurants we found while in Amsterdam. Indonesian food really is a special part of the Netherlands and cafe amoi does it really really well. I find in Amsterdam it’s hard to find good food with flavour …

12,Cafe Amoi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really like this restaurant! It is hard to find a good Indonesian restaurant besides the tokos. The atmosphere is very good and relaxed.

13,Cafe Amoi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great interior style, friendly service, fantasy cocktails and incredible food. The sea bass in banana leaf was delicious as was the beef and curried veg. One of the best places we are in Amsterdam."
14,Cafe Amoi, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Overall atmosphere and interior design is great. Food was decent but not the best Indonesian ive had. Could use a bit more flavouring in some of their dishes but overall I'd say worth a visit. Their floral ginger and orange lemonade was a surprise! Would recommend! Not too sweet but super refreshing. Service was great.
15,Cafe Amoi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I have eaten here twice so far and I can truly say that this place is a lovely little hidden gem in Amsterdam West. You could easily pass the entrance without knowing. The food is terrific Indonesian cuisine packed with flavours you'll …
16,Cafe Amoi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best Indonesian food I have had. Been to a few places around Amsterdam, Bonaire, Bali, and Seattle. This place is great! So many great dishes to share.

18,Cafe Amoi, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Even the mild dishes were quite spicy, which I guess can be nice if you are into this sort of thing. They serve tap water, which is great if you are not tolerant to this level of spicy. Nevertheless, really tasty. Good cocktails too!"
19,Cafe Amoi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We went there with friends on a Friday, and it was great because originally we booked spots at the bar, but when we arrived they were able to sit us at a table. The service was fast and friendly. The place is quite big and the vibe is very …"

26,Cafe Amoi, 5 stars ,a year ago,One of the best Indonesian restaurant in Amsterdam. You won't regret it. It tastes so Indonesian. It is located not too far from the city center. I recommend you to come and try Indonesian foods here. YUMMY!
27,Cafe Amoi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,When you walk in you feel like you walk into a scene from a holiday. The walls are tastefully decorated with plants and tropical attributes. The food is very tasty and done just right. We had a dish which was a spicy fish which is not for …
28,Cafe Amoi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice place! Beautiful modern interior with an Asian twist. Friendly service. The food works with a shared dining concept and pretty much everything was delicious and enough to share. Recommend making a reservation ahead of time.
29,Cafe Amoi, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food but after one hour they realized they forgot our order, since we were a group and had our drinks, at first we didn't realize it... then there were no more white rice...then the lamb came cold, then they forgot one dish that we …"

35,Cafe Amoi, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best Indonesian in town! I recommend lumpia with duck and vegetarian, yellow rice (lemon in it) and the beef with spices and lime. We tried also the veggies in coconut sauce but is not great so I don’t recommend it."

37,Cafe Amoi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friends told me about this place and I didn't quite know what to expect, but the food was great and I recommend it highly. It's best to just order a few different dishes and share them. Make a reservation even on weekdays since it can get really busy."
