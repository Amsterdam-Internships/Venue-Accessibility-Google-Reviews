0,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Questionable experience. Interior is deffinately great, instagrammable, and the service was amicable, but the food is below average, paid 70 euro, tried almost all tacos (except tuna), nothing worth coming back. Amsterdam and mexican food are still not getting there."
1,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Best thing was the chicken tinga taco. Really fresh corn tortillas. Good nachos (with melted cheese which is nonexistent in Amsterdam). Really small serving of the chips and salsa. Veg fajitas were lacking flavour. Overall really cozy atmosphere.
2,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Absolutely amazing! The nachos are amazing, loaded with cheese and deliciousness until the last bite. The cocktails are also wonderful and I loved the illustrations on the menu. We finished the night with the best churros I've EVER tasted. …"
3,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 1 star ,a year ago,I would really not recommend this restaurant. We arrived at 8:00 without a reservation and were advised that we could get a table in 10 minutes so we sat at the bar for a first drink. We ordered the starters at the bar which arrived within …
4,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice small platters to share. The nachos were not impressive (probably they had forgotten to deliver them, so they were not so warm), but the rest was quite tasty. …"
5,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very disappointing experience. The food was good, but the portions were tiny and way overpriced. The service awful. Despite it being a quiet Wednesday evening, we were ignored for 15 min before receiving a menu. Without telling us, …"
6,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 2 stars ,a year ago,"small menu with very standard Mexican food, nothing special or really authentic. Nachos had very little sauce. Flavours were basic. Had to ask for hot sauce. Had high expectations but was quite disappointed. …"
7,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Thank you for hosting our first restaurant experience after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down. We really enjoyed everything from the ambiance, to the service, to the food. Everything was done just right! Our waitress was extremely …"
8,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, with authentic mexican flavours and a gourmet twist.

However it looks like they're just figuring certain aspects of the restaurant. …"
9,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, good atmosphere, tasty food and decent margaritas. Dishes were not coming in the same time, so we ended up not eating in sync and the waiting time was above my appetite tolerance. But I’ll go again, the place just opened and they do def have potential to make it great."
10,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,New Mexican restaurant opened in the neighbourhood. Very tasty food with authentic Mexican flavours at reasonable prices - all of the tacos were delicious! We tried Frida last night ahead of the official opening at the weekend. Service was …
11,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The place looks fun. Color scheme is on point, the bar is really interesting, and there is a general feel of a Mexican cantina (though they do go a little overboard with the crucifixes). Music choice is way off. We heard everything from …"
12,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best nights ever! Great food, I love the vegetarian dishes, especially the taco! Good service, very friendly waiter. Tasty dishes and desserts, and... the best cocktails after! Even a little dance after. Great place!"
13,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 1 star ,2 years ago,Ordered two cocktails and tortilla chip. And they didn't tell us there's guacamole instead of Salsa verde so we ordered guacamole... Why you write salsa verde in menu if it won't be there?? Chips were just okay. …
14,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very average food for the price you pay.
Went with a big group and had the feeling that not even all the ordered food was served. …"
15,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We were a group of 15 so we had a closed menu. Since it was the birthday of one of us, we started ordering frozen Margheritas. At 40€/jar the margin on those must be 80%. …"
16,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Not authentic at all. Flavors are good but it is not Mexican. Poor selection of drinks including little to no mezcal and tequila options. Any so-called Mexican bar with Heineken on tap is a shame. Decorations are nice, at least..."
17,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice Mexican restaurant with a great vibe and really friendly staff who know what they are doing. We had the Mezcal Chuleton  that is definitely worth the try. The menu also offers a great choice for people who prefer plant based meals. A must try are the Cauliflower Wings!
18,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food and cocktails but inconsistent service. The servers, bartenders and managers are all nice and helpful but there is a breakdown in communication. We were never told about last call for the kitchen, we received double orders of …"
19,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I had food poising after my visit onJanuary 2nd and was sick for 24 hours. The portions are small, however the cocktails are good.
They are very stingy on the salsa verde and guacamole. Won’t be going back!"
20,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Yes! Finally another Mexican in Amsterdam :-). The space of Frida Mexican Cantina is great and the restyling touches are well done. In general we were happy with the whole experience: ambiance, drinks and food were of good quality and it's …"
21,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The smallest tacos of my entire life. Nice atmosphere, but food was highly disappointing, not authentic, bad tacos specially the alambre, but we tried others, bad guacamole, tasteless salsas. I ordered a michelada which is not in the menu and was horrible and way overpriced. I would not recommend it. Service was ok though."
22,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food, portions are quite small and normally that would be a con, but here I will count it as a pro because in that way you may try multiple things from the menu. Loved the atmosphere, it was very colorful but not overwhelming."
23,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a great addition to the hood! This place just lifts my spirit up! The staff is so welcoming and the food is sooo delicious. Favorites are the Tuna tostada and ceviche. Also loved their cocktails. Will definitely come back here to try the rest of the menu!
24,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I waited a while to try this new place and I was excited to go since I love a good Mexican meal. However food is disappointing, guacamole tastes like flowers, and the service is just like any other Dutch place. The only good thing is the music!"
25,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Long wait for quite spendy, and cold beef tacos. Shame, as I live around the corner, it could've been a regular spot. I was also here for opening night, a lot went wrong and half our order didnt come through. We chalked it up to growing pains. We were wrong."
26,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Though the food was okay, it also needs to be at least 30% cheaper for its quality. Orders where forgotten several times and we received other people’s orders instead of our own. The vibe is good and the staff friendly (but inexperienced)."
27,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 4 stars ,a year ago,Flavourful and broad meat and vegetarian options and thoughtful decorative touches throughout the restaurant. Perfect place to come as a group and order small plates to mix and match.
28,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent food, not awesome not bad. The interior is really nice and give a fun Mexican feeling. There is for sure better Mexicans in Amsterdam, but a good place to go for a fun night."
29,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Nice restaurante where the decoration is very nice and the staff is very nice and helpful. Unfortunatley the food is not that impressive , only 2 types of tacos and very average. …"
30,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"great food! very nice that plates are too share, so can have a bit of everything. they also serve classic mexican beers and cocktails."
31,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The tacos are delicious but the portions are rather small. The main dishes look more like starters. Great food otherwise.
32,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 5 stars ,a year ago,High quality mexican food for a good price. Amazing drinks and great options if you love mezcal like me. Service is very friendly here!
33,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"some of the best mexican food in amsterdam. the tacos are small in size but packed with flavor and chicken or fish. nachos are great and the food has very good flavor. must gets: elote, chicken tacos, quesadilla, and more elote."
34,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I liked to come here for drinks, but since this week a new cook and a new menu, and now I love to come here. Great taste, especially the Butterfly Dorado was a treat"
35,Frida - Mexican Cantina, 2 stars ,a year ago,The food is super yummy and so are the drinks. I've been here twice now and the service is super slow and the waitresses seem uninterested.
