0,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,a month ago,"Despite there being a 500ml bottle on display, buying a water only gets you a 250ml bottle - which costs €2.50, so you’re paying one cent per milliliter of water. For some context, at this price a 2L bottle of water would cost €20. To fill …"
1,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,Long wait to be seated. Long wait to order. Long wait for food to arrive. Jamaican curry sauce was lovely but everything else was average. Small dining area with limited seating. A lot of smoke coming from the kitchen & as we were seated at the front our eyes did sting quite a bit.
2,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,a month ago,"Food was okay, seems to be mostly frozen deep fried stuff. Sushi was good, but tasted too much of cilantro and the brown rice in it was meh.
The Vegan Lust dish is bad value compared to the Vegan platter. …"

5,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"5 stars for the creative and variety of vegan food but minus 2 stars for the poor cooking fumes extraction. Pity!  I hope they could improve the system to live up to ‘clean eating’! Of course, one can choose to sit outside the restaurant (3-4 tables) to escape the fumes."
6,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The food was a-ma-zing!!! I had the opportunity to taste 4 different main dishes and they all were delicious. I had the tacos and it was a decent portion. For a small person maybe even a bit much, but you will finish it all. …"
7,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Food was very good. We had the vegan lust and ramen noodles. We enjoyed both. No alcoholic beverages are served there. The service was kind of odd. Not exactly unfriendly, but a lit bit unprofessional. The restaurant/atmosphere/decorations …"
8,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Absolutely some of the BEST vegan food I've tasted. This place is a gem. We arrived early evening and by the time we were finished there was a queue outside. I am not surprised, the food was literally out of this world. If you are vegan or …"

11,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Delicious food that makes you think twice about vegan food. Went back two days in a row it was so good.

12,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"I was there about a year ago, it was amazing. Unfortunately it went really downhill from there. The service was awful, nearly lacking. We ordered a coconut smoothie and it came like 20 minutes later. Our food took at least an hour, my …"
13,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good vegan junk foods. Visited two times. The menu is changing. They serve signature dishes from Japan and Caribbean. I tried the Japanese pancakes and Karage Donburi. The Chicken was so real, the pancakes are savory and soft with some crispy bits. The portion is generous for the price."

23,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Unique vegan food options. It's a small place and the staff is very nice. However, note that service is slow. It took me almost 45 minutes to get my food. I tried the vegan lady plate, which was only ok. But I'd like to try some of the other options."
24,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"shared tables, a chaotic kitchen and a substantial chalkboard menu. all the food was tasty and filling if slightly oily and it was nice sitting with other people even if we had no conversation. ordered two dishes: the vegan plate and the …"
25,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best Vegan places I’ve ever eaten. Food is cooked fresh so it takes awhile to receive food and also seating is limited so you may have to wait awhile for a table. The food is amazing though and worth it!

27,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best vegan food on earth. Lovely people and staff! A must go if you want vegan in Amsterdam! I ate here twice because I can't afford to miss out on this place. Ordered a Vegan plate and a Jamaican plate, both of them immensely delicious beyond measurement.

33,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, refreshingly chill. Prices are not the lowest, but the food is very tasty. I love that this place is fully vegan and so close to the station. I had gyoza plate and sweet potato fries and everything was delicious."

Will be returning to try something else on the menu before we leave Amsterdam."

Food was great! Had the Jamaican curry and the vegan plate, both were delicioso. …"
52,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We enjoyed the food - good serving sizes. Took one star off however as they do not provide tap water. The only water available is in single use water bottles you have to buy so we just went without. Interesting decor choices too.

59,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is surprisingly good (we had the vegan platter)! The place itself is a bit dark however, especially in summer and the music was a bit too loud for lunchtime. The service was ok, but not great."
60,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing food. Totally worth a trip to Amsterdam just to go here.

We ended up trying a few things from the menu, and nothing disappointed. Spent …"

76,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"For a vegan place, it's a nice alternative to come once and know, food was tasty. I got the Jamaican plate and I totally recommend, but I think it was the best one from the ones my friends and I ordered. The service was kinda messy, we …"

80,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The food was decent but not worth the over an hour wait (and then some) for the food. It took 20min for the waitress to drop a menu who seems to be running the place with her husband. We had to share a table with some strays who got their …
81,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice, small and cozy vegan place around the center of Amsterdam! Prices average for Amsterdam standards but portions are big with original and delicious dishes! However, the service could be improved both in terms of efficiency (sometimes …"
82,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We stumbled on this place for lunch and so glad we did! We both had the jamaican plate and it was so nutritious and tasted delicious. Great family run place - would definitely recommend if you are looking for healthy vegan food with plenty of taste!

91,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The restaurant is a little bit hidden in a small street. The two persons I met inside were really nice and attentive. I got the burger with extra fries, which didn't look like a regular burger but more like an open version of it and I have …"

Just FYI, they don’t sell any alcoholic beverages"
96,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,a year ago,The food was ok and the people were friendly but nothing exceptional. One thing was really annoying but this is my opinion and my opinion only: they play non-stop reggae music. If you are fine with that you will enjoy the experience
97,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,a year ago,"The place has changed. More tables, a new look. A new menu.
But it's now 3:15 PM, we arrived at 1:37 PM.

101,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"OMG... the vegan food here is delicious and off the charts. True, the waiters are very slow and the place could use WAY more air circulation and an update, but its still worth the small hassles. We were in Amsterdam for 3 days and ate here …"
102,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty vegan food, large portions, reasonably priced. You will have to wait a little while for the food to arrive, but it's not too out of the ordinary; the owners simply don't seem to be in any hurry, and maybe you shouldn't be either."
103,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food is stunning. Absolutely exquisite and unique. I've been there several times already and every time I love it. It's very informal with humble people working there. However they have a ventilation issue in there. It's extremely greasy... you'll stink the rest of your day.
104,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Spectacular place to have a hearty fusion meal! The combination of Jamaican/Caribbean and Japanese is impecable! The type of family business I love to see thriving and bringing great food to the community. The gentleman in the dining room I can tell is working very hard, but maintains composure and professionalism."

109,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I found this little gem only because someone at a different Vegan restaurant told me about it and told me how much he loves the vegan fried chicken.. it's something he has 3 times a week. I was in Amsterdam for a day and I would rather have …
110,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great selection of vegan foods. Vegan sushi! The service is genuine and the atmosphere is laid back and cozy. Our kids were treated like real people :) Our food was greasy. Lots of oil used.
111,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I would give 5 stars for delicious food and 3 or even 2 stars for the lack of organisation. When we came we were greeted by a lovely lady who took our order. My husband and I didn't wait for food long but our daughter did. In our opinion …

113,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"We visited the place looking for vegan food. The atmosphere of the place was relaxed and looked pretty nice. The food was average, the rice was chewy and the fried rice didn't really live up to the hype but the noodles were tasty. The food …"
114,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It's an unique place. You could really love or really hate it. If you're used visiting fancy restaurants, than please — don't even enter this place. Just let us enjoy the simplicity of this place and the great vegan food. One downside: if …"
115,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A fabulous example of how vegan does not equate to bland. My husband had the Jamaican plate, while I had the karage donburi bowl. Both were flavorful and far better portioned than most vegan places we've gone to before.  The atmosphere was also very chill. We'll definitely be coming back."
116,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Sadly my experience was nothing like the ones I've read here.

122,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Really good vegan food. Would go there again!
123,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is stinking from oil and frying smells. The service is very slow.
We ordered noodles and vegie hamburger. The hamburger arrived inside a strange bread and it was not a hamburger at all but some kind of fried soy or something.
Sorry, but Not recommended at all."
124,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow, what a pleasant surprise!  Yep, the interior decorator was ""spaced on cake""..pretty ramshackle, dilapidated... but the food was insane.. I'm not a vegan, but the food was awesome..I ordered the Jamaican plate.  If you like it with spice, ask for their great homemade hot sauces.."
125,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good tasting vegan food. The gyoza was amazing.

The place could be cleaner as the linens were all stained and the service was …"
126,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was ok. Just my personal opinions about food, it is too oily and heavy. I had salad, even that was too much for me. Also when I enter the store, I can smell deep fried stuffs. Should’ve know it. Guess someone will like it"
127,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"had the “chicken” and chips...amazing and very tasty. Really friendly service, the lady helped us choose and made sure we were enjoying our food (assuming she was the owner?). Good selection of food, and great atmosphere.

130,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best vegan food in Amsterdam hands down. An unlikely yet delicious fusion of Jamaican and Japanese, with generous portion sizes as well. We had the Crispy Roti wrap, the crispy Dragon roll, and the Shingen sushi and would return in a heartbeat."
131,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I'm vegetarian and my friend isn't. Although she was skeptic, we absolutely loved the vegan chicken dishes and ended up coming back a second time. We would of went a third but we ran out of time lol also kind of a communal sitting style which honestly made it more fun."
132,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Worst service I've ever experienced. The main waiter behaved like it was his first day and had no clue what he was doing and had no teamwork with the other waitress. It took about 15 mins until we could place our order and probably another …

137,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really interesting and different vegan food - loved the Jamaican plate, roti wrap and the gyoza! Tacos were ok :) fairly quick service for Dutch standards and lovely staff. Will definitely be back. Try to sit at the proper table, their other furniture could prove weird to eat at."
138,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Yummy food. Whole place 100% vegan! Next to Amsterdam Centraal Station. Cute, playing Jamaican music and modern remixes. Most dishes come with a side of brown rice and salad which what I think is a vegan ranch dressing. Delicious chocolate …"
139,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My favorite place in Amsterdam centre. I always eat the roti wrap here, it’s delicious. Plus, awesome owners and fully vegan!"
140,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Place is awesome! Great atmosphere, vibe, and unbelievably tasty vegan noms. Very personal touch to it as well since it's a small, quaint place (very zen) with one big table for seating. Met some great people there, you might even find love if you're lucky ;)"
141,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Perhaps the best vegan food you'll taste in Amsterdam. Had the vegan plate, non dog sandwich and fake chicken and chips on 3 separate occasions. It is not to be missed by vegans. Don't be put off by the exterior either. Dude working there is the friendliest man ever, and he's a superb cook. Can't recommend enough."
142,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The food was very good, even for non-vegans, so it's a shame that the staff was very unwelcoming to the point of arrogance, causing an awkward atmosphere. The music was also overly loud. Wouldn't go again because of that, which is a shame because I think the cook is really good."
143,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I ordered the Jamaican Plate. It wasn't cheap (€16) but it was absolutely delicious; it easily the best meal I ate during my few days in Amsterdam. They also sell chilled non-alcoholic beer, which matches the food well. It's worth going out of your way to eat here."
144,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Mixed experience. The interior is not really friendly and spacious -- you can risk eating on the couch with the plate on your knees.
My partner had a burger and loved it, although it is not a classic one. I had …"
145,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had the Vegan plate and Chicken and Chips. They were both really great, large amount of food and pretty cheap compared to other places we have been in Europe. Highly recommend"
146,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is quite experimental, I found it interesting and fairly tasty.
The ambience is that of a sort of grungy hipster.
The prices of a drink are a rip off though, at about 3.50 for a small bottle of whatever."
147,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"A lot of choice, the food is really tasty !"
148,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best ""chicken"" wrap I've ever had. The ""chicken"" had the most amazing consistency. I really liked the atmosphere and because of the set-up you end up talking to the people around you. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu!"
149,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Unfortunately the worst vegan restaurant I've ever been to. The waitress didn't seem to care at all.
We ordered two cakes....and had to wait an entire hour! For two cakes!!! …"
150,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A mindblowing fusion of Japanese and Carribean cuisine
151,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,a year ago,One of the best foods I've had in my life. Delicious! There was a friendly and laid back atmosphere and me and my friends are definitely coming back.
152,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was extremely flavourful. We had the vegan platter and the chicken roti wrap which were amazing.  The atmosphere could be a bit more cleaner, but food was excellent!"
153,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food can take time. This is not a reflection on the staff making you feel welcome or caring for their customers. This place has truly great food. I left happy, full, and totally satisfied with my dining experience."
154,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely incredible restaurant, fusing Japanese and Jamaican cuisine, a match i never would have thought of. You get the impression that it's a family run restaurant and their food comes straight from their own family dinners, it's awesome."
155,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,3 years ago,Awful... We were a group of six people and had to wait over 30min after we could order our drinks. Half of the drinks we wanted weren't available. Then the food came and tasted good (therefore you got one star) but half of our order was …

160,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Simple yet amazing food. For me as a vegan that visited many places in Amsterdam, this is a rockstar place to go! Love it! The atmosphere is really cozy and laid back."
161,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is absolutely amazing! You could be little bit disappointed by design of the place, but when you got your vegan/jamaica plate or something else that they made - you’ll forget about everything. Best vegan meal I ever eate. …"
162,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"It's been over two years since I last ate here, the vibe and great food taste have stuck with me since. …"
163,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing vegan food! If you used to love chicken or if you are not vegan, but want to try out plantbased alternatives to animal products, you must try their chicken! The cheese sticks, Caribbean plate and nondog are amazing as well."
164,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Vegan chicken tastes like real one!
165,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food!! The best vegan dishes we’ve tried so far in Dam.

167,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"The best kept vegan secret in Amsterdam, coupled with family-friendly service! Perfect for family dining or casual mid-day meal. If you have the time, they also offer rich artistic experiences and holistic health sessions. My favorite is …"
168,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"best food in Amsterdam. The staff are wonderful and the food is even better, go here even if you are not veggie or vegan. It is simply the best. I will 110% come back when I re-visit. so good. …"
169,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Food is definitely worth the visit. The small Cafe (Restaurant?) has a very cozy and personal atmosphere. The diverse menue offers good options from smaller burgers to whole-hearted and savory dishes, that are delicious and original. Don't expect a traditional interior."
170,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"WOW WOW WOW
The food is SO Tasty. My husband had eaten there before and we with friends and everyone enjoyed their meal.  The flavors were fantastic, we will be back soon."
171,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,2 years ago,Digusting food with bad texture and too much salt. The first vegan restaurant (out of maybe 50 I visited in whole europe) that I didn't like. Also the appearance of the furniture and the walls didn't look very inviting :(
172,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Really good vegan food! Nice sweets. They could have some more drinks.
The toilet is not that nice."
173,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Hands down the worst service I have ever received in my life. I went to dine there at around 3pm after an extremely rough morning, ordered water and an appetizer. Waiter forgot my water and brought appetizer. He finally came back and I …"

175,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I came to TerraZen every single day I was in Amsterdam. The food is delicious and I loved meeting people at the giant dinner table while we ate our incredible food. The ginger coffee is the only thing that will get me going ever again. And …
176,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Very unclean place, the service was horrible and not welcoming. The waitress made faces when we asked for water, and slammed the cup on the table when she brought it. We ordered two different dishes that tasted the same. Breadcrumb covered Tofu with BBQ sauce on top!!!
Not recommended!"
177,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,3 years ago,No ventilation means that the air inside was stale. I'm not exaggerating. Try cooking for a day in a closed kitchen and after some time the nice food smells are no longer nice. …
178,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food, quick service, nice music and finally a restaurant with a good price/quantity ratio. They changed their interior which is great! This will make us finally come more frequently. Lovely place!"
179,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Mixed feelings, staff was a bit chaotic and untrained, forgetting orders and cutlery. It is not very clean and spacious, music was annoying RnB and loud. Food was partly very good but there were also some little faux pas like stale bread on the burger that I am sure got microwaved. The food is also pricey."
180,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing the chicken bites are great
181,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Incredibly good vegan food. Please get the Caribbean roti with hummus veg and vegan chicken- best meal of my life by far! Friendly staff and lovely space/atmosphere
182,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Vegan restaurant serving mostly Japanese food with a laid back atmosphere.
183,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food at decent prices. Really lovely place to eat. Came once in 2012 and brought friends back in 2019. Glad to see this place is still open. Long may it continue.
184,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I absolutely love the food here...I’ve been here twice so far...the first time I had the “chicken” sandwich and asked that “bacon” and “cheese” be added...heavenly! I had a hard time finishing it since it was so filling :)
The 2nd time I had a seaweed salad and that had a nice salty taste to it"
185,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,They serve a mix of Japanese and Jamaican food and everything is so tasty with a twist. I really recommend it if you're tired of the regular vegan burgers everyone seems to sell.
186,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Some of the best food i've ever had! The crispy rito wrap is a god-send and AMAZING.
I know its not technically vegan but some kind of bug repellant would help with the mosquitos hovering about. Literally the only fault - LOVED IT"
187,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The fish sandwich changed my life. Couldn't tell it was not fish. I'm vegan and was scared it was real fish, that's how close it felt to real fish.  The cheese sticks have an excellent sushi/asian spin to them. The Roti??? Oh the Roti is a …"
188,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Soul food at it's best! the food here is amazing and it's flavors very unique. Cannot recommend it enough, one of my favorites in Amsterdam."
189,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really tasty vegan food. Had the vegan plate. Great combo of flavours and very satisfying.
Vegan ‘chicken’ is also really tasty and a lot like actual chicken nuggets"
190,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food and lovely people. They are also very honest: a precious set of pens felt from my bag and they ran after me in the street to give it back 😲😊 I recommend on all levels! Thank you so much!!!
191,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent vegan food in the city centre. A little hidden, but worth the find. Slightly on the expensive side but super tasty. I had the Jamaican plate & it was delicious."
192,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Deliciooouus asian vegan food. Good prices.
193,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The most amazing vegan food in town. Service can be slow as it’s a small kitchen with only one or two people cooking but it’s absolutely worth the wait.
The roti wrap is a game changer."
194,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Incredible, I had the Jamaican plate and it was generous and delicious. The cashew smoothie is a total winner too! The staff are really kind and welcoming, definitely recommend."
195,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Seriously the best vegan place i've ever tried..food took awhile to arrive when there weren't so many people, but totally worthed the wait. Tred cheese stick, fried rice and sushi roll, all 5/5..amazing..I dont know how these guys doing but the fusion is plain success"
196,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very nice inexpensive Japanese homemade food .
197,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Had the burger and the fried noodles. Extremely greasy, fried food, expected much better after seeing all the good reviews. Doesn't stand out in the least from all otger junk food in Adam and was expensive in comparison. Would not recommend."
198,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"If I had to rate just the food it would be a 5, but the service is a little slow, though friendly. On my first visit I tried the avocado natto and miso soup. I do not recommend natto unless you've had it before, as it is slimy and a little …"
199,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Not vegan, but I am vegetarian. The food here is amazing. Something for everyone ... even non-vegans. On had the vegan burger, with extra vegan bacon (delicious) and fries. Definitely will be returning."
200,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Was my favourite place to buy food in Amsterdam. Cosy place inside and friendly staff, but more importantly the food was exceptional. Absolutely loved the tempeh burger and the curry! Highly recommended."
201,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was ok. +1 for a vegan spot.  Issue is that the service was ok and food didn't seem very healthy.  I may go again in future but not what I was expecting..
202,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 years ago,TerraZen is a tiny cafe/restaurant specialising in vegan Japanese and Caribbean food. It's located down a side-street; not sure if that's why it didn't seem busy or we just happened to arrive at a quiet time. Service wasn't super-quick but …
203,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I think it's absolutely awesome what these lovely people did.
Food is heavenly and music fits perfectly.
Don't judge the place by its looks, it's small but cosy and the food deserves more than 5 stars"
204,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is really very tasty, but it's just all too slow. One guy in the kitchen, struggles to deliver. But if you have time, go and enjoy the food."
205,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Shockingly bad service. I ate here several times before and  always found it worth the time waiting (a long time), and the price (expensive).
This time though, our experience was very bad. …"
206,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food! Loved the Jamaican plate and Dragon roll. Very delicious. Full of flavors. Friendly staff.
207,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,6 years ago,"One of the worst experiences in Amsterdam. Extremely rude owner/staff, might scold his assistant or you at almost random times. I am still mad and my mood is down 2 hours after leaving this place, though I was having a great day before I have  been to this place. food? Average taste, very expensive."
208,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"amazing food, super friendly owner, just take into account that the place is not big. My card didn't work when I  wanted to pay, and I didn't have smaller cash, so the owner gave me more cash in return saying I can pay more next time. Isn't that amazing? I will definitely come back soon!"
209,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is the place to eat Amazing plant base food. Stop looking to go elsewhere. This is the spot. Jamaican plate, Roti wrap, vegan chicken. This is sensational."
210,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is outstanding! Cool vibes, excellent food. Any vegans visiting Amsterdam should make it a point to visit. You won't regret it. So good!"
211,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely love this place! Very homey and cozy. It feels like you are hanging out in their home while they cook for you. Everything on the menu is delicious!!
212,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Disgusting, disgusting customer service. Waiters and chef were appalling when we tried to swap a tasteless roti. No apologies for the awful food and no manners. Will never go back to this utter dump."
213,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,3 years ago,We only tried one thing being the African Bowl which was very pleasant but it was far too expensive for the portion size and you certainly weren't paying for the ambiance/decor. If it was cheaper then I'd have given another star.
214,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is very nice when the Japanese lady is cooking, otherwise it varies a lot. Service isn't very good and the place is filthy, when you leave you will smell like old oil and your clothes need to be washed."
215,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Amazing little place. The vegan fried chicken with chips and vegan bacon was very good. The staff was very friendly. Really enjoyed and hope to come back.
216,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great home made food. Affordable prices for city centre.
217,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was great, but expensive. I had to wait 40 minutes for my meal cause they forgot about it. The place was full so I proposed one couple to share a table with me and waiter didn’t let us do it. It’s weird, especially that they pretend to have this hippie/hipster vibe 🙄"
218,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,They offered food in exchange for currency. The food pleased me. I had the tofu chicken and fries. The bean-bird was quite pleasing to my pallet. I also tried a soup. This was also pleasing. The free wifi was both free and wifi.
219,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good original food, reasonable price considering the big portions and the location in the middle of Amsterdam. Relaxing music. Trendy environment.  Friendly staff"
220,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This vegan food was amazing! The prices were very reasonable because the portions are more than enough. Every single item on the menu is vegan with lots of variety. I really enjoyed the Crispy Roti Wrap and Terra fries. The atmosphere was also very chill and cosy. If I could give it 10 stars I would.
221,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best vegan food in Amsterdam, kindest staff and there is a toilet too, not like other reviewers stated. Hidden gem!"
222,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff and cozy place!
Food was a bit heavy, a bit too ""everything battered and deep fried"" for my taste. But maybe I just ordered the wrong thing."
223,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice small vegan bistro, not really good service... But the food! 😍 omg! So so good food. It really worth the wait to it!"
224,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"DELICIOUS. This homemade food is so delicious and so genuine and flavourful. The 'chicken' and sushi is to die for. Such a cute and welcoming atmosphere, I love the quirky vibe."

The evolution of this place has to date been remarkable. …"
226,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A worm vegan place with nice people and excellent flavours!!!
227,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was good, but the place was not well kept.They were also pretty bad at coordinating - we received the food at completely different times, so one person was done eating quite some time before the other even started. Not just us - we saw all tables had the same problem."
228,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Last night I went to eat under reccomendation of some friends.
I stepped in and there were only 2 places left next to the window but I didnt know if they were reserved or available. I went behind the line of the kitchen …"

231,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is delicious, service not so much. Great food takes awhile to make but after my husband and I received our food, it took two requests and ten minutes to get silverware and there was only one other person present."
232,TerraZen Centre, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Not so great and very expensive. The service is slow and confusing. The food is okay but very expensive. A bottle of water is €3, which is unbelievable. The music is loud and irritating, and they keep skipping from song to song without letting over finish. Just terrible."
233,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"The only truly vegan place in Holland. Really friendly staff, really yummy food. The place is modest in decoration but always full of positive vibe and always something arty happening. Recommended."
234,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"We enjoyed it here and I certainly refined it as an all vegan place. However, it's very small, service is very nice but slow and unprofessional, and the opening hours published at their website are incorrect (mislead us, as we came here to fund the place closed at 9pm, when the website said 10pm). It's also not on the cheaper side"
235,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"If you can look over the fact that it's not the cleanest place you will be amazed by the taste of food here. I swear the soya ""chicken"" is better than the real one! It's a family estabilishment run by really kind people, I'm back today for the 3rd consecutive day, that tells everything."
236,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I really liked it! The food was really nice. Tbh i was a bit confused when i walked in because the room is so tiny and it didn't really feel like a restaurant but in the end it felt really welcome! So i'm happy that i went there 👌
237,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was superb, since this is a family run store, there was a bit of a wait. I recommend eating here as a pure vegan."
238,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Had it been cheaper,  I would have been okay with it.  Food was not worth the high price.  Was not fresh, was just a bunch of fried carbs. Vegan restaurants like these that charge exorbitant prices for mediocre food are why people find it hard to go vegan."
239,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A lot of food options and desserts like coconut milkshakes and pies.
Nice music and cosy atmosphere. Definentely a must go for a vegan or anyone who likes vegan food :)"
240,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Both meals (Noodels & Burger) were oversalted and nauseating. Soya sauce was everywere. No cart with information about the meals, just some namens of the meals on a wall. Unfriendly Personal."
241,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent vegan food: Jamaican innovation with Japanese perfection.
The space is tiny, decoration innovative. Kind of home cooking for the public."
242,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best food I have ever had. It's cosy and relaxed and sometimes there is a bit of a wait but it's worth it. I'd plan another trip to amsterdam just to eat at this restaurant
243,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely delicious, bursting with flavour! As a vegan i would sometimes hesitate bringing non-vegan friends to a vegan restaurant, I'm confident anyone would love this."

251,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Do your self a favor, go visit this place if your in Amsterdam. Vegan or not, the food is divine. The springrolls are highly recommended. Diffently a place we will be coming back to in the future."
252,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,a year ago,Good food 4 good people. They still served us close before they close. Could enter with the dog. good vibe here.
253,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Waited 40min to learn there was no gluten free chicken bites today, when I asked for gluten free option right when I entered. I left in exasperation. Staff should be nicer also."

255,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Average food,  place needs decor revamp. Blasting music to the point your ears hurt. Also I wouldn't say great value. Generous 3."
256,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful food. The wakame salad blew me away and I'm a meat eater!! I can't recommend it enough!
257,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I've always been reserved about foods especially foods that I had never eaten but as a person who cooks & knows about taste ,I can safely say that TERRAZEN CENTRE is one of the top places I've ever eaten period, I'm a meat & seafood person …"

259,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,a year ago,Absolutely amazing food
260,TerraZen Centre, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Had to wait 30 mins for them to even take our order when the place wasnt even that busy. Actually couldn't finish the food because I got a bad stomachache... but my boyfriend was pleased with his food

262,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very nice Jamaican plate and dragon roll 🙂

268,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Small caffe that looks like someone restaurated Aparment .... Small kitchen with good health food and nice options of smuties ... food very tasty and lots of options plus all stuff speak English fluently. I really enjoyed visiting this place and will come back again for sure.
269,TerraZen Centre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super delicious vegan restaurant. Not a vegetarian but I can live with dishes in this restaurant. Highly recommended!
270,TerraZen Centre, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We sat in the restaurant for 10 minutes without any service, only to be told that the restaurant is closing early and we would have to leave. No signs or any kind of notice that the restaurant would be closing early that day"
271,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty food and I highly recommend for vegans and vegetarians, but you will leave the place smelling of food. They need better exhaust fans."

Tasty and refreshing. My compliments to the chef and staff...😁"

789,TerraZen Centre, 4 stars ,5 days ago,Man fühlt sich zu 100% als wäre man in Thailand. Sehr cooles Ambiente typisch Thailändisch. Das Essen war sehr lecker und das Personal freundlich. Leider war die Toilette richtig unsauber... Was aber das Thailandfeeling verstärkt hat 😂 …
