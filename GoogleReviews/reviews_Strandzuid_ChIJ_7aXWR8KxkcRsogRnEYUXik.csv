0,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Great casual scene for good food and drinks. We got the flatness with hummus, chicken wings (they were awesome), chorizo roll, fries. Overall good food but service was rather slow / understaffed."
1,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,8 months ago,A very happening place! Terrace by the water with boats sailing....Food and drinks were fantastic! Very friendly staff. They also have a big screen for sports. The atmosphere was lively
2,Strandzuid, 1 star ,7 months ago,Nice view but terrible service! We had to wait 40 minutes to get 2 beers‚Ä¶ if you are lucky you can get the attention from one of the waiters. We asked 3 times about our drinks and when we finally got them they said that ‚Äúthey couldn‚Äôt find the table‚Äù. It was already paid (through an app) otherwise we would have left after 15 minutes.
3,Strandzuid, 1 star ,7 months ago,"The staff let's pigeons eat from used plates. I mentioned that the pigeons are walking over the cutlery, but the staff kept on serving the cutlery to customers. They even take cutlery while the pigeons are sitting on it!"
4,Strandzuid, 3 stars ,10 months ago,"The restaurant is located in a very nice spot in Amsterdam! It gives off beach vibes. However, sadly it is not really adapted to internationals, as they don‚Äôt have English menus and the servers take some time to get accustomed to their ‚Ä¶"
5,Strandzuid, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Wouldn't recommend having an event here because security is very rude and aggressive to guests at the end which leaves a  bad taste in your mouth.  Food OK, nothing special except the chicken skewer which was great. Service below average ‚Ä¶"
6,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,a year ago,I had an amazing experience at Strandzuid. Just had a quick coffee and juice but the place and mood are great. I will definitely come back to taste the food which by the way looked amazing. I peeped on the other tables.
7,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Super nice spot to hang out for lunch on a sunny day. They have a man-made beach with hammocks and lounge chairs. They have a dock right on the water. And there are plenty of trees if you want shade. The classic burger was pretty good, and the fries came with truffle mayo. It's a bit expensive, but it was worth it."
8,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great healthy menu and nice location!!
9,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Amazing water view and they are really good at accommodating big parties, so great spot for birthday drinks! The staff is always incredible nice considering how busy it gets and the different flavor lemonades are super nice."
10,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,a year ago,Lovely spot. Had a brunch here with hubby and our son. They have good food choices! I bet it's romantic at night.
11,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Little Ibiza of Amsterdam, as they call it! Extremely nice place for a  beach- break ‚õ± to hang out with a friend, organize a meet up or celebrate üçæ Very diverse team, great food & drinks menu, water and green area all around the place!"
12,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool place, nice location. The food was good! Ordering via the app worked very well."
13,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The boathouse is the best part of Strand Zuid. Although walking on the sand-side is also fun. Why not give a party here?
14,Strandzuid, 1 star ,a year ago,Dirty glasses. Some are extremely dirty (other person's lipstick on it). Staff had some excuse about a machine not working and them not having the time to clean them properly. That's just nonsense of course. You should serve in clean ‚Ä¶
15,Strandzuid, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The food Is delicious. The servers are friendly enough. Beautiful location in or out. The service can be extremely slow.
16,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Must Visit when in Amsterdam. Great atmosphere, good food and a really relaxed vibe. It's the best kept secret in town. Perfect for a sunny day or a date."
17,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,3 years ago,There‚Äôs a ‚Äòbeach‚Äô area where you can have a seat on sand. Spacious. No cocktails and homemade soft drinks though
18,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely place to hang out in the sun. Service is a little slow however.

20,Strandzuid, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Overpriced place with poor service and basic food.

21,Strandzuid, 3 stars ,9 months ago,I visited strandzuid the other day to enjoy the sunny Amsterdam weather. The ambiance of the place is really nice and is perfect for a sunny day. The staff was pretty friendly as-well. The snacks and drinks however are a little pricey! I ‚Ä¶

24,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Always a lovely vibe here, but with the sun out this spot is really special. I like that the setting is just as appropriate for an evening hangout with friends as it is for a romantic dinner as it is for a work lunch. I try to avoid the ‚Ä¶"

Perfect location for an amazing bday!
Highly recommended"
31,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Love this place. The flat bread, caesar Salad and scenery is lovely for conversation and catch up with friends. Amazing vibe."
32,Strandzuid, 2 stars ,a year ago,The hygiene is worrying me. I wonder if they wash their cups. Full of lip marks. During Corona time I really don't want drink from these kind of cups... The waiter didn't bring knife and forks after 2 times asking... The only good point is the fake sand area.
33,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, pretty staff, Fine environment."
34,Strandzuid, 1 star ,a year ago,"We ordered two martini fiero spritz. First two were perfect. However when it got crowded, the second round we got served wrong drinks. After we complained we were told that it‚Äôs the same drink just a different glass. We had to get up, go to ‚Ä¶"

37,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice bar at the water. The food was good, but with some room for improvement. The service was friendly and fast.

38,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice decoration and beautiful view on a small lake!
39,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Super location. Close to metros, buses, taxis etc. Has a beach restaurant feel but then in the middle of the busy city. Friendly staff. I had a company event there so I think the buffet was handled by an external catering company, not sure. ‚Ä¶"
40,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Well organized location with good possibilities for a good party!

They had excellent service and sound systems. We were able to light a bonfire ‚Ä¶"
41,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We hosted a party for about 300 guests here. Great place, good ambiance and good food. We had an awesome party!"
42,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great little gem in Amsterdam. Near the RAI conference center this is an excellent place to host events. The place offers sand, beds and chairs. Just like a real beach club would offer. We have not tried the food, however, all the regular drinks are available."
43,Strandzuid, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Good for drinks on a sunny day
44,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best location in Amsterdam for beers and food if want to sit outside with friends. The selection of beers and wines is better than most and the swordfish from the josper grill is outstanding!
45,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Beautiful place with a nice atmosphere. The service was quite slow, but friendly."
46,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Great service, big beers, nice app to order with. But also the smelliest toilets üòÅ"
47,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent location with picnic tables, bean bags, couches and more comfortable tables along the water, and highly recommended to make a reservation for a table at the water for a sunny day. The service can be slow and dishes are simple, however. I've repeatedly noticed that the beers are not very cold."
48,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice view, they could make sure all they sell is in stock.. Unfortunately we ordered some stuff that wasn't available because they didn't counted on so much people... A bit disappointing but still loved the place!"
49,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Nice view with good selection of beers and wines
50,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place to grab a drink if you‚Äôre nearby.
51,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice location, a bit hidden in an Expo compound. Food is good, not spectacular, but not bad either. Large selection of Drinks. I wouldnt go for the food alone, but if you are looking for a nice location it will work."
52,Strandzuid, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Such a pity that this place is crappy service and food what is wat overpriced. You get a device when your food is ready and told us to pick it up at the bar. So we did, then they shouted we had to go to a different bar. 10 minutes before he ‚Ä¶"
53,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Before going to this place my wife and myself checked out the reviews.
This did not make for good reading
And we were 50/50 about even trying it. ‚Ä¶"
54,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,a year ago,The bar/restaurant was very nice and gorgeous. the kitchen closed at 9:30 but it wasn‚Äôt mentioned on the menu or the staff didn‚Äôt tell us about it. So keep that in mind.
55,Strandzuid, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Though the food is very good, the service really could be improved."
56,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,5 years ago,When the season is open it's just wonderful to have a drink after work on a Friday with friends or colleagues on this recreated beach on an artificial lake next to Beatrixpark. The views are beautiful and the atmosphere is relaxed: the ‚Ä¶
57,Strandzuid, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Bad experience, shame as was considering as location for party of 200. Food was over priced and cold, fries cold and greasy, bar man had such an attitude/not friendly. Unable to take advantage of lounge sets as full of teens (no signs of drinks etc!). High expectations for a great lunch and didn't deliver. Left immediately after food."
58,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Bar with multiple areas. In winter only open for events. In summer there's a small area with sand so expect some people sunbathing. Nice place if the weather is good.
59,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Huge caf√©-restaurant with great outdoor space. You can sit your feet in the sand, or sit back in front of the canal, or simply enjoy a beer on the covered outdoor terrasse while watching the football cup. Be aware, drinks are served in plastic cups since we are all barefeet."
60,Strandzuid, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Strand Zuid is an unique place to visit. Its located surrounded by RAI Amsterdam convention centre. Corporate locals go here mainly from the Zuidas for a lunch or a drink after work.The place looks like a beach, it has the same facilities. ‚Ä¶"
61,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Always cosy. Recommend to reserve table in advance.
62,Strandzuid, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful venue in a good location, but the service is so slow that I would never eat here again just to avoid dealing with table service. If you get your drinks from the bar it's fine."
63,Strandzuid, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Terrible service. The table is being IGNOREd, impossible to even place the order !!!!"
64,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing fish, great nachos and kids friendly place. Stuff aren't super fast though and the restaurant gets a bit too loud as you are in a bar."
65,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"In the summertime this is an awesome place to while away a few hours in the sun. Picturesque location beside a small lake on the edge of Beatrix Park.  Large open air bar, sun loungers,  table tennis, sand volleyball courts & more. Good Food."
66,Strandzuid, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Improved setting and decor. Nice to be on the water and have snacks and a drink. Menu is not great but okay. Service also okay.
67,Strandzuid, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Great location next to a small pond in the city but too crowded (especially Friday evening), too popular and way too overpriced. So no, I would not recommend going here for drinks unless you cannot avoid this strategic location."
68,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very, very nice place. I went at night during winter for a Heineken after work party, I guess that during the summer is a hot spot as there are good spots to sit outside and enjoy the sun and the small lake outside."
69,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very cool vibe. Nice food. Accomodating to allergies. Service was very... 'casual'
70,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice vibe from this place. Feels like a little beach in Spain üòä

72,Strandzuid, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Downside of digitalisation: they introduced a gorgeous app - the only way to order, but it didn‚Äôt work!?! Huge self-made complexity which caused long waiting times and a lot of persuasive efforts to get things on the table."
73,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Really nice location some good local beers.

75,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, very fast food service, expensive food for what it is"

78,Strandzuid, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very comfortable restaurant.
79,Strandzuid, 3 stars ,a year ago,It was ok.  Nice and interesting location behind the RAI. Service a bit slow. Food pretty good.
80,Strandzuid, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"It's expensive prices are justified at one of the 4 organized parties (4.5‚Ç¨ for a long neck), but not at any other time. So check its calendar or the weather forecast and choose deliberately weather to visit this place."
81,Strandzuid, 1 star ,a year ago,one of the best locations with expensive barely edible food and arrogant service.... what a let down

83,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very nice location and good food but service could be improved.
84,Strandzuid, 2 stars ,3 years ago,During IBC event at RAI Ceasar salad costs almost 15 euros. Mmm... the same one from AH costs about 3.5 - 4. Rather excpensive like for street food.

87,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Nice place for Sunday brunch !!
88,Strandzuid, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible burgers. Seriously some of the worst food we had in amsterdam and I agree with the other reviewer, overpriced! If you care at all about your food then avoid this place like the plague."
89,Strandzuid, 4 stars ,8 months ago,In the weekdays popular spot to meet after work with a drink and a bite.
