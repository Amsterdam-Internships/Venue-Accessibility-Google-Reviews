0,Titus Parrilla, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"The food was very delicious but had to wait quite some time for the it. They brought the soup and the steak together, so my steak got a little cold while eating the soup. The service was very kind and helpful and the toilets were also neat."
1,Titus Parrilla, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"There are several steakhouses doing cheap tourist menus in Amsterdam and my boring friends decided to basically have the same food every single night. This was the best, at least food-wise. The pepper steak was surprisingly good, really excellent for the price. The staff was friendly and they have heaters outside"
2,Titus Parrilla, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Stopped here for breakfast one morning. Nice speedy service and friendly waitress. Toilets are at the back up the stairs. The food was fine and so was the coffee. Nice location to sit and watch the world go past in rembrant square.
3,Titus Parrilla, 1 star ,6 months ago,Horrible restaurant. A must avoid. Hopeless service. Took 1.5 hours for the food to come. Taste was just ok. They don't accept pin. You can only pay by cash. Would not go back if someone would pay me to!
4,Titus Parrilla, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Visited here for an evening meal for a hen parry.  Considering we were a large group of women restaurant was able to provide really goo service to us all! ‚Ä¶
5,Titus Parrilla, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food and service, steak was amazing, burger slightly burned but amazing taste. More on the expensive side, but definitely worth it"
6,Titus Parrilla, 5 stars ,8 months ago,The food was really good I guess the best steak ever end the staff was olso very friendly it's a nice place for having food end drinks I really enjoy it.
7,Titus Parrilla, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good food. Great location. Little pricey.
8,Titus Parrilla, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Titus Parilla was not the best restaurant we visited in Amsterdam. The tomato soup was OK, but the hamburger wasn't so nice. A little bit dry and very juicy. Most of the waiters were not so friendly."
9,Titus Parrilla, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Nice food. Nice beers. Nice place.
10,Titus Parrilla, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"A nicely located restaurant in a busy yet chilled area. The food was quite a disaster. My friend's steak came cold and my Caesar salad was totally off. I never experienced a Caesar salad with arugula, tomatoes & cucumbers, and no Parmesan. The dressing was a ready made one instead of the one made from scratch. Too bad!"
11,Titus Parrilla, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Service is great!  Food is ok. Had ""Tapas"". Onion rings and calamari rings were terrible. Ribs were ok , boiled with sauce added. Chorizo was good. Chicken wings were the best part of the dish. BUT. The beer is cold and the view is great."
12,Titus Parrilla, 4 stars ,5 years ago,We had dinner for NYE. The grilled chicken was good. Side of salad was odd with no dressing provided. Great place to people watch Rembrandt Square across the street.
13,Titus Parrilla, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great place to sit and people watch in the square. Nice lunch and good beer.
14,Titus Parrilla, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Wrong food brought to our table 3 times, steak arrived under cooked, and suspected not to be tenderloin that was ordered. Steak was recooked after I requested. Seemed expensive for what it was. Poor experience, I won't be back"
15,Titus Parrilla, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Titus Parillas is absolutely gorgeous!

18,Titus Parrilla, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Little bit pricy, but worth the money..."
19,Titus Parrilla, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Meat was totally rare. My gf got cold vegetables from the freezer called ""wild vegetables"". Too pricy for all products. Tourist trap."

51,Titus Parrilla, 1 star ,5 months ago,"(Translated by Google) I would never come back again. For the price you can eat a lot better; First it was that the food was wrongly served, then there was still a lot of hair in it and we were not served for a long time. üò† ‚Ä¶"
