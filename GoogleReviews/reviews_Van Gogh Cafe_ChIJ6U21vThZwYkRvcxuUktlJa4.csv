1,Van Gogh Cafe, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Located in the museum, love the drip coffee there."
2,Van Gogh Cafe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Van Gogh Cafe is located in the welcome center of Ground For Sculpture. The roof was the painting of Van Gogh - ‚ÄúThe Starry Night ‚Äú in digital format. ‚Ä¶
3,Van Gogh Cafe, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Staff are always friendly and helpful. You get your orders quickly and meals are always tasty. They are fairly priced. There's so much art to check out while you're there. Outdoor dining here is always a great time with stunning views. It's a great place to take a quick lunch break and relax.

10,Van Gogh Cafe, 5 stars ,11 months ago,The food was excellent and the atmosphere was pleasant. Very rustic feel. There was no bar waiting area but that is likely temporary due to covid.

12,Van Gogh Cafe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Coffee is so so view is gorgeous.
13,Van Gogh Cafe, 3 stars ,a year ago,Not what i expected from a cafe. Hot drinks barely luke warm and limited snack offerings. Wait til you leave the Grounds for Sculpture and just find a Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts.
14,Van Gogh Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to relax after touring the gardens, especially on a cold afternoon!"
