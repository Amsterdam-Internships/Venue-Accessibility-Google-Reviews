0,Kebab House, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Amazing kebab place to order! Everything super fresh and food arrives warm to your door. They never disappoint me, such amazing flavours and huuuge portions!! Thank you team!"
1,Kebab House, 1 star ,a week ago,"Terrible service, failed to deliver orders, Kapsalon lacks sauce and flavor, all in all, a mediocre establishment that can only make money because the patronage is too drunk to realize that the service and product are both complete drivel. I would highly recommend Dalyan over Kebab House"
2,Kebab House, 1 star ,a month ago,Ordered food via uber eats. Waited 40 minutes then the order was cancelled. Tried calling them four times but no answer. Had to get my money back by calling uber. Would not recommend
3,Kebab House, 1 star ,4 months ago,Ordered food via uber eats. It took over an hour to prepare the food and the delivery never actually arrived to my home. When i called asking about my food they didn't care at all to help me (other restaurants always contact the driver in …
4,Kebab House, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Terrible experience, the staff is extremely rude, at one point the owner even got angry at me because I insisted in having no tomato in my kebab. The prices posted outside the shop are fake and significantly lower than the real ones! Avoid at all costs!!"
5,Kebab House, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Really bad quality. Small portion for the price. Wrap shoarma was really dry, almost no sauce, no taste. Fries also really dry(plus hair). Charged me more then the menu was. Really regret buying here!"

11,Kebab House, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food here isn't bad but the prices are on the upper end of what a quick eatery in Amsterdam would be priced at. Also, the owner tells you that if you use visa or mastercard they will charge the commission to you saying its a fixed 2 …"

20,Kebab House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I think the only thing left on my European checklist for my time in Amsterdam (and Belgium) was enjoying a cone of fries. This restaurant did not disappoint. They were made to order topped with my chosen sauces. The Samurai sauce hit the …

22,Kebab House, 3 stars ,3 years ago,It was okay.... I got really sick from the food but it tasted good. Hubby was unimpressed.
23,Kebab House, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The service here is the best. My only disappointment is that the chicken hotwings are always too oily, and I've brought them multiple times to be sure that it wasn't just a one time thing. The fries and everything else are very good"

28,Kebab House, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Durum Kebab wrap is pretty pkay but fries are too samll, way overpriced for the service. They even ask me to pay for Mayonnaise for 50ct. If the price was a bit cheaper this would acceptable!"

35,Kebab House, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Obviously nobody is expecting deluxe service from a kebab place, but kebab house really manages to take it to the next level by charging you about 50% over menu prices for no reason. Unless you want to pay 10 euros for two portions of fries, avoid this sleazy den of thieves."

39,Kebab House, 1 star ,2 months ago,It was terrible and terrible and terrible. DONT GO THERE.
40,Kebab House, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ignore the prices displayed. The price you'll be charged has little to no relevance. Ordering is more like a lucky dip of placing your hand into your wallet, throwing notes out like confetti, and praying some form of food materialises."
41,Kebab House, 1 star ,3 years ago,Guy behind the counter asked me more for the ordered dinner then was stated on the price list behind him. When confronted he still wanted to recieve the amount he made up on the spot... Walked out and will never go back. So shouldnt you.
