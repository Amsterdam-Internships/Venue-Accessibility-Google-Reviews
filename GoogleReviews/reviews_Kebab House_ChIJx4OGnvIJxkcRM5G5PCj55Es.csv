0,Kebab House, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Amazing kebab place to order! Everything super fresh and food arrives warm to your door. They never disappoint me, such amazing flavours and huuuge portions!! Thank you team!"
1,Kebab House, 1 star ,a week ago,"Terrible service, failed to deliver orders, Kapsalon lacks sauce and flavor, all in all, a mediocre establishment that can only make money because the patronage is too drunk to realize that the service and product are both complete drivel. I would highly recommend Dalyan over Kebab House"
2,Kebab House, 1 star ,a month ago,Ordered food via uber eats. Waited 40 minutes then the order was cancelled. Tried calling them four times but no answer. Had to get my money back by calling uber. Would not recommend
3,Kebab House, 1 star ,4 months ago,Ordered food via uber eats. It took over an hour to prepare the food and the delivery never actually arrived to my home. When i called asking about my food they didn't care at all to help me (other restaurants always contact the driver in ‚Ä¶
4,Kebab House, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Terrible experience, the staff is extremely rude, at one point the owner even got angry at me because I insisted in having no tomato in my kebab. The prices posted outside the shop are fake and significantly lower than the real ones! Avoid at all costs!!"
5,Kebab House, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Really bad quality. Small portion for the price. Wrap shoarma was really dry, almost no sauce, no taste. Fries also really dry(plus hair). Charged me more then the menu was. Really regret buying here!"
6,Kebab House, 5 stars ,a month ago,The best kapsalon in the coty
7,Kebab House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Tasty Halal Food. A lot of options to choose from. This meal costed me 12Euros but there are some less expensive options available as well.
8,Kebab House, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Positive: Food taste is good.

They served falafel , doner , sizzling chicken also rice.   It's nice with quick service."
10,Kebab House, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food was alright but overpriced. The yoghurt sauce was stale and sour. Wouldn't have been here if it wasn't to use the toilet there.
11,Kebab House, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food here isn't bad but the prices are on the upper end of what a quick eatery in Amsterdam would be priced at. Also, the owner tells you that if you use visa or mastercard they will charge the commission to you saying its a fixed 2 ‚Ä¶"

14,Kebab House, 1 star ,6 months ago,"WRONG ORDER : The Chef did a mistake in my order that I noticed, and the manager lied in front of me because he didn‚Äôt want to change it.

17,Kebab House, 5 stars ,11 months ago,The food is tasty and the portions are very generous. The twister fries were amazing. The delivery arrived super fast and they gave some free dessert :)
18,Kebab House, 1 star ,10 months ago,I saw the old man who wears glasses being extremely arrogant rude and abusive to the delivery guy. Shameful on you losers. ‚Ä¶
19,Kebab House, 5 stars ,a year ago,I ordered beef broodje sandwich and a chicken durum wrap. I am a big eater and have a good appetite. The portion was big! Therefore it was value for money. The food is delicious to say the least. I also got a surprised with a sweet ending! Baklava!!!!!! Omg! Thank you guys. Your food and generosity touched my heart!
20,Kebab House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I think the only thing left on my European checklist for my time in Amsterdam (and Belgium) was enjoying a cone of fries. This restaurant did not disappoint. They were made to order topped with my chosen sauces. The Samurai sauce hit the ‚Ä¶
21,Kebab House, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Tried to charge more than menu price because they were busy, tried to claim I was ordering the small, which isn't an option for durums. Trying to take advantage of customers late at night"
22,Kebab House, 3 stars ,3 years ago,It was okay.... I got really sick from the food but it tasted good. Hubby was unimpressed.
23,Kebab House, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The service here is the best. My only disappointment is that the chicken hotwings are always too oily, and I've brought them multiple times to be sure that it wasn't just a one time thing. The fries and everything else are very good"
24,Kebab House, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Severely average, overpriced food. Smoking owner in the doorway didn't particularly solve the quality issues as well. ‚Ä¶"
25,Kebab House, 4 stars ,a year ago,"If you're in the Pijp area and craving kebab, this is a good place to stop at. Don't expect any luxuries, but you get decent food and quantity for your money. Had the Kapsalon, very tasty! üëç"
26,Kebab House, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Food was on the small side but tasted decent. Charged an additional euro by the owner which is ridiculous for a 12 euro bill.

27,Kebab House, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Not the best place to eat but not that bad neither
28,Kebab House, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Durum Kebab wrap is pretty pkay but fries are too samll, way overpriced for the service. They even ask me to pay for Mayonnaise for 50ct. If the price was a bit cheaper this would acceptable!"
29,Kebab House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm eating but it is the best thing I‚Äôve ever eaten. Clean plate club forreal.

34,Kebab House, 1 star ,a year ago,"aweful service, the worker added 4‚Ç¨ on the bill for nothing,
he served us meat instead for chicken that we ordered just because it cost more. ‚Ä¶"
35,Kebab House, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Obviously nobody is expecting deluxe service from a kebab place, but kebab house really manages to take it to the next level by charging you about 50% over menu prices for no reason. Unless you want to pay 10 euros for two portions of fries, avoid this sleazy den of thieves."
36,Kebab House, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great food. Not sure why other reviews say something wrong with the price. They guys didn't even wanna charge us anything. Price was decent too!
37,Kebab House, 1 star ,2 years ago,Service was quite bad. Cashier was a bit pushy to upsell a bigger portion. In general poor quality of meat (dry and salty). Would not recommend.
38,Kebab House, 1 star ,5 years ago,"If I could give them Zero I would.
Way over priced.
Staff clearly taking advantage of tourists  making up card charges for non Dutch ‚Ä¶"
39,Kebab House, 1 star ,2 months ago,It was terrible and terrible and terrible. DONT GO THERE.
40,Kebab House, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ignore the prices displayed. The price you'll be charged has little to no relevance. Ordering is more like a lucky dip of placing your hand into your wallet, throwing notes out like confetti, and praying some form of food materialises."
41,Kebab House, 1 star ,3 years ago,Guy behind the counter asked me more for the ordered dinner then was stated on the price list behind him. When confronted he still wanted to recieve the amount he made up on the spot... Walked out and will never go back. So shouldnt you.
42,Kebab House, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good and fast service, food is always good. One of the best (and underrated) kebab places in de Pijp."
43,Kebab House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Stuff is polite and patatos are tasty.
44,Kebab House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I am Indonesian. The taste is almost similar to Indonesian cuisine, but a little salty and I really like it. Prices are in accordance with the portion served."
45,Kebab House, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Very overpriced low quality food, combined with rude employees make for a terrible kebab shop. One of the worst I've ever been to. ‚Ä¶"
46,Kebab House, 1 star ,2 years ago,Service is at the lowest level. Quality of the food is not the best! Total experience is negative! Better to go to McDonalds 100 meters up the street!
47,Kebab House, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good place. Food was nice. Little salty but tasted good otherwise. The staff was friendly. Reasonable prices as well.
48,Kebab House, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The food was good. The place is a little small and does not have toilets. Prices cheap. You get what you pay for.
49,Kebab House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Real deal kebab shop in a super hip neighborhood. Kebabs were tasty and the owner was gracious. Prices are very reasonable.

53,Kebab House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Kapsalon was really tasty!
54,Kebab House, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Personally I had a good time, the food is good for a decent price.the only problem is the staff don't speak English too well so you have to be patient but at the end it'll be worth."
55,Kebab House, 1 star ,6 years ago,"I say alot of ants walking on the table, in the wall and on my napkins!
Also sometimes they put WAY to much oil or dont fil the bread proper. ‚Ä¶"
