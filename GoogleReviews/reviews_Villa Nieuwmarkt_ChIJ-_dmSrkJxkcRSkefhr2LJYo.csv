1,Villa Nieuwmarkt, 1 star ,5 months ago,"The place was cozy and in a wonderful place in Amsterdam, and there was a cat. The staff serving was also very kind. That were the good things about it. My boyfriend and I went to get some nachos. The guacamole seemed canned and expired, it …"
2,Villa Nieuwmarkt, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Food was okay although the waitress dropped half a hot cheesy toastie on my leg and didn't apologise just went and got another one.
3,Villa Nieuwmarkt, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Very cosy place. Ride in front of the train station. They have a very good drinks and beer. Their caffee late is very delicious.

15,Villa Nieuwmarkt, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Went for lunch. Food was good and a large portion. I had the Satay Chicken which is a Dutch specialty. Price was fair too. Only down side is that it was empty with no atmosphere. Would try it again if I was out that way. It is in the middle of nowhere so not many other options in this area so give it a go.
16,Villa Nieuwmarkt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, decent price. Bathrooms were very dirty however. That was the only downside. The waiters were very nice although a few of them seemed like it was there first day. Some waiters didn’t speak any Dutch, which annoyed some other customers."
17,Villa Nieuwmarkt, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Decent small bar with a decent selection of draught beers. We stopped in for a pint and we liked it. It's not over priced given it's proximity to its surroundings. I'd recommend it for sure if you just want a beer while perusing the neighborhood. 😉
18,Villa Nieuwmarkt, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Price ok for central Amsterdam, but the blonde waiter with ponytail on top of head is very irritated and makes sarcastic/rude comments after customers leave the bar area. We were sitting by the bar so we heard it all. The other restaurants had wonderful wait staff. Would not suggest visiting. There are better places around town!"

Atmosphere is very authentic as well, lovely. …"
20,Villa Nieuwmarkt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Found by accident after walking by De Waag we found this small but cozy place. The guy that received us, a very sympathetic Czech fella who speaks 8 or 9 idioms made our waiting here much more happy. Simple meals and affordable prices."

34,Villa Nieuwmarkt, 1 star ,8 years ago,I had lamb with green vegetables and port sauce. The sauce was heavy with unvaporised alcohol. Lamb racks were over cooked and chewy. These guys can't cook.
35,Villa Nieuwmarkt, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Mehhhh!! Price ok for central Dam, I know that service work is hard, and the public can be irritating, but it's not hard to not be sarcastic and generally have a little bit of a nicer front to customers."
