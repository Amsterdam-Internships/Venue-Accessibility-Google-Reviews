0,Ciel Bleu, 4 stars ,4 months ago,All in all it was a great evening. Got to see the sunset during the meal and nice concept with all the different spices around the world. There were several dishes though that were overly salted and I thought three courses of dessert was a …
1,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had such a fantastic experience here. The food was amazing and the staff was wonderful. Fine dining really is about the experience as much as the food and this place delivered on both. There are also beautiful views of the city as you eat. I would say this restaurant is worth making a trip for even.
2,Ciel Bleu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The visit to Ciel Bleu started very well.
We were quickly taken up to the restaurant where we got to sit in the lounge and enjoy excellent food and view for a few minutes. …"
3,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Ciel Bleu is truly one of the most outstanding restaurants I've ever had the pleasure to dine at. My partner and I had the 'Guestronomy' taster menu for my 32nd birthday this week and it certainly went down a treat. …
4,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is deserving of 3 Michelin stars, not just two. Ciel Bleu is the best restaurant I have ever dined at. Everything fell into place: each dish of the tasting menu was out of this world, the service was friendly and flawless, the …"
5,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Exceptional **Michelin restaurant. Service and presentation deserving of a 3rd star.  It is located on the top floor of a hotel so it has a wonderful view. Degustation menu options, with full wine pairing option available. Fresh ingredients and delicious. Overall a wonderful experience."
6,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food, really in a special way prepared.  The waiters know so much about all the wines and dishes and they  just tell you in such a nice way...loved it! Worth every cent."
7,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good restaurant with top notch service. Food is of the highest quality. Views from the 23th floor over Amsterdam are amazing. Definitely would recommend booking a room in the Okura hotel combined with a dinner at Ciel Bleu.
8,Ciel Bleu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I’ve never spent so much money to feel hungry.

The view is great, the service is great, and the presentation is fantastic. The …"

11,Ciel Bleu, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Just don't go, it's not worth the money. When we went the only options available were Waegu Beef (for an extra €250+) or pigeon. We chose the pigeon, not truly thinking we would see it's relatives for the rest of the trip. One of the …"

13,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is an amazing experience! I would say the best I've add so far! The balance of all flavor's are impacable. I felt full at the end and didn't have the need to stop somewhere to grab a burger. The wine pairing experience is perfect and the staff are on top. Thanks again!!!
14,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"At the top floor of the 5* Okura Hotel Amsterdam you'll enjoy an amazing experience at Ciel Bleu. Seated in a beautiful decor of gentle black, soft grey and the natural touch of the Dutch Birch, the skyline of the Dutch Capital is your …"

16,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"An incredible experience.  Absolutely worth a visit.  Describing the dishes is pointless, you have to check it out yourself!"
17,Ciel Bleu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It's a good place to dine, good food, good service and good produce. It's a place to go once, but maybe that's about it. There's better offers in Amsterdan for the same price and quality."
18,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,a year ago,Greatest evening ever... special Thanks to the Sommelier  and the Maître... it was a pleasure to be there

22,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,a year ago,Fantastic views over Amsterdam. Food menu was amazing with the best wine selection I've ever had. Overall it may be expensive but totally worth it.
23,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"INCREDIBLE MEAL! My partner and I went here for dinner and had the gastronomy menu and it was to die for! The timing of the food, the wine pairing, the ambiance, everything was phenomenal. We’ve eaten at many Michelin star restaurants and this was definitely a top experience."
24,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Extraordinary experience in cuisine as well as service. The joy of tasting a variety of dishes with flavor combinations very new and so exquisite, leaves us very satisfied. Service was also equally high to accompany the high level of culinary delight."
25,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"This restaurant gives you a high-end quality for a very reasonable price. Probably one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The staff was so pleasant, and so engaging. The food was excellent, each course was well laid out. We had a 8 …"
26,Ciel Bleu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Overpriced , but yeah okay you pay for the experience eating in a 2* Michellin restaurant in Okura hotel in Amsterdam.. I enjoyed the Wyagu beef, the wine arrangement (not all were my favourite) and the selection of butter. This really …"

32,Ciel Bleu, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The restaurant had OK food in extremely small portions. The bread was tasty but I've had better. It's an extremely fancy restaurant with extremely high prices with just OK food. Trust me - you can eat better food in much larger portions for one fifth of the price..
33,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Truly lives upto its michelin stars. It's one of the best places in Amsterdam for a great dinner, amazing service and beautiful view of the city. The caviar is one of the specials of the place - make sure you try it out whilst there. …"
34,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Mind blowing culinary experience! Each dish here is a piece of art. Service, wine pairing, drinks and the view: all wonderful.  It is quite pricy but worth for an extraordinary experience. Michellin 2 star is very well deserved."
35,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Extremely pleased with everything - seating, view, staff, food. Absolutely brilliant! It lives up to the expectations, and even surpasses them. The thing that caught my attention is that even though it is an upscale restaurant, the staff were quite friendly, relaxed, and even witty, which was unexpected."
36,Ciel Bleu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The bread was good :)
Without it we would have stayed hungry.
Very small portions, kind of tastings, which can not be said about their prices. …"
37,Ciel Bleu, 4 stars ,5 years ago,They are good  but not up to my expectation as a two stars Michelin ranking. Wine pairing is not stunning  but the Sommelier can explain the wine great details . Overall is good and fine but not as authentic  as the the best food ought to be.
38,Ciel Bleu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I'm going to be picky here, because for a restaurant with 2 Michelin stars and the price tag which comes with that designation, things should be flawless and I should be blown away. They weren't, and I wasn't. …"
39,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Want to experience something really special? For let's say an anniversary or any other sort of celebration? Eat here. This is amazing. Unparalleled. The food is F A N T A S T I C, French cuisine with a hint of the orient, super creative, …"
40,Ciel Bleu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The place and Staff are awesome! I have never had this Kind of threatment. The food was really good and they gave us a tour in the kitchen after the sitting. Best place ever!
41,Ciel Bleu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I was a little disappointed with the food. I expected more fore the price.
The ambience, the view and the service were great. But that does not help if you come for the food."

46,Ciel Bleu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice views of the city on the 23/F, but the meal was too expensive for the mediocre and uninspiring food served at Ciel Bleu. For a restaurant with 2 Michelin stars, you will be better off eating at Librije's Zusje instead where the quality of the food blows this place out of the water."
