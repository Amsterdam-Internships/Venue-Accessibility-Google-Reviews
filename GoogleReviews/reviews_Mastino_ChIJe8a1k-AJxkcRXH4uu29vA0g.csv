0,Mastino, 4 stars ,a year ago,What a treat it was to go to eat at Mastino V! To find vegan and gluten-free pizzas as well as such delicious vegan & Gf deserts too was a real bonus. The friendly welcome from our host was much appreciated and I would recommend this place. ‚Ä¶
1,Mastino, 3 stars ,a year ago,"We came without a reservation, and they had no table for us, but they said to us we can sit on at the bar and wait if someone who made a reservation don't show up we can get this table. Lucky. So after 10 minuets the table was ours. The ‚Ä¶"
2,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love their pizzas, thick fluffy dough that was delicious!! The fact it's gluten free and vegan makes it even more amazing!!! The restaurant is small and cosy so book ahead if you need a table. Service was great, can be a bit slow to get the ‚Ä¶"
3,Mastino, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Pizzas are fantastic, nice flavor choices! Could be a 4 stars but we haven‚Äôt appreciated the service too much.. to long due to waiters talking too long with clients."

5,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Oh my goodness!!! I'm in love ‚ù§ A whole menu of gluten free and vegan pizza. I had a New Vegan pizza with vegan cheese, wafer thin sliced sweet and purple potato, courgette and courgette flowers and truffle. AMAZING!! I will be working myway through their menu. Thanks to all of you at Mastino"
6,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food! Best pizza I've had in a long time! Everything is gluten free! Even the beer! And the owners are lovely people! I'll definitely return for more.

8,Mastino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great tasting gluten free and vegan pizza!

First place we‚Äôve found that has nut free and soy free cheese options!!  Great ‚Ä¶"
9,Mastino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is really good and the menu offers interesting option such as the Red Velvet (beetroot and avocado on a pizza) good desserts as well. The staff is really friendly but the interior design is not the best in the table area. Btw, almost entirely Vegan and Gluten Free!! Great stuff"

11,Mastino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very bad pizza base. Was very thick, wet and undercooked. The crust was browned giving the illusion that it was cooked but was nearly impossible to pick up a slice it was that soft and spongy. ‚Ä¶"
12,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Pizza was really good and tasty, not so far from pizza with gluten,i tried a classic one(margherita),base was crunchy and all the ingredients enhanced the tast of it, really good job, staff very attentive and friendly, if you looking for a gluten free and vegan pizza  you can't miss this place!We will back again!"
13,Mastino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing gluten free pizza bread, the best I‚Äôve ever tried anywhere in the world!!! I had the vegan veggie and it was so delicious, you would never think the cheese was vegan. Also excellent customer service.. definitely going back and highly recommend üòã"

16,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,So delicious gluten free pizza! Highly recommend!
17,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had the most delicious GF pizza along with a glass of wine and a glass of kombucha. Service was super friendly. Try the current oizza of the month- mushroom! It‚Äôs a white pizza with truffle oil. Amazing.
18,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best vegan pizzas (and gluten free) I've ever had! We come from Leiden but when in Amsterdam we always get one!

20,Mastino, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The pizza is a rip-off the cheese has a strong taste and slimy texture. The dough tastes like a sponge.
If you to eat in house you have to use one way cutlery, cardboard cups and pizza ‚Ä¶"
21,Mastino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing pizzas! The cheeses are sooo creamy and tasty. Try the Big 4: it's excellent! We're gonna come back to try all the others :)
22,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"All the tables are on the  upper-level, so you have to walk up about a dozen narrow stairs - therefore not wheelchair accessible.  There is  a counter area that you could sit at though at street level.  The vegan pesto on The Love Pizza was ‚Ä¶"
23,Mastino, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food, all gluten-free and vegan! Lovely place with lovely service and very tasty pizzas! Unfortunately it's quite expensive, it's very small (it's officially a take-out so only 5 tables) and they don't serve alcohol. Also the food is served on carton boxes and with plastic cuttlery"

26,Mastino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Normally I really dislike vegan cheese but really amazing pizza! Even my two non vegan friends really liked it! Also great atmosphere
27,Mastino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It was my first Vegan experience. It was great. The flavours  beautiful and the place felt like home, withba litlle mistique"
28,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Love this place! Vegan place yet gluten free pizzazz. Newstyled life people place. Real italianüëåüèº
29,Mastino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Gluten free, vegan pizza's which are THE BEST ever. I made it a rule to make a monthly visit."
30,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Had one of the best pizzas of my life. My fianc√© and I are vegan and we‚Äôre truly amazed by these pizzas. The cheese melted perfectly, the food was so fresh and the service was incredible. Thank you Novella! ‚Ä¶"
31,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,So delicious gluten free pizza! Highly recommend!

33,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love Mastino! In a very special area of Amsterdam, you will find this vegan, gluten-free Italian jewel!
It's a pizzeria with all kinds of vegan pizzas. The service is super nice, ‚Ä¶"
34,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really nice service and pizza!!! For people who complain, 1 when you go to a gluten-free and vegan place it is normal that you are served that, do not be surprised that there is no normal meat or pizza, otherwise go to any pizzeria.  2 ‚Ä¶"
35,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great pizza and great brownie! The staff are really wonderful too!! I was so happy to find a place with so many gluten free options and yes the other reviews are accurate maybe the best gluten free pizza crust ever. Can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs vegan although they do offer regular cheese you don‚Äôt miss it at all. I will definitely be returning.
36,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This pizza is a work of art. They have a big selection of vegan cheese and such a rich menu! You'll need time to choose one pizza. The pizza is kinda big (8 slices) and they have ginger juice among the soft drinks. It is delicious! (perfect for summer). Great service and cozy environment.
37,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really great experience. From the start the menu looks a little expensive, but it is WORTH EVERY EURO. We got the New Vegan and the Love. Both pizzas wouldn‚Äôt be a thing without the dough. Whoever is behind that has struck gold. It‚Äôs got an ‚Ä¶"
38,Mastino, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We visited this place a couple of times. And each time the taste of dough of the pizzas is improved. My friend had a pizza with eggplant and he said he was very full and it was yummy. I had a Caprese salad, it had only 4 tiny pieces a ‚Ä¶"
39,Mastino, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Look ive eaten at Mastino before a handful of times and it was 10/10. Last night I ate at their new (?) Location and it wasn't good. Before it seemed all the toppings were prepared and marinated with love. Last night the veggies were super ‚Ä¶
40,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had foccacia bread with truffle and the love pizza with spinach. All very tasty and interesting engaging flavours. Cheesecake was really nice. All dishes are vegan and gluten free but not one bit less tasty!
41,Mastino, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"ATTENTION! This pizza does not taste like pizza, it tastes like a pancake. Sweet and soft. I do not like pancakes with veggies, for me pancakes should be sweet, so this means I did not enjoy this pizza. Be aware before of this before you go; I guess if you like pancakes with veggies then you might like it! :)"
42,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing Glutenfree pizza! I wish there were more options on the Uber Eats menu but everything I've tried I've loved. Keep up the great work! Also some confusion on vegan brownies and glutenfree brownies when order as they are all groped ‚Ä¶
43,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My husband can not have gluten due to celiac disease and he chooses also to be vegan. In Amsterdam it is very hard to find both GF and vegan food until we found Mastino's. Really great menu with many tasty sounding pizzas. We got one to ‚Ä¶
44,Mastino, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing staff and place, but pizza was really avarage. Dough was really hard, cheese was not melted. Pizza was really dry and definitely overpriced. I get amazing gluten free and vegan pizza in London for ¬£9. I had bigger expectations  for ‚Ä¶"
45,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The entire menu is vegan and even as a eat-whatever-i-want kinda guy, the she-ta-ki pizza is probably the best one i ever tasted. absolutely recommend it. staff is very open and friendly too."
46,Mastino, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Despicable, despicable excuse for a pizza. We've had great vegan pizzas before, but this just didn't make the cut (literally they didn't even cut our pizza into slices). Overpriced, flat and tasteless crust, stingy portions. The pathetic ‚Ä¶"
47,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This gluten-free place is bellisimo! Very friendly staff, good atmosphere, pizza's thats taste delicious! Fresh made gluten-free pizza with a very tasteful dough, and very fresh and beautiful toppings. We ordered several types and shared. ‚Ä¶"
48,Mastino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is the best gluten free pizza in Amsterdam. Not only that, but all of the pizzas are gluten free. The dough is crispy and chewy, like real pizza. The flavor is divine. I would eat there everyday if I lived in Amsterdam. I HIGHLY ‚Ä¶"
49,Mastino, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Pizzas were ok and full of veggies, the dough was a bit weird and not so tasty. The staff acted weird when i asked for one of the pizzas with vegan cheese for it to be without it, and they simply pointed to another pizza and gave me that. ‚Ä¶"
50,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Dinner time for our family. A Ceoliac kid and GF intolerance dad, and two normal.
Warm friendly welcome and straight to our table, we had booked. Good selection ‚Ä¶"
51,Mastino, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and friendly service however unfortunately I wouldn't recommend the pizza. The vegan cheese lacks any flavour as does the sauce. If you are vegan and celiac it's worth checking out, however, if you don't have dietary requirements I'd opt for another pizza point."
52,Mastino, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Staff weren't outright rude but we didn't receive much of a welcome or interest in us, and they were obviously unprepared to be as busy as it was so were a little flustered and forgetful. We waited for a small time then had to order more ‚Ä¶"
53,Mastino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Locally made vegan cheeses adorn these exquisitely made pizzas that taste like they are just out of heaven. Unbelievable for something that is gluten-free! You will not miss the difference. The staff and owners are lovely and the interior ‚Ä¶
54,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Just ate here and it was so delicious. I am definitely not vegan and I love gluten but my best friend has celiac and due to other food allergies has a vegan diet. This makes it difficult to find restaurants she can eat at without having an ‚Ä¶
55,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Yummy vegan pizza! The staff was also exceptional!!! Cheers all around üôÇ

One star out of five is even too much for rating this place, which is neither a ‚Ä¶"
57,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really amazing gluten free (and vegan) pizza!! Great service, too."
58,Mastino, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I was very surprised pizza was so good being vegan and gluten free. Desserts were amaizing, the best brownie I've had even compared with regular ones. The only thing is it's a bit overpriced for being vegan I think."
59,Mastino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst pizza ever. No customer service at all, rude answers and no refunds.
The slices were way too chewy and oily. The crust was Literally uncooked.
Just a gross and overpriced experience. ‚Ä¶"
60,Mastino, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The good:
-	Very clean
-	Good quality ingredients ‚Ä¶"
61,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Most amazing gluten free and vegan pizza in the world. It was so tasty. The crust was nice and fluffy and yet still crunchy. It's gluten free and vegan heaven there :) they even have gluten free beers and the buckwheat one was very nice and light. Had a great time there.
62,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent pizzas.  The quality was so high that my son (type 1 diabetic) had stable blood glucose levels throughout the night.
The vegan cheese with pesto was also exquisite."
63,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious pizza! I normally eat gluten & I am normally eat diary. Nonetheless I absolutely enjoyed the pizza's (with guacamole and the other one with spinach). There is an option to eat actual mozarella. Pistachio cheesecake was also very good.
64,Mastino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very friendly and open people who work there. Ordered a pizza for take-away. I was really excited about the pizza, but i have never been a fan about vegan cheese. But the pizzacrust was great. It's the best glutenfree i've ever had! But expensive though!"
65,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,"For those allergic to gluten or vegan people or even usual healthy people, the food is amazing. Pizzas, even gluten free, are as we know it in Italy-really fantastic. Decent prices, friendly environment, clean and...tasty. Highly recommended! 5 stars from me, my daughter and my wife."
66,Mastino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A really good vegan pizzeria place. Only downside is the waiting time to be seated (we had a reservation but it was a confused day for the waitress it seems) and the for the pizza. It was really busy so it's understandable. ‚Ä¶
67,Mastino, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very boring, bland food. Bad service. Literally didn‚Äôt say anything about how to pay; after we ordered they pretty much forgot we exited. Had no plates. Waitress was very rude to customers other than ourselves. And way overpriced. 20 USD for a small, four-piece pizza that had barely any flavor whatsoever. Don‚Äôt waste your time."
68,Mastino, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Best vegan pizza! The taste is amazing. Many different options. Interesting soft drinks. Have in mind that it is a take away place though. Sitting places are limited and pizza is served in cardboard boxes.
69,Mastino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Pizza was not be to eaten, half baked almost raw dough. The waiter (cute Italian girl) while greeting us poured an enormous puddle of spiritus cleaner on the table and wiped it off with a dirty washcloth. She kept doing it no matter of a ‚Ä¶"
70,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best gluten free and vegan pizza I've ever eaten! The staff were lovely and the atmosphere very gezellig! I'd highly recommend to any vegan/gluten  intolerant travellers!
71,Mastino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff. We had a salad with vegan pesto cheese that was very good. The 4 cheese pizza however was unusually sweet, not really a succes. The pizzas are pretty pricy as well."
72,Mastino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing vegan gluten free pizza! I am both vegan and gf, and this is by far the most outstanding pizza I've had. They are GF certified, don't use any non-gf products in their kitchen (coeliac friendly), and no animal products unless you ask ‚Ä¶"
73,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Febulous restaurant for vegan and people who are worried that vegan foods are not good. Mastino V do away with stereotypes.
74,Mastino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I really don't understand all the good reviews.  I wonder if the place is hiring people to write good reviews. I have had many gluten free, vegan pizzas and never has one tasted this bad.... I got a stomach ache afterwards. The dough tasted ‚Ä¶"
75,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My non-vegan family members prefer this place because the GF crust is better than regular crust, and doesn‚Äôt leave that oof I ate a pizza feeling, and they had no idea the cheese was vegan until I told them! Mastino V has nailed the perfect pizza, no matter what your food choices are otherwise."
76,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best, most amazing place for gluten pizza‚Äôs. The service is great. The host is a spanish fury and the little desertcakes are fenomenale. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the wide variety of pizzas. From quac to classics. Been there twice now. Coming back for sure. Wine good and not too expensive.
Lizzard and niek"
77,Mastino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The dough was really bad, the pizza really expensive and toppings didn't taste fresh (the avocado cream was digusting and the tomato sauce had no taste). I would not recommend, this restaurant use the fact that it's vegan to sell overpriced sponge with salad on it."
78,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, great tastes! You should try tiramisu...!"
79,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Stumbled upon this place on our Friday night in Amsterdam because it was close to our Airbnb and let me tell you, it was the BEST FIND! Not everyone in my group is vegan and they were in love with the choices and taste and overall flavour. ‚Ä¶"
80,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I had the Red Velvet pizza (avocado, beetroot and walnuts with homemade vegan cheese) and it was simply to die for! The base was so freshly made, it was still amazing when I ate the last slice, which was cold by that time. ‚Ä¶"
81,Mastino, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I've eaten here twice. The first time when it was just open, my pizza was tough as a cracker and half of it was indigestible. The second time I went the base was limp and pale and it tasted of pancake. Possibly the worst gluten-free experience I've ever had."
82,Mastino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pizza was okay (crust a bit burned), I would have liked more traditional ingredients. Service wasn't great, had to call the waiter several times and he seemed in a rush even though the place wasn't super full. I would go back because I can't go to regular Italian restaurants, but the frozen GF pizza we get at the store is better."
83,Mastino, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The only Glutenfree + Plantbased pizzeria in town ! For the pizza experience an amazing treat for celiacs! Different styles of pizza's. It's only a bit pricey for a pizza place... I would love it if the Pizza lover's day (2 pizza's for 30,- ) will come back!"
84,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing!! The best gluten free dough we've tasted (and we tried a lot since we live in London :) ), and the vegan toppings are equally as good! Super friendly service as well. 100% recommended."
85,Mastino, 3 stars ,a year ago,"the pizzas were cold, the crust was chewy, the lot was super oily and there were almost no toppings. way too expensive for pizza's like this. we were pretty sad, because we were looking forward to trying them"
86,Mastino, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"15‚Ç¨ for a ‚Äúvegan‚Äù pizza margherita? Really?
Didn‚Äôt know that flour, water, tomato sauce and mozzarella were that expensive in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
87,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is awesome. Found it randomly and was exactly what I was looking for; gluten free vegan pizza done well. The staff are friendly and the service overall was good. A good selection of soft drinks too (more than I intially realised).
88,Mastino, 1 star ,2 years ago,Did not like the consistency or the taste. Went in with high expectations and was really let Down. I have made vegan pizza at home and to pay premium price and for it to be no way near as good is a let down. Didnt finish both our pizzas.
89,Mastino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We had two very mediocre pizzas and a 4 euro red from gall and gall (yes I priced it) for 60+ euro. Plastic chairs, poor service and an uncoordinated choice in music topped off this 1star review with a üçí on top."
90,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best pizza I've ever had. The cheese is absolutely delicious and the pizza dough is so fluffy. Highly recommend this place.
91,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best Pizza in town when it comes to vegan pizza. The owner is amazing and even after she saw me once, she rememberd me so it always feels like I am visting family :) Try the tiramisu (sugar free and vegan)"
92,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is the best pizza place, and they make vegan pizza's!!! I love it and I will definitely become a regular. If it's not for the pizzas, its for the sweetest staff on earth <3"
93,Mastino, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Ordered the pesto pizza. The pesto really made the pizza worse. It tasted like when I fail making a pesto. But the other pizza which I can't remember was good, not excellent but good. However, I would prefer Domino's vegan pizzas instead."
94,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing! Where else can you get gluten free, vegan pizza that is super delicious???? That‚Äôs right I have no idea. You gotta eat here"
95,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Incredible pizza that is GF and vegan! We went there for dinner each day we were in Amsterdam and were never disappointed. Service and atmosphere were great also. Highly recommend!
96,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best gluten free pizza I ever ate anywhere in the world! With welcoming and friendly host Paolo, it‚Äôs the place to go if you want GF / vegan pizza and treats. You must try the GF tiramisu!"
97,Mastino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly service and welcoming atmosphere.
D√©cor was somewhat spartan and felt more like sitting down in grandma's kitchen rather than having a seat in a restaurant. Whether that's enjoyable or not is a ‚Ä¶"
98,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice idea, very delicious and a nice Food Store also for ""normal"" People. Maybe less oil as topping, but I'll come back. Delicious Pizza topping and a nice dough."
99,Mastino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really good gluten free pizza. I have searched high and low for a good quality GF base in AMS. The place also caters to Vegans also. Note it's vegetarian so no prosciutto on your pizza. They have a sister place I am told that does normal pizzas also.
100,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good list of vegan pizzas to choose from, pleasant atmosphere and most of all staff is very attentive and friendly. Would definitely recommend it."
101,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Must go! Family business with really creative vegan and gluten free options. Coffee, tea, wine, desserts, pizza, cheese, focaccia - they have everything!"
102,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really great place. The woman at the counter was lovely and a great communicator. The food was far beyond expectation, although I should mention that the portion sizes are a bit small. Not that that is a bad thing. Overall, I had a superb experiences and look forward to returning"
103,Mastino, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The pizzas might be vegan, but the taste is not great. No interesting flavors/spices, all very bland. Also too expensive. Nice staff though."
104,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a fantastic Gluten and Dairy free Pizza here in early January. Suggest you book in advance, they even have gluten free beer and the staff are great."
105,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The vegan pizza was delicious. The average price for a pizza is 15-18 euros but it is very much worth it. This is some of the best vegan pizza I have had.
106,Mastino, 2 stars ,3 years ago,I know it is not easy to get a good crust with gluten free dough but this was disappointing. A ton of toppings doesn't help when you can't even get the pizza off the plate. Should mention the extremely slow service as well.
107,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best pizza ever, even when compared with gluten pizza! Fresh and delicious ingredients, with just the right balance of quantities."
108,Mastino, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Vegan and gluten free very very good pizas. If you eat gluten free this is the place to go for a lovely pizza. The owner is super friendly ‚Ä¶
109,Mastino, 2 stars ,a year ago,We ordered the pizza #13 which is supposed to come with vegan cheese vegan mozzarella and vegan Parmesan.. there was so little cheese on it but so much rucola for 17‚Ç¨!!
110,Mastino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really tasty vegan pizza, could use a bit more ambiance. But the owner/service is really nice and makes you feel right at home."
111,Mastino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good experience. We asked for a vegan pizza - Margherita - and a caprese. To be completely honest, the pizza was not the best but the caprese was delicious."
112,Mastino, 1 star ,3 years ago,good pizza but the price is sick. if you want to change a ingredients of a pizza you must pay more!.. and the waitor didnt say that. thats rip of! bad service! .. ‚Ä¶
113,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Such a fabulous vegan dining experience, the pizzas were to die for and there was so much choice. The staff were very welcoming too."
114,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing vegan pizza!!!!! Wowowow I had the 4 ‚Äúcheese‚Äù and it was delicious, only negative thing was the sloooow delivery from Deliveroo, but Mastino was unreal."
115,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was very surprised. The pizzas were delicious! The staff was nice too. A very good overall experience, totally recommend"
116,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place; the only place in Amsterdam I trust as a celiac. Nothing in the whole restaurant contains gluten. Pizzas are great, and so are the deserts."
117,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic gluten free crust and they have regular mozzarella cheese in addition to vegan.  Highly recommended for all!
118,Mastino, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service wasn't great, made to pay card as more convenient for them. Pizza was dry, had two different flavours and not a lot of taste to either."
119,Mastino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I think it's the best pizza I've ever had.
It's a bit too pricy, and serving it on a carton box isn't earth friendly, but the pizza is soooo delicious I would buy it again."
120,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,My friend and I really enjoyed our visit! Staff was super friendly and food very tasty. Loved the beer as well. Looking forward to next time. üòä
121,Mastino, 1 star ,2 years ago,We got sent away because the personell made a mistake in their agenda. We had to rush to finish our desert because of their mistake and they were being very ignorant about it. The food was ok but this is unacceptable in a professional restaurant.
122,Mastino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Pricey but great quality gluten free pizza.

Disclaimer: they only serve pizza, no pasta. Pizzas cost around 18‚Ç¨ but are worth it."
123,Mastino, 5 stars ,a year ago,Super good pizza. One of the best gluten free pizzas I have ever eaten!
124,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great pizza and lovely service! One of the best pizzas I had even it's gluten free and vegan.
125,Mastino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Graat tasty food with a bit of an healthy touch. Great service from a friendly, Italian crew, occasionally nice events sometimes with live jazz on Thursday nights."
126,Mastino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious vegan and gluten-free pizza! The base was so light and fluffy and the pizzas were amazing.
127,Mastino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food. Nice staff. They were fully booked but suggested that we sat in the bar until a table was free. Took 5 minutes! A bit out of the city but it's worth it
