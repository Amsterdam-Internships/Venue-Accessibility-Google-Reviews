0,Freddy Fryday, 4 stars ,a week ago,Tasty loaded fries which can give you a heart already while entering the store. It‚Äôs the perfect experience after a night out with an enormous hangover. The banana milkshake is also to recommend. The pulled chicken was second to none. A bit spicy as well. Tip top.
1,Freddy Fryday, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Cozy place with a delicious dish called Funky Freddy Fries, it‚Äôs homemade fries with toppings. Ordered a big pulled pork, portions are generous and really well served. Prices are good, will definitely come back again and try different funky fries."
2,Freddy Fryday, 2 stars ,a month ago,The fries was not fresh at all they seemed to fry it several times. It was the most tasteless fries I got in Amsterdam. Rlly disappointed cuz the pics look so nice
3,Freddy Fryday, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I had the pulled pork fries normal size (bigger). It was very nice, no regrets! The fries as base were freshly fried and not very oily.
