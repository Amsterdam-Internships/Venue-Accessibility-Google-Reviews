13,Caf√© Kooper, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The bar is very nice for a weekend drink and to taste the ""Leidseplein"" atmosphere as its terras is directly on the square. Staff was very kind and energetic. Tourist prices but that goes for every place in the area so not a problem at all. ‚Ä¶"

24,Caf√© Kooper, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We had the idea to have a quick breakfast here, so we ordered fried eggs with cheese and coffee. The coffee arrived quickly within 10 minutes, but not together with the fried eggs. It took 45 minutes for the breakfast to arrive! Way too long! Also the waitress was quite unfriendly and not customer oriented."
25,Caf√© Kooper, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Came across this place recently, loved the vibes and especially the new renovations done, great environment and such friendly staff, would definitely recommend."
26,Caf√© Kooper, 1 star ,3 years ago,If I could give to this bar -5 stars I would. The prices are twice as much as what is written in the menu. The drinks are only juice without alcohol. As for that we had to pay +3 euros for the juice and it was nowhere referred. Very rude waitress. The rable was dirty and we asked for it to be cleaned 5 times. Just don t come here.

34,Caf√© Kooper, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Went in this bar with a couple friends and we have been served diluted alcohols... Come on, customers are not fools.

42,Caf√© Kooper, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Not only terible toilets, but they charge 50 cents for it as well. Drinks were decent to be honest"
