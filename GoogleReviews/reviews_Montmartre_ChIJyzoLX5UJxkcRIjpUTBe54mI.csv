0,Montmartre, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fun, Festive, Friendly bar (that is frequented by local Dutchies).  Happy hour is from 6-8 everyday 7 days a week. There is no food here FYI."
1,Montmartre, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The decoration and music are purposely kitschy. The place can be very fun and people (customers and staff) are very friendly. Has usually an older crowd. Cocktails are great and the happy hour (every day from 18h to 20h) make the prices very attractive.
