0,Lux, 1 star ,8 months ago,"The short man at the bar is rude and incompetent. They had a cocktail menu but yet he was somehow insulted when my friend asked if she could have a margarita, which wasn’t on the menu. He was incredibly rude so we cancelled our order and left. There are many places within 2 mins walk of here that offer better service."

8,Lux, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very hipster bar with crowds of people. This place just has an atmosphere that I admire, it feels comfortable to chill and drink here even though there are always so many people, but I could do with less people. Cafe Lux is one of my go to bars in Amsterdam with friends."
9,Lux, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Good selection of beers. Nice gin tonics cocktails. The atmosphere is very nice. There's a floor downstairs and two places to order the drinks. Definitely recommend it!
