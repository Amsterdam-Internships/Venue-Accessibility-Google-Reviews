0,Maoz, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Was closed last week 26th Jan '22.
Service is very ""Soup guy"" from Seinfeld. However, the falafel is good, its quick and fresh and salad bar and sauces are good enough. Dont buy drinks or fries, you are here for falafel."
1,Maoz, 1 star ,2 months ago,"This place changed. Used to be great, now the staff is aggressive and hostile towards customers. Food quality and hygiene has gone way down. Never had this bad of an experience before."
2,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fresh falafel bullets , hot and unlimited salads (fillings) and hummus. Make your own falafel style place. 100% vegan. Vegan mayonnaise and garlic sauces. Fresh salads. The staff is very warm and friendly and you’ll love the delicious falafel. Totally worth the money. You can choose the size of the falafel too."
3,Maoz, 5 stars ,11 months ago,I’ve never had real shoarma so I can’t compare it to that but this vegan shoarma is really great! Also love that they have eco friendly forks
4,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place does a mean falafel pita and I love the diy salad bar schtick. The fries were adequately salted and the vegan mayo delicious. Five stars.
5,Maoz, 1 star ,4 months ago,Worst customer service ever! The staff was rude and ignored while I was talking to them and asking questions about my order. They worked unhygienic and were very unfriendly. Wouldn’t recommend coming here again. Going to another location instead.
6,Maoz, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Worst service I’ve ever received in my life. They don’t know how to treat a customer, really rude people and they clearly have hygiene issues, touching everything without gloves"
7,Maoz, 1 star ,a month ago,"I'm still sick now, 7 hours after ""intoxicating"" myself with a falafel salad and fries. Clearly this place has severe hygiene issues. 🤢"
8,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice burger(I couldn’t remember the name), delicious vegetables and sauces. The fried balls were also great. Do visit if you want to have a pure vegan food."
9,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best falafels in town! Full of vegan options! Try it out!
10,Maoz, 2 stars ,7 months ago,i’m extremely disappointed with this restaurant. I am a huge fan of maoz but i’ve been to this location multiple times and all those times it has been a disgusting experience. the guy that served us has been the same all these times and …
11,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First stop in your trip to Amsterdam has to be Maoz! I ordered the #2 falafel, fries, and a drink. The falafel was one of the best falafels I've had, fries were nice and hot; definitely a must stop place."
12,Maoz, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Unfortunately the attitude is really unpleasant. I entered the shop with a smile with good vibe because I am vegan and my first time in Amsterdam, but too sad the guy was dealing with me in a bad way. despite the food good or not the …"
13,Maoz, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Used to come sometimes, but since my last visit I will never come again. I cannot trust this place anymore. I literally saw someone take a spoon from the salad bar, put it in their mouth, and replace it. All while the staff was just …"
14,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You can choose to get falafel or shawarma (I got a mushroom shawarma) and then add other ingredients and sauces you want. Was very tasty, would come back here again"
15,Maoz, 3 stars ,2 months ago,"Good for vegans, but for an omnivore not really recommended."
16,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best place for us the vegan and Israelis guys! Great falafel with a good vibe, but there is no place to sit."
17,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good and fresh late night feed. The place is clean, service is efficient and friendly, most importantly the falafel was tasty, as were the condiments that you could add to it. Would appreciate a better selection of beverages as well some more outdoor seating. A very pleasant experience."
18,Maoz, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Fresh falafel and salads. Love the Tahini and their spicy sauce

The pittas sometime taste like they were frozen …"
19,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent vegetarian experience. For €10 you will be full! Freshly cooked and very tasty
20,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great. Vegeterian options. Select your filling with the falafel and pita bread.
21,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The two times that I have visited this shop for lunch I was not disappointed. Their falafel sandwiches are the best I have ever tried, and there are lots of appropriate condiments to season the sandwiches to your liking. This spot is one of …"
22,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"In a category of the fast takeaway places this one is really nice. The falafels are fresh, delicious and all toppings are super tasty. …"
23,Maoz, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Poor service, not friendly staff. Let you wait for nothing and give you a cold falaffel!"
24,Maoz, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Falafel was very fried, very tasteless, buns (pita) are super small, regardless of medium or small. Expensive price, one of the pros is that you can refill your pita, but as small as it is it's not like you have much room to comfortably eat it without making a mess."
25,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Wouldn't recommend. The service made us feel really uncomfortable, treating us like he hated us from the point we walked in. The portions are super small and their system is very inconvenient (they make you fill the falafel yourself). One …"
26,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you want fresh food like cucumber, tomato, various, olives, pickles,  with falafal + pita bread and a variety of spicy sauces, this is the ideal place for you. We had it on two consecutive days for lunch and still could go for it again. …"
27,Maoz, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"The best falafels in the world, but the man that worked there that evening, was incredibly and unnecessarily rude."
28,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Nothing against Maoz as a company, I like the food here, posting this especially for this outlet. I visited today night with my brother and felt quiet unwelcomed by the Staff in service.  Extremely rude, charged me 2 Euros extra for regular …"
29,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best falafel in the city hands down. Always fresh. Priced right. The pita bread is authentic middle east. Not the thin wraps other falafel joints pass out as a true falafel. Better than hitting all the fast food franchises in the area. Give it a try.
30,Maoz, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The best part about the meal was the fries for sure, the problem is you get about 8 of them to a portion. Falafel was good, but nothing to write home about. Place was pretty disorganised and the staff were really inattentive"
31,Maoz, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food is great but they bl**dy ripped us off. And I suspect they do this more often on busy nights. Super busy on Saturday eve, very crowded and almost no time to order and collect your food. Then the guy charges us €17 for 1 x large …"
32,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food at Maoz is incredible, fresh and excellent value for money. The salad buffet and sauces are self serve so you can customise your fresh falafel with delicious salads. I highly recommend for vegans and vegetarians!"
33,Maoz, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The food is really nice, but the service was a disaster. The staff was very impolite: when I asked him, what kind of sauces they have, he answered 'everything'. At the end he even gave me the wrong sandwich. Very bad experience."
34,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My first vegan experience in Amsterdam...Got the falafel and wasn’t disappointed ✅🌱
35,Maoz, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"For 5 euros you get a pita bread with falafel and unlimited salad. The salad is from a salad bar and is very fresh, tasty and high quality. There are no real tables, only some stools, so I usually have to stand here since it is often …"
36,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Desorganized and overprized. They forgot the drinks in my order and the ""regular"" Fries obviously means 14 (yes, I did in fact count them). That is a solid 20 Cents per frie, so you better enjoy every single one of them!"
37,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Service was great, and price was great! They offered chips, falafel pitta bread (which you chose your salad fillings and did yourself) drinks and fresh orange or lemon juice. For a decent lunch/meal which at this time came to €9.80 it was just what I wanted!"
38,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious and healthy falafel pitas. There is also wholewheat, big, small and amazing fries too. Everything is fresh. Check out the green sauce on the left, full of herbs.
Great healthy fast food!"
39,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food. They have a salad counter where you can continue topping up your Pita, as you eat. Good selection of sauces, pickles, vegetable and chilli's. Central location and large chain in Amsterdam city. Can be spotted often. I went to the Dam square outlet."
40,Maoz, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice little falafel place. Once you get your sandwich you can try all their difference sauces that are left on the counter. Some people would put a little sauce, go take a bit, put a little more and so on. The one down side is that they do …"
41,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"BEST. HANGOVER. CURE. EVER! Also, the falafels are to die for! You can pile on as many extras as you can fit onto your wrap, and scarf it down the beautiful streets outside of Amsterdam. We were in heaven eat these, and miss them every day ..."
42,Maoz, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst hummus I ever had. Took pita with hummus and falafel for 5.5 euro. Falafel is very fresh, but hummus is terrible with horrible bitter taste like it was too old. Falafel is not bad but far from the good one. Even vegetables and different sauces can't help me to finish. Wasting of money."
43,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and reasonable staff.
The other night I was ordering some food. I paid and as the worker handed over the meal I fumbled it like a Baffoon. My friend cault part of the meal. The …"
44,Maoz, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This is one of the worst place I have ever eat something so far. Very disrespectful cashier, unhealthy food, unnecessary expensive, the falafel was almost empty and fries were not tasty. No drama queen here, but if you want to be insulted with your money, go for it"
45,Maoz, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Unacceptable, unbelievable.
We are in Amsterdam, city where everyone Is supposed to be as desired without being scared of judgment or prejudices. Today I was with a friend (female) who …"
46,Maoz, 2 stars ,a year ago,It was extremely disturbing to see the cashier picking things off the salad bar and eat it 😲😷
47,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Yummy unlimited salads (until you finish your pita) falafel could be better. Yummy just not quite the texture it used to be.
48,Maoz, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I would never expected to have such a good falafel from a chain restaurant.

Amazing, tasty and fresh. …"
49,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The falafel pita 🥙 was good. Served hot bread with hot falafel and you can put whatever vegetables, sauces, pickles in whatever quantities you want. Basically the guy will warm a pita bread for you and put falafel in it, rest you make your own. Quite reasonable as well. Just €5"
50,Maoz, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very good vegetarian fast food. They only serve falafels and belgian fries but one doesn't really need anything else in fast food :) Falafels and fries are very good and they have a good selection of sauces and condiments that you stuff yourself into your falafel.
51,Maoz, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to get a falafal. Nothing fancy here, there is room to sit and the food is not expensive. …"
52,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is, in my humble opinion, the best falafel place in Amsterdam. Clean, super sauces, fine saladbar and crispy falafel.
Friendly staff. A very high quality cheap meal!"
53,Maoz, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Delicious Falafel. However, it is very crowded and no concept concerning the salad bar. I put some of the green sauce on my falafel without knowing that it was hot as hell. Some labels would be nice."
54,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is the place to get amazing food with friendly service !!
55,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ate here due to convenient location, google reviews and great value for money, and was not disappointed at all!
Delicious felafels with unlimited salad bar!
Would definitely recommend"
56,Maoz, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We we’re there almost 2 hours before closing time, but open isn’t necessarily open.
This alone would simply have been disappointing, however the guy inside was …"
57,Maoz, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Quite delicious! Great falafel and salad items! I love their frites with curry and their spicy green sauce. Go on an off time, though. This place is quite small!"
58,Maoz, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great falafel, sauces and veggies. Careful if you wanna pick vegan shawarma, it's ok but it's actually fried mushrooms, which isn't advertised anywhere."
59,Maoz, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Tasty falafel sandwiches.
60,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome place with excellent vegetarian option of pita bread falafel and salad box. You have the option to refill the pita bread with numerous toppings and sauces available.
Must visit."
61,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What more is there to say apart from Falafel filled pittas with so many options for toppings …
62,Maoz, 1 star ,5 years ago,I have been to a close by maoz a few times which was very good. This one the guy gave me my salad in a paper wrap and when I asked for the salad box which was plastic and behind him he gave me a snaller tray meant for chips. I had to point …
63,Maoz, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Restaurant probably managed by very badly behaving staff ( or waiters ). Looks to be Indians or Hindi speaking Asiaians . Very bad behaving, arrogant staff - all 3 of them. Unprovoked probably racist tinge to their behaviour. Indians …"
64,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,In Amsterdam? Go here to fill your stomach for only 5€ and you ll love it ! Must visit when on a trip here! Unlimited toppings ! As much as you like! A perfect nice falafel
65,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best falafel I have ever eaten! I’m visiting them often and the quality is always the same:) + very friendly staff
66,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Decent falafel with a big choice of veggies. The place is fully vegan and also changed it’s name into Maoz Vegan.
67,Maoz, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"No other vegetarian choice nearby. French fries served here is of high oil content. For vegetarians, Better to take your own quick bites while you walk around amsterdam central"
68,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best day food franchises in Amsterdam. The concept is unique: eat all you can as long as you still have bread to fill it in. Good prices.
69,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Moaz has the best falafel in Amsterdam, but this particular shop is pretty small and crowded. Cool that everything is vegan though!"
70,Maoz, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Lovely food.  Disappointing service.  I know I don't speak the native tongue, but I have also not been there before so don't understand the way it works.  So please just be a little more patient with your customers that are new and potentially will eat there again."
71,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The broodje is literally just a container for the all you can eat veggies. Great option if you are hungry af but want to convince yourself of eating healthy
72,Maoz, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Terrible service, employees have 0 patience. It had decent food. Do not order your food during rush hour or you won't get the chance to put any topping in your food."
73,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food with the refill option which is basically what you need. Price is perfect for what you get, and everything is vegetarian (I eat meat, but I did not feel the need there, it is all so tasteful!)."
74,Maoz, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I was ordering a pita , and a pickpocketer stole my phone at that moment. it was heartbreaking as I lost all of my memories in photos I had on the phone. As soon as i realised my phone is missing I looked around &  I chased the suspect, …"
75,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Good service with friendly staff
76,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"you have to love this light and vegetarian restaurant , it has only falafel medium or large and fries, you got to choose whatever you wont for salad and add it yourself with sauces it is so delicious but the seating area is not convenient and not recommended"
77,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place with tasty falafel. Prices are ok as for the centre of Amsterdam (6 eur for normal falafel with refill).
78,Maoz, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very delicious, the price is totally okay, you can fill your own pita however you like and they have vegan sauces too"
79,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is fantastic!

Vegan food at the right price. Staff are pretty friendly and food is tasty, …"
80,Maoz, 1 star ,3 years ago,"They say they’re vegan, yet are the only place in Amsterdam that won’t allow a small dog inside, which is a funny conflict of interest. The manager gave me the middle finger lol"
81,Maoz, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty good food for a reasonable price. But the staff could have been more friendly.
82,Maoz, 5 stars ,a year ago,maoz vegan Falafel in Amsterdam  very testy. I love. Falafel Zak Muntplein de best vegan food...

84,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My first falafel kabob. I love it. Super healthy. Super delicious. Cheap. Great service
85,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Falafel is good, they have a toppings bar, very small place so grab your food and go because it can get very crowded in there fast."
86,Maoz, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Running out of shoarma and small options is one thing, not accepting Visa credit cards is another! A business that doesn't put the customer first shouldn't be supported... Very disappointed."
87,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Small place but great food at great prices!  Would not hesitate to go again.
88,Maoz, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good falafel but the menu is a bit pricy. Says homemade fries but they are not though....
89,Maoz, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The falafel was good and the fact that you could fill up your plate with as much food as you wanted was even better.
90,Maoz, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Yummy falafel! Not too expensive, with many veggies :) Very little space to sit though, so count on take-out."
91,Maoz, 4 stars ,a year ago,I bought fries one night. The service was really nice and the fries were good and fresh.
92,Maoz, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"All vegan food place, always super crowded and not so clean. But good value for money."
93,Maoz, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It was €9,80 for a normal meal at Maoz Vegetarian, which included a falafel, chips and a drink of choosing. The meal was filling and tasty, and is cheap for what you get, especially in a city as expensive as Amsterdam."
94,Maoz, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Good options for vegetarian. I can tell because I am a vegetarian. Spicy sauces available. But the food products are not as healthy as they claim they are.
95,Maoz, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious and healthy falafel sandwiches for super low prices. 1 star less for not so friendly service
96,Maoz, 5 stars ,5 years ago,It's hard to believe this is a franchise. The food is so fresh and delicious. A great way to get some vegetables in you for very little money.
97,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great pita bread. great option for veg. and vegan. the guy on counter is also nice.
98,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best falafel ever and the toppings are amazing as well. 10/10 would eat here again.

103,Maoz, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great falafel place right in the center of Amsterdam! Friendly service, quality fillings!! You will want to be back."
104,Maoz, 1 star ,6 years ago,The food is good! But the staff are the most racist people you'll ever meet in your entire life.
105,Maoz, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is tasty, but only few people can sit inside and the staff isn't very nice."
106,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty great but not as good as the one at Damrak in terms of both friendly staff, good seating and good quality."
107,Maoz, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Fresh falafel, you can pick your own vegetables. Be careful with the green sauce, it's hot!"

117,Maoz, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Awesome food but it gets too crowded. Take advantage of the unlimited salad bar!
118,Maoz, 1 star ,3 years ago,The whole wheat pita with falafel and hummus had neither whole wheat nor hummus. Might want to mention that when taking an order.

120,Maoz, 4 stars ,5 years ago,High quality cheap falafel with unlimited salad bar. A great value!

124,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was good, small fry portions, kinda messy eating"
125,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,Pathetic staff which manages the place. Should be given basic etiquette training and food is below par.
126,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice falafels here at decent prizes. Stuffed my falafel with all kinds of things and it was yummy
127,Maoz, 2 stars ,2 years ago,A salad box for 5 euro is 3 falafel and 2 leaves of iceberg...Ridiculous!
128,Maoz, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice food, and I understood their attitude and service is not their strong point, they do not respect the diners and customers as it comes to the customer and diner, it is better to skip this place if the attitude is something you care about, if you do not care about the attitude you get they have very nice food."
129,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The place to go for a cheap eat in amsterdam. A veggie dream, falafel and all you can eat toppings."
