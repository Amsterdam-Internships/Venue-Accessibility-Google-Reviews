0,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"This place is so pretty I just can not even describe it!ü§ç
We actually gave it a try because it looked so good from the outside but the food and the drinks were a hit as well!‚ú® (Try their truffle fries and homemade ‚Ä¶"
1,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Very nice and beautiful place. Chilled and friendly stuff and owner! Thank you for hospitality and best boozy milkshake in Amsterdam! üòúüëç
2,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great ambience! Loved this spot. Would go there again. The ambience for their shop on lower level is so pretty! Bathrooms are clean and they serve great coffee!
3,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Service is decent. A bottle of water is ‚Ç¨7 which is completely ridiculous. Need I say more in an area with many other more affordable alternatives. Not worth it. Food was good though.
4,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Personal unfriendly, we had to wait long time for ordering and after 11pm there are no hot drinks like hot chocolate, coffee or tea which I quite expect when I go to coffeeshop. Unfortunately the only thing what we really got there was a bad mood."
5,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,a month ago,Stunning interior! Definitely worth a visit. Lovely food and cocktails too. Nice staff
6,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This place is great. The food was excellent, the staff was friendly. House made hybiscus tea was wonderful. It is also smoke friendly, but I did not go to the coffeeshop."
7,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Its no longer la grotte. Still same atmosphere, just wish the pancakes were the same. Love this place though. Milkshakes are amaaazing."
8,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food takes a while which really gives it the 2 star loss. However milkshakes are amazing. We ended up buying 6 more!
9,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place ambiance feels great and best for any morning breakfast. Stuff are friendly and always greet you with smile. I really liked the place even to sit there. Food was great too.
10,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"2nd year coming here and can't say enough good things about this place.

13,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We got here, put our orders in , took a seat ,got our weed out and  skinned up , drinks arrived as we were skinning up ....

21,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Everyone here was super friendly. The woman behind the bar asked me to take my hat off for security reasons but she asked me in such a nice way you could tell she was an angel. Great place to go smoke some bud. Although from what I remember ‚Ä¶
22,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice place to eat breakfast/lunch and at a very good price compared to a lot of the tourist traps. Only complaint would be the food does take a while to get to the table. Definitely buy one of their amazing milkshakes though.
23,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Used this place as our 'local' for a short break. Good breakfasts with nice coffee. Also a really relaxed place in the evenings with a nice selection of chilled music. Highly  recommended for the more relaxed Amsterdam traveller....
24,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved it, very clean and food well"
25,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Let's put it this way. We went with my partner for 10 days in Amsterdam and during this period of time we visited La Grote at least 5 times. The stuff are very friendly and really cool. The prices are alright. We had a blast there.

29,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 1 star ,3 years ago,Really poor quality of staff. Everybody in the place got kicked out yesterday for no reason. The staff tried to charge everybody too. The staff was fighting with the owners. If you want a good quality smoke the dampkring and barnys are on ‚Ä¶

34,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Racist establishment! I used to love this place, but the way I was treated last time Mar 2017, was horrifying. They advertise that they are open until 1am, but don't dare step in after midnight. They will hurl insults at you, and criticize ‚Ä¶"
35,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"CASH ONLY!! Not that you know that until after you've ordered and eaten. Who the heck uses cash anymore with contactless, Apple pay, Google pay, credit cards, etc.?   Food is mediocre and it might as well be self service."
36,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great wee place with a nice relaxed vibe. Probably the best pint of Heineken I had in Amsterdam on my visit. Ice cold with a lovely head.
37,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 1 star ,2 years ago,I got ripped off when I was a little bit disoriented at the counter. This doesn't mean it is all around bad and the staff is all dishonest but I just felt that my bad experience ought to be documented here. üòû‚úå
38,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place to drink some beer or coffee. It is also possible to smoke inside (but not tobacco) and they support with free mixing herbs. You must bring the rest.
39,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 3 stars ,3 years ago,It's a nice place to sit with a lovely atmosphere. We didn't try the food as after recieving a warm milkshake we didn't fancy it!
40,Coffeeshop La Grotte, 1 star ,2 years ago,My friend and I got ripped off when I was a little bit disoriented at the counter. This doesn't mean it is all around bad and the staff is all dishonest but I just felt that my bad experience ought to be documented here. üòû‚úå
