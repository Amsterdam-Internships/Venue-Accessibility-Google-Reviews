6,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,The food is really tasty and it's prepared fast. The only downside is that the place is small and really crowded usually
7,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best asian food in Amstedam...hot sauce the best...i like rice noodle also fried rice.. recommended for a quick bite and cheaper.

8,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cheap and delicious street food, what more can you ask for? You get to pick the ingredients and for around 10‚Ç¨, they cook it for you instantly. Eating in the restaurant is also an option. If you're in a hurry and like asian food, you should go for it. You can also find it in many different locations, which is always a plus!"

14,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,7 months ago,This place is incredible! I‚Äôve had it multiple times over my short stay in Amsterdam (I always seem to run into one while I‚Äôm hungry and other stores seem closed) and will dearly miss it while I‚Äôm gone. Great food and quick service!

21,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very congested place, not enough seating place, queue should be more organized. Price is reasonable, depends upon how many extra toppings, can of drink is ‚Ç¨1.95 üòé. Food is tasty, portions are big and location is great."
22,Wok to Walk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I love wok to walk,  but this specific place was terrible. The meat was not cooked at all, and the vegetables also. And the place looks dirty."

34,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,a year ago,"If you know about Asian food naturally you will add many toppings but that quickly adds up here. The knowledge of sauces and  how it's cooked is the authentic Asian way. I have eaten in over 20 Asian countries and I was not disappointed. I had, however, hoped to keep the bill below 10 euro"
35,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super yummy and easy grab and go! üçú

40,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good food in the city center.
41,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's was good, but not excellent. In my opinion, it's too expensive for what it offers. Portions are huge, you can't choose the size. The place is small and crowded, eating inside is impossible. ‚Ä¶"
42,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious food. Great name. We need some franchises in the U.S. I‚Äôve been to Amsterdam twice, ate at Wok to Walk both times, came away pleased both times."
43,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,6 months ago,VERY GOOD. Freshly cooked to order. Great flavor.

51,Wok to Walk, 1 star ,a year ago,"I personally don't like this place and the way they prepare I don't feel it is clean,even they are not serving the quantity u ordered they fill the box as per your requirements or whatever you says but while making they don't put all the ‚Ä¶"
52,Wok to Walk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Expect a crowd but the food is just really passable. It is a neat idea to allow patrons to choose their base of noodles and then ingredients and sauce. However, the end product is nothing to rave about for an Asian palate."
53,Wok to Walk, 3 stars ,a year ago,walk across  the city centre and you will find wok to walk in every 500 mtr. A on the go place for noodles. The taste was ok. But if you are hungry midnight and want a cheap food.. go there :)
54,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome place, why more satiating than it looks!"
55,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is fresh and tasty and most of all... fast. Wok to walk is always spot on with a speedy, decent meal even in their peak times. If you have not been before, don't take my word for it, try it! They are all over Amsterdam and one in London too."
56,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Offers a good selection of noodles and rice. Toppings and sauces are great delicious. ‚Ä¶
57,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Minimalist hole-in-the-wall fast-food Asian noodle chain. Very good, quickly served, food freshly prepared in front of you. Can eat on site in small dining space or take with you in paper boxes as name implies. Excellent choice for fast meal in center of Amsterdam."
58,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It‚Äôs a small intimate space. Good variety of noodles, sauces and ingredients. I loved the total customization so that I could eat what I really wanted to taste. This was the perfect place to grab a bite as I was running from one museum to another."
59,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The ultimate fast food! Fresh, good verity to pick from, super tasty."
60,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to pick or order your own custom wok. Service was very quick, and the ingredients were great quality and very generous.

61,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,a year ago,For a less than 10 euro you can fill your belly ü§™ Taste very good . If you like a lot of people around and feel some Amsterdam spirit go ahead.
62,Wok to Walk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It's OK but I won't be going back, and to be truthful, its pretty expensive for what it is. I've certainly eaten better stir frys in my time. The Chinese part of town is the place go go if you appreciate proper Asian food"
63,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very tasty and comforting wok experience with plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. Small and basic sitting area but very quick so perfect if you're on the go. Very recommended for Asian food lovers!!!
64,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A not so hidden treasure. Make sure you get the right ingredients you want because lines are long but fast. Coming back if I return to Amsterdam. Food is excellent. Udon with pork was amazing.
65,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,It is a great restaurant with different dishes. Also you can choose your favirote combination that matches what you like. Within less than 5 minutes you will receive a delicious order. Price is moderate and depends on added ingredients
66,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I think this is where I ate best woks in my entire life. You have a lot of choices to make your own wok. They miss the 5 stars only because they miss place and more comfortable seats.
Great service, excellent employees."
67,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Cheap, quick and easy. Good food."
68,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best Asian food we had in Amsterdam. Especially the combo of rice, chicken and veggies in Teriyaki sauce. We ate at other wok restaurants as well but didn't like them as much. Only ""Wok to walk"" won our hearts as they served it very fresh, ‚Ä¶"
69,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Always delicious. Can be as cheap or as expensive as you want it to be. No complaints, if you have a desire to eat and burn it off at the same time, this is your jam!!! You can also eat it though"
70,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"If you are a fan of noodles, and starving, this place is highly recommended! You choose first the type of noodles, then the type of meat, then you can add vegetables and/or other type of ingredients such as eggs, peanuts, fried onions and ‚Ä¶"
71,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great food and service for a decent price
72,Wok to Walk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Just like any other Wok to Walk out there, except seemingly with a decent amount of seating. Quick order and as we were eating in, they gave us actual plates instead of the normal cardboard boxes! Benches were functional if not comfortable. ‚Ä¶"
73,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Limited but tasty menu. Finger licking good.
74,Wok to Walk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Don't order the shrimps, garlic and black peper sauce didn't have much taste. Spicy sauce is very good and the concept is very nice. Price/quality is a bit off."
75,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent food created by professional kitchen staff, being able to see your food be cooked right in front of you is awesome. Just a bit on the expensive side for a supposed takeaway with a standard meal being around 9-10‚Ç¨"
76,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing good food. The spicy range is from beginner level to expert level which I loved about the food. Good ambience and good staff. Try egg noodles with garlic oil.
77,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to have a midnight bite all tossed veggies with choices of sauces and made in front of your eyes.
Prompt service and quick moves by the chefs there .
Would be gr8 if beer too was served at least draught beer."
78,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Wok to Walk is the best ‚Äúfast food‚Äù you can ask for! They have good options to create your own plate as you want. And the best of all, quite cheap! A really good option from the traditional fast foods you find everywhere!  Don‚Äôt worry to wait in line‚Ä¶ It moves quite fast!"
79,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice Asian fast food in Amsterdam. A lot of wok combinations, with many vegetarian options. A perfect place for a quick lunch. Friendly staff and prices ok."
80,Wok to Walk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very very small restaurant to take quick bite of wok, which is prepared in the open kitchen in front of the customers. Food quality is bot so good and prices are also very high and food is not looking healthy at the first sight, should only ‚Ä¶"
81,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,cant beat the price for the quality of the meal. most food around is really expensive. and this really provides a good meal at a affordable price. also the hours are great for getting a late meal.
82,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I love this place! I have to say this is always become our highlight meal of the day when we were around Centraal. Simply delicious variety of stir fries!
83,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very quick and tasty food. It's very customizable. One can select noodle/rice/veggies as the base, add toppings and sauces."
84,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"THE nicest take away I have ever eaten, the portion you get for the price is really good. Definitely recommend this place."
85,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Tasty meal in Amsterdam! Concept is simple, basically a 'pick your own stuff' stir fry joint. Pick your noodles (base), pick a filler (meat or shrimp), and then top it off with sauces and other fillers (such as veggies). Massive portions, ‚Ä¶"
86,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing plates and fast service
87,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Without doubt the best asian fast food in Amsterdam if not the whole of Europe. It's a pilgrimage whenever the fellas are in town with work, but after 5 years living in Chiang Mai I know a little about the common stir fry and they don't come much better than this. Highly recommended."
88,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Quick service and delicious food, but the staff are quite rude. You can pick all the ingredients for your dish, which is great."
89,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Life saver when on a three day bender in the dam, a Wok to walk will rejuvenate you and get you back on it."
90,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Its a special spot, almost from a film. Watch how your meal is slowly cooked. Sit to eat at the front window. The heavy Red Light District is just in front of you. Hookers windows are shining in the distance. You, the leading actor, a bit drunk, after stuff over there."
91,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Bit expensive but food tastes great.
92,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Delicious food and cool staff

96,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good taste with reasonable price.
97,Wok to Walk, 1 star ,3 years ago,The actual worst place to eat. Payed 24 euro for 2 meals to take 3 bites each and throw it away. I have never thrown away food in my life before
98,Wok to Walk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It's like subway, you pick whatever ingredients and sauces but with Chinese food, they cook it for you. The noodle and rice are too wet. Missing the ""wok"" taste"
99,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Service was fast and not unfriendly. Great variety and great value. A large selection and large portion for a decent price makes this great if you are a budget traveler on the go.
100,Wok to Walk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worst service ever. Asked them why they were charging ‚Ç¨2.50 for a bottle of water when you can drink tap water & server said you can't drink the tap water. Total BS line for tourists. When I asked to speak to manager, she said go to go to website & contact manager. All the staff had terrible attitudes."
101,Wok to Walk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Bland. Sauce hardly has a taste. Guy goofs up your orders putting the wrong things in. With so many places to eat in the area you should choose something else.
102,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"YUM! Must go for us everytime we visit Dam. Personalised, tasty, fresh and made to order noodles - can't go wrong!"
103,Wok to Walk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The chicken in the counter was brown, which put me off at first.

They aren't cooked long enough for everything to be hot all the way through, ‚Ä¶"
104,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you find yourself short on cash or not wanting to pay the over priced restaurant prices in dam, you can do a lot worse than here. Really tasty!"
105,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You can't really go wrong with Wok to Walk! Super fresh and tasty food that always hits the spot, very much wish there was one in my home town."
106,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best place for decent food if you like stir fry . Mix an match veg toppings meets egg no egg . Vegan option

110,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The same Wok to Walk quality. Althougt this space in question was very small and the line to order is so compressed with people there waiting for their meal or waiting in line..besides that all good.. and this place is from walking distance from red light

114,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Tasty but your meal will leave much plastic waste behind. You can ask for a plate instead of a box...
