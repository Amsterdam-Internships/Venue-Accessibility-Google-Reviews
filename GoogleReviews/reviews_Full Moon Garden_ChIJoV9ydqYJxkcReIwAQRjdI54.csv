0,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Good place to go for dimsum. I usually go to Oriental City but wanted to give this place a try and I was not disappointed. I had been craving the jellyfish duck salad which was great. Side note, I also appreciate the fact that they were checking the QR codes and IDs diligently even though some customers were complaining."
1,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Tasty, authentic, amazing food! Got a recommendation while visiting Amsterdam and the food was so good that I had to go there three times! I highly recommend all the duck dishes! The prices have gone up a lot since last time and seems like ‚Ä¶"
2,Full Moon Garden, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Fantastic chashu ribs. Amazing tripe/ organ stew if you are feeling adventurous. The stir fried flat noodles is the best I‚Äôve had in a long time. Dim sum wise it‚Äôs just ok, you can find better dim sum elsewhere in Amsterdam. I‚Äôll be back to try more dishes!"
3,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Delicious dumplingsü•∞
And everything else we tried was also really good!

My favorite was the wonton soup"

5,Full Moon Garden, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Good dim sum, but charging 6,50 for still water is just too much. We were also ""offered"" tea which in the end cost 2,50. Also, the waiter ""suggested"" leaving a tip, which I don't think would have happened if they didn't think we were ‚Ä¶"

10,Full Moon Garden, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"I love this place. I did take out during covid tons, the kung pao chicken, salt and pepper shrimps are to die for. The Chinese noodles with chicken is bae. And when dinning there I love all the dimsums. The truffle chicken, prawn and pork Nom Nom. Enjoy!!!"
11,Full Moon Garden, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"The ordering system was not explained to us, which made the actual ordering process hectic. Food was brought out so far apart, that some of us were already half finished before others could start eating. ‚Ä¶"
12,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was extremely fast and friendly. Food was amazing and just as I remembered it from their location in The Hague.

14,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Just amazing! We visited a few times and the restaurant was full every time. The food is delicious, service is quick and the staff are friendly. It's fun that you get a sheet to fill out your food choices and then they just bring them out one by one."

19,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Second visit for Dim Sum.  The staff seated us promptly.

We ticked off all our favourite Dim Sum items. ‚Ä¶"
20,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Dimsum was top!! Yang Chow fried rice was amazingly delicious( although a bit too oily for me). Great place to have family dinner. I will definitely come back and recommend this restaurant üëç

22,Full Moon Garden, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Delicious afternoon with a very big and nice menu with lots of options.

We took all the  time we needed, had chinese beer and service was great."
23,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This Dim Sum place has everything thats whats most original in a Cantonese cuisine! Its located near Leidseplein and its open till late! Very delicious taste and textures and definitely dont forget to order the egg tarts because thosd are really divine! You have to be quick they are a hot selling item there!
24,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this place. Originally we always went to the Hauge for to the first restaurant, and this one is just as good. That means that it is the best (after my opinion) DimSum in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
25,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,4 months ago,A lot of differnt foods to much to choose and a lot of vegab options

31,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Ordered the steamed pork and salted fish patty(?) and it was definitely the best I've had in my life (and I've had this dish many times in many countries)! The quality of this dish was faultless and makes me want to go back each time. Other dishes were decent but nothing exceptional (the ones I've tried).
32,Full Moon Garden, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"After reading many reviews about the bad and rude service, I can only confirm that to me they made a lot of effort and gave good service. But, I expected the food quality to be great which unfortunatley was not the case. That really was ‚Ä¶"

35,Full Moon Garden, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The mixed meat is good, the roasted pork flavor is on point the crisp is good and no gamey flavour. The duck didn't look very good but was tasty and the skin was crispy and fat, the char siu was a bit dry but good on flavour. The dim sum in this place is soso"
36,Full Moon Garden, 4 stars ,3 months ago,My go-to Chinese and Dimsum place. The Vietnamese spring roll is the best! Lots of vegetarian option too!
37,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best dim sum in Amsterdam. Highly recommend it. Great fresh dishes with authentic flavours and traditional dishes. Service is also good, better than your average Chinese restaurant all round. I can also recommend the fried noodles too."

After my first try, I have eat many times"
39,Full Moon Garden, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"HK BBQ soy chicken was advertised with paksoi - came with some sorry remains of an onion. Even worse, the chicken was full of big, sharp bones. Won't be ordering here again."

55,Full Moon Garden, 1 star ,a year ago,"I have been a loyal customer at Full Moon Amsterdam and have eaten here more than 25 times. I visit it regularly and know the regular taste of the dishes we order very well. Today, I ordered the three cup chicken, which we had 5 to 6 times ‚Ä¶"

62,Full Moon Garden, 2 stars ,a year ago,"We ordered takeaway. While the portion size was good, the taste was somewhat lacking. The roast pork and roast duck were dry and both were served with a small container of the same light soy sauce. The rice was also dry and not of very high ‚Ä¶"

65,Full Moon Garden, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Food was great, lots of variety and options. We didn't reserve but had a good place to sit. We ordered the dim sum mix and fried dumplings. One was missing but that was okay. Recommend it !"
66,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We ordered the seafood menu (6-8 persons). The quality of the dishes were splendid! The overall experience was great! The staff was very polite and attentive. Have you ever thought of building rooms where people can sing karaoke and eat ‚Ä¶
67,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,That's the best dimsum in Amsterdam which is most close to Cantonese standard!
68,Full Moon Garden, 2 stars ,a year ago,"I used to love the food and ordered it on ubereats a lot. But all of a sudden everything is 2 or 3 Euros more expensive, per dish! That's just ridiculous! I know restaurants are in trouble. But if you want to keep your customers, this is not the way."
69,Full Moon Garden, 1 star ,a year ago,"This time we didn't know we have to reserve a table before we enter the restaurant, which apparently made the server very upset and unfriendly to us: ""NO RESERVATION, NO COME IN"". We understand it is a difficult period of time, and we also ‚Ä¶"

72,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My favorite restaurant I‚Äôve ordered so many times on Uber eats to my house never been there but order once a week the delivery people remember me. Very good Duck, Pork, Dumplings, and Tea. You need to buy this rn."
73,Full Moon Garden, 1 star ,a year ago,"Ordered from here through Ubereats, food was extremely greasy and flavorless. Steamed dumplings seemed old, shrimp inside got hard. We had to throw most of the food away, and it was not cheap at all."
74,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Tasty dimsum. We ‚ù§ the salty egg yolk bun
75,Full Moon Garden, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Though you shouldn't go here expecting great dim sum, it is the best dim sum in Amsterdam. Dishes are tasty and portions are large. Though the plate prices are a bit steep you'll most likely get super full on about 20 euros. They will not serve you tap water even if you're ordering a full meal and other drinks. Service otherwise good."
76,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"On a par with the best dim sum I've had in Europe (been to some fab places in London too), and far superior to anything I've come across in my adopted country, Germany. Dishes on offer are extremely diverse and well-prepared, and for the amount you pay very reasonably priced. Recommended."
77,Full Moon Garden, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It was super nice, we were served green tea on the house. The food was delicious. I can't recommend the dim sum enough. I am definitely really into coming here again. I was not very fond of the duck because it was boney and hard to eat. The service and employees were really nice"
78,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place has wonderful dishes! What really surprised me was they had durian puffs on the menu, I got these and they were delicious! (I love durian). They have all the standard dim sum dishes and they all tastes great, decent pricing and good service. I recommend eating here if you're craving Chinese food."
79,Full Moon Garden, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food but...we were a group with a couple of kids. Everyone ordered food  and drinks. At the end of the meal one of the kids asked for a small glass of tap water because his meal was a bit salty. The server no, he had to order a bottle ‚Ä¶"

81,Full Moon Garden, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice newly opened Full Moon Garden, a Chinese restaurant in Amsterdam. Good price for the portion. Ordered it's crispy pork belly and a couple of other dishes. I was honestly surprised due to the portion. Service is really friendly but can be better, comparable to other good Chinese restaurant in Netherlands."
82,Full Moon Garden, 1 star ,a year ago,"The food is tasty, however, I placed an order via their website (which promotes takeaway & delivery) and it was a completely disorganized process. ‚Ä¶"
83,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Some of the best dim sum I've had outside of Asia. MAKE A RESERVATION! And when you do, get the name of the person who takes it. They lost our phone reservation, but were able to seat us anyway. Good service all around."
84,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is definitely one of my fave place to have dim sum at the moment. They have good selections and all of the ones we tried (including the quintessential dumplings, offals or noodles) were fresh and tasty. I'm so glad they come to town!"
85,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What an awesome place to have dim sum and Cantonese/Chinese cuisine in Amsterdam!

93,Full Moon Garden, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"It was the worst experience for food ever. I am not a critical guy, but the food we got served (fried noodles) was neither fried, nor noodles. The meat was the worst I have ever tasted. It was just fatty, une joyable food imo. ‚Ä¶"
94,Full Moon Garden, 1 star ,2 years ago,The service could be improved but more importantly the dim sums didn‚Äôt taste very fresh. The Sui Mai had a fishy smell. I started getting terrible stomachache and diarrhea later at night after dinning here. Terrible experience.
95,Full Moon Garden, 2 stars ,7 months ago,It was unpleasant because there was a female clerk who was very unresponsive.  She didn't reply and seemed to ignore what we asked for.

97,Full Moon Garden, 1 star ,7 months ago,Bubble tea was pricy with very few bubbles. And bubbles was too soft outside and hard inside! Don‚Äôt try it!
98,Full Moon Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The roasted marinated duck was amazing, it was larger cuts than expected. The Meat was thoroughly marinated but not overpowering, the skin was crispy while the meat was tender. Dip a little bit of the sauce and you'll enjoy for sure. ‚Ä¶"
99,Full Moon Garden, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Unfortunately, the food was really disappointing. Also, the staff was not in a friendly mood. When we came in, nobody welcomed us. We were put in the corner next to the table where they prepared their take away service. As you can imagine, the ambience was not nice. Overall really bad experience!!"

114,Full Moon Garden, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good dimsum place around the corner of Leidseplein, decent quality and good price. A eat and go place not really a place to wine and dine for a long time. They do take out an delivery....check them out. Not the best, but definitely not bad."

118,Full Moon Garden, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Came on the day of the opening with a lot of hope!
Not a bad place but I was disappointed with the Xialongbaos. The crispy scallion pancakes were super good, the Char Siu and the Bao too.
