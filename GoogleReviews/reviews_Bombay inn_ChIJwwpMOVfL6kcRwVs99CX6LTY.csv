4,Bombay inn, 1 star ,3 months ago,Had the worst take away experience. The keema naan was not cooked properly and I couldn't serve it to my kid. The garlic naan was too thick. We ordered mixed veg curry and the cauliflower and broccoli in the curry was just raw.  We were …

11,Bombay inn, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best Indian restaurants I ever tried. Amazing traditional dishes, we've tried the Tikka massala and the vindaloo and they both were a blast! Highly recommended of you are nearby. Even with covid restrictions, the restorant is still open for take-away."

14,Bombay inn, 1 star ,a year ago,Food was below average. Main issue was when we asked for parcel. Person came with boxes and said you can pack the food. When I said no he started packing on the table itself. When we asked he gave non sense reasons and didn't even apologize. So much of attitude.
15,Bombay inn, 2 stars ,a year ago,"We ordered 1 chicken daiwala, 1 paneer korma and 2 cheese naan. Daiwala and Korma had exactly the same flavour (cream flavour), daiwala was just a bit acid due to the yoghurt. Both were FULL of cream with almost no spices or flavour. Paneer …"
16,Bombay inn, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Went to experience south Indian dish. Tried Idly-Dosa platter (only item in veg south indian), not good taste, chutneys not even close to ones you get in Sarvana bhawan. Chicken65 was very blend compared to other Indian-Nepalese restaurants.  Only saving grace were Chicken momos and good ambience. Lot needed for improvement."

18,Bombay inn, 1 star ,a year ago,"Very disappointed. I've ordered a couple of South Indian dishes and was surprised that it's not even close to what it's supposed to look and taste like. Moreover, they don't even match the description of the dish mentioned on the menu. When asked, the chef's response was that's how it's done. And description was a technical error."
