11,'t Nieuwe Kafé, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Almost all restaurants near hotspots in every big European city don't deliver. 'T Nieuwe Kafé is not one of them. The food, drinks and atmosphere are all equally good and the view of the beautiful Damsquare is just the icing on the cake. Highly recommended."

19,'t Nieuwe Kafé, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The Kafé is attached to the Nieuwe Kerk but can also be reached straight from the Dam. Prices are quite high a bit in line with the location in the centre of the centre of Amsterdam. Not pleasant that customers of the Kafé also have to pay for the toilet.
20,'t Nieuwe Kafé, 1 star ,2 years ago,Best location for a café but the worst service ever. Not for locals or tourists. Closing time is 18:00 so I sat there at 17:00 and they told me they were closed while serving other people ;) You are cancelled

26,'t Nieuwe Kafé, 1 star ,3 years ago,Croquettes tasted like the chef accidentally dropped the whole bag of salt in its preparation. The chicken in the sandwich is almost as dry and hard as beef jerky. Horrible lunch. And it wasn’t cheap.
27,'t Nieuwe Kafé, 1 star ,5 years ago,Waitress tells us they will close immediately but there is quite an hour left to the closing time written on the menu. Unfriendly and do not want to serve us any drinks.
