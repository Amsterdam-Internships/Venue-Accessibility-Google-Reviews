0,Barrica, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,I‚Äôve been wanting to go here for a while and it was well worth the wait! A really lovely restaurant and bar with amazing service and the food was delicious! A must-go but you absolutely have to book in advance as it‚Äôs got limited seating and very popular.
1,Barrica, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Really nice place for good food and wine with friends. Make reservations, it's often fully booked."
2,Barrica, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice ambiance, some interesting wine & good tapas. Great for any evening"
3,Barrica, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice decorated tapas like wine bar. Wine menu available as a label on a magnum size wine bottle. Variety of spanish wine and cava available. Good food to accompany their wine selection. They also serve one type of a beer. Try their hot flatbread with delicious greens, tomatoes and eggplant."
4,Barrica, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great Pizza, beautiful environment and nice service!"
5,Barrica, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent food, great service. A must visit, at least once, when in Amsterdam!"
6,Barrica, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good choice of wines and exquisite tapas to go along. It's more a tapas bar than a place for dinner, so good for sharing with friends and trying out different tastes. You can spend a pleasant evening here."
7,Barrica, 5 stars ,a year ago,First dining out experience since COVID 19 restrictions. Barrica followed safety guidelines and provided warm service. Oysters and mignionette were delicious! The pizza came out at the perfect temperature and the ingredients on the pizza were fresh. Thank you for a lovely experience!
8,Barrica, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service, food and wine. Lovely little terrace in our neighbourhood."
9,Barrica, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Stop seeking, because Barrica is a hidden gem in Amsterdam-West.
Me and my girlfriend had a wonderful evening. We are quite picky if it comes to good food and service, which is not a common thing in Amsterdam... ‚Ä¶"
10,Barrica, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great place, great food. Loved it!"
11,Barrica, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice wines, good snacks but not good menu for a real dinner. Place a little bit posh indeed. Prices for the wine are reasonable, but the food is WAY too much for the quality/complexity of the dishes. I would be back only for some glasses of wine after having dinner in another place nearby."
12,Barrica, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect for a date! Staff is friendly and food is brilliant! Lots of good wine, definitely a must! Really good in the summer, they have a cozy outdoor seating."
13,Barrica, 1 star ,5 years ago,Low your expectations if you know bout Spanish food because even although the menu seems to follow that kitchen the taste and looks is VERY far away. Prices are quite high for the quality of the products. The ambience is young and a bit ‚Ä¶
14,Barrica, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Our local go to cozy wine bar. Great service, good wine and nice little tapas. It gets busy so either go early or book if you can."
15,Barrica, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely food and friendly staff, wine was great too. It took a while to get served but understandable cos they were so busy. Can't fault the place"
16,Barrica, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great pizza, nice vibe and service!"
17,Barrica, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We were 4 of us, ordered 3 bottles of red wine and a bottle of cava plus so many dishes!! They were all delicious and I really love the vibe of this place! It was around 65 euros per person :) but well worth it and definitely coming back !!"
18,Barrica, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little place, good atmosphere, good dishes (Spanish/Italian). Burger was juicy. Portions are not huge but it is easy to order more if you run out of good stuff"
19,Barrica, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Gem! Probably among the best little spots in Amsterdam, especially for us the more..southern people! Ambience, food, people, wine.. all fantastic, happy to have lived around the corner!"
20,Barrica, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The pizza was only ok, one topping was missing. It was compensated though, and the waitresses were really nice and friendly."
21,Barrica, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Not a real Spanish nor an Italian place. Inflated prices and small portions. Small place with loud dutch clientele. Waiters are nice and friendly guys btw
22,Barrica, 5 stars ,a year ago,Good wine and great foccacia!
23,Barrica, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice place, ambiance and music.

Food is nice, but way too expensive (like times two) for the 'shareable dishes' you get.. Service is not the best, they serve you, but that's it."
24,Barrica, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent wine bar with very tasty food. Tasteful decor with different dining options (bar/long table/small tables/seats)
25,Barrica, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great bites, good wines. People are friendly. Sitting outside with the nice weather is a definite plus!"

28,Barrica, 2 stars ,a year ago,Nice pizza but it made our stomache burn. Quick service. Unfriendly staff.
29,Barrica, 5 stars ,2 years ago,More than just another wine bar in town; this one is definitely worth a visit!
30,Barrica, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great wines, good food. Pricing of the food relatively high looking at the portions"
