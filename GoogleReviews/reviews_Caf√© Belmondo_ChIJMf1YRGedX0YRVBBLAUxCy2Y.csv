0,Caf√© Belmondo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful and spacious seating area, indoor and outdoor in a very convenient location.
The food is okay but not great, perfect for friends gatherings. …"
1,Caf√© Belmondo, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The carrot cake looked mouthwatering and was delicious (and huge). Everything we ate was very sweet and rich. The place was really pricy though, you could grab a lunch instead, moreover, the prices were poorly labeled. A big plus for the generous opening hours. Spacious with a fresh decor."
2,Caf√© Belmondo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place doesn’t run with that name anymore. It’s a big Italian place with wide range of deserts and ice cream. I visited a couple of time, all the deserts we tried were good, however the quality of the coffee went down."
3,Caf√© Belmondo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Location is fine and the experience is very nice, but the ice cream is kinda bland. It has a very weak taste :(  can't say anything about the prices as I'm the first time in Stockholm, a scoop of ice cream is 20 Krona"
4,Caf√© Belmondo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I visited Cafe Belmondo today and decided to have a slice of walnut cheesecake. Little I had known that this would possibly be the worse experience I had... The cake tasted old, sickeningly sweet and it was not chilled as it supposed to be. …"
5,Caf√© Belmondo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Went into have the breakfast, and that was a huge mistake. For starters the staff isn't friendly at all, unless you are a regular. We ordered a simple scrambled eggs and bacon and it was a disappointment when it arrived. Portion was way too …"
6,Caf√© Belmondo, 1 star ,3 years ago,Really loud and untasteful music made it feel like I left innertown and was out in Kista all of a sudden. Price was unexpectedly high 55kr for an Americano and a majority of the customers were kinda fishy.. I'd say that Espresso House across the street or any other Café is a better choice.
7,Caf√© Belmondo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Eating here was not a good experience. Four out of five dishes were inedible/ had hair in them/ was not what was ordered. Not a place I'd recommend for warm dishes.
8,Caf√© Belmondo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Had scampi and salad and Swedish meatball - free flow salad and bread. Solid but nothing memorable - 350Kr for 2.
9,Caf√© Belmondo, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"Coffee ok, but food had an all over ""industrial touch"". Not very authentic. Had a bad biscotti and an icecream without taste. Pricy, even for Stockholm. Head elsewhere."
10,Caf√© Belmondo, 1 star ,3 years ago,Do not buy ice cream here. She deliberately fills it half way (keeps the bottom of the cup hollow). Tastes bland too.
11,Caf√© Belmondo, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Didn't accept cash. Quiet good coffee. But it served with an empty cup. I have to use valve to full my cup.
12,Caf√© Belmondo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very expensive! Nice location and furniture, but other then that nothing special. Would not visit again since the prices are too high."
13,Caf√© Belmondo, 1 star ,5 years ago,129:- for a Greek (???) salad with 2(!!!) coktail tomatoes och 4 kalamata oliver! Cheap cheese they pretend is Feta cheese. Never here again!
14,Caf√© Belmondo, 4 stars ,a year ago,"My favorite lunch place right now, with fantastic pizza."
15,Caf√© Belmondo, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"The salad was drowning in vinegar, warm sandwich tasted truly poor and even tea was superbitter, go elsewhere and save your money."
16,Caf√© Belmondo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We had a very nice lunch here, especially the salad buffet was a pleasant surprise."
17,Caf√© Belmondo, 1 star ,4 years ago,Unreasonably expensive. Dry and old buns and cakes. Rude staff. A typical tourist trap.
18,Caf√© Belmondo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Crappy restaurant in a good spot. Small servings, unfriendly staff and absolutely not worth the price."
19,Caf√© Belmondo, 1 star ,3 years ago,Expensive AF and food isn't fresh! Worst food experience in Stockholm I've had. Avoid this place
20,Caf√© Belmondo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place. High prices. Unfriendly staff. Ok coffee nothing special.
21,Caf√© Belmondo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The worst pizza ever, tastless and slaby. Dont eat here!"
22,Caf√© Belmondo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Tastless food, wrong food, hair in food. Bad service. Not willing to give full refund."
23,Caf√© Belmondo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, wish I got more food on my plate though."
24,Caf√© Belmondo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious soup of the day! Fish soup, great location too!"
25,Caf√© Belmondo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Quite ok for lunch. Good but not extraordinary
26,Caf√© Belmondo, 1 star ,4 years ago,Bad service. Half empty ice cream cup. Bad hot chocolate - really bad.
