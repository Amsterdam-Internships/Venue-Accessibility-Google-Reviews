1,Frenzi, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great cozy place, the dishes are beautiful, we had a tapas plate with beer and apple pie at the end. Everything was great !"
2,Frenzi, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Stopped by for a glass of wine on the cozy outdoor seating on the canal and ended up eating delicious aubergine fries ( not greasy at all) and a yummy panzanella salad to soak up the alcohol 😋.

9,Frenzi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Super tasty Spicy chicken sandwich for only €8.50, lots of meat and ingredients. Coffee is good as well. Nice vibe and music, super nice staff - polite, professional and courteous, but direct ( I like that, no N.america server bull shchi) definitely recommended!!"
10,Frenzi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good meals we took two times (the second time was due to the the high satisfaction of the first time). It's very copious and healthy ! May be Frenzi should try the yam chips 😉 Affordable for a couple of students in a week end trip. The best we ate in our journey !
11,Frenzi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We had amazing sandwiches with gorgonzola, tapenade, rucola and speck, they even have gluten free option for sandwich and prices are really honest for this quality and freshness. My rasperry smoothie was nice, the expresso was bitter though. The staff is friendly. A nice moment to eat healthy sandwiches watching the canals !"

15,Frenzi, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Staff..great..location..great..food hmm, short rib was delicious, but mussels were on the average end of what is expected for that kind of money.

16,Frenzi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice Place & Atmosphere, closee to a Canal, not cheap but okay for Amsterdam, maybe the Prices hold back the Tourist-Pack! Delicious Food, neatly arranged. Definitely recommend the Place!"
17,Frenzi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great bar, nice tapas!"
18,Frenzi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One time you just get tired of the loud and crazy central streets and pubs of Amsterdam and just strive for some piece. This is the place. The weather allowed us to sit on the pretty terrace they have, which was really quiet for a weekend …"

Turkey salad is full of raw onions... also for some reason staff didnt care that everytime they were going outside/back inside the door was smashing hard enough to make everyone in the restaurant jump (BANG). When I left, I carefully hold the door so it would not smash back... it was not too difficult."
44,Frenzi, 1 star ,3 years ago,"First they said we can't stay inside, so we sit down outside. There was a beer card on the table but nothing more. In 10 mins the waitress came and asked what would we like? A menu card. Then she came back in another 5 mins with the card, …"
