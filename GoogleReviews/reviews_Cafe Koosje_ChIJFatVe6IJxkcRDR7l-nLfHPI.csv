15,Cafe Koosje, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We saw this place and decided to pop in for a quick bite to eat. The staff come to the tables and take your orders, and we decided on pancakes and the mincemeat croquettes. Both were delicious and a nice quick introduction to Dutch food."

It came served with packet crisps on the side (unfortunately they were stale). ‚Ä¶"
30,Cafe Koosje, 1 star ,5 years ago,"One of my worst experiences in Amsterdam. The staff was unfriendly, we waited a lot for the pancakes, the forks were dirty and they didn't even apologize for it, the pancakes were overpriced and too dry and no one said bye to us upon leaving."

32,Cafe Koosje, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Popped in for a quick coffee and tosti to get out of the rain. The chocolate muffin wasn't the best but the staff was very helpful and even gave me an umbrella. With a classic interior, I'd be down to chill or work the day away there."
