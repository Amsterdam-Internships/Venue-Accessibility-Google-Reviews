0,Eazie, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"tl;dr: bit disorganized, bit expensive if you want to eat a filling meal. Not a lot of taste. ‚Ä¶"
1,Eazie, 1 star ,2 months ago,Bad service with a grumpy lady behind the counter. Trying to find difficulties and reasons not to help. I bought a Social deal offer for 3 pm and when we arrived they told me it is only possible after 5pm which was strange. They wouldn't ‚Ä¶
2,Eazie, 1 star ,2 months ago,"The wok was the worst ever, everything was not cooked well and not ready to eat. Bad smell from chicken meat. I don‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone else. Spend your money on a good one."

4,Eazie, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Not a lot of taste and raw vegetables not cooked enough. But delicious broth and noodles.
5,Eazie, 1 star ,4 years ago,"From the idea of the food, you would think healthy, but the ingredients were faaar from high Quality, especially store bought sauces that contained preservatives that gave a bland taste to any of wok dishes.  Service not speedy or friendly ‚Ä¶"
6,Eazie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I really liked my lunch here, it was fast and tasty! Workers have been nice and polite, also a place it's not looking bad! So we tried two different versions wok with fried rice, one was with tofu, veggies and Indonesian cocos sauce. ‚Ä¶"
7,Eazie, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We went in to sit down inside and  have a quick bite as we saw a nice picture of pokebowls. The result was a plastic square not fresh, miserable portion and looks. It is nothing worth a 10th of the price. We comunicated our discontent ( no reaction)walked out leaving the food and had to go eat elsewhere. Definitely not recommended."
8,Eazie, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Although they portray themselves as being fresh and healthy, the ingredients were not fresh. Frozen vegetables which become chewy and brown when cooked. Overall taste is unpleasant and artificial. Will not go back."
9,Eazie, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is fresh, taste is good and excellent value-for-money. There was a bit of a queue when we ordered and as such it took 25 minutes between ordering and serving but overall it was a good experience. I can't resonate with the negative reviews."
10,Eazie, 1 star ,3 years ago,A truly terrible dining experience. The concept of the restaurant is appealing but the execution was terrible and confusing. Our wok dishes took 25 minutes to make. We sat watching as 4 of the 5 employees avoided working until there were 10 ‚Ä¶

12,Eazie, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Perfect, healthy food that is prepared quick."
13,Eazie, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food was nice and ingredients were fresh. The concept is good showing the calories on each dish. Tables were not very clean. They looked a bit lost when bringing the food and drinks to the tables.
14,Eazie, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Customer service isn't brilliant, so don't go there on a date. But I think it's decent. I definitely prefer here to Wok to Walk. 1) the price 2) the taste 3) the options!! 4) THE PRICE.  You're likely to spend between 7-10‚Ç¨ and be full. 3 stars because come on... It's just Street food üòÇü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è not gourmet"
15,Eazie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Eazie is my favourite thing about business trips to the Netherlands! The food is fresh, healthy, delicious and cheap. I love the vegan option of tofu with garlic sauce on rice. There are many options, for all people not just vegetarian and ‚Ä¶"
16,Eazie, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Friendly service but a regular portion was smaller than expected, didnt fill me up. Unspectacular sauce with half-fresh ingredients but the price/quality ration was fine for me."

20,Eazie, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Yesterday we wanted to visit this restaurant in Amsterdam, because a friend recommended the food. The site said the restaurant would be open until 22:00. When we arrived at 21:35, we walked in, however the staff told us they were closed ‚Ä¶"
21,Eazie, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Wok was fine, but nothing special. Pokebowl was aweful, it was super cold, uninspired and dry. Feels like a place that focussen more about branding instead of making great quality food."
22,Eazie, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Quality terrible , I had dinner yesterday and got super sick of my stomach , and still sick I don‚Äôt recommend here !"
23,Eazie, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"If youre looking for a place that offers a  healthy meal for a decent price, eazie wok is the place to be. You can get a nice wok with quality vegetables of your own choosing. You never have to wait too long for your meal and you can even get a discount of you have a gym membership (fitforfree and some other gyms only). Great place."

27,Eazie, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The wok was good but very spycy ,  but please don't take smoothie,  we where 3 and none of them had the same taste,  Orange Juice mainly in each. I feel also disapointed about the team behavior ! care about the customer and smile"
28,Eazie, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Had to wait till all line makes their orders before he started making my cappuccino. It took me more than 10 min for a coffee to go. Though coffee is good
29,Eazie, 1 star ,2 years ago,"It was my first time in, nobody ask if I needed help, no English menu, we waited like 10 minutes in front of the till before someone asked if we needed something., Then we ask for a dish without pineapple and nuts and another not too spicy, then there were nuts and the plate was a volcano, uneatable. Never again."
30,Eazie, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Amsterdam does it again with fast casual. Good and healthy woks literally right next to the tram stop. Beautiful and clean toilets and a nice selection of magazines and other reading material at tables with USB ports and plugs. A bit pricey.
31,Eazie, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice stirfry dishes for a very good price. You can choose different options to make your perfect combo. Fast service with a smile. Try the special lemonades.

Entered the place saying hi and looking for a smoothie. None of the waiters ‚Ä¶"

37,Eazie, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Not nice food experience, slow service, they gave us wrong orders and when we asked for a change, we had to wait in a queue. DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED!"
38,Eazie, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing and affordable wok option!
