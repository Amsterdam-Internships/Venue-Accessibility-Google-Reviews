14,Al Argentino, 5 stars ,a month ago,Here are nice hotels and many restaurants.
15,Al Argentino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lots of bad reviews, I do not believe. I honestly liked the place. It's indeed quite pricy, but my medium rare rib eye steak was indeed medium rare, good fries and quite fast service. There was three of us, we had three steaks, five beers ‚Ä¶"
16,Al Argentino, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Only 2 stars for the ambiente. We ordered medium steakes and got bloody and still raw meat pieces. The workers didnt give us cutlery and we had to ask for it. Also waaay to expensive. 50‚Ç¨ for a drink and 400g of meat.
17,Al Argentino, 1 star ,3 years ago,Over priced and low quality food. My friend and I ordered steak and chips with curry on the side. The food wasnt great. My curry arrived after I was finished. I didnt really understand why. Our other friends arrived later and ordered a deal ‚Ä¶
18,Al Argentino, 1 star ,3 years ago,Very disappointed! Very expensive! Bad quality meat! I ordered a ribeye steak first bite was all gristle so I cut around the meat. It was very tough and chewy. I can see all the shiny gristle from the side to middle but I ate what I can ‚Ä¶
19,Al Argentino, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Extremely expensive for frozen food. Over 90‚Ç¨  for 2 large cokes, 2 starters, 2 mins and a side of onion rings. Presented nicely and steak was cooked well. More like a weatherspoons for me! Shame because they have put effort into the decor."
20,Al Argentino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best steak in Amsterdam . Our waiter was very funny and we had a fantastic evening.For dessert i will go to other places as they aren't the best in Al Argentino. But its definitely the place for steak and ribs,meat in other words."

22,Al Argentino, 1 star ,3 years ago,First I had to change from my 1. to the 2. and even to the third! Then after getting my there was nobody to get the order... Should've left then... The meat was ok but smaller than expected and nothing included! So you pay extra... ‚Ä¶
23,Al Argentino, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A very good place to eat steak I recommend a bife de lomo. It‚Äôs a small place in the street and it looks very tiny but they have a place underneath. Where you can have a nice view over the canal. You can enter it from the inside on the back ‚Ä¶

25,Al Argentino, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Not a bad meal - but this is in a tourist area and quality will not be high on the agenda but price will be. Having said that the meal wasn't bad. The steaks were tasty and cooked as requested.
26,Al Argentino, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"NOTHING Special about the restaurant! The ribs was dried out and smothered with sauce. The staid decor needs a facelift, and we skipped the dessert as I didn't want prolong my stay! My wife's dinner wasn't memorable either."
27,Al Argentino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food and German beer, fast serving, but slightly overpriced in my opinion (or portions could be bigger). Overall, soups around 6‚Ç¨, empanadas con carne 7-8, tortillas con guacamole (what is just corn chips from supermarket with guacamole) - 6, beer medium around 6."
