1,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,a month ago,I've missed travelling so much and I'm glad that there are places like this close by to remind us of good foreign food. If you looking for an amazing Ramen Pork Tonkotsu look no further. ‚Ä¶

3,Tjing Tjing, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"We went to the restaurant on the ground floor, next time we‚Äôll try also the bar at the top floor. Food was tasty and fun, we had lots of starters cause they sounded more interesting than the mains. Don‚Äôt miss the fries, the bao bun, the chicken skewer and the cheese cake."
4,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Food was delicious! We tried the pork ramen and one of each dessert. Definitely worth the visit. Staff was friendly and service was fast. Going to visit again when we are in the area!
5,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Really great food. A good sense of true Japanese and a good mix of the chef's personal twist on things. You can tatse the passion investment in the food

8,Tjing Tjing, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"3rd floor is a bar with lounge chairs inside and seating outside. Dimly lit with ambient lighting to set the mood, great for drinks before dinner. Staff are friendly and can make custom drinks on request, cocktails are quite pricey but ‚Ä¶"
9,Tjing Tjing, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"The food is truly unmatched!! Male waiters upstairs are a bit weird (like sneak their number on a napkin & when you don‚Äôt text them the next time you return they‚Äôll be very hostile). That aside, the food is truly amazing. Would be 5 stars if not for that x"

15,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Quality / price is great. I'd recommend to take sushi in matcha with fish and rice balls! The music and atmosphere are great as well, especially in the late evening. A bit tricky to sit with a big group at small tables, but that's a minor issue"
16,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great experience, good authentic Japanese food. My only complaint is our waiter who was a bit all over the place. Also beware of the mochi ice cream as although the ice cream is good the mochi itself is definitely an acquired taste."
17,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Nice place, friendly service, and even moved us after asking because it was too hot at the top level!
Their food is also very good and beautifully presented, with reasonable prices.
A have-to-ty place for any Asian Food Lover!"

21,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,a year ago,"If I could I would award this restaurant 7 stars. We dined at Torii in Tjing Tjing house. Everything was absolutely amazing. The cocktails tasted fresh, flavourful and aromatic and the food was outstanding. Highly recommend the sesame broccoli. The cheesecake was one of the best in Cape Town."
22,Tjing Tjing, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Cocktails was great. Ambience is lovely. Unfortunately the service and the mains were lacking. Waitress brought starters and mains out at the same time. We waited on a table to open up on the rooftop, when it did, we went to sit down only ‚Ä¶"

27,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Fast and friendly service, well presented portion of food, the vegeterian friendly side/tapas are great starters to share between two. Vegeterian Ramen was perfect consistency with the home made noodles. Nice chilled out atmosphere and funky Japanese setting. Will definitely be coming back."
28,Tjing Tjing, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Cool vibey spot on this little roof top bar. Fairly trendy crowd and music beats playing. Nice stop for pre or post dinner drinks, or even for dinner as they do have a Japanese themed menu."
29,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wow. Outstanding food and experience. Some unusual dishes accompanied by cards that add further story to the food. The last of the high end restaurants on our trip. We tried a lot. Including La Colombe. Easily top 3. A MUST try.

36,Tjing Tjing, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great starters/bites, ramen was okay-ish. Very homey and cosy inside feel and the roof top bar is a great addition before having supper. Your wait could become long depending on when you arrive as you can't make a reservation. Alcohol is rather pricey."
37,Tjing Tjing, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Tells my Partner and I that the bigger tables upstairs are reserved, even when clearly stating there are no reservations, and then allowing another couple 15mins later to sit at that bigger table just because no big group has arrived? ‚Ä¶"

40,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious Japanese food and cocktails! ü§§
41,Tjing Tjing, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice restaurant but food is not really Japanese. The miso ramen had no miso in it, the noodles used were soba noodles and not ramen noodles, the gyoza were served in the sauce and not separately, my green tea was served in a normal tea cup with saucer...... If you really want to eat Japanese, I can't recommend it."
42,Tjing Tjing, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I regularly frequent Tjing Tjing and have a variety of dishes at their floor level restaurant which are tasty and relatively well priced. They‚Äôre also really good at accommodating dietary concerns. Drinks at the bar have varied but I have had a few excellent ones in the rooftop bar and the middle space.
43,Tjing Tjing, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"A vibrant and modern take on the Asian experience. At times the vibe felt like a scene straight out of an amine or more specifically, that Frank Ocean Blonde Tribute video. ‚Ä¶"

47,Tjing Tjing, 2 stars ,6 months ago,If it wasn't for the good food and setting the outing would be the worst I have ever experienced. The waiters took long and was so disrespectful when they did arrive. I would say if you want a bite to eat for takeaways then it's a good ‚Ä¶

49,Tjing Tjing, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The service is an indisputable 5 stars. The ambiance and environment is quite the upmarket trendy Japanese restaurant as promised. There is however a trick to that. The parking and the waiting list... there's quite the wait for a table but ‚Ä¶

57,Tjing Tjing, 1 star ,3 months ago,"In an empty restaurant we were given limited options of seating based on the size of our party, due to the fact that that other patrons [might] show up and need our space. Server was rude"
58,Tjing Tjing, 4 stars ,8 months ago,My first time. Had a wonderful experience. Lovely food. Very tasty and prepared well. Restaurant offers different settings. Waitresses could be a tiny bit more attentive and friendlier though otherwise they did a good job. Will certainly go again!

65,Tjing Tjing, 1 star ,a month ago,Totally disgusted with the bad customer service and attitude of staff. You managed to ruin a very special for a young lady and her friends celebrating her 21st birthday.
66,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved the spirit of this place! Went for some cocktails on the top floor.... vibe was awesome!! Music was good.... and it has an open smoking section. The decor and general feeling is something to return to üòä

We ordered a variety of dishes which included their ramen, dumplings, tempura mushrooms, rice bowl, pork buns, etc."
90,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,a year ago,One of my go-to places in Cape Town. The restaurant (1st floor) has amazing Japanese/fusion cuisine with manga-like ambience and 3rd floor has a rooftop bar with half open ceiling. The cocktails that they make are one of the best that I‚Äôve tasted so far.

Not worth the effort it took to look for parking"
125,Tjing Tjing, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I cannot comment on the food but the drinks are fairly priced, it has a great vibe and rooftop bar usually has enough space to find a seat. Important to note however is that the bar does not offer any views over the city or ocean. Worth a visit though."

134,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great hip atmosphere with amazing Cocktails
135,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best rooftop bars you'll probably find in Cape town. It's not too fancy but really nice and intermate.

137,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I went to Tjing Tjing back in 2015 and again in 2019. The service remains wonderful! I especially like the cocktail menu which was retrofitted to the decor and ambiance. The different levels to the Bar with restaurant included is so fitting to spend a night out in Cape Town CBD.

142,Tjing Tjing, 3 stars ,11 months ago,Levels to the restaurant was interesting. I think that's the best I got. Smoking area had like what looked like a coffin which was weird.
143,Tjing Tjing, 4 stars ,10 months ago,Good customer service. Lovely design of the place. Acquired taste (Japanese food). Enjoyed it.
144,Tjing Tjing, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We went for lunch on a hot day in Cape Town. The service was great, food was excellent for the most part although the pork Ramen I had lacked a bit of flavour.

153,Tjing Tjing, 1 star ,3 years ago,The restaurant has a rooftop bar which serves drinks. The barmen did not appear to have much awareness of who was waiting and were impossibly slow when I attempted to get a drink (the bar was moderately busy - 3 people to a barman) On our ‚Ä¶

155,Tjing Tjing, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Unfortunately I had to give it 3 stars instead of 4 because of their service. The venue and the cocktails deserve 4 stars but you either have to know one of the barmen or send a pretty girl otherwise you'll be ignored and wait forever to ‚Ä¶

168,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is one of the hidden gems in Cape Town. The stairs to the roof have many patrons sweating by the time they get to the top. I guess it also filters out those who aren't serious about good views and good vibes. The Bohemian-ish deco is ‚Ä¶
169,Tjing Tjing, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Went there for brunch/lunch. Food was good enough but when I asked to have a look upstairs it was met with a very rude ""we are closed"" reply. Surely you can allow a person to go see what the upstairs venue look like for future reference."

174,Tjing Tjing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had an amazing evening at Momiji, an experience nearing La Colombe standards and service for a lot less money.

I still dream of that wagyu tho"
