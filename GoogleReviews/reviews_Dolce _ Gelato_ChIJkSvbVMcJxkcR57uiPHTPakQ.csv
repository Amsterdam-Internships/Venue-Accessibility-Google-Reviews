0,Dolce & Gelato, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Very nice lady working behind the glass. A wee pricy but expected around such tourist filled city. The food is super decadent and sweet. Good for a treat your self kinda day when you have a little extra money to spare.
1,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 months ago,"Tourist Trap - Waffles are heated up in the microwave, so they are not fresh and cost just almost 10 euros. Any Albert Hejn is fresher and much cheaper."
2,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,4 months ago,"A huge mistake going there… they’re not showing the prices, and when you oder a normal crepe, they charge you €13,5 after preparing it… it’s a less than normal crepe for a very high price. NEVER GO TO THEM!!! They are thieves"
3,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Shame I didn't read the reviews first would never have been caught out by this awful tourist trap.
It's a complete wonder to me how this place is still trading judging from all …"
4,Dolce & Gelato, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Paid this Kit Kat Waffle and Doughnut for €8. I guess this place was located at the heart of the city hence the customers below me are giving angry reviews about them getting ripped off. It’s delicious alright! Very tasty. Will go again on …
5,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Doesn’t even deserve 1 star. Paid 17,60€ for 2 crepes with Nutella and ice cream and it was not good at all. Also while we were waiting a client came in for churros and the employee microwaved them and it was 7.50€. Avoid this place it’s not worth a single penny."
6,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,It's SCAM. DON'T BUY ANYTHING. There are no prices. They put their low quality waffle into the microwave and once it's in the microwave you pay 9€!!! Just don't buy. They rip you off. It's a trap. This is a warning. …
7,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The Chocolate fountain at the entrance attracted tourists like me in, then everything went to hell. The prices were high, services were horrible, and they refused to give me a receipt after I ordered. DONT COME HERE."
8,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Looks better than it tastes. Super over priced waffles and desserts! It’s insane to spend around €20 in one plain waffle and an ice cream! I ended up here sadly because I let my self decide by their displayed goodies on the window! Ask the price before you enter, well it’s better if you just skip this place!"
9,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,We went there 3 days ago and the man that was there was making fun of us in this language and it was very obvious as i talked to them in Dutch and they replied back to each other in their language and were laughing. We bought a waffle and 2 …

15,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,Possibly the worst dessert I had in my life. Nothing like the ones they display in the window. It also tasted awful. Wanted to discard it after the first bite but felt bad about throwing it in front of the guy selling it so I took another …
16,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,a year ago,"I will never ever come back to this place again, The reception man was really not cool, he didnt let us take a seat enless we buy something. The food was really bad, it tasted like it was not made the same day which mean it's really old. …"
17,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,"DONT COME HERE! They charged me 9 euros for 2 coffees, and 9 euros for a waffle. How awful they wanna rip off every tourist! Also, when i asked the receipt, they gave me a piece of paper w the full price, and no specifics of each product, super weird."
18,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Horrible,

20,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,"There are no prices or menus anywhere, customer service was atrocious. The man served people out of order and when the food arrived, it was mediocre and grossly overpriced. €19.50 for a reheated waffle and a crepe. He also blatently tried to overcharge the woman in front of us. Avoid this place, it's a complete tourist scam."
21,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible business, no prices so when you come in and the workers try to guilt you into paying once you are told how much they want.  He asked for 31 euros for 2 waffles with whipped cream, and what could be argubally a small cookie and …"
22,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,DO NOT GO: no menu/list of what waffle is what. It looks tasty visually but the waffles are extremely stale. Overpriced and they don't write the price anywhere. Just charge you based on how you look it would appear. Very slow customer service and rude.

25,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,4 years ago,"SCAM! Tourist trap! No posted prices, they inflate your bill by suggesting that they are offering you toppings that are traditionally free (chocolate syrup, powdered sugar, etc.). They then charge fees between 1,50 Euro - 3,00 Euro. We had …"
26,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,"It's a tourist trap. The prices they show are for the dessert without anything (ever seen a crêpe without anything that costs 6 euros?!). So they keep putting things inside the crêpe (1.5 euro each, which you don't know), and in the end …"
27,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,"No menu available, they complain to explain the ""menu"" and they even correct each other while doing it. They complain that you are translating the options to your fellow tourists and it's taking too long to place the order. Then THEY FORGOT …"
28,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Absolutely TERRIBLE. We were recommended the brownie when we asked for something very chocolatey (which it wasn't) and not only was it €6.50, it was the worst brownie we've ever tasted in our lives. They don't have any set prices -- two of …"

32,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,Absolutely disgusting!!! Do not go there. Wish I had read  reviews before being ripped off. The churros were burnt and not cooked in middle. Oil obviously too hot. When I questioned the man about this his response was “ that’s how we cook …
33,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Waffles advertised at 3 euros 50 cent and after ordering 2 were presebted with a bill of 22 euros. The waffles were undercooked also. Rip off merchants, do not visit unless you enjoy being ripped off. One star is generous"
34,Dolce & Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Popped in to buy as piece of cake whilst on holiday....it was my birthday and we all deserve cake that day after all!! We were going to take it away, and when paying the guy behind the till heard my friend question the price (€8.50 a slice) …"
35,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Bad food. Terrible service. Horrible place.

40,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If there was 0 star I would put it. Terrible waffles, hard as stones! Broke 2 knives to try to it it, at the end it went into the bin. 27 euros for 2 waffles and a small coffee. Thieves!"
41,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Its been said before but I’ll say it again: this is a tourist scam. No prices on anything (which is breaking the law actually), food is old and stale, and they charge 5€ for a cupcake. 0 stars is what I give them. This place is a ripoff."
42,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,5 years ago,It's a scam. I thought that I paid for a high quality Bio waffle and  muffin (£15). The waffle was very dry and old. I did not manage to find the shop back to ask for my money back. …
43,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Worst tourist trap ever, EVER! I ask for a waffle (3.50€ in the board). The man at the counter put the waffle in the microwave (it wasn't even fresh) he ask me if I want cream on top. I said yes. I had 20€ ready to pay. He took the cash …"
44,Dolce & Gelato, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Watermelon ice-cream was such a disappointment. At some point tasted like fermented watermelon. Tiniest scoop in a massive cone. The person behind the counter was less than friendly and the prices are ridiculously high for the poor quality of the ice-cream.
45,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,4 years ago,"They keep the old food in a fridge and when you ask for something, they will go to the back of the store and get you an old product instead of the fresh one that they are showing where the counter. A small cup of ""hot chocolate"" (chocomilk …"
46,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Watch your change: these people are thieves. Hardly worth writing a  detailed review. See others. Overcharging customers is a given here, expect your waffle advertised at 3.50 to be charged at 7 euro plus, and to get abused when you …"

49,Dolce & Gelato, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"No proper price list. Extra expensive. Tasty macaroons. Maybe the 6macaroons for €11 is okay. But the sweets too pricy. Would not come back, unless prices would be shown and if it would be cheaper"
50,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Mini pancakes we bought were absolutely unedible, hard and rubbery and we had to throw them out. Hygiene is also quite awful, the server was handling the food with hands without washing them after loading supply crates moments earlier."

54,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,Guy tried to scam us by charging us twice then acting like he didnt speak English. Even worse that he took a stale waffle from the display (may have sat there for days) and thew it in the microwave and handed us this disgusting hard slab a fork couldnt even break. Avoid at all costs - big tourist scam.

58,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,Paid 30 euros for 4 stale and frankly tasteless desserts. So wish we looked at reviews first - what a rip off.
59,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Got 80% the way through an exorbidentaly priced waffle with cream and Oreos and found the middle was mouldy, like fluffy green clump mouldy. Horrible! Thank god he refunded me. But it doesn’t undo the fact that I ate mould. Clearly they don’t monitor how long things are in the cabinet."
60,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We shared a strawberry tart that was 9 euros, in hindsight, would have decided against it and tried out other dessert shops in the area."
61,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,騙觀光客! I should have checked the review here.  Churros are not churros here!  There’s no even sugar and cinnamon but watery chocolate sauce on top of soft churros..  The staff was polite though
62,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Go somewhere else - plastic-cheese cake and horrible music.
Seats are supposed to be cute but at just uncomfortable. The cheesecake tasted and felt like sweetened plastic. The coffee and vanilla ice cream were ok."
63,Dolce & Gelato, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Tried nutella crepes and gelatos, it was good but not great. Highly overpriced and not worth the money. Crepe with nutella cost around 8 euros !! and a single scoop of ice cream around 2.25 !"

66,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If there is 0, I would leave 0.  DO NOT COME HERE!!! There is no price tag. They just price their products as they want and it’s extremely higher than the market. I must say it again”DO NOT COME HERE.”"

85,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,4 years ago,I had bad experience with this. I was speaking with him (egyption guy) in English language and I asked him pancakes he replied in Arabic (he see my face is Arab face) when I asked him about the meaning of the word that he starts sticking. …
86,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very overpriced, two small cakes for €17.50, don't think they care for returning customers, rinsing the tourists!"
87,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,4 years ago,Horrible service. First we were allowed to enter as the guy was closing even though they didn't look like they wanted to serve. Got kicked out as soon as I bought a waffle and a coffee because the owner wanted to close up for the night. Literally asked to get out asap
88,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,If you are willing to be tricked that's the shop to go. Unfriendly people and prices way way way to high. Definitely find yourself a different place to eat.
