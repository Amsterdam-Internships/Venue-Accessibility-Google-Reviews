0,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Arguably the best pizzeria in the city and they serve a lot of really outstanding pizzas.  They also have an outstanding menu of Italian dishes here. It’s quite upscale here but 2 people can enjoy a pizza meal here for around 600 pesos. It is worth it.
1,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My fave is the Robertino. I'm never disappointed when I go there. I just love the pizza and the very accommodating staff. They will have new menu soon, so it's something to watch for"
2,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Disappointed with how the food turned out. But maybe because we came in an hour before closing? But still... The carbonara looked like cream noodle soup and tasted way too milky. Pizza was okay. The lady staff was very acvomodating and nice though. The restaurant could a little more light.
3,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very authentic Italian cuisine. The seafood pasta is superb. The thin crust pizzas are very tasty. The staff are friendly and attentive to your needs. Even the owner, (the Italian guy) is very accomodating and suggests what to try in their extensive menu. Overall, this place is excellent."
4,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 1 star ,11 months ago,"The inside of the restaurant had a nice ambiance and the menu had a good selection of Pizza, Italian and Spanish cuisine. I ordered the lasagna and my wife got the Hawaiian pizza. The lasagna looked like it had been made several days prior …"
5,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was great, ambience is ok, staff was excellent, facilities such as toilet could use an upgrade (it isn't dirty but it is not what you expect from such a place). Music/band was great. My husband and I loved the vocals especially of the male singer. Overall good experience."
6,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"My bf liked the food he ordered but I didn't like mine that much. Still, it was good."
7,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 4 stars ,a year ago,The lasagna and pork ribs were excellent. The restaurant was very clean and easy to find. My only complaint was the surprise 10% service charge that I have not experienced at any other Cebu restaurants. It's listed on the menu in very small …
8,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best pizza I had in all of Asia: juicy center, crunchy edges, minimal toppings, and maximum taste
Over 14"" pizza that was so light that I could finish all of it …"
9,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Taste of pasta and pizza is still good as before. But, the place seem like warehouse. There are a lot of products like snacks, masks, face shields for sale. Waiter is wearing just a t-shirt and short pants like local restaurant. Also, price is higher than before. Not worth it."
10,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If you're looking for great pasta in Cebu, this is definitely the restaurant for it."
11,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 1 star ,7 months ago,"me : there is a small fly in my drink

14,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Best Italian-Spanish Restaurant in Cebu
15,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Overrated and mediocre, expensive. It seems like they use better ingredients (imported??) but don't know how to put them together properly. Pasta and the pizza were bland. Did I really pay that much??? Super expensive.  Pizza crust was …"
16,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love their egg rolls! A bit pricey but super worth it because they're so delicious. :) I love that they're open 24 hours, but wifi is weak and seats are hard & uncomfortable, so it's not a great place to hang out, but a great place to eat then get to your next destination. :)"
17,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A little bit pricey but food is yum and it is worth it.
18,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,This was my go to Italian restaurant a couple of years ago. Just went back to this place after a while and I can say the food still taste great. Excellent pasta dishes. …
19,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The dishes taste good. They also give you a different menu which is from a Spanish restaurant nearby where you can also order from that restaurant. You'd have to wait for 30mins to get your order from the Spanish restaurant. And prices are expensive in both restos.
20,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The only pizza place in cebu that I personally like after Handuraw. I'm quite glad they paired up with Hola España, which serves terrific Paella Arroz Negro. Ample parking space nearby, and like the rustic ambiance and lighting."
21,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 2 stars ,a year ago,Pizza crust like cookie dough. No thanks. Please change to napoli style. Topping was ok.

24,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I love the abiance and fod here. The waiters are very prompt and cordial. Its not too pricey and the food seection is quiet okay. Athough more vegetarian and vegan food selections would be great.
25,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food and great ambience. To be honest, I like the place because there's not a lot of people in it. The place is set up to have intimate dinner or meeting place with family or colleagues."
26,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great Italian food, some of the best in Cebu. The pizzas are thin crust, almost like a tortilla. I recommend the pizza diavola."
27,Pizzeria Michelangelo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food. Service is even better.
