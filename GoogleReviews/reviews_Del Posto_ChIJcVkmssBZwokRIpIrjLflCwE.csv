36,Del Posto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Such an amazing place.  It is very dim with soft lighting and has such a great ambiance.  The wait staff was professional and polite.  The food was amazing.

37,Del Posto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Attended a private party here and we chose the 8 course menu over the 5.

50,Del Posto, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing ambience, service and food. Price is reasonable for this level of offering in NYC. There's a darker romantic feel to it. Service tends to be more formal. Wear a jacket, guys! It lives up to 4 stars NYT rating."

59,Del Posto, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The greatest hospitality I have ever experienced has been at Del Posto.

Possibly the greatest dining experience I have ever had."
60,Del Posto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Outstanding experience! Just celebrated our anniversary there, pricey, but you get so much more than just food.

66,Del Posto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The service here was exceptional. The prix fixe lunch menu was also exceptional. Complementary tidbits offered with the courses.

73,Del Posto, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The atmosphere and service here are impeccable. The dishes were well-executed and enjoyable, but not memorable. We had the Captain's Menu, and while each course was delicious in the moment, it was easy to forget what we had already eaten. …"
74,Del Posto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"From the time we arrived till we departed Del Posto met all our expectations. It is not a convenient location even though we live in NYC and we “save” it for special occasions—in this case, a Birthday. The food was outstanding and everyone …"

81,Del Posto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The ambiance and setting is gorgeous. Service is impeccable. And the food is divine! The dessert is perhaps the weak link but it's still very good. Expensive meal but totally worth it. Expect to spend 2+hours to have a sumptuous meal!
82,Del Posto, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a nice dinner here, had the testing menu, the service was outstanding. The food was nice, but I was expecting a little bit more (not portion size).

124,Del Posto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,An amazing experience.  I came here to treat the wifey for her birthday dinner and the place did not let down.  The food is amazing and the service is top notch.  Definitely worth going for a real nice dinner.  Make your reservations!
125,Del Posto, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Don't waste your money on this restaurant. Nice ambiance but the food is not very good. Over the course of the meal, at least 6 or 7 different servers came out and presented each dish with an elaborate narrative, how it was made and what is …"
126,Del Posto, 4 stars ,8 years ago,This one of Mario Batali's restaurants in the NYC. I've been to Babbo and Otto and this is one is definitely the fanciest. I came here for dinner with a group and we did the 5-course tasting dinner. …
127,Del Posto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What can you say about a perfect experience at a location that never disappoints? The Chase ""Insider Experiences"" night brought forth the best of the bar, apps, 3 mains and a dessert to die for. Wine pairings were perfect."
128,Del Posto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is not a place that you casually decide as a dinner choice. Come here to relax have a great dinner with amazing service. Our waiter made a new dish for us because we didn't like one of them and it was my favorite dish. You will pay for the excellent food and service but YOLO
129,Del Posto, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Greeted by a beautiful young lady who doesn't know what a professional service industry should be. Seated at a table with cold draft. No response to a request. Waitress was very nice. Bread and butter: exceptional. Pork was delicious but …

131,Del Posto, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the pastas was slightly undercooked.  However, food tasted good. A lot of good options for the tasting menu. Dessert was good also. Service was great. Price: I thought it was a little steep, the batali name probably increased the price. But overall, food and service was great."

133,Del Posto, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is an awesome restaurant. They have live piano music, lovely customer service. I was seated right away! Wine selection was to die for. I went to Italy a few months ago, and I have to say, their food was so much better than most of the …"
134,Del Posto, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Went here for dinner with a friend on her recommendation and was surprised that they were kid friendly. The service is modern with an old world feel. Rest everything from the light piano playing live music to the dining cutlery and glassware is very luxurious, but in a relaxed setting."
135,Del Posto, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing place. I had a horrible experience there 7 years ago but decided to give it another try. I am really happy I did because the place has completely changed. Service is warm and welcoming, no longer cold and robotic. The food is easily …"

145,Del Posto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best meals I’ve had in NYC. Been to Del Posto three times, and each time did the captain’s menu. Everything is always delicious, especially the amuse bouches and the bread with cream (that looks like cheese but tastes like butter)."
146,Del Posto, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Overall, we enjoyed a wonderful experience. The interior is expansive and high ceilinged, the settings were luxurious, the service was impeccable, and the food was extraordinary. We opted for the five (5) course tasting menu, that included …"

150,Del Posto, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Still love this place, but only three stars. They reluctantly brought out the a la carte menu when we said we couldn't deal with the five/seven course menu, and the sommelier couldn't recommend a wine for less than $150. Seems they're …"

153,Del Posto, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"The fix menu was quite an experience. It has a healthy dose of seafood, which I often find lacking in other places; I was only left wishing for more dessert. It was the right amount of food, not oversized like in other luxury restaurants, …"
154,Del Posto, 5 stars ,4 years ago,What an amazing culinary experience!  We went for my cousins bday and chose the 8 course tasting.  Flavors danced in my mouth the entire evening.  The small portions of the tastings filled us but the flavors is what is remembered after leaving.  An amazing experience.

157,Del Posto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Simply amazing. Food and wine pairing is top notch, but even better was the experience of the night and the courtesy of the staff. Better than even some 3-star Michelin places. Can't wait to come back again."
158,Del Posto, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Charming Restaurant. Went there on New Years day for lunch. We had the 3 course-tasting menu and added a 4th course to split. The chestnut ravioli, burnt beef and spicy lamb were all wonderful as was everything else. The wine sommelier was …"

164,Del Posto, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"The atmosphere and environment was wonderful! The pasta was excellent and service was great. However, it is risky getting anything besides the pasta.

168,Del Posto, 5 stars ,8 years ago,There is nothing about this place that doesn't impress. The service is top notch and friendly. The atmosphere is classy yet not stuffy. The food is...well the food is damn good. Grab a big bold glass of red wine and dive into any of the amazing dishes. Make sure you try the lasagna!
169,Del Posto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What's an incredible dining experience. Five course tasting menu impressed at every turn and accommodated a variety of dietary restriction a at the table. Highly recommend for special occasions.
170,Del Posto, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Dining at Del Posto is an experience for itself. If you're thinking about going there for the first time, make it for dining alone and not for some other occasion. Otherwise, you will be overwhelmed and miss out. Food there pleases and …"
171,Del Posto, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food tasted very good for a picky eater. The Insalata di LATTUGHE e ERBE di Stagione was quite interesting, vinegar was extremely strong but I liked it. BRANZINO Sotto Sale con Polpo e Patate was very tasty. We also ordered sea bass and …"
172,Del Posto, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Never fail to impress guests and visitors when one takes them to Del Posto. The executive chef did change the menu a bit. Now it has a French flare on top of being the finest Italian restaurant. Don't miss chef Melissa's signature pasta, it is even better than the hundred layer lasagna!"
173,Del Posto, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Came here for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. First impressions go a long way, and Mr. Batali doesn't disappoint. There are several dining areas and even a secret private dining area by the bar. Atmosphere is dark and classic …"
174,Del Posto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Whenever I go to a place with rave reviews and Michelin stars, I am very cautious to not let my perception be biased and primed beforehand.I love carpaccio. Usually restaurants hide undesired flavors of lower quality meat with too much of everything else that distracts from the star of that dish. This carpaccio was legit though."
175,Del Posto, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is a great location for seeing lots of sites. The hotel itself was very nice. The hotel staff were friendly & very helpful. The room was spacious & very clean, nice beds/pillows. The morning light breakfast & afternoon wine/cheese were very good! I would definitely recommend this hotel."

178,Del Posto, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"The $39 prix fixe lunch is a steal.  (The recent decision to require a $10 pp supplement for pasta was disappointing, but the pasta is always excellent.)  Fine food in an elegant setting, including a pianist.  The food choices are all so …"
179,Del Posto, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Their lunch menu is still the big deal in the city. I wont mention the price as it is ridiculously cheap. I´ve been there many times and the staff is outstanding and extremely attentive, even when you are wearing your jeans after work and …"
180,Del Posto, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We just had a lovely dinner from start to finish! Staff was friendly and prompt, bringing us extra bruschetta appetizers and a panna cotta to die for. Our pasta was fresh and flavorful, with an extra cheer for the  delicious lasagna. All topped off with sweet peach Bellinis. Definitely coming here again soon."
181,Del Posto, 5 stars ,9 years ago,The food was excellent. The spaghetti with dungeness crab and jalapenos was particularly good. The veal chop was also remarkable in quality and in preparation. …

184,Del Posto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice atmosphere. Dimly lit and sophisticated. Interior is very classy and the staff delivers top-notch service. Highly recommended for first dates if you can afford it
185,Del Posto, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This restauran is only elegant that’s it, the food is horrible, the give you less than hour hand palm. Ye, good attention but no food, and food was horrible, far from being “authentic italian”. Is way way over priced. I do not recommend this place . Is not worth the time or money."
186,Del Posto, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"Here's the problem. Staff is trained to sell the $125 and $145 full dinners and menus make it hard to order a la carte as they aren't priced that way. However, appetizers are $30, first courses $35, entrees $45 plus up charges. Once you get …"
187,Del Posto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fabulous food and experience.  Only trouble is that there is so much food.  It is deceiving. Portions are small but filling.  By the time the entree came along, I could only eat half.  My husband was thrilled as he ate his dinner and my half.  All good."
188,Del Posto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A must go! Be ready for some amazing 5 or 7 course meal. You might find your dinner getting way too long, so, you can ask the staff to speed it up by reducing gap between the courses. Deserts are the best part!!"

192,Del Posto, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I arrived a few minutes early for my reservation and waited for them to ""set the table"" for 20 minutes before leaving. Kept asking what was going on and they said ""a few more minutes"" several times. Were they crafting the table from scratch …"
193,Del Posto, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"November 2018 update. As you can see below, a great experience four years ago. This year for a significant celebration it was almost the total opposite. Food and service so different. Touristy vibe, unsophisticated service, mediocre …"

195,Del Posto, 5 stars ,10 years ago,"Wow, frankly. Huge, impressive, European-style building with charming waiters and food that sits at the perfect point between fine dining and hearty. Our Zagat-hosted meal in the private dining rooms, lined with fancy wine, was just amazing …"

197,Del Posto, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great cozy restaurant.  Portions are very large and rich so it's a great place to spilt dishes.  I went with one of my girlfriends and we spilt an appetizer and pasta dish and both came out super full and happy.

202,Del Posto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great Italian cuisine with impressive interior and service. The price is expensive but the quality of food and service makes it worth it. Would recommend the place for a special occasions or important business meetings.
203,Del Posto, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I took someone visiting from the UK for a business lunch here. Their prix-fix lunch is one of the best deals in the city for just under $40. I truly enjoyed all the courses and I will be going back soon
204,Del Posto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A couple dishes were a little salty, but feel like that's a matter of taste. Otherwise this is an absolutely gorgeous restaurant where the entire experience is worth the cost."

207,Del Posto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"5 for 5 wines on alternating Saturday is the best not well keep secret in the area. A must for wine lovers, aficionados, and anyone who just likes wine and is willing to learn history and tasting from master sommeliers in a roaring 20's-esque environment."
208,Del Posto, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible service, on a not very busy Sunday! food wasn’t good at all! Tasted like it just came off a heat lamp. The waitress was a robot and didn’t even bother to mention the food my 12 yr old ordered would have chili on the pasta! Oy! Won’t step foot there again."
209,Del Posto, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was excellent , can't be to many native New Yorkers that eat here and I'm not a big fan of the over complication of Italian food"
210,Del Posto, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"If you want to be treated like a king or queen, then head to Del Posto.  There is a reason why they earned the james Beard award for best service.  The food is so wonderfully prepared - please, order the lobster and the gnocchi - and the …"
211,Del Posto, 5 stars ,10 years ago,"Quite simply, one of the best dining experiences I have had. Period. Everything we ate was exquisite. The sommelier was beyond helpful. And the room was gorgeous. Service was unhurried, solicitous and warm. Worth the splurge."
212,Del Posto, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Oh my how do you even describe an experience like this it was fantastic ,   from start to finish everything was 5 star and well worth the $1000 check at the end of service. I experienced the captains menus and put our dining experience in …"

214,Del Posto, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Hamachi appetizer was excellent. Wine list was extensive and well priced. The whipped creme fraiche was off the chart. The primi selections were better than the secondi. Service by wait staff was somewhat inattentive.

217,Del Posto, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"What a disappointment!  Yes, the room is magnificent, maybe even a little over the top.  But we found the service to be atrocious.  We had an early reservation so the place was pretty  empty and yet it took 15 minutes to seat us.  When I …"
218,Del Posto, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Superb dining experience. We were 4 and had the 5 course tasting menu which was outstanding. We left extremely full and satisfied. The service was excellent and overall well worth the money for the experience.

225,Del Posto, 5 stars ,6 years ago,One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Impeccable service in a more formal but unstuffy environment. Everything was gorgeous except the tonnato (just not for me). Dessert was extra delightful. La sigh!
226,Del Posto, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"For a Michelin star restaurant, it's actually underrated in NY.  Yes the decor is a bit stuffy but ignore that and just enjoy the food and the live piano music.  Also ignore the regular butter and spread the lard on your bread.  Lunch prix fixe is one of the best in all of NY."
227,Del Posto, 5 stars ,8 years ago,Del Posto is simply a gem! It is one of those rare places that fostered love at first sight. The service is impeccable. The first hint was when one of the service staff unobtrusively picked up my wife's handbag from the floor and placed it …

230,Del Posto, 5 stars ,5 years ago,One of the best meals I have ever had. Sat up at the bar and Estelle took care of us. She is one hell of a mixologist and definitely knows her stuff. I'd add a 6th star just for her. Not cheap but very much worth it.
231,Del Posto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing . I’ve eaten at a lot of top notch restaurants and this was one of the best meals I’ve ever had. Everything was beyond delicious. Yes it’s pricey but it’s definitely worth it.
232,Del Posto, 4 stars ,5 years ago,It was an exceptionally elegant dining experience. Best service I've ever had.   But it's really overpriced. There is nothing you can do to a tiny lasagne appetizer besides having Jennifer Aniston deliver it to me to justify it costing $89

234,Del Posto, 2 stars ,2 years ago,3 star food with 2 star service for us on a December Saturday night all with 5 star venue and price.  Took us 4 hours to get the meal done.  Needs improvement.

The food, setting, presentation, and service is as good as it gets.  This is also a romantic spot for a special evening.  I cannot wait to return."
238,Del Posto, 5 stars ,8 years ago,Fantastic contemporary Italian menu. Deco fells a bit old men's club but one can always disregard that when eating truffles and being pampered while eating good food. Be prepared to dig deep into your wallet - although worth every penny.
239,Del Posto, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is not simply a meal, it is an experience.  I enjoyed a meal from the pre-fixe lunch menu.  Each course presented like a work of art - and delicious.  Staff cordial and attentive to customers' needs."
240,Del Posto, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Not the best Michelin star restaurant I've ever had. A few courses were mediocre. The service was flawless. The room was great.
241,Del Posto, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Exceptional food and service. Bring your fancy pants. Menu is unique; not your average dishes, even by Batali's standards. Pastas are spot on. Sorbets are (oddly) the highlight. Prices are up there."
242,Del Posto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Grand dining in style, ambience, and service.  Beautiful, delicate courses executed perfectly.  Modern Italian in an ambience of old-world grandeur"
243,Del Posto, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Top end haute Italian dining at its best. Mario Batali’s flagship does not disappoint. Impeccable service, decor and food.  Expect a big bill but you definitely get what you pay for and it rarely disappoints."
244,Del Posto, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Had the Captain's Menu.  Lobster with brown butter balsamic sauce was one of top dishes I've ever eaten.  Did not have one bad dish.  A lot of thought and care put into every aspect of dinner.  Just a bit too expensive for me.
245,Del Posto, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"No matter you've got the money for this place.  Just buy a pound of salt and eat it by the spoon!  There was so much salt in my beef tartar (crudo, in italiano), after a few bites my tongue literally was stinging.  Stinging.  I asked …"
246,Del Posto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lunch was amazing. If you need to get away for 4 hours and enjoy impeccable food, this is the place. Wine pairing is a must."
247,Del Posto, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I don't know what I was thinking when I went here. The food was good, but the service was pretentious and the prices were absolutely outrageous. Save the money and go to three great restaurants elsewhere in the city."
248,Del Posto, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I could take you through the five course memorable gastromic tour, but words are not going to get you there. If you want to experince flawless service, food, and presentation you owe yourself a trip here. Salads, Pastas, main courses and …"

253,Del Posto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"All I can say is wow. What an experience. I took my husband here for his birthday. It is expensive, but worth every single penny! We both loved it!"
254,Del Posto, 3 stars ,11 years ago,"Great bar tender but then meal went to hell.  Neglectful service, mixed quality food, gven a terible table when others were open.  Left with both copies of bill and walked slowly to the coat room and then a taxi.  Waiter finally came out as taxi was pulling away--10 minutes after we left the table.  We won't be back."
255,Del Posto, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Extremely overpriced. The food was not not hot upon arrival. Waited very long between courses.  Portions were extremely small.  Walked out of restaurant hungry.  The atmosphere was dark and gloomy.  Never again.  Not worth it.
256,Del Posto, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"5 star dining experience! I didn't do the tasting menu but had a fabulous experience, nonetheless. We sat in the dining room which was a little more private. I felt like I was in someone's house. We were served complimentary white bean soup …"

258,Del Posto, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"My experience at Del Posto, notwithstanding all the hype, has been sub-par. The entrance and its interior is grand, but the service can be less than ideal, especially if you are not dressed right for the grandeur of the place. The food is …"
259,Del Posto, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"This one-Michelin star restaurant under Joe Bastianich and Mario Batali continues to serve some of the best Italian in the city. While dinner offers a dimmer, more romantic experience, the lunch prix fixe here is one of the best values to …"
260,Del Posto, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"An impressive setting and rather more than a few cuts above your standard Italian, but I found the flavors a bit one dimensional. Actually three dimensional - salt, fat, and tomato! …"
261,Del Posto, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"When it comes to Italian food, I’d rather have my families cooking EXCEPT when it comes to this restaurant.  Highly recommend trying the tasting menu, which is over the top delicious.  One of the best restaurants in the city."

264,Del Posto, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"While most finer establishments in NYC are a bit more casual around lunch, that definitely isn't the case in Del Posto. Check your coat AND your phones/purses or risk being (nicely) asked to place them off the table on a footstool. The …"

282,Del Posto, 3 stars ,11 years ago,"no complaints on the food but as we had the grand new yorkese (7-course tasting), the service felt a bit rushed. we could've finished everything in under an hour if we wanted to - each course just kept coming without any breaks."

291,Del Posto, 3 stars ,11 years ago,We had the worst dinner here. Have no idea how they have 4 stars. Service was terrible as was the food. We sent one dish back because it was not even edible. Do not waste your money on this sham of a restaurant. Maybe the dishwasher was making the food that night.
292,Del Posto, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"""I came here for lunch and was able to grab a table at 2pm no problem.  any restaurant who has 3 food icons casually sitting by the bar during their lunch time is good for me. The service is impeccable here and don't be swayed by the …"

300,Del Posto, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The definition of fine dining. This is what you should expect from a Michellan star restaurant. Go for a late lunch and order a bottle of wine and feel like a king without paying a Kings ransom.
