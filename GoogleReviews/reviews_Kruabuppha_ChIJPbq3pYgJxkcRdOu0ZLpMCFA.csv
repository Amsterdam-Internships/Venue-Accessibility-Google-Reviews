0,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,The food is LOVELY and the staff is just as nice and welcoming. Our hostess was accommodating and they seated us very close to closing and still everything was amazing.
1,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Lovely place with friendly staff. I love the food, esp. the red curry. There are lots of options to choose from. It is a known place in the local area for its good Thai food!!"
2,Kruabuppha, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Not sure why it‚Äôs highly rated, the dishes are ok but not impressive, the rice is not tasteful at all. With the same price, I would love to go to other Thai restaurants."
3,Kruabuppha, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good Thai food with plenty of options. I got the green curry with chicken and it had just the right amount of spice. There aren‚Äôt many drink options and the service wasn‚Äôt the best so would probably do take-out next time.
4,Kruabuppha, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly family restaurant. It‚Äôs usually not busy so they prepare food when you order. Lots of choices on the menu, vegetarian or meat. The banana loempia was good, stir fry is a bit salty but still delicious. Overall it‚Äôs a casual place for dinner."
5,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had the beef with thai basil, thai red curry and the fish cakes. Spice level was on point and the fishcakes were melt-in-your-mouth soft. Would recommend! We liked our curry spicy, but if you want it more mild, just tell the staff and they will help you!"
6,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best Thai in town! This is a family owned thai restaurant with fantastic, authentic food. Personally I would definitely recommend the fish cakes or the beef with basilicum. Service was also great."
7,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great place, great food, great dude who runs it. Nothing bad to say, apart from charging for tap water... but the curry more than made up for it"
8,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very delicious Pad Thai! The chili is very hot too, which I like cuz it feels authentic! Would love to have a wedge of lime still."
9,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great Thai! Just moved here and I was surprised that this Thai was so close by. Friendly staff. I would come here way more often if the portions where bigger and the pricing was less expensive.
10,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Possibly the best Thai I've ever had. Deceptively looks like your typical small, family-run Thai restaurant (which I believe it is!) - but the food is absolutely delicious. ‚Ä¶"
11,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was fast. Came on a Friday evening.
The chicken fried rice was delicious! The Thai iced tea was very smooth. The staff kept checking in to make sure we were enjoying our meal."
12,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The food was more than delicious !!! Try the soup it's awesome !!! And the Thai iced tea was to die for ! The main course was very tasty and the manager was very helpful!!! He offered more rice or more drinks whenever he noticed we were ‚Ä¶
13,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing restaurant, hidden gem of the canals of Amsterdam. You won't find a better authentic Thai in the Netherlands. I've lived in Thailand for half a decade which means I'm quite familiar with the local flavours, the food tastes exactly ‚Ä¶"
14,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,a year ago,Friendly staff and great pad Thai
15,Kruabuppha, 4 stars ,2 years ago,An Asian family cooking authentic food! The pad Thai is out of this world! The red curry was very good although it was spicier than one chilli level!
16,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food, many vegetarian options. Great pad thai and red curry! Very friendly service. Nice table outside, by the Street."
17,Kruabuppha, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very good local Thai restaurant. I liked the comfy service and flavorful food. You can ask them to spice it up more since it's not straight out of Isaan.
18,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent authentic Thai food with really rich flavours. One of the best, if not the best I've had in Amsterdam: Lovely staff and fast service too."
19,Kruabuppha, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Ordered the green curry and chicken fried rice, both were good, but I found the chicken fried rice to be very nice and extremely flavourful. ‚Ä¶"

24,Kruabuppha, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was very slow even though we arrived at 6pm when there was no one else yet. (It seemed like they were busy with take-away orders) Food was ok, we came with high expectation but it was nothing amazing. The staff was friendly though."
