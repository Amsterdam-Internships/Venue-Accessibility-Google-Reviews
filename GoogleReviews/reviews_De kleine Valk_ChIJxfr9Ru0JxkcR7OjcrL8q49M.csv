0,De kleine Valk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Honestly better than I originally thought it would be. Priced rather okay ish, some things were rather expensive. The drinks menu didn't have pricing so it was just guess work really and the men's toilet the sink was broken...."
1,De kleine Valk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for Latin music and dance. The copacabana event organised here is particularly good - nice ambience and dj.
2,De kleine Valk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful place, brilliant service, i would visit again, loved it"
3,De kleine Valk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best pizza I ever eaten over a great view of the harbor, 5 out of 5 easy!"
4,De kleine Valk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice interior with good food for a decent price at a very nice location. We celebrated our son's birthday there, they have a separate room for kids to play, with toys, houses and attractions. The staff were very friendly and the service was very good, very nice experience in total!"
5,De kleine Valk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was good, but the food was terrible. We ordered tuna sashimi, instead we got tuna tataki. It is not a problem, since it could be a nice dish, but you could taste that it was frozen and not fresh. Wouldn't recommend eating here."
6,De kleine Valk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It’s my first time in The Netherlands and a friend of mine brought me to The Balk Hotel Heerlen, and let me say that: this Hotel and Restaurant is off the hook, looks expensive but is not is pretty affordable. They have a pool, with a …"
7,De kleine Valk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We had a quick light lunch here and really enjoyed. Perfect summer weather when we visited so we sat outside creating a lovely atmosphere. Service was fast and the staff smiling and helpful. Highly recommended visiting especially in summer.
8,De kleine Valk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The food and service was terrible. I ordered duck spring rolls with hoisin sauce and got them with a mustard-type sauce, yellow and creamy. When I said something about this they insisted it was hoisin. I sent it back but they charged for it …"
9,De kleine Valk, 1 star ,3 years ago,Very bad service. When we asked for the third round of drinks the waiter got mad because “it’s not my job to come back to your table for orders” (but in the meantime they refused to let us order at the bar because they want table service). …
10,De kleine Valk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Poor service, overpriced, and low quality food. Very rude staff. Waiter ""threw"" food on our table even on a day which was relatively quite and there were not so many people."
11,De kleine Valk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The waiters were very unorganized and we waited over an hour for our food. We watched as people had to get up and find the waiter to ask for their food, bill, etc. I will not be returning and would highly discourage people to go here."
12,De kleine Valk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Overall a pleasant experience. Burger wasn't too great but highly recommend the meat spring rolls. Good ambience. Would go back.
13,De kleine Valk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Unfriendly and pushy staff. Food was okay but overpriced. Would not recommend.

16,De kleine Valk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Two of the orders were bungled multiple times by the cook, behind the curtains, so to speak. This doesn't inspire anything but a bad review. The food was OK+. Normally I go out of my way to tip well, not yesterday!"

21,De kleine Valk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really cosy and chilled. Valkburger with sweet potato fries and truffle mayo was really nice. Very good price for the food you got too.
22,De kleine Valk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place, it has a playground for children’s. Also a kid menu. I think the only negative is the menu is not so good for adults."
