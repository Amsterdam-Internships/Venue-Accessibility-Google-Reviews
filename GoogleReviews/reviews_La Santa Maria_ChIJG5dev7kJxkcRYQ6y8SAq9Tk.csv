0,La Santa Maria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Went there couple of days prior to 2018 new year. Delicious food with great hospitality. I don't remember food name but it was 'pescado'. Save some money to reward yourself once with drooling servings.
1,La Santa Maria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good place to eat. Very nice and clean restaurant in the red light district area.
2,La Santa Maria, 5 stars ,a month ago,"The food is good, but what makes the difference is the service... amazing !!!"
3,La Santa Maria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We happened upon this restaurant as we were walking about the neighborhood near our hotel and were most pleasantly surprised! The entrees were each excellent and our desserts were delicious‚ÄºÔ∏è
4,La Santa Maria, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The manager was a sweetheart, delicious grilles chicken highly recommend"
5,La Santa Maria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious pasta, decent portion and great prices. The staff are friendly as well."
6,La Santa Maria, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Brilliant hosting- great meal and best view of Amsterdam strollers outsideüòÉ
7,La Santa Maria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The starters were a bit lacking, but the main dish was great. Loved the veggies to my perfect medium rare steak! Definitely worth it. The bottled beer I find overpriced (5 Euro for a Corona or any other of the choices.) If you like Heineken, then it's alright. I think Heineken cost a bit over 3 Euro."
8,La Santa Maria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing quality steak and masses of it! Nice to see salad and chips included too. Good wine selection. Friendly waiter. ‚Ä¶
9,La Santa Maria, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Squid was bad, meat had no flavour and waiting times too long"
10,La Santa Maria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a really nice steak , cooked to the way I like it. Nice cosy atmosphere."
11,La Santa Maria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Was here on Monday afternoon and there was not a soul. But Zeedijk Street is certainly a quiet street although right at the centte. ‚Ä¶
12,La Santa Maria, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Staff is super kind, service is fast, atmosphere is nice. They have a lot of mexican food, but the taste of them is under average. Half part of Rib eye steak was rough, chewy - I couln't eat it. :-("
13,La Santa Maria, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I had a medium rare steak. It was dry, overcooked and not taste good. They didn‚Äôt serve tap water and so had to purchase bottle water. Service was nice though"
14,La Santa Maria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice place, bit out of the way. Waiter was spot on. Food was great although the German (?) Meatballs were still frozen in the middle on one of the orders. Rest of the meal was perfect though"
15,La Santa Maria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty food. 3 of us ordered different dishes and we all liked it. Very cosy,calm and quiet. Really loved the place, food and atmosphere."
16,La Santa Maria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere, awesome food, great experience.  Everytime I have visited from California, I eat here.  Best steaks in Amsterdam, and the salmon looks, smell and tastes heavenly."
17,La Santa Maria, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice kind service, ok food. Not the best steak in town, but a serviceable dinner. I live in the neighbourhood and have better options within a few hundred meters."
18,La Santa Maria, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Ordered a beef burger and it came out still very much raw in the middle. I asked them to cook it more, which they did on the outside, but the burger was still red on the inside when they gave it back. Burgers are made from mince meat and should not be given unless fully cooked for danger of food poisoning."
19,La Santa Maria, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Best place must eat there!!!! :)

26,La Santa Maria, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Mushroom soup is cold and I believe is from the instant powder, cabonara taste is bland, steak is tough and tasteless, vegetable soup taste exactly from seasoning powder......."
