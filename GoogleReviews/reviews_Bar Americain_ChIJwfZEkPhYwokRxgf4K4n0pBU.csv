2,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I went here for my birthday recrntly. I have been wanting to go here for years and finally made it though apparently the restaurant is closing soon. For appetizers I had the deviled eggs with pickled shrimp remoulade and gulf shrimp & …
3,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"It was hit or miss. I took my parents there after several great experiences. The service was excellent as I remembered it but when it came to the food, some dishes like the onion soup and salmon were amazing, but they did burn the steaks …"
4,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,4 years ago,This place fell a little flat for me. I had very high expectations because of Bobby Flay. I ordered the seafood sampler which was amazing but then I also ordered the philly steak and I requested it to be medium rare but ended up coming out …
5,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Bobby Flay has created a better hot brown than the originator, The Brown Hotel. Don't forget to order the awesome fries!"
6,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The food was wonderful. We loved the shrimp deviled egg app and all of our entrees were scrumptious. Thank you!

8,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Food is amazing. The shellfish selection platter is just sublime! The NY strip steak medium rate was one of the best I have ever had. Ambience is nice. Waiter was great. Overall a fantastic experience! Would certainly recommend!
9,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good service and good flavorful food. The decor is very mid-century modern hotel, lots of earth tones and interesting lights and shades. The staff were friendly and accommodating. We had the delicious deviled egg (served with shrimp!), the …"
10,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"This place was surprisingly, just okay.  The decor and the ambience inspired a sense of high class; befitting the area this place is situated in. The service was pretty good, just pretty good and so was the food.  That was the most …"
11,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,7 years ago,My friend and I enjoyed a lovely evening at Bar Americain. Never felt rushed.  Service was wonderful.  Our waitress was personable and friendly - made us feel special since we were visiting from out-of-town.  We enjoyed three appetizers and salads and all the dishes were flavorful and unique.  Would definitely go back.
12,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Went to this restaurant the evening of March 1, 2014 while visiting the Big Apple. The atmosphere was wonderful. The staff EXCEEDED expectations. Very friendly and welcoming. The food, well, exceptional. My son and I posted every artfully …"
13,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,8 years ago,Went on a busy Saturday night this summer. The ambiance is very cool and metropolitan. Service was amazing. There were so many servers and runners that our drinks were never low and our dishes were cleared as soon as we were finished with …
14,Bar Americain, 1 star ,6 years ago,The food was gross I was expecting amazing for the price of the food when my food came out I ended up with hair in my salmon and still had to pay full price for it even though it had hair in it. Also my husband's steak was not medium it was …
15,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The service staff was attentive granted I was there with literally only 6 other individuals with a seating capacity of probably 150+.  Everything inside was fantastically artful, however tables were so small, and the line staff brought food …"
16,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We come here when we visit NYC and the food is usually delicious and great service but the last visit the waiter James needs training on how to serve and needs customer service skills. The seafood trio appetizer is pricey but so delicious, …"
17,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is one of my favorite spots - it always has something tasty for everyone and the service and quality are consistently great. If you're vegetarian, there is usually a good menu option or two, but you can also ask them for any off-menu …"
18,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place was amazing- we were looking for a place for brunch for our friend's bachelorette when another place didn't work out the night before with no luck when my sister stumbled upon Bar Americain close by. She conveniently booked our …
19,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Bobby Flay' s joint is awesome. Prices are very reasonable for Manhattan. The bourbon selection is most excellent, better than a few other places that brag about their bourbon selection. …"
20,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"The quality of service, attention to detail, decor, and food is all impeccable and well manicured, just very business lunch clinical. With a small menu, focused largely on impressing with the raw bar, I wouldn't come here for the food even …"
21,Bar Americain, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food here is okay. Came here for lunch on a Friday. French onion soup is cheesy and hearty. Deviled eggs were flavorful. The Burger Americain was overly salty. Deep dish chocolate creme pie was not too sweet and a very good dessert.
22,Bar Americain, 2 stars ,5 years ago,I probably went on an off night.  First the service.  It was excellent and our waiter was helpful friendly and great.  Sommelier was furst class. Ambiance was nice but been there done that. Nothing unique. Now let's get to the food.  I …
23,Bar Americain, 2 stars ,4 years ago,I went there on a trip to NY for my birthday. My friend and I ordered the fried chicken that comes with a breast and a drumstick with a side of greens. I also order a side of the smashed potatoes. When we received our food it looked very …
24,Bar Americain, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The service was good but sadly the meal was botched. My dad and I both ordered Filet Mignons. I ordered mine medium and my dad ordered his well done. They butterfly cut his and it was super burnt. …
25,Bar Americain, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Being a big fan of Bobby Flay, I was really excited to eat here. It was beautiful when I walked in and my server was very professional. For appetizers at $25 and entrees starting at $40, the food was of very poor quality. My chicken had …"
26,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,5 years ago,This place was great. Both the service and the food were very good. The hot chips with blue cheese are awesome. We had also the Lamb and fried chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection. Prices reflect the quality of the food. Definitely a place to revisit
27,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Steak tartar was excellent. Chicken cobb was delicious. Lobster roll has changed flavor. A little over dressed and salty. Lupita, our server, was amazing, attentive and fun.  Profiteroles ended our lunch on just the right sweet note!!"
28,Bar Americain, 2 stars ,6 years ago,Disappointing. My husband and I am a huge fan of Bobby Flay and his restaurant Mesa Grill. We have been to his other New York restaurant over the past ten years and have always enjoyed the experience of the food. The quality has always been …
29,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Seemed popular with the suited, male, business lunch crowd. I sat at the bar, nice bartender, attentive service. The caesar salad and onion soup were fine but the bread was amazing. Would definitely go back for a business or solo lunch but not a casual lunch with friends during the week."
30,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Hanger steak, creamed corn and steak sauce were very tasty.  Solid meal with prices that reflect the celebrity chef. I'd visit again, but the restaurant would not be my first choice given NYC dining choices."
31,Bar Americain, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Had been waiting for this evening for a while. Made 6 o'clock reservation for 4, had theater tickets at 8. We told them that when we sat down and again when the waiter came she asked if we were going to the theater. We ordered drinks and …"
32,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"This is now on our must-revisit list.

Mussels were perfect, various chicken dinners were filling and hit the spot. …"
33,Bar Americain, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"I am a fan of Bobby Flay's work on the Food Network and was excited to try one of his NY restaurants.  But frankly, I was mostly disappointed with the quality of the cocktails and food.  My steak had a nice crust on it, but otherwise my …"
34,Bar Americain, 1 star ,4 years ago,Service was great. Chopped salad tasted like they were adding salt and the top came off the salt shaker. Sent it back for pumpkin soup which had good texture and pumpkin taste but way too much sugar. Almost syrupy. Maybe the worst salad and …
35,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,6 years ago,My boyfriend and I stayed the night in the casino for our anniversary and ate at this restaurant. The food was amazing. As a huge Bobby Flay fan I had noting but high hopes for flavor in my food. I wasn't disappointed. The hostess asked us …
36,Bar Americain, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We had lunch there on Saturday afternoon.  We were seated at wobbly table and had to literally ask the server to adjust after the water glasses were rattling and splashing on to the table.  The server was quite pleasant but, it took 22 …"
37,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Disappointing.

Nice bartender, decent waiter, but it stops there. Had tuna tartare for an …"
38,Bar Americain, 1 star ,4 years ago,"So disappointed. I love Bobby Flay, this was our first Flay restaurant and I had nothing that was worth while. I got French onion soup, no body, just sweet with no depth, not even served hot. My husband got the blue cheese dip chips (this …"
39,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"My Mom’s favorite! Go for brunch, the gratis bread basket is absolutely excellent. It features several different assortments of bread and is plentiful! Also the coconut crab ceviche is excellent, that is something you should most certainly try!"
40,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"I've been here a few times, and it is a reliable spot for a meal midtown that's not overly expensive or a less-than-desirable chain restaurant. Bobby Flay's menu of upscale but comfortable food is easy to order from, almost always find …"
41,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was of course great,  atmosphere just what you would expect from an upscale restaurant.
Service was horrible.  We we're visiting New York City and wanted to try Bobby …"
42,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went here a couple years ago and had the best steak of our lives. Also tried a whiskey smash for the first time, it was great. The bar tender was very nice, wish i could remember her name."
43,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Food, as usual, was very good.  Staff was so so this time.  I despise when servers holler out the food to figure out who ordered it.  Please, Bar Americain, you can and should do better.  We were a table of 8 and just 2 had desserts.  The servers couldn't remember/didn't care enough to know who had 2 desserts."
44,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,15 years ago,"an intriguing menu with so many interesting choices.appetizers: the shrimp with grits was excellent, and the johnny cake w/ duck was very good though i felt the flavors all blended together into a curry like taste. entrees: the red snapper …"
45,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"There was nothing wrong with the dishes,  but the dishes didn't impress me.  I had pork lamb with quinoa. The quinoa was dry. The lamb was the star and cooked excellent. I tasted the fried chicken and greens. The chicken was very good but …"
46,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The service was great, everybody was very kind. We were able to get a table immediately on a Friday night.
The food was good, but not amazing. The steaks were a bit inconsistent which was disappointing but they were still tasty."
47,Bar Americain, 1 star ,4 years ago,Our Waitress was extremely rude considering it was her mistakes that ruined our dinning experience.  First mistake was never bringing the butter knife one lady requested. Second mistake was not asking two of the ladies what appetizers they …
48,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Bobby Flay is a great chef.  Mostly good meals. Our most recent dining experience was for a holiday.  The BBQ Prime Rib was a huge failure.  Stick to the normal fare and you will eat like a winner.
49,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,12 years ago,"great!!! bobby flay out did himself. the food is always gourmet from soup to dessert. best lamb chops i ever had. fabulous bar. the decor is part of the dining experience. you will love it, treat yourself."
50,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"the food is exceptional, though you pay for it.  better on expense account (do those even exist any more?  The tables are ""crowdy"" which makes conversation difficult.  The wait staff are generally very knowledgeable about the southwestern menu items, which are somewhat unfamiliar here in NYC to say the least."
51,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Bae Americain never disappoints. It's near the office in Manhattan, so I always make it a point to go when I am in town visiting. I've gotten the pork and lamb chops. While both are great, I'd probably lean toward the pork chop. Always get …"
52,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great staff and delicious food. Very open and nice restaurant. We were still waiting for the rest of our party and the servers were happy to serve us our drinks without eating. Took an hour for the rest to show up and there was no rushing to order food.
53,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The restaurant was beautiful, the service was excellent, the food was disappointing. I had shrimp and grits as an appetizer. Being from the south, I had high expectations. They were below average. You don't get a second chance to make a good first impression unfortunately."
54,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Absolutely amazing! We are in town visiting from California for our wedding so we had to go to a Bobby restaurant while we were here! The waitstaff was outstanding and the food was absolutely phenomenal. The only way this would have been better is if Bobby was there! OPEN A RESTAURANT IN CALIFORNIA!!!
55,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Service was excellent. My wife and I told the waitress we wanted to take our time and enjoy drinks apps etc.  She was very accommodating.  I asked for some recommendations and she was quick to suggest the duck confit and said the bourbon …
56,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"We had a nice Valentine's Day experience.  Very warm service from the hostesses to the wait person, to bus staff.  The food was excellent, but when one item was too rich for my wife's taste the waitress gladly replaced it with another selection."
57,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Food was great. My wife's filet had to be re-fired twice because it was raw so she ate all by herself...on our anniversary. Expect better execution from such a highly rated restaurant.
58,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,5 years ago,This review is for the bar. It doesn't have a large beer menu (as the Google review says). The cocktail list is small and not complicated (for $15-$16). Both the Martini and the Old Fashioned tasted watered down. Wine list is large though.
59,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,9 years ago,One of the best business lunch places in the area. The food is great and it has a good selection when you have a mixed group. I had the soft shell crabs and loved them. There was also a gumbo that seemed good.
60,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Bobby Flay serves up delicious, elevated plates. Steaks are superb. Large selection of seafood. Entrees and appetizers are uniquely high-end yet affordable. Great for special dates."
61,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,10 years ago,"I've dined here twice, both for lunch and really liked the food. After having the original Hot Brown sandwich in Kentucky, I had to try Flay's and it was DELICIOUS. …"
62,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"Good choice of classic cocktails.  Try the sazerac.  The french onion soup is very good, and large enough to be a meal replacement.  Mini-cornbread from the breadbasket is awesome.  Atmosphere is upscale dining, though it felt overpriced compared to competition."
63,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"I LOVED Bar Americain.  We had a private event here and I was just blown away by the food.  Passed appetizers included beef tartare, mushroom puffs, and chicken skewers, among others.  The meal included three courses-- …"
64,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Every dish is great. The ceviche trio is stellar. The burger is amazing. The shrimp and grits is ridiculous. This is my goto spot before a show. …
65,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"I went to New York for a short visit with some friends, I told my friends I would like to eat at Bobby Flay's restaurant, so we went to Bar Americain on our first night. I had the Vidalia Onion soup, Wild mushroom, butternut squash crepes …"
66,Bar Americain, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Lamb dish was pretty bad.  Looked like an appetizer, 4 small pieces of lamb size of my thumb, and I have small hands, for $42, really!
Lamb was cold, supposed to come with carrots, couldn't find any in my quinoa …"
67,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Seriously a great experience. If you're a foodie this is the place to go. I must admit I'm biased because I'm a huge fan of Bobby Flay's but this is definitely not to be missed. I started with the tuna tartare had duck confit for my main …
68,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Bobby Flay knows how to please!  Food is creative and perfect to every last detail!  Decor is so NYC, fun yet classy!  The service is impeccable!  The food is pure art that you want to take a photo of before you feast on it!  Everything …"
69,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,9 years ago,I had high hopes for Bar Americain. I walked in and took a seat at the bar. My server brought me a menu for drinks and I ordered a Manhattan. Impressively the bar tender knew enough to ask if I prefer lemon twist or cherry with my drink. …
70,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"very pleasant staff and ambience
convenient to Broadway shows
Food fair at best …"
71,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,8 years ago,I am a native New Yorker and will keep to the directness of how we are known to be :) …
72,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Steaks were perfectly cooked and high quality.  Sides were good, particularly cauliflower and mashed potatoes.  Asparagus was solid, but nothing special. …"
73,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"My suggestion is to skip the table and grab a seat at the bar. The appetizers  and the entrees were great. My wife and I wanted a ""New York"" night out and this hit the mark. about $125 for two with drinks. Dont skip the Shrimp & grits or the Pork Chops."
74,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Really liked the ambiance. Went for drinks and dessert. Looking forward to having their lobster someday. The creme brulee was encrusted with pecans and not thick or crisp enough.
75,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We had such a delightful meal here.   I came with a group of friends, hosting someone from out of town.  There is no finer example of good cuisine, unpretentious service and a lively energy in the city."
76,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Food Network star chef Bobby Flay (Mesa Grill) created a loud American expense-account brasserie in a soaring bi-level space designed by David Rockwell with a zinc bar, massive mirrors and a caring, black-aproned waitstaff. The Iron Chef …"
77,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,4 years ago,It's a nice stop before going to a show. Prices are on the high end but that's expected due to the location and being owned by Chef Flat.  The staff was helpful with recommendations. Would definitely come back if I was in the area.
78,Bar Americain, 1 star ,4 years ago,"My wife has been a chef for well over 30 years and she had been wanting to go to this restaurant for a while now.  Well, we were finally in New York and we specifically did not eat on that day so we could enjoy a quality lunch on an empty …"
79,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,12 years ago,"excellent french onion soup (second best in the city, balthazar has the best), mussels better than markt, and possibly the best home made potato chips in the city.  the room is gorgeous and noisy, but not quite as noisy near the raw bar at the back."
80,Bar Americain, 1 star ,4 years ago,I am a big Bobby Flay fan and when we travel to a location where he has a restaurant we make an effort to go. Straight of the plane we went to Bar Americana and were very disappointed. Service was bad and food actually came out cold. I really couldn't believe it. Complete let down.
81,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Tremendous service. Good atmosphere. Decent menu but the food is excellent. Reco NY strip with tuna tartare app, side of chips with blue cheese and asparagus. Terrific."
82,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,12 years ago,"i love you, bobby. but after eating those heavenly home made chips with blue cheese dipping sauce, i was ready to go to the cardiac care ward.  food is great and this place is fun and unpretentious."
83,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Came here for some pre-show drinks and appetizers, and left very satisfied! We tried the seafood cocktail sampler and all three items were very good."
84,Bar Americain, 1 star ,8 years ago,"Awful service, overpriced food, poorly presented, no options for vegetarians. This is one of the most overrated restaurants I have ever dined in. Living on Bobby Flay's reputation-- the place was empty by 9:30."
85,Bar Americain, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Beautiful venue&staff.  Disappointed in shrimp/grits.grits skim layer did not leave much grits when removed...maybe expected too much being from seafood state.  Duck was awesome.
86,Bar Americain, 1 star ,4 years ago,"This was legitimate let down.  The waiter didn't know what came in a Cobb salad, the sauces were so spicy that you couldn't taste anything else and the burgers were no better than a Ruby Tuesday's...not what I would expect from an Iron Chef!"
87,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We sat at the bar...excellent service; friendly bartenders...the Shrimp & Grits was the best I've ever had!  My friends had the Spicy Tuna Tartare....which they loved.  Great food, great prices, great staff!"
88,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,12 years ago,"price is average of lunch for each of three people. each dish was perfection:snapper, butterfish(divine) and clam chowder--most unusual and memorable.pricey and i would hesitate going for dinner with drinks etc."
89,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I went with my family, I thought it was good.
My Wife and Son Loved it. With that said it's expensive but you get what you pay for. …"
90,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was amazing. Bobby Flay you are the man. Steak was perfect, the drinks were amazing, and the design was great. Check this place out."
91,Bar Americain, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Atmosphere is great, the food was disappointing.  My chicken was red in the center- inedible.  The only thing served hot was the dip"
92,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Best filet I've ever had!
93,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"We celebrated our daughters birthday at Brunch.Everything from the Hostess to the Wait Staff, to the fantastic food, was excellent.They even did a GREAT presentation for our daughters birthday desert.Thanks for a special experience."
94,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Expensive, but service & food worth the effort. Seated upstairs we had a great view of the activities down below. Can recommend the Pork Chop & Cedar Plank Salmon."
95,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,15 years ago,decor cold and noisy. steaks poorly prepared. rib eye steak thin and overcooked. filet mignon served butterflied and dry (not on the menu that way). no way to send either back and keep the pace of the evening with others. smartass waiters want to be cleve
96,Bar Americain, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"A great wide range of cuisine...Bobby Flay keeps the quality high and the prices damn near reasonable.  If you love seafood the raw bar is among the best,"
97,Bar Americain, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Very disappointed with the food. Chewy, cold, late. I booked a month in advance and it ruined my Christmas. I not only won't go back but also i would strongly encourage  you, my reader to choose another place"
98,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food and service.  The manager was over and above, they all took such great care. We went the day of the ""blizzard"" and it made our day.🌹"
99,Bar Americain, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I love this restaraunt! I work in midtown and come here frequently  for lunch.  My favroite is the pasta and the mimosa margarita yummy.

102,Bar Americain, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"Waiter disappeared, someone else took our order. Waited a significant amount of time between each course. Food was amazingly small portions and not great. Disappointing."
