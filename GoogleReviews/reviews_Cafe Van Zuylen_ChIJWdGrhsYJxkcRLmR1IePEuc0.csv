10,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Food was great. Very touristy and quite crowded. The service was great but sometimes took a little long.
11,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We've been a here for breakfast on a few occasions. It's not the largest of menu but we do enjoy the scrambled eggs, bacon and toast. It's always been good for us and I'm sure we'd return next time we visit Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"

13,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Really liked eating here with my two small children out on the bridge. The bitterballen, meatballs, and grolsch were all very tasty. Everything came out quickly and we were able to pay quickly."
14,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely cafe with tons of seating in a sunny spot on a bridge. Service was a bit slow outside because it was busy, but once we'd ordered the food and drink came quickly. I can recommended the Spanish platter - really big and full of the flavours of Spain"
15,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Heel gezellig plek! Wonderful place for lunch or just to have a drink later. In a great spot in Amsterdam that is a little off the normal beaten path.
16,Cafe Van Zuylen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We went there with high hopes, but were quickly disappointed. It took three staff 20 minutes to realize we were there, 15 to bring water and so on. The burger's meat whas very low quality and badly cooked. The rest of the food (sandwiches) seemed ok."
17,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is one of the nicest in the area. You have a view, you have good food, and also noce staff. Also the have this beautiful cat. Highly recommend this place. We ordered pasta and steak. All was super tasty. Also the staff helped us ‚Ä¶"
18,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"I like this pub, just I always got a bit tense as I am easy going and if staff were unreasonably short with me. I was not chatting them up or anything, just wanted to see when our snacks were coming after 45 minutes wait. Ah well, post pandemic life and everyone needs some getting used to."
19,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"for an ordinary Dutch lunch, this was a good place. Standard selection of sandwiches, paninis and ""goat cheese salad / smoked salmon salad"", standard prices, standard speed of service and level of politeness. a good average ‚Ä¶"
20,Cafe Van Zuylen, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Bad coffee, dirty toilet, Benedict eggs were too sour. Only the one thing was good -  cutie cat sleeping inside :)"
21,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice atmosphere and very efficient service made this a very pleasant visit. I had a steak and my wife had a pasta dish, both washed down with a few beers. Well worth a visit, especially if you can get to sit at a table on the bridge."
22,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been here a few times and it never disappoints. Really tasty Dutch food at very reasonable prices. Oh, and a very friendly cat."

29,Cafe Van Zuylen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Location is wicked - service is appalling ... Placed a simple nachos order - after 30min I followed up with the waitress who confirmed its on its way - at 45min she tells me it's not coming and that someone in the kitchen had cancelled it ... Hard to believe she still brought me my bill for my beer ü§™
30,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice cosy bar, fairly busy. Reasonable selection of beers and food is available as well...plus they have a cat."
31,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great cafe with a nice and big terrace

34,Cafe Van Zuylen, 1 star ,11 months ago,"Don't forget how this Caf√© recycled beers!!! They were caught in 2006 that they took undrunk halves and quarters of beers of customers that, mixed together and given to new customers. Yuck!!!! They were filmed doing that but it seems nothing distracted then from going on."
35,Cafe Van Zuylen, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Amsterdam price gouging at its worst. Banal food at outrageous prices. Indifferent non-service. ‚Ç¨9 for a sandwich. ‚Ç¨5 for olives. 30 minute wait for a tosti. Industrial dyed-brown bargain bread. Part of the order never arrived. Tip : for proper Italian sandwiches, try Caldi e Freddi around the corner. Literally a third of the price."
36,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good place! Beautiful view and tasty food!
37,Cafe Van Zuylen, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"My order took a long time to be served and my tuna salad was so delicious but served not in the best way. No wifi at the terrace.
The view from the terrace is really amazing"
38,Cafe Van Zuylen, 2 stars ,10 months ago,Great location that‚Äôs close to home but disappointing food and service. We ordered food and drinks but one of the sandwiches did not arrive and the fries were cold. I asked for the sandwich to be removed from the bill but later realised that it wasn‚Äôt removed. Would not return.
39,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Gezellig place to hang out with friends having a chat with bites and drinks, plus the staffs are friendly!"

41,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It is a really good option for a sunny day! Even it was really busy, I found a table on the bridge, and the waitress came over less than 3 minutes to bring the menu and take our order. I ve ordered a pint of Grolsch (‚Ç¨6) and a portion of ‚Ä¶"

46,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing how this place feels like a local bar, where you can sit and enjoy a coffee or drink with a friend when it's so close to the centre of Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
47,Cafe Van Zuylen, 1 star ,9 months ago,"I dont suggest to try the vegan burger, just tastes like frying oil, same as the fries.
Service was not great and very slow, and the toilets very dirty"
48,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Just home from a 3 night trip to Amsterdam and Cafe Van Zuylen was perfect.  Stumbled upon it on the first night (literally) and stopped for a few drinks.  Visited every day/night after that.  Had lunch one day and dinner the next, with ‚Ä¶"
49,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It's a very nice pub were it's possible to drink a wide variety of beers. Inside it is not allowed to smoke but at the same time it's possibile to go and drink outside on the sidewalk therefore smoking both cigarettes and joints. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this wood bar which seems to be a mountain cabin.
50,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super cosy little local pub, with very friendly table service. I'd recommend a visit if you're after a decent beer or a bite to eat and need to take some shelter from the fiercely cold and strong Dutch wind! Very well places right next to the main canals and a nice variety of drinks and typical Dutch food."
51,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's alright. Very central location, perfect for people watching. Extremely Dutch crowd here, I'll let you figure if that's a good or bad thing. Mediocre coffee though, when it got to the table was almost cold already."
52,Cafe Van Zuylen, 1 star ,a year ago,"Very clumsy ! Waitress spilled a glass of beer on myself because of the wind, getting dirty my clothes very wet, dirty, sticky. Only a ""sorry"" was enough for her, not cleaning chairs and table, not offering anything to fix her mistake, so we left. Poor service."
53,Cafe Van Zuylen, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Extremely bad and slow service, left after 2 hour of waiting for eggs, the view is definitely not enough to compensate‚Ä¶"
54,Cafe Van Zuylen, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I have never experienced such a rude behaviour from staff at any place in my entire life. I put my stuff at one table and was deciding what to order. The waitress forced herself to ""my"" table joining it with the neighbouring one as a group ‚Ä¶"
55,Cafe Van Zuylen, 1 star ,5 years ago,"My wife and I walked around looking for a place by the canal to have a evening meal and some drinks.

57,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place on the canal, seating outside and a lots of seating inside."
58,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Love this spot to grab a drink with friends. The terrace is massive relative to other places in the city centre. If you're lucky to find a spot on a sunny day, kickback and enjoy people/boat watching on a picturesque canal.
Note: I have not eaten here."
59,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect! Great location on Canal! One of our favourites to go for a drink outside, excellent aperol spritz and the inside is cozy as well with candles at tables in evening. The drinks are great, vegan bitterballen are fabulous, you must try these they are that good!"
60,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Would be 5 stars if service was better but it's part doe the course in Amsterdam.  We hung out here for lunch drinks while waiting for a Cheese tasting across the street.  Very laid back atmosphere and wide variety of food and drink options.
61,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We came on a sunny hot Saturday and the Terrace section was overcrowded.
Even though it was so full the ladies of the service crew were always kind, patient and dull devoted to their jobs.
Thumbs up for the whole crew!"
62,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"First time in Amsterdam, and Cafe Van Zuylen was our first meal. All of the staff were very nice. Came in around 3pm, so they were only serving lunch snacks at the time, so we had a meat board and a cheese board and a couple of beers. Good ‚Ä¶"
63,Cafe Van Zuylen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Van Zuylen has a very nice terrace on the bridge over the Singel canal. Service also quite friendly and reasonably quick even on a busy sunny day. However the price of small basket of fried snacks was exorbitant at 14 euros!
64,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Caf√© van Zuylen is a quaint caf√© in Amsterdan which offers a treat. The sandwiches were well made, the salad superb. There is seating outside, so if it's not too busy or too hot, that is a nice oppurtunity. Normally I would not comment on a ‚Ä¶"

67,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Caught a great weather in may, 2016, so I stopped by the terrace of Van Zuylen, which was right on a bridge from a canal. The taste of food was really really awesome: pastas with smoked salmon and squid in crust (as in onion rings). The ‚Ä¶"

69,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I always bring friends here because there aren't too many bars that can accomodate large grouos- it's great all year round; very cosy in winter or lovely to sit outside in the summertime. I haven't had a meal here, but the beer and bitterballen are delicious!"
70,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,a year ago,Always busy with a nice cafe and cat.
71,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Just stopped for a couple of beers. Lovely for sitting outside of during the evening. A little under staffed for the area they cover, so service was a little slow. Either way, a nice place to visit."

Service was slow but understandable as the place was packed."
76,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Service is great! Sitting outside having a coffee reading or writing is perfect in spring (and must even better in summer). Price is a bit high though (a flat white is 2.8‚Ç¨)

80,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Outside sittig area is very cool with a view of the river. I cannot comment on interior. Enjoyed a couple beers. Waitreses are cute and smiling all the time. What else can u look for in a place like this?
81,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"There lives a lovely pub cat in this cafe.
The service isn't always too great, but it's a very nice setting. Cosy, and perfect for a nice beer and some bitterballen or a coffee with a friend."
82,Cafe Van Zuylen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good centrally located authentic Amsterdam bar to meet up with friends. Not a tourist trap. Great terrace seats on a historic bridge over the canal.
83,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Cool restaurant and place to have some drinks. I seen some nights where this place is busy packed and some evenings with its pretty slow and chilled. Each time is always a good one. Can't go wrong.
84,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Smack in the middle of central Amsterdam, by the canals, within a comfortable walking distance from Amsterdam Centraal. Come spring and summer time, it's a lovely place to lap some evening sun. The outdoor seating is a little bit cramped, causing outdoor table service to take a little longer."
85,Cafe Van Zuylen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We didn't eat here but we had a few drinks.  Table service was very good with very helpful staff, drinks were faultless and a great atmosphere."

Very unpleasant and arrogant waitresses. We won't go back !"
