0,Fiko, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Went here a while ago. Amazing pizza! Not your ordinary pizza joint, and Almost fine-dining experience. ‚Ä¶"
1,Fiko, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice traditional Italian cuisine.
Ordered meat balls, pasta, and pizza margherita.
I strongly recommend the pizza, the dough is crispy and freshly made."
2,Fiko, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Loved this place! One of the best restaurants in Amsterdam, we discovered it on our last trip and went there several times during our stay. Great staff, very friendly and helpful and the decor is cool, especially the ‚ÄòWall of Fame‚Äô. Will definitely visit again when we go back!"
3,Fiko, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We‚Äôve discovered this place accidentally during our short business trip. It was probably the best Italian food that I‚Äôve ever tasted and we go to Italy on several occasions every year üò≥üôà. Bruschetta with artichoke spreading is amazing, and pizza is must try. But above all, service is great. Seamless and highly effective. Great job."
4,Fiko, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful atmosphere! Lovely interiors, it‚Äôs so cool to watch the pizza being made right there the whole evening! Food was very good - best Italian I‚Äôve had in Amsterdam! There were lots of options on the menu and the drinks were amazing! Especially for the price! It was a lovely evening, I highly recommend!"
5,Fiko, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good flavors, fresh and tasty, very nice dishes size.
Our experience was that there was not enough space on the table and between the tables. Our neighbors chairs were right touching ours. ‚Ä¶"
6,Fiko, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The service was great. Every waiter makes eye contact every time and makes sure you are satisfied. All of the dishes tasted perfect. Maybe a little small for what you pay, but worth it. We missed some fish in the Vongole pasta and without a ‚Ä¶"
7,Fiko, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"The food was very nice, stuff was very friendly. The only downside which unfortunately made an impression is that we came with 7 people and we were told that we cannot order a dish each of us ‚Äî otherwise the kitchen would not handle it. So ‚Ä¶"
8,Fiko, 2 stars ,10 months ago,"A little disappointed. The first time I ordered, the food was great. It was really one of the best Italian food I've had so far in the Netherlands. Since then, I order regularly at this restaurant, but the quality is more disappointing the ‚Ä¶"
9,Fiko, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice place to enjoy a pizza with friends : cosy ambience and trendy decoration.
You can have to 2 small pizzas instead of one big so that you can try different ‚Ä¶"
10,Fiko, 1 star ,a month ago,Was really looking forward to take my girlfriend here for valentines day so booked in advance. 6 days before the reservation they decide it‚Äôs okay to slap me with an e-mail saying minimum amount I have to spend is ‚Ç¨75 per person‚Ä¶. Ofcourse ‚Ä¶
11,Fiko, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow!! Just awesome!! This is place is wonderful and marvelous! It's a fancy restaurant but prices are reasonable! High quality regarding the food and the diversity of menus! Plus, waiters are super nice and friendly! You feel like home and ‚Ä¶"
12,Fiko, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good, but not really awesome. Definitely overpriced! Some of the stuff were polite, but some not (the waiter from Sicily doesn't have manners and communication tactics, especially the joke about vodka to the old lady was absolutely impropriety)."
13,Fiko, 3 stars ,a year ago,Good quality and packaging but I found that the size of the portion did not justify the cost (17.5 EUR + delivery fees = 22 EUR) and ended up being an underwhelming and disappointing experience üòî I would recommend adding a small side of ‚Ä¶
14,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I went with my parents and boyfriend. We were celebrating their 38-year anniversary. The whole team knew and they received us with complementary glasses of champagne. The food is amazing and the atmosphere very relaxed. After the meal we ‚Ä¶
15,Fiko, 1 star ,7 months ago,We had a reservation. After we put our order we waited a full hour for it to come. We ordered Angus steak but it was too dry. Then we ordered dessert and waited 45 minutes more. It's ridiculous to wait that long. Tiramisu was very ‚Ä¶
16,Fiko, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good experience at FIKO.
Dishes were well prepared and tasted good.
I think the salmon tartar could've been fresher. I recommend visitors to stick to vegetarian / meat dishes.
Will come back."
17,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Among the best pizza I've ever had.  Staff was super helpful in picking out a meal.  Went with a traditional margherita pizza.  Kitchen is fun to watch in action.  Everyone was super friendly.  Can't wait to come back.
18,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The service and food were beyond excellent! Went here once when I got to Amsterdam and one last time before leaving because this is definitely a place where you go to leave off on a good note! P.s I highly recommend ordering their pizza here, it is something special."
19,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The Parmigana di Melanzane , roast potatoos with rosemary, mixed salad and the choclate pistachio light cheesecake was so deliciousüòÉreally my fav!! A must eat place!!"
20,Fiko, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The pizza had a thin crust, which I really liked! When we asked whether they could make a ‚Äògrand dessert‚Äô for us, it was possible. Very nice. We enjoyed it!"
21,Fiko, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cozy restaurant in a good location. Loved the service and pizza. Recommended!
Prices are higher than usualy but worth the quality."
22,Fiko, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Tiny portions, expensive price, tiramisu was in a martini glass, staff overly friendly and intrusive. Do not recommend, way too expensive for what you're getting"
23,Fiko, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Best Italian Food in Amsterdam.
Kitchen from Puglia, staff and chef with best international experience.
I can def suggest it!"
24,Fiko, 1 star ,7 months ago,It was a very bad experience. We would never go again. We went as 4 friends and all of us ordered meat. We waited for 40 minutes and the plate was very weak. It had a few mushrooms and a small carrot and that was all. The portion compared ‚Ä¶
25,Fiko, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very authentic, very professional. Watching pizzaiolo work the dough was an entertainment by itself. Pizza was was extremely good, and photo doesn't give justice to how delicate and delicious is the Tiramis√π. Must go back to try their Primi."
26,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Arrived in Amsterdam later afternoon on a Monday. Asked suggestion where to eat at the hotel reception. Local Finko restaurant (Italian) was suggested and probably would not need a reservation. To our surprise at Finko they were fully ‚Ä¶
27,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing pizza, super friendly service, best cheesecake ever (nutella pistachio)."

29,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I would give it a 10/10 if i could! It is truly a perfect restaurant. The food is super delicious, the service is excellent, and the waiters/waitresses are very nice and respectful."
30,Fiko, 4 stars ,a year ago,The spicy Salami pizza is heaven. Don't waste your money on the white truffle with gold leaves on it. Waste of money
31,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had one of my favourite meals in Amsterdam at FIKO Oud-West. We had the Tartufiko pasta and the Fiko pizza and loved both of them. Great restaurant and friendly staff, however they were overly persistent which made it hard to enjoy the meal and experience as it seemed they were rushing us."
32,Fiko, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Appetizers and bread were really good, but the pasta was such a let down. Not sure if I will go back given the the expensive price doesn‚Äôt match the quality."
33,Fiko, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic food! You have chefs making pizza all fresh in front of you, a traditional oven for baking pizza, and chatty and fun staffs. Amazing night there!"
34,Fiko, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The pizza is superb. The dough is perfection! The topping are masterfully chosen. I had a pistachella, which was delicious! The only sores are the over-the-top little things:blasting music, tables quite close by, live presentation of ‚Ä¶"

45,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best pizza I have ever had my entire life, omg‚ù§‚ù§
You are as lucky as me to find Fiko by accident!"
46,Fiko, 2 stars ,a year ago,I‚Äôm conflicted on how I feel about this place. We placed an order in advance for takeaway on New Year‚Äôs Eve. The food wasn‚Äôt ready at given time which I guess is understandable given it was a busy evening for the staff. But when we actually ‚Ä¶

50,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Came here with my girlfriend. We had a great evening. The waitress explained the taste of the wine very well. My girlfriend couldn‚Äôt finish her food so she could take it with her. Great music, heard a lot of Tom Misch. Will definitely recommend to a critical pizza-lover."
51,Fiko, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best italian pizza in all Amsterdam. Proper
bufala mozzarella, good tomato sauce and good impasto. Truffle pizza and diavola are the best, get them both and share them! üòâ"
52,Fiko, 4 stars ,a year ago,"This place is fancy, starting from the ambiance to the service and for this...you of course pay accordingly. But the food is of the finest quality, fresh and genuine ingredients and there's a great attention to the detail. They offer ‚Ä¶"

56,Fiko, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was Amazing, and the look and feel of the restaurant is wonderful. We had a few starters to share and separate main courses. We finished the dinner with some delightful desserts. So over all, great food. But then, the service... not so ‚Ä¶"
57,Fiko, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best options for Italian food in Amsterdam. Seasoning and preparation were amazing in all dishes we have tried so far. The ""must try"" are the Fiko pizza and the Eggplant Parmigiana. Staff were nice, but sometimes a bit distracted."
58,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice and warm place. The food make me to trip on Italy. I am on Amsterdam 4 months now and it's the 1st time I eat something really good. The service is for 10 star and not for 5. They make feel like I am on home. Bravo!

60,Fiko, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great ambiance, great service and great food. The Tartufo pizza is a must try if you are a Truffle aficionado. The Tiramisu is quite nice for dessert. They also happen to have a good wine and spirits selection. Next time I plan on trying the Pizza with 23K gold flakes :D"
61,Fiko, 1 star ,2 years ago,Everything was fine until the main dishes came. The octopus was super salty. We sent it back to the Chef. They told us 5 people tried it and that it should be like that. They re-did the dish and even separated all the ingredients. But the ‚Ä¶
62,Fiko, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice, a romantic place with great food."
63,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing Italian experience. The food is really good and the pizza.... mama Mia! The diavolica one if I remember the name correct is probably the best pizza I have ever had. Cheesecake and tiramisu also top! ‚Ä¶
64,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Greeted on arrival with complimentary prosecco as we were celebrating an anniversary. The staff were very attentive and friendly which made us feel very welcomed.

65,Fiko, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The place was rammed for a Tuesday evening.  We hadn't booked but they had 2 seats at the bar which we accepted. ‚Ä¶
66,Fiko, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Even with low expectations the service was pretty awful. No one greeted me, so I sat myself, eventually flagged down a waiter for a menu, and again to order. Same story when it came to the check. The pizza itself came relatively quickly, ‚Ä¶"
67,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best pizza in Amsterdam! Excellent service! Love it!
68,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I booked on very short notice at Fiko to celebrate my anniversary with my boyfriend, I asked if they had a romantic table, but didn‚Äôt really expect them to have anything because I booked on the same day. When we arrived they organized a ‚Ä¶"
69,Fiko, 2 stars ,10 months ago,"Ordered gnochhi from here, which was only highly acidic tomato sauce and gnochhi, and no other flavours. Two stars for super quick delivery."
70,Fiko, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great Food ! Horrible service

Fico is one of the few real Italian places in Amsterdam that serves good quality ‚Ä¶"
71,Fiko, 1 star ,a year ago,Worst customer service. My pizza was ruined and called with Fiko to fix it. Laura the one on the phone promised me to deliver a fresh pizza. 45 min later still nothing and after calling 3 times they were closed. Never ordering or eating here again.
72,Fiko, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great, quality place with a partially open kitchen. The food was delicious, the service took a bit longer but it was worth it. This place is a bit expensive and more ‚Äòupscale‚Äô than we expected."

74,Fiko, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere, delicious (organic)wines and delicious food. We had a great valentines dinner here. The whole restaurant ceiling  was filled with balloons, looked great."
75,Fiko, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Mediocre is the right word. Hyped by influencers & bloggers. The food is good do not get me wrong but flat. There's no love so to say. ‚Ä¶
76,Fiko, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The main courses are overpriced yet are lacking both in terms of the portion size and taste.
Ordered grilled octopus and pasta with lobster, both were tiny and kinda so-so. ‚Ä¶"
77,Fiko, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was lovely, waiter was sometimes a bit awkward but I reckon he was new. However: learn the difference between vegetarian and vegan and don't try to tell me I'm vegan because I don't eat fish... A person in the food service industry should know better!"
78,Fiko, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Fresh products. Real Italian! Prices reasonable for what you get.
79,Fiko, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I ordered a pizza through a food delivery service and this is what arrived: totally inedible pizza. Most of it was just soggy bread, the toppings consisted of cherry tomatoes, rubbery cheese and tasteless pieces of sausage, most of which were on the cardboard anyways. Can't comment on the experience inside the restaurant."
80,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I really like it. the staff very helpful, the food super tasty and the atmosphere as well. I suggest to you the truffle pizza it was very delicious and protea salad."
81,Fiko, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, good food, top location. On the upscale side from a price perspective.
You can find the same quality food around Amsterdam for a little bit cheaper prices."
82,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely italian restaurant. Reasonable price considering quality of food. Small kitchen area on show where chefs make the pizzas. Would definitely go back again
83,Fiko, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Relatively new and definitely overhyped venue. It's 'just' an Italian restaurant, without any real food highlights, and with the typical Amsterdam staff (friendly until they get busy and then you're on your own), but with a nice mood and ‚Ä¶"
84,Fiko, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best pizza in Amsterdam. And i tried them all believe me. The team is super nice. Great idea of menu combining pizza and cocktail together. If i could eat there every day i would do it üíï

90,Fiko, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great pizzas and excellent service
91,Fiko, 3 stars ,4 years ago,After the media and social media hype I decided to go and try it out. As a starter we had burrata and parmigiano. The burrata itself was great but where were the tomato's and seasoning? 4 cherry tomatoes were really not in proportion with ‚Ä¶
92,Fiko, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"In my opinion is the best italian restaurant you can find in Amsterdam!! The location is modern and it is attended by young people.

93,Fiko, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved their pizza. Great taste. However, beware around closing time they will cancel your order - which I think is pretty lame."

95,Fiko, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good meal, but it does set the bar very high for any other Italian restaurant you'll visit.  Excellent execution produced an outstanding meal."
96,Fiko, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"1. Little space (that's ok for some people but I dont like it)
2. Good service, waitress was very attentive
