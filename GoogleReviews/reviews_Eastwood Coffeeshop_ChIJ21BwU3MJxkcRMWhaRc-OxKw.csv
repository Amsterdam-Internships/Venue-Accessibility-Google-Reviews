2,Eastwood Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Medium to good weed, prices are a bit over the top but not too crazy.

4,Eastwood Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Not the best weed as some may say. The space cookie is nice. The joints are thin and dry. Smoking room is boring. I'm not gonna name better shops but I don't plan to visit here again.
