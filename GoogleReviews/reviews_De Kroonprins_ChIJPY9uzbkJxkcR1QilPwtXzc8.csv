6,De Kroonprins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We were there for lunch on a damp and chilly day and the pea soup was a godsend.  The place is warm and welcoming.  The staff was very pleasant and offered suggestions and explanations as to how dishes were prepared.   Everything we had was ‚Ä¶

8,De Kroonprins, 3 stars ,2 years ago,It was... Fine. The soup and steak were a bit under spiced. The quality of the food was very average and the preparation mediocre. My medium steak was rather rare and not that high quality. ‚Ä¶
9,De Kroonprins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Got there just about 1230 and were served quickly. It was quiet but soon filled up as we were early for lunch. Olde world decor, snug and cosy for couples. Had a steak and chips for 15 euros. Nice and juicy. Great chips and peppercorn ‚Ä¶"
10,De Kroonprins, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The location of this restaurant is brilliant, just few steps from Amsterdam Central train station. We sat outside and enjoyed the views. Some of the dishes in their menus weren't available, I ordered half chicken and my wife got fried camembert cheese. The food was good but nothing special, the prices were average."
11,De Kroonprins, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The food was alright and reasonably priced. Wish I could say the same about the service. I went to this place because its so close to the central station and I had limited time before I had to catch a train. The waitress seemed very ‚Ä¶

13,De Kroonprins, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Service was slow and unfocused, food was average in best case. On the bill they charged the biggest meal, even if you had a small one. Seems like kitchen is not ready in afternoon hours, waiting time was nearly 1h."
14,De Kroonprins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cool bar to sit and enjoy yourself and all Amsterdam has to offer. Extremely friendly staff. Be careful stairs are tricky. As you can see in photos.
15,De Kroonprins, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food was ok. Except for the tomato soup! That was yummy. Service was a little lacking as we felt as if we were being ignored. People who ordered after us would get their food first.
16,De Kroonprins, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Good pub food with large portions.  The staff was busy but still able to be a little friendly.  Tour groups were also seated to early dinners.
17,De Kroonprins, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice, old and not that busy place - except its toilet - with fast service.The music CD is allways the same what the staff like much and singing together for.
It would be better with more main courses and less people who go to the toilet all the time from the street."
18,De Kroonprins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Ordered the Dutch steak special with salad and fries. Lovely tender and tasty steak.
19,De Kroonprins, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Nice bar for a drink or somehting to eat. It's nice to sit outside in the summer. Little pricey but that is Amsterdam.
