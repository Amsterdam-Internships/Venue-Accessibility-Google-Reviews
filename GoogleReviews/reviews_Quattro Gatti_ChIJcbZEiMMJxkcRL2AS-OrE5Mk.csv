17,Quattro Gatti, 1 star ,6 months ago,"We wanted to order coffee, but we were told that we can‚Äôt get any, since it‚Äôs dinner time and they are serving only dinner. Ok,  no problem. Asked if I could at least use the restroom and I was told no, since it‚Äôs only for the customers. How can I be a customer if they don‚Äôt want me to? No logic found."
18,Quattro Gatti, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"We have got different type of pastries and they were all amazing, we couldn‚Äôt stop eating them. We are Italians living in Amsterdam and we were looking for something typical and Quattro Gatti exceeded our expectations. We will order again very soon :)

34,Quattro Gatti, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Possibly the best Italian restaurant in Amsterdam! With ‚ÄúThere is no pizza inside‚Äù sign on its doors, it is a small, cosy place, and all food made by a single chef - Milos. If you come early, you could get a table without reservation. And the food is great!"

36,Quattro Gatti, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"To get pasta is very easy everywhere but it's very  hard to find traditional Italian flavor( if you have tried Italian food in Italy, you will know what I mean), so I think this is best pasta I have ever eaten in Netherlands so far.

42,Quattro Gatti, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Simply the best Piedmontese food of Netherland... The Chef is fantastic and does everything by himself. Yes sometimes you'll have to wait a bit but it's definitely worth it.
