1,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing location with seats in the sun, attentive staff and quick service.

We bought 2 latte for about 5 euro's. The foam was thick and could carry a spoon ‚Ä¶"
2,Lokaal Loosie, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Very rude staff! ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be here!‚Äù The guy refused to serve us at the bar and as we were waiting for a car pickup, the waitress came to turn off the heating lamp outside (the terrace was empty) ha ha ha! Too bad it‚Äôs a beautiful place and I‚Äôve had many lovely moments there in the past."
3,Lokaal Loosie, 1 star ,4 months ago,"The staff left us to stand in the doorway for ages while we waited to be QR scanned. The food is very limited (no fries ).. the burger bun was rock hard.
The waitress was wasn't friendly... serving us seemed a hassle for her."
4,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice bar, finger food options was good. Portion size and taste of the burger was suprisingly large and tasty. ‚Ä¶"

6,Lokaal Loosie, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Excellent table service- Parmezaaan ciabatta was really good!
7,Lokaal Loosie, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool, relaxed setting positioned in front of a market place on a Saturday, good atmosphere. Then we eventually got served... 'Pint' was 3/4 full. Toastie (chorizo & cheese) took 45 minutes to come out, was bone dry and very average. Think I could've rustled one up better at home."
8,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A well-rounded joint in the centre of Amsterdam. Great service, food well above average, good beer. What else can one ask for. I was glad to leave a tip (although not required in these lands). I would certainly recommend it and come back."
9,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Nice place to sit down with friends for some beers. I keep coming back for years. Even though it has a touristic location you will always find local at this place.
10,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the better bars in the very touristy area. They have good beers and it's indeed great people watching. Never eaten here, service can be a little slow but it's a really lovely old brown cafe"
11,Lokaal Loosie, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Outdoor seats are great. In-house seats were basically empty when I visited. Food and drinks were okay. Nothing much too exciting though. Good place for a momentary stop and rest.
12,Lokaal Loosie, 1 star ,4 months ago,"installed, order taken next to us and telling us then : we do not serve you saturated cuisine.
Avoid that place !"
13,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice laid back place. Great for watching life go by. A smart selection of drinks and value for money food. My personal fav. If I had to choose would be eggs from the oven. Their nacho platter feeds a table. Highly recommended.
14,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious breakfast with toast, scrambled eggs, ham, cheese and jam. Fresh pressed orange juice and a coffee of choice for a moderate price. Waitress was very mindful and friendly. We can recommend this place for a breakfast."

18,Lokaal Loosie, 1 star ,2 years ago,"A very poor experience here, we sat down, the waitress took our order for drinks as we were looking at the menu for food, she delivered our drinks and went away. ‚Ä¶"
19,Lokaal Loosie, 1 star ,3 years ago,Got handed the worst pint of my life in this bar....if you gave this to a person in ireland it would cause a riot. I poured it into the half pint glass beside it and it was actually less than half a pint
20,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent waiters and great choices of beer. This place has local beers brewed in Netherlands, craft beers. It has also other options of bottle beers from outside, such as belgium, Germany and UK. If you are nearby, come here, it's pleasant to stay here."

22,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A very nice bar just a cross the street of the metro station Nieuwmarkt . Drinks are fairly priced for the location, the staffs were all super friendly and nice. We spend the night drinking there, the interior on the inside seating is also looking really nice. What a great experience!!!"
23,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The bar/ restaurant is definitely a must have for any young human who visits Amsterdam. The flair is pretty alternative, kindoff rocky and quaintly. My friends and me were searching for a not too expensive but not too classy place to eat, ‚Ä¶"
24,Lokaal Loosie, 1 star ,2 years ago,I visited two countries while in Europe and this establishment was the only rude experience I had.  From the moment the waitress came out there was attitude from her.  I am a very friendly person and very respectful to others.  She was not ‚Ä¶
25,Lokaal Loosie, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst place I have ever visited.

26,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A fantastic recommendation from a local. It was very busy but worth the wait. I ordered for everyone, the chicken was so good we ordered more. The decor was relaxing and the staff were smart, polite and efficient.
Would definitely go back."
27,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Popped in for a cheeky drink before dinner and was met with friendly service and a great selection of drinks. Will definitely be coming back for some afternoon beers when its a bit warmer. 4.8 stars rounded up to 5 cause they serve Weihenstephan.
28,Lokaal Loosie, 4 stars ,3 years ago,'t Loosje is situated on the Nieuwmarkt in an old building. The rustic interior is authentic and has not changed much over the years.

33,Lokaal Loosie, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I hate to give one star as I feel it's rarely fair to owners. However, I faced real shady practices in this bar tonight: the owner refused to split our bill (50‚Ç¨+ bill) because ""it's too busy tonight we can't split bills"" then refused to produce an invoice for my company which I needed to reimburse this meal."
34,Lokaal Loosie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice and cool place. Had a really yummy grilled chicken wrap. Staff was ok, however the guys who served us gave us some tourist tips what to see around the city..."
35,Lokaal Loosie, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The staff here were incredibly rude to me and my friends as soon as we entered and continued to harass us until we left, telling us to go and drink on the street where it's illegal to carry open containers of alcohol. We're a query bunch so very odd and still not sure what we did!"
