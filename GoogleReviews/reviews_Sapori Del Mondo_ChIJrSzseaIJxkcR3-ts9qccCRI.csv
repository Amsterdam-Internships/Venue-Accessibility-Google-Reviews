1,Sapori Del Mondo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Bright and inviting interior. Service for the day we went was excellent, a recently transplanted Italian who was very solicitous.  The lunch menu is mostly sandwiches and paninis, but he specially made salads for us.  Excellent food, great service."
2,Sapori Del Mondo, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was pretty good. Staff was friendly. However one of our lasagnas was scorching hot, while another one was cold in the middle. Other than that, I really liked the ossobuco."
3,Sapori Del Mondo, 1 star ,4 years ago,used to be nice place with good lunch sandwiches and decent simple italian food in the evening. Now just after tourist money. Value for money is ridiculously low. Avoid at all costs!
