0,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Really great pizza. I had one without cheese and even that was good. Love it.
1,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The beauty is in its simplicity. A big, clean vibrant open kitchen with an intimate nook of a dining space overlooking it. ‚Ä¶"
2,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 4 stars ,a year ago,I haven‚Äôt dined in at this restaurant but the pizza delivered is really good. Nice thin crust with good char. The amount of toppings is perfect. The spicy salami is crispy and spicy. Very tasty pizza!
3,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"This is actually a 4-star review (I don't want to hurt the restaurant's average rating). I say 4 stars because despite offering great pizzes, with fine ingredients and wonderful crust, their tiramisu was bland and uninspiring. Yes, the ‚Ä¶"
4,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best pizza I have ever tried. The best I ate in the Netherlands for sure!
Super thin crust , delicious toppings, simple but rich in taste! Good service ‚Ä¶"
5,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The best margarita ever I had in Europe. Believe me.
6,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"I had the best margarita ever , the service was great the atmosphere is amazing by the waitress Jolina"
7,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the better pizzerias üçï in Amsterdam. Sympathetic pizzaiola from Sicily. Dough well made and 'swirled'. Very hot üî• oven, pizzas are ready in minutes. Thin crust, quality toppings. Does take-out and has a small seating area with 16 chairs. Does not take reservations. Recommended!"
8,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,a year ago,very good pizza with tasty dough. very friendly staff. Best pizza in this area. üòÑ
9,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 4 stars ,5 years ago,One of the best Pizza's in Amsterdam. The Prosciutto Pizza is almost as good as an Italian Pizza. The service is not great but still highly recommended.
10,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Had a horrible experience here and am extremely disappointed with the order (quality, service, temperature) and the unexpected long wait time. First, I ordered my food with the expectation that it would arrive within 60 minutes (per ‚Ä¶"
11,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best pizza in town!! Healthy.. tasty.. and the wine super nice...üòçüòç don't forget to try the antipasto üòçüòç
12,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Awful experience ordering from UberEats, pizza arrives 45 min late, cold. The size of the pizza was small for the price."
13,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of my best pizzas. Truffle pizza is the best!!!!!
14,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent authentic Italian pizza with great-tasting and natural ingredients. Top notch! üáÆüáπüçïüëåüîù
15,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great pizza and nice guys ruling it. Missing star because of overpricing and serving wine in a tiny glass.
16,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 1 star ,8 months ago,What asocial stuff. The picolini guys there was screaming on uber delivery. They have no way of talking like a strega ragazzi hahah. The picolino guy with long her very schifo faza one day he going to be very stronco hahahah... really che schifo... and they are also very dirty stuff don't forget that..
17,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 4 stars ,a year ago,"high prices unfortunately (one star off). the pizza‚Äôs are great, light on your stomach (thin), good quality, we tried almost all pizzerias in amsterdam and this may be the best"
18,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,a year ago,Tasty pizza for a decent price. They also deliver food.
19,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious, fresh ingredients, speedy and very friendly staff.
For an Italian, all Pizzas in Amsterdam are over priced but this one is worth it considering you will need to pay the same for any competing pizza of similar quality."
20,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Cosy environment and top class pizza!
21,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Simple, no fuss place with excellent pizza. The pizzas are wood fired and are the main item on the menu, some desserts as well but not much else. Wine is well-priced, beer options are not so great. No reservations so you may need to wait for a table, especially on weekends."
22,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Pizza was definitely delicious, but the prices are way to high. While the waiter was really kind and considerate, I consider 18‚Ç¨ for a pizza and a drink way too much. If it weren't for the prices, I'd recommend it. However, it might just be that some consider this being cheap. If you do, don't mind my review and go check it out."
23,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Authentic Italian pizza, for my opinion the best of Amsterdam! .. always very friendly and professional italian staff that use only fresh high quality ingredients. Sinds 1 year is also improved. Thanks for your nice smile ..l'm Italian as ‚Ä¶"
24,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place was great! When we went in the evening, we were the only two there for a time. We both ordered margherita pizzas which were made in a wood oven within our view. We also had a bottle of great red wine, and the prices were very ‚Ä¶"
25,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"1. the food : would say better then average, expect fresh, and quality Italian ingredients. ( but a pizza cost between 13 and 17 euro  ) they use a brick oven with wood as heating. ‚Ä¶"
26,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 1 star ,a year ago,"Ordered via Ubereats and it took 75 min to deliver, much longer than the advocated 30min. There are no more dine-in due to lockdown so they should be very free. Totally unacceptable to wait that long when you are spending more than 30 euros for pizza"
27,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best Italian pizza in Amsterdam, no doubt. Please burn it less if possible because we love it so much, we can't imagine to have to take a crumb out. The marinara is wonderful. And it is the way it should be."
28,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best pizza places in Amsterdam featuring  a proper food fired oven. Limited seating area but they do takeout. On busy days expect a little wait until you get your pizza but it's well worth it.
29,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Bad start as the waiter forgot my drink order, when I finally got it the glass was dirty. Food was good until i found a long black hair baked into my pizza so I sent it back and kindly refused their offer of free coffee and dessert. To top everything off I had to pay for the meal!"
30,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best Pizza of Amsterdam. Authentic Italian.
31,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 1 star ,2 years ago,The pizza delivered is among the worst I have ever seen/had. Ingredients and aspect are similar to what you can buy for 3Euro from AH - but I do trust that AH pizzas (even when taken from the freezer) are warmer that what you get on delivery. Horrible service with zero respect for your customers!
32,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I'm not sure if it's a joke or not that this place is called ""slow food"" on Google maps but our pizza came out super fast even though every table inside was taken. We had the calabrese pizza. The red wine was good too for being the only ‚Ä¶"
33,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 4 stars ,a year ago,It‚Äôs good but not great.  The meat : ham  tasted ok.
34,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great for takeaway pizzas when you call ahead to order. Sitting in the restaurant is a bit cramped and food can take a while to come out. Pizzas themselves are always very tasty and they have a nice variety of toppings.
35,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It a bit small space but it worth it, because pizza that I ordered was amazing. Also house wine is good, even though you do not get them in a wine glass. I recommend it. Go, try and enjoy!"
36,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Our favourite pizza place in Amsterdam. Take aways or sit in. Real Italians baking pizza in a wood oven. Can get hot inside on summer days. Why not 5 stars? Sometimes the quality is not the best.  But that does not happen a lot.
37,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 3 stars ,10 months ago,"It used to be one of my favorite places, but now almost always it is really too busy with online orders, so you can spend standing 10 min in front of them, and they wouldn‚Äôt even acknowledge. Pizza is good usually, service is pretty bad. Disappointed again."
38,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 1 star ,3 months ago,My pizza came much smaller than usually
39,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good pizza. Well priced and the food came quick. Only a small sit in area though, could get busy quite easily."
40,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 1 star ,3 years ago,Typical selfish behavior from poor management. Treat delivery drivers like trash and tools and not like partners. ‚Ä¶
41,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great pizza! We were impressed with quality, simply delicious! Highly recommended for delivery as well!"
42,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Professional staff, good pizza, moderate prices. very recommended"
43,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"The best pizza in Amsterdam! Recommend it as a Uber delivery, which know all kinds"
44,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I had a pizza there for ‚Ç¨15.50. the pizza was not bad, but unfortunately parts of it were burnt, it was really dry, and there was way too much oregano on it. So it wasn't that nice to eat unfortunately."
45,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazingly delicious wood oven pizza and great friendly service.  Simple quality ingredients makes a perfect pizza anytime. Loved it!!
46,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"There is something magical about a well crafted pizza, baked in a proper wood fired stone oven.
I highly recommend this visiting place, if you're interested in experiencing how a proper pizza should taste."
47,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,6 years ago,BEST food we had in Amsterdam. The staff is very friendly. The restaurant is small so you may have to wait for a table but the food is absolutely worth the wait. There are some great bars in the area to grab a drink in the meantime. GO TO PAZZI.
48,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"It was a good pizza but I find La Perla pizza and Pizzabakkers much more more delicious. I can only recommend this particular place for take aways. It's absolutely not 'gezellig' to stay there to eat. Very small, claustrophobic and loud."
49,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Well-made pizzas that can rival Italian ones. One of the best in town. Proper oven, dough and cooking. Go outside peak hours as they can sit around 20. You can also take away"
50,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Definitely in the top 5 pizza places in Amsterdam of all time. No reservations, just go there, and wait for a crunchy taste of a delicious pizza alla romana."
51,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good pizza! Fast serving
52,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best Pizza I ve ever had!!
53,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I give 5 stars because I don't have other stars to give them.

57,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Hidden gem! Eating a pizza pazzi pizza is like an angel peeing in your mouth üë∏üèºSuper friendly staff, and oh, the food is amazing. Did I mention that? Yummmm"
58,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic pizza! And definitely not slow service. Our pizzas were ready in minutes. This place was recommended to us from our Italian Airbnb host.
59,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible! When I ordered it to my home they didn't send a drink that I have payed for. When I called to the restaurant to ask what about my drink no one picked up the phone only the voice mail saying ""leave the message we will call you back"". It was on Saturday, today is Monday and still nobody call. No call, no drink, no money!!"
60,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 1 star ,2 years ago,Told me to wait on the phone and i waited for 5 minutes. I only tried to order ahead of time and I will be picking it up myself. Tried calling again and was directed to voicemail. All you needed to do was tell me how long i will have to ‚Ä¶

81,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Although it's one of the best pizzas in town, be ready to wait a lot. They take the Slow in their name seriously, but not for a better experience."

90,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Simple foods can do amazing things. Just a word of caution to people if they want fast service...speak up and tell them what you want as the squeaky wheel gets the grease.
91,Pazzi Italian Slow Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super delicious! Very friendly staff and fantastic pizza!
