1,Bosco, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Very nice cafe with a lovely view in a good location! Staff were great! The food could be better but I liked the vibe so will definitely go again!
2,Bosco, 2 stars ,a month ago,"General atmosphere was good but portions was very small. In addition, they offered mint tea with orange instead of mint :) somehow we accepted. It was disappointment. We shared everything with staff‚Ä¶"

4,Bosco, 3 stars ,a month ago,"Good environment but there were some missing things, maybe it was our luck. Butter cakes were too small like a child porsion, we ordered mint tea with ginger and orange. It came without mint since there is no mint left. We accepted it at first then we informed the waiter that we are not happy with it, nothing changed, full price paid."

13,Bosco, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good place to do some work or to catch up with your friends. Staff is very friendly. I forgot my wallet and they allow me to pay directly to their bank account (i/o having me going home to pick up my wallet). The sandwich was nice and coffee as to be expected. So all fine!

30,Bosco, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to have lunch. Especially if it's sunny, the tables outside are the best option! Their home made ginger beer is a must try (so refreshing and not too sweet!). I personally got the salad of the day, which can indeed change accordingly. This time it had shrimps, soy beans and some other veggies. Lovely!"
31,Bosco, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Always a new menu when I visit. The chef is very creative and his dishes always tasteful. They have several beers on draft, one or two change regularly. Wines are not on the menu but recommend by the staff based on your preference. Really ‚Ä¶"

36,Bosco, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff and nice terrace, but food is extremely basic Dutch style food. Egg, ham, cheese and bread. No sauces, spices, or anything particularly flavoursome. You don‚Äôt even get butter with your bread."
37,Bosco, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Dropped in for a cafe while waiting for the room to be available.  Kitty sleeping on the bench to pet. Daughter was sold. Coffee and tea was good. Very happy. Btw, they had English menus, and food, but we just had the drinks."

39,Bosco, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Relaxed atmosphere with plenty of locals. The chef overcooked our veal steaks but was quick to replace one with a perfectly cooked version. I'll be back. üòä
40,Bosco, 5 stars ,8 years ago,Friendly & attentive staff that took the time to translate their creative menu into English. Love the seasonal approach and with just 4 starters and mains to choose from I still found it difficult to make up my mind. Would definitely go again during my next trip to Amsterdam.
