1,Scheltema, 1 star ,a year ago,The place is as bad as it gets. The beer is fine but the rest? A mess. Would never recommend it. I ordered a steak medium rare....i had to butcher it myself thats how raw it was. But nevermind the salad dressing was so sour it killed all the bacteria.
2,Scheltema, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Stopped by just for a quick bite to eat and a cuppa tea. You would easily miss this place as you walked by but I’m glad I came in. Very friendly service. Prices are ok but this is central Amsterdam (I’m used to London prices anyway) our …

11,Scheltema, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Went there with a group of friends, mostly out-of-towners. The place is rustic (a bit run down comparing with other places nearby) but is it so charming we enjoyed it a lot. The staff (which I assume were two sisters who own the place) are …"

14,Scheltema, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We stopped in here by chance on our last evening in Amsterdam. It was nearly empty, which often spells trouble, but we had an excellent meal, good drinks, and good service. The cat that greeted us was a bonus. It was just the right place to end our trip. Cheers."
15,Scheltema, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Stumbled across this place while wandering around Amsterdam on a Saturday after a brutal week of business travel. It was exactly what I was looking for for a quick lunch. Local specials (ossenworst) and a beer. Friendly service, reasonably priced."
16,Scheltema, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This lovely place very close to Dam square was established in 1908 and still keeps its original character. It used to be the go-to establishment for journalists in the capital and you will still find wordsmiths here. …

18,Scheltema, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Authentic, rustic, quiet and spacious with good service. You feel tucked in that typical Dutch atmosphere despite being in the City Centre. Make sure to get cash though beforehand, they don't take cards."
19,Scheltema, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Was okay. When I asked, one of the girls told me I could sit everywhere and then suddenly the other one said 'no this one is reservated'. And the the other girls just stood there saying nothing which was a bit weird. The overall place is quite cosy which I like. The burger was not too expensive and was served very quick"
20,Scheltema, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I like the place,  my second visit to eat,  my first being on Wednesday 3rd January.  Am very pleased to have discovered this Café.  Good decent food and not overpriced.  Good friendly people working here.  Will certainly visit /eat/drink here again."

24,Scheltema, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Homey, chill spot for beer and comfort food. The meatball was INSANE. It's a small place, but really cozy and full of locals and local expats, if you're into that kind of thing. Really lucky find."
25,Scheltema, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great family style cooking. Very Dutch and very tasty. Friendly service that tries hard to accomodate.  The soup and main meal ""of the day"" were excellent."
26,Scheltema, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really enjoyed this place, very enthusiastic and friendly staff who was happy to tell me about the places history. Good quality beer and food. Not on a street you'd necessarily walk down, so we were fortunate to spot this place. Worth seeking out."
27,Scheltema, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The fish of the day was very well done and come with vegetables and fries. The snitchel was good tender and big. Very satisfay. We wanted to try the apple xake, but portions were so big that we were full. Perfect!"
28,Scheltema, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Seems ok. Popped on for a quick drink on way back to hotel and wasnt too impressed with the 11eur for 2 pints and even the owners friends faces showed shock at the price. There are cheaper, friendlier, more comfortable places."
29,Scheltema, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Went on a trip for my birthday and stopped here for lunch, can’t fault the food, but the service was a disgrace. Was not happy with how we were treated, rude staff made us feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome, seemed to patronise us numerous times, wouldn’t reccomend this restaurant/ cafe."
30,Scheltema, 1 star ,4 years ago,"When we sat ourselves down and I grabbed two menus, the waiter glared at me and said “I am the waiter, I will get it for you. This is my job."" Menu ridiculously overpriced (17eur omelette, anyone?). Tourist trap."
