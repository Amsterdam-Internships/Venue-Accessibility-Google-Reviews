0,Wok to go, 5 stars ,a month ago,"It’s a little on the pricey side, but if you live in bel air, it’s typical. this place is the best place i have found in harford county with tofu dishes. i like that the bean curd is in big pieces and still juicy in the inside. most other …"
1,Wok to go, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"This use to be the best place in bel air, well not anymore. The lady at the counter was rude when we picked up our food and then the seasame chicken was hard as a rock and dry and appeared days old. I ate maybe 1/3 the rest is going in the …"
2,Wok to go, 1 star ,a month ago,"Food made me terribly sick!!!! Almost as soon as I ate it. I had shrimp egg foo young. Tasted good, but it did not agree with me at all.."
3,Wok to go, 2 stars ,a year ago,"I really like their food, but right now I am so upset because whenever I order my food from wok togo. I say people no mushrooms on any of my food because I am allergic to mushrooms. But today my lunch special was full of mushrooms. …"
4,Wok to go, 5 stars ,2 months ago,This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. It's not worth going anywhere else in the area.
5,Wok to go, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Positives: Easy to find. Simple menu. Food ready quickly.
Negatives: Food is mediocre. Small Portions.
I've bought from here twice. Not sure I'd go back. (Haven't tried the sushi) Honestly the sushi looks great. nice place to sit and eat inside too."
6,Wok to go, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Love this place , all the staff is very friendly . I order here very often and they have the best food/service of any other Chinese place I’ve ever been to. Plus they always get me my food within the hour."
7,Wok to go, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Service. Friendly staff. Cheap prices. The food tasted good enough for the price you pay. Nothing was wrong with the food, but I wished the General Tso's had a little more flavor and spice. But again, for $6.25 and you get an egg roll.... It's perfect."
8,Wok to go, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food is amazing and very delicious. The shushi is very pleasing to the eyes and taste is phenomenal. Everyone working there is very nice which created a very positive and uplifting atmosphere/experience. Definitely would recommend it to anyone.
9,Wok to go, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"I love this place, I ordered California Rolls, Shrimp & Broccoli , with white sauce and shrimp egg rolls ...fast service & very courteous !!!"
10,Wok to go, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Everything we get here has been delicious. We just pick up since we live so close but the food is usually ready 9/10 times. We don't mind waiting a few extra minutes (the wait is usually due to us getting a lot of sushi) when they're busy because it's worth it.
11,Wok to go, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I've eaten food form wok to go several times.  I use the delivery option. I not been disappointed yet. I like the fact that Wok to Go offers both Japanese and Chinese. I've had both Stiles, the delivery time has been under 45 mim. My order has been correct everytime the delivery person was prompt and polite .i will order from them again"
12,Wok to go, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
Fast Service
Dine-In or Take-out …"
13,Wok to go, 2 stars ,7 years ago,Food is a bit oily and grease for my taste. Soup has very little flavor and I was not impressed with the restaurant. I'll try them again in a few weeks to see if they improved with more specifics on exact quality and if any changes …
14,Wok to go, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I have ordered sushi from Wok To Go many times and have never been disappointed.  The fish is always fresh and the flavors are always  spot on and consistent!  I also love the great prices lunch specials!
15,Wok to go, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very good food, customer service very nice manager very understanding. Sushi was crunchy and very flavorful. They really go above and beyond to make sure your experience is good. Have been going there a long time."
16,Wok to go, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is not what it is to be. I use to travel out of my way to come here because, let's face it, good Chinese food is hard to find. Of late, the food has been barely edible and even less tasty. Needless to say, I'm not traveling back to this establishment. I guess I'll have to stick with The Orient."
17,Wok to go, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"This place is hit or miss. One visit, they're the best in Harford County, the next, you'll wish you had just stayed home. No consistency with the food, and at these prices, there should be. The service IS consistent, however. It …"
18,Wok to go, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Ordered seasame chicken lunch special with soup and a california roll .
Everything was really good . I was hesitant bc of previous reviews but hey it was really good . And the price is awsome 👌."
19,Wok to go, 1 star ,9 months ago,Usually the food is decent. Today was the worst I've ever had. Tasted like it was reheated.
20,Wok to go, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We love their sushi and their General Tso chicken. I would highly recommend this place if you want good Chinese food. I live a little farther from this place now, but it is worth the trip."
21,Wok to go, 3 stars ,11 months ago,"I frequent this place for their cheap lunch specials. Not a place I would choose to visit with others. This isn't because it's bad, there are just better options nearby. The service is really inconsistent. Sometimes those at the front desk are friendly, other times they're borderline rude."
22,Wok to go, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Although I have had a few bad experiences with dry rice, the flavors of the food is always topnotch. The sushi is fast, fresh (made on site) and if you ask, they will give you an info sheet on the fish, where it came from, and how old it …"
23,Wok to go, 1 star ,3 years ago,Ordered yesterday and when receiving order i noticed that the delivery took 25-30 mins longer then the 40 stated on the phone. Then after recieving the food and tipping the driver i noticed afted opening that my order of fried wontons was …
24,Wok to go, 2 stars ,a year ago,"This one occasion the wonton soup was good but the Mei Fun was not. Noodles were mushy, ingredients sparse. I'll try again another day."
25,Wok to go, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Wok To Go is so hit or miss any more. Not sure if new owners or management.
We do enjoy the fresh sushi that you can watch being prepared."
26,Wok to go, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Found a staple in our food.
Owner is rude and always  very hasty to get off the phone, even when it's not even busy. Actually the woman I spoke to was so adamant about getting off the …"
27,Wok to go, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This pains me to write this review... The first time we ordered from this place they delivered the food fast and with no issues whatsoever. Tonight, I called to place an order and they refused to deliver. The restaurant is literally within a couple of miles from my house. NO PROBLEM!!! I will take my money elsewhere.
Bye-Bye!!!!"
28,Wok to go, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"I ordered the shrimp and broccoli with vegetable fried rice combination platter. The price was fair, the rice was dry, lacked flavor, and was a strange neon yellow color. The shrimp and broccoli was ok. I'm usually not picky when it comes …"
29,Wok to go, 5 stars ,3 years ago,love everything here especially general tsos chicken and the crab rangoon’s. never had any problems. the people on the phone can be kind of sluggish. overall definitely recommend.
30,Wok to go, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Food is always great! The rare time I had an issue with customer service was when I called in an order to be made by two and when I came in at two to pick up it wasnt ready. Due to the 10 minute wait I recieved a free soda and was completley content.
31,Wok to go, 2 stars ,a year ago,Definitely not as good as they used to be. Shrimp toast didn't have shrimp and over fried. Egg rolls just ok.
32,Wok to go, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Been a customer for almost 20 years.  Always a good meal.

35,Wok to go, 4 stars ,a year ago,Generally good Chinese food but the seafood delight sent me running!   Don't recommend that dish.
36,Wok to go, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Today my food was terrible. I got so many huge chunks of RAW onion in my shrimp fried rice I could barely eat it. Usually their food is OUTSTANDING!!! I am disappointed.

40,Wok to go, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Fantastic food, relaxing setting, super staff and beautifully decorated! The specials are really reasonable and it's close to the local game shop!"
41,Wok to go, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food isn't the best but they offer great value and fresh tasting ingredients. It's a mainstay in an otherwise cultural wasteland.

43,Wok to go, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Too much of a hit or miss. Last night's order was my most expensive order, but was disgusting. We trashed all the food."
