0,Cafe De Pool, 5 stars ,a month ago,Cute place. The staff was nice and the menu looks good I didn‚Äôt eat I just gar a stout but definitely will be back to try their food. The only down side is seating is limited. Other than that I recommend.
1,Cafe De Pool, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Fantastic Burgers at a lower price than those ""fancy"" burger places.
Working my way through the whole menu and am loving it all.
Guinness is pretty good also!"
2,Cafe De Pool, 5 stars ,6 months ago,we had 2 very delicious cocktails and had a nice chat with the friendly girl behind the bar. will definitely come back! :)
3,Cafe De Pool, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Falafel Wrap was tasty but very small portion. Toilet is a no go area.. small, dirty and no toilet paper."
4,Cafe De Pool, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Got the ‚Äúclub sandwich..‚ÄùIt was basically a BLT sandwich, but served with processed chicken slices.. gross. And on cheap white bread. Would not recommend. Clearly our fault for coming to a place with no one there. Might be cool for a drink though, if that‚Äôs what you are in need of."
5,Cafe De Pool, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Do not come to this place, the service is DESPICABLE! Today, my friends and I went there for some food, and whilst the food itself was ok, the three women who were working there made it a really terrible experience. First of all, they tried ‚Ä¶"
6,Cafe De Pool, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Make sure you order fries with your burger. Once i got my burger i asked for fries and it took almost 20 mins. The server placed the order but somehow even though there were only 4 people in the place who were already eating the cook ‚Ä¶
7,Cafe De Pool, 1 star ,8 months ago,Poor salad 7e for little but very little and fries for the prices
8,Cafe De Pool, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Good service, but the omlette dish is way too small. Coffee was not so great too"
9,Cafe De Pool, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Very dirty restroom! Yet another former authentic Amsterdam ""kroeg"" turned into a snackbar with food from the kilo knaller. I don't know if they still charge for using a credit card, but if so, that is illegal since a few years already."
10,Cafe De Pool, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food is good and really cheap! I ordered a chicken wrap. It was big enough to lunch. The space is nice and calm. They have a good music selection also.
11,Cafe De Pool, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The staff was friendly and attentive. The food selection was diverse and yummy! They have a broad vegetarian selection. As well as a robust selection of beers. I definitely recommended eating here.

15,Cafe De Pool, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice burgers. Good service.
16,Cafe De Pool, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice crew, cold drinks, okay bar food. Solid bar but nothing exceptional. The restrooms could use some improvement."
17,Cafe De Pool, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Kitchen very small, toilet nasty, food average and the bacon and onions were raw."
18,Cafe De Pool, 5 stars ,9 months ago,I love this place. My wife wasn't totally enamored by the toilets but as I don't need to use a female toilet then Meh. The Guinness is good. The music is good. It's small but cozy. You can relax and be as loud or quiet as you want.
19,Cafe De Pool, 1 star ,2 years ago,Food was quite underwhelming. Burger was too thin and so were the wraps. Too little fries. We were surprised to pay extra due to tax that wasn‚Äôt stated on the menu prices which is dodgy in amsterdam. We also had to pay a dodgy 1 euro service cost for using a debit card. Not worth the visit
20,Cafe De Pool, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool place, with delicious food and very good music :-)) highly recommended"
21,Cafe De Pool, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Fair enough price for the food. The place is very crowded and loud.
Tried the veggie fallafel combo menu and it was very tasty with great falafel!
Ketchup and Mayo are charged extra, even if they don't say it when asking."
22,Cafe De Pool, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The ""Falafel 'N Tahini"" was very dry and the salad was very small. Price to expensive for the meal. Better to try a better spot.
But nice personal.  :)"
23,Cafe De Pool, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Visited in late February so a little quieter across Amsterdam. Went to watch the football and we were treated like friends the whole time. Few pints and delicious food. As far as Amsterdam goes, this is a lovely bar/food crossover with clean air and proper hospitality"
24,Cafe De Pool, 1 star ,5 years ago,"It has a good selection of beers.
The burgers were awful, we also ordered the kaasaoufle and they were barely edible. The waiter took our plates although we hadn't finished yet, without asking. ‚Ä¶"
25,Cafe De Pool, 2 stars ,6 years ago,We arrived at 9pm Sunday evening and they didn't have tomatoes anymore so no salad for both of us. People who ordered burgers still got it with veggies.  We ordered starters instead which were OK. Nice collection of beers. At the end we were charged 1 euro extra for paying with cc.
26,Cafe De Pool, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great little bar with a nice selection of beers and very nice krokketten and other snacks.
Walking distance from Dam square, it made a lovely stopover on a chilly day.  I'll definitely come by for lunch or a drink next time I visit."
27,Cafe De Pool, 2 stars ,3 years ago,the bathroom is terrible!!!!.......but So many various kinds of beer-I recommend!!!
28,Cafe De Pool, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A small bar that I stopped into to get out of the rain, its quirky, ran into a group on a stag that was quite boisterous but the staff were nice if not ran off their feet. Busy little spot but I'm not sure if that's the rain or the venue as I'm not a regular."
29,Cafe De Pool, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best place on Amsterdam, great hamburgers and beers!"
30,Cafe De Pool, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It was a nice place. You can create your own burger and it include good beer. I has a view to the street. It has vegetarian options
31,Cafe De Pool, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Good burger, friendly people."
32,Cafe De Pool, 1 star ,2 years ago,Dishonest staff. Gave me three receipts. Didn't want to take off mayo and ketchup off the bill after we didn't use them and gave them back when founded out they are not free. Told us they will look at us CCTV. I felt very insecure maybe for ‚Ä¶

34,Cafe De Pool, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Burgers were great. The staff wasvery frendly, always smiling and dancing. Had vegi food as well. Food was surprisingly cheap. 10 out of 5, thanks for the late night snack :)))"
35,Cafe De Pool, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Cheaters. Where do I start. They charge more than what is listed on the menu, the portion of fries is ridiculous and for some reason the waiter asked me to pay first. Avoid at all costs."
36,Cafe De Pool, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Fast service and delicious meals
37,Cafe De Pool, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Staff was friendly, but the beer wasn't proper cooled, it was kinda warm. Price is high, but there are many beers on the card."
38,Cafe De Pool, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Ok place, service was nice but came with a social deal coupon and they did not deliver as was advertised. Would I recommrnd the place, no. Will i visit again, no!"
39,Cafe De Pool, 1 star ,2 years ago,Can't pay by card and the nearest ATM charge you 5‚Ç¨ to withdraw... Even though I had 16‚Ç¨ on me they didn't make any exception for a 17‚Ç¨ bill... I had to walk 20min to go try to find the nearest bank...... Bad customer experience
40,Cafe De Pool, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely little place. We quirky, great location in the middle of everything and reasonably priced. Great food and nice pints."
41,Cafe De Pool, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"We only ordered chips when the cafe was empty, forgot about our order and served somebody who entered after us before us. 6 euro for a pint of Guinness not the politest of staff."
42,Cafe De Pool, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place with nice people. The food and drinks were good and the price is fair. Good for a small group to sit there and have a dinner.

44,Cafe De Pool, 1 star ,3 years ago,Cool people work here. Good place for drinks. But the chicken gyro is godawful and that's all I care about.

48,Cafe De Pool, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food can be, but not warm (burger) and not too tasty. But with prices they cheat a lot. Watch the prices of beers and ask about volume."
