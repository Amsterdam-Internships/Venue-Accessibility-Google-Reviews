0,Saarein, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Good beer, good food, excelent service. My favorite in Amsterdam now"
1,Saarein, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very welcoming atmosphere! We had a great evening. Staff is lovely. Definitely will be back on our next trip to Amsterdam.
2,Saarein, 1 star ,3 months ago,"We stopped in the early afternoon for a beer but left shortly after as we never came across so rude and aggressively-behaving stuff.
Avoid this place if you don’t want your mood to be ruined for no reason."
3,Saarein, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Really nice and relaxed atmosphere. I was there early, so I have no idea how it as night time."
4,Saarein, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place with nice beer, friendly crowd and great bartenders. Would recommend it any day."
5,Saarein, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The Stonewall Inn of the Amsterdam lesbian scene, this is definitely a local spot for locals, close friends and couples - unless you muster up the courage to talk to some other patrons. It is the type of place where everyone seems to know …"
6,Saarein, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the few lesbian bars left in Amsterdam. It's 3 stories (basement pool/smoking, entry way bar, and upstairs). The decoration is eclectic. The crowd is now a mixed crowd (neighborhood crowd - gay / straight / lesbian). It's a friendly place to check out and all people are welcome."
7,Saarein, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great neighborhood lesbian bar with friendly service. They will take cash or credit. The best place to hang out is on the benches outside. There is a small sitting area upstairs and a tiny indoor smoking and pool room downstairs -which that is closed off.
8,Saarein, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Gave it a couple hours on a sunday afternoon.   There was one gay guy customer (the male bartender fawned over him and it was hard for me to get his attention to get a refill).  I was the only woman in the joint, wondering if the place …"
9,Saarein, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great old 3-storey pub. It's a tight fit when it's full but the only women-first place left in Amsterdam and absolutely worthwhile. A nice selection of veggie/vegan snacks to boot
10,Saarein, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Queerest place in the Jordaan area but inclusive and welcoming to anyone. Run by the fiercest and friendliest crew you will ever meet. Their history is very interesting, they began as a radical political lesbian café in the seventies. A …"
11,Saarein, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really chilled out bar with good music, lovely friendly staff, pool table and indoor smoking area. The pizza is so good too! Go here. It will be your favourite place!"
12,Saarein, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"There were more men that women when I went there. Good to meet people if you are a tourist, since is the only women's bar left a lot go there. It's a little tight, but has a welcome feeling to it"
13,Saarein, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Small, cosy and great neighborhood cafe open to anyone with a friendly atmosphere. Pool table, smoking table, vegan lunch on Saturdays and friendly staff."
14,Saarein, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely falaffel with free salade bar. Great tahini saus, fresh salads. Cheap. A shame it's so small so there can only site around 8 persons.."
15,Saarein, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great to meet Vametino who was an excellent host while we visited the bar which was one of the most interesting we spent time in durring our visit to Amsterdam.  The customer were all nice and interesting and we would highly recommend.
