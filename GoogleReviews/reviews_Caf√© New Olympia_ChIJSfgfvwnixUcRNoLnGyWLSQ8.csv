0,Caf√© New Olympia, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Clean, cozy bar with a pool table. Love that you can play a game of pool for only 1 euro. At pool halls I pay closer to 13 euros. Since I'm quite slow at pool, I play about 2 games in one hour. Lovely atmosphere. Will become a regular just for the option to play pool."

12,Caf√© New Olympia, 4 stars ,2 years ago,(Translated by Google) Nice place in Old West and one of the few cafes with a reasonably well-kept pool table. If you are going to play well agree the rules because some 'regulars' tend to interpret the rules solely to their own advantage …
