0,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Amazing place to eat/drink/chat/meet/date or even have an original Portuguese ‚ÄúPastel de Belem‚Äù. Tiko is great and makes the best Chicken Avocado Sandwich In the Netherlands. HOLLY is the best hostess/waitress ever: she showed me all the ‚Ä¶
1,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice trendy cafe with a good vibe.  Tasty cappuccino.
Order via the Jamezz app, order is brought to your table."
2,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of my favourite places to go for lunch. If you like TEDS, you'll probably enjoy this place as well. The chicken-avocado sandwich is phenomenal and they have great homemade ice tea. ‚Ä¶"
3,De Wasserette, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Super lovely spot.
Great for Breakfast, brunch or just a cup of coffee. ‚Ä¶"
4,De Wasserette, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Select your own seating but order yourself inside. They will bring you your food. Eggs Benedict was good. Chocolate avocado pastry sounds good in concept but was not tasty at all. Overall, just okay."
5,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best cafes I‚Äôve ever been in Amsterdam, from the staff to the food!
Are you looking for a place to have a good time alone, with a friend/partner or even make new friends! Ya here we are ;)"
6,De Wasserette, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Friendly hosts
Nice vibe
Best croissants in town :)"
7,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"De waserette has a relaxed, yet warm atmosphere. With an open kitchen, you can see the fresh bread that was baked off earlier in the morning and your eggs florentine‚Äôs being cooked. The food is delicious also."
8,De Wasserette, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice cafe/restaurant in de Pijp, close to the Albert Cuyp market. The staff here are nice. It's possible to order from the phone, and sit both inside or outside. Nice selection of hot drinks."
9,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Let me say we went on an adventure before discovering this place ! We were wandering in Pijp looking for food, I think we had a spot we wanted to go, you know one of the ""overhyped"" place. And I think that we gave up because there was way ‚Ä¶"

12,De Wasserette, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place for an early morning coffee and breakfast on the way to work. Good FriedHats coffee. Chicken avocado pancetta sandwich done as a salad of my favourite!
13,De Wasserette, 4 stars ,a year ago,Great and easy food. With the QR code on your table you can order and pay through your phone. Worked really good.
14,De Wasserette, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good coffee, eggs benedict overdone with not my fav bread and too vinegary sauce, chicken sandwich was tasty though. Crowded. Nice stuff."
15,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We loved this cafe so much that we went a few times during our trip to Amsterdam. Great coffee and service. Hearty and tasty food too.
16,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"The chicken avocado sandwich is amazing, one of the best meals I ate in Amsterdam (and I was the 5th time in Amsterdam)"
17,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"We had an excellent brunch at De Wasserette once again. Quick and friendly service. Delicious benedict eggs and exquisite pain perdu. The expresso was really good, also. We will come back, definitely."
18,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good place to eat toasts; food quality is awesome.
19,De Wasserette, 3 stars ,4 years ago,It's a cute and cozy spot with loads of outdoor seating available. The food itself was standard but not memorable.
20,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"One dish to rule them all the avocado, chicken & pancetta with parmezan cheese. And if that's really not your thing then everything else is great too. Very busy always as it's a local Hotspot for the incrowd. Good chance of spotting celebs."
21,De Wasserette, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice place well located with an outside terrasse and friendly feeling.
Though one downside, the black American coffee comes only one size; quite small"
22,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is always good here, my favourite is the avocado chicken (best in town). Coffee is great. Would recommend."

24,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Super Nice brunch place.
Kip avocado sandwich & schrimp croquettes were super Nice."
25,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Delicious coffee, best avocado sandwich in Amsterdam - crispy bacon, spicy chicken thighs, truffle mayonnaise and Parmesan, to die for!"
26,De Wasserette, 1 star ,a year ago,Terrible! Overpriced food in the Pijp. Waiters seem to have no clue what they are doing; they gave the wrong order and while we mentioned that this was not our order they kept insisting it was our order. In the end the table next to us (of ‚Ä¶

29,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Exactly what we wanted for a Saturday brunch, located on a lovely square and although rightly busy there were plenty of seats. Coffee was top notch and we inhaled the food. Great start to the day."
30,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,4 months ago,I love it there. Wonderful people work there and service is amazing
31,De Wasserette, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Good food and great location. We had luckily one of the tables inside but the staff didn't greet us. None of them. After 5 to 10 minutes we no noticed that we had to order at the bar. People/ staff make the place if you ask me so I would say that this is definitely something to improve on.
32,De Wasserette, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Relatively busy at the weekends, with staff that seems a little stressed, as well as food that tastes allright, but one suspects it could have used a little less stress in the kitchen. Menu and coffee are nice, but probably its a better place to come during the week or when less busy..."
33,De Wasserette, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Cannot understand why the place was packed - food very average and took 40 mins to arrive, sourdough had no taste and had texture of regular white bread - a con? Then huge front door was opened permanently  because ""it's busy"" - we ended up eating in our coats...inside the cafe! Reserve a table at Old Collins around the corner instead!!"
34,De Wasserette, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Charming caf√© with tasty food, we went there for a brunch and I had chicken/avocado/manchego on a toast while my friend took eggs Norwegian. We were both happy with the food (the chicken was good but not amazing though). Coffee are really ‚Ä¶"
35,De Wasserette, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I recommend this as a great place for coffee and brunch. I often go there. But beware the waiters if you catch them on a bad day. The last time I went they forgot my order completely so they became quite angry with me, the customer. LOL"
36,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Very nice brunch place with fresh ingredients and super nice menu !
37,De Wasserette, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The barista is dreadful (tall with dark hair in a ponytail and light beard). Clearly loathes his job.  After talking for a long period to one of his friends with coffee waiting to be served, he eventually picked it up dumped it on my table. ‚Ä¶"
38,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Favourite place for breakfast and lunch in the city. Service is great, coffee is great, food is fresh and very tasty. ‚Ä¶"
39,De Wasserette, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Basic brunch place. The avocado on toast was dry, and didn't taste of anything. The waiters are all pretty miserable too. Plenty of better options in the area."
40,De Wasserette, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Another restaurant that lost his mojo on the way. It used to be simple food now it has become really bad. I ordered a lam burguer really well done, what do I got a medium mostly red. I was feeling do much like having a burger that I made no ‚Ä¶"

44,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This was a lovely place to have a relaxing breakfast. The food was amazing. It was really busy but the outside seating made it a nonissue.
45,De Wasserette, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It's good and cheap. However, there is no waitress, the dishes are quite simple. If been to better brunch places."
46,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great service and great food. 5 stars!
47,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Excellent service. Many smiles and warm welcome. As a foreigner I felt right at home. You have the do-it-yourself or full service options. Go full service and come back 4-5 hours later to pick it up. Enough time to go around town.
48,De Wasserette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best Eggs Benedict in De Pijp. But, in the weekend super crowded and it takes time to find a place to sit. ‚Ä¶"

58,De Wasserette, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very standard. Portions are big enough, but expensive for what you get. there are a lot more places that serve better quality for the same price. Still worth a try"
59,De Wasserette, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Top marks for location, selection, quality of food and outdoor seating. Definitely worth a visit for lunch, coffee or drinks."
