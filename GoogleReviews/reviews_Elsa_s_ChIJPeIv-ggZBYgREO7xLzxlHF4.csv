0,Elsa's, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Me and my man loveeeeee this place. First of all the vibes and the ambience is real smooth. It gives you like a real luxury but laid back vibe. I had the pork and my husband had the fish. The pork was juicy and well seasoned. I also had wings for appetizers and they were the bomb. I would definitely recommend this spot
1,Elsa's, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Not to be missed! Years ago, to any to count, this was our place... So, we decided to stop by while visiting - for memories sake. The burgers are still the best and don't forget the Hell Fire fries. The wait can be long, ours (a party of 7) ‚Ä¶"
2,Elsa's, 3 stars ,a month ago,"Good food. Beautiful setting.

Not the best presentation for the sandwich basket. The 2 slices of watermelon ‚Ä¶"
3,Elsa's, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Absolutely loved the food ,atmosphere and decor.  Great service we sat at the bar and had excellent service. Great menu food and drinks. I had the beet salad it was excellent I still am thinking about how good it was. I also had the fries on the side Yumm.  The burger was excellent  as well. Definitely going back !!  100% in every way"
4,Elsa's, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"It's an interesting mix of fancy, mostly in appearance, and very much not so, in the food. The only place I have ever been to order a wonderfully made French 75, then a sandwich served with fries and and cantaloupe slices."
5,Elsa's, 1 star ,2 months ago,"I hate leaving a bad review but I don't suggest anyone wasting your money coming here. We were seated immediately, on a Saturday night at 5pm, and I knew it was going to be busy. Wet then waited an extended period of time for our waiter to ‚Ä¶"
6,Elsa's, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,Visited based on recommendations of friends. Server was nice but our service was very slow. I'm not sure if the kitchen and bar were to blame. Drink service was sporadic. Our salads were missing ingredients as well as the toast or croissant ‚Ä¶
7,Elsa's, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Delicious food! The atmosphere was lounge and fancy but there were classic burger choices on the menu that were delicious. We ordered the pork appetizer and it was amazing. I could eat that forever. Service was quick and friendly. We were given a postcard with the bill to keep which I thought was a cool add.
8,Elsa's, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Burgers were amazing, so was the chocolate torte. The ambiance of the restaurant is bizarre, it appears to be fine dining by the waitstaff‚Äôs clothing and table setups, but the bathrooms are fluorescent blue and purple as if you‚Äôre in a ‚Ä¶"
9,Elsa's, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Amazing food, great service, and fun atmosphere. Will definitely be back when we are in town! All of our burgers/sandwiches were made perfect. Cocktails, wine, and beers hit the spot."
10,Elsa's, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great little venue, very up and coming restaurant. Service was spot on, very busy but not ignored."
11,Elsa's, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Service dog friendly. Amazing food. Plant based options. Summer our server was AWESOME to the point we won't go back unless we call first and she's working. We will be back.
12,Elsa's, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"The food (prices have increased) and service was good however  I  was not comfortable with the 18% service charge automatically added to my bill. Also, was charged $2-3 for hot sauce,  which I  thought was a no charge condiment. Loved the atmosphere, nice and classy as always."
13,Elsa's, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Great staff, still great Martinis but the crowd has really changed over the years.  It was common to bump into Milwaukee's business community and often times, pro athletes. ‚Ä¶"
14,Elsa's, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Always awesome food.  Great atmosphere for either a business lunch/dinner, casual lunch/dinner e/friends or pre-theatre meal.  Cocktails are also very good."
15,Elsa's, 4 stars ,10 months ago,Talk about fun! We arrived a little before 8pm and the place was packed! They do not take reservations and there was an hour wait; we got lucky as two seats opened at the bar just a few moments after we walked in. I ordered a Sidecar and it ‚Ä¶

17,Elsa's, 1 star ,a month ago,"First let's start with service. Much room to be improved. I get the vibe of the room but sorry I don't like my server to cuss, use follow terminology or lexicon in such a way that downgraded my experience. The food now let me truly begin. ‚Ä¶"
18,Elsa's, 3 stars ,2 months ago,"Looks like a fancy place, but it's an overpriced deli. Our server was awesome. The food was good, my beer was hot..."
19,Elsa's, 5 stars ,a month ago,Laid back atmosphere with a whimsical yet modern design. The food was fabulous and fresh and the cocktails are delicious and STRONG to boot. Will definitely be returning.
20,Elsa's, 3 stars ,10 months ago,It was not the Elsa's I knew prior to the pandemic. The wait staff was excellent but the vibe and the ambiance was missing. I ordered the pork planks and they were meh and cold. One thing my friends and I did agree upon was that the drinks were still fabulous!!! The outing missed the mark for me.
21,Elsa's, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This restaurant was recommended by the hotel front desk and he was spot on (shout out to Ken-at the front desk)!! Recommend trying Lemon Drop martini, grilled veggies and the pork chop calabresi. The pork chop calabresi was so good that I forgot to take a picture of it. Service was great, Food was great, atmosphere was great too."
22,Elsa's, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great Food Great Service Excellent Vibe. 1st time there today on a surprise date with my fianc√©. She's been id never had. I enjoyed it dearly. I tried the pork chop plate and I also took hot wings to go which now that im home have been consumed! They were soooo good juicy and fresh tasting. Highly recommend.
23,Elsa's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Five star service five-star food great location and always busy. I like we can order a late-night dinner and relax without being rushed out the door by 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. do check their website but I believe they offer hours until 11:00 12:00 and even 1:00 a.m.
24,Elsa's, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"An upscale and sophisticated environment makes the uninitiated think they have wandered into a restaurant with fancy, obscure menu items, but THIS is Milwaukee and THIS is Elsa's on the Park. THIS swanky place is about to serve up excellent ‚Ä¶"
25,Elsa's, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"This was my first time going to Elsa's on the Patk. It's A very small, very fancy elegant restaurant. Not meant for little kids. It's a very popular restaurant so I would recommend calling to make reservations before you go. Went for my ‚Ä¶"

27,Elsa's, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Excellent vibes, great food and music."
28,Elsa's, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Elsa's never disappoints!  I always have the Burger Las Brisas, that features salsa, avocado, cheese, jalapenos, onion....AND the mini turtle sundae for dessert.  It is about 5 bites, which is just enough sweet to finish off the experience."
29,Elsa's, 5 stars ,a year ago,When we first walked in we were skeptical... No one was by the door nor was there a sign suggesting where to go to see a host. We waited for some time before one of the waiters finally told someone who came and got our info. We waited for ‚Ä¶
30,Elsa's, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The teriyaki wings are the best in Milwaukee  so far. This is why Elsas get 5 stars. Pork plate is awesome as well. The restaurant is in need of a little make over though. Not as upscale as it once was. The vibe, however is still great."
31,Elsa's, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"How has Elsa‚Äôs been so good for so long? I just love this place and have been going for the past 20 + years. Every meal has been consistently delicious, the service always wonderful. Think of all the traffic going through this place and it ‚Ä¶"
32,Elsa's, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I enjoyed myself. It was very laid back great conversations with a Doctor, and my first time here. Sad that I didn't get my hot wings fried hard. So until I return and get my wings fried hard I'll have to pass on them. The moment I seen ‚Ä¶"
33,Elsa's, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"In a gorgeous building right on the park you‚Äôll find Elsa‚Äôs, where a menu item called ‚ÄúJust Broccoli‚Äù will even blow your mind. I had the APV burger which surprises and delights even for a gourmet burger. Each bite is a little different ‚Ä¶"
34,Elsa's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is my second time dining at Elsa's. I thought nothing could top my first experience here with my fiancee, but was impressed yet again. The service experience is unmatched for a late night restaurant. I enjoyed the more quiet section in ‚Ä¶"
35,Elsa's, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Stopped in for a late dessert. The food was good and so was the service. We tried the Golden Gate Cake, which was recommended by our server."
36,Elsa's, 5 stars ,a year ago,Get the pork APV SANDWICH! With bacon & gargonzola-you WILL NOT regret it! Bursts of flavor! Amazing! The strawberry shortcake is pretty good & so are the wings.
37,Elsa's, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Nachos are always very good wings have been decent Iately and the crowd of patrons I see lately  are not my cup of tea I‚Äôll just say that.
38,Elsa's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I came into town to visit friends and we were reminiscing about favorite spots in town.  What has gone by the wayside, what is still there.  I mentioned Elsa's and was extremely pleased they were still in existence. ‚Ä¶"
39,Elsa's, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Food was great. Forgot what I had tho. Service was good. Sat at the bar. The place came highly recommended from the concierge at our hotel. It did not disappoint.

45,Elsa's, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I would highly recommend this place! The service here is amazing and also the food & drinks. It‚Äôs a little pricey but completely worth it.

47,Elsa's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Outstanding atmosphere right in downtown Milwaukee.  The food is really, really good - as is its presentation (see photo of bacon-wrapped chestnuts with a honey-based dipping sauce). ‚Ä¶"
48,Elsa's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The burger is mediocre but the grilled cheese is good. The place is very busy and has a lively atmosphere. Good customer service. I wouldn't go with a group larger than four: not enough room and a very long wait. I went with one person and didn't have a problem but I saw a larger group waiting pretty much the entire time I was eating.
49,Elsa's, 5 stars ,9 months ago,I have shared this place to entertain family and friends (grown ups) ELSA'S is very well located downtown on Cathedral Square any the .en and women that work there never fail to deliver a perfect .artificial and burger! Please check your ‚Ä¶

58,Elsa's, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Visited Elsa's for a Friday lunch with a friend. We were seated promptly (around noon) and the service was ok (our waitress seemed stiff and not very friendly).

Food is always delicious - one thing we ALWAYS get are the bacon wrapped ‚Ä¶"
71,Elsa's, 4 stars ,6 months ago,The experience was wonderful as usual. The only thing that I can complain about is that our server was not the best and she didn't offer us hot towels.

99,Elsa's, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The staff was very friendly.  Clean and a nice atmosphere.  Iam vegetarian so there was little options of what I could eat. The veggie truck sandwich was good.

106,Elsa's, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The place ambiance is good. Good pricing, looks fancy but affordable dining options. Wine inst exorbitant either. However though, the pork sandwiches were too dry , and the server managed to break the wine cork. My wine had a bunch of tiny cork pieces in it. So maybe not the best service? Or I just had bad luck."
107,Elsa's, 1 star ,5 years ago,If I could give zero stars I would. This was the absolute worst restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life. After reading previous reviews I gave the restaurant a try and was completely disappointed. The service was terrible; our ‚Ä¶

111,Elsa's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Loved the grilled cheese there. You'd melt with the cheese and avocado on the sandwich. Thanks to Collins from Taylor's for suggesting this place. And the Gooey buttery cake :P so sweet :D. Most bartenders here were great. Nachos are good ‚Ä¶
112,Elsa's, 5 stars ,6 years ago,I loved every single bite I had. Service was perfect. Food was outstanding and soo good I dreamt about it after I got home from the club. Talk about an upscale burger joint. You feel like you are at a $40 a plate place but the prices are ‚Ä¶

115,Elsa's, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Worst beet salad in the city, and very expensive.  Had exactly 3 slices of beet in the entire salad.  The nachos are tasty but no sour cream in the restaurant, oh well.  Decent drinks, nice atmosphere, late night menu till 1am on weekdays ‚Ä¶"
116,Elsa's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food here is GREAT!! They take classic dishes & put a more upscale spin on them. What's nice is after 5pm, only people over the age of 21 are allowed in the restaurant because they have a large bar & are serving alcoholic beverages. My ‚Ä¶"

120,Elsa's, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Elsa's on the park is beautiful.  I loved the four seasons salad with chicken.  It was pretty basic and so was the strawberry shortcake.  But the service was impeccable and that is why I gave it 5 stars!  Consistent food and great service is rare these days!  Elsa's gets it right and is beautiful on the inside and out.
121,Elsa's, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Trendy spot, that serves slightly overpriced burgers and wings. I ordered ""The Burger"" which comes with your selection of onions, order of fries,  and a small side of fresh vegetables and fruit for $11.50, with a Moscow mule that was $9.50. ‚Ä¶"
122,Elsa's, 3 stars ,a year ago,"They add the tip already 18 percent but the service is a tad off since they don't have to work for it. My fries was oily and over cooked, paid for beacon on my cauliflower mix but it wasn't added. Had to leave my table to go to the bar and order another drink. Over charged for covid-19"
123,Elsa's, 4 stars ,a year ago,Great food best cocktails!!
124,Elsa's, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Wait time to be seated was long and there is absolutely no space to walk around tables you are literally bumping in to people and chairs on every step. The food was good but I was finished with my meal before the waiter brought out the condiments. The starburst martini is the only reason for the 3 star rating

129,Elsa's, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Elsa's on the park is beautiful.  I loved the four seasons salad with chicken.  It was pretty basic and so was the strawberry shortcake.  But the service was impeccable and that is why I gave it 5 stars!  Consistent food and great service is rare these days!  Elsa's gets it right and is beautiful on the inside and out.
130,Elsa's, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Bartenders are the best! Super cool adult urban vibe with conversation starting wall art. It‚Äôs all tasty but try the Burger AuPoivre, the Grouper and any Martini."
131,Elsa's, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Came out for dessert and coffees after dinner.. looks great but taste was insanely disappointing
132,Elsa's, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Busy. The wings are good, price has seemed to increase. I wouldn't order a drink there though after seeing the area at the bar. I watched them put used in dirty glasses in an area with spillage from drinks on the metal part. Then not wipe ‚Ä¶"
133,Elsa's, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Bring back the waffle fries and PLEASE your pricing is getting insane. A good burger but the waiters need to be more attentive. I've been coming here for over 20 years. Love the vibe but the prices are getting outrageous
134,Elsa's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's a nice upscale restaurant, food was great beverages were delicious. Our waitress,Janet, was phenemonal. The only minor issue were the small seats and tables, it can get uncomfortable at times. Overall it was a great experience."
135,Elsa's, 5 stars ,a month ago,The wings are still delicious but too expensive
136,Elsa's, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Today i arrived to Elsa‚Äôs at 4pm and was seated. I did not receive a menu until 4:20 due to my family sitting in the back, the waiter said we would slow him down. Due to sitting in the back. Seeing that we were the fourth table in the ‚Ä¶"

142,Elsa's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Elsa's still has the same wonderful quality and ambiance that it did 30 years ago. I visit Elsa's twice a year when visiting Milwaukee.

143,Elsa's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food, beautiful presentation and a bright and airy environment.  The staff were kind and welcoming. The truck garden sandwhich was incredible. I will be coming back again."

145,Elsa's, 4 stars ,4 years ago,I've been too many times to count. Always get the wings. They are usually great but a couple times they were cooked too hard. Drinks are very good. Service is always good. Will be back!
146,Elsa's, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I was excited to go to Elsa's for the first time to try the highly praised chicken wings and left with utter disappointment! I ordered a plate of the the buffalo wings and they tasted like dental floss, like they rolled the chicken around ‚Ä¶"
147,Elsa's, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Everything was awesome but being able to reserve a table should be an option because when you arrive you have to wait to be paged anyways.

153,Elsa's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Been a patron for 30 years and it has always been a phenomenal experience. I have been a follower and patron of all of Karl's restaurants No better custard than Kopps  ( not Culvers nor Gilles).  Bravo and fantastic food, drinks and service.  Come and enjoy."
154,Elsa's, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Although my dining experiences are usually ok, Elsa‚Äôs has a reputation for discriminating against some of their diners. For that reason I don‚Äôt frequent Elsa‚Äôs but the food and cocktails are fairly enjoyable. The lemon drop is one of the best."

156,Elsa's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I live in Arizona and go to both AZ 88 and Hanny's so I was very happy that I had the chance to see Elsa's where it all started. And it did not disappoint. Great martinis and food.... Great experience at all three places!!
157,Elsa's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The ultimate martini bar!! They fill a martini glass all the way to the top. Literally. You can't pick it up off the bar without spilling it. And to top off of the strong drinks, they have killer bar food at reasonable rates. A lot of healthy options too! Try the grilled vegetable platter or spicy cauliflower."
158,Elsa's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing desserts!!! You guys have to try the strawberry cheesecake and their golden gate cake! My husband and i shared both and it was amazing! I'm so glad we found this place for a late night dessert craving!üôåüèºüëåüèºüëçüèº

163,Elsa's, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Best burger place in town in my opinion. Really good burger, even better ambiance. The location on Cathedral Square is spectacular. Going there in the winter when the park is decorated for Christmas is a real treat."
164,Elsa's, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"This place is fantastic the food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is great! I went on a busy night and then on a pretty empty afternoon. The server I had on the night I went was great she was very sweet, the server I had today made it seem ‚Ä¶"
165,Elsa's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The atmosphere is perfect and there is always crafty art/decorations. The Golden Gate Cake is must have, I rarely order dessert but this one is worth it. A bit on the pricey side, but worth it."

168,Elsa's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,If you have a taste for delicious buffalo wings with blue cheese (like no other) and a mouth watering lemon drop martini (made by Anton) this is the place to be. There is truly no place like Elsa‚Äôs in Milwaukee.
