0,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The 'gourmet' burgers didn't live up to expectations.  The patty did not have much flavor, and the blue cheese simply overpowered it. It was also unevenly grilled, leaving grey patches here and there.  The bun felt dry and  flavorless. …"
1,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious burgers, probably the best I’ve had in Europe this trip (4 countries). Staff super friendly! Burgers are thick and cooked to perfection. The bun was also delicious. Would recommend to anyone in the area and they do offer nice …"
2,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Honestly a nice burger place. I think the beef burgers are better than the kip. Sauce had a nice tingly taste …
3,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Generous portion sizes for a reasonable price. Great location right next to canal. Staff were all friendly and very helpful. The outside seating area is really nice, no one was sat inside as the weather was great. The burgers here are great!"
4,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I had the Classic Burger with fries and a strawberry lemonade. The burger was juicy and had good flavor. The fries were decent. The strawberry lemonade was just OK. The inside dining room was closed so I ate outside. It was a good place to people watch. Serving staff was polite, food was served quickly (they weren't very busy)."
5,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Gourmet burgers for a good price.

The cheeseburger was one of the best I've ever eaten. It had nice buns and the …"
6,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good hamburger. Prices are not cheap, but they have a student menu with the classic hamburger and fries for 9 euros. Totally worth it!"
7,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to sit outside in the better weather. Waitress was super friendly and helpful. Service was perfect, sadly the burger was a little undercooked and the fries a little over cooked. That said I’d be more than happy to give the place another try."
8,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Decided to come back to try the poutine for a second time after a disappointing first visit. I was not dissatisfied this time! Tasty iced tea and milkshake too!
9,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly service, a good bun, and decent fries. But the experience was brought down by a bland patty that was being overpowered by a sauce that on any other burger would have been nothing more than a background note. …"
10,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice burger, not the best. I tried the New Meatlover, the meat was very well done, but somehow the burger is missing something or not completely balanced."
11,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,4 years ago,I haven't tried burgers but this is definitely not a good place for a coffee. I got a late in a glass instead of a cup and there is no handle and it's far too hot to hold by hand. Undrinkable until it gets cold.
12,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great hot choc!! My friends burgers looked good but was a lot of effort to get the student menu 🙂
13,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really, but really really good burgers. Chief knows how to prepare lekker burger. Everything was so yummy. Waitress was really hospitable and friendly. We had one of the best cocktails in Amsterdam at this place. Highly recommended 👌 Thank you Milan and Chaimae for this post corona experience."
14,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,a year ago,"Such a shame. Came here to have lunch with a friend on a hot summer day. Ideal location by the canal.
We made our order and asked for tap water, which we were rudely told was not …"
15,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good burgers with plentiful outdoor seating. Very friendly service too!
16,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"TL;DR: food is good, mediocre service at best.

The burgers were very good (although slightly on the small size for the price). …"
17,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I've been there several times now, and I was never disappointed. I absolutely love the burgers, but this time all the good side dishes were already sold out! The menu was only half, of what it normally was, and we got this information, as …"
18,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Firstly, we went on a Sunday night but they were very understaffed (one person serving and one person in the kitchen). Regardless of this we were given fantastic service by the lovely Leah. She is a credit to the business and works so hard …"
19,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We did not have a good experience here. I am vegan and went here with a non-vegan, so that we had options for the both of us. When I asked the waiter if the nacho's were vegan without the sour cream - he said he didn't know. And that was …"
20,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I visited Ellis few weeks ago with my daughter and enjoyed the atmosphere, service and food. The staff is pleasant and helpful, they were happy to meet my daughters wish to get grilled veggies with her burger instead of sauce and she …"
21,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Bad food and service. Burger is okayish for Dutch standards (you hungry tourists won't be too disappointed), but the fries are old and dry. I asked for new ones, and after having to insist in front of 2 waitresses (what customer service is …"
22,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,This is a good place for a quick fix. The staff is nice and the menu has a good selection of different foods. We were impressed by the number and variety of vegi burgers. Unfortunately the burger buns and the coleslaw are not as tasty as in other restaurants. Still a solid performance. The home made ice tea is highly recommend. ;)
23,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,5 years ago,The staff is nice and quick. However burgers were only mildly warm when served so that was a disappointment. And on early Sunday afteroon they were already out of onion rings. Burgers are not so big so if you're not really hungry they can …
24,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ordered a medium burger, but received it rare. Could happen, no worries and I told the staff and they cooked the same piece. When i received the burger back, it was still rare. I told the again, that we're leaving, cause i was very …"
25,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Server outside was nice. Partner ordered a burger plain well done but came out with a few items on it. Sent back and it came back plain charred on the outside but pink on the inside. Chips weren't great either. All in all a disappointing experience
26,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely great burgers with fresh ingredients and juicy meat. The side dishes were also adding flavor to the already perfect taste of the food. My preference is the burger prepared with west Flanders beef together with  big pint of …
27,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice food! One of the best hamburger I ever tried. The attendants were not kind. But the food was worthy. Not many people in the end of afternoon. It's not necessary to book before. Besides of a canal, and a nice view."
28,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I wasn't expecting much and was completely surprised - the food was excellent.  Everything fresh.  Staff was courteous and attentive too - which is hard to come by in cities in the Netherlands. Great vegetarian options on the menu and it's …
29,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went here twice while in Amsterdam, the first time was amazing, really good staff and delicious food, one of the best burgers I've had, second time was still delicious and everyone was friendly, but I think they were a bit understaffed so …"
30,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice drinks, nachos and fries, burgers were okay. However the service could've been way better. Took over 30 minutes before we were noticed to order some drinks on a not too busy wednesday afternoon. If staff checks in more often to see if the customer is alright this would make it a lot better."
31,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"If you don’t like waiting don’t go there.
First we were told to sit anywhere. We chose a table and the waitress let’s us know that we couldn’t sit there. (Nothing big but annoying) …"
32,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Hamburger was good, home cooked and all. Would come again. Although the attitude seemed a bit off, refusing to give a glass of tap water unless you buy another drink. Piece of advice. If you want water, bring your own. That's what I'll do next time"
33,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Service is slow and mixed (the sides ordered later came first and then the main dishes and then more sides)... But the worst point is the taste of the burger; highly disappointing, no flavor in the meat. Their coleslaw and the fries were …"
34,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very delicious burgers and nice ambience.
35,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very tasty burgers with good fillings and a great combination of sauces which overall made the burgers interesting. …
36,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The burger was very tasty. And we had Gin&Tonic there which was great. Also they serve homemade Ice Tea which is fairly good. The setting of the place is spacious and in the morning (thanks to the glass roof), the natural light shines down which is a very good place for chilling out. I want to go back there again."
37,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Burgers were really good. You do pay Amsterdam Central prices!

The entire inside section was closed off, probably that's normal based on …"
38,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Phenomenal burger! Slightly differently style brioche buns, but so tasty!"
39,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,Ellis Gourmet Burger was by far the worst dining experience I have had in years. It took 30 minutes for our food to get out after we ordered. It was massively overpriced. The burgers were overcooked and they didn't even bring all of our …
40,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Saw the reviews online were good but not great, but I live nearby so I wanted to come see for myself. …"
41,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Unfortunately poutines are disappointing, so don't order them. The burger on the other hand is great. Doneness was not right but the bun is awesome (next level even), soft but not soggy. I had Blue Cheese Madness, the red onion chutney was greatly complement by chunks of blue cheese and rocket."
42,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,From the outside it looked very nice and we thought it must be the best burger in town. Then we had to order 4 times because everything we wanted in the beginning they were out of. The burgers were ok and we received a side dish we didn‘t order because they were out of it. The staff is very friendly though.
43,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Absolutely atrocious. We arrived and ordered our food fine and enjoyed our drinks while we waited for our food. After 45 minutes, the waitress returned to tell us that three of the four burgers we ordered were out of stock. We ended up …"
44,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent, courteous, helpful service for lunch. None of this Dutch-styled pressed meat, overdone beef patty. This was more the consistency, moistness, and medium rare grilled beef patty. The burgers are large and the fries were homemade. …"
45,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Enjoyed our experience here. Staff were great, accommodating and friendly. Great location especially for tourists who want to sit out by the canal. The burgers were tasty and chips nice and crunchy but not my ultimate burger experience in Amsterdam."
46,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really good burgers and fries, also liked their milkshakes. The outside seating by the canal is by far their best feature, since the prices are a bit high, even for Amsterdam standards. …"
47,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,6 years ago,"I've read the reviews and thought I was about to have one of the best burgers ever.
First round came cold and undercooked, we got a new round and got a hot burger, …"
48,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We stopped for lunch and to enjoy canal view. We ordered a burger with jalapeños and fries. The server who took our order was very attentive and nice. When our order arrived, the server who brought it was in a hurry and threw the plates on …"
49,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Went two days in a row, first day they didn’t have some stuff that we wanted but what we got was still pretty good. When we went the next day it was pretty slow so we were expecting it to be pretty quick. We got our lemonade and we waited …"
50,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We were a group of 7, show up at 21:30 on a Friday night, the lights are on, the door is open, and we’re greeted with a “Ehm...but the place is empty, are you sure you want to eat here”, followed by a “Oh, but our kitchen already started …"
51,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Sat here for an hour. Didn't get to order food ""someone else will be with you"": nope. Didn't happen. Bottled beer was lukewarm. Recommendation if you don't care and just want to sit on any terrace with any food and drinks and don't get …"
52,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice burgers selection in a new local, quite comfortable. Outside they have several tables to eat by the canal too. …"
53,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"We tried a lot of burger places in Amsterdam together with colleagues, but this one is one of the best (maybe the best). Good burger on a good bun. Better bun than everywhere else. Good sauce as well. Also the french fries were good. …"
54,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,High end burgers (gourmet). Funny menu. Great times has by all. Yuvi had a great milkshake with genuine fresh fruit in the blend. You can sit outside which is a very welcome bonus to your breakfast/lunch/dinner or other needs. Thank you so much!
55,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Horrible place, slow attention and burger was really awful (cold burger) bad taste, looks an overheated cheese. I didn’t understand the hype, when we talk with a supervisor, she didn’t offer any solution and we spend 14 euros for a terrible meal. I never come back."
56,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really great vegan burgers
57,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great burgers, very tasty. The meat was consistent yet didn't feel heavy on the stomach. Very satisfying and crusty fries (one extra star for the ""Belgian"" and not ""French"" fries)"
58,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious burgers served by the nicest staff.
59,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I had been in Ellis at Brugge before and it was a great experience but coming to Ellis Amsterdam was a little disappointing, the burgers weren't warm enough after waiting for a quite a time, despite being starving we were left very …"
60,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Took long to get food. Fries were cold, calimari very greasy. But reasonable for this price in city centre Amsterdam. …"
61,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Ellis is a great burger restaurant. Their special burgers have the perfect combination of ingredients, using fresh vegetables and prime beef (or fish, or chicken, or mushrooms). Their kiwi lemonade is happy and fresh. I strongly recommend …"
62,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty! The prices are little bit too high, but for that location it is still acceptable. One thing left very bad impression to me: when we arrived they were some tables remaining unserved and during all our stay and even after we left …"
63,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good burger place with enough room for large groups. There were 9 of us in our party. Finding a burger joint in Central Amsterdam was tricky. This one was perfect. No gluwine though. And they made a fuss about bringing tap water to the table (but that was common all over Amsterdam).
64,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,4 years ago,For a gourmet burger joint it perhaps is misleading - it is just a burger place. Veggie options are nice enough but not overwhelming and feel a little 'mass produced'. But if you want burger and chips at a reasonable price canal-side it is good.
65,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food is mediocre at best at this location. Had a far more pleasant experience at the location in Mechelen , Belgium where at least the food was fresh. Service hereis slow , and poor. …"
66,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I really do not understand the hype. We were two and we came at 7:15 pm and left at 8:00 and during that time not a single other customer was in the restaurant. The interior was really boring and somewhat ""expected"" (in a negative way) of a …"
67,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Great service, fries and homemade lime kiwi lemonade. We had the Vega ""crazy"" red burger. We were both looking at it like; ""Is that all?!"" - all the ingredients listed were there but not very generous. I'm not a big eater but this was not enough."
68,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great burger with a lovely view!
69,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Burger patties were tough and the bread was nothing great either. Disappointing fries as well. The jacket potatoes were decent. Overall, nothing to write home about, apart from friendly staff and good location by the canal. Wouldn't go back."
70,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Tasty burgers with a fun atmosphere.
71,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,5 years ago,"They forgot to bring us drinks and fair enough, that can happen to anyone. But there wasn't any apology, it was more ignorant service than in most places I've been to. It didn't help that waitresses kept running behind my back asking me to …"
72,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"After reading all the different reviews, we wanted to find out by ourselves what Ellis Gourmet Burger is really like... And I have to say that we really like this place!!! There is a good vibe, good food and a nice and friendly crew!!! Make sure to pay them a visit:)"
73,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Service was frighteningly poor. Waitress with red fake hair was hostile instead of welcoming. Average burgers. Chips were refried too many times, brown and too crispy.  Nice but expensive milkshakes."
74,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A bit pricey for what you get, otherwise a nice lunch stop"
75,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,Awful awful place. Short staffed therefore Waited 45 mins for a burger. Chicken burger had a thin slither of chicken that was probably 25 per cent of the size of the bun. Refused to eat this ridiculously small overpriced burger and left the restaurant. Stay away!
76,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Burgers are well prepared but the quality of the meet is sadly not that good.
Overall still a decent lunch but doesn't justify  the price or the slogan ""best burger in town""."
77,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Before even ordering, had to complain about no soap in men's toilets, but this was quickly fixed by a friendly waitress.   Ordered two burgers, one of which appeared to be raw inside.  Only realised after eating most of it, as it was hidden …"
78,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Would not recommend for food, the location was nice, the waitress was welcoming and attentive but the burgers came out quick and this is because they were raw! The burger was so bloody the bottom bun was soggy."
79,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fortunate to be there on a sunny day, the pavement cafe setting was a great way to break a long day of sightseeing and walking. The Heinekens are cold, the burgers are big and juicy, and the fries are crispy and served with signature seasoned mayo."
80,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"mediocre place more of a  touristtrap, cant even make a decent coffee (coffee grounds in the coffee when asked to make a new one same thing with lame excuse) and the burger is wayy over priced. They talk big about being the best but very much under deliver."
81,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,a year ago,"MOUSE.  This place has MICE. Average food,  unapologetically arrogant staff. No offer of discount, after acknowledging the mouse lives there every day and there are complaints every day... apparently this is completely normal and not an issue.  Really disappointing.  Horrible to find out at end of meal. Do not recommend."
82,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Visited the local yesterday. The burger and the fries were both exquisite, the staff extremely friendly and attentive! Loved the whole experience."
83,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Mediocre burgers for a ""gourmet"" buger joint, meal salad was also below par, so were the fries that i took with the burger and i though prices were a bit steep for the not so gourmet burger. Location and terrace are nice though, but there are much better places to get a burger."
84,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Awesome restaurant in the heart of Amsterdam. The burgers are perfect and the fries superb as well. Service is very good and very helpful. I guess during business times it can be very crowded. Highly recommend!
85,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely little place. Not too busy, not too quiet. Music was chilled, outdoor seating, inside was just as nice if not better. Needs more chicken burger options."
86,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,5 years ago,Don't bother... waited 15 mins for someone stop by my table with no luck.   If you claim to have the best burger you need have at least decent service.  Obviously your employees don't care about your customers.
87,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good burgers (good meat quality /still a little pricy) / sweet potatoes fries were good but some disappointments on the Parmesan chirros overall good experience
88,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Better avoid this one... Food is mediocre, not terrible, but service is quite chaotic and indifferent. It's very close to the canal, but that means you will share your meal with a number of wasps if you eat outside. Many better options in the area."
89,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice location. i was notbhungry afterwards butvthe burgers could have been better. the meat was awesome and a good quality. price and sauces (ellis special 2.0) were not special at all. still got a tasty average burger
90,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great burgers! We got the cheese and bacon and the blue cheese burger. I would have taken pictures but they smelled so good I couldn’t wait to dig in. The smell of those burgers didn’t lie!
91,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Edible burger (they say they are cooked 'medium' by default, but we got fairly overcooked ones), and fries tasted like they were frozen. Super pretentious place, and they have nothing to back it up. Meh."
92,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place but the service to order took very long time.  Good beer but thats everywhere in Amsterdam. Hard to find bad beer.  Burger was over averege and tasted good!
93,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious meal here, and vegetarian friendly menu. Home made fries, nice calm location. Affordable although getting pricey for a student budget, but it was worth it."
94,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Great location with tables on the canal. Fast and friendly service when we were there. Burgers were simple but very tasty. They even had corn on the cob!
95,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Food is good but the service is horrible. If it is a bit full get ready to wait for long time! The waitress/waiters dont take notes of your orders so expect them to forget stuff and that you have to remind them your order.
96,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent burgers, beer, and Belgian fries. We happened to come in the day that the special white bread toast was available, so I got a chicken sandwich, which was very good."
97,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Pretty good burger, but not mindblowing. Service was great and quick, the homemade lemonade definitely is recommendable. Pricing is pretty good for Amsterdam."
98,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Messed up my simple order. Did not apologize. And informed us one order was not in stock...but 20 minutes after taking the order! Kids menu was expensive for a very small portion, although taste was ok."
99,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We didn't have a burger here but the beer was good. They have tables right along the canal and it's a nice place to chill and have a beer.
100,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,I was waiting too much time for my burger and finally it was raw. Kind staff but unprofessional. Another client was complaining for delay of his delivery as i was there. Nothing special and expensive.
101,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,2 years ago,Worst burger I’ve had so far in Amsterdam. Expensive and not a good taste. I’d even say McDonald’s is better
102,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,I really like this chain of restaurants. Everything is crafted in a excellent way. The burgers are very tasty and the cheesecake is excellent. They should come to London!!
103,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is great, but the terrace needs parasols or other protection from bird droppings. Waiters wear annoying earpieces that seem to distract them too much to properly take orders"
104,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"The place for burger near touristic places but without the crowd.
The homemade Ice Tea Classic is one of the best in Amsterdam (and the homemade lemonade are very nice too).
I put 5 star (to be redundant)"
105,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Nice service, signature lamb burger was just ok. You would expect more from a 16,50 burger."
106,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Ok restaurant but to be honest the hamburgers are a bit overpriced and not that tasty, I was a bit disappointed. The service is good and the location is nice."
107,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic burgers and service! We went during off pew times and the service was fantastic. Order the Ellis 2.0, it’s sublime!"
108,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good food, nice atmosphere. Slightly limited menu. Staff varies: sometimes great, sometimes not so much. Definitely worth a visit."
109,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Thoroughly enjoyed our burgers and fries yesterday , I had the chicken burger and my wife had the salmon burger , quality fresh food and we would certainly return if back in Amsterdam again"
110,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great burgers.  Very friendly staff. The best coleslaw ive had in years!
111,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"As a food lover I had to try the Ellis Island burger. Sorry, but I'm not impressed. Price/quality wise....will not go there again."
112,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Ellis Gourmet Burger, like usual, nothing to said. One of the best of his kind. The only downside that I can find is the price, maybe a bit expensive (45€ for two I would said.)"
113,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible over priced food and made the whole table get food poisoning.  Do not recommend, taste going up was probably better than it going down."
114,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Burger was decent, choice of beer a bit lackluster, and too little waiting staff. Not bad, but there are definitely better burger options."
115,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We loved the food although a bit surprised we couldn't get a burger without a side dish.
116,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Me and my mate always enjoy a burger when traveling and personally I would highly recommend Ellis Gourmet Burger if you're in Amsterdam, great burger and lovely staff!"
117,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Last munchies with their gourmet burger ✌🏻
118,Ellis gourmet burger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst client experience ever...
Can't say more without being impolite.
Let's just say we waited 1h and left... without eating anything and being talked to inappropriately  by the waitress"
119,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great variety of burgers, starters, salads and desserts. If you are into gourmet burgers, this is a place worth trying"
120,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The burgers are good, but definitely NOT the best burgers in town. That said, the service is very prompt and good and so is the location."
121,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I usually never rate restaurants on Google but the food was so good that I felt I have to. Additionally, the service crew is very friendly and accommodating."
122,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I haven’t found a good burger in Amsterdam and I was really hoping this would change this. Unfortunately, it did not. The meat is still over cooked and over worked."
123,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The Meal was very delicious! I don't know a place in the Netherlands, where burgers smells better. :)"
124,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Average Burger - Go find a real homemade burger!  Made for tourists.. service was non-interested (multiple servers)
125,Ellis gourmet burger, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"FYI, didn't actually eat here, so can't really rate.  But if you're a family of four and you want to share two hot chocolates, it's against the rules, and you'll just have to leave."
126,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place with amazing burgers and friendly staff.
Hope i come here again soon for some tasty burgers."
127,Ellis gourmet burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great location on the canal, and very nice staff, but the blue cheese burger didn't have enough cheese and the burger was bland."
128,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,While on vacation In my favorite city amd wandering the street I found this lil adorable burger place.  I wanted to sit outside and take in the views but sadly the patio was closed.
129,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, very central, friendly service, the hamburger gets 4 out of 5 stars to my taste but overall the place earns 5 stars!"
130,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great portobello sandwich! Nice interior, clean bathrooms, great staff. The sidewalk seating is great when the weather permits."
131,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,6 years ago,We went to eat dinner and the burgers were lekker! nice terrase and quick chaf! i love this place will go back there for sure

133,Ellis gourmet burger, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really nice combinations of ingredients, great beef, crazy staff (but in a really good way) and big portions of fries. Couldn't ask for anything else."
134,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great burgers! We are now reoccurring customers. Really tasty and worth the price!
135,Ellis gourmet burger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The most meat tasting vegan burger I have ever had. Good service, good prices"
