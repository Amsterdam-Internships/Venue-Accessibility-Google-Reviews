Also it is cool that they had early Friday with a discount of you come before 17:00. One hour was enough for us to enjoy our dinner and dessert. Kids friendly. I would go there again."

27,Vandaag, 1 star ,a year ago,"Was good before Corona but now its not the same anymore, the worst part is that no one told us the system is totally different when we called and made the reservation, they just surprised us after we sat at the table that there's no buffet ‚Ä¶"

29,Vandaag, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food, great that there's a lot you can ask the chefs to cook especially for you such as steak and seafood. Almost lost a star because its very dark inside and the place wasn't as clean as you'd hope for but we did go at the very end of the day so can't fault anyone for that. Would recommend!"
30,Vandaag, 5 stars ,a year ago,This was a very good restaurant. They have a wide variety of options to choose from. All the options in the menu was there. Food is very tasty. The interior is very comfortable and cozy. The staff was very friendly and helpful
31,Vandaag, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty good food but the kids area is not really working most of the time machines brake and cant even win tickets at the others that do. And l must say I‚Äôm not fond of the magic show where my plates with perfectly good food disappear. Anyway food is good enough so if you want to go out with ur family then its an ok spot.
32,Vandaag, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A great concept and okay price. The food is mediocre. Drinks and desserts are alright. The sheer amount of food and choice is fantastic. So if your party all want different cuisines in the same sitting this is your safest bet.
33,Vandaag, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"All you can eat, reserve time and group size. Good for team outings/celebrations. Food is tasty and varied. Kid's menu. Drinks included in the price, pay extra for strong alcoholic drinks."

39,Vandaag, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"It's a good concept (all you can eat and drink for 2 hours for a fixated prize) but the food is far from the prize. The sushi is soggy and not well done but I really love their dessert buffet, That's actually all I have been eating there. ‚Ä¶"
40,Vandaag, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Love it. I can not eat gluten so I asked for extra information and I got a tour from the chef. He explained me what can I have and what not. They have gluten free and lactose free ice cream as well. The staff is friendly and always ready to answer questions.

45,Vandaag, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"EVERYTHING they served was very tasteful fresh and or baked on demand. They have all kinds of food. Loved the deserts and brown/white chocolade fontsins. For kids there is a separate kids corner, they can make or prepair food themself. There is a flatfee at the entrance, it includes 2 hours of food and drinks."
46,Vandaag, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Worst customer service ever! We were more of a nuisance in the eyes of the staff (incl the head of floor) when we asked to be seated at one table rather than the two they had for us or when I asked for my broken (!) chair to be replaced. At ‚Ä¶
47,Vandaag, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Disappointing experience.  Went here with 18 colleagues,  which this place can house easily.  A lot of the food was cold or dried out.  And the vegetarian dishes and allergens were not displayed properly.  They have proper signs but these were often not filled up or placed incorrectly."
48,Vandaag, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A restaurant where you can eat an all-inclusive diner bifet with life cooking. Friendly staff and good food, the food is not of very high quality but it is tasty and very payable. Also there is a special Kidskitchen with good for the youngones among us."
49,Vandaag, 2 stars ,5 years ago,What an awful place to eat! The food is very low quality with not much taste. The wine that I tried was literally the worst wine I ever had in my life. The only reason why I`m not leaving a 1 star rating is the free entrance on your birthday.
