0,Pluk, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Great decor, atmosphere and music. Dining in is very tight for the space available but they had great food. It's also self-service so you have to first get a table and then go back downstairs to order."
1,Pluk, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"This place is about cute atmosphere, but not for good food and drinks. Everything looks very photogenic, but not tasty :(
Hope next time I‚Äôll change my mind about it! Maybe the order wasn‚Äôt the next"
2,Pluk, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very delicious latte (good quality coffee), the pancakes were not dry and had a great amount of fresh fruits. Very good for the price!"
3,Pluk, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very nice atmosphere, even though it was a little crowded ! ‚ò∫Ô∏è I really enjoyed my brunch there, we ordered eggs norwegian and poke salmon toast. Their apple pie is so yummy! üíï very nice staff too ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
4,Pluk, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"We ordered the pancakes and a chicken bowl. The pancakes were tasty, but the fruits on top were not all cleaned, like the kiwi was sliced, full of chocolate syrup but the skin still on... same was for the passionfruit. ‚Ä¶"
5,Pluk, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Pluk has a very cosy atmosphere, almost akin to a dolls‚Äô house :)
I‚Äôve seen a large display of options for bot sweet-lovers and not. I went for a salmon and avocado sandwich, English breakfast tea, ginger shot: all delicious. ‚Ä¶"
6,Pluk, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Disposable cups for all guests in 2021: seriously? Apart from that super dirty and sticky tables which nobody cleans. Looks awesome but exierence is soso ‚Ä¶ my recommendation: take a look and leave for another place closeby.

Dont order a cappuccino. This is one of the worst cappuccino‚Äôs ever and the girl ‚Ä¶"

9,Pluk, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Super delicious food. Nice atmosphere. Awesome employees! 100% recommendation to go there if you visit amsterdam!
10,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,"It‚Äôs weird that you can‚Äôt order while seated, and it‚Äôs not really common knowledge when you arrive. So you instead stand there looking a bit confused until you realise you‚Äôre supposed to go upstairs. The bagel was great, except the fresh ‚Ä¶"
11,Pluk, 2 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Cannot recommend. Very overpriced and poor quality (apart from, admittedly, the cinnamon roll, which was so-so). The girls behind the counter were friendly, except for one older woman working there (perhaps owner/manager) for whom we were ‚Ä¶"
12,Pluk, 3 stars ,a year ago,Another Instagramable place which attracts your attention with its pictures. But when will these places start making good tasting food and deliver nice service? That is the main question. It‚Äôs quite pricy and for ‚Ç¨5 for matcha latte they ‚Ä¶
13,Pluk, 3 stars ,a year ago,Very good coffee and breakfast was delicious. We ordered the french toast (highly recommended) and Norwegian benedict eggs.  Only downside would be that you have to bring your own drinks upstairs and  clear your table after. Waiting time was ok.
14,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there on a Saturday and was pretty busy in the store. The dining service is bit confusing. There‚Äôs a so called waiting list for the table upstairs. But it‚Äôs not table service in the store, you order at the bar and bring part of your ‚Ä¶"
15,Pluk, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Acai bowl is awesome. Tumeric latte was kinna new to me but overall good. You need to order/pay the food downstairs before seated and the staff will serve to your table. The toilet is located in the basement, nice and clean."
16,Pluk, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"This is such a quaint and cozy place, but go early as it gets busy on weekends! We loved our upstairs seating with a great view below and outside, and the decor is classy and relaxing. We did have to wait a while for our cappuccinos, and ‚Ä¶"
17,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super cute place with tons of character! My wife loved her French toast and I really enjoyed my avocado toast. Delicious place to grab a coffee and a quick bite! It can get really busy and it can be difficult to find a table at times.
18,Pluk, 1 star ,a month ago,The worse service I have ever experienced in my life. It‚Äôs just one of those hyped brunch locations with overly priced plain food. I will never come back here
19,Pluk, 1 star ,a month ago,"We came on Friday. Incredible drinks (ice salted caramels).

We came on Sunday (today). Only sugar, syrup, undrinkeable. Like an actual ‚Ä¶"
20,Pluk, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Cool ambience & concept but absolutely horrible food. Hard bread that isn‚Äôt toasted, bland creations, & bad service. For Amsterdam and the price, this place should be superior but it falls far below. It is not hard to make a good avocado toast or poke bowl."
21,Pluk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Nice cakes and good pouched eggs. Dog allowed which is cool. Service in general was terrible though. There is little space upstairs but u have to go order downstairs and turned out that have to pay also in front so don‚Äôt forget your wallet. ‚Ä¶
22,Pluk, 3 stars ,a month ago,"Very cute place, very famous in Amsterdam.
But the food was not really good and the service aswell, you have to take your own drinks ..... ‚Ä¶"
23,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love this little gem - it is definitely geared towards a younger blogger crowd :) it's beautifully decorated and the food tastes as good as it looks. ‚Ä¶
24,Pluk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"They have indeed really good brunch which is highly recommended, coffee was okay. The cafe sells some amazing cups and little stuff. While it has really tiny stairs where only allowed one person passed, and customers should bring their ‚Ä¶"
25,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love this place. Definitely the place for instagrammers!

Breakfast smoothie bowls were great as were their coffee and cakes. Lovely ‚Ä¶"
26,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It‚Äôs a beautiful Hot spot in the middle of old Amsterdam. All Food is freshly and organic handmade. Cakes are - WOW - made with LOVE. Ideal place for breakfast - Lunch - Coffee
27,Pluk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, but unfriendly service and long waiting time. The girl who is responsible for the waiting list was super rude, seemed to be very stressed and couldn't really handle all customers. I understand that there is a hype for this very ‚Ä¶"
28,Pluk, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Horrible experience. I‚Äôve been looking forward to visit and try their French toast for a long time already (it‚Äôs always so busy and they don‚Äôt take reservations, making it hard to find the perfect time to visit) ‚Ä¶"
29,Pluk, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Service disaster....

Came in asked for a table and got that. Separated but still okay. ‚Ä¶"
30,Pluk, 2 stars ,3 months ago,Really disorganised customer service. 5 people on the till and I still  had no clue what was going on. No signs or instructions to help customers understand the ordering system either. The vegan chocolate cake I had was nothing special either.
31,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The service is horrible!
There is no structure on the service part, people wait in line to get a table, then they sit there and nothing happens because no one told them to order at the ‚Ä¶"
32,Pluk, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Overrated place. We entered, all the food on the counter was uncovered, staff and people talking over it (you can imagine all the dropplets the food receives during all the day of being there uncovered), this is extremely unhygenic. The ‚Ä¶"
33,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I feel people mostly go here for the Instagram pics! I mean that‚Äôs why I went lol. And yes you do get the cute pics but I wouldn‚Äôt say it was my fav restaurant. Food was ok. Customer service could be better. My advice: get there early because it does get packed.
34,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I can‚Äôt give it five stars because the place is inefficiently run which causes queues and delays but if you‚Äôre not in a rush, it is lovely. The food on the two mornings we were there was great. I didn‚Äôt think I wanted raw salmon for breakfast but I really did."
35,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went for a coffee and to peruse the shop, and ended up staying for breakfast. The staff were friendly and helpful with explaining the ordering process (order at the counter, find a table and food is brought to your seat). The pancakes were ‚Ä¶"
36,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely spot, one of my favorite discoveries in the city! The food is a treat for the eyes and very tasty. The caf√© has a built-in shop with cute mugs, cards and other little gems. Would go back there anytime!"
37,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cutest breakfast spot (a√ßa√≠ bowls, juices, breakfast items). Service was a bit slow but efficient considering there were only 4 running it. Seating is upstairs and felt a bit tight during busy hours but totally fine once you‚Äôre sat down."
38,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice breakfast options - eggs benedict were really tasty. It's a self service - so you order the food at the register.
I also tried apple pie, but I wouldn't recommend it, it was okay, but just that ‚Ä¶"
39,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the poke toast and it was really good! My friend took the chicken toast and I think I have never seen such a big chunk of toast in my life!! The toasts will really fill you up. The staff is really friendly just the one minus point is that the floors are a bit dirty and the space is jammed pack, but hey, that's Amsterdam for you."
40,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A lot of the menu options where unavailable, also very busy with limited seating and staff. But beautiful interior and well put together food. Very tasty though."
41,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cute interior and a good turmeric latte! I went by myself but I would definitely recommend going with friends since its seems to be more of a social cafe than one to just chill out at. But still a really lovely cafe!
42,Pluk, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Disappointing! Went there for brunch during the week. Americano was watery, Cappuccino was ok. We sat outside but the drinks were served in Paper cups. Had the Pancakes and Eggs Benedict with Ham on what was meant to be a Brioche. Brioche ‚Ä¶"
43,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautifully decorated place, well located and with tasty bakery. Staff is kind of immature (they were all very young and having a great time with each other but not properly attending to customers). It gets packed but we didn't have to wait long. It is a good place to eat and refill but there are better options close by."
44,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Pluk is definitely one of the best places in Amsterdam. Actually, I was on my way to another cafe, but as soon as I saw this cafe, it was so attractive that I went in and drank coffee right away. I don‚Äôt regret :) ‚Ä¶"
45,Pluk, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great variety of healthy options such as sandwiches with goat cheese, mushrooms and walnuts and tasty smoothies. The three stars are because during the preparation of the food the people working there don't wear gloves and touch food with bear hands."
46,Pluk, 1 star ,5 months ago,"I used to go to Pluk all the time before corona and it was great. However, a lot of things have changed since then. The quality of the food got really bad and portions got smaller. Service was not always good but the food was always ‚Ä¶"
47,Pluk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Plenty of healthy and yummy choices of sweet and savoury meals, desserts and drinks. The staff is lovely and happy to customise your order. I would absolutely go again once back in town for a healthy treat. ‚Ä¶"
48,Pluk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We are very disappointed, we got this recommendation from a friend and went here with high expectations. First we walked in - no sign of self service we got ignored by staff. We we were excited for our 10‚Ç¨ breakfast bowl - unfortunately ‚Ä¶"
49,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing place and great food, waitresses are nice and patient. My girlfriend and I had a really good time. We'll definitely come back during our trip to take a coffee!!"
50,Pluk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good coffee and selection of baked goods. Gorgeous little shop, with friendly staff. Love the boutique like atmosphere. Vegan and gluten free options available."
51,Pluk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great smoothie bowls and good place to go for a coffee or snack while shopping on the nine streets. There's limited seating so it can get really crowded at times. The shop upfront is super cute too.
52,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food service was fast despite being super busy. I'm new Zealand/australian so I'm fussy with brunch menus but they nailed it! So yum and such a nice vibe to the place
53,Pluk, 5 stars ,a year ago,I always visit this Cafe when in Amsterdam. The cakes are vegan and delicious and the eggs also! Very nice decoration
54,Pluk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice but the other Pluk down the road is a little nicer!

Unfortunately they‚Äôre busy with construction in the road so the vibe is a little ‚Ä¶"
55,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing lunch bowl and cake, it‚Äôs so delicious and perfectly flavoured. Love it. If I am coming back to Amsterdam again, this will be the reason."
56,Pluk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very good. Yes you have to order at the bar downstairs and walk up with your drinks on those tiny stairs but it's worth it.
57,Pluk, 1 star ,5 months ago,"It‚Äôs like that I am begging their for my food, my order took more than 35 min.

I understand that they maybe understaffed! What they can do is to minimize umber if tables"
58,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I m right here now :-) It was awesome place to rest while I walking on the street. And the staff was super great. Kind of sad there's no chance to come back here since I m a traveler! Thank you Pluk ya'all :)!
59,Pluk, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Cozy place! Nice food! However, the day I went there the place was crowded and the staff couldn‚Äôt handle everything! When they brought me the meal they forgot the fork and knives!"
60,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and presentation, but service is non-inviting and you have to wait 5-10 minutes to be seated. You have to order at the register aswell. Also pretty expensive, especially for drinks. Overall very good, but service makes the difference."
61,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to have a healthy snack. It‚Äôs tiny, but that gives it a nice touch. They also sell stuff with a unique twist. Very cool."
62,Pluk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"This location had TERRIBLE customer service and a questionable hygiene policy. The bowls were very pretty and tasted good, but my friend found two bugs in her bowl and some dirty stuff on her fruit. She told a staff member and the staff ‚Ä¶"
63,Pluk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Absolutely loved this breakfast cafe. The majority of the food is vegan friendly and I had the acai bowl (which was delicious) my friend had the eggs Benedict- which, as you can see looks (and was) amazing. Would definitely come here again. A lovely place with yummy food, coffee, juices and vibes."
64,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very cozy and charming place. The cakes looked very creative and fun. The pancakes tasted OK as expected but nothing special.
65,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best place in Amsterdam! Food, atmosphere, interior design, shopping point, everything.
You can buy great home accessories here!"
66,Pluk, 4 stars ,a year ago,I had an acai bowl and my friend the pancakes and it all tasted very good! The staff however was not so friendly and it took quite a while for the food to arrive..still would recommend the place is cozy.:)
67,Pluk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Enjoyed a great impromptu lunch here.  Still dreaming about the smoked trout sandwich.  Cozy, yet bright and airy setup with tables on the mezzanine.  Very affordable fare that will get any foodie excited.  Didn't get to try any of the pastries, but they looked delectable as well."
68,Pluk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I have had a very negative experience here in October 2018.

For starters, this is a very hip instagram'able place with vintage looking ‚Ä¶"
69,Pluk, 2 stars ,7 months ago,I expected a bit more to be honest. From the wonderful appetite creating photos on insta I was expecting matching flavours. ‚Ä¶
70,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cute place if you are into #interiorgoals. Feels a little crowded in busy times, but very nice feeling nonetheless. Portions are not that big unfortunately, but tasty. There goes one star for value for money."
71,Pluk, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Nice looking drinks but pricey! Atmosphere is okay and the staff is nice
72,Pluk, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Love the place. It‚Äôs super cute and insta worthy. The toasts are great so do the coffee.
73,Pluk, 1 star ,a week ago,"I had the pancakes and the poke salmon toast and both tasted like it was days old, not fresh at all."
74,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It is perfect. I went there spontaneously, but it‚Äôs jackpot. I ate brunch menu, a piece of quiche, fresh salad, two pieces of wheat bread and small croissant. It was included a orange juice and a coffee or tea. Too good for reasonable price. the atmosphere was very bright and lovely."
75,Pluk, 1 star ,2 months ago,Overpriced and very disappointing hot chocolates. You can definitely find better quality for nicer prices elsewhere.
76,Pluk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food and service here is horrendous. They are always in bad moods and act like it's a chore to do their job. Last time I was there for lunch my friend and I ordered poke bowls - the edamame was frozen, the rice was hard, the mango was ‚Ä¶"
77,Pluk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, loved the interiors with all the vegetables. We had a light breakfast - I took a fruit bowl which was delicious, while my partner enjoyed a wonderful carrot cake. Service was OK, definitely worth a visit üëå"
78,Pluk, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Perfect for Breakfast and Bruch! Great Location and atmosphere, with decently priced options."
79,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A beautifully curated space to enjoy breakfast & bakery items in downtown Amsterdam. Super fun and creative menu items. Very fresh. It's a tight space, so waiting time can be a bit long, plus waiting for seating/ordering food was a little ‚Ä¶"
80,Pluk, 5 stars ,a month ago,This place is amazing ! They have the best salmon and cinnamon rolls. Never tried better ! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
81,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fun breakfast. Get there early to avoid a line. The french toast was like...whoa.
82,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Small restaurant, so book it want to go! Great food. Good prices"
83,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice little shop / diner with the usual modern lifestyle food. Nice waitresses and great assortment of cakes.
Definitely a good place for a rest during a city stroll."
84,Pluk, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely store but overpriced food that's not special or very tasty.
The service is friendly but unbelievably slow and it‚Äôs a hazard carry your own drinks up those steep steps ‚Ä¶"
85,Pluk, 3 stars ,a year ago,"ordinary brunch place, be aware there is a miss kitty"
86,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very friendly staff, beautiful food and so many cute things to buy. Lovely place!"
87,Pluk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Really good and healthy place. I enjoyed eating in here. The juice was fresh and the pancakes where delicious. I recommend this place. You must try it when you come to Amsterdam
88,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy atmosphere, great food and service!"
89,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A lovely little place to have brunch! My boyfriend and I had breakfast here and we thought it was lovely. Such a simple concept but done incredibly well. The food was simple but deliciously and presented beautifully. The staff were all ‚Ä¶

92,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Definitelly the better one Pluk from those two Pluks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We tried some food. It was good, nothing special, but it really looked good, instagram worthy.
Staff also disorganised - they ask you about your name and where you sit while ‚Ä¶"
93,Pluk, 1 star ,7 months ago,"I like the concept, it sounds nice and what I read is that the Pluk was much better a year ago. Now I can‚Äôt get an Orange juice, don‚Äòt know why because the Oranges are next to the Entrance. To basically every costumor they say sorry we ‚Ä¶"
94,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely little seating area to have a relaxing breakfast. Staff are extremely friendly and kind. The food is delightful and very well presented. Would recommend this place to anyone who visited Armsterdam

96,Pluk, 5 stars ,a year ago,Beautiful place with real good food and coffee..
97,Pluk, 1 star ,8 months ago,"I ordered Eggs Norwegian which is basically eggs Benedict on smoked salmon and toasts. First of, the toasts weren‚Äôt even toasts. They were stale and tasteless. The smoked salmon was not fresh at all. Last but not least, the poached eggs ‚Ä¶"
98,Pluk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The distressed-cottage look to this place is cute and the scrumptious cakes, viennoiseries and beverages will give you a cozy, homemade feel. The free miniature stroopwafels and marshmallows are a nice touch. Seating is quite limited."
99,Pluk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cute place to stop and have a quick special something, like my Unicorn breakfast. Very tasty indeed. Service with a smile allowing you to feel cosy with a delightful atmosphere."
100,Pluk, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Nice atmosphere, food looks good but the taste of vegan pastries is completely on the low side. My vegan lemon cake tasted like plain sugar and fat, not a note of lemon:( Will not come again."
101,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious and healthy food which looks as good as it tastes üòä
102,Pluk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice and friendly stuff - great store and the food was amazing

104,Pluk, 5 stars ,a year ago,Such a nice restaurant with friendly staff! The dishes were so delicious! I would pay a visit again
105,Pluk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst. They will put your name in waiting list, but random ppl will still walk inside and take your seat. Be sure that all the flys you see indoor were sitting on your food. Oh, btw, later they will ask to order at the till, so you go back again and wait another 20 mins... Couldn't finish my meal, tastes very bad."
106,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good foods. Cosy place, decorations are nice. Prices are a bit high. Waiters are kind but the service is slow."
107,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good vibe and some excellent apple pie make this place worth a visit.

110,Pluk, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"the place was so cute, but the food was no the perfect combination."
111,Pluk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Brownies was not tasty. The toilet are dirty ans also the Open kitchen! Apple pie was goon and also the chai latte.
112,Pluk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasty, hearty goodness. Really nice decor and layout. We had super tasty soup & a really nice salad. Great to stop off & refuel during your day of walking and site seeing"
113,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cute little cafe perfect for brunch and other food is amazing. If you love avocado you should try avocado bread.
114,Pluk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely spot for coffee, brunch, lunch or afternoon tea and sweets ü•ûüíï They have a little shop too, where they sell trendy items great for gifts. Would come back anytime"
115,Pluk, 2 stars ,6 months ago,its look good but unfortunately  they don't have good menu only smoothie and some desert I was hoping for real good breakfast
116,Pluk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Gezeilig place as dutch people say. The coffee and food is really good. I ordered the carrot cake üç∞ and it was delicious üòã
117,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Casual cafe, cool decor and atmosphere, cakes and coffee where good, homemade feel."
118,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,small cafe but with a good taste and good ambience. Come here for brunch and i picked the carrot cake which is so delish and so melted on your mouth ‚ù§Ô∏èüëåüèª when i came there wasnt a spot inside Because they‚Äôre already full but the staff so helpful by come to us and tell us if there‚Äôs a spot inside
119,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a very nice breakfast spot, a lot of variety. The location is right by the Canal and Easy to find, the venue looks amazing. Really cozy."
120,Pluk, 2 stars ,a month ago,the chai latte was so disgusting i almost threw up. and overpriced of course but for what?
121,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Five stars for the food. But seating area is horrible - very cramped and not for tall people. But yet - food very yummy
122,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Kind of pricey and the smoothie bowls were too liquidy but cute place!
123,Pluk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Just happened to pass by and was attracted by the decor and how busy they were.  Though not big, it is kind of cute and bright.  Ordered a latta, it was reasonable!"

125,Pluk, 3 stars ,a year ago,Yesterday my family and I were at Pluk for breakfast and were a little disappointed. The actual space is very charming and cute but the service and food was underwhelming. My mother ordered the avocado toast and there was a very tiny bit of ‚Ä¶

Nice staff
Must to try guys  in Amsterdam üòçüëçüèª"
133,Pluk, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Staff was very rude and ill-mannered to me any time I was requiring assistance. Ice Tea was good.
134,Pluk, 1 star ,3 months ago,Really bad matcha and chai latte completely overpriced but the place is cute
135,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful cafe, in a great location in Amsterdam. If I could I would replicate it in Brighton."
136,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,really lovely brunch spot in a hip area
137,Pluk, 1 star ,8 months ago,"The most rude and unprofessional staff I've seen. The attitude you get from the staff is like you've dropped over unannounced at their home, asking for a coffee. And to call their coffee mediocre would be a stretch..Just move along and look elsewhere as there are plenty of other options in the area."
138,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fancy thought through food for reasonable price. Great ambience there!
139,Pluk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Place looks nice with pretty interior. When we went there on a Saturday morning it was about the best thing about the place. You sit very close to all other people, with barely space to walk to your spot. Coffees were decent, food ok but ‚Ä¶"

145,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food was really nice although the poke bowl was a bit cold. Would be better at room temperature. The place is cozy and they offer tables down and upstairs. One thing to take into consideration is that it is a self serving restaurant. ‚Ä¶

158,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Quite a wait getting in (30mins) but not their fault at all that it‚Äôs a popular place to go for breakfast.

167,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very insta worthy place with colorful dishes and cozy interior. The Bali Bowl and mint tea was good, but i expected more for that price. Tables are unstable and the staff could be better at handling busy periods."
168,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I took a breakfast here, usually I love this kind of place. The food looks beautiful but was not very tasty. My unicorn bowl and my chai latte was just OK. However my fianc√©'s pancakes were great."

174,Pluk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Pluk intrigued us because it's got a very cool and consistent theme and decor (albeit quite girly) but unfortunately the coffee and cake was not all that great. My lemon and poppyseed cake looked soo good and then it turned out horribly dry!
175,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The food was mediocre! And the place was beautiful!
176,Pluk, 1 star ,a year ago,"Atmosphere is nice. Food is average. Pricy. The tables are not clean! No service at all! We suppose to bring our own drinks upstairs but food was brought to table, not sure why."
177,Pluk, 2 stars ,a year ago,"The food is very good and the place is cosy, which deserves a 5 stars. Too bad the service is deplorable ! The order did not correspond to my choice and the waitress added a few ingredients with these fingers. Amazing !!! Especially in these times of coronavirus!"
178,Pluk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice interior... good coffee. However, if you‚Äôre looking for good quality, tasty, genuine food, sadly this is not the place. The juices aren‚Äôt freshly made, carrot pumpkin soup tastes nothing like the name it was given, and the bread doesn‚Äôt have any taste at all. :("

180,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Cute place, staff were polite but service wasn't the best. Looks better on Instagram than real life, but still a cute place to go. Food looked incredible!!!"
181,Pluk, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place with good food but the waiters seemed not bothered. A bit strange you have to carry your drinks up the super steep steps. Definitely not handicap friendly. Cool and yummy looking  cakes. B

Additionally, they were taken from a big container inside a fridge , which makes me wonder whether they were even made today. Really disappointing experience. I have been to so many good places in Amsterdam, and this one was not a place to visit again."

189,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is one amazing concept. The girls who work there are always super friendly with a great smile Especially Sihen, Char and Chawila. They give you the best service and always make time for a quick conversation. The only thing is that it‚Äôs hard to get a place to sit sometimes. Because the quality is so good on weekend is super busy!"
190,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Their service is not the best - sometimes slow and inattentive. Plus having to go downstairs to order is not the most practical thing. However the food and the drinks are always delicious and picture  and their sweets are mouthwatering and ‚Ä¶

192,Pluk, 1 star ,a year ago,"Bad service experience, never received my order. I give the second star just because the second waitress was kind enough to apologies and refund my money (still waiting to see them on my bank account tho). UPDATE: changed to 1star since I never received my money back."
193,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Ambience is really nice with cute decorations and a warm feeling. The dessert selection at the front looked good but didn‚Äôt try any as it‚Äôs not my thing. Went there for the brunch and it was decent but could have been better. The coffee wasn‚Äôt great, pretty weak."
194,Pluk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Unfriendly and overpriced.
They have self-service but that doesn‚Äôt mean the staff has to be arrogant and unfriendly. Food looks nice but doesn‚Äôt have nice flavors. Would not recommend!"
195,Pluk, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent cakes, good cappuccino, beautiful interiors. I don't give 5 stars because there is not service at the table, the guest need to bring the stuff to his table on the first floor with difficult stairs, and because is expencive l would like to recive this service"
196,Pluk, 1 star ,a year ago,"Food was good but service terrible, had to clean our own table before eating, waitresses where really really rude, overall would not recommend.

199,Pluk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"A very uncomfortable, overrated place with rude employees that don't really care whether you find a seat or not and food that is more for garnish and visual presentation rather than taste and enjoyment. This place plays the social media ‚Ä¶"
200,Pluk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice fresh juices, average coffee (they didn't make cappuccino correctly) and breakfast options. Overall focus on healthy foods"
201,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The place is very nice and the food was pretty much good too. I had pancakes and I loved them but my fianc√©'s tried the Unicorn Bowl and found it not very tasty.

202,Pluk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Ambiance is great and place looks very cute but the staff makes the experience very bad. Very unfriendly, everything seems too much for them. 2 hours before closing time we were only able to order sandwiches from the menu (leaving out 80% ‚Ä¶"
203,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Pluk is definitely one of the best places and blogger destinations in Amsterdam. It is such a lovely modern and fashionable cafe with their little shop on the side. As it is a popular spot we waited in line about an hour to get seated. But ‚Ä¶
204,Pluk, 1 star ,4 years ago,Beautiful place and good location but thats it. Service is very poor. Plenty of staff but no one is ready to assist you. Staff does not know what the ingredients. I would not recommend this place or return.
205,Pluk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We had coffee and cake. The carrot cake didn‚Äôt have walnuts, which I missed üòî. Just a personally preference! And the coffee was ok. Service was average, even though we were seated we had to wait at the counter to bring our food to the table."
206,Pluk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Enjoyed the acai bowl a bit busy due to it's social media appeal.
207,Pluk, 1 star ,a year ago,"Disappointed of that service. We have waited 15 min to order because they didnt tell us that we had to order at the desk.
We have to make our own service (drinks). ‚Ä¶"
208,Pluk, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Been here a few times before, before they started expanding. Used to be very good, used to be quality. Today what I was served was a waste of money. First a smoothie that only had the yoghurt flavour, then I exchanged it for a orange juice ‚Ä¶"
209,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Hard to get a seat and not very obvious what to do if you've not been before. Dragonfruit bowl and eggs Benedict were very nice and service was pretty good. They also sell mugs and jewellery etc on the side.
210,Pluk, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Very overrated place, food is ok coffee is average and the cakes/treats are only ok - definitely better places for food & coffee! But the space is cute!"
211,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Very white and clean and small. Food was good. We sat in the attic which was not a bad experience, but there was no view. The place lacked authenticity. To me it felt like young millennials cool hang-out place."
212,Pluk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Prices are way too high and my cake was dry and old. People behind the bar were quite nice, but the self service (to the point of clearing your own table) and many tables squeezed together makes you think this place is only about a high ‚Ä¶"

214,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Everything was fine. The Location is unfortunately a bit small, but very cozy."
215,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place to take a brunch/breakfast. It is kinda Instagram place a little bit too crowded to me and loosing some charm then.
Food was good and well presented. We ate there very well"
216,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food but the service is terrible. The waitresses don't make any effort to be nice, they look really bored. There is a lot of people coming anyway so they think their attitude doesn't matter. Plus they are not organized at all."
217,Pluk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Cozy spot with sweet treats.
218,Pluk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Went there Sat noon, don‚Äôt recommend. The food tastes great, athmosphere is okay and such but.. The portions were rather small, gluten-free options are quite limited and their system just don‚Äôt work: Super long queue, mostly only one person ‚Ä¶"
219,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Me and my girlfriend went to Pluk for a cup of coffee and to grab something to eat. The coffee was 10/10 and the breakfast was super tasty! Love the place and we‚Äôre definitely coming back!
220,Pluk, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very tasty sandwich, however the Glowing Green juice was pretty tasteless and was not freshly made. The service wasn't great either: the brunette who looked after me was rather cold, the blonde instead kept nibbling at the cakes for sale."
221,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,So cute! Felt like eating in the upstairs of an Anthropologie. Breakfast was delicious and came quick. Super friendly waitresses and hot coffee drinks. Wish this was somewhere I could go on my own every week on a Saturday !
222,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent food and drinks. We had lunch here 3 times already and every time the quality remained. Only drawback to this place is that it has a limited amount of space and it can get busy around lunch time so you might need to wait for someone to leave.

225,Pluk, 1 star ,2 years ago,Ordered the only vegan option on the menu and they'd ran out... it was lunch time. Rude staff that dont clean tables. No mochas at all. No chocolate milkshakes. Hope it closes down soon. Over priced waste of space on an otherwise decent Amsterdam high street...

Good taste for Instagram
Bad taste for your mouth"

Totally recommend this place !"
231,Pluk, 1 star ,2 years ago,The restaurant has mediocre food and the service is some of the worst I‚Äôve ever received. The people are beyond just mean - a friend of mine needs gluten free and they made her wait for 15 minutes and then didn‚Äôt do anything. And the food isn‚Äôt good enough to make up for it. Avoid if you can
232,Pluk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,This is the place to come for taking a picture of your food and post it on your social media. More than that hard to find. It is very busy and very small so it is very uncomfortable. When you are there you feel you are just in the middle. ‚Ä¶

236,Pluk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice and cozy place with with great food. Definitely worth visiting but was crowded and staff was a bit unorganized
237,Pluk, 1 star ,4 years ago,Calling this establishment a caf√© is misleading.. It is little more than an Instagrammers pitstop. People are more interested in what the food looks like than how it tastes  which is actually very poor and over priced. Waitresses are rude ‚Ä¶
238,Pluk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I'm simply forwarding a great recommendation I got before my trip to Amsterdam. You won't be disappointed, the interior is gorgeous, the pastries and the smoothies are divine and you can even go back home with a little souvenir from this amazing place!"

246,Pluk, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Interior looks really nice and seems cosy. I ordered a Acai bowl. It was super tiny for the 9.90‚Ç¨ that I paid. Unfortunately, it even did not test like real Acai from brazil. Over priced and not great! But maybe the rest tasts better."

282,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The most coziest place I‚Äôve been so far In Amsterdam with many choices for Brunch and soft drinks! But it would be busy sometimes and have to wait on the line.
283,Pluk, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Nice place to have brunch
284,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The food was nice but there was a long wait and they didn't tell us until order that they had run out of most of the menu
285,Pluk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Not good for people of color

I wasn't sure what the process was for ordering breakfast and I saw different ‚Ä¶"
286,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The biggest obstacle of this place is actually finding a place. A bit inconvenient that you still need to come down the cash registrar to place an order. On the positive side, the location and the food was great."
287,Pluk, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"I love this caf√®
Nothing more I can say !"
288,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The perfect place to have breakfast in Amsterdam. Delicious cakes and desserts. Top taste and quality. I loved the carrot cake.
289,Pluk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Well... it could be a nice place if personnel learns how to smile and to answer questions in a friendly way. I‚Äôve ordered Pluck Paradise (!) bowl, mango is half frozen, rice is half raw. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll come back."
290,Pluk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Easy going and laid back cafe with simple fresh menu. Highly recommend a visit as it caters for all types of eater.
291,Pluk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Except of the slow service,dirty tables,7 euro for a cupcake.I am wondering how hygienic is to have cakes on a display without any cover, exposed to air ,hair, flies,people talking over them???.Definitely a no."
292,Pluk, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Very popular and seems to be always full. Wanted to go in for a cup of coffee one afternoon and the unbothered server informed me that I needed a reservation. Not worth it for me unfortunately. The shop is very cute though.
293,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Really cute place, with great sandwiches and sweets. The coffee is quite poor, so our experience as coffee lovers was less pleasant"
294,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Lot of Instagram hype about not much. Location is very nice and tastefully decorated but cakes were very dry. Self-service in a very small restaurant.
295,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is great, coffee as well, but it is a bit too expensive. Has a nice interior, but it's not comfortable especially if you're tall."
296,Pluk, 2 stars ,6 years ago,Personally I like this cafe and I enjoy the matcha latte! But their toilet is sooo dirty. It just doesn't add up with the whole store concept!!
297,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best breakfast ever! The pancakes and eggs Royal are amazing! Everything is
298,Pluk, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Seating is up on a mezzanine with beautiful beams. The food is delicious and the staff are friendly. Not much room inside so hope that there is space for you!
299,Pluk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Okay food but often slow service due to so much demand. Good breakfast menu or for cakes.
300,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The pancakes are so fluffy and yummy. The hot chocolate was amazing. Nice place cozy and girly atmosphere.
301,Pluk, 1 star ,2 years ago,I don't recommend. People is rude. The service is not included ( you need to pick up your order as in a fast food) and they even want to charge you 3.9‚Ç¨ for hot water!!!!!
302,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super delicious bowls and cakes. Lovely interior. This is also perfect if you're travelling solo.
303,Pluk, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is great - but service is really poor. Staff is unfriendly, they are arrogant to non-Dutch people (even if you are not tourist) and doesn't make you feel welcome."
304,Pluk, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great atmosphere, healthy food choices and friendly stuff! The food was delicious, even if a tiny bit pricey)"
305,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful place and nice people. I tried the matcha latte and it‚Äôs not very good, low cualitty. The spiced pumpkin oats there wasn‚Äôt very good either very thick and not much flavor. It‚Äôs not a complain just an evaluation to make it better always according to my taste of course."
306,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food
307,Pluk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,[For tea and cake only] Very interesting tea room and cafe they also sells gifts. Good range of teas and all the cakes look and taste home made. Some seating outside or inside on a mezzanine. Only let down was the lack of staff resulting in an unnecessary wait.
308,Pluk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It's a bit odd, but the cake was lovely and the shop decor was great. The latte wasn't really a latte which was a surprise, and the smoothie was bizarre."
309,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice staff & great food!
310,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Great option for breakfast üíü
311,Pluk, 1 star ,3 years ago,the worst cafe ever
312,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice food and well presented... but super busy, tight space and over priced. Also the vibe was total chaos. Don‚Äôt come if you are looking for a cozy, relaxed atmosphere."
313,Pluk, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Well thought interior, the food was good, no service whatsoever. The place felt super chaotic, untidy, with dirty tables. I didn't feel welcome and wouldn't go there again."
314,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,lovely little coffee shop with a beautiful feel. coffee is weak though so for coffee lovers who enjoy strong coffee get an extra shot in your cappuccino.
315,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cute place in the middle of Jordaan. Good bowls, cakes though are nothing special. A bit pretentious but still a nice spot for an afternoon break or a bunch."
316,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Stumbled across this lively organic cafe .Soup and rye bread , delicious"
317,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Famous place because of the Instagram and we try it... Regular coffee and  little high price because of the people attention. I want to try their sandwich with Avocado or Yougurt but I was full when I were there. 3-5 euro for coffee and 6-15 euro for breakfast per person.
318,Pluk, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of my fav brunch spots in Amsterdam. Best eggs Benedict, coffee, fresh juices and their Lemon vegan cake ü§§ delicious!"
319,Pluk, 1 star ,2 years ago,The opening hours was supposed to be 9 in the morning on Saturday...my friend went to the Pluk and the Service toled her they open at 11...10:45 we went there again. Place was full and i Could not imagine that they were opening at 11....hiw ‚Ä¶
320,Pluk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Fancy place with tasty food and drinks. You can find a lot of young and hip girls there üòâ
321,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Super sweet Caf√© with great food.
322,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Unbelievably good food and atmosphere!
323,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Great food but the stuff was impolite and not helpful.
324,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Really crowded, so it takes a while to get a table. It's a nice option to get something healthy to eat. A salad or bowl costs around 10 Euros.
Unfortunately our food didn't come out at the same time, so we sat there for 15 minutes, looking at our matcha bowl, while we waited for the salad to arrive."
325,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Eggs pandects, French toast, pancakes and everything else is super delicious!!"
326,Pluk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very cozy place with an amazing red violet cake! The only drawback is that all the tables are way too close to each other
327,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Caf√© is nice however pretty expensive for what it is. Salmon was good the yoghurt was quite simple. Music is pretty loud and not my style (wouldn‚Äôt recommend going with your boyfriend ;) ) service is ok
328,Pluk, 1 star ,a year ago,"If I could give zero stars, I would, because of the insanely unfriendly and arrogant service providers. We came by the shop 45 minutes before (!) the official closure time that is displayed on their window. They had their doors & windows ‚Ä¶"
329,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very cute place to take breakfast
330,Pluk, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Excellent coffee and a lovely shop. The cakes and hot chocolate were great too. Lovely ambiance.

332,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Just found this place near our hotel, FAB food"
333,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, mindful and super friendly service , very good location. They also open before 10 am, so check in and enjoy before shopping the nine streets."
334,Pluk, 1 star ,3 years ago,Believe all positive review about this restaurant are paid. This is one of the worst experience I had in Amsterdam. First of all they took the ‚Äúself service‚Äù concept to the maximum. It is fine if we need to order the food ourselves and ‚Ä¶
335,Pluk, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great hot chocolate for when you want to heat up during those cold winter shopping days in Amsterdam.
336,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious smoothie. Seems that they stop serving food after 4pm
337,Pluk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Terrible service, your standard local no-smile, ""apparently-rude-but-not-because-that's-our-way"" service. Rip-off lattes (tiny cup and terrible taste) and pretend 'cosy-chic' atmosphere. Order at the till. Portion sizes are your standard small dutch sizes and overpriced. Good luck."
338,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Cosy place but very disorganised. Service is not friendly. Quality of food is poor as a lot of dishes are not homemade.
339,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for breakfast or quick lunch , if you see a queue , don‚Äôt worry, it goes fast and you can order in advance!"
340,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy and nice. Delicious healthy food, friendly staff. Easily full on weekends."
341,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,It's a very hipster girly place to get breakfast. We went there at around 9.45 and it was packed. Almost no place to sit. The tables and chairs are so close together I couldn't get my knees behind the tables stem (which is normal in ‚Ä¶
342,Pluk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very trendy place. Ideal for brunch and healthy food. A bit expensive but worth the experience.
343,Pluk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very cool place with good food. I was expecting to get a bit more food for the price, but was overall happy with my experience."
344,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love Pluk!  There are 2, with a difference of 3 blocks. If there is no room in one, try the other but you should know is almost always full as there are small places and people really like them hahah"
345,Pluk, 1 star ,3 years ago,Food is ok and very ‚Äúinstagramable‚Äù but service is really bad. Not customer oriented place at all.
346,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Here they really strive to offer something special with great ingredients. keep it up! Look yourself - you will not be disappointed
347,Pluk, 1 star ,2 years ago,Terrible service and small portions
348,Pluk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy Coffee Place And Fun coffee-related objects to buy.
But I wish they replace their plastic Straws with some sustainable and environment friendly ones."

353,Pluk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Reaaaally cute place and tasty croissant! BUT the service was inexistent, we were the only customers waiting in front of 4 staff to decide who is on what duty today, let alone be talked to in a friendly and smiley type of way. Might also be ‚Ä¶"
354,Pluk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Not good, we waited for eggs and when they came they were not hot or runny so we asked for new eggs and she told us to wait and she will ask the chef, only for us to wait 15 minutes for one new egg."
355,Pluk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A bit expensive but the food is really good!
356,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,eggs bendedict and all different pancakes are great but smoothie bowls are way tinier than they look on pictures and on some dishes with bread there's lettuce without dressing on the side
357,Pluk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A basic in Amsterdam for a lunch or breakfast. Tasty food, nice and cosy atmosphere and super nice and charming people working there."
358,Pluk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Looks beautiful, cupcakes are great. So expensive, smoothies are v. Bland"
359,Pluk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Cozy place with good vegetarian options. Doesn't have a really big choice, but good for lunch and desserts."

361,Pluk, 1 star ,7 months ago,Unorganised staff and food was nothing special
362,Pluk, 5 stars ,a year ago,The cutest of coffee shops
363,Pluk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Ordered 2 pumpkin spice lattes. In the menu it says it is served with cinnamon and stroopwafel, but the girl put marshmallow on top instead and I needed to ask for the stroopwafel myself. Furthermore they didn't taste like pumpkin spice at all. Definitely not worth ‚Ç¨7. Lemon cake however was very good!"
364,Pluk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Everything was really tasty and they have a big variety of cakes ‚ù§
365,Pluk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I have so much to say about this ""famous"" place called Pluk Amsterdam (Berenstraat)
But I will try to keep it short by saying that despite the fact that the food ‚Ä¶"
