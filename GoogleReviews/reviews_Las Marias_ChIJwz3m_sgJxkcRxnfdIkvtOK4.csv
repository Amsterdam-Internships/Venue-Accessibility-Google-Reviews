0,Las Marias, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We came here for the second time during this trip on our last day in Amsterdam, it really deserved a second visit. Great authentic Pizza with a very friendly service. Overall a definite 5 stars."
1,Las Marias, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It was very nice outside looking place and my feeling changes even to be better after great alio olio pasta and bread with garlick butter, toilets nice and fresh, and waitress very kind and smiling thanks for nice dinner"
2,Las Marias, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The ambience was nice but too small. Food is overpriced. The pizza was thin, burned and I had a lot of flour on my plate. While holding my pizza, it broke into pieces because it was so dry. For that we waited 1 hour and almost starved. But the staff was funny, for that 1 star."
3,Las Marias, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We waited an hour for our food and the pizzas were thin, dry, half burned and there was too much flour. For that we payed 7‚Ç¨. The Spaghetti Carbonara were tasteless. The whole ""restaurant"" didn't have enough space inside so it wasn't enjoyable at all."
4,Las Marias, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty good pizza, very tight and cramped"
5,Las Marias, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"You can have better steak with same place somewhere else. The price you saw on the door, was the price without sauce for steak and French fries. If you wanna saucer, you have to add 3 euro on top of the price you saw on the door"
6,Las Marias, 1 star ,7 years ago,"A tasteless experience. We ate lasagna, tagliatelle with salmon and vegetarian spaghetti. The portion for spaghetti was larger than expected, whilst the tagliatelle would hardly have made a child full. Presentation was poor as the lasagna ‚Ä¶"

11,Las Marias, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"It looks cosy on the outside, but the food was simple. You could do better at home, also you pay 4,50 for a medium cola (that has been open so long that there were no bubbles left)."
12,Las Marias, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"I think that the other reviewer is just a picky prick. This place is good, and it's open late. The portions were generous and proportional to the prices."
