0,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"We had a good late brunch here. Definitely good for us with a starving tummy that they serve us the food immediately. The one that took the order and serve us was a good and cheerful waitress, but the other one that gave us the bill was a little bit off."
1,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,6 months ago,My bf and I went to this Breakfast Club on a weekday morning. There were only few people inside. When we arrived at the Restaurant the staff members both just looked at us. After couple of seconds of awkward silence I asked if we can just ‚Ä¶

10,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Really friendly place with a good buzz on the weekend. But the food is par-for-the-course breakfast and brunch fair. The chicken waffle, for example, was not that flavourful - about on level with what one could whip up at home on a lazy ‚Ä¶"

12,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Always a great (and safe) choice for a cozy weekend brunch. Very vibing with good tasting food and drinks. I've had the pancakes and seaside eggs benedict and got nothing to complain about. ‚Ä¶
13,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,4 months ago,The food was delicious but the service was horrible. You had to order several times to finally get all your stuff and had to wait way too long for your food. The waitresses rather drink their tea and chat with each other than giving you ‚Ä¶

15,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,a month ago,"Hamburger was dry and cold, the egg looks like it was made in the morning. The bread of the club sandwich was terrible, sauce not flavourable. Service was friendly but the food wasn't good."

17,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Bottom line up front: GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR BREAKFAST. All the food we‚Äôve had in Amsterdam have been good and this was the only place with very bad service. We got served our drinks, but ignored for almost an hour and didn‚Äôt even get to ‚Ä¶"
18,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,a year ago,The food was really good. They also have good vegan options. I had the vegan pancakes and they were good but would‚Äôve like a little bit more fruit. My friend had the Mexico City. It tastes good too but was a little bit too expensive for the amount of food. The service was great.
19,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,4 months ago,Very slow service. Eggs Benedict did not have the Hollande sauce! The breakfast burger the worst I have ever had! Coffee was cold by the time it arrived on the table. Croutons too big in the Caesar salad! They need to up their game!! Very disappointing.
20,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is great, tasty and good quantity. The chai latte is very good too!

Maybe, the only thing why it's not a 5 stars is that the service was a bit ‚Ä¶"
21,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Really don‚Äôt recommend. The service was incredibly rude and not motivated. Our eggs Benedict was completely over cooked and when we asked to get them redone, the response was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how it is‚Äù. Very disappointing, especially for the price. There are so many better brunch places in Amsterdam!!!"
22,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Carrot cake was delicious, staff could at least pretend to enjoy their work. Bas in the music was too high up which is annoying when you try to talk to someone. The staff also throws around the dishes and closes the cupboard doors so hard it startles many customers. You get a blank expression when you mention it."

28,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,6 months ago,I have been to multiple ones and they been als fine. But this one wow. Slow service/ unprofessional service. They let the plates stand on the table next to us for soo long that the pigeons started having a fest. We got our food but no ‚Ä¶

31,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good for one time breakfast ü•û
32,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Some of the worst service I‚Äôve ever received. Took them an hour and a half to get me a cappuccino. The barista was rude to me and pretended like I was wrong for wanting a refund on the coffee. Food was good but not worth the wait.

Me: ""Is it possible to add onions?"" ‚Ä¶"
34,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Everything very nice, but the lady in charge (the oldest one with short hair) is not treating her staff very well and also very impolite to the customers. They should fire her"
35,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect spot for breakfast! Many options! Sweet and salty, the eggs benedict looks awesome, the pancakes a little tasteless but compensated with the fruit (banana, strawberries and berries), the red juce is tasty!
Carrot cake has way too much icing in my opinion!"

39,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The breakfast club is conveniently located and has a wide selection of food and drinks. We opted for the pancakes and the house Iced tea. The pancakes looked very nice but tasted mediocre - I have had way better. I didnt love the iced tea ‚Ä¶

44,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,7 months ago,"It took 1 hour and 42 minutes to get our food and they forgot all the extras that I had paid for. When it arrived it was luke warm, The sausage was a dutch rookworst and not a breakfast sausage. All in all a totally unimpressed experience ‚Ä¶"

Food was actually pretty good, but really wouldn't recommend going here though - it's touch and go whether you'll actually receive your order"
66,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The location and service was good, but food far below the expectations. The chicken waffle was really hard and chewy."
67,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cute spot. We went twice just because of the honey comb butter they use on the New York pancakes. üí¶

86,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious breakfast done a little differently. There's lots of seating inside however it is little cramped when it's busy.

99,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Food is nice, but unfortunately very very bad service.

115,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,Service is the worst I‚Äôve ever seen in Amsterdam.  Annika is impatient and unhelpful from the very first moment we sat when she ignored us and every time we asked for service over 20 minutes she told us to wait. Even when we got to order ‚Ä¶

126,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice location and nice seating outside. Staff was friendly and efficient and the pancakes was really good but could do with some more maple syrup and had some dry bits. Fruit with it was fresh and good
127,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The pancakes we ordered were very delicious (the fluffy kind). Three stars because prices are quite high for the amount of food you get (‚Ç¨11.- for small stack of pancakes), and it took the staff a very long time to notice and help us."

138,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Super nice interiors and drinks (juice and coffee) but very disappointing food. I ordered the California Eggs Benedict and it was very dry with hardly any hollandaise sauce - we had to ask for butter because it was just plain bred with some lettuce, tomato slices and hardboiled eggs on top."
139,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I pass this place by everyday as it's around the corner from my flat. It's lively and attracts a cool crowd. Once I had a coconut cappuccino there and I didn't want to come back. Maybe food is better.
140,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was very nice. The restaurant is nicely decorated, but maybe a little understaffed. We waited long to get our breakfast, we missed napkins for the entire stay and we asked for some milk for a tea, and never got to us. The wait was honestly a little long."

143,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Very average the food is not that good and the service is not good
144,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Big deception on the BLT which was just a super thick slice of bread topped with 3 tomato slices and dry bacon ... the Mexico City looked very unappealing and messy to eat .. fries were frozen.. I like the atmosphere but will stick to coffee if I go there!
145,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,Breakfast club is one of the best. I repeat the best in UK. In UK. So I thought the same thing of the Breakfast club here in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶
146,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Waited 15 minutes before being seated at the seat which had been empty the hold time, then took 30 minutes for order to arrive, and was not fully cooked. Then when coming to pay, there was one person I was with who needed a separate ‚Ä¶"
147,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,a year ago,Mediocre coffee and the service is really not so nice. We were asked 5 times in 10 mins if we wanted to order more. That‚Äôs a bit pushy.
148,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I ordered the London dish,which clearly says on the menu that it contains Eggs, bacon, toast, mushrooms, tomatoes etc.
But when my dish arrived, the eggs were burned heavily on the sides of the egg. ‚Ä¶"
149,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great staff and amazing hospitality, great food.  Second day in a row. There is even a breakfast burger on the menu! Definitely coming over here again when visiting Amsterdam next time."
150,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Good not great and service either.
151,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Although the place was with less than half of its capacity of clients, it took more than 30 min for my meal to arrive, a simple toast with scramble eggs and bacon on top. The food was under seasoning and cold-ish."
152,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,I ordered a mimosa and the breakfast club. The mimosa fell short. The sandwich bread was completely soggy. I would of said something but I didn't really feel like the server was friendly and just decided to eat what I could and leave.
153,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible service. We were there for 15min and NO ONE served us - and it felt we were being ignored as the waitress passed us a bunch of times and stopped at others' table just to ask if everything was ok (what means it was not busy at all). But at the end, we thank you because we crossed the street and found an amazing place."
154,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Ordered a nice toastie here yesterday however ended up returning the orange carrot and ginger juice that tasted very sharp and bitter with hard carrot pieces in it, I was told it was my problem, the old lady that runs the place reluctantly ‚Ä¶"
155,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"English ""London"" breakfast, i really like it here"
156,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, terrible service. On a very hot day sitting outside it took over 40 mins to get drinks even after asking twice. This meant we had nearly finished our food before getting a drink. Not ideal in 30 degree heat."
157,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Bad Service but good food
158,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"cosy restaurant with lots of choices for breakfast with good portions, the staff are welcoming and they have a good memory remembering their customers although we went there twice, the price range is ok.
I highly recommend it"
159,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Average food . Large portions .nothing amazing about the food but you won't be disappointed .  Ute neighborhood though it was on construction when we went so not the quietest breakfast . The staff are friendly and helpful
160,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,2 months ago,The food is very good!
161,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I can confirm the critics about the service.. My wife and I arrived and the service personal clearly noticed us, although we have not been welcomed or even greeted.. Then we sat there at least 20 minutes, while we could watch the waiters ‚Ä¶"
162,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Buttermilk pancakes are tasty and fluffy. Service is efficient
163,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,a year ago,Everyone who comes to Amsterdam have to visit this local for breakfast! The most delicious and tasty food in the whole City. Also for vegetarians üòâ
164,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been 3 times now, unfortunately the previous visit will probably be my last. Our food was forgotten about and had to ask the waitress to see what had happened to it. When it arrived, the quality was really poor and not worth the price at all. Shame as the first 2 visits where better"
165,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good food and coffee, love the full English, even though they're not proper sausages or bacon but that's hard to find in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
166,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The breakfast was fast and well prepared.
167,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,The pancakes were the worst i‚Äôve eaten since i came to the netherlands! I can‚Äôt say the staff isn‚Äôt friendly but they‚Äôre slow we waited for like 10 mins. or maybe more till they came to take our orders.
168,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very good place, tasty food and excellent coffee.
The service is quick and efficient, coming with a smile.
Expect to pay for the quality, but it‚Äôs worth it"
169,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I had spicy buffalo wings on a waffle. Cured my hangover.

The ‚Äúportion size to price‚Äù ratio was a bit off though."
170,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Waiting times are ridiculous. 30 min wait to order, then further 20 minutes for food. And then the food was no more than average. And then you‚Äôre hit with a big bill. Better options on the area."
171,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,a year ago,Good tasting food.
172,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good food - coffee could be bit better.
173,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was lovely and all day breakfast, how can you go wrong?

Service was lacking, it was meant to be table service and I think we were forgotten about also when I went to pay they had us on the wrong table."
174,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,Breakfast club. More like terrible service and food club. Not nice food. Waited an hour to be acknowledged by the staff. The food was cold and horrible. There was one nice man serving who was polite and endearing.
175,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The venue is cute and the girls do their best, that's about as nice as I can be. Food was very basic and underwhelming. Service was disorganised and slow, no sequence of service. Could be really good but they've got a long way to go."
176,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Been to this place twice and it has a great breakfast menu. Chicken and waffles, New York and English Breakfast. It‚Äôs simply delicious."
177,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty expensive for what you get, but the atmosphere is nice, and the food tastes good. There is basically always a wait to be seated, so get there early. And the staff are generally pretty nice."
178,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,9 months ago,The coffee that you give us was enough tasty thanks to welcome parisien üòç
179,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The atmosphere is ok, but the food isn't sophisticated neither well cooked -- didn't enjoy. Plus it was more expensive than much nicer places I have been to in Amsterdam."
180,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great pancakes, friendly staff."
181,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Always great food and good service! The pancakes with the honeycomb butter are amazing üëåüèºthey also have a nice variety of drinks and great food options for vegetarians
182,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good flavors profiles and taste really fresh, but the menu lacks more options and diversity. Stsff could also be less robotic and more heart-warming."
183,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Honestly thought the waitress was going to punch me in the face when we asked to split the bill. I prefer a slightly more relaxed environment when I go out for breakfast so won‚Äôt be returning.
184,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Horrible service, underwhelming food."
185,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was OK, service was OK. Good place if you wanna grab some late breakfast also they have vegan options"

187,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Whether you're out for an early breakfast or a late brunch, you can't go wrong with The Breakfast Club. Delicious dishes come in generous portions to fill any traveller's appetite before a busy day of sightseeing in Amsterdam."
188,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If I was stranded on an island and had to choose between a 'How to Build a Raft' book and their buttermilk pancakes with bananas, strawberries, blueberries and honey butter. ‚Ä¶"
189,The Breakfast Club, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very very good
190,The Breakfast Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"amazing food for breakfast, but the place is always a little bit in a rush and people/staff seemed in a hurry!"

204,The Breakfast Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The food and coffee was mediocre. They also refused to give us tap water which was ridiculous since we both ordered food and coffee. Too overrated.
205,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Checked-in on a beautiful sunny saturday afternoon. It was crowded, I understand but all I got was slow service, a dirty table, dry bread and overcooked eggs. But I probably will give it another chance üòä"

218,The Breakfast Club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent place, cute interior and good service but food was bland tasting and nothing special for the price."
219,The Breakfast Club, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Horrible service, it took them 15 min to serve 2 cappuccinos and 45 to serve the food... unbelievable !!! Never again until they hire more staff."
