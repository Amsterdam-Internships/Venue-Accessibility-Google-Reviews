8,Crea Café, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Local University of Amsterdam watering hole.  Ordered some pemgen (spicy meatballs) and a Serrano ham sandwich with two pints of Grolsch.  Food was good and so was beer.  They take Visa and MasterCard.  We've discovered not all places in Amsterdam do.  Cozy atmosphere with some couches and small pub style tables.
