0,Stach cafe, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"When I walked in I was greeted by a warm smile from the person serving me, who later told me their name was Leia. The service was fast and very friendly and the oat milk cappuccino was perfect!"
1,Stach cafe, 3 stars ,2 years ago,We stopped by here to have a breakfast. We ordered French menu and some croissants. Coffee was ok. Boiled egg menu was ok. Nothing special but compare to other breakfast places like staring at Jacob this place is very compact and so pricey! Would not recommend for a breakfast but ok to stop by for a coffee.
2,Stach cafe, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was ok but mostly due to waiting so long when already hungry.
We ordered coke and got some herbal rubbish which wasn't what we wanted.
A Dutch lady changed a note for smaller coins while we were here and the staff ‚Ä¶"
3,Stach cafe, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The best coffee in the city. Very popular snack corner. Two extremely inspiring Dutch ladies are taking care of the place on top level. Thanks so much
4,Stach cafe, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Organic but with a plastic straw LOL
as already mentioned here multiple time service is slow and not trained to cook or serve food. Random students making your burgers xD I won't be coming here again."
5,Stach cafe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little cozy cafe on the way to the Rijksmuseum.  Inside was clean, and the staff were very friendly.
We ordered 2 coffees, and the brew was tasteful. ‚Ä¶"

7,Stach cafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's a small coffee with amazing food and the loveliest girl serving.

8,Stach cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cheeseburgers here are excellent. Staff was very friendly and helpful, nice people. No beer or wine but interesting alternatives to the usual soft drinks. We'll definitely come back when we come here again."

10,Stach cafe, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"When we arrived, we were seated and were asked for our orders. We were waiting for the food when a plate was broken in the kitchen area. As well as this, the food was not served at the same time. However, the food was nice. I like the ‚Ä¶"
11,Stach cafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Definitely the best place to buy fresh bread in Amsterdam!

I also like their sandwiches and snacks! Plus, they offer samples of their cookies and pastries which is super cool! Staff is amazing!"
12,Stach cafe, 1 star ,4 years ago,I had a very bad experience. We didn't even get our food. We sat down with menus to order and were over looked for locals. I feel like tourists were not made to feel welcome here. When we finally ordered we sat for 30 minutes and no food ‚Ä¶
13,Stach cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Breakfast was excellent and offered egg and bacon aswell as pancakes and waffles. You will get your food quickly as well as good looking. They offer some drinks that i have atleast never seen an example would be curiousity cola. Not suited ‚Ä¶
