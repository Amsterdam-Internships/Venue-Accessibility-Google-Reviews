0,Café Scharrebier, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I had a really bad experience in this bar. The atmosphere was nice, but the owner was really rude to us, just because we were international students.  DO NOT GO In this bar if you're under 40 and not Dutch ."
1,Café Scharrebier, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very nice local bar. We were at the bar twice, the first night they served small cheese snacks. Lots of locals having a drink here - and there is nice choice of beer on tap."
2,Café Scharrebier, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Great for a few beers from draft. Typical local Amsterdam bar without any attempt to be pretentious.
3,Café Scharrebier, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The best place
4,Café Scharrebier, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A nice and cozy cafe. Good range of beers. Friendly staff.
5,Café Scharrebier, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Such a nice, cozy cafe, the word 'local' really springs to mind. The atmosphere is very relaxed. The woman who served us, I presume she's the owner, was very friendly and helpful. It's not a big place, it's just good."
6,Café Scharrebier, 1 star ,2 years ago,Rude service. Probably because we were not locals. The lady was insisting to keep the door right next to us open even if it was freezing cold outside. When we asked to close it she just ignored us and kept it open. She also got worried that we will leave without paying although we were standing in the queue waiting to pay..
7,Café Scharrebier, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Apple pie and beer, why not? Seems like the type of place frequented by the locals. Great place to just sit and have a couple beers. For Belgian Blonde fans that Brugse Zot, a couple of good lambics, and a Jopen IPA. Stay away from the Brand beers, they are not good."
8,Café Scharrebier, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"International neighbourhood cafe with wonderful staff and great terrace.A dozen or so different beers   on draft.Speciality : toasty with cheese and ... os se worst (raw beef,ox sausage )."
