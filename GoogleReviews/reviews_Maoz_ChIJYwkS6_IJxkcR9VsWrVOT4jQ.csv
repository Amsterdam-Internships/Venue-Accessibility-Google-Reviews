0,Maoz, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Nice falafel and concept where you fill in what you want. Chips are good too. Probably would say why would you charge for sauce I think that is a show stopper for some. Otherwise everything else is good. Fresh vegetables. I would recommend.
1,Maoz, 5 stars ,a month ago,Early nineties there was Falafel Dan which was my favourite because of the fresh lychee juice. Then there was Sonny's Falafel with tables outside across the street from Katsu but unfortunately he decided to wait out the pandemic with his …
2,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Hands down best falafel in town! super delicious salad bar,  and all VEGAN!"
3,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff is very friendly, and the falafel is really good. One of the best things about this place is that you can continue adding toppings while you eat as you deem necessary. Vegans do not have to miss out on fast food!"
4,Maoz, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Perfect falafels that are crunchy on the outside, soft and most importantly not dry on the inside. Freshly made, incredibly delicious, and unbelievably varied salads sauces and toppings. This is the best falafel in Amsterdam."
5,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I just love the concept of this place. Get a falafel and load it up with as many toppings as you can eat. This is a must when in Amsterdam for vegans and non-vegans alike. Lower-cost than most other places to eat and the quality is really good for what you're paying.
6,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is some of the best falafel I've ever had. And everything is 100% vegan! You can refill your pita as much as you want which makes it an all you can eat buffet for a reasonable price. The pickled eggplant is must!
7,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very clean and cozy. Have been here twice already and always leave stuffed, satisfied, and happy. Love that it’s an all you can eat salad bar. I probably go back and re-stuff my falafel 5-10 times during my meal. So so delicious and only 5.50 euros for a falafel with unlimited toppings."
8,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very tasty falafel! Option for wholemeal pita to make it more healthy. And unlimited toppings from the salad bar (or a decent size box if you ask for takeaway). Very good value for money (€5.50 for a proper meal). Service is also very welcoming and friendly.
9,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was the first falafel I ever tried, and some 20 years later it's still as good as I remember, if not better. The generous and indulgent range of toppings makes the price well worth it."
10,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I visited Maoz in order to relive my days in Berkeley when we had our own Maoz. This location was pretty quiet and just a block or so away from the market, so it was easy to stop in for lunch. I was impressed by the falafel- it was …"
11,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Mushroom shawarma portion has become too little. I've always tried to eat at Maoz in Amsterdam but my recent attempt has turned to negative experience by the minimum stock of the mushroom. When I finally got the chance, the mushroom that …"
12,Maoz, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The falafel is tasty as are the salads
But beware of the short gruff man behind the counter who watches if you spill anything and does a cleanup 3very 30 seconds practically...glaring all the while. …"
13,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Simply one of the best falafels out there. Love the fact that you can refill the salad and sauce. Makes every bite different and as good!
14,Maoz, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Really small portions.  Price is cheap, but the portions don’t really make sense to me.  3 falafels and all the salad you can cram into a small container."
15,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Incredible. Food was fantastic, service was brilliant. Can go up as many times as you want to the salad bar to keep topping up.  All for €6.  Very friendly staff"
16,Maoz, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very rude person behind the counter. Instead of asking us for the order, he was shouting at us and called us ""arrogant"" when we asked him to lower down his voice. We had already paid but seeing how rude the person behind the counter was, we …"
17,Maoz, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious and very filling!
The falafels are very meaty and full of flavour and the unlimited salad refills are great"
18,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I used to.go here when they had one in Soho in London. That one closed a few years ago. The food here was as good as I remember. Quieter than some of the other branches in Amsterdam, so you should get a seat here."
19,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Always happy with the food at Moaz, but I'm writing this review to compliment the extremely friendly staff who work in the De Pijp branch who are always so polite and helpful. Give them all payrises or at least a bonus! ;-)"
20,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great Falafel with a big choice of toppings with endless refill. Friendly staff and clean but small restaurant
