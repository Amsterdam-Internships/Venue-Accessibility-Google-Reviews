1,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"It's a nice place. In the winter, don't sit inside next to the door, cause ev was perfect but we freezed. I think it is IMPLICITLY necessary to keep customers warm in a place like this. To feel cozy. I didnt, at all. They didn't offer us ‚Ä¶"

3,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Oh dears... The poached eggs with bakon and the smoothies topped upnwith donuts were a delight. Make sure you haven't a lot of stomach space when you plan to get at the Corner Bakery though... You want to try everything üòÖü•∞. The manager ‚Ä¶

6,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Cute little caf√© with a good sense of aesthetic food presentation. Food was okay but not worth the price for us.
There are a lot of payment possibilities and ordering online via QR-Code works well."
7,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,Lovely place in De Pijp. Great food and service. That‚Äôs why it can be a bit tricky to get a table without reservation on busy times. I recommend to go online and book a table in advance. The BLT sandwich is very tasty and the American pancakes with fruits is delicious. Definitely will come back.
8,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good experience overall. Despite not having a reservation we were seated very quickly (2 people Sunday noon). Due to small space it can feel quite crammed and you‚Äôre sometimes touching elbows with the person at the next table. The food and ‚Ä¶

12,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service, laid back place, in a little side street if you want to get away from the city stress.

45,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice freak shakes in a cute little bakery. Missing a star as there seemed to be less options on the shake menu compared to what I'd seen online. Maybe there were specials we weren't told about?!

48,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,We were recommended by a friend but it definitely fell below expectations. The fruits were on the sour side and the pancakes are just not that great.
49,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"During the time in Amsterdam, me and my 8 friends had breakfast in this wonderful place, it's all really good and the staff are courteous. I will be back for sure on my next trip to Amsterdam  "
50,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Just correct. OK for the roll of pastrami...nevertheless the french toasts are too overloaded of cinamon powder, the capuccino is...a milk coffee. The pancakes are too thin, almost inexistants. Not worth coming back."

56,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 3 stars ,a year ago,Overrated to be honest. I didn't like the price for the value of product we got served. Stale donut and cookie on the freakshake. The red velvet cake was really dry and the cream cheese frosting was more butter then cream. Sorry to have to ‚Ä¶

64,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Disinterested service. After 20 minutes, we had to ask for a waiter to take our order, even though people who came in later were being served. When a part of the order came, it was placed on the table of the people sitting (way to close!) ‚Ä¶"
65,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious huge plate but I couldn't finish my pancakes. The unicorn chocolate was nice but we don't feel the chocolate enough for me. Otherwise is a little cozy place I liked it. That cute little name and the pink colour attracted me inside ‚Ä¶

Nice venue, cosy and always a good and friendly service."
78,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is nice, but the food was not more than mediocre. They don't pay attention on the details. To be honest, it doesn't even deserve the name ""bakery"" it doesn't have variety selection of fresh bread. Prices are far too high for what you get. Still it has potential, when it's not so crowded."
79,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Love the food menu but the coffee is hit or miss... depends on the day and employee. Sometimes decent, sometimes overbrewed/overheated. Dreamy hot chocolate and milkshake selections. Most of the staff is hilariously unfriendly, so -‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è for the slightly awkward atmosphere."
80,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Very crowded, over-rated, interior looked sweet and #girly though. The servers are weird and not very attentive. They have the not-giving-a-damn attitude which really contrasts with the location. Also the food didn't look incredible. They ‚Ä¶"

84,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 1 star ,3 years ago,My family and I actually liked this place as it is nearby and the food is usually good. However the service can be quite bad (you get your coffees only after you already finished your food etc) and it is also a very noisy place. Saying that ‚Ä¶

86,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Breakfast was perfect! The place is extremely instagrammable yet tiny, so remember to book your table online if you're more than 4. Also, no cash accepted."
87,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service is extremely bad. Even though there were several tables available we got pushed around for space. Staff clearly done with the day already one hour before the closing time. 15 min before closing they were cleaning the table while we were still eating. Super unprofessional.
Food was good tho."

90,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was really good but unfortunately the place was way too crowded and the tables were placed so tightly, that we couldn't sit comfortably. We got a table in the basement, which was quite cold and unfortunately a bit unwelcoming. I would not come back again!"
91,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My good golly! The freakshake is an undertaking to construct and to devour though if you have a sweet tooth I would say dive in!

93,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It exceeded Rhonda's expectations--very hard to do.  Wonderful coffee, oatmeal, gluten free pancakes.interesting menu.  We all had two coffees.  Beautiful people eat here, but casual."
94,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Ordered two freakshakes, waited ages for our order and the waitress gave someone else our order, they even took snaps with my freakshake before realising their mistake.... plus, there was wasps flying inside and outside the shop. Most of the pics you see on insta didn't look at all insta worthy... so be prepared to be disappointed."
95,Corner Bakery Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Staff could be a bit more attentive to the mess on the tables/floor. Red velvet pancakes wasn‚Äôt anything amazing but the american pancakes were nice. Basic coffee
