13,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Super nice barmen and personnel. The cocktails are served in great vintage glasses.  The menu is written so nice and attractive. It is a seated bar so you might need to wait outside.
14,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing service along with amazing cocktails.  The presentation of the drinks is quirky and the flavours are balanced and interesting. It is a little bit pricey but worth it. My only complaint is the menu is difficult to read because the pages are thick cardboard.
15,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this place! We found it randomly walking around the city and stopped in for drinks. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. They give you a bottle of water with each drink you order, which I think is amazing. They will make you a …"

19,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This spot is fantastic. The cocktails are inventive and delicious. Inside of the bar is a tight fit for big groups but they handle it well by making sure they seat folks. They are particular about seating with coats off due to space which isn't a big deal as you can see where your coat wanders off to. Enjoy this place immensely!
20,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Amazing interior and even better personnel. We found it by accident and were planning to stay for a drink, and yet we stayed til closing. If you have a chance sit inside and enjoy the music, the atmosphere, and definitely talk to the employees!!"
21,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 2 stars ,6 months ago,Atmosphere is good. Nice music. Service was not to good. My expectation is that a person sitting at the bar with an empty glas should get asked for another drink. It took a while to get the attention of the mixologist. The cocktails are …

26,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The place is really nice. You can find perfect cocktail for your taste. Always crowded. Hard to find a space to sit. So try to go early. Every week they have different types of cocktails. So don't miss the change when you arrive there. …

136,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Super fun coctail bar!!! You got a story behind every single drink on the menu. If you just want a drink easy and fast this is not a good place, it takes too long to read the whole menu. Super fun  though. You should take your time and enjoy this fun experience and the coctail are great."

145,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I like this place - they're always ready to listen to your cravings and come up with something unusual and fascinating. There's a large cocktail cart to pick from, too. The place if fairly tiny and fitting in a large group is not an option, but there's usually a place for up to 4 person group."
146,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"By far our favorite bar ever, the staff specifically Roberto is amazing.

156,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Lots of good cocktails, which are renewed often so you wont really have enough time to try them all. Its relatively accessible price wise. You cant always have a table in busy nights so if you are with a group better book in advance."
157,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Unique place with amazing cocktails. They are expensive but worth it. Be aware that there is a dress code: you at your best. They dont expect a 3 piece suit but I would not were ripped jeans.
158,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Expensive, but the drinks, food, service was amazing.  Our waiter didn't really want to talk about drinks (which I get) but he completely opened up about Amsterdam.  He even called a local restaurant to see if they had room for us.  He then …"

161,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely enjoyed my time here. But probably for the wrong reasons. There can be cue outside depending on the time that you go. Saw a would-be couple fight about waiting in line while their 3rd wheel valiantly tried to save the evening. …
162,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Nice people. Good place. Excellent cocktails
163,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food and original cocktails. Good ambience. The risotto was awesome, jalapeno poppers were good too. The cheese plate was disappointing - very small, including 5 french cheeses which were all soft, and 2 of them were extremely...pungent."
164,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Staff fantastic! Food creative and wonderful! Cocktails.....when you're picky like me you can tell them your likes and dislikes and they will woop you up a customized cocktail for you. My 2nd time here and not my last for sure!!!! Love, love, love this place. Thanks T&S ❤️"
165,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Two cocktails were enough to induce tipsiness despite not tasting alcohol, which is an art in itself. Cocktails comes with a story as suspected. A small bottle of water is also included with every drink. A sweet little booklet menu with …"

169,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A MUST STOP IN AMSTERDAM! Tales and Spirits has fantastic service and delightfully themed cocktails that actually taste as great as they are fun.  If you are there with a friend I recommend a Splish Splash (fun 2 person drink).  Enjoy!
170,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Long wait but worth it. We were seated at the bar where we could see the barmaid operating her talent, she was kind and of very good advice. Still, not as good as Door 74 to us !"

175,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Staff is nice, great cocktails of course and it’s super, super cosy place. Often packed so try to head over early. Watch for the cool secret stash books they hand you with the bill, cool but it’ll get expensive if you had a dozen cocktails ;)"
176,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Tales & Spirits will definitely leave you with an outstanding experience, which mostly comes down to the passionate staff.

181,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"wow wow wow. They grab your coat when you get in, and free water. 15€ + - per drink. Fair price for such great drinks.

191,‚ÄãTales & Spirits, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I can’t recommend this place enough! The drinks are a thing of art.
