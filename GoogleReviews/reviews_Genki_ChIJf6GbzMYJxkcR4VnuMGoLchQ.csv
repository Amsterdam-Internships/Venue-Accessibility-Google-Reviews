0,Genki, 5 stars ,a month ago,Great service and they have a lot of special rolls which you don’t have at other places. Service is quick and friendly. It is a bit dark inside the restaurant but creates a good atmosphere.
1,Genki, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,A good sushi restaurant in the centre of Amsterdam. The upstairs was lovely and we really enjoyed all the food! Some nice cocktails too.
2,Genki, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Very nice garden sushi place! Fresh sushi with a lot of choices. Very nice to sit in the garden, but they also have a terrace.
They could have more toilets. 1 per gender is a bit of a stretch. Right now, may …"
3,Genki, 1 star ,4 months ago,"We ordered via uber eat a 40 euro meal made of 4 things. We received only 3 of them, the most expensive was missing. When I called the restaurant I've been told that they were not responsible if the uber driver stole the meal and that I …"
4,Genki, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Crazy good service, best value for money and one of the most beautiful terraces i ve ever been in Amsterdam.
Totally worth it and I am not even a sushi fun.
Also amazing fish aquarium 🤣"
5,Genki, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"20e for all you can eat sushi.
Price is really cheap and the food come fast (too fast) but it is because all the food is already prepared in advance. Probably they must have only 1 or 2 staff …"
6,Genki, 1 star ,4 months ago,Be careful if you’re a tourist visiting Amsterdam and trying to get some sushi. The all you can eat prices are hidden and are only disclosed when you have to pay. They are very cold if you try and ask for the price in advance and they only take cash… seems like a tourist trap to me.
7,Genki, 5 stars ,9 months ago,First time I have visited this restaurant and I will definitely come back more often. It’s a typical Japanese all-you-can-eat sushi & grill restaurant (with a la carte too). Not the best but above average. I loved the vibes on their …
8,Genki, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Unfriendly staff, they limited our menu to a couple of available dishes with the excuse that the kitchen was no longer working (it was around 8 in the evening), although the guests next to us chose dinner from the regular menu.  The dish …"
9,Genki, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food and atmosphere was nice, but just a typical all you can eat sushi experience. Two big downside compared to other similar restaurants is that the sushi selections only come with one per order (it’s usually 2) and dessert isn’t apart …"
10,Genki, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Good food with good price 😋.. sorry food it's very good so no photo attached
11,Genki, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasty food that is detracted from by average service and overpriced drinks.

Wait staff refused us tap water and charged 6€ for bottled, which was pricey …"
12,Genki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The garden is incredible for sunny days, really uncommon in the heart of Amsterdam. Also the sushi is melt in mouth fantastic. The aquarium is also well maintained and has some really beautiful fish!"
13,Genki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We really enjoyed the all you can eat dinner! Everything tasted fresh and yummy. My only suggestion to them would be to add more Maki roll options to the menu. The service was very friendly by all employees and fairly quick also.
14,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"All you can eat worth it 100%.
The guy who served us was extremely kind.
Pay attention to the water glass bottle, they didn't tell us that the price of …"
15,Genki, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good sushi and other Japanse dishes for an average all you can eat price. Really good location and good service.
16,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice restaurant. If you are allergic to cats I would not go and if you don’t like cats running around in a restaurant I would not suggest it either.  Otherwise it’s really really good!!
17,Genki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This was awesome! Had a all you can eat lunch at Genki and it was amazing. All the dishes were delicious and food decently quick to arrive. We only managed to get to round 4!
18,Genki, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Just had a delish family dinner at Genki! Sat in a table in the garden, so beautiful and surrounded by hydrangeas. Lovely food presentation, delicious taste, friendly service, and a huge variety on the menu. Fantastic way to finish our visit in Amsterdam!"
19,Genki, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The food is great. Price is reasonable. You do need to pay cash. No cards. Service is OK. When it's busy they do time you as it's a 2 hour all-you-can-eat.
20,Genki, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Good all-you-can-eat restaurant with a fair price. Unfortunately some of the items were not available when I visited but their food taste good. The location is great and the staff is friendly.
21,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Sushi. If you love sushi, you have to go to Genki. Unlike a lot of other places, there is a lot of good, fresh fish in the sushi, and not a lot of rice. You can sit inside or outside in the Genki Garden. The staff is friendly, fast and helpful."
22,Genki, 1 star ,a month ago,Terrible food. The management just says serving you expired sashimi is their speciality. What a joke
23,Genki, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The place has a nice garden setting, very cosy especially when the weather is beautiful. Other than that, there is not much to be told. …"
24,Genki, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A good restaurant that offers the possibility of sitting outside on the terrace. Good. Good food with creative options such as meat with fruit. Of course, the Japanese food classic was fantastic."
25,Genki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good food. For an ""all you can eat"" the price was generous. The logistics is weird though, you can have 5 rounds of 5 options each, total of 25 options (so it's not ""all you can eat"" actually) but still it was enough for me."
26,Genki, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Super fun dining experience with the essentially unlimited options, but not the place for super high quality sushi. Very fun though!"
27,Genki, 2 stars ,4 months ago,bad smell inside and very mediocre sushi. rice was hard and fish not fresh. had better sushi!
28,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,you can eat in the garden when the weather is nice. Good sushi fresh. One of my favourite restaurants in Amsterdam
29,Genki, 1 star ,a year ago,Average spot. Would not recommend. There are better all you can eat sushi restaurants with better service. The guys and girl behind the counter were not paying a lot of attention to the customers. Furthermore I would expect in an all you …
30,Genki, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Yummy food, good vibes and friendly staff.
I recommend the all you can eat menu as a lunch."
31,Genki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"At the end, for €28,75 a person we had some drinks all we could eat and ice cream desert: an awsome lunch. Relaxed table service, good food."
32,Genki, 1 star ,a year ago,Old sushi.. old system with a map and pen and NO ICECREAM included for 33 euro per person...? Worst experience ever...
33,Genki, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great food and very cozy garden area. Definitely recommend. They're pretty good catering for people with a gluten free diet. Better than most other sushi restaurants I've seen so far.
34,Genki, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This place is amazing! I came with my friend for quick bite and we ended up staying there for literal hours. The food is superb and service just as good; all smiles, great humour and super helpful even during rush hour. Also, you should really try their sake mojito, it's brilliant."
35,Genki, 2 stars ,a year ago,"NOT ""All you can eat"". I do not understand how this place and others can legally say all you can eat, when you're limited to just 25 items per person. It's essentially just prepaid a la carte where you must pay extra for items such as …"
36,Genki, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"As a local and sushi fan, I come here often and tend to bring in different groups of friends and tourists with me also. What I can do without, is some of the rude attitude that I got from the guy who works here. The ladies are all very …"
37,Genki, 5 stars ,a year ago,The best sushi/grill in Amsterdam!
38,Genki, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"you had to wait long, they can forget about your order. also they are not providing tap water (which they have to by law). sushi was ok."
39,Genki, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Genki at Reguliersdwarstraat is a picturesque place and the service is nice. The all you can eat menu does not include desserts, such as ice, which Miu Miu does offer. However, that does not detract from the overall experience."
40,Genki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We booked a table for 4pm to beat the dinner rush and got served so quickly. You can order 5 dishes 5 times per person, and trust me, it is more than enough. We got to 20 dishes each and could not go on! They offered gluten free soy sauce …"
41,Genki, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The staff and the service is amazing , the food is perfect and fast serving, sushi is no one but the mix rice and the checken/ beef is a very heavy oily cooked but still good."
42,Genki, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice environment,good service, tasty food not so big variety,prices OK"
43,Genki, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The overall experience is usually very positive - nice quality of sushi and other meals. Between 1 and 4 p.m. there is no way for someone to finish the food without being completely full, all for only 20€! (it is basically unlimited food …"
44,Genki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best sushi I've ever eaten. Very good quality and wide range of choice. The restaurant is clean and the staff helpful. Good value for money if we consider that Amsterdam is expensive.
45,Genki, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Small menu and the price went up to 34 euro.
Quality of the sushi rolls is very average."
46,Genki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I came here for my birthday. The sushi was really good & there is LOADS of items to choose from. There’s 5 rounds that you can receive, but I only managed to finish the 3rd round because it was so much food. If you don’t finish your food …"
47,Genki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,All you can eat sushi! Cant go wrong there... actually it isnt really all you can eat technically as you are given 5 order rounds and each order round you can pick 5 items from the menu... so in total you get to pick 25 which is quite a lot …
48,Genki, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Portions are small. When it comes to fried rice, the price is cheap, but you can get 3 or 4 times as much at any other Asian restaurant for 1 or 2 more euros. Taste is good though"
49,Genki, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The dinning area is surrounded by nature which is amazing with cool vibes and very friendly staff. The sushi taste was below average yet the food portion is big and it's not pricy at all.
50,Genki, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"It used to be pricey (35euros for all you can eat sushi) but they have lowered the price to 23,95euros and sashimi is also included but you can only order 5 items per round in a total of 5 rounds. …"
51,Genki, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I liked the place, view outside was very nice. Service was also pretty good, I didn't have to wait for 30 minutes before my food arrived. The tables outside were a bit too high for my taste, and also a bit too small. …"
52,Genki, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Used to be my favorite all-you-can-eat sushi place 1-2 year ago, but they changed a lot. you have to pay for sashimi now and the sushi is not that good anymore. Fried/baked stuff is good but it's not what you are looking for in a sushi place."
53,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place for good sushi. The gyoza dumplings were super delicious.

They have a 5 items per 5 rounds system which can be a pretty substantial meal with a lot of variety."
54,Genki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great quality sushi and lovely other dishes available as well.
55,Genki, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Went there with my kids, as we did reservation and confirmed with the guy staff In front, I followed him for get a table.. he took baby chair and start to snapped because I was next to him and yelling said ‘can you just wait over there, I’m …"
56,Genki, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Be careful with the water they have on each table. In the end you will see it in your bill for the price 6,5 EUR :) overall nice, but there are much better places for all you can it Japanese food, with more options to choose from"
57,Genki, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Genki Lunch is always worth it. Great prices for a really decent Sushi. I had so much worse. Cute kittens in the restaurant, I just like it. Maybe my favorite Sushi place in Europe."
58,Genki, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The food was not fresh (my girlfriend and I felt really sick at night..) and the waiter was really not friendly at all. He seemed annoyed about our asks. If you want to eat good Japanese food, it's clearly not the good place to go. Furthermore, it was quite expansive. Don't go there."
59,Genki, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"if quantity is important - this is your place!  All you can eat.   It goes without saying that there are many other places where you can have great sushi, if that's what your going for, you might look a little further.  Kind staf, very nice …"
60,Genki, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Asian food in the heart of the city center.
Offers a all you can eat deal. Although the kitchen staff clearly has no idea what Japanese food is, its nowhere close. …"
61,Genki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I only went because I found and all you can eat deal on Social Deal. Note that all you can eat is only 6 rounds I believe. However, during each round you can order 5 items (30 items total). I was unbelievably stuffed after the third round! …"
62,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A must eat when visiting Amsterdam and you share. A passion for Asian food. Good music and very kind and customer focused staff. The manager is a very friendly host who's running the place like a boss ...You'll always have a good time at Genki.
63,Genki, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I am a frequent customer and I must say that the treatment received is not polite anymore. We got a table number, when we went to pay (after waived to the waiter many times) we said the number of the table and we got anothers table receipt, …"
64,Genki, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Not the best experience. Price was similar as compared to other all you can eat sushi places but the sushi was not up to the mark. Also the ebi tempura and ebi sushi were served cold. I would opt for another sushi restaurant next time.
65,Genki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A very chill place, and my favorite sushi place in the summer time because of their pretty garden.
Food is good and price is reasonable for all you can eat."
66,Genki, 1 star ,2 years ago,Great place to go if you want to lose some weight cause the next few days you won't be able to keep any food in your stomach! If you aren't interested in getting foodpoisoned it's a less optimal spot. No refunds!
67,Genki, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Three stars for this restaurant because it's ok, but all's said with that. Why not more stars? Below you can find a few reasons why:
1. Not a great number of dishes on the menu. For example Sumo has more options. …"
68,Genki, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice restaurant, very friendly and helpful staff, that also gives good advice. Also a very good location, on a pretty side street, so you can enjoy the beauty of Amsterdam while you eat. …"
69,Genki, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Update on my visit from today;
I have personally come to the conclusion that these AYCE stores are low in qualit in order to compensate for the number of orders you can make. When I eat …"
70,Genki, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Good sushi and quite cheap prices
71,Genki, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Wonderful Sushi.. Really like the taste of it and the service was super good.
72,Genki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,In the centre of Amsterdam in this street you will find many bars and restaurants. Genki is an all you can eat sushi with cold and warm dishes. Food is good al though the place can get noisy. Realy recommend this when you hungry its realy all you can eat.
73,Genki, 1 star ,2 years ago,All you can eat menu is lumitwd. All the good stuff are extra. Tap water is extra. Staff is not polite. Well it might be in Canada I used to politeness as standard. Stay away from this place.
74,Genki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The garden is worth seeing without eating but the all you can eat just means you stay for longer ..... not the best sushi I’ve ever eaten but then I paid a lot more for that. Good price, great location .... you’ll be fine"
75,Genki, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food BUT : they tricked us to make us pay a 6e bottle of water (in France water is free, not here apparently), the menu is EXTREMELY expensive (we paid 64e for 2 persons !!! in France for the same all you can eat buffet we usually pay …"
76,Genki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favourite sushi spots in Amsterdam. During summer time you can sit in the garden, which is lovely, service is usually good, the atmosphere is very relaxed"
77,Genki, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Pretty good sushi. Kind of dark and dingy place. Felt expensive. ""All you can eat"" really means up to five rounds of 5 pieces. You pay extra for what you don't finish."
78,Genki, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent Japanese dish restaurant. Each person gets to choose 5 dishes, and there are 5 rounds. That's enough to eat to your hearts content!"
79,Genki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great taste, great food. The food in the menu looks small but their portions are quite big. Everything we ordered so far taste good. I advise."
80,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice music and great quality food. Also, nice aquarium."
81,Genki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is amazing. Spent a lot of time and ate way too much sushi and edamame. Must visit. They have a lovely garden as well with lots of hydrangeas. The guy who owns the place is a true rockstar
82,Genki, 3 stars ,8 years ago,Not a bad visit but I would not call it perfect sushi. It is not always prepared fresh for order. Rice and tempura are sometimes cold. Maybe it depends on a day or time of visit. …
83,Genki, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great sushi deals; good price and really tasty. Nice indoor garden area
84,Genki, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice restaurant, great garden, friendly staff, food is nice, price is ok. 3 stars: worth giving a check if you feel for sushi in the centre of Amsterdam."
85,Genki, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Ok sushi for reasonable price. Great garden with tables for eating.

Max 5 items per round and max 5 rounds. I never make it past round 4 so easily 'All i can eat'"
86,Genki, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Lovely backgarden, sushi is okay, amazing atmosphere"
87,Genki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Everything was amazing in this sushi place except for the fact that initially there was a bottle of water on the table that we sat. I felt it not fair something to be paid and not ordered by us to be on the table.
88,Genki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Ok the food is very good service great we went on all you can eat for 19.50€ each drinks on top but the you can order 5 dishes each and 5 times but beware if you don't eat a dish they charge you2€ each one you don't finish other than that great atsmosphere too
89,Genki, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Dont understand the hype about this place.  Fish tastes defrosted and watery. Most stuff has no flavour at all... Apparently most people that review here dont know real sushi and the taste of fresh fish...
90,Genki, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Overpriced and mediocre sushi, our udon arrived with a piece of dirt floating in it, and they refuse to serve tap water. Our table was situated next to a dustbin."
91,Genki, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Both fish and rice had no taste. Other dishes are better, but nothing special. Fast service though."
92,Genki, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty good quality sushi. However, the price for both food and drinks is quite high and dessert isn't included in the price"
93,Genki, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place, good sushi a bit smaller than expected but nice atmosphere."
94,Genki, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great sushi for the ""All you can eat"" menu. No desert options though, which I've seen at other restaurants with this option."
95,Genki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great & delicious food, great service, had a great table upstairs nice and cosy with a view and nice heater close by. They will definitely see me back."
96,Genki, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Tasty sushi.No big surprises, you get what you pay for.We will come back foe sure.Thank you"
97,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice staff and food was delicious. I think this restaurant is better than the other all you can eat sushi restaurants in Amsterdam.
98,Genki, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Cosy restaurant with great prices and good quality food. It's easy to reach and a real gem! The only thing is, sometimes the staff can be really stuborn and not wanting to help you with your order."
99,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best sushi i have ever tried in Europe, staff is very friendly and helpful. If you looking for sushi this place you must visit. :)"
100,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Omg. This is amazing. 28 euro per person but you can order up to 20 portions each. Alot of food and great fun
101,Genki, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food..but cheap mentality..they limit the amount of food you can eat..”all you can eat” , but 5 dishes per round, 5 rounds max..
Like the rest of the dutch, they are cheap.
Which is a shame cause the food was good."
102,Genki, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice, well-priced sushi with a lot of choice. The outside tables look very nice, but on understaffed periods it's not available"
103,Genki, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious food well worth the price. You wont leave this place hungry! Highly recommend and a bargain during lunch hours.
104,Genki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice sushi and awkward style of all you can eat.. I understood it eventually and really enjoyed it. Loved the sushi with the banana!
105,Genki, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good variety. But the all you can eat menu was a little expensive compared to other restaurants in town.
106,Genki, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food was ok but worth it if you are big eater. You get a 5-round with 5-dish each round. We ended up with the 3rd round
107,Genki, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The ambience of the place is great. Can go there with a date and food is also above average. Not all seating is comfortable though and the place can feel crowded sometimes.
108,Genki, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best sushi places in Amsterdam. Go during lunch for the same all you can eat menu for much less.
109,Genki, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Good sushi that tastes really fresh, fast service, good variety, good price for the lunch all you can eat (unlike other all you can eat sushi restaurants in Amsterdam they don't have differing menus for lunch and dinner but the price is …"
110,Genki, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great fresh sushi for a very fair price. Probably amazing in the summer because of the outside seating area in the garden.
111,Genki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is absolutely amazing. Honestly the best sushi place ive been to before.
112,Genki, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good place with great sushi! Normally they accept only cash but last time they allowed us to pay with our credit cards.

114,Genki, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Price is extremely high with no actual reason , all fish in not fresh. Some of them taste like the fridge . Don’t go there !!!!!!!!!!!!"
115,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best sushi restaurants in town! With a lovely garden, friendly staff and fast service"
116,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love the all you can eat sushi here. Staff is also nice, smiling."
117,Genki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice food and the all you can eat is definitely worth the money although it's quite a challenge to get to round 5!

127,Genki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Book it... Book it book it.... food is mint.. location is cool.. value for money is unreal. Would go back just for this place. Don't mind the cat he works there...
128,Genki, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty limited choice of dishes. Food is ok, for the price that you pay it is even good!"
