76,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great service and fantastic, authentic Chinese food. I really appreciated the waitress telling us we ordered too much food for just two people so we skipped one dish. The portions are quite large and price/quality is good. Just the drinks are on the expensive side."
77,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I've been living in China for about 3 years and while some of the dishes didn't taste exactly the same as what I usually get in China, it was really tasty and in my opinion some of the most authentic Chinese food I have eaten in Europe. ‚Ä¶"

278,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is really tasty and the portions are large. It happened that they forgot to prepare the appetisers for us, and they were so apologetic that they treated us with free drinks (approx 40 euros). Needless to say they left a great impression. Again I should emphasise that the food is really really good!"
279,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"What an unbelievable dining experience! Seriously, this was the best Chinese food I've had outside of China proper! The Si Chuan food was spicy and flavorful but not too oily. The food was amazing, especially the Kung Pao Chicken and the ‚Ä¶"

296,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This is one of the best Chinese dishes I've had, besides actually in China of course. There is a myth that they have a special menu for native Chinese people... it just might be true."

305,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,a year ago,Authentic Szechuan kitchen with nice spicy dishes. Recommended are the salty grilled lamb chops and the egg plant in red sauce (not spicy).

307,FuLu Mandarijn, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Although the food is good and some of the dishes stand out with great flavor, they have raised the prices to ridiculous amounts. If you have a club card (yes, they have their own now) then you get better pricing for some things."
308,FuLu Mandarijn, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Dissapointing. Reviews are good but is not the reality. Expensive. Noisy. It is 3 floors, more than a restaurant is a fabric. 29,90‚Ç¨ Pancake with some pieces of duck (nothing to do with the picture), 17,90 ‚Ç¨ for a side dish with only Pak Choi. Too expensive."

310,FuLu Mandarijn, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great Chinese food with a better setting. The place is always full, so better make a reservation. Not a relaxing but quite noisy and crowded as there are many group tables but this is quite normal that you expect from the most Chinese restaurants"
311,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Fu Lu Mandarijn Amsterdam is the best Chinese restaurant I ever visited in Europe. Their authentic Sichuan Chinese style spicy food are really delicious. Location is so easy to find. It is in the Center of the city very near to Dam square and center station. Highly recommended for Chinese food lover.
312,FuLu Mandarijn, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The price quality ratio is not so good, plus the waiting time (for getting a table & for getting your first dish) is wayyy too long. Food is ok but not worth the price. ‚Ä¶"
313,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Their service is pretty good, and the dishes are delicious. The taste is almost the same as what you can have in the great China area. Recommend!"
314,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Even tho it‚Äôs pricey I will come back again and again! There are some authentic Chinese dishes like the twice cooked pork and beans. Don‚Äôt try the pork rib soup - it‚Äôs nothing like the real deal.
315,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best restaurants I've ever visited in my life! The waitress had really good recommendations - the food was awesome in taste and presentation.

319,FuLu Mandarijn, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Mega overpriced. From the prices of the dishes I expected something special and it was just like any regular Chinese restaurant. The place is very crammed and loud which made us want to leave straight away. Staff is very friendly.

We are happy with their committed services too."

The lichee mock-tail is refreshing."
365,FuLu Mandarijn, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Mediocre food at luxury prices.
Rice plate not recommended. Prawns and beef were okish, sauces had way too much fat. Vegetables non-existent.
Service terribly slow, yet friendly."
366,FuLu Mandarijn, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Mainly for tourists. Staff doesn't speak Dutch. If this is the best Szechuan food in Amsterdam then that says more about the paucity of Chinese restaurants than the quality of this one, which I think is mediocre."

381,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nothing to complain about the food. Though It is getting more expensive than it used to be. Considering it is the only restaurant that serves real Chinese food, the price kinda pays off."
382,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Actually worth the money.  Most authentic takeaway we‚Äôve had in the Netherlands.
383,FuLu Mandarijn, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Big portions are definitely worth it for 2+ people. Quick and good service for fair prices. Going back soon for sure.
