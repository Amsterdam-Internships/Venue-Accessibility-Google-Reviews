0,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,a month ago,"One of my sweetest memories in Amsterdam. As good to get a beer by the canal, in the sun by the street or even inside in gorgeous pub style. With locals and lovely staff. Delicious local beers and good food too!"
1,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"We were here only to have a drink. The waiter was really friendly. He suggested that we should try the blonde beer and my husband said it was really good. While I had only ginger tea, but it‚Äôs real ginger not some ginger on a tea bag. The ‚Ä¶"
2,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Great little pub.. The two ladies working there (owners? ) super fun and really make you feel at home
3,'t Smalle, 1 star ,5 months ago,"We have been there, waited for 20 minutes. The table has not been cleaned, we have not been addressed what we want and of course other tables have been served around. Never again."
4,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,4 months ago,One of the best bars in the area. Friendly staff and nice seats on the canal
5,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"‚Äòt Smalle might be one of the greatest Amsterdam bar i‚Äôve been to! First, they don‚Äôt play music, which might discourage some people from coming but it‚Äôs actually much better this way. Listening to the white noise and people chatting offers ‚Ä¶"
6,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Lovely staff, wonderful atmosphere and a great location. Just went in for drinks but had a very lovely evening."
7,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Even without the amazing canal-side patio (which you should definitely sit at) this is an amazing bar. Great food, great drink selection; (try the Jenever, we loved it!) sitting by the canal sipping a beer at Cafe 't Smalle is just about the best way you can spend an afternoon in Amsterdam. We loved it here."
8,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great tiny outdoor seating on the canal. Don't fall into the water. Perfect place for a beer after walking by the canals enjoying the lovely city. We all need to stay hydrated. Be prepared to share a table because there are not that many places. But that is just great because then you might meet new interesting people.

14,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Small and cosy cafe next to the canals in the heart of the Jordaan. This cafe is authentic and it's a good place to meet with people for a conversation. The staff is very nice. In summer you can sit in from of the door outside next to the canals. There is a good selection of beers and wine.
15,'t Smalle, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing location, outdoor seating is basically in the canal. It was phenomenal on a nice sunny morning. Coffee was great, but the food was just okay. A little overpriced for breakfast which was mostly just breads. I would recommend for a coffee or drink pit stop in the sun. üåû"
16,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Dove in here late one evening, during a windy storm & couldn't have been more delighted. Lovely cosy bar with really friendly staff and a great range of drinks."

18,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really great little bar. Great booze and nice snacks as well. The main party of the bar is quite small, however there is also a small upstairs around the back.

21,'t Smalle, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great location. Service is a bit disorganized and the tables a bit unsteady but the location makes it well worth the stop for a coffee or a beer.

41,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Drinks are good and service has been great!! Will definitely come back!
42,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect place to sit next to a water. Dont expect the third wave coffee, but the ""traditional one"". Croissants are amazing and the small breakfast for under 9e in Amsterdam is quite a good deal (with coffee, orange juice, egg, croissant and butter and jam). All in all very comfortable and nice."
43,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a very cute little bar on the water. I highly recommend!
44,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place to unbrace yourself by having a glass of beer.  It has a nice view of canal.

46,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly service but not intrusive. Fantastic quality beers poured perfectly. Great snacks perfectly matching with glass of Dutch brews. Authentic atmosphere feel and great location. Will come back.
47,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Officially on my list of favourite cafes / pubs / bars on Earth. While I was there the power was of for some reason in that district of Amsterdam and the entire bar was candlelit - which was perfect. ‚Ä¶
48,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,a year ago,This place is like a museum! Probably my first stop when I get off the plane and penetrate the Jordaan neighborhood!! Outstanding beer selection and a highly recommended pea soup!!!
49,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent little bar. Really friendly staff and a nice place to relax and enjoy a beer away from the hustle and bustle. It is small inside but when I went it didn't feel too cramped. They have pint glasses here. Prices are cheapish. Really nice decor.
50,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good service with nice personal staff and the building itself is a fine example of the famous brown caf√©s in Amsterdam. Good beer on draft and a good bottled selection with wine also on offer. It faces directly onto the canal and is easy to ‚Ä¶
51,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very characteristic dutch pub from another time.  Small, with a few levels, often hard to find a place.   Some mix of locals and tourists. Full bar, pub grub, good atmosphere.  No loud music.  Just sit and chat and drink, maybe Munch on something"
52,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best outside sitting areas in the city! Just around the corner from the Anne Frank Museum it is a perfect place to sit and enjoy the city. Right on a canal you can enjoy the boats go by and watch the bikes cycle past. The service ‚Ä¶

55,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Very nice place, interesting interior. In good weather offers very nice small terrace next to the canal, but difficult to find a spot on a busy sunny day. Service and menu are of average standards of Amsterdam. It worths visiting for the cozy atmosphere."
56,'t Smalle, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fabulous location, slightly grumpy service but all good. It is, as one would expect, a big tourist trap, like most of the centre of Amsterdam, but if one visits early-ish, it'll be fine. Lovely views over the canals, centrally located and definitely worth a visit."
57,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cute quiet little place with a good drink selection. Beer, wine, and liquors. We did not get a chance to taste the food but it looked really yummy"
58,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great little bar. When you enter it's as if you've stepped back in time: wood panelled walls and stain-glass windows. A friend who lives in Amsterdam took us here on our first visit a couple of years ago and it made such an impression we came back.
59,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good Americano, Terrace is extremely beautiful to sit on - directly at the canal"
60,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Small, idyllic. Good place to start, stop or end a Trip to Jordan."

62,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,5 years ago,One of my favorite brown bars in Amsterdam. A very hobbit feeling inside with a mix of locals and tourists. Small but nice outdoor seating. La Chouffe on tap!

66,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Fabulous cafe bar to sit by the canal on a sunny day but even better is to squash inside with the locals and tourists on a wet winters evening and enjoy the candle lit tables and great beer selection. Recommended.

72,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A cosy brown caf√© right in the Jordaan. Don't overlook it, it doesn't have a lot of direct sunlight seeping in but it makes it up with the mood and with the tasty dishes. ‚Ä¶"
73,'t Smalle, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A lovely small bar we found whilst wandering around. Good beer and food available. Outside seating available.

75,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want to feel like a local and if you want a real and true Amsterdam experience, go to Cafe t'Smalle. My favourite cafe / brown bar in all of Amsterdam and one of my favourite places in the world."
76,'t Smalle, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"PERFECT Amsterdam classic brown cafe. Sit upstairs if you can and gaze at the atmospheric barrels and be grateful for the super friendly waitress. Olives are the typical Amsterdam type (read: not great), but the oude kaas hit the spot with ‚Ä¶"

97,'t Smalle, 5 stars ,a month ago,Top top !
98,'t Smalle, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Wait staff is pants-on-fire bad.  Once we ordered drinks, they never came back -- to take orders or bring us the bill.  So we left.  Free drinks, I suppose."
99,'t Smalle, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"It's a tourist place by the canal so you'll have to be lucky to get a seat. If you do, you'll have access to OK food and OK drinks at OK prices (for Amsterdam's Jordaan district)."
