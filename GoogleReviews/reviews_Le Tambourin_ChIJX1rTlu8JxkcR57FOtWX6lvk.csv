0,Le Tambourin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Not your typical museum fare! Great food and wonderful atmosphere. Chef is personable and friendly; great service. After reluctantly heading over to the café for lunch, our group was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the …"
1,Le Tambourin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It’s your only choice when visiting the Van Gogh Museum, as you can’t leave and come back with a timed-ticket, so luckily the food is great. The relaxing atmosphere is a welcome reprieve from the madness of the very popular museum. The food …"
2,Le Tambourin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place to take a health and flavour food. You can see the museum plain gardens when you eat. The staff is very kindly.
3,Le Tambourin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a wonderful restaurant, a true treat in the museum! They have a wide selection of all kinds of dishes and the seating area is beautiful."
4,Le Tambourin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, delicious fruit juices but very expensive.. It is inside the van gogh museum, first floor. You pay only by card"
5,Le Tambourin, 5 stars ,11 months ago,After seeing the museum my friend and I stopped in for coffee while we waited for our friends. The head chef came out and chatted with us for a while and gave us some complimentary snacks. Great experience.
6,Le Tambourin, 1 star ,2 years ago,Saw a rat this morning and told the staff. We took a picture but it wasn't very clear as the rat was hiding. The staff even said post it in fb. When we finish walking inside the museum the restaurant is full of people eating there.
7,Le Tambourin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I think a lot of the reviews for this place are quite old. It is clear since then that they have taken the criticism and used it to greatly improve! The atmosphere is amazing with bright open windows, relaxing music. It is not too echoey so …"
8,Le Tambourin, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The cafe's food is poorly displayed (flies and vegetables that had seen better days) coffee machine produces low quality watery coffee. The juice was flavourless, more unblended carrot than juice; for €4.75 worth of fresh juice I expected …"
9,Le Tambourin, 1 star ,2 years ago,BEWARE!! Check your items or receipt before paying!! Cashier charges the wrong amount but we only managed to get a portion of our money back as they made a mistake again on our refund. They took our receipt and they refused to give it to us. The manager here is a joke.
10,Le Tambourin, 1 star ,4 years ago,Visit the Van Gogh museum but don't bother with the restaurant. Small portions of bland food outrageously overpriced.

24,Le Tambourin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,(Translated by Google) It is an alternative to eat something not very formal after visiting the museum. It is a buffet coffee where you pay for what you take from the different counters according to the type of food they offer that day. The …

26,Le Tambourin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) If you want a nice, quiet and cheap bite to eat, then the restaurant of the Van Gogh is recommended. Because the Van Gogh is open until 7 pm, you can enjoy a quick bite here. With a museum pass you walk in, down the …"
