0,YIP Fellows, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Enjoyed some cold beers outside with great views of Dam Square. Our server was super friendly and attentive. Would definitely come back again. Inside was a little dark but they do have some nice indoor seats near the front windows. Didn‚Äôt try any food but the beer was cold, fresh and served in the proper glass!"
1,YIP Fellows, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I ordered a beer and snacks. One friend ordered hot chocolate. Everything was almost 30 euros. They kicked us out of the place because we were 5 people and ""everyone needs to drink"". I wanted to drink more beers but I get out because did what the waitress asked me to do. Just leave. They don't deserve any money!"
2,YIP Fellows, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Honestly a great place. They where so nice and welcoming even though we where a bit drunk and singing very loudly to the great music. When the barman came over to me i thought he was going to give out to me for the noise but instead he asked if we had any song requests. Can not recommend this place enough.
3,YIP Fellows, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff.. lovely ambience..great choices and loved the crowd there
Recommend this place highly especially if you are a tourist
They even got us a taxi back to the hotel"
4,YIP Fellows, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Way too expensive and about the double price of any other normal bar in Amsterdam. 7 euro for a small Kilkenny beer and 8,50 for a medium size white beer on tap. They are open late, until 3 AM, which is later than most bars and they ‚Ä¶"
5,YIP Fellows, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Outrageously expensive bar. ‚Ç¨22 for one Jameson, one Bombay Sapphire and one small bottle of tonic water. I mean come on. Absolute joke! Looks like a nice cosy bar from the outside but when you‚Äôre inside they play cheap loud party music. Does not match the setting of the bar. Avoid at all costs!!"
6,YIP Fellows, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I was traveling solo when I was last in Amsterdam which can be a little lonely. Luckily I met Davey the bartender. He‚Äôs a lovely dude that made my lonely trip a lot more positive. Thanks for the company Davey!
7,YIP Fellows, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Overpriced, 250ml water for 3.5 euros? Seriously?
Their waitress was very rude. ‚Ä¶"
8,YIP Fellows, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good location, nice atmosphere. But extortionate pricing at ‚Ç¨4.80 for a small lager (around ‚Ç¨3 everywhere else)"
9,YIP Fellows, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Why anyone would give this place less than 5 stars I have no idea. Prices are good. It‚Äôs not touristy, but filled with locals, so that should tell you something."
10,YIP Fellows, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Gave me a broken pint, no apology, no new beer. Poured the same beer in to a new pint. For a sober customer this place was terrible. 9‚Ç¨ pint of beer..."
11,YIP Fellows, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Good location but I think 8 euros for a medium sized Heineken is way too expensive!
12,YIP Fellows, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Waitress was very friendly and suggested dishes on the menu.  Food  was tasty. Reasonably priced
13,YIP Fellows, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Over 21 Euros for two rum and cokes is crazy, ridiculously expensive, even for Amsterdam! Wouldn't recommend unless you have money to burn."
