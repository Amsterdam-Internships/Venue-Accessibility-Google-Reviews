2,Cafe Keppler, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A cozy little cafe that is quintessentially Dutch. Located in Amsterdam-Noord, this cafe is a great choice for brunch and some good coffee! It’s not a tourist-heavy spot and so the atmosphere is pretty laid back and relaxing. Make sure to carry a Dutch bank card or some cash, as they don’t accept any other form of payment."

14,Cafe Keppler, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely atmosphere, good coffee, delicious food, especially a fan of their pies. Only sad thing that they're closed on Mondays and that they don't allow laptops, which I guess is also a win in most situations to be honest."
