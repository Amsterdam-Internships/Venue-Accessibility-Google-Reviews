50,Meet & Eat, 1 star ,3 months ago,They seem to think the restaurant is a discotheque. The background music is is way too loud. The weight staff is more interested in BS'ing each other than serving the customers.

87,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,10 months ago,Food was very good and the service was good but not quite great. Overall an above average experience and would eat here again.

143,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I found this place completely on accident, and wow, what a happy accident. The Athens Fries were an amazing spin on poutine that I would have never thought of, the Steak on a Leaf salad was one of the best salads I've ever had, and my …"
144,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great salmon omelet and the veggie pesto combo is also very good. I like their home fries and the coffee is dark and rich. And that is just breakfast! For midday and evening optios they have delicious tacos and a fantastic tap lineup. We …

149,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We ended up eating here twice over our long weekend in Sacramento. They have a great beer selection and an imaginative menu. The service was attentive and helpful. The restaurant is clean with a modern feel. We would definitely eat here again!
150,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food. Service was good. They were attentive at times and then let you be to eat..i like that. They have indoor our outdoor and even outdoors your not in a totally exposed space. Very nice menu and I really enjoy fhe variety. We had …
151,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"So many choices to eat and drink, all of them good, and even real shakes. A little noisy if there are parents who don't know how to control their brats. Love the Philly cheese steak with a side of garlic fries, the garlic fries look …"
152,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,4 months ago,As Good as before the pandemic with such an increase in price that I will think twice about going again.
153,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We've been going here since they've opened and the food is good BUT the staff definitely needs to be fine tuned. Waiters and waitresses are respectful; however, runners are disrespectful and incredibly rude!!! Have experienced this 3 times …"
154,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really enjoyed this place. My GF and I stopped in here for a quick bite to eat. Parking can be a bit tricky as there are not many spots at the restaurant itself, and the neighborhood seems to be saturated with 1-hour parking signs …"
155,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was awesome. Sat straight down around 630 pm dinner with friends...good beer selection had dub IPA ""blood on the track"" super good. For food had the sunny burger...cooked perfectly medium rare with an over easy egg...the egg wasn't really runny but still good... overall great food and experience would definitely come back"
156,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"For what they serve the prices are little high, probably because of farm to fork or the ingredients sourcing that they do. Lamb/beef burger was little dry or its a very lean blend. Hot wings are on the small side and not worth. 2 private …"
157,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great experience. Nice full menu of different types of foods. Great service start to finish. Good portion size for the price and nice atmosphere. The chicken club is a good choice. The cookie sundae dessert is a little different...just alright.
158,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place with huge portions of delicious foods. They have a large burger menu and good variety of salads. Staff was friendly and attentive and the dining space was well apportioned with modern decor. I can't wait to try more things on the menu!
159,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is good. I have had dinner there twice and lunch once. The breakfast menu looks good and I am looking forward to trying that. I give this place three stars because last time I was there I waited almost an hour for a table, it seemed they were understaffed. The place is loud. So  talking is difficult."
160,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Love coming here. It had an amazing atmosphere and overall feel. The food and service I've experienced is always amazing and makes me want to come back. Food is well portioned and plated. It's also a bonus just knowing all the ingredients where locally grown. An amazing overall restaurant.
161,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"amazing food. service was okay. server must've been having a rough day. this place still gets 5 stars though, for sure. everyone has their off day. def recommend this place to eat at. mimosas were boooooomb and the food was absolutely delicious. great place."
162,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice casual restaurant.  If you want a huge salad this is YOUR place.   Their Philly Cheese Steak was also HUGE and served with the best fries.   Lots of seating, watch the meter for your parking, you will get ticketed.  Great for all ages and families."
163,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Pleasant enough, and good burgers (very good fries), but the service was incredibly slow and the price seemed out of proportion. Salmon burger was not good at all and was $15.  Still, it's pretty inside (though metal chairs on concrete …"

165,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place is great. Option to sit inside or out on the patio. We opted for the patio since it was nice outside. There is plenty of shade and fans blowing to keep you cool. I ordered the Shrimp Tacos. Comes with 3 big tacos. All of the …

167,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"You might end up paying more for a burger, but it is well worth it.  Meet and eats commitment to provide a refreshing dining experience should be known by the locals.  The food is simply fantastic, and atmosphere is usually good.  Service could be better."
168,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Had the Philly Steak sandwich and it was very tasty. Nice touch of garlic sauce. Fries were reminiscent of the ones at In-N-Out.   Beer descriptions weren't really adequate to make an informed choice and the young servers couldn't really offer much help.  Service was also sub par overall. Interior design is very modern and hip.
169,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I really liked this place! It's a fun and funky place to get hipster type food, espresso and microbrews. There's a wide variety of beers on tap and the food is pretty good, I'd say it's kinda pricey but it's next to a fancy neighborhood so that makes sense. They have a kids menu which kept my little one happy!"
170,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Easy to find, parking available, open floor plan with an option to sit on a patio (heaters for cold weather), friendly & attentive service. Food arrived sooner than expected, but not too fast. Americano (coffee beverage) was good, fries were delicious and our cheeseburger was tasty! First time visiting. Will be back."
171,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Glad to see another non chain restaurant in Sacramento. I like the layout of the place as well as the decor. In lieu of antlers on the wall they have plants growing in the shape of antlers. Gotta love it. …
172,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic beer selection! Always many tasty brews to choose from. I always get the pork belly tacos, and they are always out of this world amazing! Great staff, great environment, they are usually busy because they are so good."
173,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Hands down customer service was great, but I got a lamb burger and it was so overcooked and dry and I asked for medium rare. the garlic fries were decent but only partially of the fries had garlic."
174,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This place does a decent job of making some tasty burgers, sandwiches and salads. There are some vegetarian options too, such as the Budda tacos. I like the spicy shrimp salad. Much like a vermicelli noodle bowl at a Vietnamese restaurant, …"
175,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Meet and Eat is a great local neighborhood eatery. Nice atmosphere inside and on the patio. My favorite is their fish and spicey shrimp tacos. Their breakfasts are also very good. Parking can be a bit of a challenge though. Their parking …
176,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I loved my date goat cheese omelette. However my husband ordered medium eggs and received medium raw. Our server did not offer any drinks after bringing water. The atmosphere is lively, a great cross-section of the community."
177,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to eat with lots of variety. High quality food items with many organic and vegan options. It has a casual atmosphere and offers outdoor seating. Pricing is very reasonable for the types of items that are offered. I will most definitely be back.
178,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was okay. Service was a bit scattered. Young staff which gave awesome energy, but simple things like refills and check-in were missed.  Also, our waitress put a steak knife directly in front of a toddler stead if passing to one of the adults. :("
179,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Loved, loved , loved !!!! The waiters were so sweet and accommodating to our party. Expect a return visit from me thr next time I'm in Sac to visit my daughter"
180,Meet & Eat, 2 stars ,3 years ago,They use plastic cups for water. The food is just okay. They are trying too hard to be cool.
181,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I ordered the fish and chips.  They were willing to give me onion rings instead fries.  However, the rings were doughy with overly thick batter and it appeared they added batter over a previously battered fish.  Not their best performance.   I've had great salads and sandwiches in the past"
182,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Love this place, good excuse for a business trip."
183,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I love this place !!! One of my favorite resturants for brunch or lunch! I haven't tried their dinner yet, but I am sure it is amazing too! I have never had a meal here I didn't like. They have a variety of tacos and eggs benedict to choose …"

186,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was great, loved the design and the staff was great.  A little pricey but it's quality food, think I will get a regular mimosa next time.The strawberry one was good but didn't enjoy the texture, however with fruit puree I should have expected it. All in all I will return and will recommend it to others."

188,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent! The food is fresh and delicious; even on Whole 30, it is so easy to find an approved meal on their menu, without many substitutions! All the staff are so kind and joyful, especially our waitress, Elinor! Will definitely be coming back!"
189,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The breakfast, service, decor and ambiance here is stellar! The flavor and freshness of the ingredients, the preparation of the food, and the coffee... was far beyond expectations and well worth price. Can't wait for my next visit!"

191,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really enjoy this spot fast and fresh food great beers on tap great and friendly service...
192,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best way to judge a burger is if the patty itself tastes good alone, and Meet and Eat's definitely does. Their burger beyond the bun is absolutely delicious. Everything is always fresh and I have yet to have a bad meal there."
193,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We live in Wisconsin and have eaten here for two years when we come out to visit our kids! Fantastic food for dinner and breakfast, large portions and so fresh and delicious!! Servers are so nice! Oh!! And dessert is yummy!!"
194,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very clean restaurant with beautiful live plants all over the property. Family/children friendly. Out of the 6 plates of dinner, every plate was filled with fresh delicious food. The portion size was also enough to fill you up and then …"
195,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"This is a relatively new location that we just got around to trying. They lean heavily into burgers and fries, but have lots of other options on the menu too. I had the lamb burger and it was delicious served with shoestring fries.  Plenty …"

197,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is my favorite place to consume!!! I go every Monday, as well as I attempt something various every single time and also the food is scrumptious. The morning meal, the hamburgers, veggie pastas, salads, treats, regional red wines and …"
198,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had an excellent experience with staff and food was on point! Got the western burger, loved the restaurant vibe & it was quick for a party of 5. We came from out of state, wanted to try something known to the area. Will be back!"
199,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is consistently good, especially the fries.  Service is never far from good.  Nice rotating beer selection, and tasty coffee too.  Everything seems to cost about $2-4 more than it should, though, imho."
200,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I like this place for the crispy fish tacos. So good! Wasn't impressed with the eggs Benedict. Hollandaise sauce was too sweet. And the green tea milkshake tasted like birthday cake, which I'm not a fan of."
201,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great food and Service.. our new local breakfast spot for sure!
202,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First time visit. I had the pork belly sandwich. Could have been a little less sauce but it was delicious. Went for lunch and breakfast was available, too. I will definitely return."

We made a reservation  for 20 and good thing only 13 of us showed up or it could have been way worse!!! Obviously they can't handle large groups.... drink order …"
204,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Local joint bringing the farm to fork ethos home. The beer is entirely crafts from around California, and their food is fresh, creative, and rich. Pictured below, their newest burger, the ""Mexican Village,"" featuring a chorizo patty topped with a giant grilled prawn, grilled poblano chile, queso fresco, guacamole and tortilla strips."
205,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"American food, awesome. I give this place double thumbs up. The service here is attentive. The place has a cool atmosphere. I can see why they have a lot of positive reviews."
206,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Food was great I got the breakfast burger, atmosphere was chill, but I ain't like the Mimosa drink I got it was a mix in which it was worth getting that's why it's 4.3 outta 5"
207,Meet & Eat, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Worst eggs Benedict of my life this far. The hollandaise tasted unlike any hollandaise sauce I had eaten before. It tasted like they just squirted yellow mustard over the top of over cooked, nearly hard yoked poached eggs, ham, and an …"
208,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food. If you're looking for a place with phenomenal fish and chips or mozzarella sticks, this is your place. The rest of the menu and food looked spectacular. The best salad and fish tacos were delicious as well."
209,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I'm old school,not into hipster stuff or vegan stuff. But I like spicy. So tried the spicy veggie spaghetti and omg it was the bomb"
210,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good food and good draft beer. I generally try to stay away from being a creepy cougar, and I'm happily married to a great man, but the waiter we had was a flirt and he gave me a free beer. How am I supposed to resist feeling a …"

Only problem is the noisy metal chairs scraping across the concrete floors."

214,Meet & Eat, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Very disappointed.  Staff was more interested in counting out tips than serving customers.  5-6 stood behind counter doing nothing, laughing and amusing each other ignoring customers.  I got no water refill following food delivery to table. …"

217,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is solid. Service is inconsistent: sometimes excellent, sometimes lacking. Beer list is a good size, but tends towards the NorCal bias of IPA, DIPA and hazy IPAs. Temple Coffee served here and we'll brewed."
218,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was fantastic, but service was problematic. We may have simply been overlooked, but we didn’t see our server for quite a while, and some time passed before someone else stepped in with water and coffee refills.  I’ll still go back — even the best have an off-day."
219,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best meal I have had in a while. Attention to detail stands out. Everything is prepared to exceed your expectations. Highly recommend.

221,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best eggs Benedict I've ever had. A huge breakfast and coffee menu to select from. Tons of options and great indoor / outdoor seating. Would come here anytime any day.
222,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food! Would give 5 stars, if only the service was better. Servers need to be trained by people who know how to provide good table service."
223,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Parking lot is small, but I just park in nearby neighborhood.  All of their food is good and a little unique.  Nice place to meet friends or date.  Inside or outside seating.  Gets crowded on weekends"
224,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Came here for the first time and the employees were very inviting and friendly. Our waiter did not get annoyed when we took forever to order, but was super patient with us. The food is on the pricier side, but it’s worth it. Highly recommend!"
225,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good food but had to wait close to 15 min before a waiter took our order... BTW I had to walk to the oblivious male host to say something. We hadn't been served water.
226,Meet & Eat, 1 star ,3 years ago,"While the food here may be well-sourced, it is poorly cooked and fairly overpriced. Ordered the spicy stone age omelette, and was left very unsatisfied. The dish came with sliced ""Philly"" steak strips on top. I put Philly in quotations …"
227,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really amazing service, good food. Most of their food is made in house and you can tell by the flavor and freshness. A little expensive, but definitely worth the cost for the amount of good food you get!"

233,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is always great but service is like a roller coaster of a ride with a lot more downs than ups, if could get consistent would come here regularly.  The temperature inside was freezing as well at my last visit and I normally do not get cold anywhere I go."
234,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good seasonal items,truffle season! Pork belly sandwiches n homemade soups n salads,all really fresh🤤 plus great desserts 4rm Freeport bakery rite up the road👍"
235,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Their burgers are usually on point but this time the lamb burger was a miss. It's supposed to be cooked to medium because they don't do medium rare but it was well done.  I won't knock them this time because we came in very close to closing but I've got my eye on them.
236,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful food! I had the pork tacos, and honestly the strangest highlight I can give is the amazing cilantro creme sauce. The corn torillas were a good addition, and thr prok was prepared just right. I would one back as soon as I could, it is a fantastic (if a bit pricy) choice not far outaide of Sacramento's main drag."
237,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place was great! Service was perfect. Food was interesting and delicious! People I went with had the date and goat cheese omelet and I had the Caucusus lamb burger. All of it was super good!  Will be back fo sho!

Salad was bomb (I added chicken) and the mozz wasn't bad for being just fried …"

241,Meet & Eat, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great breakfast and burger options.
242,Meet & Eat, 2 stars ,3 years ago,I'm not terribly impressed. We came in and they made us wait for a table even when there were ten clean ones. The food came before the drinks. The food didn't come all that the same time. And the food was just ok. Meh.
243,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Grilled Cheese and bacon Benedict was delicious. Fries and diced potatoes were a bit disappointing. Burgers are huge. So many more menu items I want to try.

247,Meet & Eat, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is wack. So overrated. The food is mediocre at best and it's way too expensive. The staff is good and it's a nice location, but you can do better than this. Don't spend your money here unless youre starving and can't get to some better restaurants in midtown."
248,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food! Lots of options. Great staff very friendly and attentive. I wish I could by there salsa to take home.  We will definitely go there again.
249,Meet & Eat, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A really nice neighborhood restaurant. Specializing in burgers, sandwiches, salads and a nice selection of classic entrees.  A really nice space and good value for money.  It's kid friendly but nice enough for a casual date."
250,Meet & Eat, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Super hipstery place and over priced. I ordered and egg omelet with cheese and mushrooms got 20% egg 20% cheese and 60% basically raw mushrooms. The potatoes on the side were undercooked and starchy but unfortunately the best part of the meal. Also I was served cold toast, not sure how your even achieve that."

A real shame as the food was fantastic .
257,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,3 years ago,This is my first time at Meet and Eat. The mushroom burger is good but the phili steak sandwich was disappointed. It heartly any meat inside. It feels like subshop sandwich only bread.
258,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,11 months ago,"Delicious, but unclear check-in process and only a couple seats available for the long wait times while tables are slowly cleared."
259,Meet & Eat, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The area and feel are nice. The food is over priced and not very good. I had mahi tacos that smelled like old fish and garlic fries, I swear the garlic was raw."
