1,The Old Church, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Nice little venue! It goes without saying that churches have some of the best acoustics given their shape, but the renovations here were done exceptionally well for the audio."
2,The Old Church, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Michael Allen Harrison Christmas concert was amazing. Covid restrictions in place yet comfortable venue with a fairly quick entry. The sound was awesome all afternoon. So glad to have seen the lovely inside of the Old Church.
3,The Old Church, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Lovely charming building with good acoustics. A great venue. Friendly staff. Vac and masks required. Not much room for social distancing.
4,The Old Church, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,A friend and I met up here for a one wo(man) show to see Miss Coco Peru.  The venue was amazing and historic well-kept etc etc.  It made me wonder why I never continued my architecture studies having loved that factor of the venue as well.

9,The Old Church, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What a special venue. The acoustics, as one can imagine, are simply fantastic. Such a beautiful atmosphere to listen to music in.

14,The Old Church, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"An amazing, small, intimate venue!! The acoustics complemented the musician harmoniously.

Thank you Van Hunt for bringing us to the Old Church Concert Hall!!"
15,The Old Church, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"What a COOL venue! So pretty, very unique. Super strict with COVID protocol. Drink option was WEAK. Drinks cut off early."

37,The Old Church, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had our wedding ceremony here at the end of July, and it was perfect! Gina was amazing to work with and went out of her way to let us stop by (multiple times) to check out the space. The ceremony itself went perfect, and our dog was …"
38,The Old Church, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Admittedly I am biased toward this venue as my grandmother was crucial to its restoration.  That said, it's a lovely space to see a concert, and I'm sure the same can be said for a church service.  Great acoustics and an intimate performance space."
39,The Old Church, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Beautiful acoustics, ADA friendly, easy parking"
40,The Old Church, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Our second time attending a wedding here. It's nice for a ceremony. I like the stage. Its made for a smaller production which is fine but they absolutely need some way to amplify the voices of the people speaking. Both weddings I attended I had to make up words they might be saying. It is so difficult to hear anything.
41,The Old Church, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Quite possibly one of the best concert venues I've ever attended.  As the name suggests, this is, in fact, and old church.  It is a very ornate, opulent church.  There is a HUGE pipe organ from 1882, and at the concert we attended, there …"
42,The Old Church, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great acoustics at this venue and space.
43,The Old Church, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Saw the posies there and it's a really lovely space. If you're handicapped, there's an elevator, but it was locked and I decided I'd rather chance the stairs than miss more of the show. Sight lines are great and you can buy a drink.  The steinway also was in tune and gorgeous."
44,The Old Church, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The space has beautiful interior (and exterior) architecture that really creates an atmosphere. For it truly being a building designed to be a church, when I attend events here I don’t get an overwhelming sense of religion from the space. …"
45,The Old Church, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A great use for a former church. It would have gotten five stars but the seating is the original pews.
46,The Old Church, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good concert venue. Very nice acoustics, a beautiful organ as a backdrop, pretty good sightlines from almost all seats, and they've finally put in small plaques giving seat numbers so assigned seating is now the norm (almost always used to be open seating)."
47,The Old Church, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Went to see and hear Tuvan throat singers in the Old Church Concert Hall tonight. Fabulous. Great acoustics. Lovely venue. You can purchase  beer, wine, hard cider, herbal teas, & yummy cookies there."
48,The Old Church, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a great room to see shows. I've been about 4-5 times now. Occasionally I've had challenges hearing lead vocals or jokes that performers are telling when they are talking, but I imagine that has more to do with the speaker array …"

54,The Old Church, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Show was wonderful, convenient parking! But mostly I have to complement the staff on there gracious handling me me in my scooter.  Took me down to the handicapped bathroom in the little elevation.  Could not have been kinder!  Thank you so much!"
55,The Old Church, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I never knew that this church was not a functional church but instead a music venue. The sound guy did a great job with both groups we saw (Tomo  Nakayama, and Lenore.).  The pews all had cushions so it was still fairly comfortable, and the …"
56,The Old Church, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Whether you are listening to music having a drink or just walking around this is an amazing place to visit. Sometimes the best time to go is when there's nothing going on and just walking around. But it's the acoustics are amazing.
57,The Old Church, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What a beautiful church!!  We were lucky enough to take in the Christmas  At the Old Church Concert with Michael Allen Harrison.  Incredible music to a STO audience.  A definite stop if you're here on the Christmas Holiday!

94,The Old Church, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Deliciously moody place for live music. Not a bar and so concessions are essentially snacks from a box but who cares when you have a location like this for listening.
95,The Old Church, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Not so sure about the church but the parking lot next door is fantastic. Really firm ground for parking my car. Also a perk that Jesus protects your car from car jackers.

100,The Old Church, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"WA Governor Jay Inslee with a quick stop. Likely the most educated Presidential candidate regarding climate change, but preaching to the choir in the PNW. Question is how can he do garnering support in carbon generating Texas, the industrial midwest and the political boxing ring that is the northeast."
