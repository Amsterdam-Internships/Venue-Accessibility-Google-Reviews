0,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Excellent food! Awesome menu options, good coffee and great views of the canal... would highly recommend for a crafty breakfast or lunch spot... we had Dutch eggs (without ham) and they were delicious!"
1,Prins Heerlijk, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"The restaurant is close to the train station, that is the only good thing it has. The food was below average and portions were small. The prices are way too high for the quality and size delivered. Staff were not friendly either, which …"
2,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very good! Good food, good atmosphere, nice service. Good if you are waiting for your train, since it’s so close to Amsterdam Centraal. Crispy croissant, good coffee."
3,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food for the price, but small venue. If you are looking for a good meal at a reasonable price, this is the place to go. If you are in a group it's not so great. The restaurant is very small. So you will need to be open to eating …"
4,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I loved this restaurant. We went to Amsterdam on a couple's weekend getaway and ate breakfast the here three days in a row. The restaurant is small, so I recommend it for small groups only. However, we had minimal wait for the two of us …"
5,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,a month ago,"If you are in Amsterdam you have to visit this place !

Lovely Service …"
6,Prins Heerlijk, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"First issue was poor service. We sat around fairly long until we figured we may order at the counter. Which wasn't necessary, they simply didn't notice us apparently. Then after we ordered and got our coffee we were asked whether we would …"
7,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic little cafe with great staff.  My family and I (5 in total) had breakfast here 3 days whilst on a recent vacation.  Delicious food at great prices and great portions.  Fantastic quick friendly service from the staff also.
8,Prins Heerlijk, 2 stars ,6 months ago,The Pancackes weren’t good and not fresh. The stuff wasn‘t friendly and bearly did their job:(
9,Prins Heerlijk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was alright, nice but a bit plain. There was an extra fee of 2% when paying with card that wasn't advertised nor stated on the receipt, bad practice in my opinion. I wasn't that friendly viewed when I informed the staff of my opinion. Alright, but there are much better places like this in Amsterdam."
10,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"amazing breakfast, you MUST try it, opens very early across the street from centraal amsterdam stop, best eggs and coffee I had in Amsterdam, very friendly and fast staff, almost always full. must try their signature chicken sandwich"
11,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best coffee in Amsterdam! The service was great! I would have eaten here everyday had I discovered it earlier! Obssessed with the poffertjes made better with strawberry and nutella! The english breakfast was great too and so was the salmon!
12,Prins Heerlijk, 1 star ,6 months ago,I am a student and I don't even eat such a mediocre breakfast. Coffee is also quite expensive.
13,Prins Heerlijk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"You should never eat a burger in this place, it tastes horribly, truly. Worse than McDonald's and stuff like that. Really low quality ingredients, (low quantity also: one small piece of lettuce and tiny tomato slice). Never ever again. And …"
14,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Small Café where you can get Breakfast and All-Day Snacks such as Toasties, Pancakes and Burgers. Their coffee was great and the ladies working behind the counter did a great job when it comes to service."
15,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Very chilled environment. Kept the customers very cosy and warm despite the terrible weather outside. Food was also very lovely and prices don’t hurt your purse strings.
16,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely love this place, really small but very friendly staff and super tasty food, it's just about 5 minutes by walk from centraal station."
17,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food, delicious hot drinks and good service. However, I was disappointed by the dessert, having a dislike for nuts, the chocolate was more nuts than chocolate and thus not really appreciated."
18,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Good for a full english breakfast.
Portion is good for the price.
Small restaurant, it's best to sit outside, when the weather is nice."

24,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Clicks taken during a canal cruise tour at Amsterdam central !!! 12 Euros per head, worth the money"
25,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious! But this is not what traditional english Breakfast looks like and the bacon is too salty.

30,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Has the most amazing uitsmijter (ham, eggs, cheese on toast). Sometimes I have flashbacks to that most amazing breakfast and want to jump on the train and travel the 5 hours just so I can walk down from the train station to Prins Heerlijk and experience it again. Whenever I go to Amsterdam it’s a must visit place if you can get a seat."

36,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Prompt service. Good food. Visited for the second time. Highly recommended
37,Prins Heerlijk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The breakfast tasted like something I would make in a hurry in the mornings while I am late to work. Not at all flavourful and not worth it.

44,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really great coffee and breakfast! I ordered the salmon and eggs and a cappuccino. As with all the restaurants near city center, a bit pricey. To be expected, and the portions are good for the price. My only warning is that it's best to eat …"
45,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place to go for full English brekkie although I'm not sure lettuce belongs on the plate. Food fresh and tasty, service v good"
46,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely loved this place. There isn’t a lot of seating, but if you manage to snag a spot you’ll be treated to great service, great food, and a lovely view of the streets of Amsterdam. The staff here was so nice and friendly, and everyone …"
47,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Good range of products , student discount available, cozy space"
48,Prins Heerlijk, 1 star ,4 months ago,"When you order an Fanta orange, you get an orange juice, and when you order a tuna sandwich you get a boring bread without salat"
49,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What a great find - we were able to try authentic Dutch food here at this little gem. The poffertjes were my favourite - tried it the original way with powdered sugar. Also enjoyed both the pancakes and croissant. The staff were also very nice and welcoming. Overall, I would return."

56,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great breakfast! Despite the small size we still managed to snag a table. Great food, would go again. The English Breakfast was a great deal and pretty tasty. If you ask for water they bring bottles you have to buy just an FYI."
57,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Me and my boyfriend came here for breakfast. He got full English and I got veggie omelette without mushrooms. My omelette was very tasty, local cheese was a good add-on. …"
58,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A tiny, cornered, brunch restaurant, with bright smiling waiters ! The place is indeed tiny but so cosy, the food is excellent, the service is fast and the plates are biiiig ! If you are looking for a brunch in Amsterdam : THIS IS THE PLACE !"
59,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very friendly and accommodating service and great food too!

This is not an upscale establishment with fancy elaborate menus and complicated …"
60,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good breakfast place ! Near the central station! Staff was friendly !

64,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A very nice blond water, very helpfull and carismatic."
65,Prins Heerlijk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Small place but quite chill for the area it’s in. Friendly staff but nothing exceptional. As a vegan, it was quite bad food and both of us got sick after eating there so it says it all about the quality of the ingredients or how it’s cooked."
66,Prins Heerlijk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Ordered a cappuchino, paid a cappuchino, got a latte, and no options to put some cocoa on my coffe, weird... but the latte was good"
67,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I loved this place! Such a gem and the food was excellent! It is small but the warmth of the staff and the quality of the food served offsets this. I actually ended up here because another restaurant google recommended was closed and I was …

69,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,6 months ago,The proffertjes were good and the staff was friendly
70,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great food for the price. I wanted eggs and my wife wanted pancakes but most places I found only served one or the other while also carrying high marks to begin with but this place carried everything breakfast related and it was delicious. …
71,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice and tasty breakfast, big portions"
72,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Some of the best food in town. Hands down. Secret Menu is still a secret unless you know DJ Brown13.
73,Prins Heerlijk, 1 star ,6 months ago,Worst possible behaviour. They should do a basic course on how to serve the customers!
74,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing cafe. Good food, personable staff, Giselle was absolutely wonderful even though we broke a plate! Serves breakfast all day which is great, and also isn't overpriced! Definitely very small, not for big groups."
75,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious food for a great value in central Amsterdam.
76,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing. Got the veggie omelette and a flat white. A small space inside so be prepared to sit outside if needed. I loved the street around it. A nice little breakfast spot.
77,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Tasty food and fast service. It's a really small cafe with limited seating so had to wait around 15mins for a table but worth it. Perfect for breakfast!
78,Prins Heerlijk, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Not the best place to eat, poor sandwiches, wrong orders, you can find better for sure."
79,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Came here after omelegg (right around the corner) had closed after our delayed train. Burgers were excellent, quick, and reasonably priced. Good coffee and nice staff. Considering how close it is to the station it is certainly worth popping by for a quick meal between trains or on your way out of Amsterdam."
80,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Tried smoked salmon with egg. The food was yum. The hostess was very congenial. No meal is complete without the pancakes with butter. Lovely outdoor seating.
81,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Owner was very nice and the poffertjes were great! Only the price was a little too high for our taste, although quite normal for where the little (very limited seatings) cafe is situated."
82,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice place for a burger/sandwich. I was there for dinner, think it would be better for lunch tho. I had the big burger, it was really tasty.
The salmon sandwich also looked really nice. Great location and really friendly staff. Recommend!"
83,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place,  nice and cosy. Stuff is super friendly, service is quick. Food was great, we had brunch here and all was really delicious! Thank you :)"
84,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff, decent Dutch and English breakfast, good coffee. Two things - utensils could be cleaner and POS terminal is bolted to counter,  so you can pay with your card only after walking up to it."
85,Prins Heerlijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Poor quality and service , avoid breakfast pancake at all cost"
86,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Located right outside the central station. Stopped by for lunch before leaving from the central station. Ordered the bigburger. Tasted pretty good. Had like big mac sauce on the burger. Service was nice. No bathroom available. Free wifi. Extra 2% for using credit cards.
87,Prins Heerlijk, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"A good breakfast cafe a stone throw's away from central station. This small cafe seems to be very popular as it serves all kind of food. You can get omelette, dutch pancake or sandwiches or just humble croissant. …"
88,Prins Heerlijk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Expensive and small portions. €7 for a small portion of yoghurt with barely a handful of granola. €3.70 for a coffee. Service wasn't great either. The food came out quickly, though."
89,Prins Heerlijk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The place looks nice, prices are a bit high. The problem was when I came, it took 10 minutes before someone take my order. And during all my stay, the workers were screaming to each other and the place was full of empty boxes on the ground... I hope they can fix their service."
90,Prins Heerlijk, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Worst price/value ratio, the sandwiches were a dry burger bun with the toppings on it"
91,Prins Heerlijk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Service is fast, seem friendly, but not as friendly..they ask money even for hot water xD water should be free imho and they open earlier than other cafes in the area(7:30) If you can wait until 8 I’d recommend going somewhere else for breakfast."
92,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice and cozy atmosphere, friendly waitress who has fun on his work.
Delicious and payable food, secret-tipp: the dutch pancake with banana and chocolate ;)"
93,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to have breakfast, just very close to the central station. Wide menu, very friendly staff, who were making sure to keep and eye on everyone even when it was busy."
94,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Brilliantly tasty food. Everything we tasted here was top notch. Small cute place right in the heart of the city with everything at a walking distance from.
95,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Ordered a pulled pork burger and my partner ordered a big burger. Both were good but it seems then pulled pork burger is just the big burger with an extra item. …
96,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very tasty! Ate here with my friends for over a week and it's all fresh and delicious. Although some meals are kinda weird especially the salads.
97,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The place is very comfortable and the food us delicious! We could feel a warm and joyful atmosphere created by the workers. Everything was perfect!
98,Prins Heerlijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"It was the blandest food i have ever gotten, and the ingredients for the salad were not ripe. Additionally, the food arrived after 40 minutes of waiting, when the restaurant was barely visited. Cannot recommend at all."
99,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great lil restaurant. We sat outside in the mid morning sunshine. Service was quick and kind. Huge serving of omelette. Awesome hot chocolate.
100,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,a year ago,Friendly staff. Decent breakfast. (Maple syrup is not the same as in the U.S if you want pancakes lol)
101,Prins Heerlijk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The dutch style eggs were good, dutch crepe was not that much food (only a thin crepe) for the money we paid. Quick and friendly service."
102,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I think I got type 2 diabetes by eating a Price Pancake, but it was ABSOLUTELY delicious. …"
103,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Variety of sandwiches, burgers and pastries in addition to coffee.

Great pricing and sufficient portions, burgers and fries available all day. Coffee and pastries available from about €5 and sandwiches and burgers from about €7.5"
104,Prins Heerlijk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Service OK, setting nice but portion sizes and food quality are poor, the full English had 2 cocktail sausages, the bacon was mostly fat and the toast was rock solid and cold"
105,Prins Heerlijk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The food is average quality, but burgers don't come with any sides. They won't let customers use their toilet, drink tap water, or pay with credit."
106,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great service and a wonderful English breakfast! The cafe is also really pretty and a great place to grab a bite before a journey!

111,Prins Heerlijk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Tasty! Absolutely tiny inside though. 50/50 chance of having to sit outside to eat. In my humble opinion one of the best spots in Amsterdam to people watch.
112,Prins Heerlijk, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing, small restaurant with very friendly staff, good food and big portions for the price."
113,Prins Heerlijk, 1 star ,2 years ago,I was very sick after eating there. I had huge stomack hack during many days and my girlfriend pucked. The worst food of amsterdam. Don t go in this place

119,Prins Heerlijk, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very tedious. Only exciting part was when our boat Captain hot the boat against the side of the canal 4 times in a row. The day improved when the 50 minute tour ended!
