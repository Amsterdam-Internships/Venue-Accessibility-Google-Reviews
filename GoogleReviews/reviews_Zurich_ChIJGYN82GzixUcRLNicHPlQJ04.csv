0,Zurich, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Café Zurich is on the edge of a large square, but far enough from the surrounding buildings for it to catch the sun. They have 2 large terraces, both with umbrellas and heat lamps for when the weather turns. There is also a small indoor …"
1,Zurich, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Celebrated my birthday here with family and it was absolutely amazing. The food was delicious, the interior warm and it was a nice plus we were sitting next to the open kitchen to see everything that went down. Service was very friendly and helpful. Definitely a good place to come with friends, family or for a romantic dinner!"
2,Zurich, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I went to Zurich for a bite to eat and sat at the bar. The atmosphere was cozy but not stuffy. Clean, and service was quick. The bartender didn’t say much but I was heavily invested into some work on my phone so I think he read into the …"
3,Zurich, 5 stars ,a month ago,Super cozy and nice place… food is also great!!! And I love their ginger lemon tea!!!
4,Zurich, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"My husband and I arrived here for a later dinner and enjoyed the atmosphere and warm fire. The place was decorated beautifully. We ordered appetizers - the Peking duck bao buns, salmon gravlax and bread with dips. They were delicious!"
5,Zurich, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Remarkable place, very friendly stuff and delicious breakfast.  Fresh, buttery and extra flaky croissants, perfect toast with eggs, cheese and ham.

6,Zurich, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We got here towards the end of the night and the kitchen had closed. However the waiter brought us some snacks to eat while we drank a few beers. Excellent service. …
7,Zurich, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a nice mellow time here, food was good, pricing was on point. The bonfire/fireplace area is awesome. Literally the best I've seen anywhere."
8,Zurich, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very cool interior design, with a centrally located open fireplace and open kitchen. Wine list is equisite and drinks in general recommendable. However, I could not recommend staying for food. Wait was very long and 3 out of 4 dishes were severely undercooked or tasteless. Staff is friendly but not very fast."
9,Zurich, 4 stars ,a month ago,Food was brilliant and the staff you couldn't fault at all .
10,Zurich, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place for fancy dining. We had a friend's birthday here and loved every part of it. The food is great (though if you're STARVING, you may want to order a bit more). Plenty of veggie options and also a lot of cocktails. Check it out!!"
11,Zurich, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Extremely mid experience. Feels like we could have gone to Albert Heijn and gotten a few beers and some finger food and eat it in the park, and the experience would have been 1/3 the price and honestly not much worse."
12,Zurich, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious good, great service, and cool music. This place is a must if you're in the area. The Amsterdam Mule cocktail was strong."
13,Zurich, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"The waiting staff was great. Truly, a nice team. They were friendly, helpful and result oriented. …"
14,Zurich, 1 star ,5 months ago,Yesterday we ordered two burgers. Me and my partner are now suffering food poisoning. A place to run away.
15,Zurich, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Went to Cafe  Zurich for an afternoon snack. Shared the club sandwich and had a beer in the sunshine out on the patio - I loved that there were separate patios for smoking and non-smoking. I would highly recommend the chicken club sandwich …
16,Zurich, 5 stars ,a month ago,Very nice and cosy place with amazing coffee ☕
17,Zurich, 4 stars ,10 months ago,One of the best terraces in Amsterdam to enjoy a drink. The menu is creative and very tasty. You'll see me there lots of times this summer.
18,Zurich, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for especially breakfast and lunch. In a non touristy erea
19,Zurich, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff and quite busy on a thursday night. Good food and a good beer assortment. They forgot to put in our dinner orders and we had to wait for about 45 minutes, but when they found out, we had the food in 5 minutes and they offered make up for it. They handled it very well! And the fish was excellent!"
20,Zurich, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Pet friendly, nice staff, good atmosphere, 2x big ""terrace"". Next time we'll try the food also."
21,Zurich, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Good food. Nice atmosphere. But had to wait more than an hour for our food
22,Zurich, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place overall; if you're looking for a chill place for a drink or some tasty, 'basic' food; go for it.  Staff could improve on speed of delivery, frequency of checking in with you and expectation management (when will what arrive), but …"
23,Zurich, 3 stars ,a year ago,"When the terrace is full, be prepared to wait for your (next) round of drinks. The staff is friendly but not very proactive as we had to flag them down (as they walked passed us) for every round we ordered. We didn't get a drink menu so we …"
24,Zurich, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful bar and restaurant located on the outskirts of Amsterdam.  A great place for groups and friends.  Warm , comfortable atmosphere and friendly waiting staff . Food is good but nothing special.  Beautiful building which is well …"
25,Zurich, 4 stars ,8 months ago,I like this place a lot for a quick activity in the neighbourhood! Nothing special in terms of eating but still a very good option for the days you don’t want to go downtown!
26,Zurich, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice, delicious and tasty dinner. We were served by amazing Roberto(very nice, smiley and attention waiter). Only one thing I would maybe make bigger steaks(taste was awesome). Highly recommended!"
27,Zurich, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice decor, good food, a little pricey."
28,Zurich, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Place is nice, but we had a poor experience. The waitress forgot about our drinks, it took 40mins to bring two beers. The beef burger was the worst burger I ever had, the meat was really poor quality with shattered bone pieces inside it and …"
29,Zurich, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice place with good cocktails and sustainable straws really nice touch,also nice beers from what my friend told me"
30,Zurich, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, cozy and obviously very popular. Service needs improvement. Staff is not coordinated and you end up having 3 different people taking your order again and again. The female chef that works in the morning is doing an amazing job handling so many orders at the same time. I can see that because they have an open kitchen."
31,Zurich, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I really love this vibrant and cosy café. In particular, the service is great! They are friendly and cheerful, which I truly appreciate. The only downside is the acoustics. The building is round, so the sound echoes off the walls and that …"
32,Zurich, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A great place to drink and to eat. Very friendly staff who could tell us everything about the ingredients (my Girlfriend is highly Allergic). We ordered Burgers and it's the best BBQ Sauce I ate. It's on a good spot and you can't miss it
33,Zurich, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We had breakfast there 5 days. First day we had the best server ever anywhere.  The last say we had two very nice ladies.  Food was very good every time.  We recommend the food, and if you get the guy with the beard, the best service ever.  Clean restrooms."
34,Zurich, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The venue looks nice, although very loud music prohibits a chilled meal or drink.
The terrace is good and the food is good as well. …"
35,Zurich, 2 stars ,a year ago,The staff is nice however but the service was slow. The food was not great. The day after we all (we were 4 people) had bad stomach and nausea. And it was not very cheap either. I don't think I will go again there.
36,Zurich, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super friendly staff from the bar to wait staff,  and delicious food. The best service I’ve received in Amsterdam, hands down, which made all the difference for us having guests from overseas to visit. Hopefully my first trip of many to …"
37,Zurich, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Okay food and nice staff. They change the menu now and again. I like that, but about half a year ago I would rate Zurich higher for their amazing duck salad, which unfortunately did not make the cut in the current menu. Overall a good place to chill because the atmosphere is nice. I recommend the burger with truffle oil fries."
38,Zurich, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice location and great terrace, there is a normal smoker and smoke free location for all crowds. Inside decor is quite quaint and after their renovations they also do beer taps right on the tables. Sadly the place is overpriced and the selection is not great but if you're in the area on a summer day it's a great place to chill"
39,Zurich, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful place to have in the buurt. Good food and nice atmosphere
40,Zurich, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Took a seat today and the lady said she would clean the table which never happened.

41,Zurich, 1 star ,2 years ago,"My friends and I had been here once before. Tonight we had a new server first day on the job. She had no knowledge of the menu, she could not answer any questions we had. No fault of hers as I would not have known it was her first day had …"
42,Zurich, 5 stars ,a year ago,Steak tartar was really enjoyable and espresso martini was smooth.
43,Zurich, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is delicious and the space is lovely but they should be better organized with the orders. I have been there several times and the wait can be very long. Often someone who arrives after you is served before, which is really …"
44,Zurich, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is a big no no. You do need a starter, main and desert so you and up paying way to much for the the quality. The locations not so good. Basically for 2 persons spending 80/100 with some drinks and still need to go to the McDonald's afterwards."
45,Zurich, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Waited 1.5h for food, a bit to long! But service was friendly, and food and drinks were tasty."
46,Zurich, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A nice trendy bar with affordable prices. The service could be a bit faster but overall it was good. Music is very good, though a bit too loud at times to be able to have a conversation. It doesn't get in the way of your experience though."
47,Zurich, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy atmosphere, reasonably priced drinks, burgers, snacks and meals. Looks like it can get busy and louder into the evenings. Great setting, away from the centre of Amsterdam"
48,Zurich, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to have a drink or eat, friendly staff and great atmosphere. The terrace is very nice and it sits in a privileged location in Mercatorplein. It is not cheap, and I do wish they had more variety of beers, otherwise the quality is good."

50,Zurich, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I had to redo my review from 3 years back and pull the star rating down from a 5 stars to a 2 star. The last 2 visits were very disappointing. Slow service, staff is obviously not on top of there game or overworked. We had to wait for …"
51,Zurich, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome atmosphere, service and food! This place was recommended to us and we were not disappointed at all. If you are somewhere near, just go here for dinner , cocktail or whatever. Just great!"
52,Zurich, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice restaurant with a good selection of foods and drinks
53,Zurich, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What a gem this is. It lifts the entire neighborhood. Great terrace. Eclectic menu with tasty dishes. Quite affordable to Amsterdam standards. Cozy atmosphere inside with a fire place.
54,Zurich, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice location in the middle of the Mercatorplein on the upcoming Amsterdam West. The guests are mostly locals and the cafe' is perfect for pretty much any occasions: you may have cocktail/wine in the evening with your partner; nice Brekky …
55,Zurich, 5 stars ,4 years ago,It's a warm cozy place to take in natural light and delicious food and drinks.
56,Zurich, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Good food but very bad service!
We were 3 people and we ordered aspargus, gambas with fries and a burger with fries. First of all the burger came very late and without any fries, same as the …"
57,Zurich, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food comes in small portions and isn't very good to begin with. It's also dark and noisy so only come here if you're planning to keep your dinner conversation to a minimum. Finally they have a very poor ventilation system so you'll leave smelling of bbq meat, which may or may not be your thing."
58,Zurich, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Did breakfast lunch and diner here and the food was great. Indoor and out door so perfect whatever the weather and staff were helpful and polite. Highly recommend visiting.
59,Zurich, 1 star ,5 months ago,Service was awful. Banana bread was fried with to much oil
60,Zurich, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"And this on the most controversial square, once know to all Amsterdam citizens for it's, hangjeugd. Our local name for no good kids hanging around in the streets. Good place, good food and nice atmosphere. Serving could be better. But he, it's Amsterdam for real."
61,Zurich, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I thought this place would be so different than it actually is. It’s a hip and young restaurant + bar. Good menu, great vibes. Perfect for dinner with friends."
62,Zurich, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Loads of local special beers.
Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.
Didn't try the food but it looked good. An open kitchen is always a good sign."
63,Zurich, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"This was one of my favorite venues when I was living in Amsterdam: food was very good and affordable, the menu changed often and the venue was really cozy. A round building with glass walls, was pleasant during summer (but with nice weather you'd rather sit outside) and even better during winter, with a cozy fireplace in the middle."
64,Zurich, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Nice place. Good food and good music.
65,Zurich, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best outdoor patios/terraces in the city during the summer. Due to its clever location, the square in front of Zurich is in the sunshine almost all day long. There's a wide selection of drinks available and the food is good …"
66,Zurich, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice cosy and trendy café/restaurant on the Mercator square in Amsterdam.

70,Zurich, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A nice trendy bar with affordable prices. The service could be a bit faster but overall it was good. Music is very good, though a bit too loud at times to be able to have a conversation. It doesn't get in the way of your experience though."
