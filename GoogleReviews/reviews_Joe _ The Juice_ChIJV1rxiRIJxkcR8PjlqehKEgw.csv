0,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We walk by here every day and treat ourselves with the most delicious drinks.
Or we order a delicious lunch here. Sandwich Spicy Tuna is a favorite! Guilty pleasure a banana bun for dessert. …"
1,Joe & The Juice, 4 stars ,a year ago,For breakfast we got 2 vegan acai bowls which were delicious. With granola and banana on top. Oatmilk Cappuccino and one Americano. To go 2 banana breads. Really good taste. Price is ok for Amsterdam. There are also 2 options of shakes with plant based milk and protein. Next time we will try it out.
2,Joe & The Juice, 4 stars ,a week ago,A nice location with plenty of seating available
3,Joe & The Juice, 3 stars ,2 months ago,"Lovely, friendly service. But Joe, please change ""Acaï bowl"" to ""Acaï cup"" and lower the price. 7,8 euro for a cup is way too much"
4,Joe & The Juice, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Joe & The Juice is a Denmark based juice shop that has opened a handful of branches in Amsterdam, including the recently opened shop along Runstraat. Opening hours are 8am to 7pm. …"
5,Joe & The Juice, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Somewhat dirty. Coffee options rather tame compared to my experience at Joe and the Juice in Copenhagen. Might be worth a visit if you are coming for the shakes/juice (which I didn't try).
6,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I had the vegan avocado sandwich and I really liked it. I also tried the re build 2.0 vegan shake and the vanilla rooibos tea, both were delicious."
7,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,a year ago,Real friendly guy being the bar. Cafe was nice and clean and loved the woody interior. Great vibes all round. Lots of vegan choices. Had an english breakfast tea with coconut milk that the guy warmed up too. Centrally located (8 min walk from Kalverstraat). Marked as a favorite on my Google maps and will definitely be visiting again.
8,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Like every other Joe & The Juice i've been to, this one is just the same and just as good. As always, I recommend the spicy tuna sandwich! You can't go wrong!"
9,Joe & The Juice, 2 stars ,3 months ago,The juices are good but it is unacceptable that they served them in plastic cups even for people who sit in the cafe. This doesn't match with your brand image.
10,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Avocado shake is very good .less sweet and filling
11,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great coffee place and hands down best coffee in town (they brew their own coffee). I love the staff - it’s always a pleasure having a chat with them!
12,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome brunch, I can recommend fully their Tuna avocado, Tuna jalapenos, and their Acai porridge. I love their shakes as well, all of them are great depending what you are in the mood for. I always also take a shot of turmeric or ginger to boost the immunity system."
13,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and drinks, had turkey sandwich with avocado and a power shake. Really relaxed atmosphere too. Highly recommended!"
14,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"I love the sadwiches. Perfect healthish snacks. Juices a bit exxy though.
The only problem is everytime I see one of this shops I wanna go in, doesn't matter if I ate already or not 😂"
15,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Of course, I am not comparing Joe and the Juice with 'niche' artisan coffee places (it will definitely lose), but for a cafe chain it is definitely 5 stars.
The coffee is good, the selection of sandwiches is very nice (stealing some …"
16,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to make a stop. Exactly the same thing than the Joe & The juice in the UK, but it was all that I excepted... So perfect! Same drinks, same quality, same atmosphere :) I particularly love the Energy shake."
17,Joe & The Juice, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Nice place but the staff could be friendlier
18,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Lovely coffee and nice staff
19,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing juices, highly recommended"
20,Joe & The Juice, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The juices are under-sized and expensive (€6.80). By comparison, the juice bar next to my work offers a large juice that is half as much more as a large juice here and it's only €4. The additional marginal cost of offering a more generous …"

22,Joe & The Juice, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great place, i highly recommend the spicy tuna sandwich!"

Muziek staat keihard tijdens de lunch en als je vraagt of de muziek iets zachter mag kijken ze je eerst aan of je een alien bent en daarna doen ze net of ze m zachter heb gezet maar volgens heeft m nog harder gezet…. Mij zie je hier nooit meer. Eerder een uitgaansplek dan een eetplek
