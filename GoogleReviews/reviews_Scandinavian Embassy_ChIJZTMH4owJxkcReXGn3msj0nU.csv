We tried many desserts and each one tasted like a piece of art. And the coffee …"
1,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"One of the best places we pass in Amsterdam. It’s A MUST to pass . Coffee , sweets are perfect and delicious. Staff are the most nice ones you may pass , friendly and helpful. Recommended 10/10"
2,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Very good coffee
The service need to improve"
3,Scandinavian Embassy, 2 stars ,a month ago,"Usually fine coffee, but the quality should be consistent and today it was not.. Had a take out cappuccino; milk to coffee ratio was off, temperature was off, texture was off. Putting a lid on it to hide all that was the worst. And no, it …"
4,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Not the best breakfast choice: no eggs, no porridge, 3 types of sandwiches. But tasty cinnamon buns and delicious ginger-lemon-honey infusion!"
5,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Love this place. Very good coffee and food, especially the cinnamon or cardamom buns if you get them fresh will make you want to return. Nice service, despite frequent long lines (a testament to the quality)"
6,Scandinavian Embassy, 2 stars ,a month ago,"Not quite sure what the hype is about. It's very expensive and while the coffee is good, the service is so slow and inattentive. So not worth the hype in my opinion.."
7,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I'm usually not a fan of cinnamon bun, but the cinnamon bun here is just amazing! it's not too sweet but still full of flavour. it's a bit crunchy outside but soft inside, which is a perfect combination."
8,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Visited during the family trip because local people highly recommended this place to us. My experience here was very good. It’s a cozy and nice place to be and their foods were amazing. We were lucky to sit in front of the chef cooking and …
9,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Cosy little place. Welcomed by very friendly staff.
10,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Cinnamon bun was incredible and the whole place smells like cinnamon!
Also staff was absolutely lovely!"
11,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"BEST CINNAMON ROLLS around! If not for anything else, that is enough reason to go. But the coffee was great, too, and the poached eggs with mushrooms tasted delicious. You can sit at the bar and chat with the guys, they are cooking all these wonders right in front of you. Very cool atmosphere and friendly, funny people."
12,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious muesli, both rich and light. Took a bit for wait staff to attend to me, however, they were gracious, kind and helpful once they did. Luckily I was in no rush! The coffee could have been a tad warmer (on a cold day)...despite these …"
13,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,5 months ago,The bread was good but coffee was not that great. I can’t explain why but the atmosphere was not that cozy for me
14,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,a month ago,High quality coffee in a high quality location. Small cafe but good for takeaway or on off-peak times.
15,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best coffee I have had in months. No idea how they can make their coffee so bold and rich. This small cafe is very busy, full of guests. Service is good and in time though many guests are waiting."
16,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Not a very extensive menu but cute little spot. Very solid cinnamon roll. Muesli was okay. Recommend ordering the cinnamon rolls right on arrival as they can take a bit.
17,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"One of my go to specialty coffee places in Amsterdam! Certainly the best one around the Pijp area. Next to delicious coffee, some sweet and savoury bites they also have a very friendly and knowledgeable staff."
18,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy place to disconnect and relax with a friend while having a coffee! The pies are simply awesome. However, they had run out of cinnamon rolls. It is usually a bit crowded and you need to wait a bit in order to have a sit."
19,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Small coffee shoy replete with passion to what they do. Always great friendly service. Getting busy (and hip) but again - their coffee just a killer :) get your drip, try their bakery and small but well made food selection, recommended!"
20,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Scandinavian Embassy has a different unique style from what people are used to! They're specialty is coffee! They have a variety from which you can choose from & the coffee there is strained! The staff is very friendly and their food is delicious! Good place for breakfast & lunch!
21,Scandinavian Embassy, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Although the food and drinks might be good. The trip to the toilet was one I will remember. Weird step that you forget while exiting. I fell, hurt my both ancles. …"
22,Scandinavian Embassy, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,"The place has good coffee, but the staff is not interested at all in customers. Not worth to try."
23,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Really great coffee, fantastic service. Lovely cinnamon buns. Super cozy sitting inside. My favorite cafe in Amsterdam"
24,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great service with great coffee. A little touch of Swedish/Danish hospitality goes a long way! Had the signature Daniela cup and also a lovely chat with said Daniela and the team incl. Mette! Would definitely visit again!
25,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Hands down best coffee in Amsterdam, and best coffee we found on our Euro trip. Their flat white was “transcendent” and reminded me of a top class brew from back home in New Zealand. Very hard to find in Europe. Very friendly staff who …"
26,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Went here twice during our stay in Amsterdam. Their filter coffee and their cinnamon buns are to die for. Excellent service. Will definitely come back the next time we're in Amsterdam
27,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"These guys are awesome. Been travelling and arrived with a pram and a big suitcase. Desperate for coffee. They welcomed us in, found us a place to put our stuff, served some amazing coffee and the most incredible cinnamon buns. Thank you!"
28,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I’m not a big coffee drinker, because I usually have to add a lot of sugar to make up for the bitter taste, but this coffee was AMAZING. So smooth and delicious, almost felt like butter. Their brunch menu is amazing too - had the Gravlax …"
29,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's a great place to start the day: calm music and that great smell of coffee. The service is good, and the food is excellent: very natural and well cooked. I strongly recommend it."
30,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,such a popular spot! we waited for quite a while (20-30 minutes) for a table. however they did not disappoint! they serve good food with very nice presentation. the salmon and poached egg was exceptional. their coffee and bread was also really good. price was fairly high.
31,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Incredible. The Best coffee I have had in Amsterdam. I had a cappuccino with oat milk that tasted like heaven. The waiter was very friendly and the food was delicious... Both the almond cake as well as the classic Scandinavian brekky with poached egg salmon and rye bread were worth every penny.
32,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice cafe in one of the most popular areas of Amsterdam.
Fast service.
Nice vibes and very well prepared coffee.
I recommend you to try it."
33,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,a month ago,Cappuccino not so good (and very small) but delicious Scandinavian pastries.
34,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice and stylish Place Go enjoy coffee. Small Portions - Good Price
35,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Good coffee, I like cakes here here — they have some special twist and there are some interesting drinks worth of trying. I liked cascara and tonic, which tasted a bit similar to espresso tonic, but was fruitier. The only thing is the queue, there are always people waiting to order there and this may take a while."
36,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"very popular place so it is packed most of the time, at the very back there is small part filled with light and very nice atmosphere. great coffee, also you can get beans of the Swedish Coffee Collective for around 15€."
37,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place. Awesome cinnamon rolls. Pumpkin porridge excellent. Blueberry and lavender w/tonic was wonderful. Nice friendly team. Will definitely be back.
38,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is fantastic,  the coffee is great and the food is excellent. The mushrooms/pancake dish was very good and the cinnamon buns were fluffy hot out of the oven. The interior is relaxed and inviting,  this will definitely be a place we frequent. We sat at the bar and watched them cook and prepare the dishes, very beautiful."
39,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 months ago,You won't be disappointed with the coffee there. One of my favorite places in Amsterdam for proper coffee.
40,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,Amazing coffee but too crowded and small to work at.
41,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"As someone obsessed with coffee, I really enjoyed the espresso coupled with a nice cinnamon bun. The atmosphere was spot on and the hot food cooking smelled amazing!"
42,Scandinavian Embassy, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible coffee. 4 of us came for a quick espresso, we were told to sit at the back on a bench and someone would come for our order. 25 minutes later, sitting next to dirty cups and boxes nobody came. Went to order directly at the bar and …"
43,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very good coffee and delicious Kanelbullar!

This place serves very high quality coffee and freshly made. Kanelbular (the …"
44,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"It is a pleasant place, limited menu, but excellent food. However a major flaw are two things - the chairs are painfully uncomfortable and hard (maybe this is some kind of attempt to reconstruct Scandinavian protestant frugality) and there …"
45,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"An ideal coffee shop for me in Amsterdam. The food, the flat white, the brew and the service are all nice. Enjoyed it very much!!"
46,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This coffee shop/café is situated in a really laid back area. Staff are nice. I got the Goose and poached egg breakfast and it was by far the best thing I've had to eat here in the city. We were sitting with our plates in front of us for a while after we'd finished but all together a really good set up.
47,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Small coffee shop with nice environment. Coffee is good and the cheese cake and cinnamon bun are very nice...
48,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very delicious cappuccino and cinnamon bun in an relaxed and Scandinavian atmosphere.
The cinnamon bun is certainly one of the best ones I've tried so far. Even compared to those in Sweden or Denmark it's great."
49,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,a year ago,My happy place for good coffee and cinnamon rolls. Also good to read some stuff as it's not noisy. Good service.
50,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Definitely one of the top spots around town. I would recommend going elsewhere to buy your beans for home, though, as these are a bit pricier than expected."
51,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Cozy atmosphere, very friendly staff, and delicious coffee and desserts. Loved it!"
52,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Seating area is limited but there is a terrace, to avoid waiting book a table in advance. Nice atmosphere and staff and a delicious coffee."
53,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"These open sandwiches taste good and healthy, and the cinnamon bun is just 👌👌👌"
54,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome place. Coffee from Scandinavian roasters (this time from Tim Wendelboe and Drop Coffee) and fresh warm cinnamon buns. Nice service too, despite it being a very busy Sunday afternoon."
55,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great coffee. The Flat white and the cinnamon bun are my favorites. Downside: it is crowded. Avoid weekends
56,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great coffee with different options of beans and roasts. Food is good, and portions are small. Overall a great little place."
57,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great place for breakfast and brunch, amazing coffee. Very friendly staff."
58,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,a year ago,These are next level cinnamon buns especially when you get them when they've come straight out of the oven perfectly accompanied with a beautifully brewed coffee. Make sure you get there early though because these little beauts tender to …
59,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Always amazing service, and the best coffee in the city. I believe they work solely with beans that are in season, and you can definitely tell. They also have good lunch and snack options, and they sell coffeebeans and other related things …"
60,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very tasty breakfast and cool mood. Coffee is amazing. In front of the park
61,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice place for coffee.  the staff are very knowledgeable about coffee and happy to make suggestions.  Great place to buy coffee beans.
62,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Got the last cinnamon bun! So I'll give em 5 stars 😛
Oh, coffee -- probably the best I've tasted outside Italy (and maybe Australia!)"
63,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My colleague recommended us to have a cup of coffee there~ the decoration is simple and cozy, and I really like the latte art~~~😍😍its a swan 😍😍😍😍😍"

65,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really beautiful and cute little place.

The coffee is served in a fantastic way and tasted delicious. …"
66,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great specialty coffee. Fast friendly service
67,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Located at the end of saarphatipark (direction from Amstel River) this cosy, little Cafe is a perfect hidden gem on rainy and cold days. Quite busy all the time. Nice stuff, but they could smile a bit more. Amazing freshly baked scones, …"
68,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Response: thanks for the kind offer and I will definitely take you up for that next time I’m in the area! I’m sorry to hear you’re suffering from Covid and Suez situation. We’re living in strange times. But most importantly, the coffee was …"
69,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Coffee is as good as they say it is! Spacious seating area, friendly staff and decent food. A thumbs up for the coffee!
Attention: they dont accept cash."
70,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing Geisha coffee. Food was simple but very tasty. Nice staff.
71,Scandinavian Embassy, 2 stars ,10 months ago,"UPD: I've initially rated this place as 3 stars, but after the owner's reply, am rating it down. If you seriously find it reasonable  to do what you did, especially a day before the terraces officially open, on King's day and by the time …"
72,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice find!
The salmon with poached eggs were delicious. The staff is super friendly, and apparently a prize winning barista from Sweden working there but he's too modest …"
73,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best coffie in town, lots of new aromas and flavours to discover, just let the barista guide you. The cinnamon roll itself is worth calling there..."
74,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Its a cozy cofee place. As the avaliable space is limited its very posible you need to wait outside. For your orders to go. The menu include food and coffee. What i ordered was ethopian fruity but the acidity quite high, but the after taste is not astringent. Pricing is relative okey for amsterdam."
75,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Oh my god, their cinnamon roll is the best cinnamon roll I’ve ever had in my entire life!! Although I’ve been to many cafes and had many different cinnamon rolls before, I don’t think I’ll ever meet any better cinnamon roll elsewhere..."
76,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The cafe has a few tables outside. The batch brew and the cappuccino are average. The tea with pineapple is good, so is the cold brew. I found the pastries being overpriced for what it tastes. I have visited it a few times, would not …"
77,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It was so busy but the staff managed to keep their composure! Great Kenyan pourover and the cinnamon bun... well you just have to try it yourself.
78,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great speciality coffee from Drop Coffee Roasters. I tried v60 Ethiopia and Kenya, washed, perfectly brewed and served. Must visit!"
79,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place with super friendly staff. Tasty cappuccino - 4/5. Honestly, I expected much more about this place."
80,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nordic-themed cafe across from a park, with a sunlit nook at the back garden.
5* Coffee, perfect for snobs and newbie snobs
5* Ambiance, small tables and benches for socials, and big tables for working. …"
81,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Authentic kanelbullar - absolutely amazing! The coffee is excellent. Absolutely worth visiting when in Amsterdam.
82,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The best coffee in the Netherlands!
I recommend the pour-over coffee, the beans they use are incredible.
You can even pick up your own fresh beans in store and enjoy it at home.
The staff is incredible as well."
83,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Super cozy and friendly stuff.
84,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Coffee and cinnamon bun were delicious, but there were only 3 choices on breakfast menu, two of which were muesli. Good spot otherwise."
85,Scandinavian Embassy, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Even if you order take-away coffee you cannot use the toilet in this place. This is not a government rule. It is allowed everywhere in Amsterdam, but not here. I  mean, with those prices you expect a bit more than just coffee."
86,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely amazing. The portions are small, so make sure to buy more dishes and share. Don’t be afraid to share the table with others."
87,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Every time I come here, the staff are super rude and snooty. They're on their phones, not even paying attention. When I ask for sugar, they're like, ""oh we don't normally serve sugar with our coffees,"" like who cares what you normally do, I …"
88,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great specialty coffee. Got a nice intimate feel to it.
89,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Confortable and warm coffee! Great food and amazing personal.
90,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Coffee is an awesome take a batch brew highly recommended
91,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Love their coffee and cinnamon roll, fav!"
92,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good quality coffee and aparently famous for its cinamon ban which I didnt got to try but show the whole procedure of how they make it on the spot. A small but cosy place with minimal scandi aesthetic. On the down side: it can get quite busy and the service is a bit slow
93,Scandinavian Embassy, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Coffee was great but too bad that both staff members were acting pompous and unfriendly.
94,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favorite coffee place in Amsterdam! If you like flat white, you must try this one."
95,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"What can I say, it's not my cup of tea. My iced coffee came in a wine glass. It all just tasted too healthy."
96,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The best coffee I've in Amsterdam. Must to try the cinnamon roll as well.
97,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Very good coffee and great cinnamon rolls.
Very popular place and a little bit more expensive than avg coffe.
But definitely recommended."
98,Scandinavian Embassy, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Prices and queues are killing it. There are places with decent coffee nearby and without waiting
99,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The food and coffee was great and the staff was super friendly.
100,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came there mainly for the cinnamon buns and they didn’t disappoint! Light and airy with not too sweet filling evenly distributed throughout. They bake them in the house! Also had the recommended filtered coffee and a coffee blossom tea- …
101,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I loved this place. The espresso is excellent, their gravlax (salmon, poached egg, seasonal greens, bread) was a delicious and filling way to start a morning, and the staff was both extremely friendly and informative.  It has small counter …"
102,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Nice coffee and cheese cake. The device is great!
103,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Catering to the coffee aficionados since the best way to taste is black. Apart from the great presentation of coffee service, the standout is the fresh baked goods available to accompany your drink. The best is the sticky bun - if you get it fresh/hot, nothing better."
104,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Not many coffee options. The breakfast food, I think the one called salmon, was just meh."
105,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Love the atmosphere - excellent chilled coffee & warm service. Simple and brilliant.
106,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Nom nom nom! And not only their cinnamon buns are tasty 😋
107,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Place is small but have very good spirit into it!!! Well done ! Everything was served nice and clear!!!
108,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I personally think this is the best cafe in Amsterdam.
109,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It’s love at first sight🥰Great breakfast, amazing kanelbullar, good coffee, nice interior design. Be ready to wait for a table, and even if you’re there for a takeaway coffee—be ready to wait, too, especially on the weekends. All in all, I think it’s one of the best places for breakfast in Amsterdam, if not the best."
110,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best coffee ever. I love the espresso for it’s fantastic rich fruity flavour. This places is one of the biggest upsides of living in Amsterdam. Even when it’s busy they don’t compromise on quality. So the order might take a bit longer than your usual Starbucks chain.
111,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Ordered a batch brew to keep me warm while I sat in the park (it was a cloudy day).
The quality of the coffee lived upto expectations, but it was lukewarm. This …"
112,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A very chill place to hang for coffee aficionados. The art of simplicity.
113,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great coffee, relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff - the specialties are great, but a bit pricey"
114,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very nice coffee/rolls & friendly people. Don’t buy their beans for home use though. Double the price of other coffee places and ranks somewhere in the middle taste-wise.
115,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great coffee from great people. Pour over coffee is highly recommended w/ the tasty nordic  cinnamon buns! Cool to hang out, grab a quick coffee and you can ask all your questions about coffee they will have your back!"
116,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,3 months ago,The cinnamon buns are amazing. Must try!
117,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really cosy little place that feels hidden away from Amsterdam's hustle and bustle. Cinnamon buns are well worth the visit, but the coffee and hot chocolate are a bit ordinary. Staff were a little short with us, but this was understandable given they were so busy. Still, would recommend a visit just for the ambiance!"
118,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"People go for the coffee but I stay for the cinnamon rolls. I'm not a coffee drinker though some of my friends love it there. It can also be ordered to take away. The people working there is very nice and the food is delicious and very good taken care of. I love the cinnamon rolls, did I say it already?"
119,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Coffee is excellent! Its also worth going there for a lovely cinnamon roll ;)
During the weekends it can be very busy and you need to wait some time to get a seat. Also important, staff is very friendly!"
120,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great coffee, great atmosphere. Cozy interior"
121,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This was my favorite breakfast place when visiting Amsterdam. Very friendly staff, fantastic coffee and fresh food."
122,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Victim of their success — coffee is probably good but when I asked about advices for buying coffee beans, I did not get a real answer just : this one is good.
15€ for a bag. You can find more coffee expert places in Amsterdam and less crowded"
123,Scandinavian Embassy, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The coffee and ambience were pretty good, but the service was bizarre and slow. Took over an hour to get a filter coffee after the barista informed me I couldn’t get a long black because “they only serve filter coffee”. However, this …"
124,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Very nice coffee and pastries. Nice location in front of the park in De Pijp. Cool atmosphere.
125,Scandinavian Embassy, 1 star ,a year ago,"Pretentious, overpriced and not very good.Lukewarm, weak cappuccino with too much milk and too little foam. Took 15 minutes to arrive. The ordered slice of cake didn’t come at all, but was on the bill. …"
126,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place, good coffee, very nice service (although it's British more than Scandinavian judging by the way they speak, but I have no complains about it :)). It was my first time and frankly I expected the place to be bigger and have more on the menu, but it's a nice experience and I'm up to coming back."
127,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great coffee friendly staff.
128,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,a year ago,The whole place smells like coffee and cinammon. A dream!
129,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Service is typical Dutch. If you're expecting warmth, go south. But once they get to you, they make sure you have a great experience. The coffee is excellent. And the food...so delicious as they care about where it's procured, and how it's executed. Very rare for such a place this size and value."
130,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food here is so lovingly prepared.  I had the cod with potatoes.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned fish.  The ladies that run this shop take great pride in the coffee they prepare and the meals served.  The cake is fresh and soft.  It's not cheap, but I'm willing to pay for the flavor!"
131,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Didn’t sample the coffee but the raspberry soda was great and the pie was fantastic
132,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great staff, cool lady’s how has the place. A tad on the expensive side. Good quality food with true Scandinavian flavours, however hard to get Judy a normal coffee, very hipster 😂 nice interior design and atmosphere! Worth a visit!"
133,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super friendly service even amidst Sunday morning chaos. Ground our beans for us too! …
134,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"I've seen great reviews of this place and being Swedish, it had high expectations. Although staff were friendly and informative I found it shocking that they could only offer lighter roasted beans when I prefer dark roast. The flavor wasn't …"
135,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great coffee and friendly staff willing to take their time making suggestions and offering tastes. And really good kombucha! A+ presentation of food--loved sitting at the counter and getting to watch the chef at work. Lovely, calm, beautiful interior design; attention to detail everywhere."
136,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 months ago,One of the nicest coffee places in town!
137,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place lost it’s charm because of too many tourists! What upsets me that the cinnamon buns become smaller and smaller everytime I visit. The price do not become smaller too. The coffee is still great, but now I only take
It for take-away."
138,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cute coffee place, the food is great (could be a tiny bit bigger in portions). Cinnamon rolls are a must try. You can sit outside on a sunny day and sip your coffee watching passers by. Card only."
139,Scandinavian Embassy, 1 star ,a year ago,"My friend had abdominal surgery and they embarrassed him with an altercation over milk froth?
Smug attitude. Truly disgusting service. …"
140,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I only went for a tea and a little pastry, but my girlfriend has been several times and it lives up to the hype. …"
141,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Cool interior and descent service made the breakfast worth while. I have been told the coffee here is great but since I don't drink the stuff I was disappointed to find no tea options (no sparkling water on the menu either). My salmon with poached egg was delicious although kinda small for the price.
142,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Feel like you're in Sweden but you have to wait a loooong time to have your cinnamon roll (delicious )
143,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"A great cafe, with excellent coffee.
Caters to a young hipster crowd, and serves an outstanding pourover coffee, with multiple roast varieties on the menu. …"
144,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved this place. Cozy vibe, pretty busy at any given time. I had a delicious pour over coffee and freshly baked cinnamon bun. I had my coffee at the bar and watched them make the buns in front of me. The cafe is next to a nice small park called Sarphati where you can sit and watch locals walk their dogs."
145,Scandinavian Embassy, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Coffee's among the best in Amsterdam but service remains incredibly uppity. Interaction with staff has gotten so tedious that we've decided we'll stop coming here. We'll give business to a place with a bit less impressive coffee but a much better attitude, and there's many of those."
146,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Some of the best coffee in Amsterdam.

Please stop telling me to try your coffee before I add a sugar though. I get it, you think your blend is sweet. I KNOW. I’m here every week. Now let me put sugar in!"
147,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is my favourite coffee bar in the world. Their coffee is the best I have tasted so far and the staff is friendly and caring. They have table service and will help you choose from the menu or give you recommendations when asked. What I …
148,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A beautiful stylish little coffee shop. Calm and relaxed atmosphere, with lovely friendly staff.
The blueberry and almond cake was an absolute dream, and a must if they have it in! Worth every penny and a real treat."
149,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I’m a pesky tourist (thanks for the call out previous reviewers!)who found out about this place because I met an employee at a concert. I was so excited to find a place serving seasonal Scandinavian food. The food and the coffee were top …

Passionate barista’s. Very nice selection of roasts. They usually have some Drop Coffee on the self to purchase. …"
151,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"One of the best cafes I've been too.  wonderful Scandinavian aesthetic with super good coffee. Had a couple of flat whites.  Didn't eat there, but the poached eggs looked amazing.  Will be back."
152,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really cool place. The decor is very nice. I had muesli with yoghurt & a latte, which was very tasty and a great start to my day. I've only given it 4 stars because the service was slow. I got there way before some of the others and they were still served before me, even though the woman had acknowledged me."
153,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great Coffee. GREAT Coffee. It's a bit crowded on the weekend and service can be a bit slow, but it's still worth it. Just across from a small park.
There are very few seats, some along a communal table, so it's also a great place to meet other people."
154,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent coffee and a brilliant location. Right in the hipster part of town and across from a nice Park. Highly recommended and I suggest a walk in the park following coffee or with your coffee. …
155,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great coffee. Nice friendly interested staff. Simple well cooked food. Just wish it was easier to get a table on Sunday.
156,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,High quality coffee and even better food. The Danish bread soup with yogurt was interesting and unusual for us; it's something we vowed to try making ourselves at home. The espresso is as good as any I've had in the northwestern US.
157,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The best coffee in town
but the service is slow"
158,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent coffee, but there are even worse news... They bake absolutely delicious cinnamon rolls. If you are walking by and smell the little buns, get them while they're hot!"
159,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My best coffee place in Amsterdam! Great atmosphere, excellent coffee and delicious cinnamon buns! The place is often busy and has limited sitting place, which means you might have to wait for a seat or grab a quick to-go. Either way, I think it's worth it!"
160,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is hands down the best cappuccino in Amsterdam. Very chill, small and cozy cafe, they roast their own and it's usually crowded. If you're serious about coffee this is a place you MUST visit!"
161,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"A cozy place in a nice location.  The Swedish staff are friendly and passionate about coffee, but were rather opinionated, asking me if I was sure I wanted sugar in my cappuccino. The lack of comfortable chairs doesn't make it the most ideal spot for reading etc."
162,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best coffee in all of Amsterdam. Don’t go anywhere else. Well you could but it won’t be the same!
163,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is good to work on your computer. They offer coffee from different parts of the world (Ethiopia, Kenya, Bolivia and blend from Kenya and Guatemala). I had a natural geisha that unfortunately did not meet my expectations in terms of getting the best out of the coffee in the preparation process."
164,Scandinavian Embassy, 1 star ,a year ago,"Very long line in COVID times, all over the sidewalk. And when you arrive at the desk, they don’t serve Americano...? They do have espresso and hot water but refuse to combine it. Very arrogant and unfriendly."
165,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Incredible coffee and a relaxed vibe! Had the mushrooms, which were great. Would've liked to see a few more things on the menu and some GF bread though! Otherwise very very nice."
166,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely place, super friendly baristas and a great coffee and atmosphere."

171,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"OK but that's all.  The coffee (in shallow cups) and the (tiny) cinnamon rolls are worth trying here for their flavour.  But it's a pretentious, cramped little place, basically for airBnB tourists and loud expat yuppies with children, and …"
172,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Coffee is great (deserves 5 stars), the cafe s wooden interior makes for a nice Scandinavian atmosphere. 4 stars because sugar is not available by default (you have to ask for it) and I d expect a cafe of this caliber (they know their coffee!) to have at least two types of beans to select from."

174,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best coffee in Amsterdam! Love it. Stuff is cute and helpful.
175,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place for brunch. Quite pricey, so I don't go there that often. Their cinnamon rolls are pretty good, their taste binds very well with warm coffee. Right across the park. Friendly staff."
176,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great coffee and buns. The space can get crowded and extremely loud when it rains! Most of the service is super lovely. The dishes tend to be a little overpriced. Still a favourite though!
177,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"First of all, these people take their establishment's name seriously as well as the coffee they serve.
By far the best coffee I've got in Amsterdam. …"

180,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It’s love at first sight🥰Great breakfast, amazing kanelbullar, good coffee, nice interior design. Be ready to wait for a table, and even if you’re there for a takeaway coffee—be ready to wait, too, especially on the weekends. All in all, I think it’s one of the best places for breakfast in Amsterdam, if not the best."
181,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great coffee from great people. Pour over coffee is highly recommended w/ the tasty nordic  cinnamon buns! Cool to hang out, grab a quick coffee and you can ask all your questions about coffee they will have your back!"

187,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food here is so lovingly prepared.  I had the cod with potatoes.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned fish.  The ladies that run this shop take great pride in the coffee they prepare and the meals served.  The cake is fresh and soft.  It's not cheap, but I'm willing to pay for the flavor!"
188,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best coffee ever. I love the espresso for it’s fantastic rich fruity flavour. This places is one of the biggest upsides of living in Amsterdam. Even when it’s busy they don’t compromise on quality. So the order might take a bit longer than your usual Starbucks chain.
189,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great coffee!!
190,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"You have to come for a coffee here! It is such a nice place. The coffee is amazing, and the food is delicious. All is prepared carefully, and the staff is so nice. Simply great!"

192,Scandinavian Embassy, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Flat White, Cappuccino, and coffee drinks were nicely done and tasted well.
But the service basically non-existant, we asked to order at the bar and were told that someone would come to our table. More than 20 minutes passed until we …"
193,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"They enforce a no laptop policy on weekends. This was not made very visible to the customer on the website, and disappointed me as I was looking for a place to work. Cappuccino was of reasonable quality. Mushroom soup was fine as well."
194,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best coffee places in Amsterdam. They also offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. There's a cozy sitting area with a garden with at the back of the cafe. It could take some time the get the coffee on the weekend as it become busy."
195,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cool vibe and decent coffee. Didn't try the food, but it looked like there was care and effort put into the selection. Will have to try eating here next time. Nice park nearby for a walk."
196,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"It was a highlight of my trip to Amsterdam - although it's obviously Sweden inspired, you can tell by the interiors and even their food. I had a traditional cinnamon bun (Kanelbullar) and AMAZING coffee. …"

198,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My cured salmon, poached eggs and greens on danish rye was delicious. They don't mention in the description that they douse it in white pepper and layer it with some delicious white sauce. Coffee was only a 4/5 though, if I'm being picky."
199,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is fantastic and well organized, even if it is always pretty busy. You can eat fresh food or just take a tea/coffee. Keep always in mind the fundamental rule: no laptop in week-end! :)"

205,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"They take coffee and themselves comically seriously but the coffee is good especially the pourover.
Bring your own sugar if you want some, they do not agree with sweetened coffee. …"
206,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best coffee you can taste in Amsterdam. Cozy atmosphere with wooden decoration. Difficult to find spot during busy times, due to small space. Worths waiting though"

209,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"One of our favourite Amsterdam interiors. The people here make the place, as does the coffee bar & kitchen counter combo. Take your server's recommendation on a pourover or the day's espresso, plus house-cured honey salmon with the gooiest poached eggs."
210,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,6 months ago,One of the best coffees in town!
211,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"This place is truly special. From the delicate effort put into their food, to the knowledgable and attentive baristas, to the decor and atmosphere - one of the best breakfast experiences I've had for a long time. Coffee is sourced from some …"
212,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The oat latte was amazing and the cinnamon bun delicious! Great service, very lovely and kind staff. It's a cute place! Definitely will come back!"
213,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The baristas here make some of the best espresso drinks I've found in Amsterdam! Also the cinnamon/cardamom rolls are amazing! Be prepared for LONG waits on weekends though.
214,Scandinavian Embassy, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Good coffee! However, not sure about how trained the staff is when it comes to hygiene. Don't charge guest cell phones on the shelve leaning on the plates you serve food on! That 's outright nasty."
215,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great coffee, but do’t go there when you’re in a rush. Coffee seems like art to them, it cab take up to 10 minutes when you order a take-away."
216,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Their coffee is great. However, I had to wait for half an hour for cappuccino/latte multiple times. Too long for a cup of coffee"

224,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"If you happen to be in Sarphati Park and want to have a good drink, whether a tea or cappuccino, you should definitely stop by this place, just opposite to the park. I normally have oat cappuccino and it tastes quite good! There is also internet and a small garden in the back so you can work / relax."
225,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Great Coffee at tiny place -  be aware! Scandinavian prices, really too expensive, even for Amsterdam"
226,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice coffee, friendly staff, felt very welcome. Food is mediocre - prepared by an amateur in a homemade style. Service is very slow and prices are on par with this being a trendy hipster artisan coffee place - expensive."

229,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Hands down the best coffee in Amsterdam
230,Scandinavian Embassy, 2 stars ,4 years ago,I'm changing my initial review; last time I was waiting for someone to take my order for about 20 min. In the meantime other customers came in and sat next to me; they were served right away and no one noticed I'm still waiting. Eventually I left to have coffee elsewhere.

233,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Seriously good high quality coffee. Food looked nice but I had breakfast porridge and was great. Minimalistic modern atmosphere and overlooking the park in a trendy area of Amsterdam.
234,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice flat white and cafe latte
235,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Very pretentious place, rather small and very very pricey for the limited choice they have. The poached egg was ok but the poached cod was very average. Coffee looked nice though. There are loads of better options in De Pijp."
236,Scandinavian Embassy, 1 star ,2 years ago,Ordered a cappuccino and waited over an hour. Asked two different people where my drink was. Everyone was friendly but apparently they didn’t want to serve me.
237,Scandinavian Embassy, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Smug overpriced and pretentious place. to avoid, there are other quality places that are more reasonably priced. Their staff has an atttide problem which pops up unexpectedly."

239,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The coffee here is the best you'll find, and the food is made from good quality produce, but the dishes aren't particularly scandinavian. More like scandinavian-inspired dutch. But that doesn't change how well it tasted. …"

242,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Flat white and cinnamon bun 💓

250,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great baristas who are friendly and talkative. The coffee usually from Danish or Swedish producers.  Get the cinnamon roll with your coffee, it's the best combo!"
251,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"As others have said this is the best coffee in Amsterdam. I've been to most, if not all, of the other specialty coffee places. There are many good ones out there (another great is KOKO and espresso fabriek) but none as good as Swedish …"

254,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Coffee in Amsterdam (arguably anywhere) does not get better than at Scandinavian Embassy. The equilibrium of fantastic caffeinated beverages paired with progressive Scandinavian dishes provide a temporary feeling of bliss outside the city's hustle and bustle.
255,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice patio in the back! Free WiFi. Great location near the park. Lovely friendly staff. Tasty cinnamon buns that are not too sweet

262,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good coffee and one of the best cinnabon rolls but the service is very slow and be lucky to have one of those rolls as they don't bake a lot of them.
263,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Healthy food and friendly staff. In front of Sarphatipark in De Pijp.
264,Scandinavian Embassy, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I had the worst gasha coffee here, although it is said the barista had won the champion of some Nordic coffee competition, but the brewing was really bad to get the best flavor of the coffee bean deserved."

267,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice. Coffee a slightly burnt, food nice but small portions. A crying baby and a person loudly taking a work call next to me - that sort of place"
268,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Hands down the best oatmilk cappuccino in Amsterdam. Think the food is a bit overpriced (especially the poached eggs with salmon), but the staff are always very polite."

274,Scandinavian Embassy, 1 star ,2 years ago,Lousy breakfast menu. Cinnamon buns no longer seem to be available. Slow service. Weak and Luke warm flat white.
275,Scandinavian Embassy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"If you like to drink the best coffee in town, this is the place to be.  Go for the Peruvian filter coffee. Why would you drink cappuccino if you can drink this.  This place can be busy."
276,Scandinavian Embassy, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The salmon Benedict is very unique, salted salmon tasted great with the poached eggs and yogurt, I would come for the dish but not for the drip coffee."

287,Scandinavian Embassy, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"cute little place with friendly service and simplicity. Food is delicious. Downside was slow service, more DIY than hip/minimalistic design and very small portions. Prices are on the higher end."
