0,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Interesting Mexican food joint. The nachos and guac were ok, have had better tasting guac in Mexico. The rice and beans spring veggies was good. Everything served was a bit cold including the rice which is not usually the norm in Mexico. The Staff is very friendly and it was quick service. Overall a good experience."
1,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,a month ago,"Was super excited but these were by far the worst tacos I‚Äôve had in a few years time. All places I‚Äôve tried in amsterdam (tried a lot) are much better quality food. No taste, loads of mayonaise, just disgusting. Thrown it away. Will never ever come here again."
2,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,7 months ago,They have the best nachos and tacos I've ever had. Different than original Mexican food.  I would recommend trying the Crunchy chicken tacos. Sooo good!!!
3,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The food and cocktails were delicious and considerably cheap! We had a lovely waitress that made sure we were satisfied. Good vibe, good music. Will definitely be back soon"
4,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Extremely good food! I would recommend the queso quesadillas. Will definitely go there again!
5,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,a month ago,"I‚Äôm Mexican I did know this is not authentically Mexican food, but still it was not tasty at all. The pastor burrito doesn‚Äôt have a taste of pastor. And the beef tacos were okay."
6,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Friendly staff and fresh burritos.
I was recommended the crunchy chicken burrito and it was one of the tastiest burrito I had in a while. The burrito was filled with fresh ingredients and unique ‚Ä¶"
7,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We ordered Al Pastor(pork-based) and Sweet Spring (sweet potato-based) and both were delicious! Each serving consists of two tacos so you can mix and match as you like. We also had nachos and guacamole as a starter and three coronas in ‚Ä¶
8,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Worst taco's ever! Truly. These are the wraps you get in the supermarket, nothing like real taco's. We paid ‚Ç¨4,50 for Guacamole on one of the taco's which was only about a teaspoon's worth. We threw 3/4 out it was so bad. Please avoid"
9,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,4 months ago,Bad service. Waited over 40 min to get served by rude staff and got cold nanchos. On top of that got attitude from staff. Btw they don‚Äôt give you side plates and assume asking for them is a serious offence. ‚Ä¶
10,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty good tacos, we got the special with pulled pork and it was delicious, the pastor was very good too though the meat was a little thick, but the flavours were there. They are not traditional Mexican rather mexican inspired but this is ‚Ä¶"
11,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Service was quick and helpful. All vegetarian tacos were super tasty and portion size was very big. Like how cozy it is... for that prize and in this location it's fab.
12,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Taco‚Äôs are great and service is good, just DO NOT order through Thuisbezorgd since they send their delivery guys too late, cause the order to reach the resto late, which then causes a 30-60min delay on the delivery time. ‚Ä¶"
13,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Street food kind of atmosphere. Really good tacos, recommend them for spending at least your lunch. Kind service as well. Thumbs up."
14,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Great service, good drinks and good food. There's only one vegan option and it's not the best. It puzzles me that it costs the same to the meat options (which look fantastic, and my friends confirmed that they are), but it has no special ‚Ä¶"
15,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Usually very tasty tacos but have been outside waiting in the cold for an order that was supposed to take 10 mins for over 30 mins while all the delivery services picked up their orders in the meantime. When we asked again, we got a rude response from the staff that we were told to wait outside."
16,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We reserved the table for 4 people, we order beef burito, chicken rice and beans, and two times burito with mushrooms. Everybody was realy happy about their choise . Everything was tasty and fresh, the portion was big. We took food for take away. We recomended this place . Enjoy"
17,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great Mexican place. Chips, salsa, guacamole, burritos, tacos , margherita, and corona were all excellent. Also great decor and super firefly service."
18,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was nice and fresh. Perhaps the environment and styling is beautiful in the evening. But the plans are really sad looking and top tip for management: ‚Ä¶
19,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Had a burrito and a taco and both were very delicious. Very nice selection of hot sauces available for those looking to spice it up further!
20,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,4 months ago,very very delicious but a bit overpriced
21,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I like the guacamole, the nachos are from a package, 3 customers, I was only one, it takes a decent time to serve, for sure if I was on date the time would go a lot quickerüòò se olvidaron de mi comidaüòÅ  pero me gusta la comida"
22,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Easy to find at Van Woustraat, almost opposite to the entry to Albert Cuyp. Tacos, burritos, whatever you can think off, for carnivores but also vegetarian friendly. Price per taco on average 7-8 euros, flush it down with corona and in truly nice, welcoming atmosphere. Not possible to reserve, but you will be able to find a spot."
23,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Only an option with a reservation. Found the restaurant totally empty but 1 table and was quickly thrown away! Couldn't even order take away the server was so quick to say no. What a shame, used go be very nice."
24,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Had the bahia and  tacos. Both were phenomenal. Decor is down-to-earth and unpretentious. Staff are really helpful and chill. Will definitely come here again next time I'm in Amsterdam. Go here!!!
25,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Taco Cartel has great food! I had the nachos, there where flavorful. Then I had two kinds of tacos the Sloppy joe and the El pastor wich where both delicious. They have a big menu I was suprised by this, and i can't wait to try more things ‚Ä¶"
26,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy taco place with great music and a cool atmosphere. The Amsterdam version of Mexican street food, a bit more expensive and not as spicy but there's a variety of hot sauces available and plenty of lime. Drinks are average price for ‚Ä¶"
27,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best tacos I have ever tasted. I tried multiple restaurants in Amsterdam but couldn‚Äôt find anything better than them. The service is super quick and the staff is very friendly. ‚Ä¶

You definitely should go there if you wanna eat mexican in Amsterdam."
30,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favorite burrito & taco place in Amsterdam. Wide range of options, very friendly staff, and cosy atmosphere. Definitely recommended!"
31,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Was a bit disappointed, meat was dry and chewy. Cocktails (margarita) were very small, just add up ice I would say even just to create the impression you get a full drink. Place looks great though and staff was extremely friendly."
32,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Superb! Super tasty Mexican food. Not too expensive (maybe the desserts). Small place in De Pijp, we were lucky to get a table. If you have time just make a reservation. Surely a place to come back. The employees were nice and helpful. Happy we walked by just by chance."
33,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,6 months ago,like so many other places they are a bit understaffed but the  unpretentious american mexican food is quite ok. good atmosphere.
34,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Loved everything and I have had some authentic Mexican food living in San Antonio... this is just good food plain and simple.
35,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Disappointed by the tacos el pastor, the meat was dry beyond belief. So dry we ended up throwing it out. The crunchy chicken taco was good but not great, and honestly I expected corn tortillas for this and getting the plain white flour ‚Ä¶"
36,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I was a hungry traveller roaming around De Pijp and I found this place. The guy who served me and the other girl behind the counter were definitely English and the menu is in English which leads me to believe the owners are English. BUT ‚Ä¶
37,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We went for cocktails but they had no ice so opted for beer. The food was super delicious and very reasonable priced. Did not leave hungry.
38,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"food is amazing, nice flavours and good price. the service was a little bit slow."
39,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,10 months ago,"Disappointed by the tacos el pastor, the meat was dry. The crunchy chicken taco was good but not great, and cold. They use plain white flour tacos, out of the supermarket. 6 euro for a cruncy chicken bag with 5 very small pieces of cold chicken, a robbery!!"
40,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Burritoes were very good. Service was nice and friendly too.
41,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"yummy tacos, good atmosphere and nice staff. There are several great vegan options and also alcohol free beer :-)"
42,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely delicious Nachos and well filled buritto's. Also give the cocktails a try! They are 5 euro's on Thursday's!
43,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice decor and great service. Food is OK, but not authentic at all."
44,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The food was so tasty. The atmosphere and the staff were amazing
45,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best taco place in town. Good price quality value and authentic. Try the prescaditos!!! They‚Äôre beter than bitterballen üòä
46,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Closest thing to authentic Mexican I've had in Amsterdam. A bit pricey, but tasty. Friendly staff"
47,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We went on a Monday around 19:00. Place was not crowded but people were coming and going. Service is good and friendly. We order the special nachos for stater with a Paloma and a Margarita. Definitely good start. After, we had beef and ‚Ä¶"
48,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,a year ago,"We were here on a Sunday , had the vegan burrito, the description sounded very nice, but the experience... Our biggest disappointment ever ever ever...
How can you mess up a burrito??? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yeah, maybe the other thing in the menu are nice but I won't be back to check those ."
49,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely concept, delicious food, great value for money and super creative ambiance"
50,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place, very cool staff. I'm usually a meat eater but the eggplant taco was our #1!"
51,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 3 stars ,a year ago,Eating at the restaurant was great a few months ago but our order on Ubereats was a total disappointment. The extra cheese came on the side (for a burrito it‚Äôs not ideal) and was cheap pizza mozzarella stuff. The vegan burrito had no ‚Ä¶
52,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Not your average taco. Breakfast burrito highly recommendable, maybe not for breakfast though:D"
53,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice food and very fast service. Okk goedkoop
54,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Excellent authentic Mexican food with a slight European twist.  The portions are large and fulfilling.
55,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice place and service, but tacos had no taste :("
56,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,a year ago,"Let me start off by saying something nice: our order was taken down accurately and professionally. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted friendly and the order was prepared quickly despite that we were much too early to pick it up. ‚Ä¶"
57,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Reservations recommended. Food and service were fine, vegan options available. My friends really enjoyed their meals. I ardently hate cilantro/coriander, my dish had coriander in it but it was not listed on the menu. If you hate cilantro make sure to ask the staff what dishes contain it!!!!!"
58,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I don't know too much about tacos but I was brought there by two friends who are aficionados and it was really good. Place is not too big so when we came on a Friday night around 8 pm we were told to come in 1/2 h and they actually called ‚Ä¶
59,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Just overall not satisfying Mexican food in the slightest. Bland and bad texture. Place was empty no doubt. I seriously do not know what the good reviews are about. Had the mushroom burrito and the eggplant burrito to share and couldn‚Äôt finish either of them. Save your money there‚Äôs plenty of better options up the street.
60,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I've a had a very pleasant experience with Taco Cartel. We ordered Chicken and Beef Burritos which were opulent, fresh and richly filled with savory meats. They came with really nice homemade Guac and Salsa. The restaurant had forgotten the ‚Ä¶"
61,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food! The tortilla chips and Guacamole are amazing. I also enjoyed the battered fish tacos. They were spicy and the mango sauce was just the right touch. Crunchy chicken lives up to it's crunchy name. Portion sizes are just right. We couldn't finish the burrito we were so full.
62,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We went to Taco Cartel because the restaurant looked nice from the outside and had a lovely evening. We tried soft tacos with chicken and vegetarian burritos as well as nachos with guacamole and everything tasted DELICIOUS. The staff was ‚Ä¶

64,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,11 months ago,"I ordered taco's on uber eats, my tacos were completely cold...
I was really disappointed about this.
also the Vegan Meggplant taco was super faint, not flavoury at all..."
65,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I stumbled upon this place on Google Maps and since I'm always on the hunt for for tacos, I decided I must try it out. We had the beef tacos and the mushroom cheese tacos and they were both quite good, though we we both enjoyed the mushroom ‚Ä¶"
66,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome food, staff and music. The crunchy chicken taco is second to none! Like an angel peeing on your tongue. Veggie taco's also killer. Different flavor combinations than you're used to! I keep coming back to this place! Cheers"
67,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tacos were excellent. Stopped by here last March and came again for a second round when I was in town in June. I'm US expat living in Brussels, which has taught me that getting good, quality, tasty Mexican/tacos is difficult to come by in ‚Ä¶"
68,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,a year ago,"Burrito Meggplant? More like burrito mehh-plant.
Probably the most disappointing excuse for a burrito I‚Äôve had in my life. ‚Ä¶"
69,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing tacos, good margaritas, cold coronas. The fish tacos (skiffabay) are some of the best I've had in my life, definitely best in Europe. Cod is buttery and delicious, lightly breaded melts in your mouth and is complemented so well by ‚Ä¶"
70,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was excellent, I'm a fanatic for fish tacos and this place hit the spot. We went for an afternoon lunch and no one was really there, but the gentlemen working was very fast and pleasant while serving us. Cute decor inside, around $9 for 2 good sized tacos, I'd definitely order 3 next time."
71,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Went to Taco Cartel around 3 PM on a Sunday afternoon, didn't get our order taken until around 3:20PM, didn't have water brought to us to until around 3:30PM, when we received our chip and guac appetizer the chips were very stale (which, to ‚Ä¶"
72,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Very bad service and awful tacos, if you like tacos don‚Äôt get it here."
73,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is very tasty. I got tacos al pastor, beef quesadilla and a margarita. All of them delicious üòã The staff is friendly and very efficent. Prices aren't bad at all. You can have Mexican bottle beer, Jupiter and Leffe draught, paloma, G&T and some others cocktails. Good tequila too."
74,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Quite disappointing on a personal level. My order was forgotten. Waited for ca 40min. When asking the waiter, the first answer was that it is just busy. Just then realizing that the order was not even in the system because it was forgotten. ‚Ä¶"
75,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Customer service is great! The food is good but definitely this is definitely not Mexican food at all. Rice doesn't have ant enchilada sauce mixed in, there's no Mexican spices in the veggies and pico de gallo is bland. Chicken was good but ‚Ä¶"
76,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great, burritos are delicious, perfect place to eat Mexican food"
77,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great fish taco's! It tasted all very good and fresh thanks to the guacemole and tomato. Just a bit weird you get your nacho's served in a stapled paper bag. We also didn't get forks or knives. I get the point, but it doesn't make the experience better. Dessert was great too, even though it came in a plastic cup!"
78,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Gave 10 euro for a 3-bite sized taco. Give a hungry skinny guy a bit more please. As tasty as the taco was, the pricing is completely unjustified. On the other side - Interior is neat and staff is friendly. Props for the decorations."
79,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,3 years ago,I would not revisit. We ordered the nachos with cheese and only one burrito. We planned to order another burrito but the other dishes were just not good enough and we lost appetite. The nacho dish was very small for 10euro and had bottled ‚Ä¶
80,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very friendly staff!! The food is good quality too (better than Salsa Shop for example) and less tex mex influence which you can see in the toppings. Recently they increased the prices which is the shame :(
81,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing mexican food! Definitely recommended.
I'm a huge fan of mexican and I've tried many places, but this one was the best I've ever had. ‚Ä¶"
82,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great tacos, always have a delicious meal. Staff is pleasent as well. üëç"
83,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great taco. Staff is always nice :)
84,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"These are tourist taco‚Äôs, flour tortillas (not corn) should tell you everything. Loads of mayo and you only get 2.......for ‚Ç¨11. Tastes nothing like Mexican tacos, sorry but not great. ‚Ä¶"
85,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is tasty. Restaurant is a bit small and the servers pass you quite close. Would rather see them serve the food on plates. At the moment they serve is directly on a tray, just with a piece of paper underneath it. Makes it quite messy. Also ordered two caipirihias which were low on cacacha."
86,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Ordered thuisbezorgd with two other co-workers. Flavours were as they should be, but we felt the price was much too high for the portion size. Burritos at Salsashop are almost twice the size, and 1-2 euros cheaper. So, all in all OK, but ‚Ä¶"
87,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The place looks nice but i was not impressed by the food. Had guac with nachos and chicken tacos. Guac was ok. 10 euros for 2 tacos is a bit steep but fine. The tacos were not great, two cold (!) flour tacos with kind of bland chicken and a weird mix of sauces and vegetables. Could do better!"
88,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Literally the best tacos in Ottawa!! no joke this place is the real deal. ALWAYS fresh and the steak tacos are out of this world. Very reasonably priced as well for the size of the food you are getting.
89,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"cool space. benches are not the most convenient seats though. Generally I like open kitchen but this one I'd rather not see. As for foods, you may call me a food snob but fish didn't have any flavor, tacos are based on wheat flour, nachos tasted ok but not great. Would I recommend this place to anyone else? No."
90,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,I ordered the crunchy chicken taco. The taste is very good. But the portion of the dish is not that much. Maybe britto is a better choice. I think I will try britto next time. Also the seat and table make me feel little bit cheap.
91,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,a year ago,I had the vegan burrito which is 3 pieces of deefried eggplant with some lettuce. The eggplant was still hard and the taste wasn't good. ‚Ä¶
92,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is a must go if you enjoy Mexican and spicy texmex food. The food is full of flavor and the way they mix them is a joy for the palate. I will definitely come back for another fish taco.
93,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Will have to try the whole menu, pastor and baja fish taco definitely up to the standard. Easy to share as a snack, nice hot salsas provided. Order inside at the bar (there is only 1 small table outside)"
94,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,best burrito and tacos i‚Äòve ever eaten. location is a bit old but charmimg. üîù
95,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We were first skeptical when we saw there were no customers inside, but decided to go after all and the place turned out to be a very pleasant surprise! The food was excellent as well as the staff. Cheesy shrooms tacos are strongly recommended! The only drawback - interior design."

97,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, good service, maybe a bit expensive but overall great!"
98,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,a month ago,Really great tocos and Burrito!!!
99,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was pretty good and the service superb. Especially since the girl serving us was virtually alone. She was bartender cook and server. Quite impressive, will come back!"
100,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Moral responsibility led me to write this. As a Mexican foodie living in Amsterdam I can confirm this - this restaurant is NOT Mexican. It may look like it (read again: May look ), their menu is far from it, and the taste and presentation ‚Ä¶"
101,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is good, me encanta any Mexican (tex-mex) cuisine. Kind of a shame though it's more a take-away place than a proper place to dine. While I sat there, I saw at least 8 different delivery cyclist come in. Which does something to the atmosphere."
102,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This place has delivered to me the nastiest food I‚Äôve ever (tried to) have.
I‚Äôm so disgusted !! Couldn‚Äôt eat it. A cold burrito with watery rice and no sauce! ‚Ä¶"
103,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been here several times now as their tacos are really good, innovative and full of flavour. Expect a slightly hipster but cozy interior, good for a laid back date night or hangout with friends"
104,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good looking place with super friendly staff! But I didn't like the food... Cold and really bad presented... No plates, just a paper bag (for nachos) and a plastic tray with the burritos on it. For me, taste and food presentation are not good as the enviroment is."
105,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"good music, tasty food, nice service. lime mayonnaise is amazing!"
106,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, with a range of small bites. Plate of taco-chips was killer! very friendly staff too. Nothing extremely authentic, but beats taco-bell by a long shot!"
107,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a great place: awesome decor, awesome music and awesome food!"
108,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food! Ordered a crunchy chicken burrito and it came within 20 minutes. Fresh and tasty food along with good service, so will definitely order here more often."
109,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best Mexican I've had in the city.
110,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was absolutely divine, with a tastefully modest variety of options to boot! Delightful atmosphere and decoration. Service wasn't timely but once business got busy it stepped up a mile. Definitely worth visiting before it gets too busy!"
111,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Super fresh taco's, love the al pastor and the crunchy chicken!! Also great atmosphere and friendly staff. Perfect if you want a quick healthy bite and very affordable."
112,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Easily the best Mexican place in Amsterdam. Great hot sauces that are hard to find anyplace else. Friendly crew and cozy interior, right by the Albert Cuypmarkt."
113,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I ordered with UberEATS, it came pretty fast, packaging was good and the portion size as well. Unfortunately the burrito and the guacamole did not have any seasoning, both were completely tasteless"
114,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really enjoyed the lime chicken taco which was lovely and refreshing. The crunchy chicken burrito is also good - I'd have preferred a little less rice but super tasty nonethelessüëå
115,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"5 stars for the amazing service. Steve is awesome! He's instantly welcoming and friendly, offers great menu advice and even offered neighborhood tips. A very pleasant experience overall and I'll definitely be back."

117,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Simple but very good food. Very friendly staff. Homely atmosphere. 5/7 would recommend. Could mix it up on the hot sauces though.

119,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"absolutely incredible food. soft taco heaven. whatever the big wigs say, this place is a must. Sunday half price tacos was a complete brilliant bonus! üíØ"
120,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic Tacos, for a good price. We had beef, crispy chicken and another one which I forgot the name of, but they where all greatly presented with a near perfect palate."
121,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really liked the vegetarian burrito.
Plus one star for the packaging (most of take away packaging is from paper.) as you are being environmentally conscious.Thumbs up!"
122,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Its in my neighborhood and I have to say all things are fresh, delicious and authentic!  Very satisfied!"
123,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Hipster Mexican food, as someone who lived in the US and misses proper Texmex this is finally a super tasty option in Amsterdam ! I love the skiffa bay fish tacos (8.95 for 2 tacos)"
124,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 1 star ,a year ago,"Ordered ‚Ç¨12 tacos. Then afterwards they charged ‚Ç¨2,50 for sauce. Scam artists."
125,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Ordered
Was not that good - meat very fatty etc"
126,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent tacos.  Go for the platter so you can try a bit of everything.  Was really surprised by the aubergine and the mushroom tacos, unique and really lekker."

130,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very decent tacos and burritos! The vegetarian options were great
131,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Having tried most of the Mexican places around town, these guys are probably one of the best. Well thought through menu. Good flavours. Recommended"
132,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,very good food... excellent service
133,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 4 stars ,a year ago,Food was really good but didn't like the interiors much. Still confused if the interiors were not well maintained or if that was by design
134,Chiapas Taco Cartel, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Mediocre food. Not bad perse but there was hardly any chicken in the chicken burrito that I had and the tortillas were cold and a bit tasteless.
