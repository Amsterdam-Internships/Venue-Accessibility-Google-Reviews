1,Billy's Thai Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"This place was so good I came back three times while in Amsterdam. The Red Curry with pineapple was my favorite although everything I had there was top notch.
Also excellent, friendly service!"
2,Billy's Thai Restaurant, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The red curry was not bad at all. But at first I thought they sent me a vegetarian order by mistake. It's only after a long search that I found ""the"" small piece of chicken that makes it, technically, a chicken curry (see attached picture). …"

6,Billy's Thai Restaurant, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good service, the staff is polite and the food is good. The price ranges up to €18 or so per dish, a curry would be €15 or so which I find a bit on the pricey side for a Thai restaurant but they have a great location so it's understandable. There is wifi available and a great range of dishes. I would like to come here again."
