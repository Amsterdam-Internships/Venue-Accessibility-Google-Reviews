0,Biblos Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"They really go an extra mile during the Halloween on deco and ambiance. Drinks fairly priced and friendly staff. Clean.
No a place to ""sit""."
1,Biblos Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Small bar with a lot of character. Played a lot of hit songs from America, I'm sure the karaoke night they host on Monday nights would be a great time with some friends! Just came here for drinks, bartenders had a lot of humorous personalities"
2,Biblos Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really cool place to visit. The bartenders are very friendly and nice. Good choice of music, it was not too crowd for that moment, but still nice .Highly  Recomending!"

5,Biblos Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,For me it was the best bar experience in Amsterdam. The bar closes 3am (2hour after all bars in red district are closed) and you are served by the most friendly bar staff I could meet in Amsterdam. I love it and I recommend it 100%!!!
