0,Restaurant Stedelijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want the most aloof wait staff in the city, this is your restaurant. Seriously, they couldn't care less if and when you order and that takes a lot of skill to master. Upon arriving, I asked the waiter if we should wait or seat …"

3,Restaurant Stedelijk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Slowish service but good food and good views.
4,Restaurant Stedelijk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Food was not so good. Don't get fooled by looks or picture of the photos on google. The restaurant has a nice and modern look but it is a tourists trap. People enters by the look of the restaurant. The restaurant don't care about food as …
5,Restaurant Stedelijk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"A casual restaurant suits for families. On the menu you'll find small and big sizes of arrangements as well as the prices, which is good for someone eating small portion like me. Although it's a casual restaurant, they know how to serve it …"
6,Restaurant Stedelijk, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"First it took for ever for waiter to bring menus,when I asked if we should just get our own he airily answered No (there was apparently no hurry for the customers to decide what they would like). Food was not bad. When I went to ladies room …"
7,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,Worst experience in netherland with rude ignoring staff!! When they brought our order the apple pie was very very cold (maybe frozen) and we asked to be served warm (as it was mentioned in menu) and they took it to warm. After 20 min they …
8,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"1 star is probably generous. Sat here for a good 15 minutes waiting for somebody to get us a menu, only to wait another 10 minutes for a waitress to take our orders in an unbelievably rude manner. Avoid at all cost, do yourselves a favour."
9,Restaurant Stedelijk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The menu was written in Dutch...so I just ordered something that seemed to have an exotic name. ..and I hoped to be cool enough. I received some big shrimps with a potato salad,  a little black bread with a bowl of olive oil. It was …"
10,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This""restaurant"" has terrible staff. We tried to order only two Cokes. There wasn't a single guest at the bar, yet they refused to serve us. He actually GRABBED the glass to fill it but changed his mind, threw his hands up, grumbled and …"
11,Restaurant Stedelijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We actually found this place almost by accident. We had a few moments before our Museum time tickets were available. We were walking along by the van Gogh Museum. Found this Jewel of a place. What an awesome menu fantastic prices. As I have …
12,Restaurant Stedelijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"They have delicious toast with fruits for breakfast. They call it a toast, but it came in a sweet and fruity sauce which made it juicy. They really know how to work with fruit, it was not if this world, I strongly recommend it. …"

14,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worst service ever. I live in this city for almost 5 years and I'm aware that Dutch service is not the best one...but this restaurant exceeds all worst expectation. 45 minutes for a coffee that we ended up cancelling and not even a ""oh, …"
15,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Useless, no organisation so we left before we could even get a menu given to us although seated. We were told not to sit at the tables with menus..... So I reached over to see what secret food they could eventually offer us. Idle time meant we found a better option out of loads within 3 mins of this place ."
16,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Horrible restaurant, avoid at all costs!

Last night I went with my mom and girlfriend to have dinner at Restaurant …"
17,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Rudest restaurant experience I have ever had. After 20 minutes of waiting and being ignored by multiple staff members, the staff member that did speak to me did so to simply say ""I don't have time for you"". Barely deserves the farthest point of a star as a rating."
18,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I was unfortunate enough to have breakfast here while visiting Amsterdam. The service from who I believe to be the world's worst waiter was horrible to say the least treated us with a complete lack of respect, but after ordering our hopes …"
19,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We waited for quite a while at a table on the café/bar side of the restaurant...we then asked two different waitresses if we could order and they just said it was not their job to take orders. When I asked the first one if she could call the appropriate colleague for us she said yes, but guess what... nobody came so we left."

23,Restaurant Stedelijk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The positives are that if you sit in, the establishment is air conditioned, it is spotlessly clean and attached to the
Stedelijk Museum BUT service is incredibly slow and waiting staff simply could …"
24,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,5 years ago,Seems to give the false illusion of demand by failing to accommodate patrons when there is clearly ample room. Perhaps this is an exhibit on post consumerism...
25,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,4 years ago,Disproportional food quality vs price: paid 19.50 Euros for a small plate of Ceasar salad with 4 pieces of small shrimps on + 1 glass of white wine which was borderline vinegar. On top of that really bad service and attitude from staff.  I …
26,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Probably the worst service I have encountered in Europe. Waiters routinely walk past without even bothering to check if we want a menu, to order, coffee or the check. One saw me try to catch her eye and turned around to walk in the opposite direction 😢"
27,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"15 minutes waiting at the bar to be attended... I decide to take a seat. I spend 45 minutes reading my book. I leave without being served.
I just wanted a beer, but I might have become invisible 😓"
28,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"One of the worst dining experiences in a long time. The staff is incredibly rude and unprofessional, the food is quite overpriced and the portions ridiculously small. There is really nothing good to say about this place. I recommend avoiding it."
29,Restaurant Stedelijk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful glass walls connect this museum cafe with the outdoors. Attentive service and speedy kitchen makes a coffee, snack or meal a welcome break from touring any of cultural institutions that front the Museumplein."
30,Restaurant Stedelijk, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Reasonable place to hang out and have drinks & small bites. The menu is quite standard - primarily typical dutch cusine with exception of the risotto, which is quite good (the one with pumkin). Some variety in coctails and a happy hour on the gin-tonic (but includes 'bitterballen' which are quite disgusting)"
31,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Low quality and taste of food, especially for the price and low service - just a lot of waiting. We didn't even get the menu card from start, so had to find it ourself. And the entrances was closed from the museum and elevator, so we had to …"
32,Restaurant Stedelijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very tasty food and nice service. The place was crowded and things took a little time but the personell was so polite and apologizing for delays. We really liked the place.
33,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,4 years ago,Really bad service and the coffee man wanted to bit me when I urge them to give us the bill. Don't go there if you want to have good mood before getting to van gough museum.
34,Restaurant Stedelijk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Fresh food and great taste! Even the fries 😊
35,Restaurant Stedelijk, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Asian platter on the menu was decent, but overpriced. Lemonade is on watery side, nothing special. Nice open space and layout though. Waitress was abit pretentious"
36,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst tourist trap ever. I feel ashamed to be an Amsterdam citizen.  Horrible value for money and the worst service in the city. Simply don't go here, plenty of alternatives to be found nearby!"
37,Restaurant Stedelijk, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice food, a little on the light side quantity-wise but tasty. Expensive but normally so considering the place. Ideal for a snack after a couple of hours with contemporary art"
38,Restaurant Stedelijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Servants are rude. You have to wave at them to make them to serve at your table.
