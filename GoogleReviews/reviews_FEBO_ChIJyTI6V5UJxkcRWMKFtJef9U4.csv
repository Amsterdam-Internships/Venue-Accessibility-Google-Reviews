0,FEBO, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really fun, unique place. The premise is self serving 'lockers' which have a majority of deep fried foods within. These can range from burgers, to croquettes, to sausages etc. ‚Ä¶"
1,FEBO, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A must try at least once while in Amsterdam. Very delicious fried food and the ""vending machine"" like concept is super cool!"
2,FEBO, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Of course it's fast food and majorly consists of deep fried stuff but it's pretty delicious and affordable for Amsterdam. Furthermore it's interesting to see what the real Dutch specialities are. Highly recommended to go there at least once as a tourist.
3,FEBO, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent sausages with curry, other kinds of meals also for vegetarian. First visit and was cheap, fast and delicious. Recommended!"
4,FEBO, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ok where do I start ? This food was actually so good! My boyfriend and I kept passing by these, so after a night of drinking we came here to check it out. It‚Äôs always open which is super convenient. ‚Ä¶"
5,FEBO, 4 stars ,a year ago,"High prices for food quality (skip burger and fries, really). The croquette is a must. Avoid after they just opened as food is not exposed and the shelfs are empty, so you must ask and wait at the counter. Didn't understand the hype nor the prices."
6,FEBO, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Place was clean, and food was better than you'd expect from the vending machine style. A fun late night food option"
7,FEBO, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Not sure what we ate but it was tasty and cheap.

11,FEBO, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A must try in Amsterdam!
Great local snacks."
12,FEBO, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The definition of fast food. And the options make it even better. I loved all kinds of croquettes. Still, i have a feeling that the low prices and small portions keep hooking you to buy more."
13,FEBO, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very cheap most expensive is ‚Ç¨2.70 they have three types of burgers and lots of crunchy paste filled treats and a cheesy bite. Nice place to go if you are feeling like having a snack and there is two of these around :)
14,FEBO, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"That's a really cheap place, but the quality of food and interiors feels even cheaper. ‚Ä¶"
15,FEBO, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best place in the middle of the night when u want sth fast and warm üåÉ
16,FEBO, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cheap meals, self service and open until late. The best place to go to after walking around and partying in Amsterdam. You can have burgers, croquettes, sandwiches, fries. Everything from the lockers and without long queues."
17,FEBO, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place for buy fast food from food-o-mat. Fried food is delicious and for good price. But from my point of view it's not good place to buy Frites, preparation is very slow (about 10-15 minutes) and serving is smaller than in other ‚Ä¶"

19,FEBO, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I was abt to order some food but I wanted to take a photo of food as part of my experience as I am on holidays. The man who worked there put his hand in front of my camera. I was shocked and because of it, I didn't feel like ordering anymore and left. I think he needs to be retrained in customer service."
20,FEBO, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Known this place since I was very young. Always very busy, therefore the food is fresh. Funny to see how tourists love ""our food oit of the wall"""

23,FEBO, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I‚Äôm all on-board for the idea, but the food is terrible. It‚Äôs like fried gravy sticks or a burger on a rock hard bun."
24,FEBO, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"Essential to try if you're a tourist. Hot food vending machine! Perhaps not so essential if you're local.
Might be essential though for an after pub late night snack ;-)"
