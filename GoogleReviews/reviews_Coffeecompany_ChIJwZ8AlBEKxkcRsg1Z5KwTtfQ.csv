0,Coffeecompany, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"This small coffee shop is very comfortable with sofas where you can sit. The coffee is really good. The choice if cakes and pastries is very limited. They are all good but if your goal is to eat something, it is not the right place to go to."
1,Coffeecompany, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"I like the overall atmosphere of this specific location. If you plan to study/work - they have a dedicated table specifically for that. Music is not too loud, and the coffee is decent. They have both espresso and filter coffees which you can pair with a delicious variety of snacks. Highly recommended"
2,Coffeecompany, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great coffee good atmosphere relaxed break from shopping
3,Coffeecompany, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"This is such a good place! They have coffee companys all around the country! I visited so many and I was never disappointed! Most of their coffee is better then Starbucks coffee, and they are cheaper then Starbucks ü§£ though they don't have all of the crazy coffee that Starbucks has to offer. Definitely recommend!"
4,Coffeecompany, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"It's OK, not sure what happened. During COVID the coffee was undrinkable, now it is just OK. Pre Covid it was one of the better coffee places."
5,Coffeecompany, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Nice coffee and good variety of snacks. Love their flat white and filter coffee.
6,Coffeecompany, 5 stars ,a month ago,Nice place in the middle of the mall. Coffee is great.
7,Coffeecompany, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The worst service and bad coffee ever!! I have been to many coffee company in Amsterdam. This is the worst one that I visited. First of all, I ordered a medium size of iced moka with my coffee stamp card; the staff charged me as large size! ‚Ä¶"
8,Coffeecompany, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice place and nice coffee. Open on Sundays is a bonus. Nice atmosphere and very friendly staffs. They have some Dutch and English books as well if you are a vivid reader.

12,Coffeecompany, 4 stars ,11 months ago,"Good to spend some time relaxing in between the shopping...the coffee is good, the pastry ok-ish...the price are a bit high, but it is normal in Amsterdam."
13,Coffeecompany, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice cozy place. Drinks a little bit on the expensive side compared to Starbucks, but the Quality was quite good and I really enjoyed the ambience as well. Definitely would recommend this place for a quick cup of coffee or for getting some work done in a nice comfortable place"
14,Coffeecompany, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"the coffee quality is not really good, so definitely avoid it if you are a coffee lover. In saying that after the 2 chances I have it and thus my rating. Otherwise it's an ok place, good for families as it has toys for children and so you can combine that with a break of your shopping."
15,Coffeecompany, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best Coffee Company I‚Äôve been to so far!
The frozen vanilla cappuccino was way more flavorful than several other CCs I‚Äôve been to before. It is also cheaper than Amsterdam Centrum (which isn‚Äôt that surprising, but still.) They also offer free water with mint and lemon :)"
16,Coffeecompany, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Not too crowded and with tasty coffee. The prices of this coffee chain are ridiculous, though, especially for the small cappuccino, which is tiny like a small espresso! If you want coffee to go, just visit the one next to Albert Heijn instead."
17,Coffeecompany, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I love coffee company in general but this particular joint ALWAYS has employees that just don't think before they act. They were cleaning the CEILING getting dust EVERYWHERE, into the coffee and into our lungs, and this was around 2:30 when ‚Ä¶"
