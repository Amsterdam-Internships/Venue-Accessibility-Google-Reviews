0,Club NYX, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,bizarre venue. really rude staff. I was in a virtually empty smoking area just having a drink with a friend when staff member came over and told me I could not wear a jacket. I explained I wanted to put it in a locker when I came in but ‚Ä¶
1,Club NYX, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,The people taking our tickets yesterday were very unnecessarly rude and they seemed to enjoy the authority they had over us.They wouldn't let us in because we were too many people even if we had valid tickets bought separately. Our friends ‚Ä¶
2,Club NYX, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,Honestly a joke. Bouncers wouldn‚Äôt let us in nor tell us the reason even though we repeatedly asked for information. We were told that they didn‚Äôt have time for us and that we were banned for the night. ‚ÄöTry again next time‚Äò. Funnily ‚Ä¶
3,Club NYX, 1 star ,4 months ago,Would not recommend. Extremely rude staff all around. I was screamed at by a guard for asking a question and they pulled my friend by the jacket (a light one) for wearing it inside which is disrespectful and inappropriate. Treatment of ‚Ä¶
4,Club NYX, 1 star ,4 months ago,If you feel like gambling on your eve the NYX is the place. Note you can only win your eve back. ‚Ä¶
5,Club NYX, 1 star ,4 months ago,Staff was so aggressive I used to come here before corona but now I do not recommend at all. Staff are making problems if you have a jacket? Okay you can say it doesn‚Äôt mean you can resort to physical aggression for something so trivial
6,Club NYX, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place totally different to anything I have ever seen the main dancefloor is good with loud punchy sound and good low end, smart setup for the toilet area as well - very European üòâ would be better if door price wasn't so high or included locker hire"
7,Club NYX, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Do not go to this establishment!!!  On October 22nd, I was physically assaulted by the security personnel who dragged me by my arm, which resulted in me falling and being dragged along the floor.  Never in my life had I been treated like ‚Ä¶"
8,Club NYX, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Last friday was so crowded!! It was impossible to make a step to any direction. Like on the last boat from titanic, you know!! The administration should define some limit. You cant enjoy the evening with tis amount of people inside."
9,Club NYX, 1 star ,7 months ago,This is not a club but a pub. Music is worse than radio. Bar closes at 24 and they denied me a drink at 23:45. Definitely my last time going here.
10,Club NYX, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there in pride week, so the vibe was nice, music is good. Other times it really depends on the dj they have. Smoking area, several floors."
11,Club NYX, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Absolutely love this place where everyone can be who they want to be and have fun ‚ú®
12,Club NYX, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Too packed to dance on the first floor, a lot of grinding against people."
13,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely amazing !!! Two rooms with different music plus a DJ in the bathroom. Atmosphere was brilliant, lots of choices of drinks from the many bars inside the club, including the bathroom. Very friendly staff. Prices, of course, are ‚Ä¶"
14,Club NYX, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It gets a bit packed and the cost for drinks adds up quick, but the atmosphere, music, and staff are great. They also have lockers for 2‚Ç¨ which are convenient if you come in with too many things. I would go again for sure."
15,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great club. If you're planning on coming here, arrive after 12pm,when the various floors open up. The toilets are amazing, dj playing just outside as your having a widdle. Drinks and door entry are reasonable. It has a varied crowd, I'm Caucasian 30+, brilliant night."
16,Club NYX, 1 star ,2 years ago,Wanted to go here for the after party till 9am. I want allowed in as our group (6) was too big. When I asked if we could go in 3 by 3 we were still declined. When I left the rest of the group (5) were allowed in. I feel they discriminate against straight people.
17,Club NYX, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place, friendly staff and good lighting / sound!
The club has 3 different floors. Even the security guards are nice (compared to Paris, it feels nice). You have to go there if you want to experience a gay night in Amsterdam! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà üåà"
18,Club NYX, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Only fun when the place is packed. Good music tho. I like it because it's the only gay club i know of for under 21 in Amsterdam and it's isn't worse then other clubs I've gone to. 3/5 could be worse ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
19,Club NYX, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Canadian girl here. I visited this club on my only night out in Amsterdam and it was exceptional! I had a great time. The atmosphere is so welcoming, the music was amazing and security was so kind. I highly recommend it."
20,Club NYX, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I'm super disappointed with the club.  We decided to go celebrate a birthday of a friend, and besides being able to correctly answer some weird question ""what is the name of the party"" we were denied entrance. To a club that claims to ‚Ä¶"
21,Club NYX, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent club to go out in Amsterdam. You will have a lot of fun. You will find different floors with different kind of music. But the main floor is the highlight. If you want to have good fun, dance yourself to death, go there."
22,Club NYX, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Small and quirky venue but hell of a experience.. been there on Spring Breaks good DJ selection and okay prices .. must see as a part of party tour in Amsterdam.. just to mention quite compact not much room .. sound system could improved .. other than most see !
23,Club NYX, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This places has the vibes! If you're heading to Amsterdam, this is a do not miss party spot which is open into the wee hours of the morning. Spans over three floors, with a great mix of crowd and many more stories waiting to be made by you !"
24,Club NYX, 4 stars ,2 years ago,One of the most popular clubs in Amsterdam. Several floors with different kinds of music. It has different themed nights with several great DJs playing as well as drag shows! ‚Ä¶
25,Club NYX, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I've been going to NYX for years and it's always been my favourite club. The staff is super, the crowd  is always enjoyable and the music is just great. If you're a fan of R&B/HipHop/Dancehall I'd definitely suggest going on one of their Thursdays."
26,Club NYX, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really fun club with 3 levels of dancing. Unique bathroom on the third floor is centered around a DJ. Don‚Äôt miss the illuminated walkway to the smoking room. Coat service via lockers.
27,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to be. Loved that they have a DJ in the bathroom! Careful with the stairs though, they are really steep and can get way too slippery: handrails are available only on one side too."
28,Club NYX, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great music, great vibes, great atmosphere... I love the dancehall and afrobeat music nights  just one thing I would love more updated and new dancehall hits. Have the deejays work on that. As someone coming from the Caribbean it's one of the things I look forward to. Great altogether though."
29,Club NYX, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Unpleasant bouncer ruined the evening for our party, we went in as a group and the bouncer who let us in - very nice guy, but took off a present to me a bottle of whisky and held it til I came out.  As I went out I went to get it back, but ‚Ä¶"
30,Club NYX, 5 stars ,a year ago,Stunning experience. Everything I could have ever dreamed of in more. One of the best spots in Amsterdam. Highly recommend attending if you can get on a list.
31,Club NYX, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is a favorite to go dancing and to have a good time. Although many places in Amsterdam have the LGBT flag, few places are really open and make you feel so well and free as NYX. Definitely a gotta go for anyone seeking a night to remember! Have fun!"
32,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"'... Awesome!'
4 DJs playing different really awesome music in different sections of the club. It's like having a fruit salad with all your favourite fruits in it. It was simply awesome..."
33,Club NYX, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"My opinion of Nyx has greatly changed. I went here a handful of times when I first moved to Amsterdam and I didn‚Äôt really have a good time. But I went last night for the 3x event and it was AMAZING. The music was great, everyone was having ‚Ä¶"
34,Club NYX, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is nice yet clouded. But honestly, the only place to be on Saturdays is the toilet. They put the best, not bubbling pop remix of every song remix, in the toilet! ‚Ä¶"
35,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome club! I had a fantastic Friday night there (Yah Yah). The audience is very diverse and made a pleasant atmosphere. Drinks were not very expensive nor were the entrance.
36,Club NYX, 1 star ,3 years ago,"For a gay space, this doesn't cater to gay people one bit! Went there last night and was just bombarded by straight people. People gave me dirty looks and made me feel unwanted in my own space. I think this club should make sure that if ‚Ä¶"
37,Club NYX, 1 star ,3 years ago,"If you can, please avoid or be careful. The bouncers tend to be extremely aggressive (one of them broke my wrist), and the managers will not acknowledge these faults. ‚Ä¶"
38,Club NYX, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The younger crowd is ready to wait in line to get into this hidden-away Amsterdam rave club. Within a spectacularly decorated space, house music and R&B is played live by DJs on each floor. With four bars on three floors, this club feels ‚Ä¶"
39,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best club ever!!! 3 floors of dancing space & all of them different genres of music üòç Also love the fact that they decorate the venue depending on the theme of the night
40,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cool club in Amstersam. We had an amazing time. Music is amazing, you'll have 3 rooms with different genres you can pick from. We didn't wait for too long on the queue either."
41,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"best place on earth. i came here for NYE & NYD 2019/20 and i literally had the time of my life. everyone is so lovely and carefree and so great to talk to, the staff are amazing literally all of them. i can‚Äôt compare this club to any i‚Äôve ‚Ä¶"
42,Club NYX, 1 star ,3 years ago,"They talk about inclusivity and openness. My group of friends eagerly queued and queued excited to be part of the good vibes, only to be told by a sassy man that groups weren't allowed. It's painfully ironic and everything a club shouldn't ‚Ä¶"
43,Club NYX, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Love the place, but they need to work on the variety of the music"
44,Club NYX, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Different areas, on different floors, with different types of music. Very nice atmosphere and interior. Entrance fee pretty average. Crowded on Saturdays but that's usual for a club. Ideal for everyone."
45,Club NYX, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Different rooms, each with its own music and vibe. Music isn't too loud. Overall experience is fun but price for entry and beer are both way too high."
46,Club NYX, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The club is awesome with great music, funky interior and cheap drinks. But considering there are only 1/5th of gay ppl inside, and the rest is girls and stag parties, it's not really a gay club if that's what you're looking for :("
47,Club NYX, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice open minded club with nice staff, great drinks and a different dj on each floor! Great place to go wild, even on sunday. ‚Ä¶"
48,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Unique vibe. Symbolic for the open and relaxed vibe amsterdam has to offer in terms of clubs. Everybody chill with each other and the good thing is that you don't know who is hitting on who...
49,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Honestly the best club I have been to in all cities, coming from london I wish we had a gem like this club. As a queer environment it felt like almost a community vibe was going on, worth the visit."
50,Club NYX, 1 star ,3 years ago,Terrible Terrible Experience I would definitely give zero star if I could. this is my worst travel in the gay club forever as a gay traveler !!!! I was there on Staturgay day. The people in front of me has to pay ‚Ç¨4.5 which they are ‚Ä¶
51,Club NYX, 1 star ,2 years ago,Not inclusive. I felt very shamed and rejected. It's very clicquey (good luck getting in if you're not giving the bouncer head). Would not recommend even trying. Disgusted. Judgemental place that wouldn't know LQBTQ+ if it hit them in the ‚Ä¶
52,Club NYX, 1 star ,4 years ago,The guards treat you terribly. Even though we had payed for the ticket we were not allowed back in. On top of that they threatened my friends to hurt them if they continued to complain and even assaulted one of them. Stay away from this place. The club itself is pretty mediocre as well. Much better places in Amsterdam.
53,Club NYX, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fun club in gay area in Amsterdam. Friendly staff and good music. Entrance was 12.5 euros per person which is not cheap.
54,Club NYX, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great club, awesome sound system and great staff! If you're looking for something fresh and open minded this is the place to be. Different floors and rooms so there is always something to discover!"
55,Club NYX, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Honestly don‚Äôt understand all the bad reviews! was there last night celebrating my birthday, great dancefloor with nice hits, and a lot of diversity and openmindedness in people! Had a fantastic night out."
56,Club NYX, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Was rudely turned away by the xenophobic doorman. Just like the other reviews here, this club seems to have a racist stance against tourists. Do not bother lining up if you do not speak Dutch, you'll just be turned away."
57,Club NYX, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Music was okay (for me not the best mix, too much hard electro/techno and too less charts), nice staff, very tasty drinks! Great for partying even in a Friday."
58,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice music, friendly guests & workers although quite small dancing floors... perfect night out for students/youth..., amazing experience"
59,Club NYX, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Unfriendly staff. Halloween Night. Lockers are ‚Ç¨2, i inserted ‚Ç¨1 and ‚Ç¨1 coin, locker didn't work still. I asked a member of staff, he was very rude, arrogant and unhelpful, saying it was my own fault! Later when my friend arrived, a ‚Ä¶"
60,Club NYX, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Every Saturday is SaturGAY! There are 3 areas, so music for everyone. The staff is always nice and willing to help you! What i love the most about club NYX are the 3 areas, always a place to dance with good music!"
61,Club NYX, 5 stars ,4 years ago,You won't see a better balloon arch in Amsterdam. One not to be missed!!
62,Club NYX, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Unsettlingly narrow dance rooms and seems so strange to see a smoking room in a club these days, but NYX certainly does have a certain charm and is a gay club worth visiting."
63,Club NYX, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The bouncer should be totally ashamed of himself. I was denied entry being told it is only for ""familiar face"" on a Friday night. How did he know that I'm not a familiar face? There was no check on the computer system. Did he know all the ‚Ä¶"
64,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"music was absolutely amazingggg, expensive drinks and entry but honestly worth it because the atmosphere in here was insane. would definitlety reccommend for a night of dancing the entire time!"
65,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Ik was fun and music was wonderfull! It was not to crowded or hot. Only down side is dat the floor is so sticky at some point that you cant really dance anymore
66,Club NYX, 1 star ,2 years ago,All night we drink with my man in NYX ..spend lot of money for coctails and about 4 oclock we decide to go outside to get fresh air... but when we try to comeback the doorman stop us and say he is cant let us come in coz my man is drunk ‚Ä¶
67,Club NYX, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Fun place to go out. Gay + gay-friendly + straight-friendly + straight. Depending on the night you go. Mostly dance/house/techno, but with special nights/parties with more pop or hiphop."
68,Club NYX, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I'm here pretty much every saterday, the most gay night at Club Nyx, each week the parties are awesome and Laurien (doorbitch) is always dressed the coolest in pretty much whole Amsterdam. The music is grear for everyone, as it's different on every floor. Def a recommendation!"
69,Club NYX, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I love club NYX the crowd is perfectly mixed that's makes it very relaxing. Also good mix of music style over 3 floors :) The toilet DJs are wicked
70,Club NYX, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty good place if you don't mind an expensive entrance fee and drinks. The crowd can be a bit too crowded on some nights which ruins the vibe.
71,Club NYX, 1 star ,7 years ago,Bad experience at the cloakroom getting jacket back. Item was missing from it. No apologies. The girl who was the manager and the main guy with headsets on working at the cloakroom were not understanding and were unhelpful. Very unhuman ‚Ä¶
72,Club NYX, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Just like G-A-Y in London or Manchester or Heaven in London, packed with mainstream gays who don't know how to party.
3x NYX? 3x sh't! ‚Ä¶"
73,Club NYX, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Every Saturday I visit Club Nyx to party at 3x Nyx, cause Saturday equals Saturgay! üéâ I'm always welcomed by the lovely door host: Laurien ‚ù§ Everyone has their own taste in music and Nyx really understands that by offering different rooms ‚Ä¶"
74,Club NYX, 1 star ,4 years ago,I am 35 years old Danish guy.. and 20 minutes ago the ‚Äúdoorman‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt let me in to Club NYX.. saying I was  to drunk.. sorry Club NYX but seriously?!? This was a hate crime against a danish hetero-normative gay guy!! Don‚Äôt go to that club!!
75,Club NYX, 1 star ,2 years ago,Faced the warmth of racism when I first visited in 2019.  From the crowd to the patrons it was evident we weren't Invited. Perhaps that's the same in AMS!!!
76,Club NYX, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,Very cold
77,Club NYX, 1 star ,a year ago,"We had a very unpleasant encounter with the people who work there!
They charged us with more than we had and not even trying to find a solution! ‚Ä¶"
78,Club NYX, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice club, always a good party. 10 euro entrance fee is a bit steep though, especially since the drinks are not quite affordable either."
79,Club NYX, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A great place if you feel like dancing, even on a Sunday it gets pretty wild here, the Thursdays are also recommended, 3 floors of craziness, even a dancefloor around the toilets, love it!"
80,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cool place, just going from one room to the next is such a vibe change it's like an acid trip. Just go, you'll love it."
81,Club NYX, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place for a night out! Be sure to bring ear plugs tho - dj‚Äôs can be a bit deaf
82,Club NYX, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Overpriced, music was good, but interior was mediocre."
83,Club NYX, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I would call it young and loud and energetic. Great place for a beer or two. Gets crowded over weekends.
84,Club NYX, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best place for gays and lesbians with a lots of young audience and good music. Its a dance club actually.
85,Club NYX, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty awesome but so strange that the toilet is all the way up the stairs behind the DJ, no door yes just behind the DJ for all to see"
86,Club NYX, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Nice songs but very small place! Be careful of stupid people who push u to get through!
87,Club NYX, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great club. Nice music if you like hip hop & RnB. Cool architecture (3 level)
88,Club NYX, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Good music and nice people. Give me more of this please!
89,Club NYX, 1 star ,4 years ago,Worst place ever. They do gay hate crime against people. We had fun in the queue and the was told we where to drunk and was not allowed to enter. Don't support this disco
90,Club NYX, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible expirience, they told my parent and I that the tiquets where all sold, wasent true, they just dindt like us for I dont know why. Please, gay comunity is openess and LOVE!"
91,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hot club with open mindset and various styles and themes. R&B, hip-hop, Dance Hall"
92,Club NYX, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"If you like commercial and pop music, NYX is not the place to go, especially because there is an entrance fee"
93,Club NYX, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, electronic music all night long. You can even party on the toilets"
94,Club NYX, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I had the best night of my life here! Thank you for A wonderful atmosphere and good music!!!
95,Club NYX, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"very great music, very kind staff but gays be aware...the white straight men and their aggression have taken over!"

98,Club NYX, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious, crazy, creative, different spaces, multicultural and free. No complain. Just too hot inside"
99,Club NYX, 1 star ,2 years ago,I think we got turned away (after queueing for half an hour) because we didn't look gay enough. Cool inclusivity üëå

121,Club NYX, 1 star ,2 years ago,idiot club taking 10ppls to there with their event tickets and they refuse as just because one of us looks like drunk.
122,Club NYX, 1 star ,5 years ago,This is not a gay place! I thought I could have some fun in this place. I was totally wrong. I'll never come back.
123,Club NYX, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Nightclub for openminded party people. Just be nice and know what's playing to make sure you get in.
