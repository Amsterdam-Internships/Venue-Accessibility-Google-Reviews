0,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,5 months ago,One of the premier locations in amsterdam for Magic: The Gathering events. Wednesday evening: free casual EDH nights
1,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice place, authentic atmosphere. The owner/bartender is the best. Super relaxt. Also have a vegetarian burger on the menu. Super affordable! Pay by card also possible."
2,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I was unexpectedly impressed with this place! But remember CASH only.

Biking by it, it doesn’t look like much. Mainly an older demographic you see in …"
3,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Friendly staff, lot of games available and good place to organize game events like tournaments."
4,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great atmosphere, service and very reasonable prices. All in all a great place to sit down and get a couple games in!"
5,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 4 stars ,a year ago,"It wasn't a fancy place, but the food was good and homemade. It was a good deal as well."
6,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great atmosphere, friendly service & a whole bookcase-wall of boardgames!!"
7,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Super nice crowd! Great guy in front of me ! Love it !!!! Great veggie burger 😘
8,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place if you are looking for a night playing board games with your friends. Advisable to book in advance since the place does get a bit busy. The games collection itself is huge. Loved their house wine. The staff could be a bit more friendly though.
9,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent beer and coffee, good atmosphere and friendly staff. Plenty of games in stock, but it's ok to bring your own. Kitchen available, don't expect a full restaurant-like menu but it is more than decent for a venue this size."
10,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a wonderful place. Full of board games and ocasionally hosting small events for board games, this place brings many expats and fans of any type of games together. A lot of backgammon players there too. Prices might be slightly high, but grabbing a cappuccino and playing for longer time is not a problem."
11,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 4 stars ,a month ago,"They added a new payment method: (bank) CARDS! No need to find a cash point anymore, but they are hesitant to accept cards for small amounts."
12,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 4 stars ,7 months ago,My Monday spot. Old fashioned. They have magic the gathering tournaments here.
13,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Nice place but feel very ripped-off. Friend ordered pint of Leffe beer; however, she did not receive a pint - she received a normal glass (around 330ml) and was charged 11.75 Euros. Normal price of this beer is 4 or 5 euros. Felt the …"
14,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"This is a very local, almost divey bar.

I'm not sure if they don't like Americans or they are like this to everyone, but …"
15,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing place, friendly staff, very good selection of board games. We enjoyed our visit a lot."
16,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 1 star ,2 years ago,The waitress was super rude to us. To another level of just disliking people for no reason at all. Telling other people to just take our table. Even other customers had to defend us and were complaining of how rude and unfair she was treating us. We will never go back again there. Don’t recommend this place at all!!
17,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Ground floor is a Cafe / bar, and there are various board games to play. The basement is an open area where you can sit, have food and drink, and play games. While I was there, a Magic:the Gathering tournament was going on."
18,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly staff and customers. Has an older crowd socialising and playing cards or other games. Light and sunny. Great place to do my Dutch homework.
19,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is very down to earth, the service is uneven, but their board games and their hosting nerdy events earns this place a very special place in the area, and indeed in Amsterdam. Roleplay evenings, Magic launch parties, or Hearthstone tournaments happen there, and nowhere else!"
20,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great selection of games. local FNM is organised here. not too expensive either in terms of food and drinks. usually packed with people.
21,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good beer, great burgers. Assortment of board games could be improved. Just the bare basics are present"
22,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lots of great games and nice, cozy atmosphere with sunny spots outside to sit!

Keep in mind it's cash only."
23,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Good selection of beer and games.  It's also neat to watch the drawbridge.  The burger and fries were really good too.
24,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely bar. Very nice home made ice tea. Nice place to play a game.
25,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place to play live different games, matches, tournaments.
Very special interesting , - BACKGAMMON  tournaments every Wednesday evening and Sunday"
26,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 4 stars ,3 years ago,You can play lots of board games. There are a couple of special beers to choose from but not that much.
27,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great games and nice themed days but a little lacking in food/drink options. Very poor vegetarian choices.
28,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cozy atmosphere...friendly, helpful staff...delicious coffee and food

32,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The games were nice but the floor was from stone, which made all the sounds echo. The snacks were also not that good"
33,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 5 stars ,5 months ago,nice aura
34,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Prices are alright and service is ok. However you have to be part of the type of crowd that visit game-bars.

37,Spelletjescaf√© 2 Klaveren, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice board games, but shabby looking and not much of a cosy atmosphere."
