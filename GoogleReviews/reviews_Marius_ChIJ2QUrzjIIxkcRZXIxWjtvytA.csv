3,Marius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was superb, the staff was super friendly and the restaurant was in general lovely. Absolutely worth a visit!"
4,Marius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Marius has exceptionally great food and outstanding service. Wish I could afford to go here more often (we paid ‚Ç¨75 pp for a 4-course dinner, few glasses of high end wines and sparkling water). They do everything to accommodate you."

7,Marius, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We made reservations about a month in advance - boy are we glad we did. This meal was unlike any other we've had in New York. We had the four course dinner. Not one of the dishes were overridden with sauces or salt - we could clearly taste ‚Ä¶

9,Marius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We walked here from the city centre.
The walk was long but it was worth it. We had the set menu and and wine package and it was worth every penny. The service was good but the waiters forgot to bring wine before the dishes, which is the only complaint I have."
10,Marius, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice French bistro style restaurant serving dinner in a small size space tucked away in a quiet neighborhood.  Food is Excellent, service is friendly. The owners typically come around and talk to customers.  Good wine list. Very nice experience."

13,Marius, 3 stars ,11 years ago,"We found this restaurant hyped as one of the best four in Amsterdam, which might be true, but were eventually not entirely convinced by it. We ended up paying 130‚Ç¨ for a meal for two people, and at least a couple of the dishes weren't on ‚Ä¶"
