0,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,2 months ago,I tiny bar where Rembrandt may have possibly sold his paintings for 3 guilders! (But don‚Äôt quote me!)
1,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Perfect spot, we stumbled upon this very famous place by accident and so glad we did. The service was great and the atmosphere was very relaxed, a perfect dog-friendly spot to rest in the sweltering heat in Amsterdam."
2,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very old and charming building. It‚Äôs crowded for a reason. Wonderful location to sit, have a pint, or three, and nibble on Bitterballen. Bitterballen are round tasty little bites of fried meaty yumminess served with mustard. We sat on the ‚Ä¶"
3,Sluyswacht, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Small, often very busy, but when the sun is out quite nice to sit down and have a bite to eat. I return every time for their tosti's, which are always good to eat. ‚Ä¶"
4,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Good vibes, great location and very kind waiter, all for a reasonable price."
5,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Cute cafe by the canal, ideal to spend a rainy afternoon.
The service is very friendly."
6,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A beautiful and historical pub precariously perched on the canal. Great outdoor seating and mix of people. It is a must to stop in for a few drinks or a cup of coffee. The bartenders are great, they are fast and very personable even when ‚Ä¶"
7,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Very polite and friendly service. Many locals. Great small snacks.
8,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The bar has an amazing view of the canals and the staff was really friendly. I recommend to try the Dutch meat balls, they were really tasty."
9,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the atmosphere üòçüòçüòç what's such a great experience, sat nearby the river, drank a good beer in the cafe 300 year-old"
10,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Such a cosy place with great views and affordable drinks (wines for 4 euros, Gin Tonics around 9 euros). There are blankets for when it's cold outside but still want to enjoy the great views. Inside however is really small and smelly (old beer aromas), with a sticky floor. Toilets are clean."
11,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good place to grab drinks and snacks while sitting outside enjoying the view. Friendly staff. Free wifi.
12,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The cappuccino tasted great.The stuff was very polite and friendly. Would definitely recommend and visit again.
13,Sluyswacht, 1 star ,2 years ago,The worst bar I went in Amsterdam. We went there in 10 people group but no one was satisfied with their service. The glasses were not clean and when we objected for this they just laughed! I think the only interesting thing here was their ‚Ä¶
14,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely place to visit, good atmosphere, somewhere in the center! Nice personal and original beers! Recommended!"
15,Sluyswacht, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Waited 10 minutes to get a menu, another 15 to order 3 beers and finally just walked off after another 20 elapsed. The restaurant was at less than half capacity. Lame."
16,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great old 17th century cafe across from Rembrandt museum. Have a Kwak beer there and rest watching canal activities.
17,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Super cool and cozy place. They even have phone chargers with proper lockers. Beers are great and the location itself is unique. Also the service is fast and super efficient.
18,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great view, great service"
19,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very friendly staff, cozy place and tasty coffee!"
20,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cute cafe house with good beer options, although not much wine. Beautiful views of the canal in a charming old house with very slanted floors which actually added to the charm. The food menu could be a little better. I do not recommend the fried cheese at all but the croquettes weren‚Äôt bad."
21,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This place has tremendous vibes. The bar itslef is tiny, and there is little indoor seating. But the outdoor patio overlooking the canals is perfect, especially for a nice day. There are a few (not a ton) communal tables on the patio. It gets packed and loud later in the day, so try to come on a weekday before 4pm if you want a spot."
22,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Lovely quaint pub in a lovely part of Amsterdam
23,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice place to have a few drinks and something to eat with a nice view.
24,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Looks great. Unfortunately closed due to COVID restrictions, like all other places"
25,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really great flat white in a really old building.
Atmosphere very unique, good tunes."
26,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Super cute spot. Nice view on the canal. Expect typical Dutch borrel snacks and some good beers,  even tastier under the sun, that you can enjoy in their outdoor space."
27,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Nice! No more words needed.
28,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great spot, friendly service and delicious snacks."
29,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great view, and nice bar food."
30,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Incredible place next to the canals with a nice view to have a bier or coffee.
31,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very nice place by the canal. Great food
32,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A great place to drink beer and look at boats that sail the river
33,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My new local beer spot!  cozy and a nice range of beers on tap!  building is an old bridge watch and built in traditional Amsterdam style which means it leans a bit.  Also seems to have a beautiful terrace for the summer and a view to the ‚Ä¶
34,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A great place for a drink and cheese and bitterballen. The building itself from the outside is somewhat subsided. Don't let this fool you as the inside matches and can make you feel like your beer is stronger than it is! The staff here were great and the atmosphere is very chilled and comfortable.
35,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favorite cafe in Amsterdam. We stumbled across this place on our way back from the town center and sat upstairs. We had an awesome view of the canal and enjoyed watching boats go by. This place also has a great terrace, but it was a little too cold for us Californians to sit outside when we visited."
36,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Gorgeous, petite building, 100% recommend to grab a table outside the view on the canal is gorgeous. The food and drink is very reasonable unlike other areas in the city. Only thing that I didnt like was the restrooms,  dangerous stairs narrow and slippy."
37,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice beers in here and friendly staff. Very bright considering it's quite small. ‚Ä¶
38,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,a year ago,It's nice that they have outdoor tables with heating. I wouldn't like to stay inside during Covid times. You can stay there during cold September nights as well.
39,Sluyswacht, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Historic, charming little building. The menu and decoration is not very original and it's often pretty crowded. But the terrace is actually quite tranquil for how central this establishment is located."
40,Sluyswacht, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Thought this would be a nice place to grab a drink and early dinner. Instead of the ""cozy"" atmosphere claimed by so many reviewers, I found a bar full of bartenders who were loud, inconsiderate and downright obnoxious. Not what I would have ‚Ä¶"
41,Sluyswacht, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Good place for drinks near the water. They serve hardly anything fresh, so alcohol or standard tea/coffee is what you can expect. It was very windy the time I was there, but thankfully the waiters had attached menus to the table so they didn't fall into the canal."
42,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome watering hole with outstanding Dutch finger food (also try the delicious french fries).  If you sit outside in the back, you'll enjoy the scenic views down the canal to the NEMO.  Just a relaxing place to drink beer and watch the canal boats go by.  All this comes with a very affordable food and drink menu."
43,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best vibes and view!
44,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing old pub in Amsterdam, the building is slightly crooked for the years.
We payed 8 euro for each beer, I think it's bit pricey even though the Place Is cool."
45,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Different beers, good fingerfood, nice location"
46,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A nice small place to drink by the sluys tower that has a history behind it.. we can still see the gates through which boats used to sail and taxes were collected. First floor has a better view of all four directions.
47,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Go to this pub. The building is on a canal, and is falling over...or has, at least, tipped over quite a bit over the hundreds of years it has been in existence. The beer is fine, the prices are average, the staff are really nice, but this place gets aces all around for atmosphere. It's just comfortable."
48,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best views in Amsterdam for enjoying ur drink or eating. It is a great place to make a party. Enough space&service was so good&fast. Love the boats passing by all the time. Totally recommended!
49,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Got here after visiting one of the nearby coffee shops. It has a great vibe inside, and the slightly slanted interior makes it very interesting - if you don't look outside the windows, you will feel that something is not exactly right :) It is a great place to drop by either after visiting the Rembrandt museum, or a nearby coffee shop!"
50,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place for draft beer, nice atmosphere. With a visit"
51,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Have a beer. Enjoy the view.
Away from the crowds.
Have some bites."
52,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Superb beer and surprisingly excellent nibbley food; best curly fries I've had in a long time. Also if you're sat outside by the water you get to be in loads of photos being taken by the boat tours going by.
53,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice bar close to the canal, with beautiful views during day and night. They have some finger food options too, typical Dutch pub food.
The place is quite picturesque, due to the tilt of the building."
54,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Effing adorable and a must. Good wings toooo. Will return everytime. My place.
55,Sluyswacht, 3 stars ,6 months ago,It's the location that distinguish this place from many similar places around.
56,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,5 years ago,A crocked bar in a very nice location in Amsterdam. The beer is fair priced and they have a good selection. The service is ok. The view is pretty nice :). It is a good place for a chilled late afternoon drinking beer.
57,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Bar is next to a small dam in the canels, Really cool location. Has nice outdoor seating. Only downside is that it is often full with Dutch student associations."
58,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It was very promising from the outside, we noticed it while on a canal ride. Went there with probably high expectations of coziness and niceness. It was a pretty average bar with average service, though it did have nice interior."
59,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This might be my favorite place in Amsterdam to sit outside and have a drink.
60,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent location and view,  friendly environment,  positive vibe, friendly staff, not overcharged prices. A perfect spot to have a drink before or after the Rembrandt museum!"

67,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"A classy place, with a excellent view"
68,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place to have a beer or drink after walking around Amsterdam. You have a view of boats passing by. Took a beer and cheeses,al fresco with a friend."
69,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"From a world traveler, sitting on the patio at the caf√© s is one of my favorite places on planet earth to relax and collect my thoughts.  Truly beautiful place to take in the beauty of Amsterdam."
70,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent beer selection and lovely seating along a canal. Food options were tasty, but limited"
71,Sluyswacht, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"It's more than 20 minutes since we entered, they already cleaned our table but we are still waiting for someone to ask what we want or even say HELLO. Worst service ever and it's not the first time. Because of the beatiful location and place they can afford to be arrogant. What a pity..."
72,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cute spot, beautiful view up top, and was pretty full on the bottom. Fried croquettes were AMAZING, and the mustard sauce hit the spot"
73,Sluyswacht, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Original place, not too expensive. Don't forget your belongings there though, only half of it will still be there when you come back to grab it, even though you had confirmation everything was there on the phone before."
74,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cozy place and very good Bier. Not too expensive, the place is just perfect. Good for tourists, great music and and people! Recommended"
75,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very lovely spot, great beer, limited but tasty menu, friendly staff. Perfect for a sunny afternoon!"
76,Sluyswacht, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"There in September.  Snacks were fine, service not so much. Had to ask 3 servers and wait over 30 minutes for my appetizer to arrive"
77,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great view of the canal on a good day. Friendly staff. Slightly overpriced drink but bar snacks are reasonably priced to counter it.
78,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Typical cafe in Amsterdam. Very Dutch. Had a sign above the bar congratulating two girls (regulars presumably) for having the best breasts this month. Interesting.
79,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the oldest bars in Amsterdam I highly recommend anybody and everybody have visit and grab a pint!! Love Cafe de Sluyswacht!
80,Sluyswacht, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Went in planning to have a drink and some food, but we had no luck getting served. I ordered drinks at the bar and grabbed a table upstairs. The bartender said he would bring them up, but after waiting 10 minutes, I went downstairs to check on things. Our bartender was nowhere to be found, so we left..."
81,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,7 years ago,The location is great.  You can sit outside and view all of the boats passing by in the canal while you enjoy some good brews.
82,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Uniquely Amsterdam! The most crooked bar around with a romantic, cozy interior, good modest priced drinks. Great spot"
83,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It's a simple bar - but location (and, well, the place itself) is amazing (beer and snacks are good too though)."
84,Sluyswacht, 1 star ,4 years ago,"So the translation from Dutch ""cafe de Sluyswacht"" to English is also ""cafe de Sluyswacht""?! Wow I'm so pleased that you have published your name twice! No, I don't think you've got any quality"
85,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Peculiar cafe, from an old Amsterdam building, with more than 300 years. Good drinks available and great location"
86,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A nice place for celebrations/parties. Upper floor is spacious for 30-40 people. Good service.

88,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Dutch bar, interesting layout, laid back feeling.

The waitress is very nice and serves in a delightful way."
89,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very special bar, housed almost in the canal. Be very careful, your beer can drop out of the glass without noticing!"
90,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good atmosphere. It lies at an angle so it feels like you've already had a couple of beers as you enter.
91,Sluyswacht, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Thanks for not taking care of the noise screaming drunk people make on your  premises, forcing the entire neighbourhood to live with absurd levels of noise pollution, even way past midnight. We have send another complaint to the local council."
92,Sluyswacht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The two ( male) servers working today handled a huge crowd with ease. Great experience and the food was great too!
93,Sluyswacht, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Meh. It's nice from the outside but the inside isn't up to much. Take a look at the facia and then head to one of the far superior brown bar interiors.
94,Sluyswacht, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice location in the busy centre of Amsterdam. Good for drinks and bytes. Terrace at the water.
