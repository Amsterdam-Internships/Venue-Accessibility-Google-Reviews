4,Ruby, 4 stars ,a year ago,We found this Chinese restaurant in the shopping mall near Novotel Hotel.  It was late at night and it is the few restaurant still open.  The food is so good that we didn't take any photo as we are very hungry.  It is very popular as people lining outside for a table.  The staff is also very nice.

8,Ruby, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very friendly staff and the food is outstanding. Go hungry and get the 3 tapas dishes deal. You won't be disappointed.
9,Ruby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ruby has been a great place to eat Asian food for a long time now. The refurbished ambience and the new “tapas-style” menu have made it even better. They pay great attention to the food and the service, and the family that runs the place is always warm and welcoming. Highly recommended!"

11,Ruby, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Not a lot of food options in this area and was staying in the next door hotel and was given a recommendation to go here. Did the 30 euro 3 part tapas (with side) twice to get 6 options, which was nice to try many different things however …"
12,Ruby, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good restaurant serving tasty food. The ambiance was nice too. Prices were decent except for the Chinese tea which I'm used to being for free or £1 a person and not the same price as a beer. …

20,Ruby, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Exquisite Asian cuisine in a sophisticated and quiet setting. The 'tapas' formula is a clever menu solution. We were a party of five and were happily sharing a multitude of well presented dishes.
21,Ruby, 1 star ,4 years ago,"My friend ordered pork fried rice and I ordered pork WITH fried rice and veg. We paid the same price but my friend got a much smaller dish. When I complained the manager answered: “If you want, I can charge you more”. We felt she was quite rude and unapologetic"
