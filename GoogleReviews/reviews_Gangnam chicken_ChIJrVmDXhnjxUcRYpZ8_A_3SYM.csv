1,Gangnam chicken, 3 stars ,a month ago,A very small cozy place. There are a few table where you can eat in. It is a nice place for gathering and if you are fried chicken lover. There were three Korean styles flavor you can choose but I recommend the spicy one won't disappoint ‚Ä¶

17,Gangnam chicken, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Ordered here for the first time. Regular chicken wings are ok, but not superb. The boneless chicken with honey/lemon sauce was better! Also a large portion of sweet potato fries. And great packaging design. Would recommend and order again :)"
18,Gangnam chicken, 1 star ,a month ago,"I placed an order on deliveroo, I get the message that my order is in preparation and ready to arrive.  after 40 minutes of waiting and after paying, the rider almost near my house calls me and tells me that they do not accept orders on ‚Ä¶"

20,Gangnam chicken, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Gangnam chicken has delicious crispy wings,drumsticks etc with a twist of sauces! I think the crispyness of the chicken comes from a rice base starch flour  for the hard crunchy bits. They also have sides which you can order which completes ‚Ä¶"
21,Gangnam chicken, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The chicken was tender but tasted okay, not very bad but also not very good. We took two flavors: soy sauce and honey. And they tasted almost the same. The honey sauce was overwhelmed with sweetness of the honey itself and soy sauce lacked ‚Ä¶"
22,Gangnam chicken, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"I absolutely love Gangnam as I have eaten here probably 30+ times, however recently there has been some major concerns. First, the new fries are extremely disappointing compared to their old skinny fries. We now avoid ordering them ‚Ä¶"
23,Gangnam chicken, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Sad to see another fine establishment go in the gutter. Used to order from them all the time, but never again. No more sweet potato fries, no Welch‚Äôs sodas, and half of my order was missing. Hard to believe it used to be perfect every time."
24,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Gangnam chicken is one of my absolute favorite chicken places ever! Literally so so good. I especially recommend the pickled radish to have on the side with your chicken... really helps to cleanse your palette. However, I really wish they ‚Ä¶"

26,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"love the chicken here! they have chicken drumsticks, wings or boneless thighs which are great. The honey and lemon is lovely but my favourite is the garlic and soy sauce. really nice and full of flavour. meat isnt dry at all."
27,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,9 months ago,The whole family quite enjoyed the meal.  We got drummettes and wings in all three flavors. The favorite is the Spicy Korean Pepper. It was the perfect amount of kick for me. We found out after that you could order even spicier which the ‚Ä¶

31,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,a year ago,One of the best Korean fried chicken in Amsterdam! I‚Äôve ordered a few times and the quality is consistent and super delicious. I love the honey lemon boneless! I do recommend making the pieces of chicken smaller pieces to eat. Also the Welchs Korean soda adds such a great touch to the meal. Great taste üëèüèºüòä!
32,Gangnam chicken, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"The pickled radishes was lekker, but the chicken tasted one dimensional. The soy garlic sauce was just sugar, no saltiness or garlic detected. The gochujang sauce was slightly better but still too sweet, very little heat and no saltiness. The chicken is very reminiscent to Korean fried chicken but the sauces need looking at."
33,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Has been my go-to delivery option for that sweet-spicy-crunchy craving one get in Amsterdam from time to time. Feels like good quality chicken and batter and also the oil used for frying. ‚Ä¶

40,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best fried chicken in Amsterdam! Have been ordering here for almost a year now and still haven't found better. Other than the chicken, the sweet potato fries are perfectly done, and the vegetarian sides are great as well. As for sauce, I always get the Gochujang Mayo -- I even save some of it to use on home-cooked meals ;)"
41,Gangnam chicken, 2 stars ,6 months ago,Although they have nice chiken they dont really care about what they are serving that much. I ordered chicken with soy-garlic sauce but it was obviously with some other saucez Eventhough i told them the really didnt care that much.

45,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,a year ago,"10/10 would recommend! The chicken is very good and the sides as well. We had all three types of sauces and if you like spicy, definitely get the spicy sauce. The boneless wings are the best. The sweet potato fries, fried asparagus and rice ‚Ä¶"
46,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Very nice place with Korean style fried chicken. Around 8 euro for a set of chicken.  Interesting snacks, kimchi, sweet potato fries and more. Inside there is a free video game, really cool street fighters etc."
47,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,a year ago,Really great simple chicken with crispy skin and flavourful sauces. The rice and sweet potato fries sides are delicious sides as well. The boneless chicken has a nice crunch and tenderness to it.
48,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,a year ago,"If you order it at the right time (not too busy) the takeaway is still crispy, juicy and kickin. I even ordered after midnight and the chicken and cauliflower were clearly fresh. ‚Ä¶"
49,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,a year ago,Frankly there are no other restaurants in Amsterdam that I think about as much as Gangnam Chicken. It's not so much a restaurant as my religion. I just ordered it drunk on a Wednesday a few hours before closing time and it was as perfect as ‚Ä¶

55,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Don‚Äôt be surprised if you find the best fried chicken in Amsterdam here! If you fancy something green then asparagus is a perfect alternative.

57,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Been here several times now, always digging their soy garlic chicken and sweet potato fries. The rice is a very nice side dish. Staff is attentive and the owner cares a lot about the quality of the food. Hope you guys can expand! =)"

64,Gangnam chicken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Chicken is very juicy and the portion of sweet potato fries is huuuuuge!
65,Gangnam chicken, 1 star ,7 months ago,Ordered drumettes. It was smelly. Unappetising odor as you chew on the meat. Definitely overpriced for what you get.
