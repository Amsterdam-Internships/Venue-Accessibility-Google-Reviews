1,Rembrandt Corner, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Fantastic menu selection with lots of more traditional Dutch food as well as other typically European dishes. Everything is very reasonably priced as well. Service was also good.
2,Rembrandt Corner, 4 stars ,3 months ago,I have been there with my hubby and daughter and were were treated so well. The pancake was amazing and the club sandwich was incredible.  I told my parents to go there and they had a wonderful time. The staff is really welcoming and nice. ‚Ä¶
3,Rembrandt Corner, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Forgive me as I forgot to take photos of this Bistro.  Let me tell you the food is amazing and I heard nothing but praises from my friends at dinner as well.  The atmosphere is pleasant and very Amsterdamish (if that‚Äôs a word).

5,Rembrandt Corner, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is tasty, I had a british breakfast. Staff could be a bit more welcoming. First we waited for 5min until the waitress showed up, then we were told that we would have to move to another table if a group arrives."

11,Rembrandt Corner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Didn't try the food but they had nice selections of teas and tasty coffee. Very local atmosphere. Great place to stop by while exploring Amstedam and make yourself warm.
12,Rembrandt Corner, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good atmosphere and service but the food was overpriced for what it is. I paid 11 euros for a Nutella pancake and they gave me two Nutella packets and a can of powdered sugar. It's a bad sign when IHOP puts more effort into food than you.
13,Rembrandt Corner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pleasant, large cafe with canalside seating. Good food and service and nice beers. A little pricey, but not out of the ordinary."
14,Rembrandt Corner, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great location just next to Rembrandt house museum.  Regional favorites on the menu including stamppot and pancakes.  Also offerings for international travelers yearning for a taste of home - cheese burgers or fish and chips, among others. ‚Ä¶"

23,Rembrandt Corner, 5 stars ,a year ago,Stayed around for the corner for a week in February and visited this restaurant multiple times. The traditional Dutch Meatball was by far the best dish I had during my stay. The portions were large and the food itself was very delicious. I can't wait until my next visit.
24,Rembrandt Corner, 2 stars ,4 months ago,We asked the waitress for water 3 times but we are still waiting‚Ä¶ We paid the bill and are still waiting the change too..
25,Rembrandt Corner, 1 star ,6 months ago,We bought the nacho's for 7.70 very expensive. We got a smal can of nacho's that we could make at home much better. It's a total scam!

27,Rembrandt Corner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We‚Äôve lived in the area for a bit more than six years now. This place has really improved since we‚Äôve been here for the first time. The food is really decent for what it is, service is good, and the place is not expensive for Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
28,Rembrandt Corner, 5 stars ,a year ago,Super cute building with cozy inside and great outdoor patio seating on the canal. The old corner building has tons of character. It's located right next to Rembrandt's home museum. The menu is huge with lots of great sounding options- true ‚Ä¶

35,Rembrandt Corner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It was very quiet when we visited on Monday. In fact we were the only customers for a while. The service was excellent and it was nice to have a good chat with the waitresses. Our food was excellent- Stampot and Stoompotje. Also enjoyed the choice of beer. Trappe beer and Swinckels were enjoyed!!
36,Rembrandt Corner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, nice people, nice food. I very much enjoyed the burger I ate at the Rembrandt Corner at the nice terrace outside at the canal. The burger was amazing, it was even too much, because it came with fries too. It was tasty and looked ‚Ä¶"

38,Rembrandt Corner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was really nice there. Friendly staff, a pretty place to sit, even when it's cold, you can sit outside, because of heating. The best: You geht there traditional dutch food, what is really rare in Amsterdam!"
39,Rembrandt Corner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A great place to stop, eat, chat, have a drink or two.  Right on the canal, at a corner in the middle of it all, we sat outside underneath a canopy.  We loved our sandwiches and the service was  quick and on top of it.  Highly recommend."
40,Rembrandt Corner, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The service was bad. We waited for more than 10 minutes to be served despite trying to get the attention of one of the waiter and when one came she still took time to clean the not dirty and empty tables besides us before even taking our ‚Ä¶

51,Rembrandt Corner, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was good, apple pie and a separate order of ice cream for my husband, along  with  coffee & tea. The ‚Ç¨2.40 extra charge for 1 more cup of hot water for refilling the tea (same tea bag) was excessive. Nice place, nice people, but bad idea to charge for hot water."
52,Rembrandt Corner, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"My girlfriend and I were told to sit anywhere by the waiter (manager?), we went to sit at a four person table he told us we can't sit there as it would be easier for him to serve us at a two person table (there were plenty of free four ‚Ä¶"
53,Rembrandt Corner, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"An interesting spot to stop and take a rest, looking over the canal. The food and beverage list was average, the food itself was again average but that is to be expected in a small cafe on a tourist route. Nothing wrong with the place at all."
54,Rembrandt Corner, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ordered 2 half-chicken dishes, both of them turned out raw. Decided not to make a problem so I asked them to cook them some more. When it came back 10 minutes later it was still raw, so we munched mostly on our extra free fries. Now my girlfriend is ill and vomiting for a dinner that cost us 30 euro."

58,Rembrandt Corner, 1 star ,5 years ago,Horrible food and rude staff. I had the soup which was so watery and tasted like instant soup. My friend had a sandwich which tasted like it had come out of a packet. The meat was from a packet and so were the eggs. Couldn't even eat it and it wasn't cheap either. Worst meal I've had in Amsterdam by a long way.
59,Rembrandt Corner, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Had a great time here! I was looking for a place to eat before checking into my room, and had a big breakfast and some coffee. It's not some magical food or anything, but it hits the spot and was well worth the 17 euro total. Also the staff was just very nice!"
