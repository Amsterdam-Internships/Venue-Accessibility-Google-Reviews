0,Miu, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Exquisite high quality sushi and absolutely top notch service!! We eat sushi in all countries that we go to and we've even eaten it all over Tokyo and this was the closest comparison we've had. It's not your cheap over-filled rice style sushi. The tablet is easy to use and the atmosphere is relaxing and tranquil.
1,Miu, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Nice restaurant and atmosphere with good sushi. Is actually really all you can eat unlike some suggest. You order 5 dishes X 5 rounds and as long as you eat everything, you can get extra rounds. But to be honest, I can never eat more than 20 or so, there is more than enough food to enjoy!"
2,Miu, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Quality of the sushi is super, always fresh.
They serve your orders very very quickly. My best all you can eat place in Amsterdam."
3,Miu, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"This was our first time ever trying out a Japanese cuisine. Earlier we tried the dish and it was full of flavor wasabi. It works as follows
You can sit in the gezellig and nice ambience place if you make a reservation. …"
4,Miu, 5 stars ,a month ago,Miu is one of the best sushi places in Amsterdam. Their sushi tastes fresh and is very good. …
5,Miu, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,This place had a lot of potential but I will not be returning. The service wasnt very friendly and when I asked for tap water they refused (which is illegal). It was loud and busy and the sushi was just ok. We waited for a dish and the …
6,Miu, 5 stars ,8 months ago,It is a really good all-you-can-eat sushi place.
7,Miu, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent place and excellent atmosphere, but only one thing I am not happy because there say "" all you can eat"" but when inside they say the table has to order max. 30 order after that no-one can order anymore. It for me looks worse once they say "" all you can eat"""
8,Miu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What a experience. Food was on point. The fact you can have all you can eat and food beinf served at the table is really something. I liked the presentations. The flavours were coming through really nice and the atmosphere was relaxing. Loved the desserts and service as well.
9,Miu, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice place to eat sushi.
Been here twice now, experienced both times fairly good. …"
10,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best all you can eat Sushi Restaurants.
This Weekend i was there the 3rd time (I'm from  germany). Per Person you can order 5 things of the menue and you have about 2 hours to dine there. 2 hours are …"
11,Miu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good sushi,  nice ""all you can eat ""policy. You get five rounds of ordering,  but if you leave something uneaten on the.table., you have to pay for it. Food comes fast enough even on a busy night. Totally worth the money. 27euro per person for dinner on a week day."
12,Miu, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"This used to be a great restaurant, not anymore. The menu has been simplified to make it the same as the dozens of generic sushi places already existing in Amsterdam. The tables are closer than ever, separated by plastic screens which kills the vibe. This was the last time for me. Staff also rude and clearly untrained."
13,Miu, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Really good! Big portions, very delicious and small price. Thank you"
14,Miu, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"I love to eat there always, the place is clean,service good, and the staff are friendly......"
15,Miu, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best Asian all you can eat restaurant I’ve ever been to! The sushi also tasted really good, especially the ebi tempura roll and the sake nigiri. I’ve never seen such thick salmon slices on a nigiri in the Netherlands in an all you can eat …"
16,Miu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The ""all you can eat"" concept is awesome. You get five rounds with 6 dishes in each round which is more than enough (I could barely reach the 3rd one) for 25euros. …"
17,Miu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I really love this place. I have had dinner here many times and was never disappointed by the food. The employees are friendly and the dining room is beautifully decorated. The only thing that is not up to par is the toilet which is just …
18,Miu, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"This was my go to eating place when I studied in the netherlands.

Price, decor and deliciousness there really is no match. Superb."
19,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,In the heart of Amsterdam! Great food and great value for money. 30 € per person for 5 times 5 dishes. We were full at the 3rd round.
20,Miu, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Food was great in nice atmosphere. The only disappointment was the service, who ignore customers. We had to wait 45 min to get the tablet to order. After that everything was served smoothly with an amazing taste."
21,Miu, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Amazing place with amazing food. Everything was fresh and beautiful. The staff is perfect, always working hard to serve you. Special thanks to Karen, our waitress, always smiling and kind. We love everything.
We will be back there soon. 😋"
22,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really good quality of product. A few mistakes in the orders but overall very satisfying. Sushis are fresh and delicious. The variety of dishes makes it good place for small and big meals.
23,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Truly amazing food. The service is quick and easy with very helpful staff. The only down side is that drinks aren't included in the all you can eat price.
24,Miu, 5 stars ,a year ago,Went to Miu for the first time yesterday and had a really great experience. The price to quality was really good and the staff took great care of us. Also I really liked the gloomy atmosphere~ Would recommend!
25,Miu, 1 star ,a week ago,"Wow much has changed here. Whereas this was one of the best all you can eat sushi places, it has now boiled down to terrible customer service, flat-out rude, stinky toilets and mediocre food. It started with them giving our party with 3 …"
26,Miu, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"The food was poor and not tasty at all. Very cheap and very small dishes.
Many waitress didn't know English..."
27,Miu, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Perfect service!
I like the care with the food to take away.  Very tasty"
28,Miu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A bit over price and the tuna was a bit worst than before, bit for the rest the restaurant is still one of my favourites places to go and eat some sushi, now you can order with a tablet and is way more easy, good addition!"
29,Miu, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"One of my go to's for eating sushi with friends. The place has a nice and cosy vibe, and the food never disappoints !"
30,Miu, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Good service, decent quality food but very popular and busy. All you can eat with drinks deal is reasonable, but not cheap"
31,Miu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Don't go here by car cause it's right in the middle of the city only two minutes from Damsquare so it's crowded and plus parking is very expensive. …
32,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent Asian food in well decorated restaurant with very pleasent crew. And all that for normal price! Place to recommend in Amsterdam.
33,Miu, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Fabulous place. Comfortably one of the best sushi places in town. Everything tastes so fresh and well made. The meat menu is also so diverse and stunning. Anytime I want sushi or Asian food, I will be returning here.
An absolute must go if you’re a sushi/Asian food lover."
34,Miu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Food was really really  good.. staff was nice not overly crowded loved the setting tho
35,Miu, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Food, Quality, Price:
Wide selection of an all-you-can-eat sushi and grill place. Also lots of gluten-free options (with GF soy available). Everything was good and fresh. …"
36,Miu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Expensive. They don't serve water, you have to buy expensive 20cl drinks.

Food was great though. Buffet that gets served to your table. You have 5 rounds …"
37,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is super good located, behind Dam square. The formula all you can eat is good, there is also a all you can drink for 9.90€ more, and if you are a group I really suggest that. The sushi is good compared with other all you can eat. …"
38,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was a good experience overall, the food was delicious and the service was excellent! I would highly recommend this place to everyone who visits Amsterdam."
39,Miu, 1 star ,a year ago,"Apparently, we were allowed to sit only for 2 hours, starting from the very moment we entered and ending the one we left the door --all with no proper notice at all. The quality is not worth paying 40 eur all included for ordering two three …"
40,Miu, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"We had reservations 20.00 and they let us in 20.30.. very rude and bad service!
3 stars only for the food because it was very good!!"
41,Miu, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"In 2 hours you can eat and drink , the food is just amazing"
42,Miu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best all you can eat sushi places where Ive been. Also some really unique dishes like buns and spicey salmon (really fishy, not good). One star retracted for the waitresses, the one who showed us our table was really nice but the …"
43,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was the best Asian I'd ever had. The food was very fresh,  made to order and delicious. …"
44,Miu, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Unlike some other sushi restaurants where you have to gorge yourself within 2 hours, the restaurant provides a calm and ambient environment to eat for as long as you'd like. The staff is quick and professional, and they don't seem to waste …"
45,Miu, 4 stars ,7 months ago,The personal was so nice. But they had to do things according to some guidelines and this puts pressure on the clients and them...
46,Miu, 1 star ,3 years ago,"WORST service ever for the price of 33 euros/person !!!
1. They didn't serve all the meals we ordered (we had to wait very long between every dish) and they told us that the time was up so we had to leave (you can …"
47,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice all-you-can-eat concept: You order in rounds of 10 pieces max per round. This is their approach to avoid foodwaste. Cosy atmosphere, probably not a family place but perfect for a date or a round with friends. Food was delicious and came very quickly."
48,Miu, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"This is one of my favorite Asian restaurant in Amsterdam.

Not only is their super good but they also have other dishes for people who …"
49,Miu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"All you can eat sushi restaurant. Most of the sushi is pretty good, I especially like the tempura shrimp sushi and the salmon california roll. They also have non-sushi things like pork ribs, chicken and duck dishes which are included in the …"
50,Miu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Not bad. Typical all u can eat but some little gem plates to be tried. Eel sushi was a good start. Chilli king shrimp was good too. Tempura shrimp was lovely but undercooked tempura. Duck was always dry with plates. Overall not bad to be honest. A little pricey but plenty of choice. Rating 3
51,Miu, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very friendly staff and food comes super quickly! Some of the salads were a bit bland but overall the sushi is very good, just wish they didn't use the mayo-based sauces in these quantities. Great location as well."
52,Miu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is from a good quality and the service very rapid. I was with a group of people and we're located at the table with a U-shaped couch. These were not very comfortable, because the table was a bit too high, forcing you to sit extremely upright to eat. Other than that it was a nice restaurant."
53,Miu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Got recommended this place by a colleague. Was pleasantly suprised. Much larger inside than expected, service decent and they had menu items on the all you can eat list that other all you can eat sushi places don't have. Liked the variety."
54,Miu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Ate here yesterday for the first time, and I do not regret it! So much better than Sumo and Shabu Shabu where I used to eat. They got a nice variery of sushi and other dishes! …"
55,Miu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good variety of sushi, which was nice, but the quality of non-sushi items wasn't the best, and the flavors were a little muted. Chicken was cooked in a very unappetizing way and fried stuff was mostly refried into oily flavorless blocks. Don't get the potato fries, potato cake or the roasted chicken."
56,Miu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very dark, it took time to get comfortable and get used to the ambience.
We went for all you can eat lunch and it was satisfying although I've  had better experiences. Good but not my first choice for sushi."
57,Miu, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere, excellent japanese food. All you can eat -lunch was great. (19,95€/person) Best sushi I've eaten. But I suggest not to order something you are not sure of. You can't order another round before you have eaten everything …"
58,Miu, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We were 17 people, of which only one didn't want to order all you can eat sushi. They categorically refused to have that happen without the person being moved to another table. …"
59,Miu, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Just a bit pricey, but worth it occasionally. Good food, good service and nice atmosphere!"
60,Miu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"fine sushi, very expensive.
must order unlimited dish for the whole table and you have to pay extra for each roll you don't finish. …"
61,Miu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food quality. Would love if the music would be a bit louder but that's fine. And big thanks for Jordy who was the main server of our table. Super professional, atentive and polite. This guy definitely deserves a raise, service was …"
62,Miu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I have eaten at lots of all you can eat sushi places through Amsterdam, so far this beats Sumo, Shabu Shabu and Mojo Or Genki. The quality of the sushi is far better than those. of course not perfect as it is an all you can eat but in that …"
63,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Honestly.. best all you can eat ive been to, everrrrr!
Place looks great, personel is friendly, service is fast, and the food is all kinds of good!! …"
64,Miu, 1 star ,7 years ago,"Good location, nice food, but very bad service!
One of us wanted ""a la carte"", the other ""all you can eat"". Outdoors they advertise both. The manager (!!) told us after drinks were served to leave the …"
65,Miu, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"cute restaurant especially for date night, great service/friendly staff, and cool all-you-can eat concept.  sushi selections were somewhat limited but quality was good and the other options (kind of like asian tapas?) were delicious and worth trying."
66,Miu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A bit too dark, but that makes it cozy.
All you can eat concept (5 rounds x 5 items) Crispy chicken is very nice.
Toilets had a floater,. not sure how often staff checks those but that was pretty nasty."
67,Miu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Normal all you can eat sushi fusion restaurant where one can order 5 rounds. In rach round, 5 items on the menu can be ordered. However, sashimi is not included in the all you can eat menu, and you will need to pay extra. The service is …"
68,Miu, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Liked the concept of never ending Japanese ""fine dining"" menu. You select couple of portions per ""Round"" and after you've eaten the foods of current round you can order next one until you are full. But do not leave anything on your plate as they might charge you for ordering so much that you cant eat the rest."
69,Miu, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Cosy place with softened light which creates the ILLUSION of an intimate atmosphere. The staff is actually pretty unfriendly and intrusive. The menu is poor, not lots of choice (only salmon sushi for example, no shrimp/avocado/squid/crab …"
70,Miu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Been to amsterdam 3 times, the first time my BF and I stumbled across this place from trip advisor... needless to say we reserve a table every time we visit! (Making that 3) Staff are friendly, food is fresh, plenty of options to eat (till you drop!) And will continue to eat here forever! 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾"
71,Miu, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Best all-you-can-eat Sushi in Amsterdam. Bit pricey tho
72,Miu, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Thieves. 12 of us in a party, ordering 40 euro set menu inc free drinks. When the bill arrived, it turns out they charged us for 13 ppl, and not only that-  they charged the 30 menu (which doesnt include drinks) and they added all the …"
73,Miu, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Went in an hour before close and the staff were rude from the very beginning. Took several minutes to be seated because none of the staff wanted to attend us. The food itself cannot be faulted and arrived very quickly. We were gone well before close.
74,Miu, 4 stars ,a year ago,Been to this place twice & still love their food. Staffs are helpful & friendly. Foods were prepared fresh & fast served.
75,Miu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good sushi. Very delicious. Had all you can eat. You can have 5 items per person and 5 rounds. We almost could eat everything.
76,Miu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The sushi from the all you can eat menu was good and arrived promptly. Ordering drinks was a bit more difficult, as no one ever came to ask and flagging down someone could be tricky."
77,Miu, 1 star ,4 years ago,"the service is extremely bad. We didn't order drinks in the beginning and were considering order later and the waiter even came to remind us very rudely that they have the rule that guests are obliged order drinks, what kind of rule it is?! This ruined our dinner which we would like to enjoy.  won't recommend it"
78,Miu, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I don't understand why there are maki rolls with goat cheese. I don't know about other ppl's tastes, but for myself I wouldn't call it sushi and will never come back again. 2 stars for the atmosphere but obviously it suits better as a cafe …"
79,Miu, 1 star ,4 years ago,This is not ALL YOU CAN EAT! I do not order something you don't like as the staff will treat you as children and tell you off as well as charge you even more. The cost of the meal in the evening is extremely over priced first what you have …
80,Miu, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Diner is good, but the lunch menu is so small. Like one fourth of the normal menu. The price is just 7 euros cheaper. It should be at least half price since the choice is less than poor... …"
81,Miu, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice atmosphere. But a little bit on the high prices
82,Miu, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice restaurant in the city center. Each food item on the card has an information whether it contains gluten, ... Price is fair. I recommend to book a table even during the week"
83,Miu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I wish I would've known what was this place about before coming because not knowing how it work affected my experience, it was definitely a lot of food on the fix price. The place is looking really nice inside, there's a nice ambient and …"
84,Miu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing sushi and a variety of other foods to choose from. Service may look chaotic but it works just fine. I do recommend calling in advance for a spot as it can be very busy.
85,Miu, 1 star ,2 years ago,"THEY HATE FAMILIES
I had an appointment with friends in the restaurant and I arrived when they were already there, I was with my baby and upon entry the waiter told me ""this"" …"
86,Miu, 5 stars ,a month ago,Lovely cozy amazing place
87,Miu, 1 star ,6 years ago,I have been to many all you can eat places but I never have been to one that charges 2 euros for every leftover. The worst part was the cockroach crawling up our table. I couldn't eat after that. Would not recommend it.
88,Miu, 1 star ,3 years ago,We komen binnen om 17:25 en vroeger of de actie early bird nog geldig is. De ober zei Ja. Toen we bij de Balie kwamen zie de mevrouw dat ze vol waren terwijl er nog heleboel tafels vrij waren beneden en boven. Erg vreemd. …
89,Miu, 1 star ,4 years ago,The service is the worst ever! I ordered with my friends a dessert 20 to 10. They said they are closing the kitchen at 10. I'm like okay it's fine. The guy after I asked for dessert said that maybe he didn't see it and now it's too late …
90,Miu, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very nice and polite staff. Food was good for the price we paid. Nice selection of drinks for the all in price.
91,Miu, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Lovely atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious food! I love the variety offered and everything I've tried has been just perfect. Have had many good evenings in this restaurant."
92,Miu, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"The food was really nice presented, very generous portions and a funny Asian staff. The beers very tasty we took the Chinese and the Japanese.. The all you can eat promo is a must."
93,Miu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really delicious food, journey into Asian taste. Highly recommended when you're in Amsterdam and looking for unlimited, fresh and tasty food. Crew was really friendly, thank you very much! :)"
94,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great sushi, one of my favorites"
95,Miu, 1 star ,5 years ago,"TOURIST TRAP. They recently changed the all-you-can-eat lunch menu, and now is very very poor. The food is ok though. But there are better and cheaper sushi places in Amsterdam."
96,Miu, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Single guy brown skin sporting a goatee dressed in a suit .. refused a table saying they are fully booked when there were at least 20 + empty tables , called to reserve but no answer! If they tell me that all tables are going to be filled up in the next 15 mins .. they have to be giving away free food .. racist much?"
97,Miu, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Probably the best all you can eat sushi restaurant in Amsterdam!! The atmosphere is very cosy the staff is very professional and friendly!! The food is always perfect and tasty! This is our 5th time here and we will come back again for sure!
98,Miu, 1 star ,4 years ago,I wanted to order a la carte instead of the very expensive all you can eat. They didn't let me do it! We were 30 and bringing a lot of money. They have no respect and you cannot have tap water. We even talk with the manager.
99,Miu, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Really bad restaurant. Do not come here. We were like 30 people and one of us was sick, they didn't allow him to order only white rice for him without the all you can eat. He could be there however without ordering anything. It just doesn't make any sense. Really unreasonable, unflexible and rude service"
100,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent and very tasty fresh sushi.  Great service and very good value too. Loved it all.
101,Miu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Lunch menu is a bit small. No tap water served despite them having a tap and glass wear. Friendly enough staff. Looks pretty nice inside.
102,Miu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Above average all-you-can-eat Asian fusion restaurant. Good value for money, a lot of tasty food. Been here multiple times and was never disappointed."
103,Miu, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"It's an ok place. The all you can eat is crazy! You get plenty of food, quality is normal, obviously... Environment ok, good for groups, music was a little weird for eating sushi..."
104,Miu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice restaurant with delicious food and great prices.
105,Miu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A little pricey BUT I loved the food that I even went twice there during my holiday in Amsterdam. They definitely not made profit from me as I stocked up and left the place barely able to walk. Will definitely visit again whenever I am in Amsterdam.
106,Miu, 5 stars ,7 years ago,tried this for first time with a friend visiting from paris. much better than regular sushi place tastewise . perhaps relatively unknown but that makes it more peaceful and comfy. beautiful interiors. recommended.
107,Miu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fast, efficient service and good (although fairly standard) menu choices. Would certainly visit again, as sushi was good quality."
108,Miu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good selection of Asian food. It is pretty fancy as an all-you-can-eat. Make reservation. Just some food is a little bit salty.
109,Miu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It is all you can eat, so our expect of the Japanese food is not high. However, the salad, suishi and some maybe Chinese dishes are all good to eat."
110,Miu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Fairly ok not cheap and if you order something what is you get bigger portions which you have to Finnish or it will be added to the bill
111,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food and service.
112,Miu, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible service, not very nice atmosphere and very expensive. I wanted a salmon salad and all I got was three small slices of salmond on one saladleaf. Really dissapointed!"
113,Miu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great sea food and sushi. They offer a big variety of sea food and drinks. Although it's pretty expensive, but worth it. The toilets are okay."
114,Miu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great food at fair prices! My only issue is that the staff get very rude when you ask if your party can pay separately.
115,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best sushi I had so far! Really nice location and friendly staff :)
116,Miu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,best all you can eat Asian fusion restaurant in Amsterdam
117,Miu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"sushi is great,  they make it once you order and the setting is beautiful inside. I try to go everytime I'm in Amsterdam!"

122,Miu, 4 stars ,6 years ago,The food was so delicious even though i had not eaten sushi before.The price was pleasurable compared to other all you can eat sushi restaurants also the menu does not include only japanese cuisine.Service was ok.Only one thing i didn't …
123,Miu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Every dish we ordered is great, nothing to complain except they started to serve slowly after 3 rounds, but"
124,Miu, 1 star ,4 years ago,Tourist trap. Sushi rice tastes like glu. Spicy tuna uses pepper powder. Crab fried like sticks. Overpriced.
125,Miu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A slightly wider choice than ordinary sushi places.
The owner seems to have an astonishingly strong love for pop music from last decade though."
126,Miu, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The place looks nice but the taste dishes doesn't match the decor.
Close to the Dam. Not too many foot traffic passing to keep it calm."
127,Miu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice ambiance, good food, ample choice on the all you can eat menu, friendly staff, decent prices."
128,Miu, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food - really fresh sushi! And 5 rounds each is more than enough, don't know why everyone else was complaining so much!"
129,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Yummmmmmy got to come back to this place again. Great food and good quality. I could just keep eating very dangerous haha
130,Miu, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good quality food with friendly staff. I just wish they accepted to serve tap water, especially when we also order a bottle of wine."
131,Miu, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Good quality (had better) and quite expensive.
Staff really tries to rush service."
132,Miu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really great location, ambiance, system and food. But service is not always friendly, especially just before closing hour."
133,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best sushi I ever eaten!! All you can eat restaurant, clean, fresh, delicious food!"

141,Miu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice all you can eat sushi restaurant . Food quality is good.
142,Miu, 1 star ,5 years ago,Food is fairly good but horrible service! You get rushed and just ignored when you're talking to them about anything
143,Miu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very first taste of this Japanese style of multiple choice menu unusual but enjoyed it.
