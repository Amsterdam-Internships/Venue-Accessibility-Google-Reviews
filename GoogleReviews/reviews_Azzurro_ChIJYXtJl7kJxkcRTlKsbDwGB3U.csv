1,Azzurro, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Prison spaghetti tastes better!! We ordered calamari starter, minestrone soup, and spaghetti aglio i olio al pollo.  The calamari seemed to be reconstituted from paste and deep-fried in very old oil.  Served on a Square of kitchen roll with ‚Ä¶"
2,Azzurro, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Very very nice waiter with a mustache and food 4/5. I recommended this place. Prices not high.
3,Azzurro, 1 star ,2 years ago,"My friend had the special steak offer for 12.90 but it turned out that it was rather chewy. They don‚Äôt serve you tap water when you have 2 Beer and 2 main courses. It seems that they are very needy for extra 2,30 Euro which is a bit stingy. 1 Glas Dirty, good Heineken beer and I had an ok Spagetti Gorgonzola"

12,Azzurro, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Really not impressed by the food. I order a calzone and it was really simple and didn't feel enough cook. The onion and peper where hard and cold. You can't have tap water you need to order a bottle.
13,Azzurro, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was okay, not nice, not rude. The food however is not Italian in any way. Hell, it‚Äôs not even remotely resembles anything Italian. The pasta was so overcooked it was basically a puree. The tomato sauce was the cheapest you could ‚Ä¶"
