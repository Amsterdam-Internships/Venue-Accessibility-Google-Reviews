0,Subway, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Good place for sandwich. You are able able to take away either it in place.
Nothing different from others Subways.
Place was clean and fast service as well."
1,Subway, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice employees, and good food. I think most of the staff only speaks English but that‚Äôs fine."
2,Subway, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Very good place. The upstairs dine in area is very cozy. You can enjoy the food as well as the the street view from there. Coming to the food, it's very good as well. Good menu. The shop keepers speak English. The restroom is free for customers."
3,Subway, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,"Food is fine, the guy that works there is rude and yells at the customers."
4,Subway, 4 stars ,3 years ago,It's a calm subway. It's decently sized and the staff was nice. I'd come back to this subway any time instead of the smaller ones.
5,Subway, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Service is bad, they are not friendly and being rude. Paid ‚Ç¨2.75 just for a bottle water."

17,Subway, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Got good and fast service, food was great"
18,Subway, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Sandwiches are pretty good. The place itself, or this Subway, was somewhat dirty, in my opinion.  There were some fruit flies ""camping"" on the wall of the seating area when I was there. The staff wore gloves when making the sandwiches and the fridge where they kept the toppings were clean, though."
19,Subway, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You will find the standard Subway, food is great for a quick bite. There is veggie option as well. It is right outside the Rokin station and hence, you can get a quick grab before you head into the main street. Of course, there are great food options at the Dam square but a snack is always ok."
20,Subway, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst subway I‚Äôve ever been all over the cities I have visited, one of the waiter is very very rude and makes me feels like he is racist. The sandwiches he made for me just wore than any other subway in Amsterdam. What a brilliant attitude and service. Deserves zero star."
21,Subway, 1 star ,5 years ago,"One of the worst Subways I have been to. For one simple reason: we paid for a drink so that we are able to go to the bathroom (a reasonable exchange), but they wouldn't let us go! They also didn't allow us a refund for a purchase made a second ago. Terrible restaurant with very rude workers and manager. Do not go."
22,Subway, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Holy s... As an subway employee myself, I know the standarts at subway, like how to make a perfect sub or how to talk to guests. Couldn‚Äôt find any of that here. Workers were really unfriendly, better don‚Äôt ask something, they will just roll ‚Ä¶"
23,Subway, 5 stars ,a year ago,Fine and tasty food üçï all are fresh. Served at the proper time and well behaved.
24,Subway, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Like at any Subway I love how you can make your sandwich as healthy or unhealthy as you decide. There is limitless freedom in creating the sub that suits best to your taste and cravings.
25,Subway, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The sandwich was good, nothing particularly special, the price are really cheaper than the restaurant in the streets near it, I suggest it if you are hungry and want to pay low price.

27,Subway, 1 star ,4 years ago,As soon as we came in the manager sent us to order without giving us a chance to decide. The girl was also rushing us to order even though there was no other customers. I ordered a sandwich from the menu but then she was asking me what ‚Ä¶
