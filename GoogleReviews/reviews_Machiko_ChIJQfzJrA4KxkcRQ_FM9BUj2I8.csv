21,Machiko, 1 star ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Sushi was not fresh, weird sauces on it, hard wasabi, not at all what I expected. I went back after 5 minutes to ask for my money back. Staff was calling employer where I was at and talked about insulting me against ‚Ä¶"
22,Machiko, 1 star ,3 years ago,(Translated by Google) Just ordered 2 wok and sushi in an in / outrol tuna. We were a bit surprised that we had to pay separately for all vegetables and meat / chicken / fish. The vegetable is relatively expensive. In the kapsalon ‚Ä¶
