15,Caf√© Van Puffelen, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I don't really like giving single star reviews, but when management consciously decides to offer a terrible service. It deserves this. The place was totally understaffed or overbooked. We had to wait an hour for our starter and another hour ‚Ä¶"

26,Caf√© Van Puffelen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a great place with fantastic food.  It is like two separate places with a casual bar with cafe food on one side and finer dining on the other.

27,Caf√© Van Puffelen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"To be honest, food is plain fare, but reliably tasty. But it's atmosphere! It's the place for celebrations with three generations, and full of happy memories. A great place to go with kids and grandparents, or a group of friends or colleagues, not so much a romantic dinner for two."

34,Caf√© Van Puffelen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Average food and they completely missed a confirmed reservation we made for 10 persons (arguing that they had emailed us about being full but could not show us that email).
