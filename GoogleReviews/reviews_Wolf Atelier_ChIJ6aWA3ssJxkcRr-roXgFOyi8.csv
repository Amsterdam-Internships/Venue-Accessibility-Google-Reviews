1,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,8 months ago,We had a very nice evening at Restaurant Wolf Atelier. The location is unique (built on an old railway bridge) with nice views. The 15-course tasting menu was very tasty and well worth the money. We went with 4 staff-suggested wines during the evening and didn't regret it. Worth a visit when you are visiting Amsterdam.
2,Wolf Atelier, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"The staff, location, restaurant fit out and presentation of the plates were really lovely (4 stars) and I wish I could say the same for the food however each dish (except the dessert which was tasty) were really lacking any note-worthy ‚Ä¶"

7,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"What a great experience! We did the 15 courses, it was delicious. So much taste, detail and love in every plate. And if you have an allergy you are vegetarian, they are so helpful ‚Ä¶"
8,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One thing first: location: surprising/awesome.Surrounded by water next to central station - a jewel. We choose al√° carte today (coming back for the 15 courses taste menu though) and it was amazing. You want to go for  fancy food but don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶

10,Wolf Atelier, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"We have a mixed experience here. We ordered 5 courses. The food was delicious and the plates were creative but the portions way too small by most standards. The portions are false economy, its a wrong way of saving money. The service was ‚Ä¶"

12,Wolf Atelier, 2 stars ,2 years ago,An absolute roller-coaster of an experience. We came for one of the inventive fine dining + dance music events during ADE and the the night was riddled with miscommunication and hostile staff. ‚Ä¶
13,Wolf Atelier, 4 stars ,a year ago,What a nice place ! Located at a former industrial swing bridge we had a 15 (!) courses dinner and each small portion was a delight!
14,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really excellent. I ate there with some friends for a special occasion. We had the 5 course menu and it was absolutely delicious. The kitchen was also kind enough to allow us to substitute some items which my wife was unable to eat with ‚Ä¶

18,Wolf Atelier, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place has a great location. The lighting of the restaurant is perfect. We loved the welcome box! The food is good, but it took over two hours to serve the four-course menu. We had to wait very long between the dishes. We eventually left ‚Ä¶"
19,Wolf Atelier, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was really amazing, although for a 5 course menu it took almost 3 hours of preparation. Dishes could be slightly bigger as well"

25,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great restaurant, I love to seeing the chef‚Äôs working magic."
26,Wolf Atelier, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Interesting menu but don't go here if you have dietary requirements - very disappointing. They just took out the main ingredient and served more of the garnish. Staff got very defensive when asked about it. So service wasn't that great either.

32,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Fantastic experience, great service and excellent taste"

38,Wolf Atelier, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We had the 15 course dinner, with recommend wines. 4 of the dishes were really good, and 4 were actually not pleasant (lacking flavor). The rest was average. The service was lacking: the first course took 45-60 minutes. They forgot about ‚Ä¶"
39,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had never heard about this restaurant and it actually took me a while to find it. The design is very interesting, it is actually a former bridge - I love when old constructions get a second life. Lots of small surprises like the water bottle which you get in a box with the menu. Good dishes and very informal setting."
40,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Truly delicious food and very good service. You definitely go there to spend quite some time. The dishes are small and served beautifully with wine pairing. I would highly recommend it for a business or a romantic dinner for two.
41,Wolf Atelier, 2 stars ,9 months ago,Drinks were good and pricey but service poor and there was hardly anyone out on the terrace. Four young waiters busy talking to each other behind the counter
42,Wolf Atelier, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We were very much looking forward to it, but the dinner was nothing short of a disaster. The service was the worst I've experienced in Amsterdam, and our request to accommodate our need to leave early for a show received a nod, but zero ‚Ä¶"

47,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had the 15 course tasting / starter menu, with which you get you sample 15 different dishes ranging from appetizers, mains, desserts and anything in between. And this is a very pleasant sensation for your taste buds, now I know that ‚Ä¶"
48,Wolf Atelier, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The starter was okay and the main dish was good. The wines were decent. However, the price/ratio was off and that turned the general impression to a bit pretentious."
49,Wolf Atelier, 2 stars ,6 years ago,Great hostess. Slow service. Not very inspiring food. Small dishes. We had to order extra bread to feel full after 5 courses. We had someone who didn't eat fish and someone who couldn't eat raw food. Replacement was uninspiring. There weren't any vegetarians but no vegetarian options on the menu.
50,Wolf Atelier, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was fine. But we waited way too long for it to be served and it wasn't even busy. We had a two course lunch and it took approximately two hours. And when we asked for some more bread while waiting for our dishes, they forgot to bring it, we had to ask for it three times."
51,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,a year ago,We had the 15 courses menu with wine pairing and it was excellent. The service is very personal and the ambiance is very cozy but modern. Totally recommend it.
52,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My wife is from Holland and this is my second time to Amsterdam.  We live in San Francisco and love the food scene.  We made reservations last night to celebrate my sister and brother in-law‚Äôs 36th Anniversary.  Every plate beautifully ‚Ä¶

56,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Extraordinary place. All dishes made with a lot of passion, details and flavours. They really take care of everyone at their restaurant. It is worth having dinner there if you come to Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
57,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As exciting for its location as its food: this dockland-esque structure floating above the water is ideal for meals on the smarter side of casual. Despite a perhaps slightly too polished experience at times, the service and dishes shine through nonetheless."
58,Wolf Atelier, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Super interesting and tasty 15 course Muse meal. Service and ambience was great. Wine pairing / selection was okay, but not excellent. Only thing from preventing a 5 Star."
59,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Simply amazing. Would love to visit again
60,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A bit expensive considering small portions, but all is very good and out of the line of classic. You can enjoy some finesse food discoveries here. And don't forget you're eating on top of a rotating bridge for trains!"
61,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect location on top of a mobile Bridge. Looks just perfect from the inside and outside. Food is really good, with the option to chose a la carte or from a menu with 15 servings. Would really recommend"

65,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Wolf atelier is an amazing find. The location is away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre but close enough for a romantic stroll. One there you get a great view of the harbour. Inside the restaurant has an excellent t atmaospher ‚Ä¶

71,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Incredibly wonderful. We visited Wolf as it is on an old railway bridge and quite an unusual setting, high above the canal. A lovely cool breeze welcomed us as Michael Wolf himself greeted us with charm. The food is incredibly flavoursome. ‚Ä¶"
72,Wolf Atelier, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good though slightly pricey food, nice wine parinings also available per half glass. Staff was friendly but seemed a bit rushed and distracted at times."

77,Wolf Atelier, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A lot of time and thought went into this menu, the flavours all worked well together. What let it down was a 20 minute wait between courses in the middle, due to increased numbers in the restaurant."
78,Wolf Atelier, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The kitchen chef, who comes from Vorarlberg, Austria, makes his best effort to create quality dishes with modern charm. We enjoyed their dessert the most throughout 15 course journey of his inspiration."

80,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had the amazing 15 course tasting menu. Great service in a relaxed atmosphere!
81,Wolf Atelier, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It‚Äôs all about price/quality ratio. The place and food is good itself but not excellent therefore really overpriced. There are many places with better food, service and atmosphere where you don‚Äôt need to pay that much."
82,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The place looks really great and the service is amazing. I chose the 5 course menu, didn't like every meal, but that's just a matter of taste I guess."

90,Wolf Atelier, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food. They lost (someone steal) our umbrella, left us with a very bitter taste. Below our expectations for this restaurant."
91,Wolf Atelier, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Wolf has a good setting and intention but lacks in service and attitude. Michaels vision and drive is not portrayed by his serving staff who lack experience. This is evident by not knowing how to open or serve wine, explain dishes and being presentable to the level expected. A shame."
92,Wolf Atelier, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The service is perfect, accommodating but not fussy. The food here is beautiful,  with a special presence of fresh herbs.  Really nice vibe. I'd go back."
