0,Heffer, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The location is very pleasant and well furnished.
Ribs were incradibly tasty and soft, i recommand them!
The service wasn't good as well, the waitress left the menu on the table and I ate on it, even though the table was quite little for the amount of food."
1,Heffer, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A nice place to have a meal. Good service and cozy atmosphere. In the picture: nachos, BLTC and tune melt. These are the very best nachos that I have never tried!"
2,Heffer, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice environment, a classic wooden, brass and glass bar. Narrow rectangular dishes on narrow rectangular tables made it a little tricky to keep the plates on the tables. Love the tiny mayonnaise jar for the fries."
3,Heffer, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The Escape Room is amazing! First time I've been there with some friends and was a great experience! Recommend this experience to any group looking to experience a thrill and testing puzzles. We were well looked after in the pub afterwards as well!
4,Heffer, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place with amazing service, free wifi, reasonable prices!"
5,Heffer, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I was there and I saw an amazing girl but I couldn't talk to her I hope to see her again and I will never leave her
6,Heffer, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, but takes ages to get food and a bit pricey."
7,Heffer, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice bar in the centre, close to the main harbour. Lovely decoration with a really cool mezzanine where you can sit and look down into the bar area, or gaze into the street and watch the world go by. Also has a nice external seating …"
8,Heffer, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty comfy place with cheerful servive. They could do with some more ciders though. Lots of sport playing, no supprise for a sports bar 😉"
9,Heffer, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I had been there on my last trip to Amsterdam a few years ago and I had loved the atmosphere, decor and food, so I naturally wanted to go back. I was utterly disappointed. Only the bar area looked kind of like it had, the rest of it was …"
10,Heffer, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice cafe! an old taxes office which has been beautifully transformed into a cafe. Unfortunately Italian and Spanish tourist guides have made it their stop along their route, and it can get very loud inside, but still worthy!"
11,Heffer, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Large bar with expansive outdoor seating right at the entrance to the Red Light District in central Amsterdam. While their beer selections are respectable, the prices are rather high. However that is expected given the location. The prime …"
12,Heffer, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Bad food and poorly served, the food is overpriced, they asked me if I wanted fries with the burger, I said I don't, and they still brought it and made me pay for it (4€!!!!!! For a portion of fries). The staff seemed to not care about us …"
13,Heffer, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A satisfactory option right next to the riverside. We had dinner in this place and we were happy to see large portions of well cooked and tasty food. Also, the staff was polite and the environment inside was agreeable with good music."
14,Heffer, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Food absolutely 10/10. We had the Beef Carpaccio and Goat's Cheese salad. Service was slow, but friendly. We were in no rush so it was just relaxed. Besides, we had an interesting view of a party bursting out from the room next to the toilets to keep us occupied!"
15,Heffer, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Went here for the show nothing wrong with the venue. Quite busy and fun. Owners of the magic mike show done a very poor job of accommodating the show and choosing the an awful venue with a stage a size of a single bed
16,Heffer, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing burger and hutspot and possibly the cleanest toilets in Amsterdam.  Will return tomorrow
17,Heffer, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I went there with my family to have a few beers and lunch.  The waitress was completely uninterested in serving us, and didn't see her again.  After our meal and one beer, I went up to the bar to pay.  Better than dealing with the waitress.  Will never go there again."
18,Heffer, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice place! Service is lovely and price is ok
19,Heffer, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"was a bit scared by the reviews but tried out anyway because they have kind of an alt beer, which is from my region. the inside is nice, the staff was good and the food nice as well. as with most places close to touristic areas in adam, prolly better when you do not go there on the busy weekends"
20,Heffer, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was the only place in the center to offer us food at around 4.30 pm when all kitchens (in proper restaurants) were closed. The ambiance inside is nice with old Dutch paintings and the service is efficient and friendly, and in English."
21,Heffer, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Really bad and slow service. We went, my friends and I, for lunch. Half of the people had been served while the other half waited for their dish. We waited for more than 50 minutes, unfortunatly my friends were done by this time. We told …"
22,Heffer, 1 star ,8 months ago,Worst worst place... i have been here waited more than 1 hour.... the food delivery is so so slow
23,Heffer, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I had a burger and a Coke.
The Coke was like brown water, really still and they had to switch it 3 times, before a guy went over the street to buy a real coke. …"
24,Heffer, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The staff is really rude, the toilets are the dirtiest I've seen in Amsterdam. The staff being rude was why this place gets only two stars. The staff rather hangs out with friends instead of helping you with a smile. Won't come here again."
25,Heffer, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We enjoyed our visit this typical Amsterdam cafe, with a cool glass of Heineken. The prices were a bit high, but it is on the centre after all. Staff was friendly and helpful."
26,Heffer, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I stopped off here for an end of night drink as part of a stag group in 2017, shortly after visiting the red-light district. Probably one of the more trust-worthy establishments in the area and very inviting inside."
27,Heffer, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good place to watch sports! Prices for drinks are normal and the food tastes good also. Will be watching many games there in the future!
28,Heffer, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Never have I ever eaten a burger this bad! We had to wait for hours for our drinks and they were super expensive as well! This café is the worst, it's true ;)"
29,Heffer, 1 star ,4 years ago,Overpriced student sports bar and cafe. A true waste of time and money. Any sports bar in Amsterdam  is better than this one. A poor attempt to rescue a drowning dog.

38,Heffer, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"One of the worst place in Amsterdam. I had a pasta and it was overcooked and drenched in oil, when I asked for a coffee the guy just took away my beer even if it was half dranked. Awful"
39,Heffer, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"I just popped in for a coffee so I don't have too much experience but overall the coffee was just what I needed. However, the price was not paid entirely too much for a tiny coffee."
40,Heffer, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Really poor food, expensive burger that looked and tasted like old meatloaf. Undercooked soggy fries, and toilets that were very dirty and tiny."
41,Heffer, 1 star ,4 years ago,Ignored at the bar when there were only a few people actually sitting there. Looked like the tables were getting well serviced. I left
