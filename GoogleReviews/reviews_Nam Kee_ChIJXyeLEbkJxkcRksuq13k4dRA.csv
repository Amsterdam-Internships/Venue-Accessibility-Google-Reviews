0,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Amazing Chinese foods! Tasty peeking duck that you have to try! Big portion and quite quick service, the drinks just fridge drink nothing special"
1,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Very large portion for a cheap price, and it was very good and authentic.
It's in the heart of Chinatown, near the Red Light District.
If you want to taste a piece of China in Amsterdam, go here. …"
2,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,a month ago,"This restaurant is legendary in the capital and has been in business (at the same location) for over 40 years. I've been disappointed several times in the past (partly because I'm #1 Wing Kee fan, a few door away) but today's visit was most …"
3,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,5 months ago,An average chinese restaurant. My dish was very plain. Should have added spices. Try to add some flavour by tossing chili sauce into my noodles but still. I wouldn't recommend this place as I m pretty sure that it is not hard to find a better place which beats this one easily.
4,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Decided to give Nam Kee a try again after a long while. Last time was at New King after corona and was disappointed with the food and their Chinese tea (which we paid for). I had the Peking duck noodles soup for lunch and enjoyed the roast duck meat. Noodles was not much but a lot of meat. Tea was complimentary and actually tasted good!
5,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"After a couple weeks of traveling, I was starting to feel fatigued and needed a pick me up. When I’m home, wonton soup is my go to and Nam Kee hit the mark. The food was delicious and affordable. The restaurant was busy when we were there …"
6,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Started my Euro trip in Amsterdam and I was craving for some Chinese food and a friend told me about this spot when she came to Amsterdam. Located in Chinatown next to RLD. Got a simple three treasure rice and some green tea. It was good …
7,Nam Kee, 1 star ,a month ago,Food is generally good. DO NOT get the egg omelette or fuyunghai if you don’t like egg shells in your omelette. That’s the reason for low rating. It’s unacceptable to have egg shells in an omelette
8,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Good food, good place, price reasonable!!!"
9,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Having memories of good, authentic Chinese food in an unremarkable space some 10 years earlier, I wondered if Nan Kee could still deliver. It does! The space is as unfriendly as ever and seems largely the same, the service can feel a bit …"
10,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,a month ago,Good food but terrible service. The waitress had literally zero intention in showing any hospitality and they were all kind of like pass by your table lets just throw the dishes on the table and doei! …
11,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 months ago,I come here to eat each time I'm in town. Love the roasted duck and the wonton soup! Authentic Cantonese food!
12,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place for oriental chinese food such as peking duck, wanton mee etc. Food was decent but it felt like the foods were missing something. It could be better but nonetheless, it is still a good place for chinese food. Fried rice could be …"
13,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"This Nam Kee is a nice place to eat indoors. When a friend visited, we went here several nights in a row because it was so good! …"
14,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,2 months ago,The duck meat was ok but the sauce is super tasty. I prefer the Wing Kee restaurant just some minutes up the street which is better both in quality and in price.
15,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The restaurant look simple & small from the outside. However the roast duck, char siew (roast pork) are tasty & well prepared.  The staff are friendly, and unlike other Chinese eateries are not pushy.  Politely they let you decide if you wish to share the food.  Portions are big by Asian standards. Price $$+"
16,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Very nice Chinese restaurant, fast and friendly service from the staffs. The foods are also taste great and delicious , big portion. Worth to try."
17,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As Chinese dishes in Europe, Nam Kee is pretty good! I like the steam oyster with black bean sauce, that is the best of the night. The sweet and sour sauce sparerib is foreigner favorite. The fried rice will never lose. A goog Chinese Resturant! They have 2 branches around that area."
18,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Loved every bit of the amazing food that we ate. This has been my best experience of Chinese food so far in Amsterdam. Totally recommended and totally worth it. Also the quantity is a lot!
19,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It was a typical Chinese noodle soup/duck place. No free tap water, service is just adequate as is the case with many Chinese places. The food is good though and it perfectly satisfied us and was compare to what we get at home in California"
20,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,5 months ago,These people got some food for ya! My first time trying Peking duck and it delivered. Fair prices and good portions too. I recommend it
21,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great CANTONESE kitchen - I have been here several times and it is def the best authentic cantonese kitchen I know in Europe. I cant understand the complains about service or bones in chicken -  if you want boneless chicken wings please go to uncle KFC!
22,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Very nice small chinise restaurant , you find hire many kinde of food ;)"
23,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Had a wonderful feast there! Reminds me of my mother's cook, and the price is also surprisingly affordable! Totally will come back again!"
24,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice wonton noodle with good texture. Pretty quick service.  They seems to have a lot more selection so will be back to check it out.
25,Nam Kee, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Awful Chinese food, and very bad service. We asked to eat outside  2 tables left free and the woman shouted on us “no outside, inside”. Run away if you like good chinese food."
26,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Recommended busy place, got served quickly. Sensible prices."
27,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Wonton soup, fried rice and roasted duck were sooo delicious. But I do NOT recommend oysters, strongly believe that oysters should be raw, but they have them steamed. We gave them a chance, but it wasn't good."
28,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Very nice in the heart of Amsterdam. Good quality Cantonese food!
29,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good authentic Chinese restaurant in the center area, the price is fair because the dishes are huge, u can share almost every meal, this is how the natives eat. Fresh food and quick service (they do know English). Good Chinese experience in Amsterdam."
30,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My favourite Chinese restaurant in Amsterdam. Cantonese cuisine, tasty food, large choice of dishes (including vegetarian), big portions, reasonable prices. The setting is a bit tacky. The little bottles on your table that look like Maggi …"
31,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Too many bones in duck dish. You should choose boneless one. But still tasty and authentic
32,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best of the best. The best Chinese food in the world.  And I went to a fair number.  Food is fantastic.  Light, original, full of tastes and smells.  The ambiance and the service are not the best.  But this is not essential for enjoying well-prepared food."
33,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Had a great vegan dish which I loved, will come back!"
34,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good food with very large portion and good price as well. The service is really fast even though it's quite busy. Highly recommend
35,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The staff members were really efficient.
Wasn't too pleased with the quality of the food. The duck on my rice dish was reheated by the chef. The quantity for the price was good though."
36,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Best Wonton Noodle
37,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicious food, great service, I’d recommend the duck and rice!"
38,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Will not recommend the food here... unfortunately, we were craving for Chinese food and this came recommended by locals. We also tried the Chinese restaurant beside it - the standard of the food was similar but cheaper."
39,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Good taste, Big portion, Reasonable  price for Hongkong style Chinese food.Recommend to visit.  Good location easy to find."
40,Nam Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The staff give us a very bad service, telling us no place to sit, but actually they have plenty of place to sit , instead they don’t want to serve us. While when we order the food they are so rude , telling us that we have the menu and we …"
41,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent food! Great service! Big portion!
42,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best Chinese restaurant in the main Amsterdam central as always ☺️☺️ the boss recognize me haha . Lovely
43,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I'll recommend the wan tan soep... delicious especially in the winter.  Bief dishes are lately not so good as before..strange bief structure and taste. Prices and proportions are good compared to the restaurants in the area Nieuwmarkt, Amsterdam"
44,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Legit Cantonese place. Wontons are good but only come in either 4 or 12 and the beef tendon/stew noodle soup is plentiful and hearty.
45,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best Chinese restaurant in Amsterdam. I recommend the Babi Pangang and Tsjasjieuw combined with Chinese Bami.
46,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food is bit too greasy overall....
47,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Bravo to the chef! Excellent balance between quality, quantity and price."
48,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Still one of my favorite places to eat, no long waits for the food and would recommend everyone to eat here."

50,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Good og chinese food
Big portions"
51,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"As always, super good and yummy food, nice staff and service. Good normal prices. Recommended 🤟🏽"
52,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,We came here with a group and ordered a number of dishes. The portion sizes were quite big as we couldn't finish all that we had ordered. The food is OK. The standard chinese fair. All was served quite quickly but I missed the warmth in the …
53,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is an outstanding Cantonese Chinese restaurant. This place is authentic as you are going to get unless you actually go to Hong Kong.
I had the Hot & Sour Soup with Seafood as an appetizer. It was very tasty and …"
54,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,5 months ago,I found it rather bland and overpriced.
55,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A very nice place to eat. Somewhere in the middle between  quick-eat-and-go and restaurant (with more 'luxurious' atmosphere) . The food is good. Prices are good. The service and attention are great. Nice owner. If you want a good meal with a couple of friends or alone,this is a place I would definitely recommend."
56,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is good, served reasonably quickly and price is OK."
57,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good Chinese food! Great service! The oysters are HUGE and AMAZING!
58,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very nice and good Chinese food for a very good price!!!
59,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent all around. My new favourite Chinese restaurant.
60,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The crispy pork. Every time. This dish has become legendary among my friends. Any time I am in Amsterdam we come to Nam Kee's specifically for that. Their food is reasonably priced and delicious. On my last visit I ate here 3 nights out of …
61,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Recommended! The duck and pork belly were delicious. The service was fast even though it was busy. The experience itself might be bit of a let down if you expect something fancy but great if you just want tasty food.
62,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I came here on a recommendation from my canal cruise boat captain.  I hadn't actually planned to eat Chinese food on this trip but it sounded good at the moment.  I also went with some other people from the cruise so it was a good way for …
63,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good cuisine, wonderful oysters. The rest is quite dull.
Staff is unfriendly.
Expensive, though the plates are quite big. …"
64,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I have been to this restaurant 6 years ago and yesterday again. It has kept its standard of food fairly. Price and food are good, waitresses are very busy and old ""hongkong style"" without smile and throw food to the table. However, fairly speaking it is still one of the best restaurants on this street."
65,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Went to this Nam Kee for lunch and wouldn’t go back there again. The oysters were terrible. They had no taste at all. Was really excited to go to this place after some recommendations from friends but unfortunately my experience wasn’t good at all. A lot of bone in the Peking duck.
66,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great little place for roast duck and crispy noodles.
67,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Overall: authentic Cantonese Chinese restaurant with a cozy atmosphere.

Food: the first thing you see after entering the restaurant is the smallish …"
68,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, but the service sucks, drinks are gross... We ordered ice tea and what was brought to us tasted like it had been sitting out for years it was undrinkable... They kept throwing dishes in this box which made the dinning experience …"
69,Nam Kee, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food was good, but we were absolutely shocked at the unprofessional attitude of the server. We had 6 people, and the server offered an option to either pay altogether, or to pay separately. We chose to pay separately. The waiter has …"
70,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Overall, what you see from the outside is more or less what you get from the inside. …"
71,Nam Kee, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Very nice roasted duck.
The female waitress though was very rude. Unpleasant and served all the Asians before me. …"
72,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The wonton soup is a must-try: flavourful soup base, thin wraps and nicely seasoned fillings. The water spinach (morning glory) was good too. We tried a mixed grill dish with duck and pork belly, and we prefer the pork."
73,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Reasonable pricing. Fast service. Even at 6pm we had to queue for a bit.
Wanton noodles 4* (soup was good)
Siew yok 4* (nice taste but very fatty) …"
74,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Great food and service! Definitely a must go
75,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Ordered 12.50€ chicken and got a full plate of food, satisfied"
76,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,a year ago,"We had an issue with our take out, but management was very nice and quick to fix the problem. Seems not all dishes are as good as they would be in the restaurant which we will still go to."
77,Nam Kee, 1 star ,a year ago,"The quality of the duck meat was very bad.
In the end we had to pay one of the two ducks.
As the boss saw that I wrote this review he got very agressiv, threw the bill into my face and kickt us out."
78,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best Chinese restaurants in Amsterdam. Always busy, always good food. Especially the oysters are very nice, but also the duck is particularly good.
You may have to wait for a table and may be asked to leave as soon as your done. But that's all worth it"
79,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"I haven't had better Chinese in Europe. With authentic spices and hearty meats, this is the right choice for serious appetites. I recommend the oysters, which are a steal at 2.50 each. They are probably the biggest oysters I have ever seen. …"
80,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"I love their sweet corn soup !!!

For main dishes .. one dish is enough for two people."
81,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"As a Hong Kong Chinese, the food here is excellent. Fired noodle could be better if the chef give less sauce and make it a bit thick. But the shrimp is awesome!! The second time here and will definitely come back again when I travel to Amsterdam again."
82,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice place to grab lunch or dinner.  If you come during peak times, it will usually be a 20 to 30 minute wait.  So best to make a reservation first.  The food quality is excellent and the selection is quite alot.  Prices are about on par with the other major Chinese restaurants in the area."
83,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Had to wait a while but it was totally worth it, we had peking duck, chicken cashew, happy squid with chilly and vegetables, rice and noodles. The duck was very nice and the chicken cashew totally awesome, noodles were good too. Would totally go there again."
84,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Looking for the best dishes when walking arround Amsterdam? Here you will find it
85,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food! I have been coming back  here for the last 30 years or more, the food has been excellent each and every time. Authentic Chinese. Delicious! And very fair prices."
86,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,a year ago,"You cant get more authentic Chinese food than Nam Kee in Amsterdam. Their food is as good as you can get in HK. Very often you see table of 1 Chinese/Asian quietly enjoying their food in NamKee, it is a good sign that their food is craved …"
87,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good food and price. Duck was great!
88,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very delicious and authentic food, highly recommendable! Will definitely eat here again. Price is good, too! The staff is a bit too friendly to entirely achieve the same cozy atmosphere as these local cha chaan teng in Hong Kong with their impatient waiters/waitresses do, but besides that they do extremely well :)"
89,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Food, Very Friendly Staff. Been here several times and the staff gives you always the best service they can. A very busy place. So if you don't want to wait go there on not regular hours. The food is excellent and   certainly not expensive. So if you like Chines food go there! One of the best Chinese Restaurant in Amsterdam!"
90,Nam Kee, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The food quality is below the average level. The worst thing is that the service attitude of some aged waiters was terrible! When we were ordering, one waiter said: it is too expensive for you.  So angry! I will never be there again!"
91,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Actually pretty good food, but standard Chinese restaurant service - 'efficient' - is the most polite way to describe it. They'll stick you anywhere they possibly can, slam menus and food on your tables, hurry off and forget about you, …"
92,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious Chinese food recommended!!!
93,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,a month ago,Cozy place with very tasty food
94,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent. Far underrated here. Peking duck was a taste explosion, so juicy! Just be prepared it can be a packed place and the service is fast and direct (so they won't treat you like in a star restaurant)."
95,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Not my favourite restaurant, since the meat was not really good, but the rest of the dish was fine. The staff was friendly, but my friends and I were sat at a table that was rather uncomfortable, as we did not have enough space at all."
96,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Its a nice place to eat prices are normal like every other chinees restaurants. Food is nice and staff is normally not special also not terribly just normal. Will go there again for a quick bite.
97,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"The service was OK, but far from friendly. I had the peking duck, which tasted great but was full of small, sharp pieces of bone - difficult to eat without a knife! The dumplings I had for a starter were good, but I don't think I'll return."
98,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff were appalling, barely spoke English and weren't very welcoming. The duck I had was amazing. The food is great, pricing was also okay. They've lost 1 star for service."
99,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Nothing like it used to be.
Unfriendly staff, we were welcomed in with ‘Go sit where you want!’... after receiving the 22 page menu your almost harassed every 30 seconds by someone asking …"
100,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent real gourmet chineese restaurant in the heart of Amsterdam.
Very good laquered duck and steamed oysters! Moderate prices (25€ per person with beer)"
101,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Want some authentic Cantonese cuisine? Nam Kee has some  good duck - not too fatty with nice moist meat. The charred pork is lean and tasty. The crispy pork is crunch and light. The place definitely is a gem, run by immigrants from Hong Kong. Definitely worth a visit if you want some good Chinese in the city."
102,Nam Kee, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Visited two or three times in last years. The food quality kept unchanged and not high quality. Recently, saying last Sat, we had lunch there. Tja siew(roasted pork) is like dry aged meat and not juicy at all. A veg dish tastes like …"
103,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"it's ok, but they use Glutamat"
104,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Sticky tables and unfriendly owner, sits watching TV and reading paper while we are eating. Asked for Seven Up and was told there was none while a few cans were visible in the fridge. When pointed this out I was greeted with a cynical …"
105,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The restaurant is very good . With original Chinese food. People are very kind. Fresh ingredients.  We remembered the best traditional restaurants in China we ate last year. The 2  kids ( ten and seven years old ) ask me to eat at Nan Kee …
106,Nam Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,Very bad. They should remove lemon chicken from the menu.
107,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I've been missing these 2 menus for so long! I think both of them are also their selling point and they did not disappoint me!!!
108,Nam Kee, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Keep away! Terrible Chinese food, it was disgusting and the pork wasn't cooked. My girlfriend was very ill afterwards and I am back now lying on my sofa unable to move. I feel terrible. It has to be the worse I've had in my life and they …"
109,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,a year ago,Authentic lively funny little hoke in the wall that serves THE most fantastic Food!!! We over ate but the bursting tummies were worth it....just fabulous
110,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Zi best stir fry Singapore style in universe
111,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We have been a couple times, the food is higher priced than other places around, and definitely not better quality than it's competitors.  AND, when we paid, I was told I must give a tip and I must do it in cash!  Service wasn't very good and how rude!"
112,Nam Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Looks promising and appetising from outside but it was a huge disappointment. The pork gyoza was decent but their fried/barbecue meats were cold, dry and flavourless. Service was horrible."
113,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Pretty expensive for Chinese food but not bad
114,Nam Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We when there at 11:30 and asked if the restaurant is opened (it said open at 11:30 on the door), the kitchen staff (mid aged guy) at the entrance was very rude and said it’s not opened yet in Cantonese (we asked in English), I wasn’t quite …"
115,Nam Kee, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I was visiting Amsterdam and went with two friends for dinner here and we all got food poisoning afterwards! My friends had fever and diarrhoea, and I felt like throwing up the whole night and had huge stomachache!!! Ruined my trip and plans for the next day. :(("
116,Nam Kee, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We where in on a busy day, that said the food was fast and plenty. But of terrible quality and thrown on a plate. Meat terribly overcooked and staf very unfriendly"
117,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Super unfriendly staff BUT the food is great! Fast service and big portions. The taste is really unique.
118,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice, and a beautiful atmosphere"
119,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Favourite Chinese restaurant for oysters
120,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"We have heard great reviews and there was a queue outside, so our expectations were high. The food was nice but not particularly amazing. Though the service was fast, the staff overall appeared rather unfriendly. Still, nice place to eat, with great value for money."
121,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"If you miss Hong Kong Chinese food in Amsterdam, you must go there.  It offers you good Hong Kong like meals. Standard “Char Xiu” will not disappoint you. Fired rice and noodles are up to standard. Price is reasonable in Amsterdam market. …"
122,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best Chinese in Town, don't even waste time in reading this....just go! 😍
Nothing chic but the food is excellent. Not expensive and pretty tasty."
123,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great place, exactly food."

125,Nam Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Avoid at all cost. This place serve bad chinese dishes. I never had such bad chinese cuisine, this ranks the worst i had so far. …"
126,Nam Kee, 1 star ,2 years ago,A little mouse dying on the floor near our table. The waitress asked the kitchen guy to do something about it. What he did was kick the poor mouse to the next table and walked away.  The customer from that table was terrified and couldn't …
127,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Authentic Cantonese style food, even taste  better than many in the original region. Try the oyster and the roast pork!"
128,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Good food, cheap cheap. They're known for their oysters. Order the plumb duck, it's not on the menu. You'll thank me later."
129,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Went here on recommendation as this place is well known and has been around for quite some time. I found it very average and lacking flavour.
130,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"It was NOT CLEAN. Spare yourself. Got diarhea and i cant describe what worse,my toilet after i was done or the service attitude there. Food also was average."
131,Nam Kee, 1 star ,4 years ago,Never ever again. Super bad service. Food was served quick but greasy and not tastefull. When we did order another drink it wasn't served. When we complained in Dutch and Englisch they only replied in Chinees.
132,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best Asian food in Amsterdam, in the heart of china town. The quality of the food,  the friendly service and the accurate prices make this one of my favorite restaurants."
133,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Authentic Hong Kong style boiled noodles with oyster sauce are very tasty! The waiting staff is not very friendly though.
134,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It is a real chinese restaurant. I always order crispy pork and duck. And also waterspinach. It is a busy restaurant so make sure you are ready to queue in a peak hou.
135,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is ok, compared to Wingkee, Hoi Ting and New King, the food are similar but only service, there is a woman who treat customers badly like they dont need customers. So sad for the service."
136,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Since years one of the most renowned Chinese restaurants. Unfriendly staff but very tasty Chinese food. Very affordable.
137,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food was ok. One of the waiters was slightly cold to us but very nice to the locals.

143,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A wonderful little Vietnamese gem in the Hague. Service is quick, staff are attentive and the dishes delicious."
144,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,9 years ago,Just like the mainland except for the peking duck which is just ok. The other dishes especially the oyster are really good. Long line after 5 so get there early
145,Nam Kee, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Average quality food, high price. Was given food that we never ordered. Staff become abusive when this is pointed out. Will never return to this hell hole"

149,Nam Kee, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The experience in this restaurant is extremely awful. The service is terrible, staff just throw dishes on our table. And they forced us to give tips otherwise we can not pay the bill and cannot leave as well. Food is just so so."
150,Nam Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very disappointing. 100% indifferent customers.

After an hour of calling without an answer I went to see them to see what the …"
151,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,There are not many Chinese restaurants that can compare with Nam Kee. The teppan dishes are highly recommended.
