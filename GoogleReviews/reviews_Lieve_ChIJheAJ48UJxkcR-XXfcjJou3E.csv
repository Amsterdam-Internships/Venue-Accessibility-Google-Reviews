0,Lieve, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent wine and delicious food. You can share small plates or order individually. Elegant modern design with a funny baroque twist, friendly staff and really good atmosphere."
1,Lieve, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Awful food, takes way too long between the first and second dish. Very poor quality meat, just don't go here. Waste of money, time and experience. As true Amsterdammer I'm ashamed. We can do better than this."
2,Lieve, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This restaurant has a lot of mixed reviews, and I'm not sure why.  I had a great experience and I'll share my experience.  I made reservations online and when we arrived, a table by the window was waiting for us.  Mom and I had eaten a lot …"
3,Lieve, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"The restaurant has a very different offer: 3 in 1. If you want to know more about it, you should definitely go. The staff is really friendly and the ambience is really nice. The food is good, but they are limited on the offers. The tapas …"
4,Lieve, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food and service were both excellent. There's two different styles of menu: the share menu (33euro per person), where you get to pick a few cold, hot, and sweet dishes, and the course menu, where you get to do between 1-4 courses …"
5,Lieve, 4 stars ,6 years ago,A very nice restaurant with many regional options. The interior is very welcoming and it looked busy enough to make me trust the food ;) …
6,Lieve, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"The atmosphere is cosy and romantic. However, the food was less than expected, and so was the service which was friendly but slow.
We took the shared menu; 3 courses, with paired wines. The wine was great. But …"

9,Lieve, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Really bad restaurant. (It used to be OK in the past, so don't be fooled by the good OLD reviews). A four course menu of 27 euro's might appear cheap, but when you see what you get you will be in shock. First a little pork roll of about 20 …"
10,Lieve, 2 stars ,5 years ago,How do these places stay in business? 1h 20 before getting your mains? Who has got time for this? …
11,Lieve, 1 star ,5 years ago,We arrived at Lieve at 8pm and had to wait 1.5 hour for our first course and half an hour for our drinks to arrive. My husband had to go inside to the bar himself to get Tabasco because service was slow perhaps management isn't efficient. …
12,Lieve, 1 star ,4 years ago,We arrived at the restaurant at 8pm restaurant was very nice. We were seated starters came very quickly and were very nice. During this time no one came and asked if we were ok. …
13,Lieve, 2 stars ,4 years ago,It was beyond slow we were originally Shepherded into this buffer zone for 30 mins and when we finally got to our table we ordered á la carte and each got an entré and a main course it was 40 mins between meals. My meal was ok but my …
14,Lieve, 1 star ,9 years ago,"We had the Belgian Baroque and in over a year of going to Dutch restaurants this was the worst dining experience we've had considering the price point. Only one out of seven dishes was good. I wouldn't recommend going there, I've had much better food at cafés at a quarter of the price."
15,Lieve, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"This place has wonderful food and a good (but not huge) selection of Belgian beers. The Wild Boar and Deer stew is worth the visit alone. It may have been that it's a Saturday evening, but the service wasn't engaging as it should be, but don't let that put you off."
16,Lieve, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The only reason this gets a star is the waitstaff was lovely.  Come to this ""Belgium"" restaurant if you want to feel overcharged for sub par food while you are being made fun of.  As a New Yorker...I will concede to being spoiled.  However, …"
17,Lieve, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We found the Belgian Baroque menu provided several courses of culinary delight with Belgian beer pairings (including from small breweries) that worked.  The crab cakes, cod,  pork neck, and salad options were all delicious, and the two of us climaxed on three desserts, including a kriek (cherry) beer paired with cherry tiramusu."
18,Lieve, 5 stars ,11 years ago,"good variety of Belgium beers. enjoyed a lot baroque style with lots of small plates. kitchen is not perfect (some of the dishes are ""just fine""), but good enough. recommended!"
19,Lieve, 1 star ,5 years ago,"They used oil fish as cod, which caused me a diarrhea within 1 hour. Pretty bad! Very strangely they don't have side dish, such as potato or bread. After the dinner, I still have to buy a hamburger as I was till rather hungry :-("
20,Lieve, 1 star ,7 years ago,"Food not so tasty, soup too salty, small portions and the price quite inadequate to poor quality. Service slow - we waited an hour for the second course. All the waiters dressed in dirty green tshirts, lack of opportunity to divide the bill. Never again."
21,Lieve, 5 stars ,5 years ago,We happened upon this by chance and enjoyed a delightful sharing menu with house selected matching wines for every nenu choice.  A delightful end to our stay in Amsterdam.
22,Lieve, 5 stars ,11 years ago,"Woow!! The Netherlands is not know for their good service but here at LIEVE we were pampered! Great food, excellent personalized service and good location. Not cheap but I'm more then willing to pay for great quality of the food and service. We ordered the most exclusive dining option: 'Gastronomisch'."
23,Lieve, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great selection of gluten free dishes. Service was a bit slow, but the restaurant was packed when I went - so it's understandable."
24,Lieve, 4 stars ,10 years ago,Great food and beer. We got the beer matches with each course and the sheer quantity of beer was a bit overwhelming. Don't let your eyes get the better of you!
25,Lieve, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great service, great food, couldn't believe the price for what we got.
