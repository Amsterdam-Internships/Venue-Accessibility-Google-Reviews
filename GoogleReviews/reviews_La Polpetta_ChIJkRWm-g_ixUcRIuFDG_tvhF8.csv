0,La Polpetta, 5 stars ,a month ago,Very tasty pizza and great portion! We will definitely order again :)
1,La Polpetta, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"I ordered some desserts here and what I got was horrible. The pastiera was dry and the tiramisu was unforgiving. Definitely the worst I have tasted in my life; the biscuit was soggy, the creme was watery, store-bought whipped cream and it ‚Ä¶"
2,La Polpetta, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice Italian place, the food tasted good and service was pleasant. Came for lunch but it just opened so we were the only ones dining but nonetheless the atmosphere was still quite nice. I really do recommend the bruschetta as well, ‚Ä¶"
3,La Polpetta, 1 star ,2 years ago,Had delivery pizza and it was... not great. Overcooked. The crust had no stretch to it: it was lifeless and dry. There are way better pizzerias at the same price point in the area: Mangia and Sotto.
4,La Polpetta, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Best Italian place in Amsterdam ! Fantastic south Italy style Pizza , and everything else is also just fantastic . The salads, eggplant, ect . Highly recommended !"
5,La Polpetta, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Soo good, order here so many times, the pizzas and calzone are delicious!!
Veramente pizze buonissime!!"
6,La Polpetta, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Dough/crust is very good and delivered very fast. However the tomatosauce could use a lot more flavor and the pizza was very greasy, oily and had little taste. I'll try again soon since reviews are good and the crust was great and this might have been a one time thing."
7,La Polpetta, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Authentic Italian pizza in an informal and warm place. Totally recommended.
8,La Polpetta, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ordered a delivery and was very very disappointed. The only good thing was the arrival time, the issue was that even tho everything arrived in less then 30 minutes all the food was completely cold. ‚Ä¶"
9,La Polpetta, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Haven't try many pizza places in Amsterdam but, I have to stay that ""La Polpetta"" delivers some decent Italian pizzas. üòÑ The combination of styles are well thought out, giving a delightful taste. üëåüèª"
10,La Polpetta, 1 star ,a month ago,ordered 4 pizzas and got 2 cold ones. not recommended
11,La Polpetta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super nice Parmigiana di melanzane and meatballs. The meatballs portion is huge! Good packaging for delivery also keeps it warm
12,La Polpetta, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very delicious pizza's and very kind and friendly people.
Me and my Italian boyfriend are quite picky about pizza's, but these ones are perfetto!"
13,La Polpetta, 5 stars ,a year ago,"La Polpetta is my go to solution for a lazy dinner night. Pasta is amazing and the burrata is so so soft. But the best is the pizza, we usually have to order an extra one to munch on later. Homemade food with heart and love"
14,La Polpetta, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Can recommend, very nice food."
15,La Polpetta, 1 star ,a year ago,Avoid at all costs. We were walking by and saw the owner pushing a delivery guy on the floor and slamming him. ‚Ä¶
16,La Polpetta, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Food was OK but the service was appalling - it took almost an hour for a few pizzas despite the lady saying it would take maximum 15 minutes. A lot of deliveroo drivers came in, which was a bit distracting, but I actually ended up feeling really bad for them all having to deal with the terribly rude owners."
17,La Polpetta, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Rude staff and unprofessional customer service

Edit: I was threatened to get ""kicked/beaten up"" for this review in person, ‚Ä¶"
18,La Polpetta, 5 stars ,a year ago,Only place in town where you can find a real Italian pizza. Delicious!!
19,La Polpetta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"French, lived in Italia between Milano and Palermo and I've to say this is my favorite place in Amsterdam. Everything is fresh, pizze seem like coming straight from Italia, lasagna definitely worth a try... Long story short, this is the place. Grazie ragazzi !"

22,La Polpetta, 1 star ,2 years ago,Worst pizza I've ever had served by Italians. Feels more like a laundry business than a good establishment. Move on!

24,La Polpetta, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Tasty food made with authentic ingredients, fair price ratio, and very kind service. Recommended!"
25,La Polpetta, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nutella dessert was quite dry. And in my opinion it should be clearer if a pizza has no tomato sauce.

29,La Polpetta, 1 star ,3 years ago,Food served fresh but had to wait 40 to 60 minutes. Not recommended. They had bad talk from delivery riders because of time management.
