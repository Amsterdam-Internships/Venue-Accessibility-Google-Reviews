0,Pane & Olio, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The perfect spot for morning coffee. The owner greets you in Italian, speaks a little English, and is super friendly. My double espresso cost three euros and was as good as any I've had in Italy."
1,Pane & Olio, 5 stars ,a month ago,"The perfect Italian seduction! I was walking by the store by the time it was opening, so I had the chance to see the preparation of the goodies. Everything is freshly made with best quality ingredients. I tried the Ricotta and strawberry pie and it was heavenly good. Also the owner is the sweetest traditional Italian man."
2,Pane & Olio, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Not a person to leave reviews but this place deserves every bit of it.

I crossed this place often and was always tempted to try the food as everything ‚Ä¶"
3,Pane & Olio, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I'm so happy that I found this place. It started to grow in me, the only critic that I have is the microwave reheating food, it is possible to do it differently. They use very nice products, though"
4,Pane & Olio, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I've been coming here for years and it's my local favorite for Italian breakfast (coffee + dolce) and lunch. It's perhaps so good that it's in the top 3 of things I missed the most during WFH in the corona lockdowns. ‚Ä¶
5,Pane & Olio, 1 star ,4 months ago,The food was tasty and the place authentic but the hygiene is an absolute no-go. Touching the food with unwashed hands + a very dirty and messy kitchen/dining area ruined the experience entirely.
6,Pane & Olio, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Located in a great central position, 2 minutes walk from Dam Square. Great authentic italian food freshly made everyday by the owners. A bit pricy, but absolutely justified by location and quality. Vegetarian and vegan options available too"
7,Pane & Olio, 5 stars ,5 months ago,A great place where to eat real Food and the owners are so nice. I highly recommend it if visiting Amsterdam.

11,Pane & Olio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Its just a small place, but I liked that about it. In a big city like Amsterdam I appreciated the cosy sized place and atmosphere. Very Italian, lovely options for ciabatta sandwiches, croissants and bruschetta. I got a pan au chocolate, ‚Ä¶"
12,Pane & Olio, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice coffee and good croissant. I just tried it for breakfast. I can see also focaccia and other things looking really good.

Closer to Italy isn‚Äôt possible. ‚Ä¶"
20,Pane & Olio, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Soup was ok. Toasted sandwiches were good but expensive, but I don't expect these to be much cheaper in the center of the city. Cheese cake great."
