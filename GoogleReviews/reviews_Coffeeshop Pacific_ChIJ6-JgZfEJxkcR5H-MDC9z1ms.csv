0,Coffeeshop Pacific, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Seems little, not much furnitured or styled but with some clear space to sit. Not much choice of weed, some coca-cola's BUT (!) tried their powdered gruis/mix (7‚Ç¨/g) and found it strong and delicious... should not speak of it at all.. all for me than!"
1,Coffeeshop Pacific, 1 star ,4 years ago,Nice local location. Lovely flower and polite service with good prices. The decor inside is very dated though. And lacked any atmosphere as it was empty and dreary looking.  Please give the place a little love and update it a bit. Seating needs to be changed with holes etc with filling coming out. Shame to see.
2,Coffeeshop Pacific, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice weed, good prices, nice people. There are fun things to do in the shop.
The ambiance is okay,
but two different types of music can be a bit annoying."
3,Coffeeshop Pacific, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"This small coffee shop doesn't look incredible from the outside, but pass the door and you will discover a cozy place to chill, with soft sofas and documentaries on TV. ‚Ä¶"
4,Coffeeshop Pacific, 5 stars ,a year ago,great service and nice people... Not so many tourists in there. It was really nice to stay in there for a while.
5,Coffeeshop Pacific, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Located in an area with few other coffeeshops, this place is an oasis. Amazing brownie (7.5‚Ç¨) had a fudge-like mouthfeel and not dense like others I've tried here. Very reasonable prices, though the smoking area seems outdated but who really cares about that?"
