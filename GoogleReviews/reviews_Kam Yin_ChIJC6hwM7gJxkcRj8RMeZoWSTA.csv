0,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"My colleague recommended me this place. And it is indeed one of the best restaurants for Chinese and Surinamese food! It’s not expensive and the quality is top. The portions are enormous. The dish for 8,50 can be taken for two people. …"
1,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"The tomato soup had ketchup in it. That was utterly disappointing. However, the noodles and the sweet/sour chicken was nice. Hence the 4 stars."
2,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Price = okay
Taste = a bit dry pork, could feel a bit gamy taste from dumpling, and noodles were okay …"
3,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"The food is good (the soups are always very good but in some of the dishes the meat is too dry or they are too oily), the quantity of it is very generous compared to the price(sometimes I'm not even able to finish it). The staff is overall …"
4,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,a month ago,"why 5 stars you ask? Well, the word is consistent quality. Bang on every time and I have got their takeouts like 15-20 times. Again consistent, quality and flavors."
5,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Looking for a nice Chinese .... I think this is the place. Service good... food tasty.... I saw roti on the menu too. Proper roti! They say its Surinamese cuisine...I didn't know Surinamese cuisine was so varied, but I'm glad. The food was …"
6,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is cozy, the staff is nice and they bring out your food in less than 10 minutes. The food here is kind of like the Chinese fast food back in the States but a bit fancier and tastier."
7,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Oh my god, first time trying Suriname food and I was totally satisfied with the food.great and delicious and good prices!"
8,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This restaurant is a great option if you are looking for a delicious meal with prices that are not too expensive. Ordered a Bami with chicken and pork for only €8,50 and got a lot of food! Would definitely recommend!"
9,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The price for food is ok. Not expensive for a restaurant in the central of Amsterdam. I often eat bread with bakkeljauw (a kind of fish) or shrimp, moksimeti bami ( 4 kinds of meat with nooddle). The photos are bakkeljauw and kipsate."
10,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The vegetarian surinamese noodles were difficult to eat and a bit bland. The chilly sauce made things better.
11,Kam Yin, 1 star ,2 years ago,That is supposed to be sweet and sour pork. The pork was hidden in those huge deep fried balls of batter. 5% pork 40% deep fried batter (very savory from whatever was fried in that oil the rest of the day) 45% plain white rice 9% sweet and sour sauce (soaked immediately by the balls of batter) and 1% canned pineapple.
12,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good and reasonably priced. efficient staff great choice of food.
13,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was okey, service was the same, would not come here again. You get what you pay for. Never forget that. …"

15,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"I like the variety they have here, but we have the charsiu and duck and for me, the charsiu is abit dry."
16,Kam Yin, 1 star ,4 months ago,Very bad Chinese Food to be honest. Rice was not good and the chicken taste like mass husbandry.
17,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious Chinese food in downtown Amsterdam.  Great service and good food!
18,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A cute and a comfy place. Good portion sizes and really tasty food. The staff is really kind and delightful.
19,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Lot of food for cheap. Correct. Good. But why not giving a glass with the can ?
20,Kam Yin, 1 star ,4 years ago,I'd rather get a viral infection than come back here again. The taste was a mixture of burned plastic and stale food waste. You might as well eat out of a garbage can.
21,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super yummy food - great service!
22,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lekker! No frills, quality food served at highly affordable prices! Absolute bargain for Amsterdam which is becoming crazy expensive."
23,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,5 months ago,It was my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area.  Please note that it only offers delivery at the moment.  (Covid-19)
24,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Closed for renovations but great to enjoy a moksi meti boven op after almost 3 years away! €8.50 still = a great feed. Recommended.
25,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,This restaurant came recommended by both a Dutch friend who loves Indonesian food and a Singaporean friend who misses food from home. It's a big portion for the price.
26,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good place with good food... affordable and tasy... good service ... if u are looking for a good meal with a limited budget you should try this place.
27,Kam Yin, 1 star ,3 years ago,Worst ever whatever Chinese restaurant. Lemon chicken in a strange yellow fluorescent sauce 😃. Soups are good and cheap.
28,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,8 months ago,We have never been let down whether we dine in or take away. Delivery is pretty quick too especially when Dude shows up on a scooter.
29,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good food and prices are reasonable for the portion provided
30,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This place have a lot of asia food and this restaurant is clean and serve food so fast
31,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great and delicious food! I ordered the chicken fried rice, chicken corn soup, sweet and sour prawns, and prawn crackers. They were l very tasty and huge portions. The staff is also friendly. Definitely will come again."
32,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This is probably the best place for a quick meal on your first day in amsterdam. It is very cheap for what you get and the food is good. I would also recommend it for a casual group dinner. The service is fast and the staff can be friendly …
33,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,They have a large menu of different dishes and it tasted not so bad. The food arrives very fast. Even if a lot of people are ordering at the same time. So it looks a little bit suspicious. The prices are pretty low for a place at such location.
34,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I remembered it being better than it is but if you want a quick and cheap meal in the red light district or near the station this is the place for you. Don’t expect anything spectacular but it’s decent for the price, especially since it’s easy to get trapped in a less than desirable and expensive establishment in Amsterdam."
35,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I started eating here in 1999 when I was in the habit of passing through Amsterdam by train and would stop off for a break, but I eat here several times when in town, which has been about once a year since then. This place used to be very …"
36,Kam Yin, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"All veggies where from a can, staff stressed and food very sub par. Quick service though and nobody got food poisoning, so there's always that. …"
37,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Terrific food in a fast-paced and crowded spot. The restaurant is authentic and stripped-down, with a faded decor, worn and dated fixtures and strictly-business service but everything you need is there in the food, and the portions are generous. Worthy of regular visits!"
38,Kam Yin, 1 star ,4 years ago,Disgusting and Horrible!!!!!!!!  The worst Chinese food I have ever eaten. It is a catastrophe.
39,Kam Yin, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the serving staff members (woman with short hair) was so rude, giving me the menu, food and drinks without saying anything at all. Felt like i was a ghost sorry but that’s not how u can treat your customers. …"
40,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great value for money. Great service and good staff but the food was just ok. Saying that it was still good but we've had a lot better. 5 of us (adults) ate starter and main for just over €100 and none of us could finish our meal it was so big.
41,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Simple but great tasting dishes served at topspeed and comes in large quantities. Prices are very friendly as well! Excellent for quick good and filling dinner
42,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely Chinese restaurant. The service was very fast. We ordered and had our drinks and meals within 5mins. Food was good as was the staff. Place was bust with people coming and going all the time. Lots of locals use this restaurant which was a positive for us.
43,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Nice restaurant located close to the Amsterdam C.S. The take away menu is very good and Lekker-cost to quality. The dine in menu is very long and most of the meat is frozen and re-cooked but the portions are large. …
44,Kam Yin, 1 star ,a year ago,"Don’t go here. Overpriced with very very poor service. Vegetarian options: plain noodles (even when told on the me u they come with veggies). When asking our server about this she was just rude, walked away and we had to pay full price."
45,Kam Yin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The food was terrible, the customer service was worse than the rice that was microwaved for 45 seconds. I asked the waiter how the food was cooked an she went all crazy because the sweet and sour chicken was disgusting. …"
46,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good food, clean and cheap too! After ordering the food is ready in no time. This is not a tourist rip off restaurant and has many local customer's. I have been going there for years. It's located in Amsterdam city centre very near Central Station."
47,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is ok. It's delivered to your table very fast, but otherwise service is really bad. Waiters speak a mix of English and Dutch that's mostly incomprehensible and they don't make much of an effort to understand you and I found the waitress at our table quite rude."
48,Kam Yin, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Just out of the restaurant. Good portion size but staff, at least one of them who served us,  was not friendly. She asked me to go to the pos for the payment instead of brining it to my table. That would have been ok if she did the same for everyone. But she brought the pos to another person who was next to my table.  Not good!"
49,Kam Yin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Starter, soup was good but only built up to a big flop. Main lemon chicken was chicken thigh and tasteless. Fried rice was burnt. Tables constantly moved around. Tables too close. Food well below average .Anyone who has given good reports obviously does not know good Chinese food."
50,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Affordable and super nice asian food
51,Kam Yin, 1 star ,2 years ago,"They petend that the vegetable noodles are for 5€, but they actually are for 6,5€. That's unfair!"
52,Kam Yin, 1 star ,6 years ago,"I've been coming here for years, but it seems like the service and the food has gone from great to bad with every visit. The waitresses don't pay attention to you, they're not friendly, you have to ask for the menus yourself (which is a …"
53,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food for good price. They could do better if they didn't microwave everything, but it's a well known place, I come here already 20+ years, you have your food within 10-15 minutes"
54,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is my go to place when friends are in town.

The menu is like a novel in terms of choice, but I always go for the Roti. It's …"
55,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was a little heavy, but it was a plate of fried noodles and meat. Service was all over the place, I had to flag down the waitress for every little thing. They were quite busy but there were plenty of seats and a quick turn around. Never tried Surinamese food before, but I was happy with my meal."
56,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It’s a nice restaurant, very close to Centraal station. Food is decent, I liked there noodles a lot. Nice place to try Surinaam’s Chinese but I have noticed that their staff members are the noisemakers, that kind of annoying. Staff also turns out to be very cold. They surely need to work on their hospitality skills."
57,Kam Yin, 1 star ,3 years ago,Have previously vitiated and the good was good however on our latest visit the food was okay but the service was terrible. We visited with our 7 year old and 20 month old. It took over 5 minutes for them to bring a high chair to the table. …
58,Kam Yin, 1 star ,9 months ago,One of their employees was incredibly rude on the phone. I had simple questions about their services and got an aggressive response. I do not recommend this place
59,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,a year ago,Kam Yin is one of my favorites in the Netherlands. I tried a number of different dishes and all of them were delicious. Saotosoep is amazing
60,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice Chinese Surinam restaurant. Price to quality is very good. Food wel made and tastes very good and have a large assortment and style of food. Location is a bit sketchy since it's located right the in the centre of Amsterdam. So to …
61,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food - quickly cooked - a basic but decent restaurant. My meal of chick prawns and noodles a big portion too, cost 13 euro"
62,Kam Yin, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was good, the service was quick but the waitresses were really rude when I ask two times a glass of water, and two of them where sitting next to me drining the forks and speaking very loudly!! And happy not kind ending they didn't accept coins like 5cents to pay the bill."
63,Kam Yin, 1 star ,4 years ago,We’re only giving this 1 star because 0 stars was not an option. Where do we even begin! Lets start off with the vomit of this drunk tourist; it looked better then what was served as ‘roti’ on my plate. At the table next to us was someone …
64,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"After 15 years, last time I was in the area, it's still a very good restaurant. It's simple but good food for a very reasonable price. The mix of Oriental and Amsterdam mentality makes that it has a very friendly service"
65,Kam Yin, 1 star ,4 years ago,The worst experience with Chinese food of my life. Food looks microwaved ( from orders to service it took less than 5 minutes ). Noodles tasteless and dry. Best thing was tap water
66,Kam Yin, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Peking duck wasn't crispy and the small bones were only partially removed, creating an illusion of safety. In general rather low quality food. Attracts loud clients: singing party goers and the like."
67,Kam Yin, 1 star ,6 years ago,"When we wanted our order taken, they ignored us a couple of times before taking our order. The food arrived and it wasn't pleasant looking at all, the portion size for the noodle/rice is larger than the pork/duck. The pecking duck had …"
68,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Always crowded even not during meal time. Almost everything have a good taste there. Fast service with short time waiting for the meal. However, sometimes the service is less good. The waiter should go for holiday and smile often."
69,Kam Yin, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Went there to get a take-away box, as they advertised rice +1 veg+1 meat is 6,50 EUR. After ordering the rice and a meat, the staff told me that adding a veg would be another 2 euros. When I asked her about the advertisement on the door, …"
70,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very popular and busy Chinese restaurant. Great location near the centraal station. Various choices of Chinese dishes with reasonable prices that slightly cheaper than other Chinese restaurants in China town.
71,Kam Yin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"A total disaster. Food came 2 minutes after being ordered. Meat and noodles were only warmed up plus oversalted thanks to a Maggi-overload. Please don't spend your money here, there are much better restaurants in Amsterdam."
72,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The menu is rich, but not too many options for vegetarians, unfortunately. The ones I've tried were delicious. The service is fast and good. The prices are fair. Nice atmosphere too."
73,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good tasty chicken curry, delicious Singapore Noodles, tasty Peking duck soup! Friendly quick service. Reasonably priced! We will come again"
74,Kam Yin, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Flavorless, low quality food which is quite expensive.  We ordered a number of dishes like satay, Peking duck with fried rice, fried noodles with chicken, and what was supposed to be a super spicy shrimp dish.  Everything was pretty …"
75,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good prices, tasty food and big portions! This restaurant has Chinese and Surinamese snacks and dishes. Try some Surinamese food, you will be surprised!"
76,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,This place is not a looker at all but it is the premier spot for hearty cheap asian food. The kitchen is Chinese and Surinam and this is reflected in dishes from both cuisines. Rickety tables and harsh light might put some people off but the food quality belies the environment.
77,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As cheap as it gets, and the food is really great. Get the super spicy sauces to add! I go there very often, for lunch or dinner. Hartily recommended!"
78,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is exceptionally good. Location sucks unless you're on foot. Because they charge €0,10 for plastic bags they lose 2 stars."
79,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Price good
Quality yummy
Ambiance mua …"
80,Kam Yin, 1 star ,8 years ago,"The worst food I have ever had. The Peking soup was like snotty vomit and totally insipid. The nasi was burned and the shrimp looked like rubber. The owner ( maybe I m not sure) told me that that s how nasi should be and offended me as a know it all. What can i say , Don t go there!"
81,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Huge portions for quite a low price. Pleasant taste. Would recommend to everyone who’s on a budget but want to enjoy some nice Chinese food
82,Kam Yin, 1 star ,a year ago,It took less than 5 minutes for the food to come and it was terrible. Also the staff is unfriendly and the atmosphere is uncomfortable.
83,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food amazing service
84,Kam Yin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This was a very good place to eat.
Unfortunatly made headlines in local news about a cockroach incident in the takeaway, which turned out to be less incidental.
EDIT: place has been temporarily shut down by health inspectors!"

88,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"If you are looking for restaurant which is next to Amsterdam centrum and with good price then this is the place, they have got Chinese and Surinami menu, they have also got vegetarian option, if you are strict vegetarian and don't also eat …"
89,Kam Yin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the oldest and famous surinamese restaurant in the area. Surinamese food is comfortfood, it is a fusion of javanese,chinese,indian and creole cuisine. The dutch variation of soulfood. Big portions for cheap, take away portions are bigger than the portions in the restaurant. The take away part, has an seperate entrance.."

94,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,a year ago,Simply delicious. Great variety in choice. Fast service and friendly employees!
95,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place. Good food for decent prices. Doesn't look like much though and not the place for a romantic dinner.
96,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Some waitresses are very kind and helpful. I must admit that I only grab lunch here if there is nothing else. The service is not that good bordering on rude during lunch time.

98,Kam Yin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Just for a quite bite. Normal Chinese restaurant.
99,Kam Yin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good foor for low low  prices. And quite tasty. Place is usually packed, but high turnovers make it that you don't wait long for a table"
100,Kam Yin, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I normally buy food from here as take away, but the food I bought yesterday was left over food from the previous day, it was tasteless and bones. Such a waste of money. Won't come here again."
