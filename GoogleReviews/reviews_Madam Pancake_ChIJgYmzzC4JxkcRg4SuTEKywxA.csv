3,Madam Pancake, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"We found this place thanks to google and the good rating , but unfortunately we did not have a 5stars experience, we sat down we received the menu and we had to wait a good 15min before someone took our orders for the food and the coffees, ‚Ä¶"
4,Madam Pancake, 4 stars ,7 months ago,The food was great ! It takes a little while to get it since they are clearly understaffed. The pancakes are fluffy with fresh ingredients. We had the Hangover (bacon and sausage) and Salmon and both were excellent !
5,Madam Pancake, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Visited this place in August 2020. We had to wait 20 minutes to sit. There are less sitting place because of covid. That's ok. The pancakes were good, but not a big deal. The coffee was good. Friendly waiters."
6,Madam Pancake, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"These pancakes are the best pancakes you can find in Amsterdam. Presented beautifully and so tasty that you just can't stop eating.

13,Madam Pancake, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very tasty pancakes and coffee, lots of different sweet and savory options to choose from."
14,Madam Pancake, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Maybe we ate our pancakes quickly because they were so delicious.  Or maybe it was because we were starving to death after waiting almost an hour to receive our order. ‚Ä¶
15,Madam Pancake, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place! The lovely girls made you feel right at home and the pancakes were delicious. Regret not taking something special but the naturals were good too.

16,Madam Pancake, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely caf√© with awesome, beautifully prepared pancakes. You get honey, jam, stroopwafel crumbles and maple syrup on the side to share if you are with someone. It would be nice if they would write on the menu that get those things on the ‚Ä¶"

38,Madam Pancake, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Terrible service, saw mice in the restaurant. We had to wait for 30 minutes to get our pancakes which were very disappointing. The staff is rude and there is trash in front of the door everywhere. This probably explains the mice we saw running around."
39,Madam Pancake, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cute place with nice pancakes and kind staff. I had the Red Crush, which I can recommend, but I feel like the portion could've been a bit bigger for the 11 euros I paid."

71,Madam Pancake, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing just amazing I had the mango tango, doit. Followed by a black coffee no sugar."
72,Madam Pancake, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Taste is fine although super heavy on sugar. The staff is really positively amazing, they are super nice and welcoming. The 3 star is because of the portions being so small compared to other top pancake places. If not for the staff it would be lower."

74,Madam Pancake, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great staff and tasty pancakes!
75,Madam Pancake, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Looks great from the outside, the restaurant is full which usually indicates quality. However, after sitting down the service was so long! We (a group of 4) were sat waiting for almost 1 hours (they only serve pancakes!!!!). Pancakes came out, nice but cold. Not worth the money."
76,Madam Pancake, 1 star ,2 years ago,Madame Pancake is truly an experience. We were seated almost immediately. And by immediately I mean after 10 minutes of standing right next to a half dozen open tables. My friend and I were then graciously allowed to catch up with each ‚Ä¶

80,Madam Pancake, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fluffy perfection! US style pancakes with fresh ingredients in a nice environment!
81,Madam Pancake, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I ordered 2 of the classic nature with maple syrup and it was marvelous. The thickness and consistency of the pancakes was perfect. Definitely a must go, if you‚Äòre in Amsterdam!"
82,Madam Pancake, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Menu has no photos. So if you are not from here and you assume everything is like in somewhere else you may be wrong.
If you order eggs. Scramble or whatever with your pancakes. It‚Äôs not aside, ‚Ä¶"
83,Madam Pancake, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We wanted to try Dutch pancakes and this place serves mini-pancakes with a variety of toppings.  Fun and good tasting after exploring Amsterdam most of the day.  We chose the sweet pancake toppings.  The drinks, from fruit juice to alcoholic, were also enjoyed."
84,Madam Pancake, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely! Pancakes are truly to die for, highly stacked, light in taste and multiple variations, sweet and savory, to choose from. We also shared the oreo donut, which is quite dense and a chocolate cake, really good. Because it's located in ‚Ä¶"
85,Madam Pancake, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We got seated right away with another couple, they got a menu right away and had their orders taken while we were ignored. Multiple times our server made eye contact but continued to not come over to us. After roughly 25 min we got up and ‚Ä¶"

90,Madam Pancake, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice, friendly but a little bit slow service, good food for ok prices."
91,Madam Pancake, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The portions are rather small, I wouldn't go here when starving. It's also not the best pancake of my life. The staff is truly lovely though, and that is quite something, especially in this area of Amsterdam."
92,Madam Pancake, 2 stars ,3 years ago,They don't serve free tap water to patrons - quite stingy. Specials are restricted to parties of two but not mentioned on the menu. Food was well presented and tasty but portions should be bigger for the cost. Do not recommend that one eat here.
93,Madam Pancake, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Really good allocation with plenty space inside, its scamble eggs look like delicious"
94,Madam Pancake, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Genious concept and very good food. I was full after my 3 pancakes and so was my partner. And yes, it's not cheap to costum make your breakfast but it's so worth."

100,Madam Pancake, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food was not as expected, the egg crumbles was terrible. Not only me but other two tables besides me left the pancake, the restaurant need to reconsider the menu‚Äôs quality so that customers can enjoy the food better. ‚Ä¶"

105,Madam Pancake, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Such slow service we waited 20 minutes for a table and then 50 minutes for food. There were only 6 of us. Didn't rate the food much smoked salmon wasn't smoked salmon - it's just a piece of salmon that's been cooked - very odd.
106,Madam Pancake, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The service was slow and we had to wait 30 to take our order. A little less then an hour later we got our pancakes. They where american pancakes. They where ok. But they where dry and we barely had enough syrup.
107,Madam Pancake, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely lovely food but massively expensive. Four of us ate there, we all had pancakes with egg and bacon and a coffee each. The bill came to somewhere around 80 euros. 20 euros per person  for breakfast is not good value"

113,Madam Pancake, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Quite tasty and delicious. Only waited for a few minutes to grab a table. Food and lattes were aesthetically pleasing and they encourage sharing on social media.
114,Madam Pancake, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The Hangover Pancakes have way too less Sour Cream on them. They taste like nothing. Also, it's very pricy there."
115,Madam Pancake, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Super cozy and very comfortable. After a long day of walk around I sat there at the window and was able to relax for a while .. The food was delicious but it take too long to came. Overall I liked very much..
