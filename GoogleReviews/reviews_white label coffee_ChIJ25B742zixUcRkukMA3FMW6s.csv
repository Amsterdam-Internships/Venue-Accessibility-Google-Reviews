0,white label coffee, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,Delicious coffee in a nice hipster ambiance. Downside is card only payments so be prepared. There is fresh water available for you to use for free. I wish music is a bit louder and that the staff is a bit more nicer and friendlier. Small cappuccino is 3.5€ and a bigger one is 4€
1,white label coffee, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great little spot, dare I say hole in the wall. Friendly, knowledgeable, courteous staff who know their stuff. Great tasting variety of coffee. Cozy, comfy seats where you can get lost in conversations for hours. Would recommend for a casual date or catchup with a friend"
2,white label coffee, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Coffee is decent, and so are the pastries and granola.
Unfortunately is not the place to be if you want to also get some work done, while siping your coffee. As they have a pretty sad -no laptop policy-."
3,white label coffee, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Love the place, super friendly staff. Coffee is really good!! Only downside: their stairs are pretty steep, so I always need to pay attention not to miss one :-)"
4,white label coffee, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice coffee, enjoyed it!
Ordered a flat white and it was very good, but not as strong as expected.
Very friendly staff :)"
5,white label coffee, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"What can I say aside from it's the best coffee I've had in this city? I live in waking distance and usually grab the beans to use in my home espresso machine, but the coffee prepared in house is also top notch. Obviously highly recommended."
6,white label coffee, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The staff was really friendly and welcoming. Got a cappuccino and an iced Americano. Both tasted nice. Would go back again, even though I wish the coffee was stronger. Bonus: the ambience is super chill and they were giving away some really cute pride + White Label Coffee stickers the day I went."
7,white label coffee, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"In terms of atmosphere easily one of the comfiest and coziest places you can sit down for a coffee and some chilling or reading! They roast their own beans which is always a plus, and the filter coffee was good - didn't try their pastries but smelled good. Will have to revisit for sure ;)"
8,white label coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great coffee shop. The assortment of coffee is good, and the service friendly. The staff knows their stuff and will recommend something to suit your tastes. The space is really cool too, with lots of light and a cool vibe. A nice introduction the the cafe scene in Amsterdam."
9,white label coffee, 1 star ,3 months ago,"It used to be my take away coffee place until today. Sad to say that I just discovered how they are not child friendly and super rude. After a long pandemie break, it is was the first time we stayed to enjoy our coffees. It was very obvious …"
10,white label coffee, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Coffee is great, no complaints there. Unfortunately, not accessible for people with mobility issues as the place is full of steps and no place to hold while going up and down. Only a few seats on the ground floor. Another thing is that it …"
11,white label coffee, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,HERE I TRIED THE WORST COFFE IN MY LIFE. I AM ITALIAN. IF PEOPLE PUT A COFFEE IN A CAPPUCCINO CUP MEANS THEY DON’T WHAT THEY ARE DOING. DON’T TRY TO RE-INVENT A CULTURE THAT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.
12,white label coffee, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is nice and it also has nice decoration. Somehow i feel it's a little bit hippy
The barista was not really explaining the coffee taste note because i was …"
13,white label coffee, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I liked the brazilkian coffee because it was not too strong, so it depends on how you like your coffee :)

14,white label coffee, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"After an initial glitch, online ordering is working well. Still the same great coffee. …"
15,white label coffee, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice place, but no wifi - not the best study space, since there are only small tables and comps aren't really allowed. Would recommend as a place to chat with friends."
16,white label coffee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A coffee place screaming hipster all over it. Kind baristas. Many people studying. Rwanda-coko was a pleasant cup of light, round coffee."

18,white label coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place serves excellent coffee and has a great ambience. Aim to go late afternoon in the week and you’ll be rewarded with a quiet spot to sit, on comfy seating to enjoy your coffee."
19,white label coffee, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Best café in town! I love the environment, the style, the service & the great coffee! Thanks, guys <3"
20,white label coffee, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely coffee place with a relaxed atmosphere and very kind staff. Espresso was a bit too watery for my liking, but great flavour. The gluten-free choc chip cookies right out of the oven were a great treat! Also conveniently located right in front of bus/tram stop."
21,white label coffee, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Funky coffee bar, they got several barista awards for their coffee. Can get a bit crowded (cause of the small size) but when you found a spot it's great."
22,white label coffee, 1 star ,6 months ago,i totally love their coffees. they roast everything themselves and they do this in a sublime way. the staff is crazy good and funny and pretty and they really know their coffees and have skills. the music is good. sometimes a bit on the …
23,white label coffee, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Very hippstery place - could have been copy-pasted from a Berlin street-corner. They have a wide selection of different coffees and ways of preparing them and roast in house. They also inform you on the menu that their roast and way of …
24,white label coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Simply the best coffee you can have in Amsterdam.  Nice environment and they’re cool if you bring your laptop.
25,white label coffee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The coffee: Pending review. Need a second or third visit. The grind is generally more coarse and darker. The brew has a lower ratio but is mellow. …
26,white label coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best coffees in Amsterdam! Nice fat aroma rich coffee. Best capochino's ever!
27,white label coffee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very unique seating layout with a cozy atmosphere. Great to just hang out or get some work done. The coffee is really good too and reasonably priced.
28,white label coffee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"This is the place for the morning coffee in this neighborhood.
Friendly staff, GREAT coffee and best of all 'les croissants au chocolat' ... all together gives you good energy to start your day with a smile."
29,white label coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was asking for the cold brew but they didn’t have it. Therefore they offered me Ethiopia Iced, and that was great. The coffee was absolutely amazing and staffs were friendly. I highly recommend this cafe!!!"
30,white label coffee, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Interesting coffee but unfortunately no laptops allowed. Also, we missed the Chai tea on the menu!"

34,white label coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best coffee in town and with a decent kick(they tend to do double shots)
Added bonus: free water which is hard to find in Amsterdam"
35,white label coffee, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I’d say it’s a nice place for chatting with friends, but not really suitable for doing some work/study. I understand it was built for coffee, not work, coffee is decent here. I like many coffee options they have for sale though and I’d definitely recommend it☕️"
36,white label coffee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very nice atmosphere and good third wave coffee.
37,white label coffee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best coffee! Best atmosphere! Delicious cookies and cakes. And an exeptionally weird setting you got to adore!
38,white label coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I when lived in the neighborhood I used to come to this café quite often. I can safely say that they have one of the best coffees in town. I love their oat cappuccino.
39,white label coffee, 1 star ,a year ago,"Coffee was great. Unfortunately, there's no wifi. Worse: I setup a hotspot to use my laptop, but I was told that laptops are not allowed. Very good coffee and atmosphere, but very disappointed otherwise. The store should advertise that laptops aren't allowed in the front and in bold, so customers aren't misled."
40,white label coffee, 1 star ,a year ago,"Nice spot but the coffee is simply awful and way too expensive. Acid flavour, undrinkable. I was impressed by the ritual the barman did while preparing my espresso: weighing the coffee powder, throwing away those extra grams, pressing 3 times with special tools...but the result. Bleh."
41,white label coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this place. I pop in every now and then to do work and there is no judgment for having a laptop with you (in fact, I'm here right now and putting off said work by writing this review). The staff are so friendly, always service with a …"
42,white label coffee, 1 star ,a year ago,"Before Corona this was a nice place to study, computer with headphones, nice atmosphere with others doing the same. Now, it is not allowed to bring your computer any more :-( The music is soo loud, what can you do : talk? read? Not …"

45,white label coffee, 5 stars ,8 months ago,I like how rustic this place is. Missing a few more high tables. No laptops allowed at the minute but HEY! Very friendly workers 😊 5⭐
46,white label coffee, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"One of (if not) the best coffee bean selection in town !
Whever you like it nutty or more acidic , plenty of choice. …"
47,white label coffee, 5 stars ,a month ago,One of the best espresso in town.
48,white label coffee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great coffee, stylish & cozy seating. The staff is upbeat, friendly, and knowledgable. Good selection of coffee beans to buy home. Definitely not an overstatement to name it the best cafe in the neighborhood. The layout is smartly designed …"

52,white label coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Overall still my favourite cafe in Amsterdam. Outstandingly delicious coffee, cute and relaxing place, except - omg the music is too loud! Many people come here to work but the music is like a club. Shssshh please. …"
53,white label coffee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great space - you can sit on a chair at the table, on a mat, in an armchair, on the bench, wherever that makes you happy. Good quality specialty coffee, I only had their filter options and my favourite was a natural Brazil - just what you …"
54,white label coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This was one of the most hjpster places I visited while in the Netherlands. Service was friendly and I was served great coffee. What more could I ask for? …
55,white label coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Friendly staff and nice coffee to wake me up in the morning :).
56,white label coffee, 1 star ,3 years ago,The vibe and atmosphere is quite good on the cafe but NO PLACE for electricity plug at all except on the counter. …
57,white label coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,i love their cappuccino from honey-processed beans
58,white label coffee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I’ve recently visited whitelabel coffee and I have to say that this is one of the greatest places to drink some specialty coffee in Amsterdam. I drank a V60 Natural Geisha from Ethiopia and a Nicaragua Espresso shot. Both coffees tasted …
59,white label coffee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing coffee selection! These guys know what they are doing. Fresh roasted beans, single origin, great variety of flavors, and clear seperation between beans roasted for aeropress/drip and those used in Espresso machines. So far I didn't …"
60,white label coffee, 1 star ,3 years ago,What a waste of what could be a nice work/coffee/meeting place! They have made sure you can't work from here by removing all access to electrical power outlets. The only nice thing about this place is a tiny tea-room like seating place …
61,white label coffee, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Sublime coffee! Good location on the Jan Eef. Great atmosphere, though not many seating options available inside. The coffee never disappoints!"
62,white label coffee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice, relaxed atmosphere. Good coffee also!"
63,white label coffee, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Elmer, Francesco and staff have got things right. A relaxed, friendly vibe, excellent coffee in a unique space. It's been great to see the business grow deservedly. My favourite coffee stop in Amsterdam."

65,white label coffee, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Good coffee and tasty pastry variety.
66,white label coffee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Beautiful, well-decorated, bright venue with unusual and varied seating options. Ideal for working with a laptop (fast Wifi). You can even pay with Bitcoin! I don't know much about coffee but the soy half white and the cold brew that I ordered were both great."
67,white label coffee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great coffee, good pastries and such. Bizarre but interesting layout, and a hipster atmosphere that will either turn you off or make you feel right at home depending on how you feel about hipsters. Lots of space to plugin and do some work on your laptop."
68,white label coffee, 2 stars ,a year ago,It's a nice café but after coming here a few times I can say that the coffee is avarage and the staff seems to not care at all and is rather rude. Laptops are not allowed.
69,white label coffee, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"No power socket - if you need to work in a concentrated environment, this place is a no-go. The coffee was very mediocre for me. I had a flat white. The creative, hipster vibe is nice. Go with a friend to chat!"
70,white label coffee, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Love this place! The coffee is delicious (and they accept credit cards - this is key when you are traveling and can save your cash for groceries). My favorite though, is the pyramid-esque design. With a degree in architectural photography, …"
71,white label coffee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best coffee in town, easily. Staff are sweet and know their stuff. Great variety of self-roasted beans and they even bake their own apple cake and banana bread daily."
72,white label coffee, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good coffee but one of those annoying places where they will talk back to you in English as soon as they hear a little bit of an accent in Dutch. Maybe they think they're too cool to not show they can speak English?
73,white label coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good coffee, hence the 5 stars. The layout of the place makes it less cozy in my opinion. Still, one of the places to go and have coffee in Amsterdam. Owners are relaxed too."
74,white label coffee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"White Label is one of my favorite cafes in Amsterdam. Truly spectacular coffee, great music, yummy pastries, free wifi, plenty of cozy nooks to sit in, lots of natural light and a really cool layout. Only way they could improve is by offering some lunch options. Still, this one's a winner!"
75,white label coffee, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Love love love love this place. The only spot in town that doesn't roast their beans to death. Very flavoursome lighter-than-the-rest coffee and beans to buy. Especially for V60. Super dog friendly too.
76,white label coffee, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Some of the best coffee in Amsterdam. Dynamite soft brew as well as espresso. Excellent fresh beans. Great atmosphere inside and really passionate staff.

79,white label coffee, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Coffee is a bit too bitter for me. However they have oat milk for cappuccino and free WiFi. A lot of people with laptops, no tourists. Very relaxed atmosphere"
80,white label coffee, 1 star ,3 years ago,There are no places to plug in your computer! I unplugged a lamp near the window where there was a ton of natural light and a guy that worked there just came and unplugged my computer saying they needed more light while the sun was shining …

84,white label coffee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Good alternative shop if you want a good expresso. I believe it's a bit overpriced, but it has an alternative concept and delivers a real coffee experience. Overall it's worth visiting. I couldn't help to take some beans for myself."

91,white label coffee, 1 star ,a year ago,Much hype about nothing. Avarge coffee and on top super arrogant and unpleasant stuff. Laptop rule (under no circumstances turn it on) doesn't add.
92,white label coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"the coffee is insanely good, staff is lovely, only downside is that there are no electric sockets where you could plug your computer"
93,white label coffee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This is the nicest coffee bar in Amsterdam imo. Super nice personnel and the place itself is really beautiful. Also the people who work here definitely know coffee!

103,white label coffee, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Overrated place. This is the first coffee place that won’t allow you to use any plugs, which is weird cause people usually go there to get some work done. You can’t pay in cash. The staff is friendly though"
104,white label coffee, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"I was enlightened and inspired by the higher floors and maximum score is what I give, I like to live, and live to give. Filter coffee is the best, the rest is last, white label is first, to quench your thirst drink water too. Water is blue. And so are you. Dooptidoo."

112,white label coffee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great coffee. If you are into getting the right flavour out of a coffee bean, this is the place to be. If you are used to italian coffee you would either be surprised or disapointed."
