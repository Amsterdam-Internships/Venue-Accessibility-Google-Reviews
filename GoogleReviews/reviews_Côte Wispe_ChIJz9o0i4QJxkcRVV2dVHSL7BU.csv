0,C√¥te Wispe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really high quality food served here and you can tell they are really engaging with their customers. The salmon steak is a must-try! The restaurant also has a really nice vibe and you can sit outside with cuisine and blanket while looking at the Amstel river.

2,C√¥te Wispe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I was looking for a Spanish restaurant that it used to be in this location before and found it was replaced by this one. It's totally renovated, not very long menu but everything looked great and tasted even better. It looks very good for having just some drinks too. The staff was very very nice."
3,C√¥te Wispe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good little spot.
