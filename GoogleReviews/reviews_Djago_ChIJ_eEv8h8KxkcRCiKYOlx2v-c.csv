0,Djago, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Great Indonesian restaurant. The staff is very friendly and the food was great. The menu is difficult to understand, we decided to have 2x rice tables and the food was good! Loved the taste of all the Indonesian dishes. The portions might be a little to small for sharing with two."
1,Djago, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We were lucky enough to get the last table here during a rather rainy day during an exhibition. It's not a fancy place, but the food and service was good, with fair prices. The menu is only in Indonesian, with English ""explanations"" on a â€¦"

12,Djago, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"if you are unfamiliar with indonesion food, you may like this. if you want it fresh, tasty and served in a pleasant setting, go to just about any other indonesian restaurant in area.  listless, near-spoiled, bland and served with utter complacency bordering on rudeness. did i mention overpriced?"
13,Djago, 4 stars ,8 years ago,the food is excellent and for that it would deserve five stars. However the service is a bit hit and miss; sometimes fine but at times its a trainwreck. Atmosphere and interior is ok but not great.
