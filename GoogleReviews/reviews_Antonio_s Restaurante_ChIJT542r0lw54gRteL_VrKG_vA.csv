265,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,a year ago,This place is absurdly delicious. The mushroom app is out of this world and I literally haven’t had anything that wasn’t impressively good. They don’t mess around at Antonio’s. It’s also an extraordinary value as the prices are affordable.
266,Antonio's Restaurante, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I like it here. The food is great, super fun atmosphere downstairs, but the service is just odd. Plan on having to explain orders three times, or ask for refills, just lower expectations for competency. The food is worth the forced smile."
267,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,a year ago,I would like to share what a wonderful experience I had at your restaurant. My server Alberto was very knowledgeable with menu and provided excellent service thank you for a wonderful dining experience
268,Antonio's Restaurante, 1 star ,4 years ago,We decided to eat downstairs for the first time.  I asked them if my daughter could have the sauce they serve upstairs because the pomadoro sauce that they serve downstairs has carrots and my child is allergic.  They could care less.  They …

273,Antonio's Restaurante, 1 star ,6 years ago,I gave this place three chances before deciding to write a review.  They have formal dining upstairs and informal downstairs. Downstairs has a store as well that sells Italian foods.  The first time we ate upstairs.  We were greeted by a …
274,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I've been visiting Antonio's for lunch for quite a while now and every time it's a delight! Truthfully, I tend to order the same thing each time I'm there: the grilled salmon. The reason being is that it's probably the best salmon that I …"

284,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The meal was delicious. I had the chicken cutlet parmesan and my husband had the veal chop.  The only thing this Italian girl would change is the Italian bread. Italian bread should be soft.  Antonio's Italian bread was much too hard and crunchy.  The service was outstanding.

295,Antonio's Restaurante, 1 star ,5 years ago,My family and I ate there Wednesday June 15th upstairs. Food was okay service not so much. Also noticed for the second time in a row that we ate upstairs that additional items NOT ordered showed up on the bill. All items ordered were on the …
296,Antonio's Restaurante, 1 star ,7 years ago,This place has one plan in mind........and that is making money.  The lack of customer service and etiquette was unreal.  This is coming from a business owner and professional in the community attempting to schedule a holiday party. …
297,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"While the upstairs dining room is wonderful, I prefer the relaxed environment downstairs nestled in between the wine and grocery aisles. I am there weekly! If you enjoy wine, but dont know much about it, ask David; Antonio's own wine-guru. Just tell him what you like and dont like and he'll find you something wonderful."
298,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,a year ago,This was a amazing evening we celebrated my birthday. The food was amazing and the Waiter was so imforative and patient with us thank you again for a amazing evening

303,Antonio's Restaurante, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a business luncheon and my salad consisted of wilted lettuce and frozen tomatoes. It came with blue cheese dressing, I asked for Italian dressing and was told they did not have any. Quite odd that an Italian restaurant wouldn’t have Italian dressing. Entree was good but not great."
304,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Go to Antonios upstairs for the most delicious calamari you'll ever have. Melt in your mouth tender, brought in fresh daily. We've tried the clams & linguini, the salad w salmon, the ragu w short ribs, & more, but our very favorite dish is …"

306,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I’ve lived in Winter Park my whole life and just ate at Antonio’s for the first time. The food was incredible although the clientele was a little long in the tooth. I ordered the ribeye, it was perfect. For desert I had gelato, again, perfection. I give this place a full throated five stars!"
307,Antonio's Restaurante, 1 star ,a year ago,I would put zero stars but I can’t find that feature.  The host was the most awful condescending person I have ever had the displeasure of speaking to.  Too bad.  We spend plenty of $ and have at least 10 whenever we go out and have lost of family and friends in Orlando.  I do not recommend this place.
308,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Service and food were outstanding. The swordfish special was a symphony of flavors masterfully crafted. Our waiter was fabulous and attentive.

313,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and service. Casual atmosphere, pick a bottle of wine off the menu or shelf. Store has many food items for sale."

315,Antonio's Restaurante, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Reliably good Italian food and a great staff. The coconut bombe cake for dessert is a stand-out. And the foods available in the market are unique hard-to-find items. The closest thing to a true Italian grocery in Orlando that I have found.
316,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Food and service were both excellent!
317,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food is hot and fabulous and the only thing better is the service and smiles of the staff.  Simply put:  great food and great people equates to a great experience.  It's our favorite place to eat.

320,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great family owned operation and enjoy eating both upstairs and downstairs. More of a casual feel downstairs with a simpler menu and upstairs being a bit more upscale. Amazing food that never disappoints
321,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Have beeen going here for years.  Always great dining and consistently so.   Casual dine downstairs, upscale upstairs.   Had the swordfish tonight and it was awesome, service also grear!  Parking can be a challenge at times."

325,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent food and great atmosphere.  The prices are reasonable and the food is fresh.  I'm not sure why anyone would ever go to a chain Italian restaurant when Antonio's Cafe exists.
326,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Been here a few times for dinner in the lower section of the restaurant. I'd recommend getting the pizza. The pasta is a little bit plain for the price. The coconut cake is delicious and worth the price.
327,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent restaurant upstairs and down. Service is always good and so is the food. Fish specials are to die for and shopping in the market downstairs is always fun. A must try if you have not.

332,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,All four in our party felt this was one of the finest dining experiences we have had in quite some time. All of my wife's food allergies were accommodated beautifully.
333,Antonio's Restaurante, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I usually eat downstairs because I'm there for the food not the ambiance.  The prices are a little on the high side, but it's hard to find good food. Most places cut corners on the quality of their ingredients to save money this place doesn't."
334,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love this restaurant. It is a go to for just a good meal or to celebrate a special occasion.  Always delicious food and always consistent.

344,Antonio's Restaurante, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great environment, really great spinach and sundried tomato ravioli. Salad less impressive, just greens with dressing. Gelato they offered was really subpar. It was French Vanilla, but tasted worse than Publix brand."

362,Antonio's Restaurante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Local fave.  Eat in the lower level for a cost effective meal with a retail bottle of wine from their cellar.  Great food and value.  The upper level is good but more expensive.
