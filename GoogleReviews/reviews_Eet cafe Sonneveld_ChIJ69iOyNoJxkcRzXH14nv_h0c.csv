7,Eet cafe Sonneveld, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"From all the breakfast/lunch restaurants on Gran Canaria by far the best we've visited. The chef makes high quality western food with lots of variations and the staff is very friendly. Because they only work with 2 men, it doesn't go so fast, but it's worth it :)"

75,Eet cafe Sonneveld, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food was amazing! Well done to the chefs. The waitress behind the bar was very friendly and nothing was too hard for her! But we were served/attended by 4 different waitresses in total. I feel like consistency of 1 waitress helps customers ‚Ä¶

78,Eet cafe Sonneveld, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Our tour guide had recommended it for typical Dutch food. The way he described the Stampenpot, I was expecting a large plateful of hearty food. When it arrived , I would describe the portion as small and the flavour unexciting. My companion ‚Ä¶"
79,Eet cafe Sonneveld, 5 stars ,a year ago,Good place to sit and the Spaghetti Bolognese was great.
80,Eet cafe Sonneveld, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little Bistro with an interesting menu. We had the ribs and they were excellent, including 3 different ""dips"" for the fall-off-the-bone meat. They bring the food/drink out quickly, so you can be in and out within an hour, if that appeals to you."

97,Eet cafe Sonneveld, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Vegetarian sausages were out of stock, but the stoemp was delicious"
98,Eet cafe Sonneveld, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Bit dark and pokey. Food was average.  One member of our party liked the fact traditional Dutch good and dishes were also on offer. They seem to encourage very large tour groups in so the kitchen can get a bit overwhelmed.

132,Eet cafe Sonneveld, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Three words: goat cheese sandwich! Or, if you prefer, salad. Really, both are amazing.
