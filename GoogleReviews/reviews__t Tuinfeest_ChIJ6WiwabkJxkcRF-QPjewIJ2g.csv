2,'t Tuinfeest, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very friendly atmosphere, good snacks, big cart of drinks and beers. Welcoming and smiling crew makes the place complete."
3,'t Tuinfeest, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Cozy bar with reasonable prices, but the food is where it shines.  Massive portions, delicious and something for everyone, it's an unassuming gem in a fantastic location near the train station."

5,'t Tuinfeest, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Veggie burger! WOW WOW WOW, this has to be the best burger I have laid my taste buds on. Handmade patty with house ingredients. I highly recommend this location. Amazing staff, available sitting inside and out and a good selection of food at great prices!"
6,'t Tuinfeest, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Amazing food at a reasonable price. Nice interior with spacy windows and a good view on the canal. What to wish more for?
7,'t Tuinfeest, 1 star ,7 months ago,"So where should I begin‚Ä¶ I have been sitting here for 50 minutes and my nachos still haven‚Äôt arrived. My pink gin and lemonade took 10 min. People are getting burgers, tacos and other food faster than us while we were sitting here first."

11,'t Tuinfeest, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food here was DELICIOUS. My friends and I ordered their Angus Cheeseburgers and they were excellent. The service was perfect and the ambiance was very chill and welcoming. If you come to Amsterdam, stop by and have a burger from here!"
12,'t Tuinfeest, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to have some quality time with friends. The service was good as well as the winter cocktail that was served that night.
There are also some games to entertain yourselves with, I think it‚Äôs a great pro of this bar since it lets you get to do things with your friends you usually don‚Äôt do."
13,'t Tuinfeest, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Waiter's rudeness made us leave prior to ordering. We were there at Christmas day and I asked for non alcoholic drinks menu(s) as we were 6 people not wanting alcohol and the menus on table offered only beers, spirits and food. ‚Ä¶"

15,'t Tuinfeest, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We stopped here yesterday for a quick drink. Walked in, said hello (got nothing back from either of the 2 staff members, maybe they hadn't heard us?) and put our bags & coats down at a table in the window. ‚Ä¶"
