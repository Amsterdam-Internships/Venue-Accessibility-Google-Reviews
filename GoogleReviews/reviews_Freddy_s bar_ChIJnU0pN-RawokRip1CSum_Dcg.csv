29,Freddy's bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I loved this bar because it had its own personality. It was cool to be able to order your own food and pick it up once it was ready. The second whiskey sour I ordered wasn't so great but I'll definitely give it another try.

44,Freddy's bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Low key lit ambience with edgy decor, including trippy/bizarro video playing on some screens.
