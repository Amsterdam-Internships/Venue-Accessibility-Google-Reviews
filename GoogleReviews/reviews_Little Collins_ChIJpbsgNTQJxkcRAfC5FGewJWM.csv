0,Little Collins, 5 stars ,7 months ago,You cannot go wrong with food at Little Collins. Whoever is designing their menu - and making the food - is ace at combining flavours in wonderful ways. I always look forward to trying their new dishes
1,Little Collins, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Super nice place for lunch. Extraordinary menu with lots of smoked, pickled and fresh ingredients. The dishes are delicious, but pretty small and not too cheap. But it's worth it!"
2,Little Collins, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Amazing food! Good flavors and seasoned very well!! It was an amazing lunch!
3,Little Collins, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Delicious, Savory Brunch

If you‚Äôve got a sweet tooth and like options this may not be the place for you. ‚Ä¶"
4,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Fresh flavours and ingredients, recently expanded their brunch menu with new offerings!"
5,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a month ago,"The food is always spectacular‚Äìtheir menus change frequently and are so inventive and delicious. We went for a company brunch and Kelle and the rest of the staff took amazing care of us, and were even great with our youngest guest (a toddler of 2 years!) Cannot recommend enough."
6,Little Collins, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Michelin-star quality in a humble setting!
Every dish we ordered was packed with exquisite flavors.. from the bread to the brisket. The deserts on the other hand missed the mark somehow. A special mention to probably the cutest & lovely staff we‚Äôve come across in Amsterdam!"
7,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Amazing menu with surprising combinations of really good quality products.
The sourdough bread with butter is insanely good.
The vibe is okay, they could play some music. ‚Ä¶"
8,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a month ago,Had a really lovely dinner here. The server was great. She had some awesome recommendations and even had some great cocktail recipes up her sleeve.
9,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super delish lunch! Humble yet sophisticated menu, full of stimulating flavors. Great vegetables and super friendly service in a relax atmosphere. Looking forward to eat again some ‚Äúspiced pumpkin fritters‚Äù YUM Great relax fine dining."
10,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I wanted to try this and luckily we got a table after a trip to the park. Interesting menu. The latte was quite tasty (small but good). The grilled halloumi with guacamole, black beans (mashed), pickled onions, and corn tortillas was spicy ‚Ä¶"
11,Little Collins, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Such a great place to have a brunch in Amsterdam. The service was really good and the food is super tasty üòã. Well done guys !
12,Little Collins, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food, very friendly staff.. it was a bit busy so it took a bit longer for our food. We were told the dishes are a bit bigger than a usual starter, we didn't really have that idea, the food was rather small in our opinions. We did try ‚Ä¶"
13,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"super cool menu, nice reinterpretations of classic dishes. Good cocktails, good prices...
i would implement the indoor ventilation. After brunch you need a shower to loose the food smell."
14,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great stuff. The team was very friendly from the get-go and got us a spot at the bar - on a Sunday morning, when it was fully booked. Food was great as per usual (Omelette with 'nduja and brisket flat bread this time). Efficient service and great vibes. Biceps emoji!"
15,Little Collins, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Super delicious food! Full of flavor! They recommend 3 or 4 dishes to share between 2 people, and I think if you are really hungry, it's the right amount of food. We were not that hungry so we took 2 and the bread and it was enough! Totally recommend this place!!"
16,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"If you love a good hearty brunch but want something else then eggs benedict, go to this place! The music is a bit loud for my taste, but my oh my those dishes! Its a shared dining concept so one dish wouldnt be enough per person. For two ‚Ä¶"
17,Little Collins, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Food is very flavourful but portions are smaller and made to share making it an expensive brekkie (for two people, 3-4 dishes were recommended). ‚Ä¶"
18,Little Collins, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Don‚Äôt really get the idea of small plates or portions for a brunch place, people want to have a nice full meal for brunch. Even though we had a reservation they kicked us out after 90 mins. 3 stars only for food. 0 stars for service and concept."
19,Little Collins, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great location with really good Food. Would come back for sure. Can recommend to anyone
20,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,LOVE that such a fantastic cafe has opened in our neighbourhood ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è thank you for spreading your great coffee and food around Amsterdam! I get something different every time and I‚Äôm never disappointed. And such good coffee served mostly by Aussie baristas! Little taste of home ü•∞
21,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Sensational small plates with a bias toward middle eastern flavors and fermented ingredients. Wonderful, relaxed service. One of the best meals to be had in Amsterdam right now."
22,Little Collins, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Nice brunch place. The food was nice and tasty but it felt quite pricey as the portions were a bit small. I strongly recommend their bread and miso butter as were delicious.
23,Little Collins, 4 stars ,6 months ago,There is definitely creativity in the way the food is prepared here. Lots of experimentation with different flavors. But some combinations just didn‚Äôt do it for me. Smoked burrata in combinations with peppers and carrots in spicy tomato ‚Ä¶
24,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great menu with really surprising food combinations. Lovely and friendly staff. Also seats outside to enjoy the sun and perfect spot for people watching. Definitely will be back!
25,Little Collins, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Cappucino was ok but a bit burnt, not so good. Had a great dish with spicy butter and sucuk sausage, a tad oily though. My friend ordered the guacamole beans halloumi which was overcooked and way too salty. Good kimchi bloody mary though and friendly service."
26,Little Collins, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The food at little collins is a real delight. The team does a stellar job at combining flavours in a unique way while rejecting traditional notions of regional cuisines. They mesh traditions from all around the world to form something ‚Ä¶
27,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,Absolutely incredible Melbourne-style brunch! Coffee is on point and a creative menu (highly reccomend the Cilbir). 10/10 would go again!
28,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Really nice. 10 stars for the service! And the food was great
29,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food. I had the pumpkin waffle! Maple butter was to die for! Coffee is great and service is good. It's new.. so I do hope they will make the interior a bit warmer (no photos of that unfortunately).

34,Little Collins, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Great service and delicious food. We've been so excited to get back to Little Collins now they are open again. The food is always great and the staff are always so friendly. Highly recommend if you fancy a meal a bit more out there than your standard brunch!
35,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Funky little place, nice vibe, great drinks and good food. Some dishes seem to be a bit 'trying-to-hard' to be hip but they are yummy anyways."

40,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Ok brunch, interesting local place with decent food and ok service.   I had a pastrami wafgle with an egg on top which was interesting and tasted good"
41,Little Collins, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Very disappointed with the new ‚Äòsharing‚Äô menu.
In particular, the ‚Äòpeach‚Äô salad is just nothing. 4 peach slices and too much acidity in the plate. Very wet too. ‚Ä¶"
42,Little Collins, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Little Collins is a very nice and cozy place
I went there for breakfast and I ordered a Khachapuri and a Bloody Mary
Since the Georgian Khachapuri is loaded with cheese, I expected their Khachapuri ‚Ä¶"
43,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,Insanely good. Atmosphere and staff are very friendly. Fresh food and very fast. Go early.
44,Little Collins, 1 star ,4 months ago,"We waited for almost an hour for our food to arrive and when it did it was fairly average, TINY portions (even for a tapas restaurant) and quite overpriced."
45,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I really enjoyed the breakfast menu here. The food was excellent and great service!
46,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of my favourite brunch spots in Amsterdam. Not only are the food and coffee delicious, but the service is super friendly and attentive. Special shout outs to whoever is on music duty, because the tunes are always great."
47,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a week ago,Best coffee in town ‚ù§Ô∏è
48,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of top brunch spots in Amsterdam. Highly recommended. Get the okonomiyaki.
49,Little Collins, 1 star ,5 months ago,Did not serve at all. 3 staffs were going an instagram foto 10 min in the street but were  not work ((( and not good smell in the hall
50,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to be. Amazing food, amazing Bloody Mary and outstanding staff!! Definitely we will be back. My girlfriend and I went for brunch on Sunday (I suggest to book as they were super busy) and luckily we found a spot a the bar. We ‚Ä¶"
51,Little Collins, 1 star ,a year ago,"Bland bread... I had the French toast, it was a big portion but it had no egg soaked into it and No sugar. It was a big wedge of sourdough bread 8cm cubed. As there was no sweetness, the other flavours were wasted, the figs were just soft ‚Ä¶"
52,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious brunch and it was really lovely to have such warm and welcoming customer service. Staff were attentive and it really adds to your experience. We had the pastrami waffle and a dish with poached eggs, ricotta and sausage. Epic food!"
53,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Always amazing coffee and great service. Well priced food, a must do for Amsterdam!"
54,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Little Collins West is as great as the one in de Pijp. Not disappointed and always good time there with excellent food and vibes. Staffs couldn‚Äôt be more friendly.
55,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Little Collins doesn't just serve up one of the best brunch options in Amsterdam, its evening menu is also very exciting. All plates are set up to share with a group of friends, or dining as a couple. One starter and three main dishes as recommend by the staff was plenty! Try the pumpkin fritters, and stewed goat. Lekker!"
56,Little Collins, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Amazing food and super friendly staff!

57,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My review wouldn‚Äôt make justice to either the food or the service or the overall atmosphere: they‚Äôre all great. Perfect place for an early weekend booze brunch üò¨. The staff is always welcoming and smiling. We are regulars, what can I say!"
58,Little Collins, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"""Very tasty food and little cute terrace
I absolutely loved the food at Little Collins: the little chickpea flour dumpling were like little clouds of tastiness and we had a lovely bread with zat‚Äôar. ‚Ä¶"
59,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Probably my favourite place in Amsterdam. Awesome food and flavours with unusual combinations that keep your taste buds dancing! Yeah, I like it.

60,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Oh my god - wow. I was truly floored by the exceptional cuisine. The food was absolutely mouthwatering and delicious. I expected a good meal, and I got an exceptional one. I highly, highly recommend this place as one of the best brunches I've ever had in my life."
61,Little Collins, 2 stars ,10 months ago,"Don't order the ""Kimchi Toast""...  It was really bad, we ordered it and returned immediately. Couple next to us also ordered and couldn't eat it. ‚Ä¶"
62,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had an amazing brunch here! The service was super friendly and the menu had really interesting and yummy sounding options.  The food was delicious and well prepared!  We'll definitely be back :)

67,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,"very good brunch! the sourdough is perfect. overall it may be a little overpriced, but the lovely service had me coming back three days in a row :)"
68,Little Collins, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Aussie-style (the best!) cafe with interesting brunch options. Much bigger than their De Pijp location and different menu. Several gluten-free, vegan and veggie options, including gluten-free bread (1.50 extra) and dairy-free milk options. Can book (for now) too!"
69,Little Collins, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"First off, service was great! I can‚Äôt say the same for the food though. I ordered the Guasaca for 13 euros. What a disappointment. It was basically a spoonful of guacamole, black beans, 3 corn tortillas, and a tiny few bits of onion/parsley ‚Ä¶"
70,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great variety of very special dishes with clear middle eastern flavors. Service was great, albeit a bit slow due to the places obvious popularity. Only downside was mediocre coffee :)"
71,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Brunch was great, menu has options for everyone. Went for the Kimchi & Gruyere pocket with bacon on top. Was super tasty! This great brunch place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Place was packed, so make sure to reserve!"
72,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very tasty and inspired brunch dishes!
73,Little Collins, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We asked what the concept ""to share"" meant on the menu. The waitress said: you dont h√°ve to share but the portions are very big. (Around 15 euro per dish) We ordered then 2 dishes and were expecting a lot! Quality and quantity wise. Instead ‚Ä¶"

76,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tonight my wife and I walked by and were curious what was new. We had a great meal with wonderul flavours and healthy ingredi√´nts. We shared the various dishes and were positively surprised! Not just by te food, but also by the super friendly and welcoming staff. Highly recommended and we will definately return!"
77,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great coffee, great (and unique) food, friendly service (lots of Aussies, so makes sense *wink*). Love having a little taste of Melbourne life while living in my home away from home that is Amsterdam. High recommend. Check out the uber cool Oud West neighbourhood while you're around the place."
78,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome espresso. Interesting and delicious food options.
79,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and excellent service, fresh juices are top notch. On a Sunday visit we had to wait for about 20 minutes to get a table but it was definitely worth a little wait. I am going to try out Little Collins De Pijp next."
80,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best breakfast / lunch bars to eat in Amsterdam is now also in the West! The food is  just fantastic and you will have a hard time picking just 1 meal from the menu.
81,Little Collins, 1 star ,4 months ago,Very expensive for nothing crazy ‚Ä¶ very small portion and rustic decoration !!
82,Little Collins, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I really, really loved the Little Collins in De Pijp, and I adore this one as well because the food is outrageously good and the menu is different from the typical 'breakfast' dishes with a unique spin of their own. Everything is delicious! ‚Ä¶"
83,Little Collins, 4 stars ,a year ago,Every dish on the menu tastes delicious and is very special. However i find the portions a bit too small. i was not full afterwards and i usually dont eat that much.
84,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely perfect. Starting with the friendly service, good background music, delicious food and re a lly good coffee. I will defiantly come back soon. By The way: I had the pumpkin waffle, and it's to die for."
85,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,Love the place and service. Food always has an interesting twist that makes it unique. Miss the Lemon Hollandaise eggs from last season‚Äôs menu though...
86,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Eclectic mix of dishes you wouldn‚Äôt see together on the same menu twice.
Super tasty and portions are bang on!
Staff are super helpful and friendly too"

88,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The Best menu ever. The broccoli / fetta/ filo cannot be topped . The Gnudi cannot be topped. The natural wine cannot be topped. So much casual dining / top shelf food goodness
89,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super super tasty! Get the Panacotta yogurt & granola if you want something small & sweet, go for the Kimchi Pancake or Curried eggs if you want something bigger & savoury. Both were DELISH! Will definitely go back!"
90,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The halloumi cheese in the Guasacaca is absolutely delicious, and so is the brownie. Definitely a place to go if you want to have an awesome brunch! (and you can book a table even in the week-ends)"

93,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I'm very happy Little Collins opened close to my place! I've been here already twice since the opening, nice space, welcoming staff and great food. Specially enjoyed the blody mary selection for the Sunday hungover brunch :D"
94,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely and friendly service. The food is very good. Ask the cocktail specialist to create you favourite cocktail. I can suggest the Daiquiri cocktail, it is of the menu ;)"
95,Little Collins, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"High expectations weren‚Äôt met. Australian - style brunches are supposed to be the best of the best. This place lacked vibe, and a good breakfast menu."
96,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to meet and eat. You'll always get to eat something you've never eaten before. Sausage with yoghurt. Don't go without booking

100,Little Collins, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We were waiting half an hour for someone to come and ask us what we wanted to drink, despite not being full.  The food is good, but the service is not, so you might consider not going again."

102,Little Collins, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible experience, the dishes I ordered were cooked with too much butter and oil. The dessert was awful and strong, zero sweet, and they refused to exchange it and had to pay for it."
