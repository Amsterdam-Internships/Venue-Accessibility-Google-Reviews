8,Utrechtsedwarstafel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wonderful, friendly service from staff and owners who clearly knew their stuff.

A worthwhile, long experience (we sat at the table for over 4 hours)."
9,Utrechtsedwarstafel, 4 stars ,6 months ago,This is clearly a very fancy place. You pay for what you get. So it's not cheap but food and wine are just delicious and the pairing is magistral. The owner does not about wine and really takes the time to explain what you're served and …

21,Utrechtsedwarstafel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Hans was a legend.  Great food and matched wines.  Don’t interrupt them though when they are explained  the course.  Salmon and “crispy stuff” was a winner.

25,Utrechtsedwarstafel, 1 star ,9 months ago,"The quality of the food and service received was somehow disconnected from the price we paid.

32,Utrechtsedwarstafel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This was hands down the best meal I've had in Amsterdam. Igor made an octopus salad for the starter that I could eat for the rest of my life and I don't even like octopus - or at least I thought I didn't. …
