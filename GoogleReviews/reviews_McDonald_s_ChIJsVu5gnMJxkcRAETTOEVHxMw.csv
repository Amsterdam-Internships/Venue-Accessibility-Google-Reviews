0,McDonald's, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Fast delivery through ubereats. Burgers were hot and delicious!
1,McDonald's, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Food never arrived through uber eats. Restaurant never answered the phone. They are THEIEVES, and you should DELETE UBER EATS IMMEDIATELY because they will NEVER HELP YOU. Let my issue be a lesson to you."
2,McDonald's, 5 stars ,4 months ago,I want to give this mc Donald a round of Applaus! All vegetarian doubters- this mc Donald’s know there preparation Protokoll to keep all the vegetarian options clean! Nice! Awesome! Definitely coming back!
3,McDonald's, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Macdonald's advertises the McPlant on every billboard in the city, and fails to stock enough to keep up with demand. After a very disappointing, wet walk, I give you 1 star."
4,McDonald's, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Giving one star because initially when I ate the veggie burger that has given me extreme food poisoning, I actually thought it was nice. But once the stomach pain, vomiting, headaches and cold sweats started, I changed my mind. Clearly it had some form of bacteria on it. Never getting food from here again."
5,McDonald's, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Fast. Food was good. 4/5
Thanks for staying open until late."
6,McDonald's, 2 stars ,3 months ago,Pretty dirty place. The workers were not wearing a mask while cooking or serving the food.
7,McDonald's, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The dirtiest restaurant I've ever seen. Tables are uncleaned, the air is stinky, and men are asking for money from me, inside. I have no more mood to eat."
8,McDonald's, 1 star ,a year ago,"The meal was initially given incomplete, had to correct them to give me the right order. Once i arrived home i also realized they could not even manage to give me the right sauces. Horrifying experience as my last time in this restaurant too. Worst mcdonalds in the city."
9,McDonald's, 1 star ,a year ago,Avoid! Avoid! Avoid! Go somewhere else in the area for food! The most disgusting place I’ve ever had to eat! Not a single person working was wearing a face mask! Every table was dirty! I had to wait 15mins for my order while the 9 staff …
10,McDonald's, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We ordered 2 big Veggie burgers, but when we arrived at home, we saw they put cheap cheeseburgers wit meat on them in the bag instead... When we tried to call them, they didn't pick up. …"
11,McDonald's, 1 star ,2 years ago,"It's a shame! I don't know if it's all the McDonald's in Netherlands but I live in UK and it's so much better and cheaper. I ordered a veggie burger and it was so dry and there was nothing in there : a poor veggie chicken, salad and a bit …"
12,McDonald's, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst McDonald's of my life. Not a big fan of their restaurants but I usually go few times a year as they do pretty decent food for the price in UK. Here it was really expansive (28€ for two menus) and absolutly disgusting (bland chips, dry …"

16,McDonald's, 1 star ,2 years ago,I am generally a fan of McDonald's but this is by far the worst one I have been to. I am not gonna talk about the space since I do not really sit there but I can talk about my orders and the staff. Almost always I  receive my orders with …
17,McDonald's, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Almost all of the times I've ordered there something's missing from the order. Today I ordered a diet coke among other stuff, which was half LEMONADE. They did not even bother to empty the cup and refill it. Also a medium fries missing from the order. Rude staff."
18,McDonald's, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"New digital order system is way slower than the cashier. Also last time the milkshake was basically milk, today the machine was broken so I got a warm non carbonated diet coke instead that I then mistakenly paid extra for. This is why I visit once per year 😂"
19,McDonald's, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I have ordered pretty short order, i was waiting for 25 minutes for takeaway meal, then after another 25 minutes when i was home i realise i havent received one the most expensive part of my order. When i was asking where is my order, they tried to look like they dont notice me being in front of my face."
20,McDonald's, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I do not see why this MC donalds gets a 3 star rating. Only possibility is that people are too drunk to taste the food. Burger was horrible, meat was hard and tasted like it had been cooking in the sun for a day. Fries were more yellow than …"
21,McDonald's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Standarded like all MC , we only buy coffe here, but I can say there are kind attendants and good coffe when you are in a expensive city,  for who is addicted like me, its a good solution, cheap and good, not amazying but good American …"
22,McDonald's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fast service, decent food. You get what you pay for, though it is quite nice no matter what you order. Food doesn't fill you for more than 3 or 4 hours, like any McDonald's."
23,McDonald's, 1 star ,a year ago,"So Rude! They gave me veggie nuggets with a half eaten one in there, I showed the girl at the counter and she laughed, said she would give me a different one, pretty sure she just gave me back the same ones and there was also another quarter bit of a nugget in there, will never go there again, disgusting behaviour"
24,McDonald's, 2 stars ,9 months ago,This is the slowest mcdonalds I have ever been to. How they are still operating is beyond me.
25,McDonald's, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I want to report a very bad behavior of the stuff in one  of your Mc Donald's Swindenstraat.

26,McDonald's, 1 star ,a year ago,"They always get the order wrong: wrong sauces, drink forgotten, no salad, very long waiting time. Incompetent!"
27,McDonald's, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the worst McDonald's I've been to. Really, I don't have high standards when it comes to this restaurant, but oh god I've not seen one so dirty and unorganised in Europe as this one. Appalling"
28,McDonald's, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The restaurant is always dirty, I have never seen staff clean the tables.
Multiple times missing items from my order.
4/10 would only eat when I have too"
29,McDonald's, 1 star ,2 years ago,Extremely long wait and when we got our burgers they were stale. It was almost like the burgers had been sitting there all day before serving them to us at around midnight.
30,McDonald's, 2 stars ,a year ago,It's slowest McDonald of the world. 3 customers 20 Min waiting. For the rest just McDonald.
31,McDonald's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely service, a bit slower than what I'm used to but it's just a few seconds to a minute max so that's not a minus in my book. Keep it up"
32,McDonald's, 2 stars ,a year ago,"I went at 1am and they really don't pay attention to the ""McDonald's quality"" but maybe they were tired"

34,McDonald's, 1 star ,5 months ago,Bad service long waiting.
35,McDonald's, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food is the same as any other McDonald's. The place is small old and not comfortable. It's not even possible to close the door, in Amsterdam in the winter this is a problem."
36,McDonald's, 3 stars ,a year ago,"It's just another McDonald's, however it's located at the Dapper Markt, so a visit to the market is always enjoyable."

45,McDonald's, 1 star ,2 years ago,Depressed and depressing. Remember when going to McDonald's used to be exciting and modern? You feel embarrassed  to be there whilst an institution dies.
46,McDonald's, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst McDonald’s of Amsterdam, took more than 30 min to get our food. They didn’t seem to care about our order. Tip don’t order one big order do 2 smaller orders."
