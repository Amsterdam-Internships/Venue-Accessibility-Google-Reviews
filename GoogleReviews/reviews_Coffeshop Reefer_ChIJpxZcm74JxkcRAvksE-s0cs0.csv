2,Coffeshop Reefer, 4 stars ,a year ago,Decent enough. Can get better weed in england than you can in dam. Cheaper too. The view outside the shop is agood one.
3,Coffeshop Reefer, 5 stars ,a month ago,staff were slow and probably stoned lol but the Coco loco smoothy was amazing and the space cake messed me up big time
4,Coffeshop Reefer, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Chill coffee shop with a nice choice of music. Hip hop vibes. Has a pretty cool upstairs lounge area.
5,Coffeshop Reefer, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It's okay. I wasn't won over by staff at the bud bar, I can't comment on the staff at the juice bar as I didnt get the chance to chat with them. Not that anyone was unpleasant but simply just didn't seem as upbeat and sociable as other budtenders. Toilets need attention. Other than that it was a nice enough atmosphere."
6,Coffeshop Reefer, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very Bad service and honestly cons woman was rude didn't explain or show strains. We bought a drink and had to inspect the smoke ourselves we decided we wanted a refund so requested it in ALL OTHER shops the dispenser had stated it was no ‚Ä¶

9,Coffeshop Reefer, 4 stars ,4 years ago,One of the few coffee shops that I visited in Amsterdam that allowed you to buy and consume on the location. It is located right next to the canal and has nice seating. It is on the small side so does get packed quickly. This is also one of ‚Ä¶

Thanks guys."
12,Coffeshop Reefer, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Not a bad coffeeshop by any means, the positives are the staff are friendly and informative, the products are reasonably priced especially for the location, however the chairs in the upper smoking area were in a right state when I visited, bare cushion with the leather ripped off and the music often got way to loud up there."
13,Coffeshop Reefer, 1 star ,3 years ago,The barman was rather rude and aggressive. He asked for my ID. When I offered to show him a picture of my ID he declined it saying that's not accepted. The rest of my girlfriends who are also under 25 were allowed in. Rather unfair and ‚Ä¶
