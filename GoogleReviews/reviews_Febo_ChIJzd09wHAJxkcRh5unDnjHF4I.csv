0,Febo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It is a very nice place to visit when in Amsterdam. It is a tradicional fast food from Holand. They have some snacks as self service but you can order soda, juices and hamburgers. It is fast and a nice price. The neighboorhood is beautiful. They have many options of drinks and snacks. I think It is worthy."
