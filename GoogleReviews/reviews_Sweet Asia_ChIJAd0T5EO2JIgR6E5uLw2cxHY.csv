2,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,a month ago,"$10 soup isn't cut up or anything. Just big pieces of broccoli, beef shrimp in a container full of water. Are you kidding me?"
3,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,a year ago,"Total waste of money and time, the food came out to 53.29, and I waited for over an hour and a half! When I called the girl did not greet me right, she just picked up and said hello. The shrim w broccoli and pork fried rice had only 5 ‚Ä¶"
4,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"I love their house special lo mein, almond chicken and lobster fried rice."
5,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,5 months ago,My go to for delicious Chinese food. Everything I order is hot and has a lot of flavor. I especially like the salmon or lobster fried rice. And the veggie delight is delicious as well. These are my favorites but everything I've ever tried has been good
6,Sweet Asia, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"The  my sushi was warm bc they put it in the same bag as the hot items. Warm, raw tuna, gross. The veggie roll had a huge chunk of avocado (see pic). It didnt taste right either, no flavor. I spent $25 and couldnt eat Maybe their other dishes are better? Staff was neutral. Good luck"
7,Sweet Asia, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Not bad sushi for a place that does mostly Chinese along with different noodle dishes. On my way home Twice a week, I had to try. Got a pint of shrimp lomein to eat tomorrow, but had to taste it tonight since there was enough for 2.5 meals ‚Ä¶"
8,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Ordered online today. First time ordering here. I had an easy time ordering online and my food was ready when I arrived. Staff was friendly, food was yummy. I'll be back. Also, they put so many wontons in my wonton soup :)"
9,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Whenever I've ordered from this Cafe, it always arrives close to if not before the time allotted, and my food is always hot, and delicious."
10,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,a year ago,PLEASE DO NOT EAT AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!  The quality of the food has went down. I found a DEAD BUG in my food!  I called Sweet Asia to get a refund which they not did give me one. They said it wasn't a bug in my food. My husband had the ‚Ä¶
11,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Terrible and overpriced. Sushi rice was too sweet, fake gross crab and Salman was overcooked. This place is a total joke and looks like cafeteria food. Not to mention I looked through the replies and the owner is an insufferable @$$hole."
12,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Do NOT go here.  This place is not clean and the guy who makes the sushi is very rude and nasty.  Before he made my sushi, he cleaned the counter with gloves on and tried to make my sushi with the same dirty gloves.  I asked him to change his gloves and he got mad and gave me back my money."
13,Sweet Asia, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good food. People were nice. We ordered chicken with garlic sauce and almond chicken. Crab Rangoon were very tasty.
14,Sweet Asia, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Love the freshness of the food. But the shrimp are smaller now (maybe trying to save money during pandemic), which was disappointing, and the only reason I didn‚Äôt give a 5-rating. But if you‚Äôre looking for fresh, authentic, flavorful Chinese food ‚Äîyou will be pleased."
15,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,a year ago,If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would. My daughter tried to place an order with them and they said card was decline. My daughter is mentally ill...she had me to order because she couldn't understand what was going. I order online ‚Ä¶
16,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,a year ago,"Food never came. Ordered online yesterday. No one called to let me know my order was delivered. I even put ""call upon arrival"" in the instructions. I shouldn't have to do that. After waiting for 20 minutes after food was scheduled to arrive ‚Ä¶"
17,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I LIVE 30 MINUTES AWAY AND IT IS WORTH THE DRIVE.  Food is great, not greasy, taste fresh, They let you substitute with out charging whoever takes your order always gets it right the first time and will repeat it to you before you pay and they have FRESH MADE SUSHI.  THIS IS MY SECRET PLACE, DONT TELL BAD PEOPLE ABOUT MY PLACE."
18,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,3 months ago,amazing food and omg the lady who worked there was beyond friendly.
19,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Excellent food and generous quantity for reasonable prices! Thumbs up!
20,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,a year ago,Shrimp fried rice contained peas carratos corn and string beans. Rice was not fried but simple drowned in soy sauce. The white rice that came with seafood combination was sticky and gooey. The combination it self was slimey and the veggies were uncooked!! Throw it out!! Wasted over 40$ will never order from there again! Thank you
21,Sweet Asia, 2 stars ,3 weeks ago,Mediocre rice came with no meat at all and pepper steak was beige
22,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Almond boneless chicken my go to anytime of the day. The best hands down!
23,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,a year ago,"For starters, it's far as local Asian food goes, there's just is not even up to par....check out some of the lo al favorites in Oak Park or Farmington if want actual good food.  I work nearby so I used to order here from time to time. ‚Ä¶"
24,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,4 years ago,THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE NO FRESH SUSHI WATERY AND TASTELESS  AND THEY WOULD NOT TAKE THE SUSHI BACK ..THEY GRIND UP SALMON AND MIX IT VERY OLD... AND HE WAS VERY RUDE AND NONCHALANT  ...THEY HAD TO GIVE THEIR OWN REVIEWS...I SHOULD HAVE ‚Ä¶
25,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was wonderful. Huge portions of sweet and sour combo dinners. Enough for two or three meals - for tomorrow night and maybe even the next night! We buy extra egg rolls to go with those extra meals.
Restaurant staff very nice and helpful."
26,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,6 months ago,"I was trying to place an order and you
Could not understand English and to my surprise you told me to go order somewhere else. How rude!! I WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. MAYBE YOU NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL TO LEARN ENGLISH!!!"
27,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The server acted like she couldn't be bothered, and barely spoke loud enough, so I kept having to ask her to repeat herself.
I ordered two basic sushi rolls and one signature. They were disgusting! ‚Ä¶"
28,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I love Sweet Asia Cafe! My girlfriend and I eat here all the time. On our last visit, our meal wasn't as good as all the others but I guess they were just having an off day...? Either way, the employees are polite, the restaurant is always ‚Ä¶"
29,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I ordered online and called over an hour later to get a delivery estimate.  For whatever reason, the order hadn't gone through.  The person I spoke with apologized profusely (which is becoming more and more rare and was very refreshing to ‚Ä¶"
30,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,a year ago,Very disappointed! Either a new cook or a new owner. Ordered almond chicken and vegetables rice. The chicken pieces were cooked very hard or just old and cut into tiny pieces. The vegetable rice is not what it use to be and the brown gravy is disgusting taste!
31,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,a year ago,I canceled my order LITERALLY 40 seconds after I called to place it for the show white roll and was told NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN because they started making it!!! I‚Äôm confused what part of the game that is but they need a better ‚Ä¶
32,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I absolutely love this place. Their food is never weighted down with grease like some places that I have patronized with the same type of food. The prices are a little high though. Its always clean. The young man is pretty quiet,  but he is nice. I would recommend this place."
33,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Ordered the Pepper Steak Combo..... (Light Onions & Bell Peppers) Extra Steak......THATS EXACTLY WHAT I GOT!!!!üëçüëç... My friend ordered Almond Boneless Chickenüëç. Normally places still give me a ton of vegetables!!! This place followed instructions!!!‚ò∫ The taste was also Delicious!!!! Will be going back!!!!
34,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,a year ago,"Horrible customer service! The owner / manager is the rudest person I‚Äôve ever met! His attitude is awful, and he‚Äôs beyond mean...and this place gave us food poisoning... my boyfriend was up all night throwing up. I wish I would‚Äôve kept my money! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY"
35,Sweet Asia, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great take out. The dinner special is enough to split with my beautiful wife. Her impression was that the orange chicken did not meet expectations. I found it to be very tasty.
36,Sweet Asia, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was very watery and it seems they are not owning any kind of spices.
Even the basics like Salt and Pepper were missing.
After all the good reviews we were looking forward to the Meal but this wasn't a ‚Ä¶"
37,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,8 years ago,Hands down the best sushi I've ever had.  I brought my sister there today as well and she agreed.  You have a little longer wait if you order the sushi but it's well worth it.  I go here 2-3 times a week for lunch.  Very reasonably priced as well.
38,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,3 years ago,Horrible Food. Found a hair but luckily i was just about to start. They changed the plate and served a new plate. Food is tasteless. Did not like it at all. Its all about the sauce that makes Chinese and Thai taste like Thai and Chinese ‚Ä¶
39,Sweet Asia, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Get sushi from here often. Sushi is good and reasonably priced. Fried rice and wantons are also quite good, which are the other regulars. Ordering on Friday and Saturday evening can sometimes lead to long wait times, especially if you have it delivered."
40,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is my favorite local spot! I love that they have Chinese and Japanese options. I have had sushi, many chicken dishes, noodles and everything is fresh and delicious. My only complaint is no seaweed salad. But its not a big deal i still come here often"
41,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,5 years ago,not impressed! I ordered chicken and broccoli. The chicken tasted terrible!! Like it was leftover from yesterday and reheated today.  The waitress did not even ask me how my meal was. As she cleared my plate(which had all the chicken on ‚Ä¶
42,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Disgusting sushi! The worst sushi I have ever had. The salmon was old. The shrimp tempura was watery and old. Do not recommend at all. I spent over 30 dollars here cause the reviews say the food is good, but now I know that is false."
43,Sweet Asia, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very clean and tidy restaurant. A little hot but not to bad. Food had great flavor, cooked through. Fried rice was good. Best crab Rangoon i have had in a long Time! Would recommend and will go again if in the area!"
44,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"I come often and I am never disappointed. The service is amazing. The food is consistently delicious with some of the best pricing in the area as well. From their menu items to the sushi, everything is a cut above other Chinese food places. I will not stop coming here."
45,Sweet Asia, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"shrimp fried rice was dry and the gravy was not good as it used to be, over all its a nice clean place"
46,Sweet Asia, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very disappointing these people need to learn how to talk to their customers they need training and customer service You're not supposed to act like it's just all about the money, treating the customer with respect, no one likes that hurry ‚Ä¶"
47,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This has to be the rudest place I have ever been to.
Just last week I and my wife ordered Egg Foo Young, and she doesn't eat the egg. So they made it just as she requested. ‚Ä¶"
48,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very clean and they use gloves when handling food. Staff are very friendly. Veggies are fresh. Food is delicious! Nice atmosphere. Price is good and portions large.
49,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,3 years ago,I was really bummed out that as me and my co-workers were being seated that we saw a woman and her son arguing with the man behind the counter about being charged a dollar per person more for dining in the restaurant.  The man said that the ‚Ä¶
50,Sweet Asia, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Sesame Chicken... I've had better nothing to brag about. Service was great.  For a $12 Dinner combo. I expected better. Was small chopped pieces of chicken with a lot of breading.  Fried rice was really good though.
51,Sweet Asia, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"It'll do in a pinch but really the food is not that good. I work nearby and there's not a ton of places to eat. Over the last 8 years, after some amount of time has elapsed I will forget that the food isn't very good and I'll go back and ‚Ä¶"
52,Sweet Asia, 3 stars ,5 years ago,This place is OK. I had a Chinese entree once and sushi another time. The general tso chicken lunch was great. But I wouldn't order sushi again. The presentation of the sushi was not good at all and although it was a cold menu item it came ‚Ä¶
53,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,a year ago,I'm giving this place no stars if I could. I'm in vacation and checking out local spots but after reading the owners responses and how he talks to customers he seems very confrontational and not someone I want to put money in the pockets of. Do better learn the American way!!!!
54,Sweet Asia, 4 stars ,a year ago,i mostly order almond chicken and chicken fried rice every time i once tried to order sushi it was my first time trying it and when it arrived it looked old and bad but the almond chicken makes up for it even though sometimes the chicken ‚Ä¶
55,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,7 months ago,My grandmother ordered a orange chicken dinner today got very sick start vomiting right after she ain‚Äôt it I called he told me don‚Äôt ever order from there again in hung up I wouldn‚Äôt suggest anyone order the orange chicken from here
56,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Sushi and noodles were greatüç£üçù
57,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,9 months ago,Food was horrible and dried out then the lady who answered the phone was rude and the manager had the nerve to say don‚Äôt like the food don‚Äôt come back so at this point they need to be shut down and don‚Äôt waste your money ever going here
58,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,2 years ago,This place is horrible. And they have bugs. I would never order from this place. Also dine  in guest  are required to order at the register instead of being seated and having your order taken like a normal restaurant. Beware of this place food is also terrible and the man running the place is an  awful and disgusting racist
59,Sweet Asia, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good place for short trip. Not so welcoming, food was okay, not as good as the Thai cuisine. Place needs improvement. Mind about the spice level, Medium spice was hot for me, so don't go for hot, unless you really like and can bare spice!!"
60,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The place offers a great variety of fresh food. I enjoy dining here. Staff members are always super nice, pricing is convenient and the spot is always clean."
61,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,8 years ago,I love this restaurant and try to go whenever I have a taste for the type of food on their menu. I've tried different dishes from this restaurant and I always come back for the Sesame and General Tso chicken. I love their crab rangoon and the service is great. I actually plan on going to get some food before they close today.
62,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,4 years ago,Food is good but the owner is the rudest. He constantly refuses service to my family insisting he is too busy to take dine in orders and will only do carry out. This is my 3rd bad experience in a row. Will not be going back.
63,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I've been coming to this place since it opened about 5 years ago. All of the food choices are great with just the right touch of seasoning. The sushi is also fantastic.
64,Sweet Asia, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food is always decent. The General Tso chicken could use bigger pieces. You can eat in which is good. Prices are high in comparison to similar restaurants.
65,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,6 months ago,The worst place you can eat at .
66,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,5 years ago,For the last year or so they've been using a bait-and-switch when it comes to the prices on their menus so when you order online know that that price might be different and you won't know until they call you back and give you a much higher price for the food. In my opinion this is not good business or customer service.
67,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The food is alright but do NOT order it online. 3 times in a row I ordered through their website, waited well over an hour, called, and was told that ""their paper was out"" and that they didn't get my order. If you can't fulfill online orders, DON'T TAKE THEM. I will not be doing business with them again."
68,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,4 years ago,"So I ordered a vegetable broth soup.... man... why almost 1/2 way thru, did I find a bug on the broccoli. When I called them back to complain, the guy was nonchalant about it, like, ""yea, sometimes there are bugs in the mushrooms that are ‚Ä¶"
69,Sweet Asia, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Always great food at a reasonable price for lunch
70,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Never a bad meal. Fair prices and more than generous portions, I always recommend the place to people that are in the area. Delivery is always prompt, and food is always hot."
71,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is regularly fresh and delightful, staff members gives awesome service. I like how neat it is and ambience. Will come visit again."
72,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I avoid Chinese food, traditional or Americanized, but on a whim I tried the food at Sweet Asia Cafe and was pleasantly impressed. Good quality food, which is my typical gripe. Try the Orange Chicken, it is tasty!"
73,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,a year ago,"Worst customer service I have EVER experienced! The owner or whatever the guys name is that answers the phone is BEYOND rude! When I walked in the building, he instantly started arguing and getting loud with me! I will not be back!"
74,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,4 years ago,"This is the first time I ordered...I ordered four different things, and the only thing I like was the crab rangoon..even the fortune cookies were not fresh..The sushi is the only thing I might only order. It's ok that's what the 1üåü is for."
75,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Great food and service! There was a mix up with our delivery address and while it was not at all their fault they still delivered a delicious and warm meal and even through in two free Cokes since the delivery was late.
76,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,6 years ago,The food is really good and tasty!  Seasoned just right and the meat is very tender too. Their food reminds me of the old Stanley's Chinese Restaurant!
77,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is always fresh and delicious. The portions are really big, you get more than what you pay for. Great service."
78,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Love their Sushi Rolls and they are always friendly. I love ordering through their online advance system! One of my fav places
79,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Very bad customer service. No respect for black women.

I am no longer supporting non diverse businesses."
80,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,4 years ago,I went there with a group and asked if we could put 3 tables together so we could sit together and the manager refused. I could understand if the place was busy but there were only 2 other people eating at the front. Very unimpressed with the service. Would not recommend this place.
81,Sweet Asia, 5 stars ,a year ago,I asked for extra spice in my hunan beef and it was sooo good with the shrimp fried rice.  I will be back
82,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,2 years ago,Food is delicious but she forgot to charge me $1 to dine in. The $1 was for me using their plate. Wow!
83,Sweet Asia, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good food and friendly staff. Clean and well kept . Most locals take out their orders as did I. Good fair portions.
84,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I would not recommend this place at all. I tried to call and place an order they told me they did not have what I wanted, but I use to order the same thing every time I went there. The guy then hung up on me and told me he wouldn‚Äôt take my ‚Ä¶"
85,Sweet Asia, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good was great!!
Called in for pick up,never asked for name so when I got there the guy behind counter was confused & had no idea what I was talking about took 10 mins to figure out my order!!"
86,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,4 years ago,There was some sort of beetle in my general Tso shrimp üôÅ   The food was good as far as what I ate but I was soooo turned off after finding the bug.

96,Sweet Asia, 1 star ,2 years ago,I couldn't give them 0 or negative stars but that's what they deserve. Horrible customer service and they haven't learned yet that they aren't in business with out customers. They shouldn't be in business

98,Sweet Asia, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, Over cooked Almond boneless.  Had brown gravy +, not the worst but just average"
