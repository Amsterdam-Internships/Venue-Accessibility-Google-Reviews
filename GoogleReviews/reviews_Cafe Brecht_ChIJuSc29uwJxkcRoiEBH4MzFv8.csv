30,Cafe Brecht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff was easily approachable, there were plenty of choices, the seats were comfortable and the drinks were good.  I have my doubts about mixing vodka with milk and someone who wrote on the bathroom wall is obsessed with a dude named peter. But I loved spending time here!"
31,Cafe Brecht, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"They always have interesting German beers and good, quality cocktails here. The interior layout is a bit ""unconventional"" with lots of tattered couches and armchairs that you sink into. Though it is super cozy during less busy hours, it gets a bit cumbersome when the bar fills up. A sunny spot outside is hard to beat, though."
32,Cafe Brecht, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great drinks. Love the Bohemian, starving artist atmosphere of the place. Very casual and comfortable. Lounge seats so you can stay for awhile. They had WiFi but it went out and never came back while I was there (only annoying because I was visiting internationally so I relied on it). Recommend for sure."

Absolutely in love with this place!"
46,Cafe Brecht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely caf√©, good food and the staff are friendly. Comfy seating, cosy and quirky! We visited at lunch time so it was quiet which meant we got to have a lot of the dogs company!!! (Main reason we came back lol).
The food is nice too though."
