2,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Elegant and trendy place. The ambiance and location is very nice. Great place to start your evening with some very tasty and original cocktails.
3,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere and tasty food, but very small portions and outrageous prices. For example, a ‚Ç¨12 bottle of wine in the supermarket costs ‚Ç¨27 here (we know the brand) and whilst the gnocchi was very tasty it was not enough for the prices ‚Ä¶"
4,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The spacious inside was pretty empty on a Tuesday evening (happy hour at least) however the outdoor patio was pretty full for an unseasonably warm October evening. Very satisfying environment and menu for our group with basics such as beer, ‚Ä¶"
5,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This was an exquisit experience. I wanted to go to a special place my last night in Amsterdam and this place was on point. I loved the open kitchen and the chance to watch the staff creating delicious dishes.
6,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food , the local and atmosphere 5 stars. Service good. Beverage, ok. Little beer choises. Was a little cold. Not cheap, but not super expensive."

11,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Tourist trap. Very fancy and expensive restaurant, but the food is average and the service extremly slow and confused."

15,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic food - pity about the service. Best seafood salad I have ever had. Nice wine list. Why water can't be brought in a jug rather than constantly having to look for refills bewilders me. This is a total no brainer! Drinks service v slow. My main course was nearly finished when the wine came. Pity, because the food here is superb"

17,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful vibes! Awesome cocktails! Cocktails üçπ I went with a few colleagues and we sat there for a couple hours talking over the next rounds. Service was a bit slow, but their tapas are pretty good especially the fried balls."
18,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 2 stars ,a year ago,"The food was okay. Unfortunately there weren‚Äôt many vegetarian or vegan options on the menu. The staff lacked attention and was not confident when speaking English. They charge you 4,5 ‚Ç¨ for bread, at least if you‚Äôre a tourist I guess."

21,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food wise, this place is EXPENSIVE. The service is typically Dutch, ie, slow and without any charm. The food quality is not bad, but I cannot fathom how they can justify their price tag. ‚Ä¶"
22,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Horrible choice! - I would give you 0 stars if I could.

23,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The atmosphere is nice and the food is ok, the staff is friendly but we had to wait for more than 30 min between starter and main course. The wait totally killed the experience of a good dinner."
24,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Flavor that is outstanding and service that is truly wonderful.
25,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I love the over-the-top interior. Go on a weekday (because less crowded) and sit by the big plate glass window inside for watching the Rembrandtplein action. It's a huge barn of a space with a corporate-y vibe, and the beer list is tiny, ‚Ä¶"
26,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Unbelievable how long one has to wait for ordering a drink. Staff is friendly and speaks Dutch. Tips are earned due to excellent service: come to London and learn how.

34,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 1 star ,2 years ago,On a slow night we still had to wait 20 min before someone took our order.  I was sent away by the bar tender when I was tired of waiting with a statement that someone would come to us.  So we had to wait for another 5min. Terrible service!!
35,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The place looks very nice. The staff was a bit below expectation. The food was nice. I recommend the truffle risotto with parmesan. ‚ú®

37,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 2 stars ,8 years ago,Located at the Rembrandt square it's one of the big restaurants there. I can't say I was impressed by te food. Had a Black Angus steak which wasn't really big. The presentation of the food was nice but it wasn't worth the price.

39,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"A nice fancy restaurant with quality music, service and food! I only wouldn't recommend you to take the Panini, because I was a little bit dissapointed that the Panini I ordere looked like a 'normal' cheese sandwich.

40,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 1 star ,4 years ago,Can't take a simple order. They don't know the difference between a red and a white wine! Trying too hard on the high class image to actually provide high class service...

43,Kitchen & Bar Van Rijn, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The location of this restaurant is great. The staff was very friendly, and the set menu had some good offerings. It was fine dining, but not so fine that the meal comes in unrecognizable forms. Worth a stop."
