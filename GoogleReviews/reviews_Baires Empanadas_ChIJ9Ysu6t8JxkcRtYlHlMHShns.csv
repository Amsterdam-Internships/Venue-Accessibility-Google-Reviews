7,Baires Empanadas, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Empanadas are relatively good and the staff are quiet friendly and helpful. But this is more like a shop than a Restaurant and you may wanna go and just get your food and leave. The negative part was the cushions outside on the benches which were not clean and it seems like it is not taken care of properly.

42,Baires Empanadas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great empanadas! I'm just not sure why sometimes the dough is dry and shrivel and other times it is crunchy and tasteful. I think it depends what time in the day you go to get the most fresh ones
43,Baires Empanadas, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Love this place! They can speak multiple languages, they are friendly and the food is simply great! Some space to sit outside too!"
44,Baires Empanadas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wide selection of fillings, which taste nice. The dough was a little stiff and not as flakey as the South American empanadas I’m used to although I think any palate should give these hand snacks a bite! Neat little spot."

48,Baires Empanadas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is very good for the food, but very small. In summer with the outside seats is perfect. Ideal as a take out since the empanadas are very tasty. Also, it can serve as your local supply of dulce de leche.
It's missing a more comprehensive menu, maybe deserts and some entry..."

51,Baires Empanadas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Empanadas are really tasty. Although expensive. But they are expensive in Europe as a whole so no surprise. You can also buy Havana's Dulce de Leche here with a cheaper price than amazon or any other store (online and physical) I've seen in Europe so far
52,Baires Empanadas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely tasty empanadas. You have plenty to choice from. Perfect for lunch or a quick snack to bring with you or sit there. Nice outdoor seating. Not a big place so not many tables unfortunatly. No serving of alchohol either but that is fine. I would say a must go of you're in Amsterdam.
53,Baires Empanadas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great emapanadas quality. As an Argentinian must say I felt at home. The location is also nice, you can seat in a table outside in front of a small square and a canal or eat inside of a “gezellig” cozy small room."

59,Baires Empanadas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice homemade and fresh empanadas. Many flavour to choose, and starting from 3.5 each (if you buy more, you get discounts).
