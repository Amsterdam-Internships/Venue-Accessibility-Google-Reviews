0,The Cottage, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"This is the greatest Sunday roast available in the Netherlands. The lamb roast was absolutely spectacular and provided truly authentic British energy. Make sure to get the desert. This restaurant has a 3 layer ginger cake made by the gods, and a scone cake with custard that can make a grown man cry."

4,The Cottage, 3 stars ,7 months ago,I‚Äôve had the Sunday roast and chicken pie. The roast was a few thin cuts of beef with potatoes and vegetables comprising the majority of the dish (overpriced). The chicken pie was ok. This restaurant is a bit overpriced - nothing special at all. Servers were rather nice and the atmosphere was chill.
