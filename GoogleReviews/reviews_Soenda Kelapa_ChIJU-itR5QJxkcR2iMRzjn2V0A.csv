0,Soenda Kelapa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We ordered the 2 persons meal menu and get to taste a wide variety of selections. ‚Ä¶
1,Soenda Kelapa, 1 star ,4 months ago,"For a dutch-indonesian person as I  it was an utterly disappointing experience...were served food we had not ordered. Quality and flavours mediocre at best.
Waiter hectic ( just 12 guests in restaurant).  Can definitely not recommend."
2,Soenda Kelapa, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Unfortunately this wasn‚Äôt a great experience. I‚Äôm half-Indonesian, and to me, the food tasted like they had warmed up the leftovers from yesterday. That doesn‚Äôt have to mean that it can‚Äôt taste good. But our dishes just didn‚Äôt taste fresh. ‚Ä¶"
3,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent rice tables (composed of many small dishes), friendly service. Vegetarian rice tables available, also for 1 person. Vegetarian sateh available, made with tempeh"
4,Soenda Kelapa, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Had the rice plate, wasn't disappointed. Rich spicy tastes, good execution. Our reservation was late though."
5,Soenda Kelapa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Staffs are friendly. The chicken soup with coconut milk was amazing. Set for 2 person offered various flavors for greedy foodies at one time.
6,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent, quiet Indonesian restaurant. Lovely staff, very helpful and charming. Traditional Rijsttafel, so many wonderful and delicious dishes!"
7,Soenda Kelapa, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Great rijsttafel! The food was good, the waiter was attentious and the price is good"
8,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,a year ago,We had the two people rice table and changed the white rice to fried rice and fried noodles. Everything was very tasty and the owner was very friendly. Highly recommend!
9,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Wow! Everything is amazing. The food is top notch, the service is great, the environment is nice and comfortable. Top marks!"
10,Soenda Kelapa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Just had Reistafeln for one person. In short it was a lot of food but taste was just okay. Service was extremely nice, that is 3 stars for the food and 1 extra for good service. I had better indonesien food just a few meters away."
11,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very attentive and nice staff. We had the shared menu. A fiest for the eyes! Tasty as well. ‚Ä¶
12,Soenda Kelapa, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Great food but they accept a limited number of credit cards.
13,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food was amazing!  Each dish was so flavourful. Their coconut chicken soup was the star of the show
14,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to get a rice table. Has one and two person options. Not too busy when I went at 6pm.
15,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was so amazing! I am a chef, traveling with a bunch of good people, and we stopped here for dinner. Everything was so good. The food was vibrant and flavorful. It truly was a joy to eat. The staff was just so accommodating to me ‚Ä¶"
16,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was absolutely delicious - ours was all served in small dishes and great for sharing. It's worth asking for advice on what to choose, as some of the food can be very spicy - still tasted great though. You can also choose varieties of ‚Ä¶"
17,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Small Indonesian restaurant. Very good tasty food. Good value for money.
18,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Apparently own by an Indonesian Family and the owner is very friendly. I, myself is an Indonesian and have so long logging for authentic indonesian dishes. It was fresh, good and just what I expected. I will definitely come over again when I'm back in Amsterdam.
Very recommended!"
19,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We were walking about looking for somewhere to eat on our last evening in Amsterdam. We peeked at the menu and it looked like a good variety of options plus some all in Rijsttafels which we were informed (by Google) were traditional. We ‚Ä¶
20,Soenda Kelapa, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food was okay and service was very slow. Will be trying another Indonesian restaurant next time.
21,Soenda Kelapa, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Flavors of food was decent, but nothing to write home about. Authenticity is really compromised here as the food is so extremely mild and apparently there is no way to ask for it to be made spicy the way it should be. I asked for hot sauce ‚Ä¶"
22,Soenda Kelapa, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food was really good although not very spicy (a Dutch relative told us to expect that as the locals don‚Äôt like it too hot). Limited wine choices but the Trappist beer is great. Cash only too. Can get really busy so book ahead.
23,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food, small cozy place and very friendly staff.
Portions are ginormous, so you can hardly finish a meal for one and some starters with 2 (hungry) people :)) ‚Ä¶"
24,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food! Try the riceplates if you're with a big group. We were about 18 and they accommodated us on the 2nd floor and brought the food out at the same time. Everyone was delighted and happy. Well definitely come back!
25,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My family and I had our first dinner in Amsterdam at this restaurant. To our surprise, the food was just like from hometown.üòô Very authentic n delicious.   The service was  very friendly. Really really recommend this place."
26,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Holy moly this was yummy food!! For never having Indonesian food in this format before they were very helpful and let us swap out a couple dishes. It was so delicious and was way under priced for how delicious it was.
27,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,with my colleagues I enjoyed a great dinner with excellent food and a pleasant service. It is a rather small restaurant and they only accept cash. But I warmly recoomend them
28,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food here was absolutely amazing and the servers were so helpful and welcoming. Would definitely recommend this to friends and hope to visit again one day.
29,Soenda Kelapa, 1 star ,3 years ago,We come here because of high ratings. It‚Äôs very disappointing. Taste is not good. Most of dishes were cooked before ordered. It‚Äôs more like a mini buffet
30,Soenda Kelapa, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Take the most complete rijssttafel, it's delicious! I think it's a family owned restaurant. The lady working there gave me a little history lesson on the origin of the soto soup - thanks!"
31,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Superb family run home cooked Indonesian food, specialising in rifstaffels but with a la carte as well. They take pride in what they do and are keen to offer helpful options."
32,Soenda Kelapa, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly staff and nice food. We had different versions of the rijsttafel - very tasty. The Gado Gado is a bit bland though.
33,Soenda Kelapa, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Bland food, very unassuming setting, minimalist wine choice (the menu literally states ""wine bottle"" as the one and only choice). Really no reason to recommend this place."
34,Soenda Kelapa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Authentic Indonesian restaurant. Informal, small but very cosy. Good food and very friendly helpful staff. Also for take-a-way!"
