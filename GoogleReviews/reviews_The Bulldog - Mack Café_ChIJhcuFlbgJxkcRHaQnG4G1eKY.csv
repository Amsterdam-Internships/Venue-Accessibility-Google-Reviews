0,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,a week ago,Stopped here for breakfast. I had the English breakfast and my wife had a cheese and tomato omelette on toast.

6,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 1 star ,a week ago,This place wouldn't give me a itemized bill. Even one of the waitresses said my bill was wrong. But the head Bartender would fix it. If you American beware of this place.

The terrace in Amsterdam.
Great food and freedom."
8,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,Worst brand of coffee shop only some tourists don't know that... AVOID !!
9,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 1 star ,4 months ago,We were overcharged and the waitress refused to show us the receipt. One star is too much.
10,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Various options for big or small breakfast but the service is really slow and it takes a lot of your time even if there aren't many customers around.
11,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I love this place, one of my favourite places in Amsterdam. The music is pumping, everyone seems chilled. There seems to be more seating in here than compared to the majority of coffeeshops. The Coffee is great, the bud is great, the staff are great. And they have free wifi ;)"

16,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Bulldog is the place to go. If you are in Amsterdam you have to visit this place. No matter what.

22,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,8 months ago,A few meters away from the 'Bulldog the first'. Also a nice place to hangout and enjoy a drink and a smoke. Cool vibes!
23,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 2 stars ,6 months ago,A bit over priced and terrible customer service. (the bar) they were very rude.
24,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Very busy and touristy a little much for me!
25,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,a month ago,Ate a perfectly cooked hamburger
26,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very rude lady wanted to charge me and then wouldn't take my coins to use the bathroom, apparently 2 euro cents aren't valid here! We also asked for small Heineken and they charged us for 5 euro bottles rather than the 2 euro 80 cent size. Very bad tourist rip off establishment. Avoid, you'll have a much better time elsewhere!"
27,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great place to stay in the heart of Amsterdam. well priced and safe, they only let people with cards in so you know you'll be safe. Everything is within walking distance, you can smoke in the dining room and there's a terrace on the top ‚Ä¶"
28,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 1 star ,a year ago,"Very bad experience. Very rude bartender. He directly smashed a couple of glasses before our eyes just becouse he had a bad mood. When i asked for a bill when he asked money, he looks like he want to kill me directly. Never again."
29,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 1 star ,3 years ago,Disappointed. Much better places with much friendlier staff. Here they were rude and aggressive. Many people were smoking cigarettes inside yet I happened to light one at the bar and the lady snatched it away and shouted very aggressively. ‚Ä¶
30,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Smoke, eat, drink, play some music and enjoy! The girls from staff are awesome!"
31,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 1 star ,3 years ago,I went in to simply buy 2 joints. When I got to the counter the lady started of by completely ignoring me for about a minute while I just stood in front of her. I asked for what I wanted and she told me they were out of what I was looking ‚Ä¶
32,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Second time I have been here and no complaints staff always friendly a nice chilled place to be in Amsterdam..

34,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice people, nice place, everything nice üòÅ"
35,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The worst experience i ever had, the staff is not helpfull at all, iam not experiemced smoker and the guy their ended up giving us the worst kind off weed  (looked like dried mint leaves) i learned how it looks later on. And the worst part ‚Ä¶"
36,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Used to be a good place. Now it's so full with people its impossible to move. And will take you 25 minutes minimum just to get served. Much better cafes around.
37,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Jeeeezzzz, the beer here is horrendous. A large party all had beer on taps and it was completely flat and lifeless. We didn‚Äôt finish the over priced drinks and got the heck out of there. Wouldn‚Äôt not go back."
38,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I was there 2 times. Super place. You will have all in one place. But now i put 3 becouse the staff on 7.11 and 8.11 said me that no more such institution in Red District. And now here only coffeshop and hemp store... why? Where is show, food, drinks, and disco? Is not it profitable???"
39,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great place to eat breakfast in morning or beer in evening with a joint
40,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It had a nice quaint atmosphere. They have space cakes that contain 300mg thc. Cost was 7 euro. They are right on the canal.  The bouncer turned away some young blondes in front of me.  I told him I was from Seattle and he rushed me inside with a wink and a nod.  Will go back.
41,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Do you want to chill next to one of Amsterdam‚Äôs canals to relax?
Bulldog is really a nice place to have a drink, smoke a cigarette or joint, or to have a spacecake. You can buy this inside, it costs ‚Ç¨7. Music there can be raucous sometimes"
42,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 1 star ,3 years ago,"ZERO FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!

Went to get some hash. The bald gentleman serving at the counter had no idea of ‚Ä¶"
43,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Visited Amsterdam on many occasions and on every trip I like to go to the Bulldog Mack to soak up the atmosphere. It can get busy and it can be hard to find seating but with a little patience you should be able to park your bottom. Weed friendly
44,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 3 stars ,3 years ago,As with most franchises - you pay for convenience. These Bulldog franchises are on every corner but their products are NOT the best priced. You can definitely find better quality goods at much more competitive prices in other ‚Ä¶
45,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very busy but very reliable for all things green and even a cold beer at some of them.  Seems like the Walmart of coffeeshops and I like to visit the small independent ones but if you want to be around people and in the heart of the rld this is the place.
46,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,6 months ago,This burger?? Make my day.love it
47,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Ok place a pub at the front and as you walk to the back it turns in to a cespit drug den
48,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Top place, many choices but little expensive"
49,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place with green atmosphere BUT toilets/bathroom should be free for customers. I'm a tourist with a curren$y card only, no ca$h in a pocket!!"
50,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome place where you can smoke weed and drink alcohol! Sound pretty normal in Amsterdam but there's only few places where you can even smoke a cigarette with your glass of beer, let alone a nice fat joint!! ‚Ä¶"
51,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 2 stars ,5 years ago,The staff were not very talkative and did not appear to be welcoming. I visited with my friends on my first trip to Amsterdam. The place felt like a biker bar and I always felt like I needed to watch my pockets and bag.
52,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Very nice, really good workers"
53,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"For me it was a good experience, had a good beer, good vibes , lady serving was nice and useful, explained how things go arround (my first time in Amsterdam)"

55,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great atmosphere üëåüèΩ perfect place to chill and smoke your own weed whilst listening to a mixture of tunes to suit all.. sells alcohol but the cuppucino was üòã.. would deffo recommend
56,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Really good burger, i recommand"

59,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A great caf√© for consuming a bevarage and a joint at the same time. Popular by tourists. Price of a beer: ‚Ç¨2.50 The bar doesn't sell weed/hasj. For that you'd have to go 50m down the street to one of the other Bulldog establishments.
60,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Old school coffee shop with good music and nice atmosphere.
61,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Overpriced and crowded but they have very good weed. For the location it's only normal that they charge a bit more. It's still worth the visit
62,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good ambience and friendly staff. Nice place to chill. Shakes were average and the place was a little cramped inside.
63,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best spots in Amsterdam to experience 420, no matter whether you smoke or not. Right in the happening area"
64,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 1 star ,5 years ago,Hash was un smokeable and the weed was either fake or the synthetic type. I literally had to throw it out.. I could have smoke a suitcase full and still been sober as a joke.

69,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The working crew is very nice and the place is big with a lot of Art on the walls. Good place to chill out with friends after the long day.
70,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Definitely a great time. The only downside was how busy all of the locations are! It‚Äôs hard to find a seat, sometimes even a place to stand."
71,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Horrible customer service. We felt very unwelcomed. One of the guys from the staff was really rude to us when we were only trying to buy , I will not recommend it to anyone."
72,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very well located coffeeshop in Amsterdams RLD. Manged to get a group of chairs by the bar in no time whatsoever. 5 euros for a bottle of Bulmers cider and the vibe was great!

76,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Commercial but you can smoke, drink and eat in one place. Decent menu also. Good vibes."
77,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Everything has it's own charm including the tables and chairs. Very distinctive. Good weed too.

88,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Small and crowded. Great customer service. Weed is ok but doesn't stand out from the crowd.
89,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice little coffee place/bar in which you can't smoke but you can have a herbal cigarette!
90,The Bulldog - Mack Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the bulldog coffeeshops that I like the most because of their seat in the back of the bar and the music ‚úå
