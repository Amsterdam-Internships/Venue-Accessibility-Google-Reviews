4,Cafe Vrijdag, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy cafe at a great location. 5 min walk from Amstel station. Outside seating, friendly staff and food is OK. Also space for larger groups or afternoon drinks with friends. Can get a bit loud. So wouldn't recommend for working unless you get in early. I had the granola and croissant breakkie."
5,Cafe Vrijdag, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had a work dinner here. I started off with this sesame seed crusted salmon with a wasabi sauce followed by the steak (cooked medium) and ended the chocolate brownie. The salmon was absolutely exquisite - great taste. I would have liked the …

10,Cafe Vrijdag, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing pub, just a 10minute walk from the Amstel station. Food is great, though a little on the expensive side. Staff is super nice. Ambience and the crowd is awesome. A lot of corporate crowd due to closeness to corporate offices. Ask for the chef's special. Confit de canard is absolutely amazing!"

20,Cafe Vrijdag, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great and cozy place to have a coffee, a beer or tea. Also, the food is very tasty.  I recommend the Limburg meatballs. They were perfect with a glass of cold beer. Next time though I'll take the burger."
21,Cafe Vrijdag, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good vibes and good food. Even though this cafe is in an area with mediocre dining and drink options, cafe vrijdag is a fun place to hang out with good food. The service can be a bit slow, but that’s a common theme in Amsterdam"
22,Cafe Vrijdag, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly staff, great design and yummy dishes. The breakfasts menu has not many but all delishes options and they make a very good Cafe Latte. Location close to the Amstel makes it a nice destination after your walk along the river"
23,Cafe Vrijdag, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"The drinks can be a little pricey but service is good and fairly quick and the staff are helpful and friendly which is good.  There is a fairly positive and fun going crowd there most nights, good place to go for an after work drink. …"

28,Cafe Vrijdag, 1 star ,2 years ago,Great design. Good food. Lousiest service on a weekend evening. Pathetic service with an attitude— they forgot our order and took 20 to find a beer at the bar. Tragic.

30,Cafe Vrijdag, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Arrived, Waited for 10 min and no one taking my order, then I went inside and ordered by myself. Ask for water, water never arrived. Asked a salad with avocado, and of course no avocado ( that never arrived even when asked again). And btw …"
31,Cafe Vrijdag, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Awesome staff with a great selection of beers on tap. Can get very busy during prime time and the menu is locked base on your visiting hour. Great with kids!
32,Cafe Vrijdag, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Grand cafe type bar with good food. Nice view on the Berlage bridge and also a lot of space for groups in the back. Very friendly and alert employees. A good selection of special beers and an interesting menu.
33,Cafe Vrijdag, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The waitress was cranky as hell, had to walk up to her twice to first ask for the menu and 10 mins later if she would please set our table. When asked if she could oh so please could help us she responded in the most cranky way ever. Walked away after that, ridiculous place. Thanks for ruining our valentine's day!!"
34,Cafe Vrijdag, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Overall, a good place to go to have beer and get something to eat. The Vrijdag burger is tasty and the service helpful and efficient. As it happens with most Amsterdam bars or restaurants, it can become very crowded and nosy. Located next to the beautiful Amstel river."
35,Cafe Vrijdag, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We've eaten in a lot of different places across Amsterdam this weekend from pancake houses to French fine dining, but the lunch we had here was our favourite meal - really well thought out flavours, very delicious and well priced"

53,Cafe Vrijdag, 1 star ,4 years ago,"These guys know nothing about service. Noone comes to you, once you go and order yourself, you will have to wait quite a bit. Not even mentioning that they are super unfriendly."
