0,Gambrinus, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Terrific neighborhood cafe, the kind we love to stumble across. Excellent food. Their tripel - brewed just for them - was one of the best I've had. The daily special - an Indian beef dish with green beans, rice and a marinated egg - was delicious. My wife's satay was also excellent."
1,Gambrinus, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Had the chicken skewers and bitterballen. They were good, but I enjoyed the other restaurants. The restaurant isn't very handicap friendly. Most of the dining area is up or down stairs and getting to the restroom is impossible if you're handicapped."
2,Gambrinus, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place- very relaxed; feels like a bar, yet serves top quality food with great service. I was able to do some work on my laptop while enjoying a glass of wine and having a perfectly cooked pork tenderloin. One thing that was annoying were the fruit flies flying around, but I guess it's the season for them.."
