4,Pizza Amsterdam, 2 stars ,a year ago,I had the Vegan Aphrodite. The crust is tasty. The eggplant was not totally done and the hummus was missing. The cheese was a lot. I won't order here again. Would recommend Pizza Heart or Nnea.

10,Pizza Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great tasting pizza, both gluten-free and regular. They evidently usually have vegan cheese, but were out when we went. There was some confusion on the phone. This place is mainly for delivery and take-out; there is only very limited seating inside. The pizza almost completely made up for the confusion, though."
11,Pizza Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Ordered delivery and they arrived early. Their gluten free pizza is good (not the best I‚Äôve ever had but definitely tasty - and the nicest I‚Äôve had in Amsterdam so far). I would recommend and will order from them again.
12,Pizza Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Half of my order is always gluten-free and everything is very good. Big reason for sticking with them is that they are always friendly and fair. If they ever get anything wrong, they note it and fix it straight away or will remember it for your next order. Never any hassle..."
