0,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"I LOVE Mas. When I was in college, it was a ""treat yo self"" type of place. Since graduating, it's definitely become one of my must-go-to restaurants while in Charlottesville. I have shared Mas with so many of my loved ones and they all love ‚Ä¶"
1,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Every tapas dish was absolutely delicious and perfectly plated. The grilled octopus had a nice char, and the sauce and charred lemon was a great combo with the octopus. Texture was just the right amount of chew. Would highly recommend the ‚Ä¶"
2,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Had a great dinner at Mas Tapas last night. All the dishes we tasted were delicious! I especially liked the lamb and beef burger. The service was friendly and efficient and the portions are generous. This was our first time, but we definitely plan to return."
3,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a month ago,"We had the mushroom risotto, the clams, some egg/dough thing in really thin layers. I forget what the names were on the menu...but the food was AMAZING. We also had amazing seasonal cocktails, Mas has the rare quality of elevating cocktails to be special and interesting as opposed to ""just"" using fancy ingredients."
4,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"My first in restaurant experience since the start of the pandemic. (I'm sure that seems crazy,  but it is what it is.) I had a great time at Mas. All staff was masked (thank you!). We went early and had plenty of space between us and other ‚Ä¶"
5,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,I love Mas! I‚Äôve only been a few times but it has always been amazing. My husband and I went last night for our anniversary and we had the best time. The staff were all super friendly and taking all COVID precautions. The food and cocktails ‚Ä¶
6,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,2 months ago,"I took my wife here for our anniversary dinner. After looking at the menu, photos, and reviews online, I thought this restaurant would be a great place to have a date. Unfortunately, our server wasn‚Äôt very attentive and seemed very aloof. ‚Ä¶"
7,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Service was good, food was good, can't complain. Be sure you like food with a bit of spice in it though; my sister is quite opposed to spicy food and I ended up eating quite a lot of our meal myself."
8,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Every time I go to Mas, I leave extremely satisfied. Last visit we treated ourselves to the Iberico ham, which is absolutely delicious. We also enjoyed their boccadillos (Serrano ham, manchego cheese & garlic aioli on bread) which were so ‚Ä¶"
9,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"My wife and I just enjoyed a 3rd year anniversary dinner at Mas, and it continues to be one of our favorite restaurants around!  Our service was excellent, and the flavors are just unbeatable."
10,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Had the most awesome feast here, such a great time with exquisite tapas (even if inspired by the cuisine of Costa Fortuna)."
11,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Favorite restaurant in Charlottesville! Food is fairly priced and always delicious. I have brought friends here and each one of them has loved it. Only downside is you always need a reservation to eat here because it is so popular.
12,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,11 months ago,Food was outstanding - recommended wine was fantastic. Old fashion wasn‚Äôt very good - server was pretty good.
13,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A hipstery tapas bar in a bad neighbor. You kinda have to fight for your seat if you want a chance at the bar. ‚Ä¶
14,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and atmosphere. Really enjoyed it here.  Thought everything was reasonably priced as well. Went after a day of hiking and got 5 dishes to split with a friend.  We left full.  Portions weren't huge, it's tapas, but were ‚Ä¶"
15,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Often, you get the gist of a place after one visit - this is not one of those places. They have a sizable menu and you really can't go wrong with anything, I really look forward to visiting again more than once and finishing out their ‚Ä¶"
16,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,4 months ago,TERRIBLE food and worse service. The sorriest restaurant experience in years. I scoured reviews looking for an interesting restaurant to take my husband for his birthday and picked this so called Spanish restaurant because they served ‚Ä¶
17,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,a year ago,Server was attentive and friendly. Cocktails were strong and food was so good! We will definitely be back next time we are in town!

19,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,5 months ago,The food at Mas is good‚Ä¶ but I was treated like a liar. I‚Äôm a international student. I talked to a couple staff. I told them I have a bachelors degree & I‚Äôm a graduate student @ UVA. One of them rolled their eyes at me and disrespected me. ‚Ä¶
20,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a month ago,"BRIAN, MY WAITER IS A GENIUS OF A PAINTER WHO DID OVER A DOZEN OIL PAINTINGS THAT BRILLIANTLY BRING TO LIFE THE SPIRIT OF MAS AND EVEN TAPAS CULTURE IN A FORCE MAJEUR OF BEAUTIFUL AESTHETIC EXUBERANCE. I WAS IN BAD SHAPE GOING IN AND NOW ‚Ä¶"
21,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing, high quality food. The host wasn‚Äôt the most welcoming, but overall a good experience. It‚Äôs expensive but worth it if you‚Äôre a foodie."
22,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Always a great place to go. If you dont have an appetite just read the menu and your mouth will water with anticipation and your stomach will growl with desire...
23,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My favorite restaurant in Charlottesville. Food is good. Drinks are good. Staff is good. Hours are good. Everything is good. Go here or you're not good.
24,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Great service, and aesthetic, but outrageous price for the portions you get. A plate that is family size only feeds 2 people."
25,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This was one of the best meals I have had in a while. The cauliflower dish is simply amazing. Four of us split 9 tapas and left satisfied.
26,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Shared a spinach salad, bacon wrapped dates, cheese plate, and brussels sprouts, and a glass of wine (don't remember which) with my mom.  Everything was amazing - the service is great, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is welcoming!  I've been back numerous times :-)"
27,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Took 2 friends from out of town to this joint and we all pretty much agreed. The food is decent and the paella wasn't anywhere near the price tag. The sangria is also subpar and doesn't taste any different from a much cheaper restaurant. It ‚Ä¶
28,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Mas is a wonderful culinary/social experience. Tapas are fabulous, atmosphere incredible and staff and service the best!!!! Sydney the host is adorable !!!! As is the rest of the staff!!! A must if you are eating out in c-ville!"
29,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I'm kind of judgmental cuz I live across the street from this place I see how busy it is.. until I ate the food.. and it's awesome.. buenos goes far and above to make sure you satisfied!! Definitely a great manager..
30,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,a year ago,The food is enjoyable but seems uninspired for ‚Äúbest restaurant in Charlottesville‚Äù or for how far in advance you have to make a reservation. None of the food jumped out as incredible or overly creative. We went almost entirely off of the ‚Ä¶
31,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Great food. Ended up ordering way more than we needed based on our servers recommendation. Likely do not need the larger portions even with 4 people. Recommend sticking withe the tapas portions.
32,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,a year ago,"Had the Paella dinner for two and was very disappointed. The chicken, shrimp, and sausage were well over cooked and most of the muscles didn‚Äôt have the meat inside. Not to mention the sausage tasted like a Slim Jim. The dressing they use ‚Ä¶"
33,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Wow, I already want to go back. The tapas was amazing and the service and safety protocols were top notch. They had a good wine list with a ton of
Spanish wines and great cocktails too. Definitely make a reservation now!"
34,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,All the people leaving sassy comments should just get over themselves. I usually stay away from tapas for fear of leaving hungry.. not here. This was damn good. You must try if in town.
35,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My husband and I had a dinner here , to celebrate Mother's Day the food was excellent and the service really good. nice atmosphere and delicious drinks!"
36,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,a year ago,After many great experiences last night fell way short.  This was my first time back since Covid started and Mas re-opened and the experience was truly disappointing üòû.  I don‚Äôt want to knit pick but it was the food that fell way short not ‚Ä¶
37,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Monticello Appellation Wine Tours often drops guests off here at the end of a tour for dinner! Located in the cute Belmont District, this is one of our absolute favorite restaurants!"
38,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,a year ago,"The worst ‚Äúdining‚Äù experience I‚Äôve ever had. Showed up 10 minutes early, only to find out that our reservation had been cancelled, but neither one of us ever cancelled it! Instead of finding a way to accommodate us, they told us there was ‚Ä¶"
39,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Unexpected treasure. You would be excused if you mistook the space for being unoccupied - except for the cars in the small parking lot, there's no indication that your taste buds are about to be delighted. The interior decor is pretty raw, ‚Ä¶"
40,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,So the deal is tapas right? So small orders to share needs to be shareable not something that needs to be cut into suitable portions. The other issue was zero table space for your tapas. The quality of food was good not perfect or amazing. ‚Ä¶
41,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Took my parents here and it was great. Plates are very small but frequently very delicious. Bacon wrapped dates and seared tuna are both amazing. Can be pricey if you order a lot of different things but the flavors are intense. Well worth it!
42,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I have been to Mas regularly over the past 15 years and have always had dishes that make me want to come back. It is a popular restaurant in the downtown Belmont area and does get crowded quickly especially on the weekend. ‚Ä¶
43,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is my first tapas experience and it definitely made me want to go to more places like this. All of the food we had was extremely delicious and well timed so that we always had food in front of us after finishing a dish. Many options for different price points and dietary restrictions.
44,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went here first time on a Sat night at 8:00 pm, was seated immediately! Place was packed. Staff is super friendly and helpful. The food is out of this world fantastic!! Had a variety of 6 different dishes between 2 people. Hands down best ‚Ä¶"
45,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for small plates and good service. Inside or outside dining. Spanish type Tapas and small plates. Quality food
46,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,lots of options to try many different things :)) - not very authentically Mexican but definitely good regardless
47,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"You won‚Äôt be disappointed by any dish. So delicious and an absolute must. Super friendly staff, as well! :)"
48,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great food, great service, like all tapas places it can stack prices up quick. Drinks are excellent!"
49,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been here many times over the years and while there occasionally is a dish that we get I don‚Äôt particularly care for, some of the best meals I have ever had have been here.  I love coming here with friends and visitors alike.  I recommend the papas braves and obviously the bacon wrapped dates.  You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
50,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,No problem getting a table outside.  Waitress was helpful in explaining how everything worked and had some very good suggestions.  We had 4-5 tapas.  They were all delicious.  My favorite was the Cauliflower and the Grilled Octopus.  The least favorite was the Carne Asada.
51,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"The food is amazing.  Be adventuresome and order a bunch of tapas to share - you won't be let down, all of them are so intense and truly delicious.  I love a restaurant that will present a dish that I have never had and give me a new experience to try - the adventuresome chef is a true artisan!"
52,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I‚Äôve personally been to Spain and this is my new favorite tapas restaurant in the whole world! With variations in price, quality of their food does not falter. The staff are accommodating and the kitchen staff can make any item of food into ‚Ä¶"
53,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"As a Mediterranean person, I am always underwhelmed by Mas. This is not good tapas. It is oily in an unnatural way. It is not okay to buy supermarket chorizo and put it on a plate and charge up the nose. It is not okay to bring 2 cups of ‚Ä¶"
54,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Honestly was not a fan, would not go back unless someone was paying for my meal. I went with a group of six and we ordered a number of dishes. Most of them were okay/fine, only one (the tortaletta) was really good. The service was not ‚Ä¶"
55,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Food was great. Perfect for a date night or small group of friends. You may have to wait for a table. Ordering was a little intimidating since there are so many options. We shared 8 tapas plates between 4 people and were very happy - definitely a light dinner though.
56,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Easily our favorite restaurant in Charlottesville.  You may have to wait for a while, as there is limited seating, but the food is well worth it!  They always have a great variety on the menu.  Take it easy, enjoy your time there.  No need ‚Ä¶"
57,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I went here for a first date and it was crowded.  We had a short wait before getting to our table.  The menu contains a lot of Spanish, so I let my date (who was Hispanic) pick out our tapas.  Everything was delicious, except for a hummus ‚Ä¶"
58,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I don't usually rate restaurants but I feel it would be a disservice to everyone if I didn't post a warning.  Waited an hour and thirty minutes for a table. Two other couples who came after us were given tables before us and when asked, ‚Ä¶"
59,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"and when you need to eat a lot you go to Mas, many small plats to pick from and everything just taste so awesome. Please if you are on diet don't even look at this place, else its all yours. ‚Ä¶"
60,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food. Like really good food. But only go if you want to be treated like an enormous burden while paying upwards of 40$ a person. They have a really small staff, which normally justifies waiting an hour to be seated.  Makes total sense. ‚Ä¶"
61,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wonderful atmosphere and incredible food in a cool hole-in-the-wall location in Belmont. Lots of vegan/vegetarian options. Our server was knowledgable and staggered our tapas perfectly for a nice evening of fun food pairings and cocktails.
62,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I've eaten at Mas on three different occassion in the last 18 months. Each time I've been disappointed. The food is good, but not as great as I'd expected based on it's strong reviews. It gets quite loud in the downstairs room and feels ‚Ä¶"
63,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Best tapas in Charlottesville.  They also have the best cocktails.  Kind of expensive, but worth it. I find the best experience is in a group of 4 or more, which allows you to try more different kinds of dishes.  Be prepared to wait though, they are very popular."
64,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Mas tapas is great. The food is fantastic and the menu is always changing. Thankfully, they always have the papas bravas on the menu - I think these are our favorites. They also have a drink menu with lots of choices. Their gin and tonics ‚Ä¶"
65,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,6 years ago,What a great place. I have returned over and over and it still amazes me and impresses everyone I have ever taken there. The food the people the wines the mood of the place- has never disappointed any of us. ‚Ä¶
66,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"4 stars if U get there and it's not crowded, otherwise I would give it a lower rating for poor service, long wait time, and crowd. ‚Ä¶"
67,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,2 months ago,Used to be amazing now it's whatever. But at least it's still there
68,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great variety of tapas, good drinks. Wait staff was very attentive. We always stop in when we come into town. One of my favorite tapas places in Charlottesville."
69,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was great. The restaurant is very small and very loud. On a Friday night we waited for over an hour for a table for a party of 6 and they don't take reservations. Definitely go for the food, but plan for long evening."
70,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Currently waiting to be seated. There are no reservations, so it‚Äôs a first-come-first-serve battle. As we‚Äôve waited at the bar for a table we‚Äôve seen multiple other groups come in after us and be given a table before. When asking the ‚Ä¶"
71,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Truly enjoyed our meal.  The tapas were excellent.  There is a good variety of menu choices, which made sharing easy.  The service was very good.  We will eat here again."
72,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Just like being in Spain but without the Mediterranean. Everything is top notch! Save room for chocolate mousse. I'm addicted to their potatoes bravas. Our waitress was super! Get here early, especially on weekends. The line behind up to half an hour before opening."
73,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"I've been to MAS around 10 times and the food is great.  For some reason, the service has always been questionable.  I find, when making a request, many of the servers there act like they are doing me a favor rather than being a server and ‚Ä¶"
74,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"I have to agree with many of the mixed reviews. The owner's aesthetics are great.  I've been there at times when the food was very good and other times when it was actually quite horrible...some of the dishes seemed hurried, not quite ‚Ä¶"
75,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I hate to write reviews. That being said, we had such an unpleasant experience I felt it was needed. Four of my friends and myself visited about a month ago. We got there early and stood in the rain as we knew MAS does not take ‚Ä¶"
76,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As a Spaniard living in the US, I normally avoid tapas places like the plague. They all try to make you feel like you're eating Spanish food, yet all I end up tasting is a weak approximation of what Spanish cuisine actually is. When my ‚Ä¶"
77,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A wonderful, quintessential Charlottesville dining experience. Always amazing."
78,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Very good food.  You can get a drink at the bar and watch the dishes being prepared.  Sangria was very tasty and not too sweet.  Bacon-wrapped dates were delicious.
79,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We frequent Mas on many occasions and always enjoy the food , but almost every time leave feeling like why did we visit there again. The wait staff is by far the rudest and most entitled we have ever encountered. Never again!!! The options ‚Ä¶"
80,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I‚Äôd give this restaurant many more stars if I could.  Food, wine, service, and ambiance are all excellent.  I can confirm that the Spanish tapas dishes are as delicious as ones in Spain! I will be back!"
81,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It's so good I wouldn't share it with you.
82,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,3 years ago,"As many others have said, the food is -good depending upon what you get, however the service is AWFUL. You literally feel like you are a burden from the moment you sit down. Our waitress was blatantly rude to us and made it very clear that ‚Ä¶"
83,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome Spanish cuisine.  A tapas restaurant with delicious selections, served in small portions to eat alone or to share.  Casual, yet classy with patio dining.  A must when in Charlottesville, VA.  One of my favs."
84,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of our favorite places on the earth!  Excellent food, sexy date night ambience, and the drinks are fab: sangria, stellar wine list, on point beer selection, and OMG the fresh cocktails! Most of all, the staff is smart and savvy. Indoor ‚Ä¶"
85,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Food and staff are ALWAYS amazing here. Love coming and meeting family and friends. ‚ô•Ô∏è
86,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food here always blows me away. Super friendly and quick service. The bacon wrapped dates are to die for. If you come on a weekend come early though. People love it and they do not take reservations!
87,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere. My favorite dishes are  the dates wrapped in bacon, the artichokes, and the carne asada (stake), which is delicious.
However, it is too expensive for the quality provided. I also had two instances in which the staff was rude to us."
88,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The mussels were tasty. Carne asada...not so much. We only ate the meat since the sauce and thing it was on tasted bland and cheap. Great prices, though. Nice atmosphere. Was busy so we opted to eat at the bar."
89,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Food,drinks and service were amazing! Can't wait to come back again!"
90,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It's legendary in Charlottesville. Food, drinks, and service are always excellent. It's THE tapas restaurant in town and you'll know it when you show up, because you'll likely have a wait. Get there early or later if you don't want to snipe a place at the bar or get on the seating list."
91,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,The food was delicious and they took extraordinary caution to ensure that we were safe during this pandemic. The service was very attentive as well!
92,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Skip the fixed menu events! I've been to Mas several times and never been disappointed, but their New Year's Eve fixed menu was HORRIBLE! Tiny portions, awful oyster (yes, singular), and a handful of grapes on a plate for dessert. Had to go somewhere else afterward because we were all still hungry."
93,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really nice tapas place with a great patio for outdoor seating.  My fiance and I really enjoyed the Cauliflower, potatoes with a garlic aoli and the paella was delicious."
94,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,6 years ago,"The food is good however I am not sure what the big draw is to this place.  The service is nothing short of totally strange.  Glam shots of food runners??? And the service has a real attitude. When we went our food was so slow so slow, and ‚Ä¶"
95,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,3 years ago,"If you know Spanish food, avoid this place. This is a place to gather with undergrad friends and drink mojitos with BBQ ribs. The most SPanish thing is a soul-less tortilla de patata. A small glass of red wine, $12. A piece of bread, $5. A ‚Ä¶"
96,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, only reason it's not 5 stars was because it was a hot day and the inside was packed and outside was empty, so decided to sit outside because only one table was being used. However the hostess told us weren't aloud to sit at a ‚Ä¶"
97,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Authentic Spanish tapas that absolutely hit the spot. 10/10 recommend. Fantastic wine list perfect for al fresco, great staff."
98,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good Tapas at a reasonable-for-Charlottesville price. The outdoor space was nice in the good weather, I can't say anything was a standout must-have, but everything from the drinks to the food was good quality."
99,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Often a long wait. But always worth it!  Great beer, wine, cocktails and food. A few mainstays on the menu, but by and large it changes daily. A solid ""go-to"" for a great meal in Charlottesville."
100,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlottesville! The tapas menu is pretty extensive, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything is so fresh and delicious. Great wine selection as well!"
101,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It was a great experience, our waitress was absolutely fantastic. The food was good and service was fast. The decor is unique and fun. We will be back next time we are in town."
102,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,10 years ago,"I cannot fathom why this place is rated so highly.  The service was slow, not overly friendly, nor helpful with the menu.  The dishes, although decent portions which is sometimes hard to come by at tapas restaurants, left so much to be ‚Ä¶"
103,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Pricey, but the food is next-level. And tapas means you get to try lots of stuff. I‚Äôd recommend going with 3-4 people and just sharing everything. I‚Äôd expect to spend a minimum of $20/person here and much more with drinks."
104,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,6 years ago,Pricey drinks served with an attitude.  Olives served with drinks at the bar almost make up for it.  Service staff here and across many other Cville restaurants seem to have forgotten that a tip is earned and not an entitlement.  Level of service matters.
105,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Terrific food, great atmosphere, love the non alcoholic cocktails."
106,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best restaurants in Cville, innovative tapas, great cocktails, I've been many times, never dissapointed. A great place to be a little adventurous- trust the chefs and try something new - small plates."
107,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I lived in Spain for 3 years so I worried I'd miss the food a lot upon moving to Charlottesville. Of course the tapas / sangria doesn't compare to what you'd get in Spain, but I think it's the best you're going to find in the US. A little pricey but worth it!"
108,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"I love MAS! It has the most fabulous food, smoked cherry tomatoes, baked goat cheese, dates wrapped in bacon. Been a while since I've been there but I recall it was run (owned?) by the chef, a big, rather large, ugly guy.  I want to marry him and have his children (and eat his food)!!!!"
109,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever found anywhere. The food is always great, and the service is awesome. This is a place I will keep returning to as long as it exists.
I would give it 10 stars if I could."
110,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,This is such a nice tapas restaurant with delicious food and cool ambiance. It's a pity that the staff is not always nice to the customers. That tends to be hit or miss. Sometimes you'll get fantastic servers and sometimes they'll be intensely mean.
111,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"When I travel to Charlottesville Mas Tapas is my go to restaurant.  I have never had a bad experience, until this past weekend, December 13, 2013. I know things happen at a restaurant and have over looked small things.  But this experience, ‚Ä¶"
112,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Haven't eaten there yet. Looking forward to it. Gets great reviews
113,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,6 years ago,The best tapas west of Spain. Maybe even better. Love the food here. Great selection of Spanish wine. Great cocktails. Great staff. Great ambience. My favorite place in Cville.
114,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I grew up in Cville, went to UVA, and moved away. There are two things my hubby and I MUST do every time we come back, or even pass through Virginia: get Bodo's and eat at Mas. Think I'm kidding? We have arranged trips around passing ‚Ä¶"
115,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Some of the best food in Charlottesville. Pricey, and a long wait usually, but worth it. Patio is great when the weather is nice. You can order more as you go if you're not sure what everyone at the table likes."
116,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"As a Spaniard , it's a cool place to go to even though the don't replicate as well our dishes. ( Ditch the tortilla de patatas ) anyways, it's a cool place for a Friday night out but beware of the waiting !"
117,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wine list, menu, service, ambience ‚Äî all are out of the park. Easy to see why this place is now a Charlottesville institution and started the migration into Belmont. And their prices? Feel like 2005."
118,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Every time I visit Cville I try to have a meal at Mas also. Delicious food, great environment, and I especially love the outdoor patio during nice weather. A perfect meal every time."
119,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Delicious.... great service.... nice ambience!
120,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious fresh food. The menu is designed for you to order several little dishes to share, giving you the opportunity to try many different flavors as opposed to one large entree."
121,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great venue!  Food is great!  Staff is friendly and very efficient!  A little pricey but worth it.  One of my favorites in Charlottesville!
122,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,One of my favourite restaurants in Charlottesville (which is saying something!).
123,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of my favorite restaurants in Charlottesville. Great food! The only drawback is that they don't take reservations and it is difficult to park at times.
124,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent food. Loved the Catalan shrimp.
Serrano ham was good quality. Bread - rustic and hearty."
125,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Feel safe there, food and service top notch!"
126,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Atmosphere is intoxicating with the cooking aroma. Food is awesome. Nothing on the menu is bad. Service is top notch.
127,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Food was pricey but delicious. They have a wide selection of alcohol and great dessert. The candle lit atmosphere was romantic and ambient.
128,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome menu and staff! One of favorite places to go on Friday and Saturday night. You have to have the lamb chops!

130,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious! Staff can be a little more accomodating. Some people just want to enjoy the experience and not be rushed with plates.
131,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Always a great evening with great food
132,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,6 years ago,This is the best tapas restaurant in at least Charlottesville and maybe even the world. They have different menu's everyday but all of their food is amazing. A must go if in the Cville area.
133,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Upscale and excellent destination. Possibly the best food in town with a price that shows it. All food here is a la carte. Order roughly 2 items per person and share.
134,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Best Tapas in town. Great wine selection and drinks. If you're in cville it's definitely a place everyone should visit at least once.
135,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"As a Hispanic, food is very mediocre. Service is great tho"

138,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great food and service. It's on the pricier side, but a good splurge if you go into it understanding that."
139,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"The greatest tapas place. Every time my girlfriend and I are in charlottesville we always go here for special occasions. Definitely pricy and popular, but well worth it!"
140,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The customer service is really bad. They sat us at a table next to the entry door where it was freezing and refused to change the seats. The food is good, nothing extraordinary."
141,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food is fantastic! We loved the lamburger and seared tuna. Sangria is also amazing!

161,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Overpriced, service not the greatest, menu item descriptions are slightly deceptive, terrible for groups because of lack of larger tables and the fact that the entire group must order together and checks can't be separated."
162,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very good place.  It is a must try as far as I'm concerned.  Everything I tried there was fantastic.  Next time I go back to C-Ville I'm going back there.
