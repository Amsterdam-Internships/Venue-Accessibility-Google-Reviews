0,Buongiorno Espressobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I think best price quality for high quality coffees. Also home made cakes. You can sit inside and there's a outside terrace as well. My favorite place in west for take away or quick coffee.
1,Buongiorno Espressobar, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Only coffee place open on Christmas day in the neighborhood. Seating was plenty and comfy, atmosphere relaxed and the croissant  fresh. Coffee was slightly burnt by the (too hot) milk. House blend (dark roast) isn't very interesting. Could improve if they offer two different roasts and make sure the barista doesn't overheat the milk."
2,Buongiorno Espressobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"looked a bit touristy which made me sussed, but as recommended, truly good coffee here, folks. an enormous place with indoors and outdoors seating."
3,Buongiorno Espressobar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,For years this has been a lovely spot for a cup of coffee or a little bite. The new interior looks really nice as well!
4,Buongiorno Espressobar, 2 stars ,4 years ago,We came on a Sunday afternoon and pretty much all tables were dirty. Some of them had food and plates from previous customers. …
5,Buongiorno Espressobar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Real Italians making superb strong coffee.
Has working spots, wifi and electricity!
Thanks!"
6,Buongiorno Espressobar, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Nice place but.... If you open at 9.00 on Sunday then you guys should be there BEFORE 9.00 and then open. Appalling I have to wait because at 9.10 nobody is there yet! Not a good way to run a business. When this happens, I go to Stach, just …"
7,Buongiorno Espressobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My colleagues like this place for coffee in the mornings, even though it's a longer walk from work. But having tried the coffee, I like it too! …"

9,Buongiorno Espressobar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I want to love this place because there is so much potential, but it just falls short for me.

10,Buongiorno Espressobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great coffee shop that sells coffees, fresh juices and cakes. There is a lot of space inside so it's perfect for chatting or doing some work. The fresh orange juice was very nice and reasonably priced"
11,Buongiorno Espressobar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very good for coffee and wonderfull carrotcake
12,Buongiorno Espressobar, 2 stars ,a year ago,Ordered 2 sandwiches today at lunchtime with 2 drinks and oreo cheesecake. Drinks were fine. I ordered an old cheese sandwich and said it twice to make sure but got given a goat's cheese sandwich instead. We were told the sandwiches would …

15,Buongiorno Espressobar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"New staff every time I go there. If you go in the afternoon (around 2 pm) and you wanna order a sandwich, they’re too lazy to make it. They talk bad about you in Italian (thinking that you don’t understand it😂). …"

Edit: No more chips paired with the ham and cheese sandwich. That extra crunch …"
17,Buongiorno Espressobar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I used to come here multiple times a week with my dog for coffee. Perhaps due to personnel changes i was informed not to be welcome with my dog. I discovered some other great places in the neighborhood where dogs are welcome, like Local Heros."
18,Buongiorno Espressobar, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"The con was really that I found it too pricey for the food, paid almost 12 EUR for a lunch. Otherwise, nice environment and pretty good sound isolation so I can imagine it is convenient for professionals that need to get some work done. Possibility to sit outside for good weather and inside for bad weather is also a pro."
