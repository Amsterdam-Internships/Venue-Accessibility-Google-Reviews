0,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely little cafe with equally lovely espresso. Really liked it. A good combination with a slice of cake and a good outside view. Could have also sat outside to enjoy the weather if it were not for the terrible weather.
1,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Small but perfect atmosphere. Nice staff. Great coffee!
2,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a nice and cozy place to grab a coffee and stay for a short while. It is a good place to get a quick breakfast before heading out to the shopping area nearby. The coffee was good, but not amazing (but better than many places in Amsterdam). There's also an outside seating area which is nice when the weather is good."
3,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very good coffee, tasty treats and super friendly staff. A place that makes you feel like a regular even when you walk in for the first time!"
4,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious coffee, nice baristas, decent prices, and great latte art- what more could you want??"
5,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The caramel cappuccino is delectable and the baristas are super nice and friendly, very helpful, and made this lone Canadian feel very welcome. As a bonus, they're located right by a couple of really great bookstores and lovely views around the back of the shop of the Singel Canal."
6,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,4 years ago,On of the best places to get coffee in Amsterdam. The staff is always very welcoming and they are very professional and passionate about their coffee! Might be a little bit expensive but I'd rather pay something extra for a nice good coffee!!
7,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Top destination for a good iced latte with oat milk. Tell them to make it strong and you will have a beautiful taste on a hot summer day. No dairy and super good for the mood üòç‚úåüèº
8,Coffee Company, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very very Poor service! I had been to this coffee company recently, Place was very untidy and  dirty, and some sort of Bad smell as soon as you enter . And the service is very bad, the staff has negative Attitude towards the Costomer! I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶"
9,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good coffee, outdoor tables and relaxed vibe!"
10,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best black coffees on the go, near the √Åmsterdam Museum and a library in a cultural spot. The taste is really incredible. Being colombian, as I am, felt a bit confused. I had a deja-v√∫ effect, feeling to have a splendid cup of coffee in Bogot√° city. Nothing less, nothing more to add."

72,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,4 years ago,(Translated by Google) They have such incredibly tasty chocolate milk here I had never tasted anything like it. Downside is that it is very pricey! ‚Ä¶
73,Coffee Company, 2 stars ,a year ago,"(Translated by Google) Delicious hot chocolate. But what grumpy staff who were especially busy with each other. I'm not likely to say that, because people usually act friendly when you act friendly too. These were exceptions. ‚Ä¶"
74,Coffee Company, 3 stars ,2 years ago,(Translated by Google) The Coffee Company always has tasty (not bitter) coffee and the vegan lemon cake was nice and fresh but the staff leaves something to be desired. Ladies were exchanging opinions about another customer. That's not ‚Ä¶
