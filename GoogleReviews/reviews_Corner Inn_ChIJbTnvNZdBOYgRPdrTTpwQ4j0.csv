0,Corner Inn, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,I guess its fair to say that when someone  orders a cup of soup you don't let it sit in the window for 10 to 15 minutes  before you bring it to the table ...no joke.  And when you offer every table but yours a drink refill there is …

35,Corner Inn, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Went here on a whim to meet some friends halfway.. the lunch buffet looked pretty rough.  There weren't many options and none of them looked particularly appetizing.  I ended up ordering a burger and my wife got the turkey pretzel club. …
