0,Bagels Sandwich Village, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Not my best breakfast experience. The place seemed quite nice, but what you get for paying 11 euros for a bagel-breakfast menu, excl. coffee/tea, wasn't worth it. Me and my partner went to have breakfast. The restaurant was full, but not …"
1,Bagels Sandwich Village, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,"On the outside it looks great and ideally.
But the prices don't match what you get.
Overall I went out with breakfast and a pit in my stomach …"
2,Bagels Sandwich Village, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was pretty average and the portions sizes as well. The wine was bad and the Entrecot wasn't tasty. The chicken was good and the fries were ok. It wasn't bad, but next time I would try another place."
3,Bagels Sandwich Village, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"On our last day in Amsterdam we were walking the streets looking for a breakfast spot. It was New Year’s Day so not much was open that early.
We came across this restaurant and figured we would try it. …"
4,Bagels Sandwich Village, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great little place, price on par with others. Nice view out front of other buildings and interior decor is warm and welcoming. Staff were quick and friendly and food was great. Couldn't fault anything really, well worth a look"
5,Bagels Sandwich Village, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The waitress was not very welcoming and prices are very high for what you get. 8€ for one simple pancake is a lot. I ordered a glass of coke and there were white stuff on the glas, don't know what it was but it was dirty. I pointed it out …"
6,Bagels Sandwich Village, 5 stars ,a year ago,The food and drinks were great here. We ordered a salmon / avocado bagel and a bacon / cheese sandwich. You must have eaten here once. The freshly prepared smoothies are also highly recommended. We have eaten here with pleasure and will definitely return.
7,Bagels Sandwich Village, 1 star ,a year ago,"Such a bad service and a bad experience. Everything started well at first. I ordererd a cappuccino and pancakes.

10,Bagels Sandwich Village, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Even for being as busy as they were, the service was excellent and the food was outstanding.  We had breakfast so the prices were on par with everywhere else in the vicinity.  First time in ages that both my wife and I actually finished EVERYTHING on the plate.  Would recommend..."
11,Bagels Sandwich Village, 1 star ,2 years ago,The owner was having an extremely though discussion with other clients after he served the wrong plates and they refused to pay. Meanwile my girlfriend and I waited more than an hour and a half for our tapas. Would definately not recommend.
12,Bagels Sandwich Village, 1 star ,2 years ago,Such a bad attitude from the staff and the portion sizes are not worth the crazy prices. Places like this need to be avoided. What is a restaurant without good food and good service? If I could give less than one star I would. Do not go here!
13,Bagels Sandwich Village, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The place and the staff were nice and friendly. But for a place that has the ""bagels"" in it's name they should step up their game. We ordered a salmon bagel, took a really long time to arrived and it was completely overworked as if the …"

15,Bagels Sandwich Village, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was way too expensive for what we got.
1! Medium sized pancake with small coffee and small orange juice for 11 Euros.

16,Bagels Sandwich Village, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Came for the all you can eat spare ribs, left very disappointed. Ribs were overcooked, almost no sauce (extra charge for additional sauce), took a long time to arrive. Felt like old frozen meat that was hastily thrown on the grill. …"
17,Bagels Sandwich Village, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I stopped there in the morning,

The food was good and everything was fine until I had to pay, …"
18,Bagels Sandwich Village, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The waiter was drunk/high and disturbed the guest behind enough to leave, the beer glass was dirty and he tried to charge us to pay for the beer twice because he already forgot that we paid for it. And keeps disturbing us by talking about nonsense and keep touching us."
19,Bagels Sandwich Village, 1 star ,2 years ago,The worst service in all of Amsterdam. Went for breakfast. The waitress had a rude attitude with every other English speaking table and served the non-English speaking table first. I would not return and would not recommend to anyone else.
20,Bagels Sandwich Village, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We stopped at this place and had salads and soups. The place was cool and relaxed, maybe a bit cold in the outer space. The waiters were nice and helpful."
21,Bagels Sandwich Village, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Had there one of the most worst burgers I've ever eaten. The bun was dry, like it was bought a few days ago and was left on the counter.
The burger was dry, overcooked and barely without any source."
22,Bagels Sandwich Village, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The waiter gave the wrong order to the cook, so we have to wait one hour to get what we really ordered. The waitress was very friendly, but the card reader did not work properly."
23,Bagels Sandwich Village, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Not too expensive and pretty good food. Definitely better as the fake Argentinean or Italian places. You notice the Spanish influences of the owner.
