0,Stach, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"I can‚Äôt speak for the other sandwiches here, but the salmon sandwich and the truffle meatball sandwich were really good. Iced coffee was great as well. Just two things to note - no seating, but across the road lots of benches. Also, we ‚Ä¶"
1,Stach, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The sandwiches are really nice, but don't bother going here if you appreciate a good cup of coffee. Today I got a medium sized cappuccino for the price of 3,80. What I got was a milk coffee which contained 90 per cent milk and 10 per cent poorly frothed milk on top."
2,Stach, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Croissants are amazing! For sure one of my favorite places to have a break,staff is super friendly and the location is great in the midst of a lively and eclectic shoppimg district"
3,Stach, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,The use plain mozzarella for the mozzarella di bufala sandwich...what a joke
4,Stach, 1 star ,7 months ago,The girls working were very unfriendly and our dinks were 85% milk. Gross. Almost feel like they did it on purpose because I interrupted their chat just by walking in.
5,Stach, 1 star ,a year ago,"I live just around the corner and actually was a loyal customer, the quality of food and coffee dropped down drastically in last year! Bread was from yesterday and the whole sandwich tasteless and dry...the coffee just bad! I am not writing ‚Ä¶"
6,Stach, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Obviously, all the food here is FABULOUS. I love STACH and the piles of sweet cakes and cookies, home-made sandwiches and other great food make this THE place for a lunch or a quick snack."
7,Stach, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely food. However, in this particular location we were served by two very rude girls. Neither of them were friendly towards any of us. We are also each charged more than the display price for sandwiches."
8,Stach, 5 stars ,10 months ago,My favorite place. Good sandwiches of really nice bread. They sell nice cakes and cookies. Chai latte is very good!!
9,Stach, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great coffee, location right next to uni buildings."
10,Stach, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"All sandwiches cost 5.5 euro, makes it easy to order. Brown bread-Carpaccio with avocado(+extra) sandwich recommended! It gets Toooooo crowded at lunch breaks. A line to the left - for ordering and a line to the right - for picking up the order. It's a take-away place."
11,Stach, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A place where you can find scrumptious pastries. A good place to drop by to satisfy your confectionaries craving.
12,Stach, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Forgive me, as a stranger to this city. Egg white sweets is too expensive, 3.75euro each. I'm disappointed because they're not tasty, too sweet and the inside is still wet and had the raw egg scent."
13,Stach, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Sandwiches are always really good and decently priced. Some fresh foods are a bit too pricey. Cooled craft beer is quite cheap on the other side.
14,Stach, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent enough coffee but the juices and smoothies are very overpriced, approx. 5EUR per bottle. Otherwise good food but much higher quality places available elsewhere."
15,Stach, 5 stars ,4 years ago,If I could bottle the smell of the fresh-baked treats form here I'd be *SOOO* perfectly happy. ‚Ä¶
16,Stach, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It‚Äôs a nice chained grab and go coffee shop. They have pretty good coffee and a variety of pastries and sweet snacks.
17,Stach, 1 star ,2 years ago,don't reccommend the chai latte. cold and no chai tea flavor at all for 4 euros
18,Stach, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious sandwiches. Great cookies brownies macaroons and a lovely view of the flower market.
19,Stach, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a super tasty avocado (pumpkin) bread sandwich, followed by a nice banana bread....so, I was happy."
20,Stach, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A Stach is a Stach, of course. Full of baked treats, sandwiches, and good coffee."
21,Stach, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"A limited selection of pastries and bakery treats, but the stroop waffles were excellent."
22,Stach, 1 star ,3 years ago,14 euros for a couple of VERY dry and tasteless cakes and two thin ice coffees. Not recommended.
23,Stach, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The sandwich was nice, but the staff was very rude. Must work on their welcoming attitude."
24,Stach, 5 stars ,a year ago,Stach sell the most incredible jackfuit and avocado sandwich!
25,Stach, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"First time trying it. Overall, really good. A bit on the pricey side for some of the snacks."
