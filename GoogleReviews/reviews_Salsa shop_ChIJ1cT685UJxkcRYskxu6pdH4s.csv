0,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"The staff is super friendly and helped me decide the sauces based on my preferences. The tacos, were wonderfully amazing and tasted super delicious.
The prices are as well very cheap compared to other Mexican cuisine restaurants. ‚Ä¶"
1,Salsa shop, 1 star ,3 months ago,"07/12 16:00

To pay ‚Ç¨15 for a bowl with extra's and I get 1 spoon of rice and a little piece ‚Ä¶"
2,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great staff nice food. Always good to go back for more.
Spicy good be more spicy for me."
3,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Really Good burritos very similar to chipotle.
We had barbacoa and chicken burritos, also steak tacos.
The meat was very good quality and salsa selection great. It is an extra 2 euro ‚Ä¶"
4,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really good bowls and burritos.

The ingredients are made onsite which guarantees freshness. I would recommend ‚Ä¶"
5,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Been here a couple times now. I'm from southern California so it's a big challenge to find a place that is anywhere as tasty as a nice carne asada burrito, but Salsa Shop it very very good. Nice meat, fresh guac, good selection of hot sauce. I like it a lot."
6,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Decent service, although my burrito was not rolled very well at all. Good selection of salsas (as you'd hope based on the name) and the lemonade is delicious. I would have liked for them to have brown rice as an option. Pleasant interior ‚Ä¶"
7,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The burritos are great but it is their burrito bowl that is the star! Comparing it to Chipotle would be a shame because it is much, much better than Chipotle. Beautiful, fresh ingredients and the sauces are HOT! One of my favourite places in Amsterdam, I recommend it to anyone heading there."
8,Salsa shop, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good price for the portion you get. The place is more of one stop to get your food and go. Quick service, quite tasty meals. Several locations around Amsterdam (also at kinkerstraat). Good, quick choice if your are looking for grabbing something to eat."
9,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,It was open til late which was lucky enough! It was past 10 I think and we were starving. Life saver. Ordered a super delicious burrito bowl. Worth the price.
10,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place for a vegetarian. It‚Äôs hygienic, tasty and healthy. Staff is good and welcoming, drinks are good and burritos are ahhhmazing! #holysalsa"
11,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, well priced, good value. If you want fresh ingredients in Burrito, Burrito Bowl, Taco or salad form your found your place!"
12,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good Mexican food, staff is friendly. if you can't eat gluten try the burrito bowl with steak and Chipotle sauce."
13,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had beef taco. Big amount of meat put inside taco. Numerous varieties of fillings and sauces. Taco is packed well. Doesn‚Äôt leak and stays warm for a long time (the road home took 40 minutes and it was still warm). I love the bag as it was ‚Ä¶
14,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, the place is very quiet, but the WiFi internet is not working. If you like guacamole ask to be aside to the burrito, they will give you two spoons of guacamole instead one"
15,Salsa shop, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"They seemed awfully short-staffed. No chips available when I visited. Flavours were just okay, and ingredients not mixed together well... I felt dissatisfied when I finished my burrito. Making good Mexican-style food is not that difficult; I'm not entirely sure what went wrong. I would not recommend this restaurant."
16,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful mexicana restaurant. Many options you can choose (also vegan). The stuff is also very friendly. 5 stars no doubt.
17,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Tried the burritos and tacos - both fantastic. The lemonade, chips, guac and salsa are also on fleek üëå. Recommended!"
18,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very funny and friendly staff, our service was delayed, so they gave us french fries for free while waiting. The food is nice and the portions are quite big"
19,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Veggie burrito! Yes, I recently became a vegetarian and if you are craving for a nice meal (in my case breakfast!) you should definitely try the Salsa Shop's veggie burrito. It's easy to eat, super tasty and very satisfying. From now on its Burrito Tuesday üéâ"
20,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is an easy and quick way to get some good Mexican food. I'm in love with their burritos and it's not even expensive to get it with loads of toppings and such. They have a small place to sit which isn't very special, but is ‚Ä¶"
21,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I'm from Arizona which borders Mexico and naturally has some of the best Mexican food in the world outside of Mexico. This is a close second, friendly staff, fresh and authentic ingredients, and spicy salsa!:) Even with a rather long line the service was very quick"
22,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It‚Äôs a more expensive, less tasty Chipotlesque location.  The food is ok.  Prices are a bit ridiculous ($2 extra for some peppers and onions??). ‚Ä¶"
23,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very tasty. Though I was unlucky to arrive just as the one staff picked up the phone; it took him a good 3 minutes to acknowledge me and go get a colleague to help me. She was very apologetic on his behalf though so it helped. I still think the guy was rude. But food was good.
24,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great burritos, loved their own lemonade. Salsa tasted good, not too hot unless you take the 5 star salsa, but they even warn you, as it is only for people who really love hot food."
25,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fresh quality food, really like the place it has that ""Chipotle"" feeling to it, keep the good work!"
26,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great for a quick snack. Fresh ingredients used and their salsa's taste amazing. I have tried their veggie burrito and tacos. For around 8 euros each, they were quite filling."
27,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The tacos are pretty good.  In fact, they're the best I've found since moving to Europe.  However, I'm from the West coast of the US, so I know what a real taco is, and this is close, but not quite.  The staff were very friendly and the prices were reasonable."
28,Salsa shop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very bad experience. The guy working downstairs said ‚Äúeverything is going wrong‚Äù at one point. It seems like it‚Äôs the girls first day and she doesn‚Äôt know how to wrap a burrito. Then a random guy comes in, orders with the chef and cuts me, ‚Ä¶"
29,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"After almost 40 days in Europe, I was in search of some familiar ""American"" food that was not ""fast food."" This place is about as close to a Chipotle as you can get without it being called that. They have the same process, taste, and similar prices as Chipotle. It was very yummy and a nice reminder of home."
30,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The food was delicious, the lady working there was super kind, really good prices,and also, the atmosphere and the environment was very cozy. 10/10 would recommend !!"
31,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice food and very friendly staff. Loved it so much I came back the second day again. ‚Ä¶
32,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Visiting here was a pleasant experience overall. I did not have much expectations walking in but the people present at the time were very friendly and I got a good vibe from everyone around me. Nice Mexican food and fresh with tons of hot sauces
33,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very delicious Mexican food! I ordered a chicken burrito with guacamole and chips on the side. Can't complain about anything. The food was super tasty, the restaurant is in a great location, and the atmosphere is pleasant. Highly recommend it!"
34,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love Salsa Shop. Better than Taco Bell hands down. Today I decided to go to the one on Amstelstraat. I told Melissa, who works there, that I ordered take out from here two weeks ago and that I always get my usual order. Veggie burrito ‚Ä¶"
35,Salsa shop, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The food is okay. This is pretty much Chipotle but not as good and a little more expensive with less portion. The steak is bland and definitely not fresh but the spiciest salsa was actually very good.
36,Salsa shop, 1 star ,10 months ago,"UPDATE
Service was good, food is okay and they prepared our orders quickly which is great for office lunch. We already asked the girl, but PLEASE replace those dark ‚Ä¶"
37,Salsa shop, 2 stars ,2 years ago,I've been coming here for a while but it seems the level of service and quite is in slight decline. I spoke dutch but was told 'only English' in manner that wasn't too welcoming. Also the 3rd choice was already  done for me and when I ‚Ä¶
38,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Inexpensive meals that taste great and are a good value. There are lots of options from bowels, to tacos and burritos. Try the habenero peach salsa. Like many spiced dishes in Amsterdam it is not as spicy as Mexico or many US locating but still a wonderful flavor. Ask for a sample of any salsa if in doubt."
39,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love Salsa Shop. Good burritos that are full of fresh ingredients, handmade in front of you. My partner regularly saves a third of the burrito for later - so it's a big meal and not too expensive."
40,Salsa shop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I gave this place a 5x star review in the past but *wow* has it gone down the toilet.
My friend ordered a Veggie burrito which was lacking in flavor, the salsa was ‚Ä¶"
41,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Really like the food! Minus 1 star because this particular location historically hasn't been fast (or large) enough to serve the queue (if 8 people are ordering ahead of you then you'll be standing outside the door). Seating is limited but nice.
42,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We got burritos, tacos and rice bowl. Taste was good, choice of sauces were new. Portions were filling enough except the rice bowl. A little more rice and beans would do! The Cholula brand of hot sauces were for sale. Grabbed a chilli garlic one for 5euros."
43,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"36/5000
Perfect burrito, friendly service."
44,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Love a good taco and this place definitely hit the spot ! Super fresh ingredients, nice variety of toppings, beer and margaritas are on offer as well and a cosy interior. If you order vegetarian you get guacamole complimentary üòÅ will be ‚Ä¶"
45,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"DELICIOUS! Fresh and simple ingredients, large portions. Definitely recommend!
PS: their spiciest salsa is actually not that spicy, go for it"
46,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great burritos, tacos and fair prices for big portions"
47,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Like a better Dutch version of chipotle. Amazing for quick food with lots of healthy options. The steak was amazing quality for a fast food place. Salad bowls, bowls, burritos, and tacos. Also the homemade lemonade is a huge plus."
48,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Burritos are fresh and tasty - a lot of options. Different salsas, the hottest could be more spicy. ‚Ä¶"
49,Salsa shop, 1 star ,2 years ago,Food didn't have any taste. The staff are not hygienic. I asked for a drink and the bottle came covered in guacamole because they take the food with their hands and they also handle money without changing gloves (it's just a mess). The toilet didn't have a lock.
50,Salsa shop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Wow, this place has gone downhill! I've been to the Central Station one and de Pijp one recently and they were still okay, but the Rembrandtplein one has turned into a giant joke. ‚Ä¶"
51,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice Burritos. It's a simple place but that's all it needs. The atmosphere is nice and the tables are clean. I really like the yellow habanero salsa üå∂Ô∏è
52,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious! Not cheap but the sizes of the meal and the  taste make up for it.
On of the first times the vegetarian and the meat eater enjoyed the food the same. :D"
53,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great food and great delivery!
54,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Was wandering Amsterdam killing time before a flight and stubbled upon this place. I wasn't expecting much since Mexican food in Europe can be pretty dire, but the yellow habanero salsa actually kept the promise they made of being both very fiery but with loads of flavor"
55,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A great place that allows you to pick and create various combinations at a decent price. The ingredients are fresh, and well spiced. I picked the spiciest sauce, and it definitely delivered. It's worth coming back to try out other combinations. There's also vegetarian/vegan options."
56,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is pretty good when you're hankering for that cheesy goodness. It's one of my go to lunch places and it's usually quick to do a take out run, but there's also indoor dining if that's your thing. ‚Ä¶"
57,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good burritos, big portions. Don't take the spiciest sauce unless you're really confident in your ability to handle it - it's *REALLY* hot. There's nice Mexican sauces on the tables to add later. Try the Hibiscus water"
58,Salsa shop, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Not great. Not sure why it's so popular. Nothing special, just a more expensive copy of Chipotle for those that know the chain. The only plus was the sauces are great and they have a good variety of them."
59,Salsa shop, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Best burritos in town. I especially like the one with steak with some chipotle sauce. The tortilla's are a little small however. ‚Ä¶
60,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I love this place, the portions are rather big and can keep you satisfied for an entire day. Lots of combinations available. I love that they make the guacamole free for vegetarians/vegans. Can't recommend this place enough!"
61,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Wow. Got a burrito; totally worth it. Expect to spend 10 euros per person including a drink. You will be filled to the brim with very yummy food!  Plus they've got Jarritos!
62,Salsa shop, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Over time things have slipped a bit. My last visit was a bit of a disaster, as they had run out of 2 ingredients for a burrito and would not substitute anything (guacamole) in their place, while charging full price."
63,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Surprisingly good. As good as Chipotle in the States. Dare I say better? A clear indication of Californian/Mexican taste. Los Angeles-native approved. That‚Äôs not easy guys. Nicely done!
64,Salsa shop, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"It's more Mexican than some TexMex places, but it's not great. The Burritos are focused on volume, not taste, so they work well for fast food audience, but if you come to eat something tasty, you'd better skip. The 3 tacos in corn tortillas ‚Ä¶"
65,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing! Just like chipotle. Maybe even better
66,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Decent Chipotle-like burritos. If you have time in Amsterdam go to Tomatillo instead, but if you're in the neighbourhood definitely check it out. ‚Ä¶"
67,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very friendly staff. The texmex food as good as in Texas. This is a fast-food restaurant with the quality of a great one. Satisfaction guaranteed as long as you like mexican food indeed....
68,Salsa shop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Super slow service, those guys looked in another world.i don't understand how you can be so not energic even though very young. By the time they rolled my burrito It was Freezing cold! I was standing there and getting frustrated,my unrolled burrito was Just ignored and left there. Not worth the money"
69,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Burrito's are packed with fresh ingredients of your choice. The yellow habanero sauce is indeed really spicy. So if you fancy hot stuff, this is the one for you."
70,Salsa shop, 1 star ,6 years ago,"It' was very expensive comparing price and size, concept like chipotle in us but the size of burrito only half of it and it was almost cold. Guacamole was made out crude avokados you could smell it, It's too expensive for quick bite burrito"
71,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best chopped steak I have had in Amsterdam.
Good variety of choices in sauces and filling.
The place was nice and clean and the staff were nice"
72,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"O hot damn this is my jam. Absolutely love this place, great staff, amazing food. Salsa shop is slowly taking over Amsterdam and for a good reason. Price and quality are great and I can guarranty a good meal at this specific restaurant. (Thanks for always being so nice to me, kind regards, Tom the Deliveroo boy.)"
73,Salsa shop, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Tortillas are cold by the time you get your meal. Tortillas not good. The fillings are good especially Barbacoa and Steak.  Veggies is not good.  Service very flat.
74,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice burritos, clean, and reasonably priced"
75,Salsa shop, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This place used to be great but now they are so stingy with the portion sizes and widely inconsistent, it‚Äôs beyond a waste of money to eat hear on the way home from work. ‚Ä¶"
76,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is nothing more than a nock off  Chipotle actually exactly which could be bad for them if Chipotle decides to sue them even though the name is different. Either way solid food maybe even better than Chipotle so maybe they should take some pointers before suing them.
77,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Absolute fantastic food and dito service. Giving Mexican taco's a whole new dimension: clean, fast and healthy, with their home-made fantastic sauces & dips as the spicy cherry on the cake."
78,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Like the Dutch version of Chipotle, with better salsa options! The hibiscus water is really tasty and refreshing and the portions are enough to fill you up and then some."
79,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The social media promotion wasn't in effect yet so I went through all the trouble of:
Taking my phone out my pocket ‚Ä¶"
80,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I love Mexican food and most of the food in Europe was for weak stomach who can't handle spicy food. I had 3 days of food with no chili and the food of this place cheer up my stomach! Ha haa
81,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food was great but they have this weird rule where they don't take cash. It seems lazy to use the excuse that people come with big notes. It annoyed a lot if people and the staff themselves weren't convinced although they kept repeating the exvuse.
82,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We came in with a bunch of people so it took quite long but the wait was worth it: The burritos were delicious and big enough for a whole meal.
83,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very fresh and delicious! You can drive tacos, burritos and bowls in different styles. Also, there are really nice veggy options."
84,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The ingredients were simple and fresh while the salsa options were plentiful and delicous. One of my favourite burritos ever!
85,Salsa shop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst service, I ordered two menus on the phone and they delivered just one, I called the week after and same thing happened. Incredible. They gave me a voucher that I can‚Äôt use because no one picks up the phone there. Avoid!"
86,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Been to this shop twice, every time I go to Amsterdam I love it the smell is beautiful. We went late at night and try gave us extra meat because they were running out of other things! I think they should be open later"
87,Salsa shop, 3 stars ,5 years ago,The burritos are really good but horribly wrapped. The staff are clearly not trained properly so they overstuff the wrap. This makes the burritos impossible to eat. A real pity.
88,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Closest thing to chipotle I could find. Very tasty tacos
89,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place was so good!! When we first walked in, we were starving and walked past a man out front trying to give away a bowl for free because he was ""trying out the new packaging"" and we felt really bad for saying no after realizing he worked there. I would highly recommend this to others."
90,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"It's not Chipotle, but it's a good substitute when the closest Chipotle is a few hours away.  The ingredients are fresh, the staff is nice, and the food is good but it's a pricey for the amount of food you get."
91,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I like the fact that you have the freedom to chose your ingredients. That however limits the options. Food is tasty but it's very rich - I recommend sharing.
92,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent place for meals /snack. Warm staff, delicious and nutritious menu. Can hang out with friends over a beer."
93,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Highly recommend the Tacos so good and full of flavor but if I am really hungry the burrito do the job
94,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food for a very good price. You can create your own dish by selecting the ingredients. Nice atmosphere.
95,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really awesome place with friendly and fast staff. :) Cheap, good and filling food. My favourite one is the vegetarian wrap. :D"
96,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A chipotle clone that will ward off a craving
97,Salsa shop, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Hmm... moderate place, with moderate food. The staff was kind enough but the food not so good. What it was really bad...they handle with the same gloves money, food, garbage and their hair... Disgusting!!"
98,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I ate chicken burrito, and it was delicious~
You can choose extra toppings and sauce.
The staffs were friendly.
There are enough seats."
99,Salsa shop, 1 star ,2 years ago,"You have to remind the staff of free guac for the veggie burrito and the salsa, which apparently is in the name of the company but not the burritos they serve... Had to pay extra for this, terrible."
100,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favorite places to eat in Amsterdam. Very similar to Chipotle, but that is why I like it. I get the carnitas burrito every time."
101,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Simple but tasty, staff is friendly. Beer choice is very small though. Good place to meet with few friends overall."
102,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Pretty similar to Chipotle (if you‚Äôre from the US). I‚Äôve been looking for something to fill my need for spice and the hottest made my eyes water!! Delicious!!
103,Salsa shop, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I love the salsa shop, but this particular salsa shop sucks....they run out of different items two hours before closing...these workers need to take a lesson at the franchise at Amsterdam Zuid"
104,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"A very decent burrito joint, with fine ingredients and an interesting choice of salsas. I only know one person who finished a meal with Fiery Yellow Habanero salsa."
105,Salsa shop, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Workers refused to make a simple cheese quesadilla for my youngest child. The family ate at seperate restaurants. Won't go back.
106,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Quick service, good varieties, delicious fod for a good price. Build your own burrito or taco from the offered ingredients."
107,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great interior. Really good food, friendly staff and an awesome atmosphere. Loved the lemonade. Highly recommended if you visit Amsterdam!"
108,Salsa shop, 1 star ,3 years ago,*closed at 9pm on Sunday ‚Äî Took 30 minutes to get here and found out they close at 9 on Sunday‚Äôs what a bummer! Would have made other arrangements for dinner with my friends before a movie.  They could have offered us dinner to go so we could eat it on the square - but flat out closed.  I just updated google with the new time.
109,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cheap, quick, the fast meal you want to have nearby. Go for Carnitas + cheese + sourcream + salsa. Say no to veggies!"
110,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great tasty, fresh food and lovely service. Based on my two visits I would definitely recommend."
111,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"OH MY GOD SO GOOD. Lots of choices for vegans and carnivores alike, incredible selection for burritos and food, at a fairly reasonable price (for Amsterdam at least)."
112,Salsa shop, 1 star ,2 years ago,We got our lunch today and the staff‚Äôs attitude was absolutely appalling. All 3 of us asked a question and all three of us were snubbed for even asking. Will not be going again.
113,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food is delicious and it has that Mexican flavor...The staff is very friendly and they make sure that you enjoy your meal .
114,Salsa shop, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is quite good, prices are ok. The service gravitates between horrible/sedate/condescending and the unusual great treatment. I'd suggest a bit more training to some in the staff."
115,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Beef and sides really good, try the hot üöí salsa.  Chicken not so exciting.  Fast food: plastic cutlery, paper plates, etc."
116,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Will update with Pok√©stop status in the future.

My favorite burrito in Amsterdam and I'd say they compare to great burritos anywhere."
117,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really good quality of the food, with fresh ingredients. The portions are big and the hottest sauce is REALLY spicy!"
118,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The service was really quick. The burritos were nice and worth the price. Great place for a quick meal.
119,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Even though my carnitas burrito was rather dry, it was still better than most of the Mexican food in Britain, so take that for what it's worth."
120,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious food, great taste of the chicken, meat and the salsas are hilarious! Price is ok for the food, I would definitely come back."
121,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,a year ago,"California native, lived here for a year and went to this place for my Mexican fix twice a month. The only place in town that has Cholula!"
122,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best mole enchiladas I have had in the Netherlands.  Fresh sauce, freshly made tortillas."
123,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A very very tasty shop with low prizes for Amsterdam. I loved eating there, and you'll definitely have to try the homemade lemonade"
124,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Pretty good Burrito üåØ Not the best I have eaten but a pretty tasty and healthy option for a Friday night after cocktails Friday!
125,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,6 years ago,My go to place in Amsterdam. Fresh. Tasty.Big portions.Lots of delicious sauces to choose from. Love the Fiery Habanero sauce.
126,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent customer service, incredible food that was expertly wrapped and a phenomenal atmosphere. Couldn't recommend this place more."
127,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love their Burrito bowls, highly recommend if you want some quality fast food."
128,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice range of salsa flavours. Must recommended for a burrito or just salsa and chips.
129,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Loved this place it reminded me of chipotle back home in America! It was healthy didn‚Äôt weigh me down and very fresh and good.
130,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food great, but not heating if its rainy and cold outside."
131,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was good, but the beer was warm and the food cold. I'll be back though. Great potential! Need a DH location."
132,Salsa shop, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Flavorless Chipotle Ripoff. Barbacoa well cooked but needs seasoning. Rice is plain. Beans have no seasoning. Guacamole is plain avocado.
133,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,That was by FAR the best Mexican Food i ever ate! Not cheap but worth the Price for sure.
134,Salsa shop, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food was not nice, when they openend few years it was great portion a smaller also taste not the same. Not coming back anymore"
135,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent and busy Mexican Kitchen - Burritos particularly good. Plenty of seating

Value for the money- 5 stars
Amazing salsas and toppings"
140,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely spot with best Mexican food in Amsterdam. Burritos are insanely big, so one is enough :)"
141,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Its like a Dutchified version of Chipotle! Great food and they also support Cholula hot sauce!
142,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fast service, great food, not too expensive. Like Subway but for Mexican food."
143,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice and easy atmosphere, oke food. Perfect for a quick bite and larger groups"
144,Salsa shop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Surprising good Taco's for the price!
The woman behind the counter was very friendly as well!"
145,Salsa shop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good, cheap food, don't recommend getting an overpriced drink. The male bathroom could use a lock."
