2,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 1 star ,a month ago,Ordered off of Grub Hub. They charge $17 for six small pieces of lamb and a pinky worth of salad. They don’t even include rice and naan bread like other Indian restaurants. The lamb was also really chewy and burnt on some parts. Will not order from here again.
3,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Very nicely decorated. Clean and good service. I liked their food. Chicken tandoori lacked a little flavor but it wasn't too bad. Curry was good so was the vegetable.

10,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 1 star ,a week ago,Apparently the curry doesn’t come with rice. Never heard of this before! Not going back.
11,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 2 stars ,a year ago,Good food but charges extra for rice and naan in opposition to what is posted on their website. Does bother to inform you the rice and naan is extra cost.

19,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 3 stars ,7 months ago,So many of my samosas were opening up and broken. Not inexpensive at all!  I think  its overpriced for very average food.
20,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Outstanding Indian food with great service. I have not ever been disappointed here.  I must eat here once a week.  Tonight I had shrimp vindaloo which I have not ever tried before -- it was excellent.  The staff truly tries to give great …
21,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This restaurant is my favorite. I eat in plenty of restaurants but to this restaurant I  constantly return again and again. The team is very amicable and the food they offer is so delicious. I would always prefer to have a decent dinner in this restaurant. Highly recommended.
22,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great food here I definitely recommend this place if you like Indian food and even if you haven't tried it. It is a great place to try Indian food I doubt you'll be disappointed
23,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Place is just okay. The host was a little rude when I asked if I could sit at the bar. The server was nice and helpful. The lamb was excellent. The garlic naan did not taste like garlic whatsoever. And the rice was just okay. Probably wouldn't see me back in this place.
24,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 3 stars ,a year ago,"This place can have so much potential the staff was bad and always laughing at their jokes?. The food at least was good but pricey the restaurant has a lot of space that was mostly empty. You have to bring your own alcohol, the restroom smells."
25,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Bollywood is the best Indian food restaurant in the valley!  I love the chicken tikka masala and the vegetarian dishes are some of the best I've ever tasted.  The restaurant is lively, fun and the service is friendly and quick while the prices are quite reasonable.  So glad it's our neighborhood restaurant!"

27,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best Indian food in the valley. I love the korma and the tills masala and the naan. Mostly just get those cause they’re amazing but we’re there a lot. Tried other places but they don’t compare! We always come back to Bollywood Indian!
28,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I only tried 2 different things there. Malia Kofta and Chicken Korma. The sauces of both dishes were very tasty. But the chicken was very dry inside. Also if you order take out the amount of food you get is less than if you eat there …
29,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I am a huge Indian food lover.  This place is great!  They make the food however spicy you want. I recently stopped eating red meat so had to cut out lamb vindaloo (my favorite!!) but thought I would try the shrimp.  So pleasantly …

32,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Super friendly staff. Food was fresh, delicious, served promptly. Clean."
33,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good Indian food. Must try their delicious coconut naan. They can't serve alcohol at this branch because of a nearby school. Pleasant enough ambience.
34,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great service, the staff is always so polite and attentive. The food is consistently good. My favorite Indian restaurant in Sherman Oaks and we have a lot of them here!"
35,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Nice service, but the food was just terrible. Even the sauces that they put on the table were unedable. We travel the world for Indian restaurants, and these people certainly have lost any quality that we might have completely... Save your money and go elsewhere."
36,Bollywood Indian Restaurant, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"(Delivery via Eat24) Sauce for tikka and curry (bhuna) was bland, very very bland. No flavor but salt and spice. The meat was dry. Had high hopes are seeing all the reviews on Google and eat 24 and was really disappointed. Will no be ordering from them again. Still edible and didn't make me sick so two stars."
