0,WG Cafe, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice spot, worth a visit! Located in the courtyard of a former hospital, surrounded by beautiful buildings. Off the city center therefore peaceful ; recommended when you need to take a break from the busy downtown. A little more expensive than average in Amsterdam for this kind of food (otherwise 5 stars) but still worth a visit."
