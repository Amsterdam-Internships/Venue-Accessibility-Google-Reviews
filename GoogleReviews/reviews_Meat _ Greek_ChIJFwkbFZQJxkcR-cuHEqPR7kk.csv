0,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,a month ago,We had an incredibly delicious meat and pita meal! Not traditional Greek but a modern take on a gyro that was absolutely incredible. Also a very generous portion size.
1,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great spot for a very quick and tasty bite to eat. I love the veggie meat substitute and am hooked on the Chefs Choice with Fig Jam and Feta! The northern soul and classic soul music is great too. Big shout out to their staff, they are super friendly, it's a blessing"
2,Meat & Greek, 3 stars ,2 months ago,"Very delicious food, the Classic and the one with fig Jam are delicious. The (new) prices are too high though, 11 euros for a pita and 16 euro for the dish... There are similar places further up the street with the same quality and a much better price.."
3,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Lovely and cozy place with great staff! As soon as we arrived they offered us some appetizers with their great sauces in order to allow us to make up our mind on our order. Great gyro and delicious sauces. ‚Ä¶
4,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"The chef‚Äôs favorite in Pita is out of this world.
Everything tastes fresh specially the bread.
Highly recommended."
5,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,7 months ago,nice place to grab a quick lunch. you can pick your own mix or order their signature mixes. friendly staff
6,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Very tasty and well prepared greek food. Great for a quick and easy bite in the city to relax and enjoy some delicious food. Highly recommend adding the fig jam to your order. It adds a lovely touch to the already great food :) Dining in ‚Ä¶
7,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very nice place in the center of Ansterdam! The pita-gyros sandwich comes in variety of fillings. The meat is great!!! The sauces are handmade , so don't expect any ketchup or fried potatoes, cause here only quality food is served! The owner is very friendly!"
8,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I had the MOST AMAZING TIME. Seriously. I biked all day, I was tired and hungry. We took two specials with pork and sausage. The dishes were prepared quick, we didn't really wait and the food was perfect. Great meat, really generous ‚Ä¶"
9,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Tasty and not pricey, great fit for on the go lunches. The vegan option is good."
10,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"I brought a colleague here who has never had any food like this before and we both thought it was delicious. The restaurant is a little small but has great ambiance and fantastic staff, highly recommend."
11,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 months ago,A small but welcoming place where you can find delicious food. Super friendly staff serve you big portions here. ‚Ä¶
12,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"I almost don‚Äôt want to publish a review, because I don‚Äôt want this place to be flooded with people, but they really deserve all the cred in the world. Not only do they have the most delicious food (I‚Äôm looking at you chef‚Äôs choice), but the ‚Ä¶"
13,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"üëåüèº recommend!! Great menu, i tried the Hot Greek Pita and it has a great spicy kick to it. Meat was tender, awesome portion size.  Great staff, fast service."
14,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best Gyros in Amsterdam. Freshly sliced gyros and fresh toppings. Staff wear masks and gloves.
15,Meat & Greek, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Gyros were over priced, cold and lacked flavour but was edible unlike a lot of the other places I had visited. Not sure if you can really call it a gyro, no fries and you have to pay extra for tzatziki."
16,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Very good gyros. It has much more ingredients then the ones you can eat in Greece, whether it's good or bad I guess it's personal. We ordered with extra meat and it didn't really look that big, I'd think that's more of a regular amount. Nevertheless if you're searching for gyros that's the place to check out."
17,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Just a really good gyro pita. The best part about this place is the consistency. I've ordered a dozen times and the pita is always stuffed, always the way I order, and always delicious!"
18,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really high quality food and great service. The wrap sandwich is delicious, especially with the ziki sauce. Also the pita bread is very fresh tasting, not something you could find in the grocery store. ‚Ä¶"
19,Meat & Greek, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Very small place with very high prices. The staff was kind but the food was very salty and very greasy. I wouldn't go again. I am sure there are better Greek places in Amsterdam for the same or lower price.
20,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious pita!! I discovered this place wandering in Amsterdam and asked the owner if it was like what I call ""kebab"". He was so right when answering ""it's better"" ! The food is fresh and delicious and the service welcoming and extra extra ‚Ä¶"
21,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, very friendly staff, has only fee tables. You can have set plates or compose your dish. As it is very small, they are not allowed to serve alcohol. For that you have to go to their second restaurant."
22,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Incredible food and fast, friendly service. Lovely decor and atmosphere. The only improvement they could make is selling Fritz Diet Cola as well as Fritz Fanta, but that doesn‚Äôt affect the high rating!"
23,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Incredibly tasty food, great service. They even threw in a Greek yoghurt dessert for myself and my boyfriend, very generous. Loved this place!"
24,Meat & Greek, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great cosy sitting area, right in De pijp close the shops and public transport. The food was ok- well done meat for the gyros, but the pita bread was a little on the dry side. Fresh toppings and a variety to chose from."
25,Meat & Greek, 3 stars ,6 months ago,As a greek guy all i had to say is that it was overpriced.The best thing was the pita(the bread around gyros) and i strongly recommend that your gyros shouldn't be so marinated inside the pita even if it's tasty on its own.take some advise of a man that had over 10000 pita gyros in his life.
26,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Not your average gyros! These brilliant minds add fig chutney to the mix, and frankly: it's a game changer. Order their Chef's favorite, and I promise, it'll be your favorite too."
27,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazingly delicious Greek pitas with a fun and friendly staff. We dined in at the little 20 seat restaurant. ‚Ä¶
28,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent Pita, very delicious! The owner is German and makes his gyros by himself fresh every day! Would definitely come here again!"
29,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely and cozy place with great staff! As soon as we arrived they offered us some appetizers with their great sauces in order to allow us to make up our mind on our order. Great gyro and delicious sauces. ‚Ä¶
30,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"YUM! Can order for take away which is great. Plus there are vegetarian options!! The food was really yummy, I wish I could have eaten there more while in the city"
31,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The chef's special is definitely my favourite. Gyro meat is super tasty, perfect when craving for full flavour and you are super hungry. Veggie options are available. Meat the king in the photo is perfect to share."
32,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We came here, fresh off of our train from Paris, looking for a quick bite to eat. ‚Ä¶"
33,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to decompress from all the sights and sounds of Amsterdam, if your looking for lunch or light meal.  Lovely and helpful staff, Vegan/Vegi options which is important, and cosy seating out the backs - loved it. Was a accidental find, and would definitely go again and recommend."
34,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food ans staff! Fresh and juicy. Fully crouded place. I had Chef‚Äôs Favourite dish. Was big enough for big guy like I am. Special thanks for good mood for Rokas - soul of a restaurant.
35,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Delicious gyros! I've been here a few times with my older son and we always enjoy it a lot. Looks as good in the flesh as it does in the adverts.
36,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best vegeterian Gyros I have ever eaten. We even called the owner to make sure we did not get meat version by mistake üòÇ We applauded over the phone when we found out it was vegeterian. This place is unique greek mageek
37,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The vegetarian option is a chicken substitute that is pretty tasty. I don‚Äôt normally opt for the fake meat so I donut have much to compare it to but I guess I would do it again. The pita wrap as a whole was delicious. Was different than your typical pita wrap in Greek but still good for the soul when missing gyro pitas.
38,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing place, great food, and the owner is a true gentleman who went out of his way to help us."
39,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We've had a very nice meal, really tasty and although we had to wait a bit for our plates, it was totally worth it and the waiter offered us a dessert to make up for the delay. Highly recommend!"

41,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Friendly service, very short waiting time, tasty food :)"
42,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing food, we got a little greek yoghurt with honey and walnuts and a fresh coca cola on a scorching day. Exactly what you need, big recommendation"
43,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It's one of those places where you come back because you know the staff cares for your experience. Oh yeah, the gyros are unquestionably awesome. Especially if you love feta cheese! :)"
44,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was amazing, close your eyes and you are definitely in Greece! The taste of all flavours! The staff is very kind, special mention for Matteo who is really cool!"
45,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Darn good food. Found this gem on accident but I‚Äôm glad I did. Small little eat in that‚Äôs off the main drag. Probably not ideal for large groups but it was my wife and I. Would definitely eat here again.
46,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Best gyros in town. Hands down. Amazing service as well, def recommend"
47,Meat & Greek, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Meat was too dry and oversolty. If to compare to old-style Turkish well-done duner, than Meat &Greek is also overpriced."
48,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,They serve a super good gyros. It's not cheap but the quality of ingredients really makes a difference. The dish versions are huge.
49,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fresh and trendy, this new business is already proven to be successful with Amsterdam's. Everything is home made and fresh. I love it."
50,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Coming from Greece I would never imagine that I would eat in Amsterdam the best souvlaki ever. The chef marinates the meat every single day as he told me and you could easily tell from the taste that this is not a marketing trick but ‚Ä¶
51,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"A very organized place. The gyros, both kip and pork are in a high level. The salad bar is amazing. Fast food in its best!!!"
52,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I have never tried something like this in my entire life! That fluffly pita bread, amazing tzatziki (everyone should try!), and vegeterian CHICKEN?? YES, it taste exactly like chicken, but its 100 % SOYA! Staff explained me everything very ‚Ä¶"
53,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Real Greek food and real Greek hospitality! Came from Germany for couple days and were amazed  by the vegetarian ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù options ! The owner was adorable and gave us tips on how to prepare Soja substitute at home ! Would love to have a a store open up in Germany! ŒïœÖœáŒ±œÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœçŒºŒµ œÄŒøŒªœç !

62,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,9 months ago,My go-to is the ‚Äúchef-favourite‚Äù but with the vegetarian ‚Äòmeat‚Äô. Food is delicious and staff are very friendly. Only drawback is the take-away box is made from styrofoam :(
63,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Very tasty gyros. The bread itself is amazing
64,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing pita, good mix and quality of ingredients!

72,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A last minute choice and quick internet search from our hotel.

74,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So glad I stumbled upon this place the old school way. While walking down the street hungry, I noticed this cute place half filled with people. The menu looked promising and I was welcomed inside by friendly inviting staff.Got a gyro pita ‚Ä¶"

79,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What a pleasant surprise!  Best gyros ever!!!  Pita was fresh, the pork was scrumptious, the feta was fresh from Greece and so good it must have come from the happiest cows on the planet!  The restaurant while small was immaculately clean. ‚Ä¶"
80,Meat & Greek, 3 stars ,2 months ago,Gyros is good . But is not Greek souvlaki!
81,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best gyros in town! Super fresh products, very refined balanced plate. Staff are really friendly and welcoming. Chef's favourite turned out to be my favourite as well! Will be back for some more!"
82,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,a year ago,Is this real life? Vegetarian Gyros with a sparkle on it! Wow! This is better than meat. Beyond better! The veggie pita with Tzatziki and feta cheese. So simple and so easy to get wrong. But not here! All of that on spot and in a vegetarian option! Respect!

87,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,New fave! Food prep is quick enough to take to go or the restaurant is beautiful inside for a sit down meal. I tried a meat substitute gyro (plus spicy feta!) and loved every bite.
88,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,the food looked amazing and was really tasty and I am already planning a visit back. ‚Ä¶
89,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best gyros I've ever had! The meat is fresh, well seasoned and delicious! I had the Chef's favorite and the fig jam was a great touch. High regards for the family recipe!"
90,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice authentic place with vegan option and great service. They do fairly unusual dish in the Netherlands: pork kebab and also vegan kebab with lovely house sauces and pickles and salads. The staff were really nice and spoke good English. ‚Ä¶
91,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"As any student would be, I was tight on a budget on my first trip to Amsterdam.

92,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The Gyros was excellent! You are able to stack your own. They alsl got a lot of nice toppings. Extraordinarily friendly staff and good prices. We even got a free dessert wich was also very delicious. The coffee was good and they complied ‚Ä¶
93,Meat & Greek, 1 star ,a year ago,"Order food from here via UBER, selected ""beef and lamp"" to find out that at home in the receipt it says ""sausage (beef and lamp)"". Come here to see the pictures and see no sausages, only nice beef and lamp... Nice trick Meat & Greek! This time only!"
94,Meat & Greek, 1 star ,a year ago,It seems like a cute small bistro from the outside so we decided to give it a try this weekend. We Were told to wait 2mins to be seated. After about 20 mins we went to ask again. By that time we were told they have no more dishes to be served so we had to leave.
95,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This little spot serves some spectacular Greek food that can be easily consumed walking around should they be too busy for you to grab a seat. Being a popular place for lunch it can get rather busy and the bustle does diminish the ‚Ä¶
96,Meat & Greek, 2 stars ,a year ago,Be aware that this place sells Gyros without fries. So the gyros had a lot of something that tasted like yogurt instead. I‚Äôve been to Greece and I know how good Gyros tastes like so having it without fries was disappointing for me.
97,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Easy to order for take-out or dine-in. Great portion for the price (expect to pay around 9-10 EUR, additional toppings extra). Accepts major credit cards except Amex. I ordered the pork gyro with tzatziki sauce, along with a can of Coke for ‚Ä¶"

99,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food was delicious and we didn‚Äôt want our gyro too sweet so they accommodated our needs and it was as delicious as expected. The staff and the chef were EXTREMELY friendly and helpful and always smiling which was amazing. One of us ‚Ä¶

103,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Awesome! That Vegan Chicken‚Ä¶ Delicious ü§§
104,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very friendly staff. Good service.  Small. Yummy vegetarian options with the tzaziki. The ones without were A bit dry and Not as tasty. If a strong smell of meat cooking bothers you This may not be a pleasant spot to eat. The kitchen is open and directly in the small seated area. Very few tables so it fills up fast.
105,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Not traditional Greek but good. A bit steep on price. Guys cooking very friendly and polite and welcoming. Cashier could learn from them? A smile goes a long way.

111,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really loved this place (new location in Haarlemmerstraat, sort of near Centraal Station).  Will come back!  Great Greek food.  In a touristy neighborhood but worth dealing with the throbbing masses to reach this tasty gem.  I agree with ‚Ä¶"
112,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cute little place with yummy food! I absolutely love the fact that you can have the vegetarian option here that is just as, if not even more, tasty. The staff are also really friendly. It's been my go to place for almost two years!"

117,Meat & Greek, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Place smells extremely of boar taint... Not really Greek, cheap ingredi√´nts and weird uncreative combinations. Doesn't taste bad, but there are better places to spend 10 euro. ‚Ä¶"
118,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went today and ordered the Make-your-own gyro.

Went with tzatziki sauce and it's pretty good! Pork filling is nice and good ‚Ä¶"

120,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I'm not too big on meat (especially pork) but this was a great treat. The thing is, usually pork has so many chunks of fat that I can barely eat it but not @ Meat & Greek tho! ‚Ä¶"
121,Meat & Greek, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"To be clear: This is not a Greek place, but a Dutch Greek place. They do not have lamb and chicken gyros ‚Äî the staple dishes in a Greek restaurant. They have their own invented pork gyros and fake chicken (vegetarian) soja gyros. We tried ‚Ä¶"

123,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"To echo other reviews, the best Gyros in Amsterdam. Great place, fresh food. Highly recommend."
124,Meat & Greek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"After reading the reviews, I ended up somewhat disappointed. The food is fine, no argument here, but nothing special and quite expensive. The decor is different to many other greek restaurants in not being tacky, but rather sterile. Staff was very nice though."
125,Meat & Greek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food but like I always say, overpriced. 7.50‚Ç¨ for a pita bread is fine but if course fine print says includes 1 ingredient. That's pretty miserable. Even more miserable is the fact that each extra topping is an insulting 1.20‚Ç¨ ‚Ä¶"
126,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Yeah pretty good. I decided to pump my own giros and it wasn't bad. The pork was quite well seasoned to could've done with more tomato and cucumber to neutralise saltiness, but it was still pretty good."

128,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent place, nice atmosphere and great food!
Located in one of the most beautiful street of Amsterdam!
Definitely worth a stop for a tasty pita :)"
129,Meat & Greek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Good food but a bit expensive. I visited Meat & Greek on Saturday 9th March 2019 together with 3 friends and we had the classic gyros pitas. I found 10euros for a pita  quite expensive but tasty as well!

132,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very nice food and very friendly staff. Very good prices!
133,Meat & Greek, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Stay away. It's a scam, crazy expensive, fake ""Greek"" place. 25 euros for 3 sandwich mostly lettuce and fade parts of meat. If they tell you it's all about quality... They lie. For 20gr of meat you are better with any classic donner house that charges you for what you eat and not the fantasy you are in Greece... Unfortunately..."
134,Meat & Greek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty gyros with above average prices. Staff very friendly.

3 stars since my friend had the gyro with an egg and next day was not feeling well. I was OK so maybe egg was not good?"

Tastes awesome and the personal is very friendly and polite.
I would recommend this small restaurant to everyone who is going to visit Amsterdam."
139,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very impressed with the quality of the pita bread and the vegetarian option. I have had some weird ""chicken"" before, but this no-meat meat was excellent. The meat eaters with whom I died were also pleased by the animal-based platters."

143,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,GREAT Greek food!!! The best I've ever had in Amsterdam. Most dishes contain meat but there are options for vegetarians. Staff helpful
144,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Great Gyros but no chicken option or potatoes available:/
145,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely amazing food. Haven‚Äôt seen quality like this since I was in Greece. Definitely check it out! The Gyros is absolutely amazing! (Finally there‚Äôs a place here that don‚Äôt make it like its Kebap)
146,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A true hidden gem of Amsterdam, It's quite hard to find good quality affordable food in the city center. This cosy place proved to be an exception, with really friendly staff always willing to help, fresh products and stylish decor."
147,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Location - Centrally located, waking distance from Rembrandtplein. It's a small shop and they have two chairs over looking the street which are the best seat in the restaurant. ‚Ä¶"
148,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good pitas.  Nice people, very helpful, and good service.  The price is a bit high compared to other limited menu restaurants in the area and most extra toppings cost a bit more than expected, but overall it's good quality vs price."
149,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"While it differs from the traditional pittas you will find in Greece, they are delicious and a fresh take at this famous Greek food! Their pitta bread is amazing!"
150,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome place for great Greek food. The pita wrap was filling and delicious filled with lots of pork and creamy feta. Can‚Äôt go wrong by stopping in here
151,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Always very nice , the chutney on the feta on the Chef always adds to it. I can never help but going for the plate, even though I know it's going to be too much, it's too good !"
152,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Not quite Greek and limited choices but good to try
153,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Was really good, my first time in Amsterdam and the first place I went to eat, made my day really, got some greek yogurt and honey at the end which is my favourite, many thanks to the staff, they're brilliant!"
154,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Gigantic gyros, delicious and great price value!"
155,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is a nice local Greek place that mostly sells pita's with delicious meat for an affordable price. They also make salads but they are not very often. When I get out of school early I always go there and get it to go. I guess the only thing that isn't so good is  that they do to go very very slow and mess up orders some times.
156,Meat & Greek, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Loud, stressful environment watching the staff finish to-go orders. Food took forever to come out. If I would have ordered to-go it might have come out sooner. They definitely prioritize those orders over the people dining in the restaurant."
157,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Yes yes very nice pita gyros. I asked for a separate tzakiki. Which I would dip the perfect amount per bite myself. Oh lala delicious! Good for a quick snack.
158,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing gyros. Portions are generous so you better walk in hungry. Staff is nice. I would recommend avoiding lunch times as it might get very busy.
159,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,a month ago,OMG. Best pita ever. Ever.
160,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,a year ago,Fresh and delish. Lovely staff!
161,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice people, very fresh, and very tasty vegetarian options that are basically indistinguishable from meat (first time we ordered we had to compare it to actual meat to be convinced they hadn‚Äôt made a mistake). Excellent coffee too."
162,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice atmosphere with incredibly friendly and helpful staff! The food was so tasty and delicious, would definitely recommend coming here!
(Also, the bathroom was clean and well kept üòä)"

164,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really good gyros.  The classic with pork is delicious. Small place but totally worth eating here or ordering for take out. Highly recommend.
165,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Super tasty pita's with a vegetarian option which comes super close to the real deal! Not to forget the more than friendly staff who even let us try the meat and their spicy feta cheese which is delicious as well.
166,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,You MUST visit this place if you like greek food and you are in Amsterdam. Forget all the other places that pass as greek. This place is the real deal. The only downside is that it's almost always packed and have to wait to find an empty table.
167,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wanted a reasonable price meal and this hit the spot. Fast food but delicious. Homemade pitta bread and choose your filling. Good for meat lovers and vegetarians.

171,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing pita's! Really delicious, many special choices from the menu, or just build your one as you like! Not cheap, but worth, you'll be super full :D"
172,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Awesome food and super friendly staff, which always makes the experience much better.
The space inside is small though!"
173,Meat & Greek, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice looking place with good gyros but very, very expensive. Also I was treated rudely by one of the staff who seemed to be having a bad day (bearded short Greek guy)."
174,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best gyros in Amsterdam. Perfect comfort food. Never fails to deliver the same quality.
175,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fast service, friendly, international vibe. Food is amazing and a Greek colleghe certified that it is one of the best in Amsterdam. Price are low for an average dinner in the city center"
176,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Consumed both in-house and delivered to me at home I always make sure to recommend this place to friends and family. The food never fails to please me and the staff are a great bunch, worth a try (more than once)!"

181,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great and cheap.

186,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best Gyros I've ever had in a city full of great food.  The owners are incredibly friendly and helpful. Definitely recommended!
187,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Still sitting in the restaurant and I just had to do this before I left! I had no idea looking at the menu, so I went off a staff recommendation and it was beyond great food - I'll never be able to look at another pita the same way again. What a find!"

191,Meat & Greek, 1 star ,a year ago,"Wow! Dry and burnt meat! 21 euros for dry sausage and pork, Salty like hell! Avoid it"
192,Meat & Greek, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Mean is mediocre, service is mediocre and in general the concept has nothing to do with Greek Street food. Less than an OK place to eat."
193,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent in every way. Great food and great service. Went there with five friends, and they did everything to make us feel great. Congratulations to Mano and company."
194,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice gyros meat and friendly staff. Seems a bit expensive at first glance but it's quality meat and big portion which make it less expensive and close to other prices
195,Meat & Greek, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Staff are friendly but gyros is absolutely terrible. If you order pita gyros you get a pita salads with trails of gyros. When you eat this meat you'd be glad there is so few pieces of meat. This gyros is a untasty and dry one.
196,Meat & Greek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place for a quick lunch or snack. Possibility to eat in the restaurant or have a take-away. Excellent gyros'.
197,Meat & Greek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My favorite greek place. The sausage pita is amazing. Don't forget to try their homemade sauce.
