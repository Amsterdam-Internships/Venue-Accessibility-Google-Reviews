my to go place for take away pizza, delivery is also free which is nice."
1,Pizzeria San Marco, 3 stars ,a year ago,Well the pizza is very ‚Äúnormal‚Äù I think You come there more for experience to grab pizza from boat rather than actually for mind blowing pizza. So recommend for experience and social part because it can be quite busy so You can talk/meet ‚Ä¶
