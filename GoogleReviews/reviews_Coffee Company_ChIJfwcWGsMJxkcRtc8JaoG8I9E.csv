0,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great coffee house (the not weed kind) with local roasts and excellent espresso drinks and a healthy supplement of finger foods to keep you going. The shop has a good selection of magazines and stable wifi of you need to burn some time. Has restroom and takes card.
1,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We just walked in along our wanderings and found a pleasant relaxed cafe with free WiFi and clean toilets. Lovely homemade lemonade. Great coffee. Unfortunately no food, only cakes. We were lucky to enjoy an art exhibition in the cafe as well."
2,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice atmosphere and great coffee. Perfect place to work or study or just chill away from the madness of the streets.
3,Coffee Company, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,"You gotta be lucky to find a place, where you can sit. Otherwise, ok"
4,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Vegan Dhal Toastie doesn't look like much, bit it sure hits the spot and is at a good price. Coffee is eh (kinda weak, drip coffee) but I don't hold it against them. Cute place to either check emails or plan your day, lots of local youngsters studying / working or hanging out here."
5,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice coffee shop! Really good coffee and great sandwiches. Also the staff was always very friendly. The location is quite hip and very clean. There are also some seats outside in front of the shop.
6,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"In amsterdam, many Cafe and shops don't open early in the morning(even around 10).  But I went here because the place I wanted to go did not open until 12. So I went here instead but I was very satisfied with coffee and carrot pound cake."
7,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Not sure about the coffee quality (I'm not a coffee expert). But the coffee drinks are pretty good👌🏻
8,Coffee Company, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Coffee was good, for the desserts it’s limited options"
9,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Fastest Wi-Fi in ninestreets/Jordan (I've worked most of them), narrow space but always a spare chair. Then the usual magazine selection and moderate design that makes Coffee Company the safest bet wherever you are in Amsterdam."
10,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good spot for a quick coffee on the go. Tried to get food but they had run out already.
11,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,a year ago,Small place to enjoy a good coffee while people watching on the busy little street
12,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Nice 👍🏻
13,Coffee Company, 1 star ,a year ago,"I’m giving them a one star for service.

I understand it’s covid times but being friendly should be a given especially if …"
14,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Welcoming staff, good coffee, central location."
15,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place and helpful waiters. They have a variety of coffee products that you'd also expect in typical American coffee places, such as Starbucks. They have a back area where you can consume your beverage and in warmer weather there is room outside for a few tables and seats. The place has a clean yet somewhat cozy feel to it."
16,Coffee Company, 1 star ,5 months ago,"I used to visit this coffee ,but the girl that work there she treat her customer bad !!"
17,Coffee Company, 1 star ,a year ago,Awfully bad. Long waiting time although we were the only customers. Prepared the coffee for drinking in even when we ordered to go and than only poured the coffee into the to go cup. Almond milk cappuccino did not taste at all like decomposed
18,Coffee Company, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good coffee with relatively friendly staff. The only problem I have with this location is cleanliness. The large table has big gaps in between the boards that are full of crumbs and garbage. Not a pleasant drinking experience. Would come here again for a coffee to go, but not to sit down."
19,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely spot for a cup of coffee. Very clean, open, fresh interior. Great service and good pastries. They even had a couple vegan pastry options. Visited a couple times during our stay in Amsterdam"
20,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Everywhere you go in Amsterdam, you're going to find great coffee, but on my week long trip, I can say that the best espresso drinks were here at coffee company. The decor is nice, they have a few power outlets for laptops.
If you haven't had one before, try a Cortado."
21,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My favourite place to go for a coffee. They have various milk options (I always have oat) and the staff are always friendly. They generally have a super chill vibe too. (The one in the Nine Streets does take card payment by the way)
22,Coffee Company, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice cafe but Chai latte was WAY sweet, and only after I ordered it and tried t did they tell me there’s extra sugar in the mix. Also the lemon poppyseed cake was very stale, probably from the day before. Not worth it."
23,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Way better than any American chain cafe. Good nondairy milk options and a vegan pastry on the menu. Laptop-friendly and quiet enough for a Skype call. Be advised, the wifi password changes daily."
24,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Amsterdam’s version of Starbucks.  Always a reliable cup of coffee.  Drinks are ‘crafted’ to order so if there’s more then 3 people in line in front of you, expect to wait 10 minutes for a drink."
25,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great atmosphere for coffee. Good wifi connection. Chilling place for tourist for a rest. Friendly staff. The only thing I would comment is the coffee has been overpriced. Otherwise everything is perfect.
26,Coffee Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very cozy atmosphere and great coffee! The service was great and you can definitely capture some Instagram worthy shots here :> i definitely suggest this place if you're looking to have a nice cup of coffee.

30,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Friendly staff and great choice of coffees, teas and nice juices. The chai with almond milk was lovely. I like the big wooden communal table."
31,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Seek them out for a good, decent coffee with all the regular pastries."
32,Coffee Company, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Crowded, noisy, cramped space, average coffee at above average prices. Sadly there are little other options in Amsterdam city center."
33,Coffee Company, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The coffee is nice, and they're quick to make it, so it perfect for when you're in a hurry and want a take away drink. I wish they had more snacks or sandwiches."
34,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Decent place for coffee in the center of Amsterdam. Free wifi. But pastries, baked goods, sandwiches are of average quality."
35,Coffee Company, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Good coffee and a nice place to work with your laptop or read a book. The staff is friendly and the cafe is in a very nice neighbourhood. The coffee is a bit overpriced.
