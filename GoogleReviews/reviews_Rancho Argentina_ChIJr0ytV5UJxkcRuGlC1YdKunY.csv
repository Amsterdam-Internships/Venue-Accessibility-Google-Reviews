0,Rancho Argentina, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Pretty good Argentinian grill. The empanada was ok... the steak was excellent. The Argentinian wine was a bit over priced for the winery, but understand since they have to import it. I use that wine for a cheap sangria. ‚Ä¶"

5,Rancho Argentina, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fine restaurant with great friendliness and good manners. The meat is fine and the sauces  are really decent. There can be some improvement on the fries, rice  or potatoes. The service is actually great and not leaning on ‚Äúwe‚Äùll probably mot see you again‚Äù policy! First #ranchos and then the movies"
6,Rancho Argentina, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very very good üçñ and very friendly stuff. The prices good for that quality of food. I visited two times and I hope to visited again.
7,Rancho Argentina, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Served on a tablegrill is a nice touch. Since not all pieces are kept warm, well, they cool off pretty fast. Its for 2 persons. Fries, salad and sauces.

18,Rancho Argentina, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Good prices and good meal! Was very much happy with the meat and service
19,Rancho Argentina, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The steaks are dry (even the medium rare) and they taste like a big lump of black pepper. It takes ages for them to bring the food and the price is really not worth it. There are far far better steaks in other places in that area.

22,Rancho Argentina, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Good steaks but bad service. There was still blood on the plate and when I ordered a tonic I got a bitter lemon. My food was first delivered to the people next to us. Salad only contains lettuce. Bill was wrongly written and  was 95.99 Euro.

27,Rancho Argentina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This is a place that we have used before, but today the staff were arrogant and rude, they overcharged for something we did not order. This is the last time we ever go to this place. There are many good steak houses in Amsterdam but this is not one of them."

29,Rancho Argentina, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was good.  Service was pretty bad.  When the bill came, the waiter insisted that the 'service is not included' when I knew that it was.  I called him out on it, and showed him the line on the bill, he said 'Oh thats just taxes'.  Total tourist trap.  If the food hadn't been decent it would have been one star."
30,Rancho Argentina, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Visited here for a second time on my second trip to Amsterdam. Amazing steak, good wine, plenty of chips and salad. 2 for 49E is great value and quality."
31,Rancho Argentina, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Found the fries very good, burger was oke.   now am i not going to amsterdam a lot . but in my opinion is 15 euro for normal a burger. a bit to expensive"
32,Rancho Argentina, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very rude service. When you kindly ask for something; the lady who works here just yells at you and shuts her colleagues down.
