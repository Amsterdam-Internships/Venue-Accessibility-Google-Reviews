1,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 1 star ,5 months ago,"I live in Amsterdam and had not been to this place in a while. I went there to enjoy a drink with my wife and two kids on a Sunday afternoon. The place was busy, but with a large number of waiters present service should have been much …"

4,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"A friendly place with a terrace along the canal. Two special dishes are highly recommend: the cheese fondue and the mussels. Different but both very good. The portion is bigger than usual and the ""soupe"" that is left after eating the mussels is fantastic. Small selection of wines but enough variety to suit all tastes."
5,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If I could give them more stars I would! Place is incredible, really nice and typical despite being not full of tourists. Staff and waiters are the nicest and most professional ever. We have been treated so well. Fondue is of course to try …"
6,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 1 star ,4 months ago,Pretty terrible experience here today. We had visitors staying who fancied stopping for a beer and a snack en route home on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The waiter was rude as we sat down and then proceeded to serve nothing and nobody for 20minutes. Eventually we gave up and went round the corner to somewhere more welcoming.
7,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place, great place for coffee, beer and brunch. The customer service par excellence. veggie burger Apple pie with special liquor - and the friendly crew to serve the customers. A word of appreciation to them Must visit in Amsterdam"

10,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very cool place to have a drink and some food, with a good view of one of the canals. There are lots of different beers and gin to try and the staff were very helpful with their recommendations. The snack tasting plate was amazing, the wild boar croquettes were fantastic, as was the liverwurst."
11,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a restaurant, not a destillery. As long as you are clear on that you will be fine off. Attentive service and friendly staff together with great jenever and gin asortement. Also with decent food, but that is not the reason to go here."

13,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The interior of this location is really nice and invites on the first view. The range of genever is outstanding. Additional, the sandwiches are very tasty so you don't have to switch locations to eat. I can recommend this place!"
14,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely amazing! We had the small platter and cheese fondue, along with two Heinekens.  Friendly service with a great view of the canal.  Would recommend!"

22,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A great little find just on the Herengracht. With heaters outside and a cosy interior, the staff were extremely friendly. The food was superb, and as it was a little late as the chef was on his own, they offered us free drinks as an …"

26,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Quite warm- nice place.
27,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 1 star ,4 months ago,Pretty place and nice food but terrible service.
28,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,a year ago,Really nice place! Waiters were really nice! We thought it would be a very touristic place that often don’t seem very authentic but not at all! A plus for the Fondue
29,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very lovely place, decent prices for beer given the location and very friendly bar staff. Extra points for the patio heaters giving you a view over prinsengracht, but points deducted for slow outdoor service. Will be coming back for re-evaluation soon!"
30,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 1 star ,2 years ago,Maybe we were unlucky but we experienced very very bad service. Waiter forgot orders and simply didn't want to do his job. Food is ok but nothing extraordinary. I had cheese fondue and it wasn't that special. Cute location. Toilets were messy and damaged
31,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best apple pie in Amsterdam. We had a nice dinner here. The staff was friendly. The apple pie was amazing. It was served with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, a chocolate with liquor inside, and a small shot of cinnamon liquor. We tried to go back the next day but they had a staff retreat. Really, try the apple pie."

34,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really charming location and decent price for beers. We ordered a snack platter but after waiting 30 mins we had to leave and the platter was nowhere to be seen. Also slow service to get the beers. They also served food (which smelled good but we were only there for drinks)
35,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very nice place, great mood, nice waiters. The meat could be better though. My main issue is that I was sick the entire night after eating at there. Maybe it was just bad luck, to be noted though."
36,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,If you want a genever experience (apparently pre dates gin ) you can get a flight of them with old cheese and cured meat.   Then order some food (mixed appetizer).  Wonderful experience.   Servers knew what they were talking about. Loved it!!!  We are Canadians  celebrating Canada day in Amsterdam.   Perfect evening.
37,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 1 star ,3 years ago,We don't recommend this place to anybody. It seems that the waiters here do not like to help clients. The staff left empty tables dirty for a long time and helped newer customers earlier than us. We asked them twice for help they did not …

41,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice cozy place to have drinks and meal. The steak was amazing, the bread & herb butter a must plus a visit from one of the restaurant cats that napped by my side made my evening."
42,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"Nice for drinks but over priced food, small portions, not worth the trip."
43,A. van Wees Proeflokaal, 1 star ,3 years ago,TOURISTS DO NOT GO HERE. WAITERS WILL TRY TO STEAL FROM YOU. The man with the dark black hair tried to steal 10 euros from me. When I pointed out that the change was wrong he rolled his eyes at me and gave me dirty looks on his way to take …
