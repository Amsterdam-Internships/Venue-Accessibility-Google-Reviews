0,Eagle, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A  great venue to spend your time. Because of a very cosy space thanks to the layout with three floors, with the bar centered on door-level, nicely designed. There is even a wall full covered with mirror. The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxed. There is a nice staff too!!!"
1,Eagle, 1 star ,2 years ago,I perhaps did not see the best of this place. I went on Saturday of Pride. It was rammed and felt dangerous. The stairs are typical of Amsterdam but the crowds and the lights made them dangerous. The toilets were disgusting- overflowing â€¦
2,Eagle, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had a great time here during our first visit to Amsterdam. My husband and I went here and met a number of locals and tourists  a number of the locals were welcoming and entertaining. Quite a lot of good looking men. The bartender Poe (spelling) made us feel very welcomed.  Would definitely visit Eagle Amsterdam again.
3,Eagle, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the worst place I went in this vacation. I saw many nice things on Twitter about this place but on Friday night is really boring. Compared to similar place is small, even compared to similar cruise ber in Italy (where we are not so â€¦"
4,Eagle, 1 star ,2 years ago,"My iphone was stolen here today (3rd-Nov-19) and I realised that in less than 10 minutes after loosing my phone. I immediately contacted the bar tender and explained my situation and asked for a phone to contact the police, he said he â€¦"
5,Eagle, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice bar, sexy bartenders...but BEWARE of pick pockets down in the dark room areas. Have been picked 3x over the years at this particular bar.  They are VERY savvy and good at what they do!"
6,Eagle, 1 star ,4 years ago,"It's my first time ever to feel discriminated by a gay bartender Ina gay bar. I was siting just behind the bar and all of a sudden the bartender and while he was talking to another customer, he was pointing at me and waving his both hands â€¦"
7,Eagle, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly staff (thank you Paul for taking care of me when I was drunk), relaxed atmosphere, good music. I love sundays vibes!!!!
New lights and sound is GREAT! I know, sometimes there can be less guys but this â€¦"
8,Eagle, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"During the Amsterdam Pride we've visited ""The Eagle"". The barkeepers and the music are great! But the toilets are terrible! everywhere piss - not only in the toilets (in front of the toilets and on the floor) and thus it smells!"
9,Eagle, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I checked in my jacket AND my backpack with the coat check and had 6 individual bags with a gram of marijuana, in each missing.  The only one remaining is hash.  I will be back to confront the man who checked my belongings, other than that, this place was not impressive."
10,Eagle, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Thanks so much for hosting the Meantime party. Very friendly! It was fun for my wife to see the inside and enjoy your interesting ""facilities"" herself!"
11,Eagle, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Never been to a place for a Â«Â after partyÂ Â» where they do not  refresh the staff , nor clean the toilets ( piles of toilet paper) and all people working in the bar are exhausted after a night shift and the coat check does not even know how to smile or communicate properly .. SAD!!"
12,Eagle, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of my favorite places to go when in Amsterdam and my favorite Eagle I have been to. Found everyone friendly and a lot of hot men! Many memories formed here and will definitely be back again
13,Eagle, 1 star ,5 years ago,Not a unique bar. Not crowded at all. Maybe when more people are there it is better. I don't know why some bars have such bad staff but this is one with very nasty rude staff.  Be warned.
14,Eagle, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Service was not so nice. Drink pours are not generous. Good music though ðŸ¤” so I guess Iâ€™ll do 3 stars. Wish I could have put more.
15,Eagle, 1 star ,4 years ago,Was robbed in the dark room by a professional jewelry thief. When I was at the police station another guy had his wallet stolen there. Very dangerous with money and jewelry so be aware! I wasn't.
16,Eagle, 1 star ,2 years ago,Could not believe the hate and how cruel they were to a trans person at this location. They were so mean and kicked a trans person out whilst saying very hateful discriminating things to them. Very hateful people! Do not support this establishment!!!
17,Eagle, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The days of heavy sex in Amsterdam are over. The place is becoming straight laced & ultra-conservative. Calfornia is currently the new up&coming Amsterdam, with has shops opening all over. All regulated and safer than the prelegal days. A straight sensible opinion on drugs."

19,Eagle, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great atmosphere, dark rooms, sling and even a douching station. The music is good and the service is ok, I think I was banned though, who knows why"
20,Eagle, 1 star ,3 years ago,"You can simply charge an entrance instead of shouting to each customer for mandatory drink! Bad Vibe, avoid this bar"

63,Eagle, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) We visited the bar on a Sunday in mid-August between 0: 00-1: 00, unfortunately it was so little going on that we left the bar after about 1 hour. The waiter was very friendly and couldn't really fault it. Drink â€¦"
64,Eagle, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) It seems like a fun place. It's not very big but it has a dance floor and a dark room on the floor below. The waiters are great, it's worth entering just to see them. I was a little special day because there was a â€¦"
