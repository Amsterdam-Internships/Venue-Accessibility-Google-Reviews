0,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice enough bistro in a lovely location in Amsterdam. The interior of the restaurant is very tasteful and intimate. The food is also nice and as described. Would have expected slightly higher quality of the meat from the tartare, but was still tasty. Wine selection is good!"
1,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 3 stars ,a week ago,"Got there in time for our reservation, but we had to wait ten minutes by the door for our table to be cleaned.
The place was very full, so the staff was overwhelmed and couldn't keep up with ‚Ä¶"
2,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"We stopped at Bleu for a quick coffee and glass of beer.
However, the place, the atmosphere, the waiter and Jason, the manager made us feel so welcome and they were so nice and friendly that we stayed for dinner. ‚Ä¶"
3,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Nice cosy bistro in Jordaan. Good value for money and good food. Can do better on the service! Realise there is a restaurant staff shortage so can‚Äôt blame them.
4,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Cosy place with reasonable prices for rather big portions. Lobster and French fish (seafood) soup were very good üòã
5,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice place for dating. The main dish is amazing, especially the catch of the day. While not recommend the starters. It‚Äôs too salute for us."
6,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,7 months ago,We stopped by for dessert and a drink and it was super. The dessert was great and the service was perfect. Thanks !
7,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very cozy restaurant with a nice french menu. The staff is friendly and the service was quite fast. Perfect for two persons but also suitable for groups. The average price varies from ‚Ç¨25-35 per person. ‚Ä¶
8,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A cute French cozy place with good food and service.  I had the fresh catch of the day and so appreciated that salt and pepper were put  on the side for people who watch their sodium intake.  We enjoyed a friendly Dutch couple sitting next to us and we had a great evening chatting with them.
9,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,4 months ago,The staff isn't friendly. Only one of the waiters was friendly to us. The food was tasty but nothing special. And price of the set 3-course menu ended up being more expensive than to order the exact same choices a la carte.
10,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 1 star ,5 months ago,"We got table at the back where there was no nice atmosphere when sitting next to a damaged wallpaper. Had to ask for a cutlery for the snails which wasn't brought with the dish. The steak was cold and raw, not rare, but raw. And we ordered ‚Ä¶"
11,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Really tasteful food for an excellent price and such a cosy place to get a romantic dinner for two. All the dishes, cocktails and desserts were just simply amazing and the staff was very helpful and kind. Definitely would visit this place again"
12,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We found this place on Maps by searching for nearby restaurants during my 1 week stay in Amsterdam and it was the best choice. It's one of the best places in town, close to the Central Station. The food is amazing and the staff is very nice! We loved the mushroom starter and chocolate crumble dessert. We had dinner twice here :)8"
13,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Unfortunately at bad visit. The starters were nice, but the ‚ÄúTo share dish‚Äù was many steps better then a one man dish.
It took quite the time to get service and we were thinking about leaving but ‚Ä¶"
14,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I really like this place! Very cute restaurant. The stairs are pretty. Comfortable seating and tables seem to have a nice amount of space between them.
Great service. We accidentally made a reservation for the wrong night but ‚Ä¶"
15,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went here on a whim, and they got us in immediately. Cosy, chill atmosphere, bordering on fancy...but not overdoing it. Solid burger and my girlfriend enjoyed whatever the attached picture is."
16,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Went here 5 years ago but just remembered their carrot soup‚Ä¶still drooling. I felt like I have never truly had soup before. Loved it for dinner on a cold day!
17,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 2 stars ,3 years ago,All in all I expected a lot better from this restaurant. There are other restaurants in the area that don't have these con's. ‚Ä¶
18,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Combination of mediocre service and sub par food.

We made reservations for 8:30pm. I arrived 15 minutes early and waited at the ‚Ä¶"
19,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We showed up close to closing and were seated immediately. Had a wonderful meal of foie gras, Cornish game hen and the burger for mains. Dame Blanche for dessert and a carafe of the house Malbec. Lingered for a while. One of the better meals we‚Äôve had in the Netherlands."
20,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Very disrespectful service. Although the food was good they were disorganized and kaotic. The waiters were super rude and even mean at the end, not accepting any suggestions and turning back. Very impolite. I would not recommend this place at all."
21,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious meal. A great little spot to have a cocktail and a bite to eat. We really enjoyed it. Stumbled upon this place during gay pride and made sure to visit again when we were back in Amsterdam.
22,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food was super! Especially salmon and lobster...you should try them for sure.And the service you can receive is wonderful. Especially the one who served us with French was so charming and helpful. Love this place so much and I'll definitely be back when come back.
23,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"For lunch: very overpriced for simple/small dishes, unfriendly staff, very touristy. Wouldn't go there again. Honestly bit of a waste of money/lunch."
24,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really really liked it! Recommend their bites-croquets and bitterballen-super DELICIOUS!
Good drinks and spacious sitting area. Nachoes were a massive quanity and very salty but freshly made."
25,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Slow service‚Ä¶ from sit down to ask it took us twenty minutes to get a drink order. Small portions; I ordered the chicken and it was very dry. Overall, bad service, very inexperienced staff, and not great food. For the price, I would go elsewhere to get the service and food expected."
26,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is good, but nothing extraordinary given the price. Service is polite, but a bit slow. Nice atmosphere. For dinner reserve a table in advance."
27,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great French place with a special oven. Nice and friendly staff. Please make sure you book on weekends to avoid disappointment

29,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,a month ago,Really nice lunch....croque monsieur and white wine. Lovely staff.
30,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Huge portions for a decent price. I ordered the mussels and it came American-sized with a side of fries and salad. Probably should have skipped the soup, but it was also very food. Small and intimate. Wish I had room for dessert! I also love any European place that offers tap water."
31,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,4 days ago,"Beef steak and carpaccios was very good.
Same for sides and deserts too"
32,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"good and friendly service, very tasty food.
if you order burger, you need to add fries as a supplement."
33,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Partner read somewhere that it's the ""best lunch spot in town"" and I couldn't agree more. The quality of the food and the value for money is crazy. The service is also great, as we were initially going to move on to elsewhere until a wonderful doorman enticed us with samples of the soup of the day. A must have for lunch!"
34,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place exceeds expectations. We showed up last min on New Years Eve with no reservation and they took us in as if we were friends and family - thank you to Ragna for squeezing us in! The service was amazing, even when the restaurant was ‚Ä¶"

37,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"We ordered an entree with mushrooms and cream and melted cheese on top. The dish was cold in the center, theh clearly just popped it in the microwave and reheat it. I tpld them and they changed it.
The food is a bit expensive for what it is."
38,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"The place is cozy, the staff are friendly, the food is nice but nothing special, it‚Äôs over price on what you get."

40,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,a year ago,By far the best food I have tried in Amsterdam. I went with my girlfriend and we had the soup of the day (courgette soup)n the carpaccio and for the main dish the butchers steak. All of the dishes were excellent. And the service was ‚Ä¶

44,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent food. We had a diner coupon for three dishes. Price was totally acceptable for what we got. Restroom was a little stinky (some sewer problem), but I think that temporary, so not really a problem. We visited around December and ‚Ä¶"

57,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very fine dishes, certainly not a turist trap. Great option for a great evening."
58,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 1 star ,4 years ago,Waste of time. It took them more than one hour to prepare the food while there were not many others. They treat you with a fake smile that dies after answering your question.
59,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good seafood, reasonable price, relax atmosphere!"
60,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I'm not understanding all the fuss about this restaurant... Quality is very average and overpriced for what you get.. I had a fish soup and it was ok, but my friend had a lambs chops and they were so raw he could not even finish them, plus ‚Ä¶"
61,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Reviews aren't everything. Take every review with a grain of salt as experiences differ based on preference. Supposedly this restaurant's seating is based on reservations. Had no clue, so when me and a buddy stopped by, we got lucky to get ‚Ä¶"
62,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Heard of this gem of a spot from a friend. Hands down one of the best places I've been to in awhile. My sirloin with a red wine sauce was phenomenal. Extra fries after toie first serving are also a plus. Great atmosphere, great food, great staff who were super helpful."
63,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 1 star ,2 years ago,The wine container they used is broken we were kinda scared when we discovered it and hoped there is no broken glass in the wine.
64,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Many times I passed this restaurant while riding my bicycle in the Jordaan, it always looked so cosy and inviting. I remember stopping by for a coffee and sitting outside on more than one occasion. Today I had the opportunity to sample ‚Ä¶"
65,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We went there as part of the Restaurant Week and all three dishes were delicious in unexpected ways. All the staff is really nice and helpful as well. Our only issue was getting up and going home because we were both so full.

67,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The staff was very friendly and our order was picked up quickly. The burger and meat was great and the dishes (salad and fries) also excellent. The dishes can be ordered as many times as you like.
68,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great find. We just happened to be in the area and read a couple nice reviews and decided to check Bleu out. Boy are we glad we did. The food was excellent and the service outstanding. As luck would have it we were seated next to the bar ‚Ä¶
69,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,best meal in town. i like it
70,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Starters were very good. Main dish not exceptional... we were seated at the lower level and the down side about the place was the flies! My partner killed 2 flies during the meal and 1 after. It was annoying, I hope they will solve that ‚Ä¶"
71,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was good. Service was ok - we were told we could have extra fries & salad but when we requested more, they failed to arrive. Other than that, and the $10 bottle of water, a good experience."
72,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good experience and high quality steak. I wasn't impressed by the table recieved initially. Avoid the updtairs area in the back, it is incredibly loud and dark. The friendly staff moved us on request, it was like sitting in a completely ‚Ä¶"
73,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food tasted delicious, there just wasn't enough of it. I'd expected the lamb to come with season vegetables but it was just lamb (which was really nice to be fair) and sauce. The starter and desert were both great!"
74,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My partner and I had a stellar experience. We had reservations at Black, their sister branch, but due to a power outage we couldn't eat there. The staff was very apologetic and friendly. They called us a cab, which they paid for, to take us ‚Ä¶"

77,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 3 stars ,4 years ago,This place was very popular. Jam packed when we arrived and waiting staff seemed to struggle to cope for the first hour or so that we were there. We had waiters coming to us with other tables main dishes before our starters had even arrived ‚Ä¶
78,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The dishes are delicious and the stuff is super friendly and kind.
79,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,a year ago,We ordered the menu de champagne from restaurant bleu for christmas dinner and it was amazing! Can recommend it for everyone who wants a special three course menu !
80,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great menu. Service very very kind and alert. We had a table for 8 on the small terrace in the Prinsenstraat. I tasted the foie gras and for main course the (200gr) steak tartare which was really good. Presentation super (see chocolate crumble). Would recommend it to everyone (even to vegetarians). Value for money more than OK.
81,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very tasty and very friendly staff. However, there could be more space in between the tables to increase the comfort while dining. Love the modern interior and Rituals soap and hand lotion in the bathrooms :)"
82,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Loved it!
83,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Ok food, nothing special, but few quantity and very pricy. I will not come back. It‚Äôs supposed to be a French restaurant I think, so they should make bigger portions and serve some cheese after the main course. Maybe instead of fries (that ‚Ä¶"
84,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was nice...nothing too mind blowing though.
The downstairs seating area had a smell and was cold which took something away from the whole experience.
Staff were very nice and helpful."
85,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Good food, small space"
86,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,a year ago,Bleu is my favourite neighborhood haunt. The service & food are always on point. Special enough for a celebration with friends or casual enough for dinner with your special someone.
87,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food, in a cosy, friendly environment. Good selection of dishes, large wine list served by helpful waiting staff. Will definitely be returning."

94,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was great but the food was just alright. I had a filet cooked medium and it was a bit rubbery and not flavorful, seemed like a frozen steak. I also had a half lobster but, that was good."
95,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very cozy restaurant. It was amongst the best steaks I've had during my European travels. The mushroom starter was also amazing.
96,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly folks and tasty food. Nice break while exploring.
97,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A reasonable place for lunch, but nothing memorable. Waitress should ensure she's wiped down the tables before checking her phone at lunchtime. Can't think of what evils salmon and egg had done, to be drowned so cruelly in an ocean of hollandaise sauce."
98,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great food and service. Enjoyed a hot carrot soup with ginger while waiting for a booking in the Anne Frank's house. The staff were very friendly and the atmosphere was clean and cosy.
99,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice place for a lunch. I got the smoked salmon and egg with hollandaise on bread. The price is fair. The staff is really nice. The place by the window was perfect and comfortable.
100,Bistro-Brasserie Blue, 1 star ,3 years ago,This under-stairs table is a really unpleasant place for eating bcz it is too close to the upstairs‚Äô customer‚Äôs feet... The crab cracker is difficult to use and the lobster is below the expectation. I am Very disappointed for this place. It is a bad choice for me to end the trip in the Amsterdam....

I would say one of the best experience I had in Amsterdam in 2 years.
