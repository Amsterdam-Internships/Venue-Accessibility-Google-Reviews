0,De Taart van m'n tante, 1 star ,3 years ago,"De Taart Van Mâ€™n Tante: Tarts and Cakes in Amsterdam

Located on the corner of a street facing the metro behind Heineken and meters â€¦"
1,De Taart van m'n tante, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"No wine as their menu offers. Only two type of cupcake , 3 pies and 1 cake to choice from. Decor is cute, however need to be replace as they use faux cakes. The deco cake are faded, discolored and a little dusty. Order the carrot cake it was ok but not fresh."
2,De Taart van m'n tante, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very cute/kitsch place in Amsterdam with great cakes and coffees. Do not only trust the menu, take a look in their display and let your heart guide you ;) but beware, it's more expensive than other cafÃ©s (â‚¬5 for a hot chocolate, while it usually costs around â‚¬3)."
3,De Taart van m'n tante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The visit by my daughter and I was amazing. The cakes, got chocolate and service were amazing"
4,De Taart van m'n tante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A very special place. I visted the tart van mijn tante two times this year. The location is colourl with a fancy decoration. We tried the apple tart and the italian lemon tart. Delicious !!!
5,De Taart van m'n tante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love love love this place! Very eclectic and edgy, something you wouldnâ€™t expect from a bakery. The Swedish Princess cake is an absolute must."
6,De Taart van m'n tante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is the nicest cake I've tasted in 20 years of my life. My life has peaked, and I will never taste a better cake. Thank you Cake Shop for opening my eyes and enlightening me. Yours, Toby."
7,De Taart van m'n tante, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Found it very expensive for what it offers. We played 32â‚¬ for three regular cakes and three lattes. The taste is very average to low for being a 'cake' cafe. The coffee was also not good. So if you are a coffee or cake lover, I advise you to stay away from this place and use your money in something better."
8,De Taart van m'n tante, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The pecan pie is absolutely heavenly, however a bit overpriced (I believe we payed 6 or 6.50 per slice and the slices weren't that big). Overall setting is cute with all the pink and tassles. It's nice to have seen and experienced it. â€¦"
9,De Taart van m'n tante, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Hmm... We wanted cake, lots of it but alas we were denied service because there were no customers to keep them open. Ironic."
10,De Taart van m'n tante, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is always popping it seems. Love the look and the decor, the cakes are good too. Come for a treat at tea time and try anything that suits your fancy, everything seems really well made, with love and care. Helpful servers too, will answer all questions and help you make decisions. They are good with kids here as well"
11,De Taart van m'n tante, 1 star ,5 years ago,6 Disorganized servers only serving 11 tables. Our server didn't know what coffees the menu had. Our cake never came. Our tea was wrong and the pot volume was for 2 not 4 people as ordered. Server was kind enough to say he would strike the â€¦
12,De Taart van m'n tante, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful looking ""home made"" Hot Chocolate, but just looking nice and not hot nor feeling  home made at all,  for 5â‚¬, definitely not worthy. Prices are a little bit high, focaccia wasn't nice either, yes to the Pecan Pie. â€¦"
13,De Taart van m'n tante, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Expensive and very slow ineffective service. We waited 15 minutes for 2 cakes and the waitress forgot our tea. We had to specifically ask for 2 cups because she only brought 1. Not coming back again. Cakes are good though.
14,De Taart van m'n tante, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Low quality and expensive. Slow service who agree place is expensive. Temperature of espresso machine is too high so bitter coffee, cake has little taste also not fresh on Sundays. Interior dated could be funky if remainder was ok which is not the case. 0 stars"
15,De Taart van m'n tante, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice cosy cafÃ© and patisserie. Bright decor and friendly staff who look like they enjoy working there. They do some savoury things but mainly it's sweet items. Good for a quick catch up with friends or a somewhere to sit for a while and read.
16,De Taart van m'n tante, 1 star ,6 years ago,Nice interior but (really) horrible service! 5 persons running around having no idea what to do. Waited 30 minutes after ordering for two pieces of cake which was not even worth it's money. Would have better spent the time and made a cake by our own...
17,De Taart van m'n tante, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Build for the typical tourist! A short selection of the menu card? Sure ! Chocolat-Cake => 5.90 â‚¬ .... a chocolat drink... ""handmade""... 5.50 â‚¬.... and a non-existent service.... a waist of money!!!!"
18,De Taart van m'n tante, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Better go to Mc Donalds. Unless you don't care to pay no less than 5 euros for a FROZEN piece of cake!
Are you serious? Overpriced place with bad quality. Please, don't fool to the customers."
19,De Taart van m'n tante, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We ordered a custimized cake for birthday. Staff are nice and approachable. Although it's a little pricy but cake is delicious.
20,De Taart van m'n tante, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Cakes where delicious, but quite expensive nothing under 5 euro per slice... Cake and coffee for 4 persons 50 Euro... That leaves a slightly bitter taste even though the tarts where yummy."
21,De Taart van m'n tante, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Cakes and pie's are ok tho a bit dry in my experience. The coffee was ok
It is quite expensive for what you get.
Staff were friendly tho and the location is great. A nice place to get a coffee."
22,De Taart van m'n tante, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Sunday family tea/cake time. Come and visit this placeplaces
23,De Taart van m'n tante, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Sweet pleasant, friendly place. Cakes and coffee were excellent. Definitely on the call kitschy side but great of its type."
24,De Taart van m'n tante, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Large choice of cakes, i highly recommend the mellow mango. The place is cute, pink and joyful colours everywhere."
25,De Taart van m'n tante, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Definitely on the expensive side but cute and cosy. I had lovely service and cakes are dressed fresh so the small wait was not an inconvenience at all
26,De Taart van m'n tante, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very Nice location and atmosphere. Poor quality of pies though - even though its their only business. For a meet up its nice, to eat good pie.. unfortunately not."
27,De Taart van m'n tante, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Fun aesthetic but the cakes are dry and sickeningly sweet- even my kids couldn't finish a piece, which has never happened. :/"
28,De Taart van m'n tante, 1 star ,2 years ago,A waste of money and time for sure.. I ordered two coffees and two tiny slices of pie and ended up paying +20â‚¬. Definetely look for another place :) â€¦
29,De Taart van m'n tante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The mango cake was absolutely divine!!!
30,De Taart van m'n tante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely cakes and a beautiful ambience... The lady is very friendly and the place looks really pretty!
31,De Taart van m'n tante, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"In fact, there are not so many tarts but more pies. Beautiful cakes, very funny place but little disappointed with the hazelnut pie."
32,De Taart van m'n tante, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Cakes taste just ok, but cost no less than 5 euro per small slice! Ridiculous!"
33,De Taart van m'n tante, 1 star ,4 years ago,they employ people for a test shift without paying them at all. so please dont wonder why the staff is maybe not the happiest or best... not fair!! ðŸ‘Ž
34,De Taart van m'n tante, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Lovely service and the sweets are also well executed. Laid back atmosphere and away from the tourists.
35,De Taart van m'n tante, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The cakes are really good!
The owner is a fantastic person.
Nice people."
36,De Taart van m'n tante, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Way over priced. â‚¬20 for two cakes and 2 drinks!
37,De Taart van m'n tante, 4 stars ,9 years ago,A very special place to celebrate with something sweet.  Be prepared for a heavy cream filled experience.

68,De Taart van m'n tante, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Poor service and immediate payment because you sit outside. Then the cake is nice, but that is canceled out for me if you have to pay 5 euros for half a cup of lukewarm chocolate. This applies to all drinks: â€¦"

74,De Taart van m'n tante, 1 star ,5 years ago,"(Translated by Google) The ""cake"" that we were served was really anything but fresh. As dry as barley and a cardboard bottom. And that for more than 5 euros each, to be ashamed of you. â€¦"
75,De Taart van m'n tante, 2 stars ,3 years ago,(Translated by Google) Far too expensive for what you get offered. Interior looks old and is nothing special. Tasty rather average. Conclusion: then but rather cafe and pastry on the hand. â€¦
