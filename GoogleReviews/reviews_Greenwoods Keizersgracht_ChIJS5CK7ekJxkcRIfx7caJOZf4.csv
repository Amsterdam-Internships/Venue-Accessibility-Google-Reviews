1,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Cozy place that serves probably the best English breakfast in Amsterdam. It is always busy. Usually requires 15 minutes of waiting on a weekend. The staff is super friendly and the food is great.
2,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"One of my favorite places in Amsterdam for English breakfast/brunch/lunch. Its fresh, the waitresses are friendly and funny. It‚Äôs a cozy and little place. The waffle duck and English breakfast are my recommendations (so far I tried)!"
3,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Cozy place with very friendly service. We ordered the veggie and regular English breakfast, which were a more modern version on the original. The soda bread was amazing, but we weren‚Äôt big fans of the hash browns and mushrooms. All the ‚Ä¶"
4,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Gorgeous food, service and views! Food was delicious, and having the luxury of eating breakfast in front of the canal made it better. Be prepared to wait a bit in line, since it‚Äôs a quite popular breakfast and lunch spot. Service was great!"
5,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Out of 5 years visiting Amsterdam I wonder how I missed this beautiful treasure. Without a doubt the tastiest, filling and flavoured breakfast we have ever had here. ‚Ä¶"
6,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Small and cosy cafe! We absolutely enjoyed the food and super pleased with Veronica‚Äôs service, from the moment we waited for a table to the end. She is so sweet, friendly and professional. That was what stood out for me! What a gem."
7,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great place we discovered during our visit in Amsterdam! Pulled Duck on waffle was excellent. The English breakfast was thought out: it wasn't a 'throw bacon from a package, white beans in sauce from a can and other processed things to hit ‚Ä¶"
8,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Cosy place with good atmosphere! The waiter was very nice!
The shakshuka was tasty!
I recommend it!"
9,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Had a Veggie breakfast was oke, the hash browns are amazing though. You get a lot but it's a bit pricey if you consider what ingredients you get on the plate. Service could be better. Even if it's busy a waiter should take time with her costumers and I really misted that here."
10,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great views on the canals and understanding of vegan, gluten free food. I ordered the falafel bowl and I still don't understand how this was gluten free, it tasted amazing! Waitress was kind and provided water for my dog. Prices are ok too, not super expensive for what you get."
11,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Love it here! Keep coming back for their beautiful breakfast which is available all day. Friendly staff and comfy atmosphere.
12,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Still at the restaurant and I couldn‚Äôt wait to rate it! By far the best breakfast restaurant I‚Äôve eaten at across many countries! Great service and ambience too!! Love it!!!

14,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Delicious breakfast, the hash brown are nice and crunchy, the restaurant is downstairs so there isn‚Äôt much light coming in but otherwise it was a delightful breakfast"
15,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We had breakfast here last week and it was amazing! Very cute interior, amazing menu and the food was plenty and tasty. What put the experience over the top though, was the amazing service: even though it was crazy busy, the waiters were on ‚Ä¶"
16,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"the food is good and they prepare it fast. If I do not give the 5 stars it is for the waitress, she made us wait a lot in addition to not speaking well."

18,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Friendly service in this restaurant and great food. Portions are large so you will get value for your money for sure. Went here for lunch. It‚Äôs not a super big place so might be full when you go there, keep that in mind."
19,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Most impressive eggs royale that I've eaten! Popular spot, so recommend booking ahead"
20,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 4 stars ,4 months ago,It‚Äôs a great place to have a proper greasy English breakfast! I choose the vegetarian option and it came with halloumi.
21,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"It was my first time @Greenwoods and it exceeded my expectations!  Excellent location and food, very kind staff, very generous portions and care in the presentation of the dishes, very fast service!  I will definitely return and I highly recommend it!"
22,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"I appreciate the fact that they offer a vegan full English breakfast (although without baked beans, which was a shame). However, it was quite bland. Scrambled tofu and mushrooms were tasteless. It's a pity, as there are some great recipes out there for making a delicious vegan full English breakfast."
23,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Lovely full English breakfast. One of the few places in Amsterdam where I found decent English tea.
24,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Nice place for lunch , nothing wow! Food has a fair prices , interior can be bit better . Stuff is really great , pleasant & kind."
25,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 4 stars ,7 months ago,This place is absolutely amazing for a morning breakfast or brunch in a sunny day. I tried the eggs royal with salmon and it was good. It came on a bed of hash browns and i believe i would have enjoyed a sourdough bread more. The place is bit over priced. In general it was a lovely experience with an amazing view. highly recommended
26,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Brilliant food and drink. A really great time and cosy atmosphere.
27,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Super delicious food üòã
Many vegan and vegetarian üå± options on the menu.
Very friendly service ‚ù§Ô∏è"
28,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Has a nice view if you seat outside, the staff is friendly but the price is way too high for the food served. Sorry, cook, but everything has the same taste. Like the tomato and the bacon. If all tables are taken, be prepared to wait more than 2 hours for your food to arrive after you ordered."
29,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We tried nearly all breakfast plates and we were never disappointed. Eggs were so delicious and i especially liked the mushrooms they serve with the eggs. The pancakes were great with the yummy maple syrup.

31,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolute fantastic food, but do be patient when coming on a Sunday as it‚Äôs a super popular place. But it‚Äôs worth the wait to get a table. Food came quick once we got a table. Good coffee and priced very reasonable. Top place to have an extraordinary breakfastüëçüèª"
32,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Breakfast composed of generally nice ingredients. The place isn't supercozy to be inside during bright summerday, but are probably more cozy during autumn time. Hard to catch waiters attention to get something, even though they were really nice."

Vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options."

41,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Solid breakfast spot. They do not have a lot of tables, so depending on time of arrival you may have a wait. WiFi not working (may have been just the time we went but certainly important for some I'm sure to know)."
42,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Research said this was one of the best brunch spots in Amsterdam, so I had to try it. The coffee was just ok, nothing special and I also personally prefer my coffee in a mug.  BUT I am still dreaming about the French Toast!  Amazing!"
43,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We were staying in nearby hotel so it came as an obvious choice. Great reviews and some yummy food pictures persuade us to pay a visit to this small establishment. ‚Ä¶

48,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place for breakfast! Chai latte was tasty as were our breakfasts. We ordered the banana bread and the pancake stack; they were both great.

50,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Our overall experience was not great.  May be because it was busy, but the english full breakfast was very average in taste.  The staff were just not in the mood.  The ambience is cosy and english, but the food was not great."
51,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic breakfast. We had the yoghurt and the pancake stack wich was great. A breakfast meal is around 12 euros. The staff is very nice and they have a couple of seats outside by the river.

54,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is great place to come for breakfast or brunch. I had the Full English and I simply couldn't complain. The food and staff are amazing. I would however recommend reserving a table as it can get busy.
55,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Rigid menu and do not allow for alterations to dishes.  Overly friendly waitress that is very artificial.  Had the Vegan curried tofu breakfast, hash brown was cold in middle unfortunately. Overall missed high expectations from trip advisor reviews."
56,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A good place for breakfast and delicious food. I had the royal breakfast dish with salmon and poached eggs. It was very good, but I would recommend replacing the hash brown with toasts. ‚úÖ"
57,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great atmosphere and the food is amazing. Also opens at 9.30 which is early for around here. ‚Ä¶
58,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Terrible food experience. Only giving 2 stars because the waitress was nice. The cappuccino and the food was stone cold. Due the big tourist traffic they just rush you through and serve with not good quality food/drink.

63,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is something special for lovers of perfect breakfast. There seasonal offers and regular menu. Make a table booking or you would have to wait sometime. Food is very delicious and served by awesome staff. Locals and visitors recommended to visit.
64,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The service staff was amazing, offered good recommendations, the food is great, I had the eggs Benedict with herb potatoes, really good, everything else being ordered looked very good, even the vegan options.

65,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Service is speed, large drink joices, good qualities product (the salmon is so soft...), we ordered 3 diff breakfast meals, each were delicious !"
66,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The waitress came to us and said bluntly without any greeting: ‚ÄúNext time you need to wait for the table to be seated, OK?‚Äù. But minutes ago, her colleague, a waiter came to us and led us to that table. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èSuper rude attitude. ‚Ä¶"

72,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food but definitely a tourist trap. Beware if you sit inside the acoustics are very poor, it will be difficult to hear the person across the table from you. The service was friendly and the mega club is very tasty. If you come here be prepared for a significant wait and ask to sit outside if possible."
73,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Be prepared to wait for a table. If you're lucky (which we were on both our visits to Amsterdam) you'll get a table right by the canal in the sun. ‚Ä¶
74,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Busy place but they managed to find a place for us to sit outside. Really lovely staff and just great food. Highly recommend this place for breakfast.
75,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,2 years ago,10/10!!  Very good ingredients used of top quality! One of the nicest breakfasts ive had. I come from london uk.  But this is top of them.  Fresh squeezed orange juice.  Amazing
76,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of my favorite brunch places. It's almost always a little (or a long) wait depending on what time you get there. But the wait is definitely worth it. The food comes out pretty quickly after you've ordered and the staff is friendly even ‚Ä¶
77,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I have to say I was already biased, as I heard multiple friends and colleagues saying Greenwoods was *the best brunch/lunch place in Amsterdam*. And of course all reviews online... I had ""Eggs Greenwoods‚Äù, and my friend had a Tuna salad ‚Ä¶"

80,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 1 star ,3 months ago,"We were really looking forward to eat at Greenwood's, unfortunately: the food wasn't good, the dishes were dirty, the tea tasted like old bacon fat, and there were no Covid safety measures whatsoever."
81,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful place for breakfast (and probably for lunch). It was recommended by some friends and was one of the best tips. The meals were great, the coffee was very good and also the tee."
82,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,8 months ago,I cannot recommend enough the very vegan brunch : it is so far the best vegan brunch I've had in Amsterdam although the plate is quite big and we were not able to finish it. A smaller portion of 'scrambled eggs' would have been better.
83,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"So good! Extremly Friendly Staff, super tasty Food and amazing Coffee! What more could you ask for?"
84,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome place!  Googles where to go for breakfast and we weren't disappointed!  Food was delicious, service was friendly, and had my first English breakfast!  Stop by here for a great breakfast/brunch!"

87,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Gone majorly downhill! DO NOT BOTHER.  HORRIFIC service and the interior is seriously run down. We booked a table and waited 32 mins (!) before just walking out. No one acknowledged us after we sat down, took our order or even apologized ‚Ä¶"
88,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Good food, but one of the baddest service I have ever experienced. Waited 40 minutes to place the order and the waitress didn‚Äôt seem to care too much about us .. the place was half empty ‚Ä¶.."
89,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Business breakfast? Breakfast date? Just a healthy start to the day? Do it here. Very nice and cozy atmosphere. Good selection of food whether you're the yoghurt and granola or the full English type, and you can ask for small tweaks. ‚Ä¶"

141,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Overall good experience. Eggs Benedict are good except for the toast which didn't seem fresh. The place is usually crowdy so you wait quite some time to eat. It's a bit dark for breakfast and music could be better - we felt like eating dinner not breakfast in that set up ;)

Maybe I had the bad luck to order the worst dish on the menu, since people are flocking the place. So avoid the english breakfast and order something else."

The scone we had ordered was not fresh and no cluttered cream but old butter and tasted horrible. And not to talk about the price....
175,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I had the sweet stack and the actual pancakes itseld was mediocre at best. I also had fresh squeezed orange juice that had no flavor maybe bad oranges? And my friend got the eggs Benedict and it was also mediocre. This place is trying way too hard to be fancy and they sacrificed the quality of the food for presentation.

185,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It's a nice place with good breakfast. I ordered eggs eith swlmon and the quality was good. It was very busy with mamy people waiting. I wouldn't describe it as a cozy place because of the small space between the tables and all of those people waiting to find a table. The staff is very friendly.
186,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The place was so busy and the waiting time was long. I was originally sceptical about how good it can be (how different club sandwiches and English breakfast can be?). The club sandwich was really good so in all fairness it was the best club I've had. I don't eat bread but even without bread the portion was very generous.
187,Greenwoods Keizersgracht, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very pleasant place to have breakfast, on a nice location. Menu is a bit limited, consisting of eggs with xyz, a burger and two salads, but the food is good. At a contrast, the drinks come is a huge variety. Prices are standard for Amsterdam."
