0,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great place to have breakfast/brunch/lunch. The food is prepared at the moment, so if you are going at peak hours, you can expect quite a long waiting time (30 mins), but it's totally worth the wait! ‚Ä¶"
1,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Yummy breakfast food, real American pancakes and great crispy bacon."
2,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice place for nice breakfasts all day.

3,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great place fir a casual lunch with terrific food
Nice people serving
And excellent dim sum"
4,Betty Blue, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice and spacious (rare in Amsterdam) interior and outdoor seating. Coffee and food wasn't great for the price, I'd come back for a drink. Not open during evenings though, like many of these places. There's a lot of cakes, didn't try as I prefer savory. Friendly but somewhat chaotic service."
5,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great food, friendly staff and nice ambience! I can‚Äôt eat bread (gluten intolerant) and they let me substitute potato wedges for the bread (‚Ç¨1,50) with the scrambled egg breakfast. Loved the breakfast and the fact that it came with greens! Wish I took a pic of the plate, but was pretty hungry and started eating right away :)"
6,Betty Blue, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,"What a joke ü§®
20 min to get a cold coffee
Another 15 min to get a slice of cake we ordered the same time as the coffee... ‚Ä¶"
7,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"We had a great lunch. Only 4 stars because service was very slow, and kind of ectic : people who arrived way lomater after us were served what we ordered 20 minutes before us.
Nonetheless waiters were nice"
8,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A nice spot for a decent brunch. The menu is not extensive, but is is varied with some delicious sounding dishes. I opted for the chicken and waffles, and while it‚Äôs a bit different from what I get at home, it was not disappointing. The service was fast and the staff was super friendly. Check out this place if you‚Äôre in the area."
9,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great breakfast. Fantastic pancakes. Freshly squeezed juices. üëçüèª
10,Betty Blue, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Staffs were really slow to come take our orders and they forgot that we wanted to pay and leave so we had to wait even after we finished everything on the table. We had layered pancakes which was really just normal pancakes and the Mexican ‚Ä¶

Great food, great atmosphere and very nice staff."
12,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We had a lovely brunch here. The staff are lovely and professional. The food was delicious and the coffee was excellent. The only criticism is that they use unnecessary plastic stirrers in some drinks.
13,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,6 months ago,This is my first time at this place and i must to say its really cool and pretty caf√©! The waitress are smiling and the atmosphere is comfy and the menu is ideal. Cakes are deliscious and the bettys bacon toast is great too! Love this place

15,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Glad we found this place. Good atmosphere, clearly very popular. We really enjoyed our food and would recommend it as a place to visit for brunch / lunch. I had a crispy tortilla with Mexican accomplishments and it was really tasty. Chai latte also very good."
16,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,5 months ago,This was a breath of fresh air! Food was fresh and super delicious. But the service was really the star. The staff was so friendly and attentive. PS: order the huevos mexicanos!
17,Betty Blue, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Friendly staff, unfortunately the bacon sandwich was very mediocre."
18,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful place, nice atmosphere and great pancakes, you get 9 pancakes to share for ‚Ç¨18 (can also have a solo option) it comes with either bacon or fruit and syrup. My only complaint is that there aren't different options for syrup like ‚Ä¶"

24,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Has a nice atmosphere, in a good location of Amsterdam. Staff are friendly, the lunch was amazing. The service was really fast. Bit noisy due to the fact that it's always busy."
25,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Beautiful Ford, tasty......BUT the  girl behind  tne drinks is VERY ANGRY  ALL THE TIME SHE WAS RUDE WITH OTHERS AND FIGHT WITH THE WAITER....TRY TO RELAX AND BE HAPPY"
26,Betty Blue, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Lured by the hippie outer wall color, a good alternative in the buzzy neighborhood. Kinda raw and vintage interior, recommend the lemon cheesecake (ate too fast so no pic sorry), get a mix juice as well! Oh, don‚Äôt count on the WiFi if that‚Äôs the reason you go to a cafe, because their WiFi doesn‚Äôt work!"
27,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place to stop of breakfast! They have a welcoming atmosphere and friendly staff. The menu was a little more Spanish style than I was expecting but their Huevos Mexicano was very tasty.
28,Betty Blue, 2 stars ,3 months ago,Good food. Extremely slow service and the staff act as if you are not there
29,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food in the area around the Nieuwmarkt. Very nice home made lemonade and if you like grilled cheese sandwiches try the one with cheddar, bacon and guacamole. Visitors are mainly younger people."
30,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had a lovely breakfast, served by a lovely waitress. Both a vegan option and the poached eggs were served with an explosion of flavours, leaving us in awe. The cakes we had were great as well, I definitely found a new favourite place."

36,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,2 months ago,Good food and very nice coffee
37,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent brunch. Average staff like everywhere in Holland but food was good. Recommended if you want to eat good food but then you need to run after the waiter to bring you check and other things you need. Also arm yourself with a lot of patience
38,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely interior and a great selection of cakes. The coffee is a bit mediocre, but nothing I can‚Äôt look past"
39,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very nice Place. Tasty Waffles and Pancakes
40,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very interesting and surprising food combinations. Friendly staff.
41,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Nice food with good quality! slow service...
42,Betty Blue, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Burgers are made from cheap sausage meat, the coffee wasn't extracted properly and the waffles were tasty with a side of avocado, but servings aren't generous at all. Not sure why this place is on Amsterdam brunch top lists. It's fine, but that's as far s I'd go - there are much better brunch spots around."
43,Betty Blue, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The food was the only good thing about this place. Waited in line with my friend for 30 minutes while the waitress kept walking past us and avoiding eye contact. Then when we finally got seated and ordered it took another 45 minutes for a ‚Ä¶
44,Betty Blue, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely staff but slow service. Nice place. I recommend you to taste ""chicken & waffles supreme"". Interesting contrast of flavours.
Warning: if you will pay by credit card, +1‚Ç¨ extracharge. Incredible!
So, 4* become 3*"
45,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great staff, good beer, excellent location - make sure to sit outside! Charges ‚Ç¨1 extra for use of card, so make sure to have cash!"
46,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow! What a great find. We just stumbled in for breakfast. The area is loaded with competition and they are the best of the bunch. My wife had the poach eggs. The plate was not only beautiful, but it was delicious. I had pancakes with bacon ‚Ä¶"
47,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Hip little restaurant / coffee house. They serve good coffee and tea, fresh lemonade and different kinds of cake. Most of the menu isn't very cheap. If you do want to get a cheap bite to eat however, you should take the soup! It's yummy and fresh and comes with warm buttered bread. The staff is also really friendly."
48,Betty Blue, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was flavorless. ‚ÄúPoached eggs‚Äù came as two eggs on top of a salad :-/ No bread. No potatoes. Nothing resembling breakfast, other than the eggs. Espresso coffee was light roast & lacked flavor. ‚Ä¶"
49,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best place for breakfast/brunch in Amsterdam. Welcoming staff, friendly atmosphere, incredible food & fantastic value. We have pretty much tried the entire breakfast & lunch menu on our trips with not a single fault. The pancake stack & ‚Ä¶"
50,Betty Blue, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Kitchen ticket machine was broken so we got our food after everyone else who came later than us.
Card machine was broken so we should have gone to the atm and got cash out. ‚Ä¶"
51,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Chicken waffle is amazing.
Salad also nice, fresh with good taste."
52,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,a year ago,"even if I'm not vegan and I ate proper Peruvian ceviche made by Peruvians, I really enjoyed the vegan ceviche and it came quite fast (good Job Chef !) , plus the waitresses are always smiling"
53,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Been here a few times, whether for breakfast with a big pile of fruity pancakes (right now!), for a coffee, or a Betty's burger special. Good atmosphere, mix of people (young, old, with / without kids), pleasant service. ‚Ä¶"
54,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"What a great place, doesn't seem the best from outside but inside is totally different. Nice big table, staff was very welcoming and the service was prompt and fast. The chicken sandwich tasted amazing and the coffee was definitely one of the best I have had!"
55,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is just normal, for semi-high price comparing to amount. Nice place to get a beer and eat some snacks, but if You want to eat dinner, order two portions per person. One star extra for nice and polite waitresess."
56,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cute cafe serving delicious fresh food, had the best smoked salmon. Their bloody Marys have a nice kick. Don't be in a rush though as the service is rather relaxed!"
57,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very busy place, but the staff remain very friendly. I asked for a vegan version of a 'flanmkuchen' and the lady told me immediately it was no problem. Which I think is lovely and professional. And it tasted VERY good. Thanks!"
58,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Yummy brunch and cake. Great vibe!
59,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I really enjoy having toasty and some of the lunch menus here. The cakes are too tempting to refuse, and it is very fresh! Redvelvet and the apple tarte is my favorite from their selection.  If only I was living close by, I would make a visit to here at least once a every 2 days."
60,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great coffee, really nice vibe and the cake was delicious. Would definitely recommend. Please is in Nieuwe Markt, which is a beautiful area in the city. also is a good place to work :). Will definitely return soon!"
61,Betty Blue, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Tried there burgers which were very good. However the low rating is mainly for the awful service. It takes a long time to get a staffs attention as they are completely disinterested and act indifferent. Be prepared to wait if you do visit the place.
62,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Delicious cakes! They also offer them to take away, in case you want to offer an awesome birthday present to your guests, as I did :-) ‚Ä¶"
63,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Stopped in for high tea. Service was friendly and attentive. The food was so so yummy. Every course was fantastic - they even prepared a special vegetarian menu for me. Couldn't even finish the last course there was so much! Highly recommend high tea at Betty Blue!
64,Betty Blue, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"If you want to wait an hour to be served, it‚Äôs the place for you."
65,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great food for a correct price.
The drinks are kind of pricey for what they are"
66,Betty Blue, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"This place literally stands for what over-rated is. Everything I ate and drank was absolutely horrible. It has a catchy name, it is placed in a very central area and probably that is why it attracts a lot of people. Even though the interior ‚Ä¶"
67,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Good original food. Fantastic thick pancakes.
Not for people who are in a rush since they take their time (long time) to prepare food."
68,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I really like this place for brunch  or lunch!  The food and drinks are delicious and the crew is super friendly. As it's located in a quiet busy area,  it may be difficult to find a place during the weekend."
69,Betty Blue, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The breakfast experience is okay. I had pancakes and they were good but nothing special. This place would get more stars but the staff was a bit rude and made the experience less enjoyable.
70,Betty Blue, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Furious that we had to wait for a server forever, then a server approached a couple that sat down next to us right away and asked to take their order. I interrupted with ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù to say that we had been waiting awhile already. She wanted ‚Ä¶"
71,Betty Blue, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Too noisy and the kitchen lacks proper ventilation which makes the whole place smell like fried food. Was planning to do some work and the Wi-Fi connection wasn't working properly.
72,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Everything was amazing except three things.
The black coffee was not good.
Also there is no air conditioning inside it was pretty hot.
And the cleaning i think they could do better ."
73,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The location is a bit difficult to get without a GPS or a good guide. I serached for '10 best bakeries/cakes in Amsterdam' and this one appeared on the map. Decoration looks straight out of a Cindy Lauper video, and the selections are good. ‚Ä¶"
74,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is something else. There's a hip otherworldly feel to it, and the menu showers you with palm trees and promises of modern Flammkuchen (Southern-German style flatbread pizza) with a variety of tasty toppings. This place inherited ‚Ä¶"
75,Betty Blue, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Awful Service. Stopped in for a quick bite and coffee, waited and waited for the food, after 45 minutes asked for the check instead.
To be fair, there was only one waiter helping people, but he actively told me to ‚Ä¶"
76,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best burger I‚Äôve ever had! And, the banana cake was amazing!
the staff was super friendly
It‚Äôs a must in Amsterdam"
77,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This was the first place I ate when I arrived in Amsterdam. It is easy to find and the staff is kind and helpful. When none of my cards worked in their machine, they allowed me to walk to the nearest ATM. I had a cup of tea and the Huevos Rancheros and they were divine. They hit the spot after 18 hours of traveling."
78,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,a year ago,"You would be a fool not to come to this restaurant for the food. But if for some reason you chose not to eat here, at least come for the music! I give props to the DJ for constantly having my head bob while I ate."
79,Betty Blue, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Burgers to be avoided. Cheap sausage meat and not the ""premium beef burger"" claimed on the menu.
Toast and tacos are good."
80,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place for lunch, not crowded, upscale people and quality food. Recommend if you just want to get out of the super touristic parts of Amsterdam"
81,Betty Blue, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Food is OK. Would pass on the burger and stick to tacos for lunch. Do not go here if you're planning to do work requiring wifi because it does not work...(have given it 3 chances).
82,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Menu says 2 chicken tacos... There was only one which was tasty and I couldn't have eaten 2... good service and very busy. Cakes looked great!
83,Betty Blue, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The only good thing about Betty blue is that the interior is cute. The food has no flavour, the banana bread was honestly disgusting and my beer tasted like dishwater."
84,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice lunchroom. Could use some acoustic diffusion the sound of voices and coffee grinders can build up to a pretty high volume, you almost have to shout to be able to hear the person next to you when it's crowded."
85,Betty Blue, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Cakes look better then they taste. The famous rainbow cake sells only at gay pride, not on other days!"
86,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Would definitely recommend - consistently good food, lovely staff, and nice decor/feeling. The chicken/bacon waffles and cakes are delicious."
87,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,a year ago,I have seen art work before but noting has spoken to me like little art shop. It is a gem. Great service. Thank you.

89,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The stack of pancakes were yummy!
90,Betty Blue, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Dreadful service. Waited 20 minutes for drinks  and then after the wait only 3 out of our 4 drinks arrived. I can only imagine the wait if we were to order food, we finished our 3 drinks and left immediately."
91,Betty Blue, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"good coffee, nice glutenfree cake, nice terrace to sit"
92,Betty Blue, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Sometimes slow (dirty tables are a bit of a thing), sometimes forgetful. Appalling ‚Äòcocktails‚Äô, but the beer and wine is good, food fairly good and ambience pleasant."

96,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"One of our favorite breakfast/lunch places. Service is a bit slow, but the food makes you forget the waiting time :)"
97,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had to come in because of the name... my fave 80s French film ... apart from the name there is no other reference to the film. Is this not why the name is Betty Blue ?
98,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,It was a good experience. Tea was great. We just had a broken cake beside the coffee. Couldn't get why it was broken :)
99,Betty Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The place is very nice. The service is good but can be improved. A little too pricey for what you get. The toilets really need to get in shape

105,Betty Blue, 3 stars ,3 years ago,This sweet potato Flammkuchen is more Insta worthy than it tastes... Crust too dry and no single synergy between ingredients. : /
