1,Cafe het Molentje, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Walking in Amsterdam on a gray wet day. Needed a beer and stopped here. I found a beer that I enjoyed and a light snack. Service was friendly and quick. Place was busy for the time of day and had a very pleasnat local feel.
2,Cafe het Molentje, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Cozy little place. The serving and the food were nice. The staff is polite and helpful and the location is great to stop for a hot drink and a snack when exploring the city.
3,Cafe het Molentje, 1 star ,3 years ago,We accidentally sit here. We were looking for the cafe next to it as they have good reviews of coffee. But we were hungry too so decided to stay here. Wish we didn't though. ‚Ä¶
4,Cafe het Molentje, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I had my first English breakfast here after living in Amsterdam for 1 year ( I'm English :). It was actually very good in my humble opinion.

5,Cafe het Molentje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely place to sit and people-watch. We sat outside by the canal. Service was excellent... Prompt and attentive without being intrusive. Delicious burgers... I had cheeseburger, my husband had bacon burger, and we can recommend both!"
6,Cafe het Molentje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Terrific cafe!  Friendly staff with quick service.  I had a grilled cheese sandwich and roasted tomato soup. The soup was delicious, one of the best tomato soups I have had.  The coffee was also phenomenal.  My friend had the pea soup which she loved.  Definitely worth stopping by if you are shopping in the area."
7,Cafe het Molentje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love this quaint bar. The food was good and a relaxing spot to sit and just watch the scene. The bitterballen were great and so was the toasted sandwich. Stop you and enjoy!
8,Cafe het Molentje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is wonderful. I sat in one of their canalside tables and watched Amsterdam go by for two hours. The horse carriages go right by. Friendly staff, good beer, tasty bitterballen, and tables with a view. Not to be missed!"
9,Cafe het Molentje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Charming little place, perfect for a drink and a snack - yummy bitterballen chased with a local beer. Great spot for people watching too."

30,Cafe het Molentje, 1 star ,3 years ago,Worse customer service ever .
