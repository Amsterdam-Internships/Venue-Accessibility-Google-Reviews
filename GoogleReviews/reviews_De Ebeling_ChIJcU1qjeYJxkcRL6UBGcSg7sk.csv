0,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great menu.

Amazing service and very tasty gin tonics. ‚Ä¶"
1,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Busy and loud, but have great cheerful and youthful vibe. I like coming there for early dinner to eat their great flammkuchen. Then, the tables are put away and the party starts. If you don‚Äôt mind the crowds and loud music, you will have a great evening!"
2,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"One of the best nacho platter I had.
Really nice aperol spritz too!
For an aperitif style highly recommended!
Staff super nice & attentive !"
3,De Ebeling, 1 star ,2 months ago,"I can only assume that the 4.1 comes from trendy hipsters with more money than taste or sense.
The staff are rude, arrogant, unhelpful. The food is banal, often badly prepared ‚Ä¶"
4,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Located on the Overtoom and a quick walk from the Vondelpark or Marriott, but also a quick walk from the non touristy areas further west or south. ‚Ä¶"
5,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best places in Amsterdam city to have a decent meal for great price! The Flammkuchen was amazing!!! The staff is very friendly and proactive. There is very little waiting time, but you can sit outside and chill with your friends ‚Ä¶"

7,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice spot on the overtoom. Good for after work drinks for groups and lunch in the sun too. I had the pastrami and tryffle mayo flamkucchen and the smashed avocado and egg (with bacon) open sandwich. Both very tasty. The staff were really nice and the tunes are tyypically good. Really solid spot for me and my work friends.
8,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Good atmosphere, a bit different post covid, less busy. Looking for food? Try the flamkuchen, they are all as delicious !"
9,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Decent cafe/pub to go for drinks and/or food with a lively atmosphere in the evenings. They serve a nice selection food and also pints (which seems to be rarer in Amsterdam)! Large choiceof alcoholic & non-alcoholic drinks, lunch and dinner ‚Ä¶"

13,De Ebeling, 2 stars ,a year ago,What an experience. A place worth visiting with friends. It is worth the time to spend. I really want to advice people to visit this place. Cozy but i hope the workers will have more interpersonal skills. I ordered a drink with my friend. ‚Ä¶
14,De Ebeling, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely place and good atmosphere. Have been there a few times and their staff (although most of them friendly) seem very chaotic and uncoordinated the last few times. Three different servers at the table asking about drinks and still ending ‚Ä¶
15,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Big and comfy , nice one to go for dinner"
16,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice brunch/lunch spot. A friend who lives nearby visits all the time as his go to place.
We had a traditional dutch, possibly German, style pizza, a burger with the lot ‚Ä¶"

18,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place for drinks and eat after work (if you find a table, better to book). Nice place with nice service and quality. Not a place to go you want a quite drink/dinner. Its usually packed with lively people... Me included üòÅ"

23,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We've been there for the first time. the card is in dutch but still easy to find the things you like to eat. the vegan burger (with extra cheese) was delicious and i had the best crispy fries ever! we'll come up again :) oh and try the homemade ice tea with jasmin..mhmmmm
24,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had our first meal here after arriving in Amsterdam and continued to do so regularly for the almost 4 years we lived there. Burgers are amazing. Staff is nice. Loved to sit outside during summer and have one of their delicious Flammkuchen. Keep it up!
25,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We loved this restaurant. We rarely go to the same restaurant twice on vacation but we went to this restaurant twice! The drinks are great! I had the burger and my husband had the tuna melt both were amazing! Great service, friendly staff, & delicious food!"
26,De Ebeling, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Always very busy. 2 years ago i made a reservation for my birthday for around 50 people 3 months ago, and the place they provided was for like, 20 people max. They said we could expand as other tables leave but whats the point of a reservation then? All in all, overrated, much nicer places are there."
27,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A great casual restaurant, one of my favourites in Amsterdam. Some good beers available. Nice outdoor seating in front of the restaurant. Reassuringly busy without being uncomfortably crowded. Menu offers a good selection of very tasty ‚Ä¶"
28,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to enjoy a view drinks. Good price quality for amsterdam.
29,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I had an amazing burger here with a prawn patty and kimchi. It's really good to see something a little different and creative on the menu as far as burgers are concerned. Also had a G&T here which was very good. The gin selection is this ‚Ä¶
30,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had breakfast here! Really recommend it!
31,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing place to go out, very lively, great music, 2 bars one big and one smaller, wide selection of cocktails, gins & tonics, you can also order various snacks. Very gezzelig! Truly a Dutch place to hang out. Good for birthday celebrations, you can book a place."
32,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"My buddy and I both enjoyed our flatbreads which were pretty huge in size to be a ""late night snack"". We sat at the bar and befriended the bartender who was friendly, made good recommendations for beers and food. Fun atmosphere and good enough volume to hold a conversation. Definitely would go back!"
33,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Super fun place for a night out in Amsterdam! We were lucky to stay in hotel right opposite Cafe de Ebeling which became our night cap! Great music albeit super packed. Good spot to dance your dinner away!
34,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Really nice place. Good service, nice drinks.
Free toilets."
35,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice little local bar. Great burgers and a good beer selection. Outside seating on the pavement, and it's got a lively atmosphere. Really good for a quick bite or an evening drink outside."
36,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best cafe in Amsterdam.  We stopped in twice over 2 days.  Super friendly staff and great food!  Make it a point to stop in for a burger and a pint.
37,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Only had a drink, but menu looks great (with some traditional food mixed in to a varied menu). Great atmos, good music, friendly staff. Popular with locals and tourists alike"
38,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice chilled out pub/cafe. Nice selection of drinks. Good pub grub menu and really nice atmosphere with friendly staff. A good choice to visit if you are in the local area and a nice place to have a lazy Saturday lunch.
39,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing place in Amsterdam. Great food and drinks for just the right price. It‚Äôs strange to find so many places in Amsterdam overpricing in general, this place is not one of those. On top of that they have super friendly staff and an amazing Friday and Saturday party vibe!"
40,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good!!
we had steak salad , burger and salmon toast.
all was really good and the price is really worth it! each around 10-12 ‚Ç¨! ‚Ä¶"
41,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place for drinks, especially after work drinks. Great that you can book one part of the space for farewell parties or the like.
Nice staff"
42,De Ebeling, 2 stars ,4 years ago,I used to like this place a lot. Until once they didn't bring our sandwiches for an hour. They only noticed that they forgot us after we asked. They weren't very apologetic and we still had to pay for two little sparkling waters we had. I don't think I will go again.
43,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Nice atmosphere. Little selection of beers. Only went there a few times for drinks so I don't have feedback for the food. Extremely crowded on Friday and Saturday nights!
44,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great place! For Locals and turists :)
45,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Stumbled across this place by accident on our first day in Amsterdam. We were given an excellent recommendation for a Dutch beer to try, and tried a delicious cheese platter. Excellent service in impeccable English."
46,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Burger is great not too big. They have a nice selection of beer. Howling wolf is an excellent choice. Indoor and outdoor seating. Nice atmosphere.
47,De Ebeling, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice for people in their 20s. But don't go for the music. It's also way too hot inside, even in the winter. And staff behind the bar couldn't name the whiskeys they sell, which is pretty embarrassing."
48,De Ebeling, 1 star ,3 years ago,"disgusting vegan burger, no taste, no sauce, just lettuce and an unidentifiable patty. Went with friends and we were all so excited about the food and it silenced us all. My friend had an aweful ham burger and another friend's shrimp burger gave her food poisoning."
49,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We went on a Thursday for a drink with friends and it was very vibey - great music and drinks were not overpriced. Very local and great service from staff - will definitely be back, maybe for a Friday for a bit of a dance üòÑ"
50,De Ebeling, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We reserved a table but the group was still there until half an hour before we left. Thankfully there was a corner which would fit our group (admittedly, with quite a squeeze). One of the more expensive places to get a bottle / can of beer in the city."
51,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"THE best bar on the overtoom. And I need to say, the most friendly people ever are working there, which is rare to find in amsterdam. And special shout out to the lady at the door, Jasmijn! I would hire her if I had my own bar! ‚Ä¶"
52,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Editing the review.
Friendly personell but not overly accustomed to early customers.
Food is realy nice, three visits in one week. Beer was also more than fine."
53,De Ebeling, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Crowded, loud, live and fun! You can get some drinks after work, and stay to shake your body after 23:00. Affordable too."
54,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,3 years ago,This cafe is located in the street of Overtoom. Not far from the central square of Leidsplein. It as a good environment. A bit crowded the ast time i was there. Maybe because there was a party with a entire company there. This place as an entrace with an covered outdoor umbrella. Good while is raining and we are waiting to enter.
55,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very popular spot for after work drinks, it's more ample than it looks like from the outside. ‚Ä¶"
56,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great over day, good service. At night, goos music,  good people and a great atmosphere. Definitely a place to party and have good drinks"

58,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Gezellig casual cafe. Good atmosphere. Friendly people. Party style on Fridays and Saturdays. Beer, bar and bites. Nice outside seating in the summer months."
59,De Ebeling, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Interesting building, very special design. Visited at lunch time. Would like to go again for drinks. The food was ok. Explicitly asked for a salad without peppers and got one with loads.."
60,De Ebeling, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,"Worst service in Amsterdam, avoid."
61,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice for borrel after work or dinner. Can get really fun but also very during the weekend, but it's always a good choice to dance and meet people."
62,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"A great place for lunch! Good food and quick service! Freshly made orange juice, and great coffee. Nice to sit both outside and inside."
63,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Speaking for Friday and Saturday nights: this is as club-ish as a bar can get. It's very crowded and they play pop and house music. Neither expensive nor cheap. Fun times
64,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice spot near leidscheplein, they have some good burgers, but also proper plate dishes, they have special beers. The atmosphere is casual"
65,De Ebeling, 1 star ,3 years ago,Beer had mold in it.  Staff seemed to think it was lemon or paper.  But you could easily see from the greenish grey that it was obviously mold.  Either way they didn't think it was a big deal
66,De Ebeling, 2 stars ,4 years ago,We were asked to give up our high chairs at 9pm for no clear reason and from ten pm onwards the bar staff would only use normal glasses for your 5 Euro special draft beer... Bit weird.
67,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's a great place to dine. Later on weekend nights, it becomes a nice dance club for the brave."
68,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was my first time, and everything was DELICIOUS. The staff very friendly. There was no menu in English, but the staff explained everything I needed."
69,De Ebeling, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place for drinks, awesome venue but the food was pretty awful! We all had burgers and they were not good at all."
70,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good vibe and party for the night if you look for music in a disco bar setup and not a big club. Recommended!
71,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, good selection of beers, however so loud you need to shout for a whole night to your friends...its not a club...Came back home with half scraped through and sore ears...Otherwise a nice place with good food ;-)"
72,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, good prices, great staff. We may even come back again during our trip."
73,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, good service, but only Dutch menus. Can't say I fully knew what I was ordering but it tasted great!"
74,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Super fun lively bar that is a good spot for Friday night drinks.  Service is pretty good and gin and tonic options are delicious.

79,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wide beer choice, delicious salad and Bitterballen, friendly service. We recommend it!"
80,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Although it looks small from the outside, it huge inside. The Friday night we went it was super packed, making even the ventilation pipes dripping. Be prepared for loud music and quite some noise"
81,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Super friendly with quite good beer selection. Yes- they do have wine too
82,De Ebeling, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Usually fun! good terrace and good cocktails, the food is good too - tends to have a lot of locals now a days :)"
83,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food quality/price ratio with delicious bitterballen and local bers. Staff could be warmer.

90,De Ebeling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of my favorite places in the city. Just a bit too crowded on weekend nights for my personal taste
91,De Ebeling, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, but my god, worst service possible. Expect a 15 minute wait to order a beer at the bar. At least."
