Irish and folk sessions, great gigs, wonderful atmosphere and some of the greatest memories i got in Amsterdam. The reason i only give 5 stars is because there are no more to add."
22,Mulligans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A small but truly lovely Irish pub. Maybe even the most genuine Irish pub in the city of Amsterdam.

30,Mulligans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A really good, cozy and traditional Irish pub in the middle of Amsterdam. You can easily enjoy a few (or dozens) guiness listening to traditional Irish live music. The prices are, compared to the Amsterdam standard, quite cheap.

32,Mulligans, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Extremely expensive. We were there a few months ago and the bar lady asked us for 14‚Ç¨ for 2 drinks. The receipt looked like we'd ordered 5 drinks. On the bright side, they have had Irish square dancing which was a lot of fun."

Well worth a visit!"
42,Mulligans, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice little pub but musicians were incredibly unfriendly and rude when we were talking and staff did not handle it very well.

47,Mulligans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Proper Irish pub with Irish patrons.
