3,Chupitos, 1 star ,5 months ago,Couldn't even get in with tables available. Got told they reached there piek and it didn't matter if would give us table. First time at this place maybe next time will be better. Stay positive one love
4,Chupitos, 1 star ,4 months ago,I highly don't recommend going here!! I paid too much for the entrance and they didn't even let us in. Me and a group of friends were around the age of 20 but most of us couldn't get in after them telling us that you need to be above 21! I …
5,Chupitos, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Best food I‘ve eaten in a long time! <3

8,Chupitos, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Amazing service- good music
9,Chupitos, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Watch out, if you are NOT a girl, your drinks could be served SUPER SLOWLY!!!"
10,Chupitos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Such an amazing variety of shots! It's small and can be crowded but it's nice to stop for a shot or two and enjoy the music.
11,Chupitos, 1 star ,6 months ago,"The place is nice, but they sell you drinks with out the correct alcohol, they said that is mezcal and isn't."
12,Chupitos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy little place with awesome, friendly and professional staff who can all incredibly remember hundreds of different and interesting shots! …"
13,Chupitos, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Fun little shot bar but madly overcrowded. The shots they serve can be funny but almost always tasty. Because it is a shot bar it is quite a popular place for people to visit. Don't be surprised if you have to wait in line, even though it's never taken too long to get in for me."
14,Chupitos, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Good experience but not much dancer
15,Chupitos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Boom! Shots! Shots! Amazing place to dance in, and have some delicious shots! I recommend Harry Potter shots 😉"
16,Chupitos, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very fun place to go drink.
It is a bar / club in one. It is known for its wide variety of shots. You can also order a few kinds of beer.
The place is rather small and can be crowded."
17,Chupitos, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very tiny place (as most locations are). But super fun! Great music, and all those famous fire-based shots Chupitos is known for. Everything is cheap and delicious. Only drawback is the location as there aren't many other similar places around it."
18,Chupitos, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great bar, sometimes it's very very crowded. Other nights there's not a lot going on. The purpose of the bar is their shots. They have a great variety and fun staff. Very creative.  It's quite small and sometimes there's a few people dancing to the loud music."
19,Chupitos, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Its really a great place for a stupid night with friends! You can go in this very small place and enjoy some old fashioned disco music while enjoying a couple of weird chupitos. Of course if you want some style avoid this place. This is good for fun, not for showing off."
20,Chupitos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Every time that i've been there my night was amazing!!, is only a shot bar but u can have a  glass of beer or two :p or more, amazing shots from a huge list a lot of fun and dance!!! Recommented! :)"
21,Chupitos, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Wow this place is brilliant fun, it helps to have a few drinks in your system before you arrive and try and get here before it gets too busy as you have to check your bags and coats in their cloak room. Ensure you also have some small …"
22,Chupitos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome place, great shots for a cheap price, friendly people. Overall a great experience. A little on the small side but that has its charm as well"
23,Chupitos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"In general I am not that fond of shots.
They make you very drunk very quickly whithout really enjoying the journey there. …"
24,Chupitos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The bar may be small, but the shots are incredible  the music is great, and you won't break the bank on a night out. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Amsterdam."
25,Chupitos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place in Amsterdam, nice DJ, super friendly and funny staff. Many many options to get shots and thematics shots. The ""Trump tower"" was one of my fav. I recommend this placeee, if you wanna spend a good time with your friends."
26,Chupitos, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Definitely more fun than I had expected. Good shots, good show, good atmosphere, good DJ plays mostly poppy hiphop, reggae and tropical. Crowd was young though; mostly 20 year old British tourists."
27,Chupitos, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The price-drink ratio is great. Nice list of drinks with funny names.

Place can be packed quickly and there is no real dance floor. …"
28,Chupitos, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best shots bars in town. Lots of spectacular drinks with interesting and creative flavors. It's not cheap but the music and the staff are great. Good place for a pre-party
29,Chupitos, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Its a shots bar in the tourist part of Amsterdam, you get what you you would expect.  They play the music loud enough to have difficulty communicating with the bartenders.   Good selection of shots, servers were very nice."
30,Chupitos, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Horrible music, a cheap crowd, and a staff that refuses service if you appear even mildly drunk. Combine this with an obnoxious bouncer, and a ""you must use the cloakroom"" policy, and you're just better off avoiding this place. Also, aren't you too old to do shots by now?"
31,Chupitos, 1 star ,4 years ago,"This place is so overcrowded that you litterly stand against everyone and been shoffed around. People get fustraited to eachother, and one even wanted to start a fight with me. And last but not least is that it is impossible to get a drink because there are so many people. I wouldnt recommand going there to get your shots."
32,Chupitos, 3 stars ,a year ago,"I don't know how we got here, but pretty much standard bar - music, sticky floor, paid toilettes. But the selections of shots is alright."
33,Chupitos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tiny bar (but hey it’s Amsterdam). The shots are amazing, entertaining and fun! Not that expensive and always fun to go there."
34,Chupitos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere. Can get really crowded. The place itself is tiny, but it's got a really peng vibe and a huge range of shots to choose from (absinthe!!!!)"
35,Chupitos, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I asked for a 25cl beer, she filled it up to not even 20cl, and when I asked (very politely) if it would be possible to fill it up to 25cl, she just said no.
Afterwards I asked if it would be possible to give my friend a birthdayshot (as they did to a girl earlier), they said ""No, it's a guy""... Sorry but that's sexist..."
36,Chupitos, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice shots and a lot of choices! Also a lot of surprise shots which are kinda funny to prank your friends with! Only bad thing is that it gets busy pretty late..
37,Chupitos, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"This bar is nice if you like horrible commercial music and a variety of shots without any explanation. It is fun to have visited once, especially if you're a tourist."
38,Chupitos, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Had to take out a second mortgage, but it was definitely worth 2 of the delicious shots they serve here. Also apparently a great place if you are underage."
39,Chupitos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best place for crazy yummy shots in Amsterdam... Great crowd and staff, a bit too small yet fun to hang out for a while
Go for mother of dragon shot it's the best"
40,Chupitos, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Nice shots bar with exotic shots. The cheaper shots are not the way to go drunk. Always good atmosphere. Sometimes too young crowd.
41,Chupitos, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good place to enjoy shots with wide variety of options. It’s just that when I requested for something I didn’t get what I was expecting.
42,Chupitos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I always get a great mood at Chupitos. highly recommend. Best place for shots but the music sucks nowadays.
43,Chupitos, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I really like the shots they offer and the music is 80% of the time really good but the one down side of this place is is that its really small
44,Chupitos, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Wow what a performance the guys in the bar make and how much they love their job. Only downside was one of the bouncers that was high on something and started a fight with a visitor out of nowhere one time I was there.
45,Chupitos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome little place. Loads of different shots to choose from. Spectacular serving of drinks!
46,Chupitos, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great pub with hundreds of shots which have special names and are sometimes served in a special way. Perfect place to go before going to clubs
47,Chupitos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Crazy bar! Always full. Best shots ever. Good vibe. Ask for shots: Harry Potter and Chemestry

69,Chupitos, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Small, crowded, smells awful. Staff is okay and shots are nice"
70,Chupitos, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The staff working are racist, and won't let you in if you have darker skin complexion.  They don't even deserve 1 star."
