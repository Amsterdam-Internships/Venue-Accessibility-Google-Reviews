1,Fantasia Trattoria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Update Nov 2019: Came back here 4 years later. Great service but the vegetarian lasagna that I loved so much changed. The sauce is still amazing but there were hardly any vegetables in it. Instead, it was more like a ‚Äúcheese lasagna‚Äù than ‚Ä¶"

9,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We were looking for a family restaurant in the area. We were not interested in the usual American fast food ones, but too fashion either. Trattoria Fantasia was just the right choice: children enjoyed their delicious pastas and risottos and ‚Ä¶"
10,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Excellent and authentic Italian food and very friendly staff. You could ask for free tap water. We really enjoyed our experience here and will surely be back!
11,Fantasia Trattoria, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very fast and friendly service. Had the pizza Margarita which was more American style than Italian style. Loads of white cheese and thick, chewy crust."
12,Fantasia Trattoria, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The bruschetta was disappointing :( the pizza was nice and the tiramisu was good as well. The staff were friendly...Overall, an Ok place to visit in Amsterdam."

16,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very cosy, friendly staff. Great food!"
17,Fantasia Trattoria, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Strange that the impression on the website of the restaurant is about how it looks instead of how the food looks... Isn't the place about food?
18,Fantasia Trattoria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Read good reviews but heart sank when it appeared almost empty on arrival, especially as so many other places were busy and lively.  Food was great (had pizza) and it did start to fill up soon after we arrived.  Great for a quieter meal but not for those wanting to sit outside and watch the world as you eat."
19,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious pizza, thin base with crispy crust and plenty of toppings. Good selection of food, not huge but definitely catering to everyone. Plenty of wine and beer to try and a good atmosphere. Staff were attentive and friendly."
20,Fantasia Trattoria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Romantic and relaxed Italian restaurant. Good prices and a medium length menu for every taste. The pizza I had was big and OK in taste compared to some of the other pizza restaurants in Amsterdam for the same price, but my partner had a really good tasting pasta dish."
21,Fantasia Trattoria, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Good quality pizza's for a good price. Made an error in supplying the wrong pizza for my friend. She had to wait 15 min while I ate. We were ok with it since we shared. The waiter seemed really embarrassed and compensated us with discount and offered us drink from the house. We didn't take the offer though. The waiter was lovely
22,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A very nice and cozy place. service ad food take their time - but worth it, as it is as Italian as you can have in Amsterdam, and priced low for its quality. service is free from pretentious, friendly and generous. a perfect choice for dinner - friends or date. Wouldn't go with kids due to the relaxed timings."
23,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Cozy place, good service. They have an adorable cat named Olivia inside. Pizzas are quite big and might be challenging to finish for some, but they are good."
24,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Staff were very friendly. We had pizzas, which were great. Plenty of topping. Cute ginger cat came and set by us while we ate. Very well behaved, didn't try to steal the food, just wanted petting."
25,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great pizza! The only thing was that they forgot to bring us our desert. When we told them they offered us the desert for free, but we were tired of waiting, so we decided to leave. Still 5 stars, because the food was excellent and would definitely recommend it!"
26,Fantasia Trattoria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty good food for a decent price. Would of got 5 stars if I didnt have the waiter hanging over me waiting for me to finish and leave as the place was fairly quiet. All customer service issues aside great food tbh
27,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Typical Italian restaurant you will find anywhere in Italy, but this one is in Amsterdam. Really good."
28,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, quick service, and the house cat who will visit if it is not very busy. What more could you want? Highly recommend, especially early in the evening on a week day."
29,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic food for a very great price. I was really surprised how large the portions were too. Would absolutely recommend. Service was kind and accommodating as well.
30,Fantasia Trattoria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We had pasta with pesto and pizza margherita. The guy working there was very nice and very service oriented. Food was good and cheap. If there was to complain for anything the pasta with pesto hadn't so much salt.
31,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"We made a last-minute reservation on a Friday night for 24 people, and Trattoria Fantasia accommodated amazingly. All dishes were served almost simultaneously, the bill was correct, and ultimately inexpensive to boot. Thanks for a wonderful night, we will certainly return!"
32,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place, unpretentious with great tasting food. Make sure you stay for dessert as well, you won't regret it. This place is rarely busy, so feel free to just walk in and ask for a table. This place is also great for groups for whatever occasion - a date, an anniversary, celebrating somebody's birthday, or just a night out."
33,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Reminds me when I was in Italy pizza was great! And Desert perfect. Prices are average Amsterdam prices. They have a cat so that means it‚Äôs a good restaurant ;)
34,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"AMAZING FOOD!!! Really good service too, although we were the only people in the restaurant sadly (too bad for everyone who couldn‚Äôt enjoy it with us) At least we got to have the adorable chubby chonk (cat) all to ourselves!"
35,Fantasia Trattoria, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Service wasn‚Äôt good and food was disappointing, bet the pizza was a frozen one from the supermarket."
36,Fantasia Trattoria, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Cute place but my first time going i ordered the risotto, it was nice but i got food poisening after. So im not going there again!!"
37,Fantasia Trattoria, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Bruschetta was quite dry with no cheese and not enough olive oil. Special dish was chestnut & truffle ravioli which was OK, but came a bit cold and definitely not worth 18euros! Caneloni was OK, but forgettable. Wine was good."
38,Fantasia Trattoria, 1 star ,6 years ago,"The service was atrocious. There were only 3 tables in the restaurant but due to, what I can only put down to the fact we did not speak Italian, we barely made it on to the waiter's priority list. While our nearest table had been served and ‚Ä¶"
39,Fantasia Trattoria, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Completely horrible. Had a ""lasagne"", pure pasta with a tad of tasteless sauce on top. My friend had a pizza with a bad bottom, but at least he got some food out of it. ‚Ä¶"
40,Fantasia Trattoria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The pizza was great but the server was a little cold towards us.  Restaurant was quiet at the time we went, just one more couple apart from us."
41,Fantasia Trattoria, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was good, and decently priced although it needed a bit of salt. :) had the arrabiatta and carbonara. the waiter (owner?) was very friendly and accommodating. Would come back just for that."
42,Fantasia Trattoria, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The pizza is always good and fast when order online  ! Just The lady waitress was kinda B  and we felt like leaving at one point, her responds were rude & offensive , am not sure if I will go there again but chances unless not while she‚Äôs there"
43,Fantasia Trattoria, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Drinks were good and staff were friendly and helpful. The risotto and pastas were had though were an embarrassment to Italian cuisine. Risotto was essentially overcooked rice with mushrooms and water, no stock or seasoning at all."
44,Fantasia Trattoria, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very good to excellent.
The  Baked Lasagna  Bolonaise was a real treat, went back twice to make sure it was that good. ‚Ä¶"
45,Fantasia Trattoria, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I had the bruschetta and ceaser salad to start, followed by pizza and finally tiramisu and espresso. All were OK at best - nothing too bad but definitely nothing to shout about. Staff were friendly."
46,Fantasia Trattoria, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Just a typical low quality tur√≠stic pizzeria... Close to the downtown.
But the pizza is not bad.
For sure that there are better options, but if you want to stay in a quite place, this is your place....
