0,Sranang Makmur, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"They forgot the rice and gave me an entire new meal, very nice people. Definitely recommend this place."
1,Sranang Makmur, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"a nice place to eat  Indonesian food, you can chit chat with the several Indonesians‚Äã that live  here & discussing about Indonesia"
2,Sranang Makmur, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Come here almost every week, excellent food, friendly staff and good pricing! What more can one wish?  A new machine for my weekly cup of dawet would make it a perfect experience(lol)."
3,Sranang Makmur, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Amazing. I asked the very nice waitress to help me choose and she recommended a mixed platter of Infonesian food and it was really good. 5+ different and really tasty things. The interior is also very nicely decorated and cozy. I wish we had an Indonesian restaurant in my neighborhood.
4,Sranang Makmur, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Highly recommend this place! The food is mostly under ‚Ç¨10 which is very reasonably priced. The owner is also a very nice man. However there is no English menu but if you can speak Bahasa, the owner can recommend you some food. My recommendation is the Soto ayam, gado gado and nasi makmur :)"
5,Sranang Makmur, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The saoto soup is nice and the banana and gado gado. The other dishes are just ok. Sometimes a bit dry. When ordering online / using home delivery they always forget to pack something and you have to call. Home delivery also takes quite some time to arrive (usually over 40 minutes).
6,Sranang Makmur, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food was okay and not too pricey. But had too much oil in it. We hoped it'll be a small authentic restaurant but it turned out more fast food type. Still the decorations were very interesting and the service itself was nice.
7,Sranang Makmur, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place is SO good. I can't even emphasize this. SO GOOD. Here's the confusing thing -- I think there's one section for take-out and one area that's a restaurant. I went to both... Yes, during my short stay in Amsterdam, I ended up ‚Ä¶"

14,Sranang Makmur, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Honored to have this this at my local restaurant, went for the first time last Thursday and could not have been happier with the food and the price. All the Dutch I know locally in the Watergraafsmeer area also speak highly of it."
