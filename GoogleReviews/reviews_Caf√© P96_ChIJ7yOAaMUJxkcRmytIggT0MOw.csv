0,Caf√© P96, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice place to have a drink or even a breakfast/lunch with a perfect view of the channels. The tables are on a boat at the opposite side of the street, thus, when it is crowded, you should wait a little bit more for the service, but it is worth it."

3,Caf√© P96, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Plain and simple 'gezelligheid' in a typical Dutch bar. Nice beers, nachos are good and the staff is attentive. Location is nice (as is the terrace boat in front)."
4,Caf√© P96, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great Dutch beer bar with tasty food. The bar is cool but the best bit is the awesome spot in front where you can sit on an old barge and enjoy the canal and the sun.
5,Caf√© P96, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a typically trendy Amsterdam bar serving good beer and good food, made all the better by having it's own barge, made into an outdoor seating area moored up on the canal. Excellent."
6,Caf√© P96, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One block away from the Anne Frank house.  Wonderful people watching with outside patio.  Directly across from the canal- with part of the restaurant sitting on a boat in the canal.  Had a great chicken sandwich with cheese, sauce and guacamole.  Would highly recommend for a quick bite and a drink."

We left to find a better place for a lunch. It's a pity, because the prices seemed to be ok and the place looks really nice."
16,Caf√© P96, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A beautiful bruin cafe with extra seating nearby on a boat. It's self service on the boat but they give you a buzzer so you know when your food is ready. Delicious pub food and wide selection of drinks. This place is great.
