17,Vijfnulvijf, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"A variety of Asian cuisines (Thai curry, Chinese dim sum, Japanese sushi) and some fusion options. Small plates were good (though a tiny bit expensive given how small the plates were), but the red curry was just ok. It was just a bit too sweet. Service was fine.

24,Vijfnulvijf, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What a discovery! A friend advised this restaurant and I gave it a try when I was close by. Super nice staff and the rendang and Korean chicken was delicious. Best Asian food I had since years.
25,Vijfnulvijf, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Good  variety of sushis for reasonable price. Service is friendly. The place has an ascetic decoration. Well... happy to have a good sushi place in the east side of town.
