5,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great place in Amsterdam to try many different types of beers! Friendly staff and a cute cat outside too. We had the veggie burger and the croque monsieur, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend either - they're not great because it is typical bar food. But definitely go for the beers."
6,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"There‚Äôs an abundant selection of beers to choose from. And if that doesn‚Äôt help you make a choice, ask the bartenders and they will help you find the right one. ‚Ä¶"

13,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Relaxed atmosphere, good beer. Selection on tap not that big and special, for beer lovers, but maybe it's just not the season for my favourites."
14,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Large selection of beers for an average price. Next to that some basic food. One of the three locations in town.

20,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nicely located. Reasonably priced. Server was cold and seemed like he didn‚Äôt like foreigners. I went for the Gandalf‚Äôs burger that also come with fries (see picture). Very good, super slippery."

25,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The beer selection, the stew, the music, well... I can say that the Gollem's is one of my favorites places in Amsterdam, a bit outside in the center so the people that gather there are tourists. Highly recomended"
26,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great bar but the cat wasn't great at scrabble

29,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I just finished my 1 beer here at Gollem. I wanted to get food and try several beers, but the waitress assigned to my area ignored me after getting my beer and getting my menu for food. She walked by me to serve tables with more patrons. Ok then, my money wasn‚Äôt good enough for you. Sad that they‚Äôre horrible people."

33,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Very tasty beer for all different tastes, nice atmosphere. Some staff is super good, but some is awful."

38,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you like beer, this is THE place, lot's of options  on tap and bottled, enough to make it hard to choose. Unlike some other bars, they do have real food, that tends to be quite tasty. Staff is always friendly. But, beware: it's often crowded, so you might want to make reservations."

40,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wide range of beer, nice kitchen and of course cat. The perfect mix for the evening with friends."

45,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great beers, food, atmosphere."
46,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,8 months ago,What's not to like about a place with so many beers? Good selection of gluten free as well.
47,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Largest of the Gollem pubs, good beer selection"
48,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The best (yet affordable) food in Amsterdam (especially the stew!)
49,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you come to Amsterdam and want to have a couple of brews in proximity to some native Dutch, this pub belongs near the top of your list. Free from tourists and menu full of a variety of beers to try this is a wonderful place to spend an ‚Ä¶"
50,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is amazing for exploring craft beer in a cozy (gezellig) and lay back environment. Beside the massive selection of beers, you can have some nibbles like cheese or charcuterie boards."
51,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Used to be much better. It's still good - but the prices became outrageous. 6 euro for a small beer is a common price there. Pity. Finger food was very good. Really - it's great, just overpriced for simple Belgian beers you get somewhere else for 3.80."
52,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Staff great
Staff know their products
If you ask for 0,0% ‚Ä¶"
53,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a great evening here with my partner,  Big shout to Marc for table service, very busy little place so booking would be recommended. we turned up without booking but luckily people left so got a table. Had a very interesting conversation ‚Ä¶"
54,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 3 stars ,a week ago,The sad bit is how much better it used to be.
55,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I love this unpretentious bar. The beers are excellent.The staff are friendly and very knowledgable so if you want something they can help you chose. The food is good but not very varied.
Great beer...  but I mentioned that before."
56,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"If you like beers, this is a really good place to go! They also had a band playing a bit of jazz music on the Saturday evening we were there. Would definitely go there again!"
57,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Loved it. Everyone was very nice. Awesome place to get Belgian beers and other beers on tap. Tried the Trappist cheese plate because we are fans of Trappist beer, and it was good when paired with the bread, balsamic and mustard. The Gollem Blonde was our favorite beer of the night."
58,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best Belgian beer bar in Amsterdam. Noisy and crowded, just the way it should be. Huge selection of beers on tap and in bottle. Also serves bar food and dinner."
59,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We had dinner here last night and it was alright. They have a ton of beers, which is really nice, but not so much draft beer unlike their other cafe at Rembrandt plein. Our food was nice, not so special. I ordered a medium rare stake and it ‚Ä¶"

62,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Relaxed atmosphere and staff really knows the beers (had some great recommendations that I wouldn't have thought of myself). Every Saturday live jazz music is awesome!
63,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I used to come here every weekend, probably spent hundreds of euros in this pub as I love craftbeer. Not anymore.
One day I was walking with my family including my 7 year old who was finishing ‚Ä¶"
64,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best beer places in Amsterdam. Variety of beers on the draft and bottle. Good place to watch games too, but can be crowded due it's popularity."
65,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 1 star ,2 years ago,Extremely dissapointed and actually surprised by the rude service! The food and the beers are good but definitely  avoid if you would like to go to a friendly bar where you can enjoy a nice evening with friends. Will not come back.
66,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,7 months ago,A great place to have a beer and a bowl of mussels with a smile üòä
67,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A good place with many options of beer. The staff is friendly. The food took a little to arrive, enough to appreciate the place and the beer. ‚Ä¶"
68,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome beer selection and good ambiance. Food was a bit bland (over-cooked and season-less burger), but that shouldn't be the reason why you come here! Would recommend!"
69,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service, wonderful beers, relaxed atmosphere, fries... amazing!!!"
70,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very hostile staff. We waited 20 min and finally decided to get up and ask for a beer, staff were angry that we did not wait further. After that they brought beer with glass half empty. ‚Ä¶"
71,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"the perfect bar, even had a cat and phone chargers"
72,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I really wanted to love this place, but it fell somewhat short. I love Flemish food and beer, and this place has that stuff. However, service was slow, and the draft Belgian beers came out foamy but flat. The stoverij, Flemish beer stew ‚Ä¶"
73,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Beer selection and staff are fine, one star down because bartender did not filled our jenever shot to the top how are we used to in other places (sip without hands first, than drink)."
74,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Good food, beer selection and kind personnel."
75,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is just a really nice beer cafe. They are specialized in Belgian beers, but there is a wide selection of beer from other countries as well. Staff very nice and friendly."
76,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place, good beers but the food was not so great... To much cheddar and sauce."
77,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty frites, friendly service, stellar beer list, and shady available outdoor seating all within pleasant walking distance of vondelpark. We stopped for a quick beer and ended up staying for a few hours."
78,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Although you have an almost obscene amount of different beets both draft as well as bottled, it still feels and looks like an old almost cheap caf√©. The terras out front is nice enough by itself, but the road it's beside is quite busy so not very relaxxing."
79,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"In a very busy street, a very busy bar. It is not the cosiest bar in the city, but cool to hang out for a while. The selection of beers is very good, after all it is a proeflokaal. I recommend visiting with a group of friends, expect loads of tourists in the summer months. It is an ideal stop while heading down Overtoom."
80,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing place, a nice call for a few burgers and beers!"
81,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Way way too busy and overpriced. Once they got popular (good for them!), They raised the prices and it stopped being fun as soon as it's just a sea of people pushing each other around. There's plenty of other fun, less busy, beer caf√©s around so I'd avoid avoid avoid."
82,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great spot for a cozy beer. Huge and interesting selection
83,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing beer selection for reasonable prices (recommend their home brand ipa, super refreshing), very lovely staff and plus you can sit outside and enjoy the lovely weather üòé"
84,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best bars in the city.  Only Gollems that has a full food menu (I believe). ‚Ä¶
85,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Great variety of beers (mainly Belgian) in nice place, possible to sit outside as well, gets crowded often. I've also tried dinner or other warm snacks and all are great."
86,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"So many beers & honestly I couldn't find one I was interested in trying.
The staff were very nice. It's chill & laid back
Bar service."
87,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great selection of beers, including their own delicious 'Precious IPA'"
88,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of those bars that you must visit if you love beer. They make an incredible effort to get kegs of beer from breweries you would not expect.
89,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I went to Gollem expecting a lovely dinner with my girlfriend and decided to choose the Spring chicken with potatoes,when it finally came out to the table I tucked in, but to my amazement there was hardly any chicken on it. I decided to ‚Ä¶"
90,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good selection of beer, staff knowledgeable. Decent chips but are cooked on beef fat but ribs were a real let down, very chewy."

92,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I loved the array of beer served here, very antique looking decor. But wish there was more variety of food available."
93,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Lots of choice for beers and a nice and cosy venue with outside seating when the weather allows it. Unfortunately the toilet is down the stairs so not wheelchair accessible.
94,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Of all the Gollems this is one of them. It's good. It's good. Much better than a place with pictures of beer if beer on a plastic menu. But if you want the best Gollem, go to the one by the Amstel. Or better, to Foeders in De Pijp."
95,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place for a chilled out beer with friends away from the hustle and bustle of city life and the tourist trap. Late 20s to 40s clientele, really cool for a late night sipper"
96,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Can be really busy,  sometimes to busy, but this is part of their success. Endless variety of beers , also the food can be quite good. Be aware that it can be a bit pricey though."
97,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,5 years ago,So many delicious beer options! The staff were incredibly helpful as well! They gave me a full tour of all of the sours that they had. All of them were delicious!

102,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Friendly staff, great beers. Won't show potential customers the door if the space is there, but if it's full, you're SOL."
103,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great selection of beer and food. Nice people working there. One of the best place in the Oud West
104,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Beer bars and Amsterdam go hand in hand like college students and sexually transmittable diseases. The reason this particular joint stands out, is because it is located just outside the touristy Leidsche Plein and it has a particular good ‚Ä¶"
105,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great bar with a big selection of bottled and tap beers, including local and a lot of Belgian beers. Lots of tasty bar snack food too."

108,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Great place but service was terrible- the waiters are unforgiving and impolite and I felt unwelcome. Will probably not return unless service improves ‚Ä¶
109,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing little place. We sat outside and had a few beers. They had knowledgeable staff and there is a drink here for everyone.
110,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 1 star ,6 years ago,"We sat down, and flagged down one of the waiters.  He walked up to us and said, ""you know it isn't polite to wave at people.""  Having lived in the Netherlands for 3 years, I find this statement completely ridiculous.  When I responded that ‚Ä¶"
111,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best collection of beers in the city. Lately very touristy but luckily still a good amount of locals so not too bad!
112,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love this bar. Very friendly staff, amazing beer selection, nice snacks. Easily in 5 star territory."

119,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Gollem's is the best.  Friendly staff,  great beer selection.  Can get crowded.  Would make a reservation.  Try the Flemmish Stew! It's amazing."

121,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place. Huge beer selektion and Great food, the prices Are okay and the staff was very kind"
122,Gollem's Proeflokaal, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Beer selection is wide but very traditional - too much for my taste. Ribs were really dry.
