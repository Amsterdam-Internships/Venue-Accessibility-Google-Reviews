0,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is heavenly. My husband and I make it to Amsterdam atleast once a year and we always come here to stock up. The bottles and overall quality is just impeccable.   Can't wait until you start shipping!!!! ♥️♥️♥️
1,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic selection of Genever, friendly bartender willing to help me try out some new drinks. Feels like a nice neighborhood bar."
2,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really nice place. The barman is very welcoming and takes his time to explain all there is to know about dutch alcohol. The choice on the menu is huge and the place is so nice.
3,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Classic old school pub serving genever & amstel. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Local pub for local people but v receptive of the tourist. V good prices too for Amsterdam
4,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice little pub, staff were very friendly always smiling and extremely helpful when helping me choose a Dutch Gin. I recommend trying the korenwijn zuidam."
5,In de Olofspoort, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Old school bar. Unique and autentic decoration. Not for everyone.
6,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Changed ownership about 2 months ago, but new owners and staff are very welcoming and have kept most of the old decor and still specialize in jenever and liqueurs. Lovely place and one of my favorites in Amsterdam."
7,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"An oasis of quiet, old-world charm and Dutch Whisky (more like whisky than gin!!), the ""old man / local pub"" that seems impossible to find amongst the tourist traps, but it is there. Anyone serving you will be highly knowledgeable and warm. …"
8,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Intimate, old-time bar that specializes in Dutch genever (gin). The bartender is extremely knowledgeable and friendly and will help you choose some of the different liquor or beer options they have on tap. This bar is a bit of an oddity in …"
9,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the most special and quintessential places in Amsterdam. So happy to have wandered upon it ! A gem in a neighborhood that has changed around it; continues to serve mainly Dutch patrons. Cozy, old, authentic, excellent home small batch jenevere. I enjoy the 3 year (tastes like whiskey) lovely staff."
10,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A charming, old traditional Dutch bar that serves many varieties of Jenever and tons of Dutch liqueur options. Absolutely loved the place and bartender is really sweet who helped us with the different options. We even bought some Jenever and apple cinnamon liqueur."
11,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Totally loved it.  Vanilla or cinnamon liquer on a cold day in Amsterdam really warms you up.  This place feels like you've stepped back in time.  Highly recommend.  Very friendly staff and other clientele too.
12,In de Olofspoort, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely selection of Gins served by a nice young lady. Loses 3 stars because of the attitude of the miserable old woman who runs the place. Absolutely rude & arrogant old cow!!!! She was doing a tasting in another room and came into the bar …
13,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I love this place. It is a place where you can have a great gin (Dutch: jenever) and have a conversation with friends or family without music as background. This is a very old place to taste many, many different jenevers and other funny named drinks."
14,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This is a very nice place with a great selection of interesting drinks.  The barman was friendly and very helpful even if like me you know very little about the drinks on offer.  There really is a huge selection.  You will enjoy it here.
15,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Exceptional. Wonderful cosy, characterful venue with comfortable surroundings and lots to look at. Kind, helpful service remarkable for quite a busy, touristic area. In all ways a pub as well as a jenever tasting room, with no regard given for choice of drink partaken. A must visit and a special place."
16,In de Olofspoort, 2 stars ,5 years ago,We came here at 5pm today at a friend's suggestion (when we were the only patrons) and had a drink. They said the singing didn't start till 8 so we went for dinner and came back. I guess they didn't like the fact that we had our kid with us …
17,In de Olofspoort, 4 stars ,5 years ago,One of the oldest pubs in Amsterdam.. 70 jenever to try but also serve beer. The barman is terrific and the clients are always friendly.
18,In de Olofspoort, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very nice, informal, typical Amsterdam atmosphere -- bring plenty of 'kapsones'. Incredible selection of Dutch gins/jenevers, served by a knowledgeable host."
19,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An incredible old Genever Bar, with huge selection of vintage spirits. Do your self a favour and order the Bols Korenwijn 10yo with a beer chaser. You're welcome."
20,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,5 years ago,We stopped in by random chance and had a great time.  The sweet man behind the bar explained all the liquor and was so welcoming!  Highly recommend a stop in for a drink!
21,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,4 years ago,It's like going back in time when you enter the bar. Great beer selection and homemade (down in the basement) liqors. Staff is very friendly.
22,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"If you fancy gin or limoncello, jenever might also be your cup of tea. The friendly owner and his staff are happy to give a personal recommendation based on your taste."
23,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,11 years ago,"Very friendly locals, excellent selection of really high quality jenevers. My favourite bar from a rapid tour of 8ish on a Saturday afternoon in Amsterdam."
24,In de Olofspoort, 5 stars ,4 years ago,very good drink and atmosphere.
