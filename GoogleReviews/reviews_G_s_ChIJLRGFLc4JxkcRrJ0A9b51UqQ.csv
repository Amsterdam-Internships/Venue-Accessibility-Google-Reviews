0,G's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious!! It’s a small place but the hostess does a great job keeping track of who is waiting and offered to bring a drink while we were waiting. The cocktails all sounded delicious. The bloody Mary’s we tried were both good and spicy. …
1,G's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very relaxed and quaint atmosphere. We had breakfast. Eggs and Toast, French Toast and coffee. Tasted every bit as good as back in Canada. A rare find in Europe, they actually keep a bottle of real Heinz ketchup and a bottle of HP sauce on …"
2,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely brunch experience. Reservations are strongly recommended but there are also always spots available for walk ins like us. We were there at 10am on a Saturday morning and still could fit in. According to a waitress it gets super busy …
3,G's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Yummy !!! Very tasty ! The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cool and friendly !!!
It was difficult to choose ! Lot of choices and everything seems so good ! A very good address for a brunch."
4,G's, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Meh. I was super excited about the menu. The have a ton of Bloody Mary options; my favourite! The menu is super customizable and the best part is the option to order a small pancake/waffle or French toast. But execution is really bad. …
5,G's, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The atmosphere of the place was alright. I liked their coffee, but the actual breakfast for me was a little disappointing. The eggs were cooked carelessly and the beans and mushrooms came cold. My partner enjoyed the eggs Benedict but he …"
6,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic food. A really good place indeed.
7,G's, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice little Brunch easy cool typical Jordaan bistrot.
The food is tasty, easy and well priced.
Very nice and friendly staff."
8,G's, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We had a great time and meal at the Gs, they serve delicious waffles and their breads are nice as well. Due to the popularity, it is wise to reserve in advance. We couldn't one day prior, so best to reserve 3 days or something in advance if …"
9,G's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly staff but serving could be slow. Cozy small restaurant so better reserve in advance.
10,G's, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It is a small place, however it has cozy atmosphere. Since it was so busy Sunday afternoon, my dish came cold and I didnt make a complain about it.
The taste was OK, but I had the best ones before.
The staff is friendly and coctails are tastey."
11,G's, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very hipster place. I loved their Eggs Philly. Great decor, ambience and nice music."
12,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"As a New Yorker - I’ve been to more “trendy” brunches than I can count, and this place really impressed me. First, they take a really fun tone with everything from the comic book table cloths to the descriptions in the menu. The Bloody Mary selection is massive and they run really creative takes on eggs benedict. This place is a must."
13,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good food! The menu is very varied and you can basically make your dream breakfast with all the options. My only complaint is that it is a bit expensive.
14,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A small cafe in a quiet side street of Jordaan. Popular and busy, so come with patience and a relaxing mood.
Excellent staff and one of the best tasting coffee in Amsterdam. …"
15,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"YUM brunch, with a CRAZY menu of bloody Mary’s.

20,G's, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This place is perfect! Chill atmosphere, great decor, and super nice staff. The food is delicious, really diverse, and reasonably priced. I had the bacon Benedict, which as delicious, but I think the vegan sandwiches are most popular. I will be back again!"

25,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Small and cosy. This brunch will keep us coming for more. Fresh and delicious food and great service
26,G's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent brunch spot. Benny eggs were borderline boiled too hard, but overall, a lovely spot to eat."
27,G's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great brunch spot with a torturiously delicious menu - wanted everything but ended up picking the Dirty South -cheddar waffles, bacon and fried chicken. All washed down with a classic bloody Mary. Gorge. Vibe is lovely too. Perfect place to start the day."
28,G's, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I would say it is 3,5 but I rounded it up to 4. On the positive side: besides some classics (like eggs Benedict, club sandwiches etc) they serve savory waffles with either chicken or salmon and the batter for the waffle is great. The …"
29,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The in da club sandwich was delicious as was the chicken burger waffle sandwich! Highly recommend!

31,G's, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic cozy place in de Jordaan, Amsterdam for a good brunch!"
32,G's, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"These guys don’t know how to make poached eggs the proper way which is actually remarkable since usually if the place can’t do the eggs right, they don’t offer a separate egg-based menu. The eggs were overcooked which came as a surprise …"
33,G's, 5 stars ,a year ago,Lovely bloody marys and delicious food and coffee! Really cosy.
34,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The quesadilla is fantastic. Fried chicken is on point too.

I don't see what the big deal is based on the chicken and waffles I got. I think …"
36,G's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The French Toast here is really good. I also really like the coffee. But the French toast keeps me coming back to this breakfast spot. There’s so many great looking things on the menu - hopefully one day I’ll try them instead of always …
37,G's, 1 star ,2 years ago,"After reading the positive reviews, I was expecting great eggs benedict. Unfortunately it wasn't good at all. The amount of hollandaise sauce looked really sad. And it made me sad as well. (Why so frugal? Are you running out of eggs and …"
38,G's, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"You can drink Bloody Mary in the morning! Even it's not really my type of drink, but it's a great experience dining there ;)"
39,G's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great small place. The food is good and in good size. Good for brunch.
40,G's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A lovely, cosy, little place.  Very friendly and welcoming.  Quite a long wait for the food but it was well worth the wait.   Just sheer volume of people that slows it down.  But highly recommended if you are not in a hurry."
41,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Probably one of the best breakfast/brunch places I have been to in a while. The staff, despite being constantly busy, are incredibly friendly and just great. The food is absolutely delicious and well prices as are the coffees and cocktails. …"
42,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favorite lunch / brunch places. The menu is extensive, and everybody can find something to their liking. The booze is also nice! The only downside is it is quite a small place so it's a bit squuezed. reservation definitely required!"
43,G's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Gs was lovely! Very trendy and cozy feeling with American kitsch comfort food and surroundings. Perfect if you like hipster brunch, felt like Brooklyn. Menus are on vinyls and tablecloths are 1950s style. Our waitress was extremely friendly, humoring us by asking lots of questions about our life in America. Great bloody Mary’s."
44,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I'm a breakfast person and have eaten a lot of breakfasts but this breakfast was probably the best breakfast of all the breakfasts. Such an interesting menu, a really nice change from your average brunch place. If I'm ever in Amsterdam again I'll be heading here every morning."
45,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food and friendly service! We ordered a “Benny New York” which was delicious, as well as the “notorious BLT”, also very good. Big portions and high quality food for the price. It was quite busy so a reservation wouldn’t hurt. Would definitely go back!"
46,G's, 1 star ,3 years ago,"My experience started out wonderfully and ended terribly.  I was incredibly excited by the abundant Bloody Mary menu and loved the taste when my Bloody Mary quickly arrived.  After ordering the ""brunch dip on crack"" as a starter, we waited …"
47,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food here is great! I recommend the crack breakfast dip- you won’t be disappointed. The restaurant itself is very small so I wouldn’t show up without reservations (or else you might be waiting a while).
48,G's, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Poached eggs were too hard, got a small drip of hollaindaise, and the spinach wasn’t really creamy and tasty. Put that on a boring piece of bread and you get a lousy attempt at eggs Benedict. Maybe try to give your food attention that it needs, before giving it to your customers?"
49,G's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome place. Great breakfast. Bloody Mary’s are insanely good. Super cosy spot. Could easily have whiled away the entire afternoon there drinking my way through their Bloody Mary menu. Will definitely be back.
50,G's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Bright, open, excellent food and cocktails"
51,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So good we went twice in our three day trip to Amsterdam. Gorgeous, cosy little space. Very friendly staff, great coffee and the food is outstanding. Highly recommend. Be sure to reserve a table at the weekend."

56,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent brunch! I highly recommend trying their website, as it's a popular place - for a reason! 12 varieties of bloody Mary's are available (even a caesar for canadians)
Staff was very nice."
57,G's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I didn’t try their coffee but food was delish!!!!! And nice atmosphere. Though I would change the towels in the bathroom to individual ones, I hate rubbing my hands off an already wet towel that was used by someone else"
58,G's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love this place! Food was fantastic, drinks were amazing, and the service was even better. Make a reservation."
59,G's, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere. Staff were very nice as always. However the food was not that good, cold and in small portions. Seems like it’s going down in quality 😕"

69,G's, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Never even got to taste the food. The staff were so rude, they practically threw us out the restaurant and later decided to give us free drinks for there bad service. Too little, too late. Here's your bad review!"
70,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious. Friendly staff and fun music. Highly recommend. Have drink or two!
71,G's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A bit tight but the food was amazing and their menu is just awesome. Worth the wait.
72,G's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is absolutely delicious, with the best orange juice and american type of brunch.
The only thing is, as a tourist, I would recommend a meal with a better location, somewhere around the canal. This location is rather hidden, with not much of a view."
73,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"WOW!!! 😮

Great food! Great service! Great mimosas! 😊 …"
74,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Must try !!! Had to wait as the place was packed.  But honestly worth the wait . The food is yummy 😍

76,G's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place for brunch, but also very popular. Good to get a reservation."
77,G's, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"So disappointed! This place used to be awesome but today, it was far from it. The staff were lovely as always but the food and drink have gone downhill. Bloody Marys are made in batch and tasted off. Sad that it's not as good as it used to be 🙁"
78,G's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best brunch in town. Although their other items are great, go for the eggs benedicts."
79,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great local spot that makes authentic American brunch. Everything here is good.

80,G's, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I've been a bit disappointed by the food... The poached egg, was way too much cook and tasted a bit too much vinegar... It is also kind of expensive for the quantity they serve. …"
81,G's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The brunch is great, I’ve tried eggs with fried chicken, the Benedict, as well as the guacamole appetizer. My only disappointment is the coffee, it’s a bit weak and watery, was expecting better, and think the brunch is a bit overpriced. I do highly recommend trying the brunch regardless 🙂"
82,G's, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great little place for brunch, would recommend booking as it's very small. People were queing outside for a table but the staff were taking coffee out to them which was nice. Very slow service however the food was worth it, however don't go …"

85,G's, 5 stars ,5 years ago,One of my favorite brunch places. Do try to book a day or two ahead though - it's cosy and quickly gets full.

89,G's, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place. Slow service on Saturday. All my friends had wonderful dishes, I regret the Habibi. Order something with poached eggs for sure. Amazing mimosa with fresh juice!"
90,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great experience. I definitely recommend this place:) Gs is a hidden gem in the middle of Jordan. We loved it!!!
91,G's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It has an amazing Bloody Mary's menu, the food is great and the place itself is all music themed and it looks cool. Plus, it's not very touristy so it feels more relaxed."
92,G's, 1 star ,2 years ago,The most arrogant staff who don't communicate at all. Not friendly and we didn't feel welcome. Got such a bad vibe while waiting that we went off and didn't taste the food

94,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, amazing cocktails and super cozy. The real Amsterdam brunch!"

96,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best brunch I've ever had
97,G's, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is alright, nothing to write home about. They have no sugar free option for drinks, so my diabetic father had no other option that only have tap water. Good service though."

99,G's, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Great food, chill atmosphere, welcoming staff! Would definitely come back here on my next trip to Amsterdam."

103,G's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Bonkers amazingly good. Amazing Bloody Mary selection... and there were 11 of us who all ordered breakfast and we all loved our meals.
104,G's, 1 star ,2 years ago,Waited over 45 minutes never got our food and didn't tell us what was wrong until we asked.  Poor customer service
105,G's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wow, all of my dreams have come true having found a place in Amsterdam that serves chicken & waffles. Thanks, Gs!"
106,G's, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The best of this place is the atmosphere. We were here for lunch and had gin tonic, a chicken hamburger and a biff hamburger. The gin tonic was not worth and the hamburgers was just ok, but nothing special."
107,G's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great breakfast options.  Hip hop/pop music for casual dining.  Loved poached eggs over sauteed spinach.
108,G's, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was good, chicken and waffles were the best between the 2 dishes my husband and I had.  But the service is truly bad - took ages to get our food and drinks.  Kept ordering drinks and they would forget about them.  Unfortunate for such a cute place that plays great hip hop."
109,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome breakfast food. Keto friendly items.

111,G's, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice place, bit small and hence crowded though. Had to sit at the door which kept being opened so that was unpleasantly cold."
112,G's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very crowded and loud. The food is pretty good, but not special."

116,G's, 2 stars ,3 years ago,After waiting 40 minutes to sit down we were very excited to eat. The food came cold. My boyfriends poached was basically a boiled egg. The food was not special or worth the wait.
117,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cannot recommend enough, the fried chicken and waffles were great and the staff made us feel at home ☺️ thank you!"

125,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"All day brunch with excellent North American style brunch dishes, from cheddar waffles to challah bread french toast. They've even got poutine! Lovely little place with a cost homey feel in one of the loveliest off the beaten tourist track of the Jordaan."
126,G's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Bloody Marys and Benedicts are on point!! Its a super small cafe which you might sit with strangers but it was fun bc we met 2 really cool guys from London! The decor inside is dope.

128,G's, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Ok food, the staff is nice but so slow!"
129,G's, 2 stars ,5 years ago,This place was great the first few times I went but seems to be going downhill. We waited ages out in the cold today while customers in the window were left to drink post-meal free tap water at leisure. When we finally got in and ordered we …
130,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Gs is housed in a cozy space, houseplants and ambient chandeliers adawn the space. In a quieter neighbourhood in Amsterdam. Tucked away in the smaller streets, G's is somewhat of a hidden treasure. The music adds a youthful and friendly …"

135,G's, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Usually busy for during breakfast and early afternoon, book in advance. Their specialty is Bloody M cocktails. Food is so-so."

137,G's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food, a twist on most regular dishes"
138,G's, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Maybe I'm being a tad harsh with 3 stars. It was just there was an air of ""Emporers new clothes"".  Let me explain.  My daughter said she'd been trying to get in fpr several weeks.  When we went it was busy and we had to stand outside to …"
139,G's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best brunch place when it comes to eggs benedict with a selection of +15 bloody mary. Highly recommend the Caesar mary, with its spicy clam juice, hard to beat. Definitely book a table at least one week to 2 days in advance. Kitchen closes at 4 in the weekends."

145,G's, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The fried chicken here is what it’s know for but I wouldn’t say it’s amazing it stand-out, prices are decent and it’s a cute venue but not stand out."
146,G's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,one word: POUTINE. As a Canadian I miss this every day. Cheese wasn’t authentic tho :p
147,G's, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Good but not great. Little expensive and no real healthy options.

154,G's, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Dirty glassware, food was not great (not as described),  slow but polite service... But the servers were gossiping about the customers? Also: my Russian friend was offended by the anti-russia comments on the back of the daily special"
155,G's, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"How can a brunch place run out of eggs, chicken and orange juice all at the same time. While the supermarket is around the corner. Avg waiting time for food is 1h, which is ok if you are having drinks before."
156,G's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great brunch, stunning Bloody Mary and amazing music!!"
157,G's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A bang up joint - the ideal spot to head for a Bloody Mary come Sunday morning. With no shortage of satisfying egg-oriented dishes, the only worry is getting a table."
