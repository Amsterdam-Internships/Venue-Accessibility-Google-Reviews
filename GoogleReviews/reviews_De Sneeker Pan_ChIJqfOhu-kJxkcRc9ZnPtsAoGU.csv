0,De Sneeker Pan, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I stop in here often when arriving early from the US before my hotel room is open. I usually start with a cup of coffee, then toast and eggs. It is very quiet and comforting. Staff is very friendly and patient."
1,De Sneeker Pan, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"We went there to have breakfast almost every day of our Amsterdam holidays. The breakfasts are worth their money. Hearty scrambled eggs and great croissants.
