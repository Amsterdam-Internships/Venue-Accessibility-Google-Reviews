29,Irish Pub Slainte, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was genuine and friendly, but the beer prices are very high. ‚Ç¨6.50 for a pint of Guinness is far from worth it. Go during happy hour for sure."
30,Irish Pub Slainte, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"An Irish pub with an international flair. Cold Guinness on tap, with loads of cocktails jug specials and a full range at the bar.

40,Irish Pub Slainte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Irish pub open for breakfast.

41,Irish Pub Slainte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Ate breakfast here on the 28/06/2019. Service was fantastic. The Scottish bar lady welcomed me in and went far and beyond the call of duty to accommodate my brothers needs who was in a wheelchair even saving him a very stressful trip down ‚Ä¶

44,Irish Pub Slainte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great breakfast nice staff been twice
45,Irish Pub Slainte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent pub in the heart of Amsterdam and the Red lights. Large pub with excellent choice of drinks. Happy hour everyday and specials on drinks including cocktails and shorts. Couple of good sized TVs for if there‚Äôs a match on and plenty of seating.
46,Irish Pub Slainte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Whenever i'm in Amsterdam this is always one of my go to haunts! Packs an incredible atmosphere, friendly staff, and a lovely selection of drinks for when you get bored of the repetitive nature of Heineken or Amstel. They also do some amazing food.
