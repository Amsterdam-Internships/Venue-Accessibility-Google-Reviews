0,Bolenius, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Very good restaurant serving dishes from their own vegetable garden. Wine pairings are good and also include some Dutch wines. We had both vegetarian and the normal menu. It is interesting to see what they are able to do without using any fish/meat in a dish.
1,Bolenius, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Worst experience we had in a Michelin star restaurant so far. Unexperienced waiters, no sense menu… ( we have been in meny * and worked as a chefs in meny of them as well…) …"
2,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Love this restaurant. We always buy the box that they sell in Christmas and we really enjoy it (it is becoming a tradition after two years of lockdown). The ingredients are incredibly fresh and the flavors are amazing. Really a must if you are in Amsterdam.
3,Bolenius, 2 stars ,a month ago,"We have been quite disappointed. The food does not provide any surprises, sometimes really bland. A course was not great at all with no balance in the tastes (did not even eat half of it). The wine is a real issue with the cart indicating …"
4,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We went the night before their August vacation started. Fixed course with wine pairings. The food was excellent with good serving appearance as you would expect from a Michelin *. They were absolutely all about Dutch cuisine, so they are …"
5,Bolenius, 3 stars ,3 years ago,My sister is vegetarian and we were hungry I thought to give this restaurant another try. This time I came with the knowledge that it will be a vegetable-focused meal. …
6,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This restaurant was an over-the-top gastronomic WOW!! The serving dishes even had their own artistic presentation. This definitely brought dining to a new level.
7,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful presentation and creative dishes. Vegetables are a highlight and the care given to each ingredient is amazing. The overall experience is really good and worth the price tag.
8,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very creative and wonderful dishes with all fresh ingredients from the garden next to the restaurant. Well deserved a star restaurant.
9,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Super nice and sophisticated food, beautiful and comfortable place ;)"
10,Bolenius, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic lunch here with great vegetables from the garden, friendly service, and wine selection. Definitely worthy of a Michelin star."
11,Bolenius, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Food presentation was impressive, the colour, arrangement, texture, the wide selection of vegetables used to create their dishes from their very own garden around the corner. Quite novel. Portions were small, on the expensive side, quite bland."
12,Bolenius, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It is a bit expensive for a foreigner, but the taste was amazing. Check out the 5 course menu in the photos attached."
13,Bolenius, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Urban gardening restaurant in Amsterdam- highly recommended - top service and food - lunchmenue.
14,Bolenius, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Incredible cuisine, impeccable service. Vegetables as good as they get. I can still almost taste some of the flavours."
15,Bolenius, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"the most expensive vegetables on earth

16,Bolenius, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there for a business lunch. It does not deserve a note so high. Place is well decorated, Service is very good and quick ( compared to many restaurants in Amsterdam). However food is really tasteless. I understand that it is all about …"
17,Bolenius, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Thank you to Luc and his team for an outstanding lunch and experience at Bolenius.
18,Bolenius, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Crystal cruise experience.  Entire experience was mediocre. Owner was nice and professional and friendly. The entire price tag from the ship was outrageous and the food was not to my liking. I just can't get excited about pickled carrots or …
19,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We went for a quick lunch last week, as close to our office and planned a quick reservation given very seasoned colleague's recommendations. And boy, it just delighted us to the core... fresh, organic veggies drinkin their own garden were …"
20,Bolenius, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Dining doesn't get much better. Great and complex flavors, top notch presentation and wine pairings that are original in choice. The very efficient and friendly service takes all of that to an even higher level. …"
21,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was amazing, every dish blew my mind. The service definitly matches that. Like a well choreographed dance but always open to change if you have some special request."
22,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super Nice, great food and superb service"
23,Bolenius, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"High level cuisine, great service and nice selection of wines. Be aware that the 7 course meal might seem doable because of the small portions but it requires a robust appetite."
24,Bolenius, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Excellent restaurant offering a nicely creative menu based on premium products. We've tried the 5 courses tasting menu - a great experience with roasted langoustines and homegrown vegetables. Highly recommended if you happen to be in this eccentric part of the city.
25,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely fantastic experience. The food was great in taste and presentation. The staff is knowledgeable about their dishes and drinks and the overall feeling is truly luxureous.
26,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Hidden gem in the middle of the financial district. Both presentation and food quality to a high standard. Ambiance is private so you Can have a good business conversation  during lunch.
27,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Bolenius serves modern Dutch food. Modern <European country> often just means fine dining with no discernable difference. But there is something particularly Dutch about bolenius. Distinctive, strong, possibly blunt flavors that combine harmoniously. Subtle use of spice. It was surprisingly good and surprisingly exciting."
28,Bolenius, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect place for a business lunch. Super healthy options. Fresh produce from their own garden. Great wines. Modern, white interior. Friendly Dutch speaking staff."
29,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Can't wait to return.
30,Bolenius, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Innovative place with great healthy dishes. Many of the ingredients proceed from their garden and all ingredients are sourced locally. Recommend to go all the way through the menu including desserts.
31,Bolenius, 1 star ,3 years ago,My wife and I dined at Bolenius tonight - we were so disappointed that we left after 5 of the 7 courses of the tasting menu. Things started well enough with amuse bouche and the first course from the kitchen garden - but then things …
32,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome, creative experience - and of course good food"
33,Bolenius, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super restaurant using the art of mixing different ingredients to the best. A paradise for those with an adventurous palate. Excellent service.
34,Bolenius, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow, the food was excellent, each course well paced so we were never left waiting too long, but long enough that each could stand on its own merits. Service was beyond reproach, I will definitely be going back for more."
35,Bolenius, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Interesting and while sometimes a bit overly conceptual. Food is good. Service is impeccable. Certainly the best option in that neighborhood
36,Bolenius, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Deserve Top Restaurante award. Excellent service and menu. I recommend for those who want experience to remember.
37,Bolenius, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very special way of representing Dutch cuisine. Everything was just perfect. The presentation, service and food."

40,Bolenius, 1 star ,5 years ago,Did not like it at all. Overly complicated flavours. A small conflict about the check could have been resolved amicably but clumsy patron turned it into a pr disaster.
