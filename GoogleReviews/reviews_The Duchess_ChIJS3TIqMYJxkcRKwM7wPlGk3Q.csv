3,The Duchess, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very cool experience! That's the first Michelin restaurant I tried in Amsterdam and my expectations have been met. I would highly suggest the Wellington (a best-seller here), the Tuna Tartare and the Tagliolini with Pesto, Pistacchi and …"

6,The Duchess, 1 star ,a year ago,"When you go for a High Tea Afternoon with expectations of an experience and you get awful food, bad service and you never want to get back.

The building is beautiful and they have an open kitchen.  Would definitely go back as we would like to have dinner next time. We had a whole explanation for the cocktails, and how they were made, and Isabelle was an amazing host!"
11,The Duchess, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is my Go To place for afternoon tea with girl friends! On my last visit, we had a delicious array of bite-sized treats, with the savory snacks departing from the traditional sandwiches. The dessert was fantastic, though by then we were …"
12,The Duchess, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you are looking for a luxurious afternoon tea, this is the place to go to. Right in the heart of Amsterdam, the building is beautiful inside and the staff is wonderful and knowledgeable. Pick the spot next to the kitchen, the big glass window gives you a direct view of where the magic happens."
13,The Duchess, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Unfortunately the high tea was disappointing and there are some reasons for this. First of all, I think the way it’s presented on your social media is misleading. Colorful teapot and cups, a way more vibrant set up than the simple, somewhat …"

The overall feeling when we left was super negstive though. …"

16,The Duchess, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Absolutely delicious food, beautiful restaurant and attentive professional staff. We had the rösti , asparagus and short ribs and they were absolutely fantastic!"
17,The Duchess, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Good food and good service. The balance of flavours with some dishes needs to be improved. Really disliked the dessert and was a bit overrated if being honest. The seafood spaghetti tastes too much of smoke. Felt like coughing half the times. Nothing too special with the dishes. However the scallop was perfection
18,The Duchess, 4 stars ,3 years ago,One of the fancier restaurants I’ve experienced in Amsterdam. We had a group of 8 and only option was a pre fix menu around €80. The chefs table experience was worth it and left completely stuffed and satisfied. Would have preferred to pick …

20,The Duchess, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Beautiful restaurant and very kind staff. I must admit that the food was very nice but nothing mind blowing. The cocktails didn't live up to my expectations…. Could be better!
21,The Duchess, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Been coming here for a while and I have to say the quality of the food use to be better, still I like the place and I hope they’ll have the full menu back soon!"
22,The Duchess, 4 stars ,3 years ago,All dishes are meant to be shared and they are served when they are ready from the kitchen so it would be a bit inconvenient if you have not finished the starter dishes. This way of serving is like eating in a Chinese restaurant. Background music is a bit loud but very hip. Waiters are very attentive. Food is delicious.
23,The Duchess, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"I went there for early dinner at 6 pm. The staff was friendly and hospitable; despite the fact I came early, they let me in to sit at the bar. For the appetizer, I had the Tomato Carpaccio with Watermelon & Lemon Thyme Oil, which has a …"
24,The Duchess, 4 stars ,11 months ago,"We had an Afternoon Tea when it first opened during the pandemic. Expected more but it was just too hyped up and the food served felt average. Also, the bathroom was pretty dirty and toilet papers laying on the ground. Overall, the service was good and staff was friendly."
25,The Duchess, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been to my fair share of fancy restaurants. When it's worth it, I don't mind spending on good food. In this case - we overpaid. It's a fancy place, which is fine, but almost every dish we tried was an ""almost"" case. Close to …"
26,The Duchess, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Best restaurant in town!

33,The Duchess, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful location and delicious food. Downsides: we asked for some water, and didn't get it. Asked again 10 mins later, and they apologised for forgetting. They forgot again, we had to ask again. Took about 30 mins from first asking, to …"
34,The Duchess, 1 star ,3 years ago,Birthday boy was denied in every way we asked. We wanted to get a chocolate explosion dessert that the front desk lady sold us on. Then she said we couldn't get a table because they were packed (they weren't) so she offered the bar. Totally …
35,The Duchess, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I like the atmosphere, decorative and surroundings. It was almost perfect but some dishes that meant to serve warm were a bit cold. Still chocolate explosion makes me happy."

44,The Duchess, 1 star ,2 years ago,I was uderwelmed with the whole high tea experience. I don't understand when you need to call to make a reservation you're asked to send an email. Then you have to choose what menu you'd like to have. As if there is no time to lose. I'd …

47,The Duchess, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great place, great service, great food, great drinks. Love it, will come again."
48,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Yet another amazing afternoon tea. This place can hold its own even against some best tea rooms of London. Spending a little more for the Royal tea does pay off. Now you also can choose between tea pairings, when they choose the correct tea for you, or just picking your own tea, like you did before. Quality of the food is amazing."
49,The Duchess, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing landmark venue, with food to match.  Ate here a couple of times before Christmas and also spent new years eve here.  The decor is exceptional, and the service impeccable.  For main course the beef wellington was memorable as was the …"

51,The Duchess, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Extremely highly priced as oer the food quality. The food was good but doesnt live up to the prices. The olace is gorgeous and is full of socialites. Dress to impress people! Ambience is great and the dessert creme brulee was out of the world.

53,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I went to The Duchess during the Kings Day Weekend with some friends for the first time and I was very impressed with the amazing Food, Drinks and Service.

54,The Duchess, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, but would've expected staff to be a bit more professional. We were serviced by 4 different waiters who seemed clueless about their own drinks, menus and selection of sweets. Although the place was almost empty, we were …"

60,The Duchess, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"High tea @the duchess. The only thing that was really nice was interior. Tea was also lovely. However, when you pay 50eur for the high tea you expect that at least the cups and plates were not worn out. A bummer. But the food was also …"
61,The Duchess, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good restaurant. Everything is nicely prepared. The place itself is marvellous.
62,The Duchess, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Unbelievably good food. Seriously some of the best I have ever had. Our waiter, Davis, was extremely polite and helpful. Recommended a cocktail for my fiancée and he was spot on, she loved it. The duck was our favorite. The blood and stone …"

70,The Duchess, 1 star ,a year ago,We made a reservation at 9:15PM for 4 people and had to wait 1hr to be seated. In the meantime we had to ask for an update about our table several times. No pro-activity from their side. As if they did not care or perhaps we were not …

81,The Duchess, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Enjoyed the high tea with an awesome service and delicious bites/snacks
82,The Duchess, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We had the chefs surprise. I have to say the food was really good... Only the chocolate bomb desert a bit of a waste as we weren't hungry any more and it was huge for 2 people. So after 3 tiny bites we let them take it away. But the venue …
83,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Spectacular.  Absolutely lovely.  I came in and sat at the bar for drinks and desserts.  I wish that I hadn't eaten dinner already because I would have loved to have eaten more.  I can definitely see how and why this place was awarded a …
84,The Duchess, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"At dinner here, some dishes were amazing like the chocolate explosion dessert and others were not as good as I hoped. Still a great meal and good service. For a Michelin stared restaurant I wanted the beef Wellington to be better and well …"
85,The Duchess, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty blah food and mediocre service. None of it was particularly fresh. Avocado salad was definitely prepared earlier as the avocados were brown and lobster was overcooked and chilled with several bits of shell. …
86,The Duchess, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The food is excellent, the service is great and the place really cool."
87,The Duchess, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely selection of excellent food in the most beautiful venue. Great wine menu too. My only complaint however is the poor service, forgetting our orders and not understanding a couple of requests. Would easily be 5 stars with improvements in this area!"
88,The Duchess, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been to the Duchess with a 3 other friends, and we ordered almost 10 different plates / meals. I was surprised when my friends told me that the tastiest food they ate was the bread. Well, that will give you an idea that the quality …"

92,The Duchess, 1 star ,5 months ago,"If you like this place, you most likely go to applebee’s a lot. Tourist trap"
93,The Duchess, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The building is 10/10 the Service 3/10. They brought our coffee and Tea plain. No honey no Sugar! After asking they brought a little honey in an Egg Holder and the Spoon they just placed it on the table no Napkin nothing... After nobody …

95,The Duchess, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is awesome, we enjoyed the chefs menu which is based on menu items of your choice. The service was sometimes a bit forced (but always correct). Highly recommended. End your dinner with a bang with the chocolate explosion..."
96,The Duchess, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Nice place but... Undeserving of the Michelin star. Makes me doubt the value of Michelin ratings.
97,The Duchess, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Wonderful food with great service presented. The sharing concept works very well and the choices in dishes vary greatly. Only the lighting at the tables could be a bit better. We needed a phone to shine some light on the wonderful menu.
98,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We've been here for both dinner and high tea and truly enjoyed both experiences. The food was just excellent and we tried several amazing dishes that I'd love to go back for. The only downside was that we went on a Sunday evening and it was …

101,The Duchess, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Modern, cosmopolitan setting. Maybe a bit too much as we could not even address waiters in Dutch. The place is quite dark and loud, you sit very close to your neighbor. The design is very nice. Dishes were original but did not impress. And I am afraid this whole sharing-concept is not for me."
102,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,been here for breakfast buffet which is fabulous (and very nice location)
103,The Duchess, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place is really amazing! Right from the start, me and my wife were taken on a special dining trip, an experience we will never forget. The staff is exceptional friendly, well informed about the history of the place and the produce they …"
104,The Duchess, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I personally found the prices not in line with the quality. Also did the waiter not manage to serve food and drinks in the right order or even see when we would need anything else. The shrimps were very basic and thus not worth the price …

109,The Duchess, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Good service, but, as vegetarians, uninspired and bland menu. We allowed the Duchess to serve anything they wanted. The resulting five course dishes were weak, mostly cold vegetables, untreated, and a bland risotto. Nothing remotely …"
110,The Duchess, 1 star ,2 years ago,"A lousy experience. My husband had reserved a table for my birthday. We asked for the tasting menu and they told us that it was not possible to be ordered beforehand. A waitress or from the Argentine kitchen came to speak to us in Spanish, …"

112,The Duchess, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I came here for breakfast since I was staying at W — even thought there were only a few customers (less than 5~6 tables), it took quite long to get seated and place my order. I don’t know whether my server was busier than others or she was …"
113,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice and friendly ‘fine dine’ place.. good choices for vegetarians like me.. the crispy zucchini with truffle is nice. The warm ‘10 mushroom’ side is a delight for mushroom lovers. The wine selection is gorgeous. 🍷
114,The Duchess, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Wasn’t expecting a Michelin Star restaurant to be so below par last night. Very surprised by how carelessly they served us. My wife ordered a Diet Coke which never came. Both of our main courses were too salty that we had to return them. …
115,The Duchess, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I came here with my girlfriend for our anniversary, the venue and location are great, and the food was also super tasty. Although it is more on the expensive side the quality is well worth the price. …"
116,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,5 star food and service. Wonderful.
117,The Duchess, 2 stars ,2 years ago,I think this concept is not for me. Food is served a la minute which means it comes to your table when ready. This is very easy for the kitchen but screws up everything else. Feels very frantic and rushed. No cohesion between dishes. Plates …
118,The Duchess, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"My girlfriend and I were greeted warmly at our arrival and were showed to our table, where our waiter proceeded to explain us the menu and tool our order for drinks. We had crunchy zucchini with truffles, tuna tartare, lobster and king crab …"
119,The Duchess, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Gorgeous setting, wonderful food, cocktails and wine. Somewhat let down by the lack of professionalism of the staff - why would you refresh someone’s water glass by reaching across their plate? For the price, the service should be impeccable."
120,The Duchess, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Well the food was amazing! The service was a disaster... they took them 10-12 minutes to top up my wine (i ask them to give my bottle to me) they didnt inform us about last orders they take the empty plates only when they had to bring the …
121,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had dinner 2 weeks ago and it was Amazing. The food was top notch and the service was impeccable, our host Lidy went far and beyond to accommodate us, she was very patient recommending the right dished for us and for our kids (we are …"

125,The Duchess, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome place with amazing grandeur! Marble everywhere, awesome ceiling, huge chandeliers, as if this restaurant is beamed over from New York... Very un-Dutch. I like hanging at the bar here, to enjoy the cocktails. Staff is very friendly …"

127,The Duchess, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The Duchess was very clean and nice on the inside, except its on the second floor and hard to find. We made our reservation for 6:30 pm, which they told us we only had 2 hours at our table. we arrived 5 minutes early and there were only two …"
128,The Duchess, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Definitely one of the most beautiful restaurants in Amsterdam

133,The Duchess, 5 stars ,4 years ago,What a wonderful evening we had at the Duchess! Me and my boyfriend went to Duchess bar two weeks ago on a Thursday night and couldn't make up my mind on what to order. Our bartender from Italy (I think his name was Lukas) after some good …
134,The Duchess, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Went here for anniversary dinner, reservation made by our hotel.  I know they didn't have tremendous notice, but they sat us at the worst table in the restaurant, between a service station and the kitchen.  The beef wellington was very …"
135,The Duchess, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Nice place ruined by terrible service! Last week my friend and I went to the Duchess for a cup of tea and some cake. We were greeted by a tall blond waiter. I asked if there was a menu and he replied there wasn't with an attitude. Then, …"
136,The Duchess, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Honestly quite disappointed. Paid 85 euros for a beef wellington, starter and drink. Beef Wellington's very dry, the side truffle mashed potato's also very dry, unlike a quality one. The squid of the starter's overcooked. Personally, I wouldn't go again."

142,The Duchess, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"My 3rd visit to the duchess and I feel that it has list a bit of its gleam. The service was poor, tardy, the food was lack lustre and I felt the portion sizes were mean and presentation lacked pizzazz. It seemed that diners were a bit if an …"

145,The Duchess, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there a few times. These were some of the most Amazing cocktails I've ever had. But the personnel wasn't friendly and service always took way too long. It is worth a go, though."
146,The Duchess, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"High tea was sublime, the pianist made the atmosphere even better. Keep in mind it's relatively a lot of food, the tea makes the digestion better, it's still a lot of food. The beignet with foie gras was sublime!"
147,The Duchess, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Delicious! Everything is meant to be shared on the table. The space is beautiful with high ceilings, the food was delightful! Seemed to be a happening place. Would definitely recommend this place. A little on the spendy side, but you get what you pay for!!"
148,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Easily my favourite restaurant in Amsterdam.

Great menu, superb wine list and great service. …"
149,The Duchess, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We went for afternoon tea (the theme was ""gay week afternoon tea""). The food and the tea were generally delicious and the atmosphere and service great. Only the marshmallow and the cupcakes were not so good (but cupcakes are never good)."
150,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food. Great ambiance. Everything we ate was incredible. My wife and I take our eating experiences very seriously and this place did not disappoint at all!
151,The Duchess, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My place in Amsterdam. Super friendly service especially by the receptionist from Sudan/Colombia and the floor manger. Great selection of food with few signature dishes. Simply a must
152,The Duchess, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The dinner here was wonderful: courteous professional service, flavourful dishes. The enterior is fine too. It all was, however, just a bit short of really great. Food needs a twist, service — an extra smile."
153,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The place is great. Escpecially the chefs table. The courses came in good variations and with good diversity. Staff was okay but i had the feeling they were struggling a bit. And the signature dessert is a must
154,The Duchess, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice and fancy with good food. The chocolate dessert is exciting
155,The Duchess, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Overrated for the prices. Staff is great though.
156,The Duchess, 2 stars ,a year ago,Style over substance. Food is OK but overpriced for what it is. Service was severely  lacking other than front of house who were very friendly. Sadly won't be returning here.
157,The Duchess, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We enjoyed. All dishes were shared. Some of the dishes were amazing, espacially chocolate explosen, duck snd beans with foe-gras. Service was excellent. It is a .bit noisy"
158,The Duchess, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Early lunch (1200) near the Clock. Service was gentle, light, accurate. Menu full of delicious surprises (alert: the gnocchi are worthless). And as a finale, the choco explosion was funny (more than really tasty). A casual Michelin in an old Dutch bank. (ADEO / 2017)"
159,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful setting with high ceilings and stylish interiors. Cuisine and service all great. I prefer here over Cecconi which is next door. Cecconi is also good but this one is a bit better, more suitable for a special dinner"
160,The Duchess, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Easily the worst service I've ever had.  When the staff literally rolls their eyes at you and asks, ""Well what do you want?"", then walks away and asks you to confirm, ""So you're asking me to remove the X from your bill because you refuse to …"
161,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We had a lovely experience :) The staff was very attentive and friendly and the food was great. Especially the halibut and the truffle gnocchi. Recommend!
162,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a place, you can't describe.
Must see
The food is delicious, and plating is just simple but incredible.
Thank for stuff, who made our dinner even more magic"
163,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food! We went here for a NYE a la carte dinner and it was outstanding. Especially the aubergine carpaccio and the tuna tartar were amazing dishes. Highly recommended!
164,The Duchess, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Visited this place a couple of times now during lunch and dinner.  The food is good. The restrooms however.. during all my visits not once have I experienced clean restrooms. Quite the scandal.
165,The Duchess, 1 star ,2 years ago,So expensive. A cocktail menu that only offers alcohol. Not a lot of choice at the end. They sit you at the bar in the middle while employees are walking around you. Really annoying. And you pay €15 for a cocktail and don't even get a proper sit... What a waste of time and money.
166,The Duchess, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very friendly staff. Did a special fare for a friends birthday on request. Authentic and delicious food! Sneakers desert was the best!
167,The Duchess, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Nice atmosphere but the food was dissapointing unfortunately and definitely considering their price point. Mr Porter across the street is much better
168,The Duchess, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Good ambiance and nice cocktails ! Definitely cool! Like the name too. Haven't eaten here cannot comment myself but heard the food was not so good.
169,The Duchess, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Everything was excellent!!! The food is delicious, the place is beautiful and the service is perfect. Definitely one of my favourite places in Amsterdam."
170,The Duchess, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely love this place- the high tea is definitely the best in Amsterdam! Th restaurant has a great menu and caters very well for vegetarians.
171,The Duchess, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"As I was sitting in the restaurant, there came a MOUSE/RAT out of nowhere on to the table and then to the floor and it disappeared to somewhere. This is unacceptable for such a high-end restaurant to have MICE in the restaurant. Nevertheless, the food and service are fine."
172,The Duchess, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice food, relaxing low lights, friendly (perhaps a bit too friendly) service, loud and nasty music..."
173,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great high-tea! Great service!
174,The Duchess, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If you'd like to experience orgasm of your taste sensors then this is a place to be! Superb service, brilliant dishes with a little extra present from the chef"
175,The Duchess, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"If you are after a proper upscale experience, well you might get disappointed. The venue is really beautiful but everything else is a wee meh."
176,The Duchess, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Long long looong wait for food. If you wish to eat at around 10pm we suggest you book your table pre 8pm. Food however was excellent. Great presentation.
177,The Duchess, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Definitely try the high tea experience between 12 and 17:00 o'clock
178,The Duchess, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"beautiful design and friendly service
high level food you feel that the chef took care of the details
the beef wellington is my favorite dish simply tasty
and the chocolate ball dessert is a must ..."
179,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food, friendly and welcoming staff. The quality is high, reflected in the prices, and rich atmosphere - but where are the people?!? I'd expect it to be busier."
180,The Duchess, 5 stars ,5 years ago,a restaurant with a cool concept... the dishes are served once ready to the center of the table and shared between guests. variaty of tastes and a neat dessert called 'the explosion'. highly recomended
181,The Duchess, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food. A real tasty experience. The place is nice and the music wonderful. However, bad service"
182,The Duchess, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Artistic and original desserts and cocktails
183,The Duchess, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Amazing food with an outstanding service in a very nice decor of a former bank branch. A bit sad if anything that the chef didn't show up more at the chef's table
184,The Duchess, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A perfect meal, tasty and special appetizers especially the liver, soft and tasty beef, most delicious dishes, especially a perfect creme brulee, excellent service, If is it possible I would give 6 (out of 5)..."
185,The Duchess, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"If u fancy a midday High Tea, or a casual lunch, this is a good option. Across the road, the same hotel has another restaurant called Mr. Porter, both are plesent."
186,The Duchess, 1 star ,4 years ago,"would not recommend it... went there for the afternoon tea/high tea. The place is beautiful and the food was good but the service was terrible, rigid and rude. I'm very disappointed and would not go back!"

196,The Duchess, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"good food, very good service, but the pricing is a bit beyond what the food merits, compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood."

204,The Duchess, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Im sorry but I’ve expected a little more attention from the staff and much better Quality cocktails for the price
205,The Duchess, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Brunch was okay, but at some point they were turning on the lights and things to set up for later services, which made us felt pretty rushed."
206,The Duchess, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Impressive venue, well designed and good menu for lunch tea or dinner. let down by the unfriendly service."
