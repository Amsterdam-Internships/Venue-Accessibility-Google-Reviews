0,Venster 33, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Small but nice selection of beers and delicious snacks. Staff are really friendly and accommodating. They currently seem to stay open longer than most other restaurants/bars in the area so that's a big plus!
1,Venster 33, 5 stars ,a month ago,There's more to love than just the Moscow mules and loaded friends at this location. A great place to relax and enjoy the scenery of this great country.
2,Venster 33, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Venster used to be a nice place I liked coming to. Unfortunately it seems it’s owned/managed by just another mediocre Amsterdam (= no service) management. I say this because I don’t want to blame the staff who works hard and does their …

8,Venster 33, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Service is slow and unprofessional. We waited for like 15 minutes to be served. Nobody came to take the order, so we placed the order through the QR-code, 2 coffees took them 15 minutes to make. Half of my coffee was spilled out. Overall it is a good and chill place in de Pijp."

12,Venster 33, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Simple menu with toasties, burgers and salads. The food was certainly a cut above average and they were more interesting than normal (not just ham/cheese between two slices of plain white bread!) and the portions were large.  We were looked after by friendly staff and it wasn’t particularly expensive."

48,Venster 33, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cosy place for a brunch where you can find a place without having to wait for half an hour. Suitable for groups. The menu is quite basic but you get what you actually expect, in big portions, which is good enough for Amsterdam!"

59,Venster 33, 2 stars ,4 years ago,A bit too expensive. Wish they did brunch. Other customers were weirdly hostile about us closing the front door to stop the place feeling refrigerator-cold.
