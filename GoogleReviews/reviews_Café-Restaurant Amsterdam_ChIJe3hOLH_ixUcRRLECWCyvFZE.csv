0,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Super different experience, unexpectedly nice and comfortable. Not too intimate but light and group/family friendly. Good menu, reasonably priced and quick service. ‚Ä¶"
1,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Baffled at the good reviews, there were only 2 good things about this place, the atmosphere and the warm bread & butter before the starter.
The food itself‚Ä¶ well you can cook better food at home I‚Äôm sure‚Ä¶
Really not worth the time or the money!          The worst food I have ever had."
2,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Not so central, but what a great place to have a bite. French brasserie style classics served in an impeccable modern style. Waiters are young, students(?), but have a smile for you all the way and are fast √°nd relaxed. Outside and inside there is enough space to cope with modern times :/
Very good!!!"
3,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicious, friendly, fast, nice. A must-visit for all locals and tourists!"
4,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,4 months ago,A very interesting spot to have dinner with your family and friends. During your stay it's impossible to miss the captivating history and magnitude of the building. The restaurant is located in a very old water pumping station which dates ‚Ä¶
5,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a surprise to find this place! A beautiful former pumping station now turned into a restaurant/cafe. I'm an architectural photographer of industrial and other places and usually see these places empty and neglected so it's great to see ‚Ä¶
6,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A very good restaurant. They have a lovely terrace on the outside with a pergola, which on a sunny day, makes me feels as if I am on holiday in Italy. Their fish platters are extremely tasty, and so are their wines. It can be quite an ‚Ä¶"
7,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Delicious food and great atmosphere
8,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great Restaurant. Location is perfect. It's close to the Westerpark. Staff is very friendly and the food is very good as well. I wouldn't choose the Vitello Tonnato as a starter. Could have been better, but the rest was very good. Prices are fair. It's a very big restaurant with an interesting interior."
9,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Good place, but more like an ‚Äúofficial one‚Äù. Not for beer with friends, but for the dinner it‚Äôs great"
10,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Situated in an old pulp station, feeling both old and modern, this is a great setting to come and enjoy some food. Can highly recommend the black Angus steak and sticky toffee pudding!"
11,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Another good dinner here in Amsterdam.  Service and food top notch. Good.selection of.wine. we eat oysters crab herrings mussels
12,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Mediocre food, good service, but beautiful building and setup! We loved the space and the feel / history of it as tourists, but it also had a good neighborhood / family dining kind of vibe. Our food was pretty average and unremarkable - seared tuna was okay, ravioli was okay, fries were too thin and salty."
13,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,5 years ago,The setting on the inside is like no other. You can tell that this site use to be historical to the city if Amsterdam. The food was nothing special. I unfortunately ordered the seafood dish which was nothing but a cold platter of creatures ‚Ä¶
14,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"For some reason we could not sit outside on smaller tables (because we were with 13 people) which was a shame with the nice weather but eventually when a large picknick table cleared, we could. Food is nice, service good be better, it seems the people serving are very young and inexperienced."
15,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Restaurant in an old restored factory building. Interesting menu. Good food. Overall a pretty good quality/price ratio. Only one downside: very slow service. We weren't in a rush, so no real problem there, but when you have to ask not once ‚Ä¶"
16,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Plenty of choices. Meat, pastas, seafood, they were all very good, especially the carpaccio. The fruits de mer platter is bigger than expected. The waiters are also friendly, but one of them forgot our water on a service table, we had to take it ourselves."
17,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 1 star ,3 months ago,The restaurant is really interesting and you can sit outside by the canal in the summer. I think it‚Äôs worth a visit but prepare yourself for bad food. It‚Äôs basic salad with no dressing and soggy fries with some meat that has no seasoning with bad service. Typically Amsterdam.
18,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice place with stunning interior. The food is great and presentation of the seafood platters alone is worth coming!
19,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Enjoyed my merguez sandwich but service was s  l  o  w. The venue itself is great, with cavernous indoor hall and nice outdoor seating by the water."
20,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Didn‚Äôt like the setting - too bright for an evening dinner and a lot of echo due to the high ceiling. Okay food.
21,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"My favorite place in Amsterdam for a quick and simple lunch or dinner. Good for kids. Industrial place, located near Westerpark. Make a reservation it is always full. The same owner ownes Dauphine and De Plantage as well. Why 4 star? ‚Ä¶"
22,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Caf√© Amsterdam never disappoints me. The service was good as always and the menu has a lot to offer.
23,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Nice atmosphere and above average food with normal price.
24,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I came for brunch. There was a beautiful green roof outside, colourful flowers, good food....really really nice to visit there."
25,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 2 stars ,a month ago,Nice environment but very average food.
26,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 1 star ,6 months ago,Disappointing experience. Ignored by the staff and burger was the worst meal I‚Äôve eaten in Amsterdam. Such a pity as it is a beautiful setting.
27,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a month ago,Big spacious place with beautiful terrace hidden in luscious green surroundings
28,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Can‚Äôt wait to return to Caf√© Restaurant Amsterdam. Wonderful, relaxed atmosphere. Family friendly, great for a date, or equally someone dining alone. Lovely menu with a ton of classics. The perfect place to while away an afternoon.."
29,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice place. We were a party of six people. Starters of oysters, Dutch shrimps, snails with butter garlic, chicken soup, coquilles, all great accompanied with viognier from the Languedoc. Main courses were steak tartare, boeuf bourguignon, ‚Ä¶"
30,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I absolutely love this place. It‚Äôs unpretentious. The staff are so friendly and kind and the food is good and decently priced. Order the Croque Madame La Suisse. You won‚Äôt be disappointed
31,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good sea food.. tasted full artichoke for the first time here..was delicious! Bit tricky to find though as Uber driver dropped us off on one of the back streets.
32,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent atmosphere, delicious food.  I had the gazpacho and haddock liver (separately üòõ), and both were delicious."
33,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This restaurant used to be a water pump station, so the place itself is amazing although it‚Äôs not in the centre. It‚Äôs very spacious, with a lot of windows and nicely decorated - white tablecloths but nothing too fancy, this is a real ‚Ä¶"
34,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,a year ago,Food was really good and the menu overall is great. The restaurant interior was also very nice. ‚Ä¶
35,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely place, great service and very good food! Spot on üëç"
36,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place. Love the eggs mayo!!
37,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 1 star ,8 months ago,Even for Amsterdam standards the service is not the best. By the grace of the waiter I was allowed to pay after asking several waiters who don't even look at you. Never again.
38,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Busy place ,fast service,tasty food.Highly recommended"
39,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,Love the food and the service. I will be back for sure.
40,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Service in the restaurant was good and didn't have to wait long for our food to arrive. I recommend sitting outside as it is a lovely setting. However, the portions were quite small and we had to ask for an extra side of chips. Also we ‚Ä¶"
41,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Menu has lot of choices and includes probably the best French food you could find in amsterdam. Beautiful place with a nice terrace on the canal
42,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worthless place. Food is fine but the service is to cry for, uninterested students on the job, they seem they are robots and hard to get their attention if you need anything"
43,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for a steak dinner. The steak frites was phenomenal and the atmosphere was a pleasant surprise. Beautiful interior and they‚Äôd just put up the MASSIVE Christmas tree for the holidays which added to the ambiance. We will definitely be back!
44,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice place in the West of Amsterdam in an old industrial building with nice dishes. Before or after eating here I highly recommend a walk in the beautiful Westerpark close by (specially in summer). An area that as a tourist you probably do not think of first but which is absolutely worth visiting!
45,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"To be honest, the food is plain fare, but reliably tasty. But it's the atmosphere! It's the place for celebrations with three generations, and full of happy memories. A great place to go with kids and grandparents, or a group of friends or ‚Ä¶"
46,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice venue, good food. Been here for a Sunday lunch. The venue is immense - a former water station now converted to a restaurant / bar, with options to sit outside (note: non smoking terrace). Good food options with price ranges for ‚Ä¶"
47,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's always nice to eat here. Just can't get enough of the serene location with a lot of space and height.
The menu is superb and the mixed crowd of young and old is lovely to watch. ‚Ä¶"
48,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place with simple good food. A bit expensive.
49,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Ok food. Bit pricy but reasonable quality. However, deepfried coquilles st Jacques!?
Very little experience with the staff. Most of them were nice, but some were ‚Ä¶"
50,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Not my place. no more than that

56,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 1 star ,7 months ago,"They have no Covid measures whatsoever.

All the people close to one another despite it is a big place."
57,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great food, grat service, clean tidy and organized. I counted like 20 people stuff. I am not really into the building but overall is a 5 star venue."
58,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A nice place retrofited from old pump station building. Is located outside of old town area. The prices are bit more expensive than usually comparatively to menu list offered at this place. It' s good to come if you visit Amsterdam as a tourist.
59,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for a steak dinner. The steak frites was phenomenal and the atmosphere was a pleasant surprise. Beautiful interior and they‚Äôd just put up the MASSIVE Christmas tree for the holidays which added to the ambiance. We will definitely be back!

61,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good location and lots of kids there, so suitable for family outings. Nice building and service. But the food was just  so-so, the meat in particular is not impressive, maybe seafood is better but we didn't order them."
62,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely place for a drink, but don‚Äôt order food! My husband had a burger, worst burger ever, I had a terrible veg on French stale bread. Maybe the cakes and bitterballen are good."
63,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice rustic atmosphere of a refurbished old factory. Some of the original machinery has been left behind to create the ambiance. Very diverse menu. Ample choices and everything seems delicious. Good service, good wines, definetely worth the somewhat spicier pricing"
64,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Our waitress was slow, there was confusion during ordering and when our seafood platter came out lobster was not cooked properly as someone in the kitchen messed up the process of cooking and lobster organs released a green acid over all ‚Ä¶"
65,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Great location and service, lacklustre food. Nice seafood platter but mains were uninspiring. Rub eye tasted like a pub rump. Sweat breads were not crispy but soggy. Fish was tasteless and fries and steak was boring. Presentation of mains was very basic. Platter was nice but overpriced. Ambience was incredible and service reasonable."
66,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Visit this if you are tired of so many tourist-only kind of places. This one is 99% local people, eating local food and drinks. A bit noisy but worth a visit. Food quality is just average. I recommend trying smoked fish for starter, and sirloin (Black Angus steak) as main course. Risotto was also good, as well as sticky toffee cake."
67,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We're just getting to know this place as we recently started exploring this part of town a bit more. And I really like it. An old warehouse type building creates a huge sense of space with high high ceilings and a couple of different ‚Ä¶
68,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Totally unexpected gem outside the centre. A beautiful example of the restorative architecture, able to fit a 60ft Xmas tree indoors. Friendly staff, tried morning coffee and will be back for a proper meal."
69,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Huge venue with food that was pretty good though portions were not large (especially the starters). Staff are a bit young and shows in the service levels (asked for a beer a number of times and 20 minutes later it arrived as I was leaving).
70,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Dinner for a party of 8. The menu is big with basic food. Food seems to come from one of the local wholesalers catering for restaurants: is the gravy is from a package. Little imagination, but that is also part of the charm. The service is ‚Ä¶"
71,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Enormous, spacious old factory hall. Mix of high-end (mostly French) dishes and Dutch comfort food. Service decent but nothing special."
72,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Big restaurant in old water filtering facility. Good for big families events. Little bit noisy but very nice atmosphere. Good food but not special. We liked the fish dishes a lot.
73,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing venue that's worth the seeing at least once. The food is expensive for what you get. Steak is tough and seafood quite fishy. Good wine selection, good for big groups but book ahead. Service is decent."
74,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The restaurant is located in an old factory, which has been very attractively styled and interesting.  The menu is moderately to fairly expensive.  Each group of tables is serviced by 4 to 5 waitstaff.  Our group of four arrived early, were ‚Ä¶"
75,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great location in an old water filtering plant. Big varied menu mixing classic, basics and luxurious items to fit your mood and appetite. A neighborhood family restaurant with an upscale feel (and vice versa)."
76,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,lovely staff and the food is great - carrot cake cream is Brilliant - however the tables are quite close together and appear to be set up of bigger groups however it is a minor issue as smaller groups can be accommodated and I'd definitely return for more carrot cake
77,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great terrace overlooking a quiet slice of Amsterdam. We only had drinks but they had a great beer and wine selection. Their staff was also attentive and welcoming.
78,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Have been coming here for more than a decade. Awesome space with great, informal and relaxed vibe. In the summer try the outdoor terrace. Food is classic cafe with some special more wxotic twits. Good bier selection as well. As a dessert recommend the sticky toffee cake."
79,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Cool building, something industrial, beginning of the 20th century. Loud though. Nice no thrills food. Good voor lunch and diner. Great wines too. We especially love their seafood. We're fans of their king crab legs! Best in Amsterdam for that price. For the rest nothing creative, but really decent. Nice staff."
80,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 1 star ,6 years ago,"My review 2 years ago of this place was ""Great venue. Food and service isn't that special"". Went here today,  friend ordered a steak with mushroom sauce, it showed up with only fries, steak & mayo. I ordered some liver that showed up almost complete raw."
81,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,4 years ago,A huge place with a lot of space and high ceiling. Industrial feel. They have a very nice terrace. A lot of variety and choices on the menu and drinks. Food quality was average. Personnel is friendly. Service was ok.
82,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Always good tiramisu.
83,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"big, industrial-looking restaurant. we went there for dinner, without any reservation, and we could still get a table. the staff- bit clumsy and careless with the customers, as we entered the restaurant and nobody asked us anything, so ‚Ä¶"
84,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Menu: Wide array of ""grand cafe fare"" with fresh soups, salads and snacks to delicious and well presented mains with vegetable,  fowl and meat options to satisfy most. ‚Ä¶"
85,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The gap between what my expectations were for this place and what a poor performance it delivered is unimaginable. We went there based on a recommendation and were fascinated by the old building. Food was - to put it nicely - pretty sad. ‚Ä¶
86,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Smoke-free terrace! One of, if not the only, smoke-free terraces in the Netherlands. I moved to Amsterdam and harder to get used to than the weather is how many people here smoke. Sucks sitting outside and always having smoke blowing in your face. Not here! The service is friendly and they have interesting beers on tap."
87,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 1 star ,3 years ago,Everybody who came here (all five of us) got sick from the seafood platter. I have been sick for three days and missed multiple business meetings. ‚Ä¶
88,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very good restaurant. It has a lovely interior and beautiful garden for the summer. Service is always good here. We usely order the fruit de mere here (it is pretty darn good) so I don't really know how the rest of the menu is... But the dessert are awesome!
89,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great seafood platter and service. Even though we were with a big group we got served on time with a smile on the face. Well done team!
90,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The service can be a bit slow, but it would be churlish to mark them down given how good the food can be. My wife finally had the sea food platter and it didn't disappoint."
91,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place with an interesting atmosphere, the variety of food on the menu is great but when i selected a vegetarian dish it was nothing extra, nor the taste or the ingredients specially for this mid-range price. The stuff is helpful but sometimes they forget orders or are too slow."
92,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had a fantastic evening there, good friendly service and a marvellous team ! Good delicious food. We have been served by Mees, top notch ! We are repeating customers whole year through. Nice Xmas atmosphere. Thank you"
93,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It's a very pleasant place where you can enjoy your delicious meal and also have a conversation with a group of friends. Really good food and friendly staff.
94,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The service was great, but the prices seemed a bit high for what was offered.  I also came here as a recommendation from several sites that said it was kid friendly, but I did not feel that was the case.  Not a bad place to eat, but definitely not a place I would take my young children to again."
95,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Huge loft like restaurant transformed from an old factory. Very nice service and delicious food with a big variety. Good for bigger groups, take last minute reservation."
96,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Food was average.. but ambiance is nice
97,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Everything we tasted perfect
98,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,a year ago,Never order the steak frites. Worst cut of beef ever (not exaggerating). But fish was great supposedly.
99,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice place in the building of the former water company. Worth a visit primarily because of the venue. Otherwise, service is slow and quality of the food leaves to be desired."
100,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Amazing food, very good service !"
101,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Avoid at any cost if u plan to have a dinner there. The place is huge, stuffed with tables, crowded and looks like a student canteen. The dishes are overpriced, visually unattractive, salads served in flat dishes..."
102,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The syaff is not as attentive as you would expect for the d√©cor or prices. The food is good, not great, but good. I suspect the prices are a result of the location and the d√©cor. Recommend for pictures or a carefree meal before or after a walk in the park."
103,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool place for meetings. Very personal but maybe it matters to someone, I was disappointed to hear that the terrace is non smoking, therefore I avoid going there for coffee now :)"

The lobster was great.
Also the lamp chop was delicious. ‚Ä¶"

Located in a huge industrial hall."
108,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I concur with the my peers, the location is unique and the food is legit. It does however feel like you are eating in a factory, so if you are looking for a quiet intimate setting, this ain't it"
109,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Soooo good, and they also have very good service."
110,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I can't get all the 5 stars on the other reviews...this place is pretty average, just good for big groups of friends, service is a bit caotic and food not that amazing, it's ok-ish."
111,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place for dinner or just a coffee in the afternoon. The restaurant is a very big indoor open space, seems to lack a bit of qcoziness."
112,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good standard Dutch bistro fare. It is a haunt for Amsterdammers on a Friday evening. Cheap eats and generally good price for quality.
113,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Service is okay but to many servers, crab was frozen and tasteless and the oysters weren't even washed. Nice view tho üíÅ"
114,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The staff is superficially friendly and not very professional. Overall nice, though. The food is bland and therefore a bit overpriced. The terrace alongside the water is nice."

122,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This huge restaurant in an old water works turbine room has a great menu for a big family meal and plenty of space for children to run around while adults finish up their coffees.
123,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 1 star ,5 years ago,Service is rude as is the case with majority of the dutch in general! Meal is bland and overpriced! Advice: teach staff manners and cook! Avoid this restaurant!!!!!

128,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Even for Dutch standard the service is beyond horrible, and the food is over priced for medium quality. Would recommend avoiding especially with so many better places around"
129,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great ambience. Busy so do make reservation. Only main course took an hour before it was served.

131,Caf√©-Restaurant Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great ambiance. Worth to visit once. Service was fast and good. Food was not outstanding but delicious.
