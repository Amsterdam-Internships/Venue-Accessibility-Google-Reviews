The mere existence of this project, and the amazing people who make it, makes my heart happier and transformed my connection with the city. â€¦"
1,MKZ, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Awesome place, awesome people, awesome food. Everything is so delicious and the joint is super laid back. Come here for good vegan food!"
2,MKZ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent vegan place. it is a nonprofit run by volunteers.
We went on a night when for 5 euro you get 3 course set menu. It might always be this way. â€¦"
3,MKZ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Top vegan place, love it. Hard to reserve, but try, opens only on the weekends (check their agenda) very casual and different from a classic restaurant, the MKZ dinners are prepared by collectives. And always, always amazing. Beer selection is good, wines not really. ;)"
4,MKZ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"On Wednesdays and Fridays they offer a vegan dinner. For 5â‚¬ you get the whole menu (starter, main dish, dessert). You can have more bread if you need it of course :). You have to wash your dishes after you're done. And that's it. The place is lovely, people are the best, and they have a good selection of drinks also."
5,MKZ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great volunteer run restaurant with an outstanding mission & vision. Vegan food should be cheaper than non-vegan and these guys are showing how that's done with 3 course meals for just 5 Euro! Plus 1,5 Euro bottles beers!!"
6,MKZ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is amazing. There is a big family atmosphere here and they make everyone feel welcome. I went on a Saturday and it was pay what you want, the money goes to a cause, you serve yourself, wash the plate, and they then serve you the next portion. It's fantastic ðŸ‘Œ"
7,MKZ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great vegan food for next to nothing! You usually get a soup for starters, then a hearty, tasty main course and an amazing (often raw chocolate) desert. That's right, a three-course meal for just 5 euro! Beers 1,50 euro."
8,MKZ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"So happy we went there. Great atmosphere, nice people but most importantly -amazing vegan food for only 5 euros. Thank you everyone for organizing this."
9,MKZ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place! Cosy and relaxed. Don't come here looking for a fancy meal....cone here looking for a chilled out place with warm vibes. Food is nice...and cheap. Remember,  you need to wash your own dishes :-)"
10,MKZ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great alternative place, amazing people that are working for good causes, friendly atmosphere. Great food of course, but this place is so much more than just a place to eat. You have to go and find out for yourself :) Enjoy !"
11,MKZ, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"If you're in Amsterdam and looking for a vegan meal served in an anarchist squat coop kitchen, then head out to MKZ on the Southwest side near Vondelpark. Call around 2:30 to make reservations, or if want to find out if you can volunteer"
12,MKZ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Simply amazing. No hassle with picking food, since there's only 1 dish per round. This one dish however... If you're reading this, go there :)"
