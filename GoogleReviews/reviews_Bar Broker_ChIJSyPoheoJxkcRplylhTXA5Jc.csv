0,Bar Broker, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"This place is actually quite cool with the price of different alcohol varying all the time based on the amount sold, just like the stock market, that's why it's called ""Broker"", but the music there is really soso, it's said to be much ‚Ä¶"
1,Bar Broker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty cool place, nice vibes, great music and funky variable pricing on the drinks. Staff is friendly and the interior is pretty quaint. It‚Äôs a great place to have a Friday night drink with colleagues or go for a night out with friends. There‚Äôs plenty of dancing as well as areas to sit and chat."
2,Bar Broker, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Went here for a storytelling event. Very cool, local crowd. Bartenders were fun and interactive even to an English speaker. Good drinks, fun venue and just off the beaten path from the overly busy Rembrandtplein which is an expensive tourist trap. Will visit again!"
3,Bar Broker, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"it's okay, not bad not good, music wasn't super, plus i found it expensive..not my kind of place to be honest.. seen much better. not trying to be rude but just being honest. location is good though central and easy to find.."
4,Bar Broker, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Got a bit confused on the lgbt/straight crowd, it's more gay-friendly. Good idea with the variable prices for drinks, never saw that before. Good music :-)"
5,Bar Broker, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Fun concept. But only went there around midnight where the place was a bit worn already. Still had fun dancing!
6,Bar Broker, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Looked like a fun place to go but if you can't speak Dutch, you probably won't get in.."
7,Bar Broker, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Cool bar,  ideal for a night out with a bunch of friends! I definitely enjoyed it."
8,Bar Broker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,See the price of drinks go up and down and get the best deals while partying.  Make photos in the photo booth for memories.
