0,Genootschap der Geneugten, 1 star ,4 months ago,The beers are nice but the service is awful. The waiter acted like a '' I know better'' paying no attention to what I was ordering. Service really needs to change.
1,Genootschap der Geneugten, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Is a nice cafe old Dutch style you can go and drink here, it is also used as a waiting place for cafe de Klos across the street"
2,Genootschap der Geneugten, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I‚Äôve been here on multiple occasions while waiting for a seat at Cafe De Klos.  The bartender has always been friendly. The beer cold and the music is great.
3,Genootschap der Geneugten, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The bar with two lamps. Right opposite the famous Cafe de Klos, this one is a great option for a silent drink surrounded by friendly staff. It's also great if you're waiting for a table at Klos (and you probably are if you haven't made a booking) because it's run by the same people."
4,Genootschap der Geneugten, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great bar with good beer.  The staff were cool too especially Alina. It's just across the road from cafe de klos which did damn good ribs.
Put your name down in there first and they'll come find you in here when your table is ready, usually 1-2 hours so have a couple of amber ales."
5,Genootschap der Geneugten, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"There are plenty of pubs in Amsterdam, but for us the locals, there are very few pubs where we feel at home. This is one of them. We are not bothered by flashy decorations or pubs trying too hard to attract customers. You want good ‚Ä¶"
6,Genootschap der Geneugten, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This bar belongs to the restaurant ""de Klos"" across the street. We were redirected to have drinks here whilst waiting for a meal worth waiting for. ‚Ä¶"
7,Genootschap der Geneugten, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Came here to wait for a table across the street. For some reason the beers were small and half foam. Got sent off with ""that's the way they should be"" while plenty of pints were running around. ‚Ä¶"
8,Genootschap der Geneugten, 1 star ,3 years ago,"THE WORST BAR IN THE WORLD
We wanted a cocktail bar for our saturday night.... but we found the worst bar in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
9,Genootschap der Geneugten, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Cool little bar owned by the same people of Cafe du Clos across the street. Robin was our bartender and he was great. Took pictures for us and lots of small talk. Worth the wait for the food
10,Genootschap der Geneugten, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The food is amazing and to the point.

If you're are there definitely you should try the shoulder. It's the signature of this restaurant, quite expensive but definitely worth it."
11,Genootschap der Geneugten, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want to go for a drink in a old brown bar, you should definitely go here! Great bartenders with a lot of knowledge of the beers. My favorite brown bar for so far."
12,Genootschap der Geneugten, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"If this was the place, the bar had amazing character. Bumped into some locals looking for some nice jazz music and the bartender here was full of recommendations. Stayed for some beer and enjoyed their music..."
13,Genootschap der Geneugten, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Very nice decor. Service is more about showmanship than actual expertise. Depends on what you're looking for, I guess. Basically a waiting room for De Klos on the other side of the street."
