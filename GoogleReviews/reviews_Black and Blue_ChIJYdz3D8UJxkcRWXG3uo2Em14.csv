0,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,a week ago,"It was okay. We ordered a tenderloin and half of lobster and bruschetta. French fries were great. We paid around 65‚Ç¨, why it was okay, was more the Ambiance and the staff. I wasn‚Äôt dressed up and showed up casually. Felt judged and weirdly looked at. Besides that food and service time was fine"
1,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great place for a date night. The oysters and the scallops are really great starters! For the main course, we ordered the 600gm rib eye with half a lobster; this was a great meal for two. The meat is so good, I advice that you get it rare ‚Ä¶"
2,Black and Blue, 3 stars ,a month ago,"Not the first time you be in this place. Tonight was the best experience. Food was ok , fast .. we got 2 glasses of bubbles on the house since was love day ‚ù§Ô∏è (nice gesture) ! However, salad is 19 eur , stake 29eur.. a bit expensive right ? ‚Ä¶"
3,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"I liked this place, I would like to return soon. You can be seated close to the entrance or in the salon, it has a nice decoration, kinda fancy.
The food was good, they aimed the medium rare in my meat which I appreciate a lot. The food and beverages met my expectations and fit right with the prices."
4,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Really good meat, tasty scallops. Foods arrived very quick. A bit of wait to get our booked table (strongly advise to book as very popular place)"
5,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Great dinner, slow service but very efficient, the steaks ü•© were simply amazing and the starters too, great selections of winesüç∑,  the Cornish hen was really tasty too. I love this place and will be back to keep tasting others, amaron wine was delicious"
6,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Just had lunch there today.  I am not a chef, but I have worked in a kitchen many years.  The ingredients were fresh and quality.  The menu is perfect.  We stopped in by chance due to weather and were grateful for the amazing experience."
7,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Cozy place, nice ambient. Very polite and funny waiter. Food was delicious. Soup of the day which was carrot soup that day was very tasty as well as black agnus tenderloin and choco dessert."
8,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Super nice staff, very friendly and fun! Nice food with reasonable price. Fries and salad are unlimited. Very good beefsteak and lobster!"
9,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very nice restaurant, with good fresh food and a decent drink selection. The service however tends to be a bit slow - as they seem to be understaffed. But otherwise, good place to go for lunch or dinner."
10,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great restaurant and the staff are really friendly and helpful. The food is amazing and cooked as you like it which is super important when it comes to steak. The free refills on salad and fries as well üëç
11,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Food is really good and service was spot on. One waitress made a fuss because we got our own birthday cake and argued we should have notified in advance. When making the reservation I did notified it was the birthday of one of us and asked for any birthday special. Never got a reply.
12,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Good bistro/steak house located in central Amsterdam; Nice staff.
Proce on average for the local standards."
13,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,a month ago,"The meat is so good, I advice that you get it rare to medium rare."
14,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Excellent place for Grilled Steaks and Seafood in Amsterdam they actually cook the steaks on a coal grill.
15,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great location, awesome food and very good service. The catch of the day and the pineapples from the josper were the best dishes :)"
16,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Excellent restaurant, great staff and food and also a good price! The restaurant is located at a great spot in Amsterdam (at the canal). You really have to visit in Amsterdam!"
17,Black and Blue, 3 stars ,a month ago,Let‚Äôs start with the good. It‚Äôs a hip place. Good vibes in middle of Amsterdam. The service is top with friendly staff. But that is where things stop. Food is not what I was expecting. We got the Cornish hen and lobster. Felt like they ‚Ä¶
18,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service, decent steak and lovely setting. The garlic prawns are a generous starter, great for sharing too. We went for the ribeye sharer; it was beautifully cooked and the sides are bottomless, not that we needed any more than we were first served. Both of our desserts were delicious too!"
19,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,a year ago,We had an absolutely wonderful dinner experience here! High quality food cooked simply and to perfection üëå  friendly service and comfortable but lively atmosphere. Highly recommend.
20,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great boat ride through Amsterdam, especially if you wanna enjoy with your group of friends, celebrate Bdays etc. I suggest dressing warm if it's not summer üòâ"
21,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A really nice and pretty decorated restaurant. Really love the design. The service was the whole evening really great, big smile, some small talk and the plates were fast at our table. Alle the courses were great and pretty tasteful. We highly recommend this restaurant and definitely come back again."
22,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Wonderful atmosphere with friendly staff. Food was very good, but not exceptional. Some of the lobster was mushy, and the steak wasn't quite as flavorful as we had hoped. Still, all in all, it was an enjoyable evening."
23,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Beautiful place, good food and very kind staff. Relaxing atmosphere and warm light"
24,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing restaurant. Very easy to locate. Cosy and warm design. The staff are very friendly and energetic. The menu is clear and rich. I ordered the Chef's Steak, a 200 grams cut similar to tenderloin cut but a little bit thinner and more ‚Ä¶"
25,Black and Blue, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"The food was good, and price quality ratio is pretty decent. 3 of us ordered steaks which got our thumbs up, and I had a salad with steak topping (generous serving). But I can only give this place 3 stars because of its poor service which ‚Ä¶"
26,Black and Blue, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Staff were nice and it's very pretty place but totally not worth it. We waited about half an hour before anyone took our order then another hour before we got our food. In the meantime the waitress asked if we wanted our bill, we'd been ‚Ä¶"
27,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Such a good place.
Service is fantastic, very friendly staff and helpful with recommendations, everything from food to wine. ‚Ä¶"
28,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Decor and food was good, but the bar area had a strong scent of stale beer. I think the dining room area was a little nicer, I would head upstairs next time! Everything was fresh and delicious. We enjoyed the burrata and cocktails."
29,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely loved this little gem, was very busy but we didn't wait long for a table, very lucky! Food was delicious, other half had steak and loved it, I had lobster and could have eaten it again it was so nice. You if free refills on chips and salad, what more could you want! Staff were lovely. Highly recommend"
30,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"The food is really good, however the service can be a bit slow. We reserved a table during very busy hours on Saturday and the crowd was so loud, it was hard to have a conversation. The table was not cleaned when we sat down, but our ‚Ä¶"
31,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Amazing service from Linda. Good price/value balance. Definitely going back there again!
32,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"it's a classic  example of a successful cosmopolitan restaurant...you can enjoy not just the real juiciest freshest meat and seafood food in the area but the excellent costumer service; very nice personal, fresh food, and very tasty ‚Ä¶"
33,Black and Blue, 1 star ,4 months ago,Unlike the other reviewers I found the service terrible. The young girls didn't seem to know what they were doing and left us hanging for a long time. The male waiter was pushy and rude. Food was good but not enough to justify the price. Always crowded and loud. Do not recommend.
34,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The atmosphere of the restaurant is pleasant with dim lighting and it‚Äôs also beautiful decorated and very clean.
I had the tasty and super juicy beef steak which went along great with garlic,a ‚Ä¶"
35,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice to sit outside. Steak was tasty and good cocktails. Friendly service. Very difficult to eat the salad that accompanies the food. Hard to get it out the narrow bowl, spilling it on the floor and table & no place to put it on the wooden board."
36,Black and Blue, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Unprofessional service, for that scale of restaurant. Didn‚Äôt deserve the good rating! ‚Ä¶..
Bad management, not fault of the water. ‚Ä¶"
37,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food and atmosphere are good. Priced above average. Best to book a table for dinner in advance, especially in the second half of the week, as it tends to be quite full."
38,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,An absolutely charming spot to enjoy lunch next to the canal. The hostess was so lovely and kind. I sat outside and people watched as folks on bikes and foot passed by. Order a coffee or tea and you receive a macaroon. Would definitely come again when I'm in Amsterdam.
39,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great ambience and great food! Also 3 nice beers in draught! The burgers and steaks are served with  a side salad and awesome fries! Oh and don‚Äôt forget to try the cocktails!
40,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty good. Unlimited fries and salad. Try the scallops if you go. My steak was a little over cooked but my girlfriends steak was perfect. Good wine selection and atmosphere. Good service also. Make reservations, this place gets busy."
41,Black and Blue, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Mixed feelings‚Ä¶ Good food (even though the ordered steaks were well done instead of medium etc.) but horrible service and wrong invoice. Great potential but you have to level up your service to match your potential and pricing‚Ä¶!
42,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Incredible nice atmosphere, nice wine selection , excellent steaks and desserts.
We didn‚Äôt have a reservation, but the nice waiters found a cozy table for us. ‚Ä¶"
43,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food. Service was fast and nice. They have french fries refill!! The meat is awesome and the lobster as well. Price is also ok. If I visit Amsterdam again I will definetly visit this place again.
44,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fancied a steak and we had seen this place online and walked past a few times. It looked legit. Booked a table online no problem. It was really busy for a Sunday night. We were say right at the back which is really nice and out of the way ‚Ä¶
45,Black and Blue, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Heard good things about this restaurant, but the food was so so, and the service was poor. So slow we needed to call the waitress twice to understand why our main course didn't arrive after 55 minutes of waiting."
46,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Let me start by saying the service is excellent. You get welcomed in and are seated comfy at a spacious table. The meat is superb and you get fries and salad as supplements. The fries and salad can be refilled unlimited times (for free), ‚Ä¶"
47,Black and Blue, 1 star ,5 months ago,Worst experience in a long time. Orders took ages to be served and then they brought it wrong. When they finally served the right meal it came cold. ‚Ä¶
48,Black and Blue, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Were there with 5 people. Tables relatively closely lined up. Food did not come as ordered, little reaction to the request. Only one operator was able to understand. Organization not good."
49,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food! Great service, cosy atmosphere. Best steak I've ever had! Ordered medium well and got it.
Prices okay! Paid around 67 ‚Ç¨ for two (steaks, pommes , salad, drinks, butter)."
50,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Found this place really late whilst looking for places to eat in the area. Managed to book a late table on Google which went through successfully which I was glad about as a lot of reviews have said that it is rather busy there which it is. ‚Ä¶
51,Black and Blue, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Steak was above average. Service was so horrible. Rude is the right word.
Steak looks like a sample. I wonder why the salad and fries is all you can eat.
Plates stayed on the table way while after we finished."
52,Black and Blue, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"The food here is always AMAZING and for that reason, I hesitated a little about writing this review. We came Sunday evening and it was fairly quiet but there were loadsss of staff on for the amount of customers that were there. There was a ‚Ä¶"

Staff were very busy but still friendly and thoughtful, have been other nice restaurants in Amsterdam while visiting, this one is my favorite!"
56,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is good, but the friendly staff makes the whole experience very nice.  Atmosphere was pleasant for dining.  I was planning to have a quick bite before my boat tour but ended up rescheduling my boat tour so I can enjoy a full meal ‚Ä¶"
57,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great dinner.  Charcoal ovens have the steak a wonderful and unique taste!  Cucumber in my G&T is my new fav thing.

61,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent service and food. Quirine and Alex made sure we were taken care of with both the restaurant experience and the Amsterdam night life. The meat and cheese platter we're absolutely delicious.
62,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great experience! The place is nice, cozy and not full of tourists. Steaks were well prepared and seemed not overpriced. And we were super surprised by unexpected birthday present for my girlfriend! 10/10"
63,Black and Blue, 1 star ,a month ago,They were very rude and impolite. We went there with my 3 years old son and he was a little naughty. The manager got angry and shout at us. It was really disrespectful.
64,Black and Blue, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"The food was really good, some of the service was disappointing which leads to only 3 stars. More than a 30 minute wait to order a drink. However once the waiter changed, we had an enjoyable evening. You will not be disappointed with the food."
65,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Beautiful restaurant in the best area. Loved our entire meal from start to finish and the hospitality. ‚ÄúBottomless‚Äù fries was a bonus too.
66,Black and Blue, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Really good service when we showed up at 645 and the food was good. BUT the service got really really bad once it got busy. ‚Ä¶
67,Black and Blue, 1 star ,5 months ago,I ordered a 250g steak but I ended up with a 160g steak and it was cold. So I would not recommend it.
68,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great burgers and friendly staff. Fries were also unlimited! Good beer on tap also.
69,Black and Blue, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Cold meat, warmed afterwards and as a result overkooked, not how it‚Äôs intend to be. Stuff is trying to be nice and do their best."
70,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice place for a treat.

We went to the Back and Blue for dinner. We got the last table by luck so be ‚Ä¶"
71,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A very nice place to eat and a great menu and enjoyed the sea bass and great selection of beers on tap and bottle.  The staff are most welcoming and very attentive.  Good place to bring friends and enjoy good company over a meal.

There was a lot of mistakes in our order and they actually took so long time to get the menu for us .. I don‚Äôt recommend it at all .. the manager was very good but they all had one excuse that it‚Äôs crowded and very busy !!!
82,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I expected a good steak but got an amazing one, and I mean amazing...

83,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Simply just perfect. The food is brillant and the staff as well. I can highly recommend it!!!
84,Black and Blue, 1 star ,7 months ago,"The staff were rude, the only reason we didn‚Äôt leave it was because we were starving and hoping for the food to be good, which wasn‚Äôt. ‚Ä¶"

102,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We like to ask locals where to eat when we travel. They usually give great recommendations and this was a goodie. Lovely unique restaurant with great food. We got the rib eye for 2. It was excellent!
103,Black and Blue, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,"The meats were okay, but the desserts were really bad and overpriced."
104,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice and cozy atmosphere, waitress super kind, the large rib eye steak is very good the salads and friets are unlimited, although very simple salad. Not much choice of apetizers and dessert."
105,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Wonderful Friendly staff.Excellent wine menu and amazing food only one complaint salad limp tasteless
106,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The restaurant lies just on a quiet street off of Keizergracht, one of the main streets in Amsterdam, just by the canal. The atmosphere of the restaurant is comfortable and provides for a nice view of the canals. Even though the waiting ‚Ä¶"
107,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Ribeye and lobster were very good, tartar was somewhat disappointing, though ingredients tasted decent. Primitivo was mediocre."

109,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very nice hostess! Friendly and knowledgeable, really went the extra mile. The wines were good and wine prices were also reasonable. We were offered to order as much of the side dishes, as we wanted. The steak was very tasty. I can ‚Ä¶"

114,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food and great service. The roasted pork was absolutely amazing. Crispy outside but the inside will melt in your mouth. As a starter I had the burrata. You can really tell they use quality ingredients there. Super fresh and soft ‚Ä¶

118,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I must say excellent steak, good wine and fantastic service. The waitress saw that we had looked at the outside table when we arrived and she asked if we‚Äôd prefer to sit there than inside at our ‚Äòreserved‚Äô table as the weather was so good. ‚Ä¶"
119,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food was great. Plates sizewise were kinda small but taste and quality of meat was excellent. Cozy and warm place!!! Service as in all Netherlands was kind of slow but this is a cultural thing. Just have plenty of time to enjoy your meal!!!

122,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very beautiful interior! Cozy and welcoming. The staff is super friendly. The prices are normal. The chocolate fountain with the ice cream is so so good you have to try it. We did not order a main dish but we definitely go again!
123,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Fashionable restaurant in the heart of the city. Inside it's too dark, feels a bit oppressive. The food was tasty, portions were OK, and having unlimited fries helps a lot. You pay a premium for the location and the looks more than for the food itself, but overall it's a good place to eat."
124,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The Black and Blue restaurant is a nice place to eat meat or a lobster.

126,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Serves could have been a lot better. Stood there for a while before being seated. Didn't take our dishes away and asked if we wanted a refill of the chips and salad half an hour after finishing. But the food was very good. I had scallops for starter and steak for main.
127,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was excellent! Alex and his staff were really friendly, the service was very professional and welcoming. The  the food was very well prepared, with a lot of flavour. We had the Angus burger and tenderloin steak. The Josper oven really made it. Really nice area of Amsterdam, would highly recommend."
128,Black and Blue, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Honest review, atmosphere and setting very relaxed, food is way below average. Not to the level of a restaurant that calls itself a ""Steakhouse"". Much better places to eat good meat in Amsterdam. Also, don't order the lobster, it felt like eating mashed potatoes."
129,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food was fantastic. Staff very polite. Very cosy place

150,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent restaurant with very friendly staff. They advertise as serving steaks and salads. We had salads which were huge.These come with chips and you can have extra chips on request. A really good meal. We went quite early on a Sunday and had no problem getting a table but it's probably best to book.
151,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Burger was delicious. Served with fries and salad (as much as you can eat)
152,Black and Blue, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Steak really nice. Burger was burned, yet replaced in no time with a good one. Staff is a little stressed- the owner has each and every centimeter in this restaurant covered with tables. Result is, it gets very loud, feels extremely cramped and one nearly gets claustrophobia. Since the food is nice: COULD be angeraten place"

155,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I have eaten here a few times and it has become a favourite of mine.  The steak is simple, prepared perfectly and a basic spice options.  The staff are professional and pleasant.  The endless fries and salad make staying a longer easy to do."
156,Black and Blue, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"To start with the food, this was pretty good. Nice starters. Main - the steak was very nice and tender, though a bit cold. The lobster (+surf option) was a bit over cooked. Nice selection of wines, and very reasonably priced. ‚Ä¶"

159,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious meat! That‚Äôs what you come here for. Various types of steak and nice starters is what you‚Äôll find on the menu.

164,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I liked my tenderloin, which comes with fries and a salad, and wine. The service was good too. My company paid, so it was a free lunch for me. This might have affected my view in its favor, though. :)"

Service  was great as the wait staff was attentive and courteous.  Ambiance and decor were unique.  Highly recommend!
172,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly service. Good food. Reasonable prices. Very nice size portions. The two top window seat is the best but sitting at the small bar can be fun to chat with the hurried bartender.
173,Black and Blue, 1 star ,3 years ago,Tried to get into this restaurant earlier today for an early evening drink. Staff were offhand telling me that it was all booked up when it obviously was not got the impression that they were happy to do as little as possible rather than go ‚Ä¶

179,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Steak was exquisitely cooked, with a great bearnaise! Served with roasted garlic, tomato, scallion and maldon salt. On the side, fries were crispy and salad was fresh. To top it all off, the gin and tonic was perfect and refreshingly cucumber-forward. A perfect kind of restaurant to stumble upon in Amsterdam."
180,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The servive was great as well as the food. Perfect steak and the lobster was a dream.
If you are in Amsterdam you should realy come and pay the restaurant a visit."

185,Black and Blue, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Mediocre burger. Patty too compacted, overcooked and flavourless. Fries ordinary (also overcooked). Starters great. Winelist interesting and service excellent."
186,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great stakehouse that provides quality food, the setting on the banks of the canal is perfect and ideal to watch the boats go by and people watch. You will need to book a table in advance not to be disappointed."
187,Black and Blue, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service! Unfortunately the beef tenderloin, although perfectly medium rare, was chewy. Not sure how that's possible. I would go here again, but I wouldn't order the steak. The Cornish hen looked good."

192,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"On a quieter street in Amsterdam, in a pretty location. Really nice restaurant, great food and service. We enjoyed some bitterballen for the first time - definitely worth a try. Steak is one of their specialities. The have a Josper oven so the steaks were exceptional. Worth a visit reasonable price given the location."
193,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good food. Not epic...just good. we were a big thirsty group and had to wait a little too long between beers. one of us was borderline unservable and they cut him off nicely. The rest went parched in the throat.
194,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Had three dinners there. Really good steaks, polite and attentive service, but the girls are slightly unexperienced in making cocktails and drinks. The bar table is covered by the waitresses' stuff, trays and used glasses and plates..."

196,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent food here. We opted for the shared steak and it was super. Top food and the service was good too. The toilets are located down several stairs if you have a mobility problem.
197,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Small but eminently capable! A clear menu - everyone will find something. It's a little cost-intensive but if you like good quality food in a nice atmosphere with friendly personal - it's worth having to dig deep into your pocket! üëå

202,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Clebrated my 30th birthday as we treated ourselves to an upscale steak dinner before a night out on the town. The ambiance is quite pleasing, creating a warm and cozy atmosphere. A variety of wine to choose from, to help compliment their juicy/tender sirloin."
203,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Flavoursome steak dishes in small portions. Modern, sleek decor. Not great value, but enjoyable. Waiter quite insistent about getting his tip (made it all a bit uncomfortable)."

215,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I really liked the food and ambience here! Nice place to have some good food where you can also have a normal conversation. -1 star because the seating/space is not always great .
216,Black and Blue, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Not attentive! Nice staff but really not attentive. They missed 2 things we have ordered. Also the food isn't great. Cool atmosphere on the inside but I honestly wouldn't recommend and certainly wouldn't come back again
217,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place , the soup of the day (carrot & ginger was beautiful, however I would say that the steaks are over rated in my personal opinion!!"
218,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Their tomato soup is my favorite thing on the menu next to their fries!!!
219,Black and Blue, 1 star ,3 years ago,Service wise is one of the worst I've ever been. Waitress doesn't even listen to you til the end. She just storms off in the middle of the conversation. I could see other customers were also not pleased with the service. AND the food is soo mediocre. Money is not worth it here.
220,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and friendly staff. Only downside on the night we were in was the place was full of young females and they were all yapping away at quite high decibels, making the place very noisy."

222,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great, great staff. Food is very good. Big juicy steaks, nice salads (can't say more than ""nice"" when classifying salads. and I'm a salad fan), good wine selection."
223,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food was absolutely fantastic and the Service was even better. Alex was a phenomenal waiter with great service and suggestions. I would highly recommend this eatery.
224,Black and Blue, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Looks interesting from outside, but in fact not worth it. If you seat outside, you'll be forgotten and frozen. Rather expensive for the amount of food you get. Steaks are nothing special, really."
225,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The place is nice and welcoming. The food is very good and the portions served are correct. You even get unlimited French fries ;)
226,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to eat and drink. If you visit you have to try the Sgroppino; it is an awesome drink. The bartender was a supper nice guy! Definitely would come back again.
227,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great service and lovely food. My only recommendations would be to order my fries and salad immediately. They're unlimited and shared between two.
228,Black and Blue, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Average restaurant. Looks like they try to be fancy steak restaurant. Fancy yes, quality and knowledge of the steaks is below average. People are friendly and provide good service. Prices are good."
229,Black and Blue, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Nice location and  great menu. Definitely try their Black Angus. Some staff are exceptionally well while others are average at best. Crowd coming here is diverse depending on the day.

234,Black and Blue, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The grilled chicken sandwich on sourdough is superb! Moist, tender chicken with just a hint of grilling, with a very light swoosh of peanut sauce. The sauce had just the suggestion of anise, which made it very intriguing.  Very enjoyable."
