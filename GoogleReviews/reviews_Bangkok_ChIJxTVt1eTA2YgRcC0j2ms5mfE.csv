12,Bangkok, 5 stars ,a year ago,Been around forever. The lunch specials are good and a great value. I used to come here 1-2 times a week just for lunch. The staff always let us sit and discuss business. I would also hit it after the movies. The food is consistently good. â€¦

18,Bangkok, 1 star ,a year ago,This restaurant is one of those places that 15 years ago was great but today they are a sad reminder of what happens when a restaurant goes bad. Average food with an attitude and very poor customer service.  I paid $107.00 for 5 meals and â€¦
