0,Calle Ocho, 1 star ,7 months ago,"The restaurant is located in Albertcuyp market, so it is easy to find! But maybe because they tend to serve touristis they dont care about their customer experiences! The menus had a lot of food stains on it and it wasnt pleasent to touch ‚Ä¶"

2,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very tasty food, delicious cocktails, good vibe, prime location! The pulpo was absolutely gorgeous!!!"
3,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Over of my favourite placed in the area! Great cocktails that they tailor for you and the food is just awesome! We recommend the loaded nachos.
4,Calle Ocho, 3 stars ,a month ago,"Cocktails were nice, however, the size and the cost of the food was ridiculous. The portions are too small, which should be changed asap. Other than that the vibe inside was nice!"
5,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice ambiance, great amount of rums and bartender/owner really knows what he's doing. He made up some delicious personalized cocktails on the spot. The food was great too. We definitely come back again :)"
6,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The cocktail selection was great, everyone we had was super good and want to try many more. Really enjoyed the food, except the jackfruit was just ok (but think it's just that I don't like jackfruit). The staff were very nice and the service was fast, definitely will come back soon!"
7,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"One of the best bars in Amsterdam - amazing signature cocktails, really nice food (I'd say dishes are also signature), and great staff. It could be noisy outside at the opening as the street market getting cleaned, but it gets quieter outside (and louder inside) in the later hours."
8,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We really enjoyed our time here. The serve was excellent, we had so much fun with our waiter! The food and drinks were lovely too. Especially the quesedialles (no idea how to write this) were amazing. The only negative thing is that the dishes are very small. We will come back but you have to keep the prices in mind."
9,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Best tacos I have eaten so far! Very tasty and fresh! Even though they are quite pricey, so I can only recommend going there on taco Tuesday (3‚Ç¨ for alle tacos)"
10,Calle Ocho, 1 star ,5 months ago,"17 euro‚Äôs for 3 taco‚Äôs of the size of your thumb. After ordering each 15/20 euro‚Äùs of food and 10 euro cocktail, we left and went to get kabab as our main dish. Food was not the best, but not the worst, but half warm. Very strange. Is this te result of shrinkflation, inflation or the economic corona downfall?"
11,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice drinks, attentive staff and good atmosphere. Food was good, 4 stars because it‚Äôs overpriced for the portion sizes."
12,Calle Ocho, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Good and unique cocktails with some interesting ideas behind it. I've liked the vibe with lean back atmosphere and Spanish music. Prices a bit higher than expected but definitely worth a visit. Nevertheless the completion is very high in Amsterdam.
13,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"This is a fabulous little gem in Amsterdam that serves GREAT Mexican food and awesome cocktails. The ceviche & tacos were incredible, and the flavors were truly authentic. Highly recommended!"
14,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing taco Tuesday! Very tasty tacos. They have a bigger selection than the tacos in the Manu, what was very nice. All tacos full of flavor. I will come back!"
15,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Lovely food and great drinks! We had a chat we the bartender who took really good care of us and was a joy to talk too. Hopefully we will get to talk to him again!
16,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Unique level of hospitality. Almost perfect cocktails. Delicious tacos, quesadillas, nachos and more. An absolutely must try experience. Thank you Calle Ocho for being the way you are."
17,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I love this place!  The cocktail menu is really impressive matched with great bartenders.  Didn‚Äôt try the food, but will be back to sample.  It‚Äôs a small place and can get crowded quickly."
18,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good food, awesome vibe, and extremely friendly staff."
19,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice selection of delicious (and strong) cocktails and great service.
20,Calle Ocho, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Good but very small for the price. The ceviche for example is ~‚Ç¨13 and only has 2 shrimps. One taco is ~ ‚Ç¨6 and it is so small‚Ä¶ recently I tried, Cabron and Loca dealer and really I think Calle Ocho is the most expensive for what they serve. ;/"
21,Calle Ocho, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Cocktails are INCREDIBLE, they have good tequila and after 11 is THE BEST place to be in Amsterdam to have drinks and a good fun. ‚Ä¶"
22,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Waiters are super nice. I went there on taco Tuesday and the tacos were 2.50‚Ç¨ each instead of 6‚Ç¨. The trick is that the tacos are really small, so eventually I paid 15‚Ç¨ for 6 small tacos. I was satisfied at the end, but I was expecting a better deal for a ""special night""."

24,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"good food, nice cocktails. The pitchers of cocktails are pretty overpriced though!"
25,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved this place so much. Excellent food with great cocktails at very reasonable prices.
26,Calle Ocho, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Good food and usually good service, but my most recent experience there was not great: we had to ask for plates, cutlery, tissues, and the waiter looked at us like we had some royal level demands. Wings were burned, the cheese on the nacho ‚Ä¶"
27,Calle Ocho, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Really not recommend, we had to wait 1h to be served, the waiter was sloppy she asked us twice what we ordered because she didn‚Äôt put it in the system at the first try! Horrible service. Food was also plain and bland"
28,Calle Ocho, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"No commentary, just data for you:
Tacos: tiny, but delicious
Wait time for 1/2 liter frozen margarita from the machine: 20 minutes ‚Ä¶"
29,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We have heard this place for quite a while and finally got the chance to visit. I'd say both the food and cocktails are impressive! One of the best nachos I have had, the tacos are amazing and the chef is so creative with the recipes (one ‚Ä¶"
30,Calle Ocho, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice drinks, okay prices, small little place"
31,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I appreciate the creativity of the chef. My visit here marks my first encounter eating chicken hearts. Dessert was awesome- kudos to the genius behind that one. As mentioned by others, its rather costly for the portion size- enough to put me off of coming on any other night than Taco Tuesday."
32,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Delicious food, lovely cocktails and great service! Totally worth it!"
33,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Rating solely on Taco Tuesday: amazing. They had 8 different tacos: only 1 vegetarian and 1 shrimp‚Äîall others with meat. I‚Äôm a vegetarian, so would have been more interesting with a few options, but the flavors were big and authentic Miami. Cocktails and music were on point. Service was great. We loved it. Great find in Amsterdam."
34,Calle Ocho, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a very teenager, average place. Waiters working here are super rude. They started moving the tables to clear the space just throwing them around; they even dropped a heavy chair on me, without even excusing himself. To be honest, ‚Ä¶"
35,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"With the exception of the one time I came here too early for it to turn into a club, I have always had a great time here. The music is always fun, the drink choice is plentiful and reasonably priced and the people you meet inside are always ‚Ä¶"
36,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,a year ago,"This place is always good: the food, cocktails, vibes and very friendly and attentive staff... BUT: they don‚Äôt respect any distancing and all talk to you like half a meter away from your face which is way too close regardless corona üòä"
37,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Always fun and tasty! Love their ceviche, nachos and tacos - and of course cocktails! Friendly staff, nice Latin music and always a lot of fun!"
38,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The cocker are awesome, food really good too, nice atmosphere, great music, highly recommend"
39,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I really like this place‚Äôs cocktails. They are simple yet delicious. Sadly the place gets packed really easily so try to early to be able to get seats!
40,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great spot for cocktails and other drinks. (Not tried the food yet). There is a good cocktail menu with some originals (loved the bocada). There is also the option for a mezcal tasting, which you don't find in many other places in ‚Ä¶"
41,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Authentic bar. Great staff with lots of bartender skills. If you want to enjoy a quality alcoholic beverage or cocktail (especially rum and tequilla) this is the place for you. It has its price tho. Worth it! They only use good bottles, not ‚Ä¶"

44,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fckng good place to get pleased by prime cocktails!
45,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I've been there several times. It's a good option for cocktails in the heart of De Pijp with nice people. Never tried the food but it seems delicious. The service is also good.
46,Calle Ocho, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great little Cuban/Mexican tapas place! Shared the Nachos, Pulpo, Avocado salad and veggie quesadillas! Very tasty food, good wine and cocktail selection. Attentive and friendly service! üôå"
47,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Freshly baked nachos and frozen margarita are a must try. Excellent service with good Mexican music that will make you tap your toes.
48,Calle Ocho, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Food ok, cocktails good, service worthless!! I think I have never had a worse service in my life.. After waiting for a long time, I even had to stand up and go for extra plates that we already had asked for twice.. just horrible! The service ruins your experience, no matter how good the food would be."
49,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Bartender Arantxa was very friendly, bar is quite small but it's one of the only places in de Pijp staying open until 3am during the week.
Prices are okay."
50,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Overall great food and great drinks. Can be sorta expensive - depending on that u order .:. Very busy at night time. Not rlly nice if u want some space .:. Much better then Escobar across the road .:.
51,Calle Ocho, 1 star ,a year ago,Very bad service and moody waiters. I would not recommend this restaurant. Too expensive and lack of variety on the menu. Bad experience in this place.
52,Calle Ocho, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The napkins are bigger than the tacos. But what‚Äôs there is very tasty! Definitely worth it on taco Tuesday.
