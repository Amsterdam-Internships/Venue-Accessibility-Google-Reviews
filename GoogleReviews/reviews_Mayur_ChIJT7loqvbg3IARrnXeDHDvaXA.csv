0,Mayur, 5 stars ,a month ago,Mayur cuisine has opened for over 38 years in this location. Over this time it is safe to say the food present is nothing less of perfection. Each meal has a particular blend of spices to fit its medium. The restaurant offers a variety of ‚Ä¶

2,Mayur, 1 star ,a month ago,The prices are high for the colored food that they offer. The taste is off even though some dishes look a little more authentic. Hate eating this kind of indian food as I'm from India. ‚Ä¶
3,Mayur, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Owner was magnificent along with attentive service staff. The food was fabulous and fresh. The Naan bread was phenomenal. Assisted with pairing wine for our dinner. It is rare for us to have such a great experience and welcoming conversation in a new experience. Highly recommend.

8,Mayur, 2 stars ,3 weeks ago,The chicken was dry and tough and the shrimp was rubbery.  Food was expensive.  Still looking for a good Indian restaurant.

10,Mayur, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"The food isn‚Äôt worth the price. Nice vibe, great service but far from what I was expecting. I‚Äôve paid half of what I did there and got twice as good food elsewhere."
11,Mayur, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Everything was amazing and this is the best Indian food I've had in years! We came very hungry and left more than satisfied. The garlic naan is to die for as well as the masala.

13,Mayur, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We stopped by here randomly because we were so hungry and totally lucked out. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious -  Chicken Tikka Masala, Bartha, Lentil Soup, Saag, and Mango Lassi. We especially loved the Tikka which had a ‚Ä¶"

26,Mayur, 3 stars ,a year ago,"I like the place, but it is too expensive for what you get. The lamb Vindaloo was perfectly spiced, however the meat was a little overcooked. The vegetarian curry was quite poor, the sauce was bland and salty. Having to pay $6 per person for plain white rice is just a complete ripoff."
27,Mayur, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I don't normally get excited about restaurants but this is my new all-time favorite Indian restaurant. The quality of everything was awesome. Tasty. Tender. Attractive. Seasoned perfectly. The owner/hostess is an absolute gem, helping with ‚Ä¶"

29,Mayur, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this restaurant!!  Each summer I return to Corona Del Mar and this is my first stop.

I look forward to seeing you in the summer!"
30,Mayur, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I eat every week from Mayur. I have dined in at the restaurant and got the food delivered home too. I was happy with both types of services. The food is delicious. I specially like the way the desserts are served. The owner is a great lady who ensures that every thing is on point.
31,Mayur, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I like this spot! They serve excellent food, they have a nice menu, The cook in that spot is very trained, I enjoy a lot eating all their food. The dishes are consistently of high class, the attitude towards the clients  is very good too. I often go to  this restaurant and I not even once was discontended. I recommend it to all."

34,Mayur, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I live in Illinois but have relatives in Newport Beach. Every time I visit I request to eat at Mayur. The food is always amazing. The owner speaks to you and sincerely wants to know about your experience. I highly recommend checking out Mayur even if you are unsure if you will like Indian food or not!
35,Mayur, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Not sure at all why the bad reviews! My family has loved this place for many years and we are here tonight.  The service won't kiss your ass, but they do a great job and make no mistakes, are considerate and precise.  The food is the best ‚Ä¶"

37,Mayur, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very good food, and a little different than many other Indian places. It is certainly among the best Indian food I've had. It did not have that taste and feel of ethnic food that's been Americanized, not even a little bit. Perhaps that's ‚Ä¶"
38,Mayur, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I guess 1 is the minimum we can give here or else I would have gone for Minus 5.
It's the worst Indian place I have ever eaten. ‚Ä¶"
39,Mayur, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Simply great north Indian food.  Quiet, comfortable and very friendly staff and owner.  This is a big step up from most Indian food in this area.  Highly recommended; if you like lamb try the tandoori lamb chops!"
40,Mayur, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Chef Dharam Singh and Host Ms. Anju Kapoor - that is about the best combination in Indian Cuisine in ALL of my experience. I have had Indian Cuisine in every State in the USA, in Every Country in Europe and almost all the Major Cities in ‚Ä¶"

We decided to try this place after several disappointments last year as it was ‚Ä¶"
47,Mayur, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"A nice environment, friendly staff but the dishes we had tonight were a little bland. The Dal Makhani was really disappointing. (We've been before and the food was far more flavorful.) Perhaps we just chose the wrong evening?"
48,Mayur, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Yesterday was our first time we came to that place. But It is absolutely not the last. We had a good time with the courteous service, with the superb cooking and fine drinks and with the modest pay. We will no doubt return there again."

57,Mayur, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Service at the beginning of the meal was overly attentive, and by the end of the meal, it had fallen apart! The food was fine, but the price was on the hefty side. The decor was pleasant, and the beer is served in a frosty glass; however, I probably won't return."
58,Mayur, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there on a weekday. Their website says that buffett closes at 2.30 PM. We drove about 6 miles to get there at 2.15 PM. But the manager turned us away. When I asked him about the information on their website, he said the chef had left ‚Ä¶"
