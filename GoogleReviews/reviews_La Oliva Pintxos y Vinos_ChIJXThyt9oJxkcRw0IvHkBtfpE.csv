11,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We accidentally passed by this place looking for a restaurant to have a drink. I dont have high expectations of Amsterdam restos because a lot are tourist traps. However, this place is a gem! The broodjes are soooo goood. I normally get …"

They have a good selection of Spanish wines as well. The food is really good, and it is not too expensive. If going on a weekend night, I recommend making a reservation."
17,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice pintxos, the tortilla was really good. Overall, good food and service. A bit on the overpriced side, probably due to location."
18,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 1 star ,7 months ago,"I went with two of my friends for a Paella and Pintxos, it was a very disappointing experience. The Paella was partially burned and the amount not enough for three people. We wanted to give it back, but the Restaurant Manager would refuse …"

22,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,5 months ago,What a fantastic place. Food superb. Go there if you have the chance.
23,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 2 stars ,8 months ago,Used to be a very nice tapas place 10y ago but neither food nor service still lives up to what it used to be. Unfriendly service and mediocre dishes totally overpriced. Sorry but Amsterdam has too many options to choose from to go for …

26,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic Pinxo's restaurant in Amsterdam. Found this by chance whilst walking the streets of Amsterdam. This is well away from the main tourist area (thank goodness). Sat at the central shared table opposite the bar on a wet Saturday …
27,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious Basque food in a cozy ambiance. The service is really amazing. Make sure you reserve a table, because it is always busy."

30,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely day... Nice beer... Never tried the food.. Although it did look very nice
31,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"Good wine. But the menu was totally different from what we found on Google Maps - no tapas, tortillas or patatas bravas anymore. Which was what we came for. Also, I guess we were at the wrong table as the staff continuously forgot us."
32,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Cool cozy European atmosphere, with good non pretentious decor and an array of delightful looking tapas on the bar. …"

38,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very friendly service, great pintxos and wine selection on the menu, nice decor and ambiance."
39,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 1 star ,2 years ago,They charged us 6€ for a bottle of water we hadn’t ordered and they didn’t want to change it in the bill. The lady was quite rude. They wouldn’t serve us a jug of tap water either. They said they could only serve water bottles.
40,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Very up and down.  Service was very kind and hospitable.  Fit us in just prior to a busy night starting.  Were very friendly and accommodating of our (almost) 3 year old and her demands for a hamburger, which they usually only have on the …"

44,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Loved
45,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was decent, but easily the worst service I've experienced in the last year.  Though no one was mean or inappropriate, they also never brought menus, no one helped us get food, and we were ignored trying to pay our bill - three times. …"

48,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food here is superb! Good assortment of tapas, and the stake was the best one I've had for quite some time. Perfectly cooked with a wonderful blue cheese sauce. This restaurant is a must if you visit Amsterdam. Quite crowded on weekends so it might be a good idea to make a reservation."
49,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great vibe, good food and good service!"
50,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very professional and nice staff. The food is very unique and delicious
51,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is the best Tapas restaurant I have ever visited. An absolute gem in Amsterdam. Service was excellent, with our waitress picking amazing food and wine on our behalf. Rivals the best in Spain. Heartily recommend to all tourists and locals."
52,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and great service. There is a gentleman that works there by the name of Jasper. He is just simply amazing! One thing about eating great food is also being appreciated as a customer. Jasper has the flair & charisma, friendly & professionaI. Would recommend this place any day"
53,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Super friendly staff!!!
Sangria & Food is okay, but nothing special
Major minus points: it’s insanely expensive"
54,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We had lunch and had good food. Try there original burger! It is not big portion, but good size for me.
Also soup was great too. …"
55,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, staff and atmosphere. Managed to fit us in on a Saturday evening and we enjoyed the selection of pintxos, a tasty pumpkin risotto followed by chocolate mousse and panacotta. A great selection of wines too. Delighted with our first meal in Amsterdam"
56,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 1 star ,2 years ago,Really nice atmosphere and the food was great but the service not so much. Was waiting for more than hour for starters and almost 2 hours for mains. Have not tried the tapas but maybe only cava and tapas would be better option.
57,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Loved it, Great food!"
58,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Overall food quality was very good. The black rice starter was especially delicious. Dishes were also thoroughly explained to us in English, which is great when you're unfamiliar with the choices. …"
59,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food, the atmosphere, and the location are stunning. They were also kind enough to accommodate my mum with several allergies. I'm very grateful for their additional effort to make my mum's last night in Amsterdam really special."
60,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious, slow service"
61,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Fantastic food, service and atmosphere. Allowed enough time between courses to breath and enjoy the food, wine and hospitality. Not a huge menu but superb flavours ( spicy sausages/peppers, anchovy/peppers - starters and swordfish/eels, beef/blue cheese - mains). Would highly recommend!"
62,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Meh. We had the pinchos (tapas). It was ok, nothing to rave about. The venison delish. The mini burger was underseasoned. We got one plate we didn't order (a blue cheese dish, my partner is alergic to blue cheese so we definitely did not …"
63,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Small and cozy restaurant in beautiful Jordaan. All pinchos are delicious and always fresh. It’s getting crowded in the evening, better to reserve a table in advance. We usually go without a reservation and stay at the bar for few snacks and a good wine."
64,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best tapas I had in Amsterdam so far ! Very tasty and traditional, it is more expensive than in Spain indeed but considering the probably need to import all the ingredients it worth the treat :p"
65,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 1 star ,4 years ago,"On holiday in Amsterdam, was walking along looking for a place to eat, seen la Oliva and thought it seememed nice.... service was terrible, got soup of the day for starter cost 28.50 Euro for the three or them which at first I thought it …"
66,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent, one of the best spanish restaurant I've been.
It's not the typical one, instead they have a fancy and elegant way to serve the dishes but still they are full of their original taste. 100% recommended if you pass by."
67,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great pinchos  and great wine! i love the restaurant, is cozy and the staff is very friendly. The food is incredible but you need to go early if you want to be able to try the pinchos, as once they are gone they are gone! you can still …"
68,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I don't understand why this rating for the restaurant is so high, but our food experience was aweful. We Ordered sword fish for 25 euros a plate got one skewer of three pieces of fish that have seen better days. Potatoes were at least a day …"
69,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went here on a recommendation from a friend and I would pass on the recommendation in a heartbeat. I highly suggest going for the pinxos, their tapas style dishes. Split between 2 people, 6 different dishes was plenty. And save room for dessert!"
70,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great place! You will have fun there. Really good pinxos and nice wines. Smart and fast people working. You feal good here, like they realy want you there! Good job guys!"
71,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 1 star ,9 months ago,We didn’t get the chance to have our lunch. The waiter was awful and racist. Will not recommend especially if you are a poc.
72,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Thanks to Yvette and Alfredo this has to be one of my favourite restaurants in Amsterdam. Great pinxos (however large they may be).The  a la carte menu is also very diverse and hits all the right notes. The service here is excellent and well timed. I highly recommend the Verdejo.
73,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice Service, food ok, value you get for the money not great overall."
74,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 2 stars ,3 years ago,As a spanish I think that food is overall  disappointing. They are not using best ingredients and the cooking preparation does not help to bring rich flavours. Everything taste a bit flat. The staff was friendly and service fast. Summarising I won't recommend this restaurant as I was not impressed.
75,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, great wine & good vibes."
76,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Looks cosy, but service is bad and even slightly rude. The concept of eating pinxos is that you can pick like you want and eat it immediatly. But when you order a tortilla in this place you have to wait 15 min and you get a dry one. When I …"
77,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty tapas, especially the pintxos (small portions of daily specialties on bread) selected by the chef, which included incredible smoked fish in a dressing, portobello mushrooms, blue cheese with candied walnuts and grilled (not rubbery) octopus.  Service was marvelous!"
78,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good pintxos selection and nice vibe
79,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I find it difficult to give 5 stars but this place deserves it. Attentive, friendly service. Great atmosphere and the food is interesting and inspired. Good wine list too....of course everything is Spanish related."
80,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We had a fantastic meal at La Olivia! The restaurant was full and they kindly made space for us at the bar. We had excellent tapas and steak. The food was amazing and the service was impeccable.
81,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Rustic yet modern Spanish restaurants serving pinxtos and classic dishes such as tortillas, which my partner and I ordered. Great big slice served with bread and salad, but we wished we had waited 10 mins later when they started serving pinxtos, huge selection! They all looked delicious, will have to revisit to try them next time :)"
82,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 3 stars ,7 years ago,I am seriously considering selling stealth technology because the waitress couldn't see me. Had high hopes because of all the rave reviews. The tapas are effectively bruschetta with posh toppings and while nice were nothing to write home about. Lots of the dishes had mushrooms as well. Service let it down quite badly.
83,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We happened upon this cute spot while wandering around Jordaan and surrounding neighborhoods. Pintxos are always a treat, especially at lunch! We shared three pintxos between the two of us, and it was just the right amount of food. It was …"
84,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Rude and disrespectful waiter, to be avoided. We ended up changing the restaurant and eating elsewhere"
85,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great tapas place with big variety of delicious pinchos, nicely displayed at the bar. The service is good and there’s a person at the bar explaining the daily specials and pinchos. Cozy atmosphere."
86,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely food, great wine selection, very good atmosphere - the staff are so so friendly and helpful with the pinxo choices and the food is beautiful. I would highly recommend this gem."
87,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place and good food. However the hostess was not that nice, we waited for 20 minutes to get the menus. Tha rest of the stuff is really nice. The food is good but small portions and overpriced."
88,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Pixtos was excellent, loads of choice. Staff really friendly. Cosy restaurant for lunch or dinner. Mahoe on tap! Music was lovely too, sort jazz & soul adds to the meal. All rounder!"
89,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"From Starter to main dish or desert, all dishes served were delicious. Perfect for a mix of flavor. Reasonable fast service! Waitress entertaining and carrying well! Thanks for the good evening! Thx Marlean!!!"
90,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best ""Tapas"" bar in Amsterdam. They serve the bigger, more satisfying version of Tapa. So be bold and inquisitive. Via con dios"
91,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent friendly service. This is a Basque kitchen and I like the chef surprise Pinxcho menus. Very popular and busy só plan ahead with a table reservation.
92,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was fresh and tasted good, however the service was poor. For example, the staff were very rushed, unnatentive, and didn't seem to care about the customer's individual experience,  it felt like they just wanted to get to work and get out as quickly as possible."
93,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Good price. Nice food. Many types of tapas and you can also order starters mains. Large selection of Spanish wines too
94,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"Salads for lunch here are not great.  I had the manchego /walnut salad which came to me with half a spoiled and brown avocado on top of it.  With that said, the tortillas looked so much better and regret my decision.   The rioja and coffee …"
95,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome staff, and without a doubt, the best food I’ve ever tried in Amsterdam. Pretty much one of the only places I would recommend in Amsterdam to eat meat!"
96,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Well what can I say, very good service! Cozy place! Food kinda experimental and not a good result. But a nice place to hang out."
97,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Staff felt rushed and not concerned with the individual costumer's need. Food was mediocre especially considering they ask a high price.  You are better off spending your money elsewhere
98,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Some tapas are great, some are a bit dry (shrimp ones), great hearing a lot of Spanish people around, but the atmosphere could be a bit more tapas like. Is okay, but very far from what you would get in Spain"
99,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Good food, bad service."
100,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Probably the best Spanish/tapas place in the city. Love it!
101,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Good food. Wine was expensive. We ordered 3 cups of wine not especially good and it cost 27 euros. The price of wine in cups was not showed in the menu.
102,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Hands down the best place we ate it in Amsterdam. Great tapas and the absolute best service we received. Call ahead for reservations because they do get busy.

104,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a nice restaurant with good food, but it was more expensive than we expected. More fine dining than low cost shareable bites to eat."
105,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food & friendly service. Both the little tapas bites and the a la carte menu are delicious.
106,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Tasty and a great sortiment of pintxos. Great service. Nice athmosphere. Very recommedable for group dinner.

113,La Oliva Pintxos y Vinos, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious and beautiful. We shared some pinxtos - Basque sandwiches - and appetizers, but entrees also looked fantastic."
