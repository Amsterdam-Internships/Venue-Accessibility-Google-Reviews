0,Bam Boa, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,My husband and I spent the weekend in Amsterdam and this quaint cafe was just about a 3 min walk from our accommodation. It‚Äôs a very cute place and the canal view is beautiful as well. I deducted one star because we ordered a few things and ‚Ä¶
1,Bam Boa, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Love chilling beside the river with some food in the summer and get some tan.
The Korean chicken was okayyy. Looks good but tasted mediocre.
Beer was fine. ‚Ä¶"
2,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Super cool atmosphere on the Amstel with delicious food! We got the ceviche, salad, and Korean bbq bites. Lots of gluten free, dairy free, and vegan options, which are all labeled on the menu. Will be back!"
3,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Wanted to try this restaurant for a while and was not disappointed. The only problem is that we couldn‚Äôt try more things on the menu because we were too full üòÖ Food, service, drinks‚Ä¶all perfect! The decor is also pretty nice and cozy. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
4,Bam Boa, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"I‚Äôve been to bam boa quite some times now, I love their truffle fries and sangria! Service is a bit slow tho, but if u sit outside next the canals it‚Äôs pretty nice"
5,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great service and food. Really enjoyed the terrace in a beautiful, cold and sunny day. Make sure to make a reservation, they're usually full"
6,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Lovely and bright place with creative decor and - most of all - delicious food. I've had a fresh salad and truffled fries - yummy!
7,Bam Boa, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Cute place but food is average. Service was a but lacking, but could be due to shortage of staff."
8,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Nice location along the Amstel with both indoor and outdoors being nicely setup and decorated! Food is good and price decent taking into account all of the above. Super calm and kind people for catering... ‚Ä¶
9,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a lovely New Year‚Äôs Day brunch! Staff was welcoming and the space is so pretty. The mini a√ßa√≠ bowl was delicious and the steak sandwich was *chef‚Äôs kiss* and the vegan lemon cake is so, so, so good!!!! Will definitely return the next time I‚Äôm in Amsterdam ü§ó"
10,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really beautiful place and decoration. There are a lot of fish dishes but it's also vegan friendly. The food is good and the lemon cake was amazing. Lets not forget that the staff is really nice as well. I'll be back!
11,Bam Boa, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"The food, location and service were excellent. There could be better communication - on the website or menu - about the size of the food portions though. They are quite small. You may need to order at least three items to feel satisfied (dinner meal)."
12,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A very pretty place. Went here for lunch today. Made a reservation via the website which was already an aesthetically pleasing experience. Loved the table with the name card, also liked the reminder for the reservation via email. Little ‚Ä¶"
13,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I felt like I was in Spain when I ate here. On the amstel, prime location, and the food was a belter.
Great selection of dishes in a wide variety we thoroughly enjoyed. Definitely coming back!"
14,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,a year ago,Cosy atmosphere which is created by the well curated interior and vibes. The food is good to share so that you can explore all options possible on the menu. This place is vegan friendly.
15,Bam Boa, 3 stars ,a year ago,Great location and atmosphere. Reminds you to be somewhere tropical. Love it. The drinks and snacks are tasty and well presented. Only downside is the service. Have been there now several time and always kind of slow and not  paying great attention on their guests.
16,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Good place, good food nice atmosphere. If you're going on a sunny Saturday expect long lines. Other than that its great."
17,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Easily the best place in Amsterdam whether it be for a sunny drink on the terrace or a meal inside during winter !
18,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Beautiful place, delicious food and smiling faces. We had a wonderful time on the terrace watching the sunset."

20,Bam Boa, 2 stars ,7 months ago,I don't normally leave reviews but I'm quite disappointed with Bam Boa and can't let it go. ‚Ä¶
21,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Had a great time! Went there on a Monday night, but still the place was stacked. Really friendly waiters, great food, and a fantastic location overlooking the Amstel!"
22,Bam Boa, 2 stars ,a year ago,One extra star for location. The home made lemonade is merely a water with a squeezed lemon which was in very dirty glass. So the quality is bad...
23,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Lovely food, combination of small snacks, very tasty. Very kind services, all time smiling and helpful. Perfect location, open space at the rivier, lovely terrace."
24,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"I've been so many times to Bam Boa, and I keep coming back. Food wise, the menu doesn't have so many options, but what they have is delicious. The fish and seafood are always very fresh. Friendly service as well!"
25,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,a year ago,Super cool place especially for a sunny day in summer. The outdoor seating lets you sit at the bank of Amstel river. Perfect place to hang out with friends or colleagues after work. Good spread of food and drinks too. ‚Ä¶
26,Bam Boa, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"We ate out in the terras, the environment was nice but both the service and the food was scarce, we and everyone around us had to wait a long time for anything, but we blame this on just understaffed. The real problem was the food; 1) The ‚Ä¶"

28,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Delicious food. Friendly people. Nice service. Super great place!
29,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Ordered Christmas menu for today and what a treat it was! Delicious fresh oysters, ceviche, and a number of other dishes prepared with attention to detail. Including clear, step by step instructions for home preparation. Will definitely be a regular at this restaurant. Cheers..."
30,Bam Boa, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Amazing food but the service wasn‚Äôt great. The waiters were a bit rude. Would definitely go back for the terrace view and those fries though!

36,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Fine food with a beautiful view

38,Bam Boa, 4 stars ,6 months ago,We ordered fries that we did not even get. Delicious avocado bowl üëå
39,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,a year ago,A lovely place to sit outside and enjoy a appetizer and a alcoholic beverage. The Pork Belly Bao was delicious. I'd recommend bringing sunglasses on a sunny day. Especially if you go there during the afternoon the people watching of the rowing teams and standing paddle-board is always fun. Definitely a not so hidden gem!
40,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"I literally love this place ! The terrace is so lovely, looking at the canal. The staff is super nice and the food is delicious! I definitely recommend !"
41,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great view on the River, excellent food and nice Service"
42,Bam Boa, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Ordered the vegan bowl and it was a disappointment. Bulgur was sour ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è sweet potato was raw, and avocado was so dark it should have been thrown away long time ago. ‚Ä¶"
43,Bam Boa, 4 stars ,a year ago,"They have it well arranged at the moment with the corona, you have one way walking and a QR code you scan and order you food and pay. You can then choose if they take the order to your table or you can pick up at the bar. The food is ‚Ä¶"
44,Bam Boa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice place to enjoy your sunny afternoon by the amstel. Even if there is no place to sit outside, you will not feel bad about sitting in because of their pretty decorations and light colour pallets. I enjoyed both their white and red wine ‚Ä¶"

46,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Good food, a cut above normal pub fare, right on the Amstel."
47,Bam Boa, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Beautiful location and delicious food, but I would not mind paying more for bigger portions (I had a ceviche amd it was ridiculously small)."
48,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,a year ago,Lovely place to have food with different types of dishes and a large variety. Portions are not too big and prices are a little above average but it's compensated by the great view and convenient location
49,Bam Boa, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great view and nice tapas to enjoy a romantic dinner or relaxing lunch with friends
50,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Love it! super cosy place and the heated terrace made our stay even better :)
51,Bam Boa, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"Great variation of dishes on the menu. Juices 10/10, go for the purple one. You won‚Äôt forget this juice experience!"
52,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice restaurant with a fine menu. The steak was good and the service was OK. I enjoyed the fact that they responded to the online reservation and we had our table reserved and prepared. The staff was also nice and helpful and always ready ‚Ä¶
53,Bam Boa, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"I took a sandwich. I found the price ridiculously expensive for what it was. The bread was not great and very small.
Staff was nice though."
54,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"They recently renovated and it is really nice. The music is good and the personnel is friendly.
Bam Boa also has a terrace next to the water, which is fantastic. ‚Ä¶"
55,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent in all details - cuisine, wine, atmosphere, service. The dishes are creative with intresting combination of flavours and textures. All food is originally plated. ‚Ä¶"

57,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was my first time yesterday to visit this awesome place really great spot for very nice food and drinks, the service more than perfect the waitress have the perfect smile and welcoming for us. Would come back again as the food was really good."
58,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Their Amstel-side terrace is one of the best, even in bad weather. Great food and coffee too!"

67,Bam Boa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place for breakfast with a beautiful view! Food is tasty. They use a pepper straws instead of plastic, which is good! If they  would serve eggs for breakfast it would be great üëçüèº"
68,Bam Boa, 1 star ,2 years ago,SUPER BAD Service.  We order a desert with an ice cream. the cream melted  and the lady didn't come yet with the spoons we asked for another ball of an ice cream but we left because it took her 35 min and when we asked her she said she forgot without apologizing or offering anything.
69,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very nice terrace with beautiful views, tasty food and great service."
70,Bam Boa, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Its a nice spot. Price/quality not a match. Small sizes, Amsterdam prices and no water next to your coffee/wine. A BamBoa waterbottle.... Food is nice but gets cold very quickly."
71,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great spot right by the river. It feels more like Ibiza than Amsterdam. Cassava chips were delicious.
72,Bam Boa, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I reserved for 3 people, but when I came there he told me that there only was table for two... I sadly had to wait. The menu seemed nice and tasty. but we got very small portions and when you add it all up it gets very expensive."

77,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,a year ago,Bam Boa never disappoints ! Great food and decor. Also nice for a quick takeaway coffee
78,Bam Boa, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Taste of the Food was okay. The concept was that all portions should be sharef. We oerdered 6 dishes. None of those were a dish that can be shared... very strange indeed...
79,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice Portuguese restuarant with lots of different tapas like little disehs. Excellent terrace next to Amstel river. Good service. They speak Dutch, and English."
80,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"My favorite place on the Amstel. Friendly staff, great vibe and good prices."
81,Bam Boa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place along the Amstel. Good and friendly staff. Food is little pricy and few selection of draft beers. But very good for a sunny day
82,Bam Boa, 1 star ,2 years ago,Staff saw me arrive. I was told to go to the bar to see if there was an available table. There was a vacant table. I was told it was reserved but there was no reservation sign. Very disappointing since I had been there a few evenings ‚Ä¶

85,Bam Boa, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nicely decorated, but very very slow service. Had to remind them several times to get my order. The place was understaffed, especially with seatings across the street by the canal."
86,Bam Boa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,beautiful terras but you can't get normal  Amsterdam tapwater  with your glass of wine. I hate that. Only high priced water. Ridiculous.
