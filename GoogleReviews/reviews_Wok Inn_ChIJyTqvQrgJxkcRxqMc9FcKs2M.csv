0,Wok Inn, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"I do like this place, open from 11am to 3am which is great especially in Amsterdam. Fast service and tasty food... only down side for me is I always seem to pay a different price eventhough I ordered the same thing on 3 different occasions. Seems the price depends on who's working I guess."
1,Wok Inn, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Good food, eat allot for less, the staff don 't speak dutch."
2,Wok Inn, 5 stars ,2 months ago,... very nice meal we had in the Wok-Inn and enough places to sit and very reasonable price (we are Dutch he)...
3,Wok Inn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Food was delicious and great price. they were open very late in the night. I ordered the #1 no meat. It was the best! Highly recommend! The location is tiny. Cook spoke english and about 7 other languages.
4,Wok Inn, 1 star ,2 years ago,The price shown on the board is only your noodles. My basic stir fried noodles came to ‚Ç¨16. And a can of coke cost ‚Ç¨3. It's a total rip off
5,Wok Inn, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Very delicious Noodles with a great taste.
I Love it üëç"
6,Wok Inn, 3 stars ,2 years ago,i really enjoyed the food;but the staff wasn‚Äôt that friendly .... :/

10,Wok Inn, 1 star ,2 years ago,"DO NOT GO!!! Worst experience from my Amsterdam visit. Extremely rude staff and mediocre food!  The owner forgets one of the food orders & coffee. After a long wait, when asked to cancel, he started behaving arrogantly!! Wish google had ‚Ä¶"
11,Wok Inn, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely wonderful experience with undoubtfully some of the best food ever to be served to both myself and my dining companions. Every aspect of this restaurant is planned and perfected: the splendid, intimate but spacious location, the excellent table service, the food. Definitely a favorite. Well done to chef and his team."
12,Wok Inn, 1 star ,10 months ago,"The noodles advertised on the board aren't the noodles that you get.
They advertise thick egg noodles but instead you get thin dry noodles. It is cheap, so I guess you pay for what you get."
13,Wok Inn, 1 star ,2 years ago,"SCAM!!!

15,Wok Inn, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Was charged ‚Ç¨16 for a medium sized carton of vegetable fried noodles with cashews, sweet baby-corn + Onions + peppers with medium spicy chilli. Came out of there not knowing if I got ripped off or treated fairly. The atmosphere was very robotic and the food took awhile to be served. Will probably not go here AGAIN."
16,Wok Inn, 1 star ,3 years ago,"To summarise below:
These guys will exploit you by charging you double whats advertised. We choose two meals costing ‚Ç¨17.80 and got charged ‚Ç¨26!! Cat with visible fleas roaming ‚Ä¶"

18,Wok Inn, 2 stars ,4 years ago,We went to Wok Inn twice in the last few days and on our second visit I can only describe it as being a massive tourist trap and rip off. Let me explain.... ‚Ä¶
19,Wok Inn, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Cheap tasty food. Expensive drinks.
20,Wok Inn, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"So good! Everything is delish and plentiful portions, made to order and right in front of your eyes. The owner is real nice and fun to chat with when it's not busy.  Menu is straight to the point and simple which makes ordering simple! Recommend Wok-Inn."
21,Wok Inn, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"There is a special term ""ÈëäÊ∞£"" in Cantonese (""Wok-hei"", literally ""Breath of the Wok"", referring to the steam produced during stir-frying in high heat, and then fragrance and taste of the food will be kept well since Wok-hei appears), and I ‚Ä¶"
22,Wok Inn, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good deal and big tasty portion. Its halal.  Order my food and within less than 10 mins my food was ready. Every time I visit Amsterdam this is one of the place I will always go to. üëåüëç
