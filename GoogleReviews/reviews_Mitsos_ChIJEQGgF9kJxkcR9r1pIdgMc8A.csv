14,Mitsos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is top-notch! It has everything a Greek restaurant needs: a variety of good starters, decent, home-cooked and (in my eyes) authentic main courses,  gentle Greek music playing in the background and a chef that appears to be in it with all her heart."
15,Mitsos, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Absolutely excellent, 100% authentic Greek cuisine. Go for the food, return for the lovely owners (and the ""wear a jacket! You'll get a cold!"" comments üòÇ)"
16,Mitsos, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Most delicious Greek food in town with products (e.g. honey) brought directly from the island of Crete.
17,Mitsos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best Greek restaurant outside of Greece. Delicious food and friendly staff. The restaurant itself is small and Cody which adds to the experience. It's almost like you are a guest in the kitchen.

23,Mitsos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This Greek restaurant knocked my socks off!!! You can get warm pita bread, stuffed aubergine/paprikas, the moussaka is to die for and then reincarnate as a Cretan. I am not joking."
24,Mitsos, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Perfect place to taste Mediterranean food. Owners (family run business) are extremely friendly and helpful. You can find really tasty mezes (tapas in Spanish term) along with the food.
