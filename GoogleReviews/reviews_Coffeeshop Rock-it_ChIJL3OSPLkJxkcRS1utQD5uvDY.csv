0,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 5 stars ,2 months ago,So I have been to Amsterdam about 8 times and this place is somewhere I always go too! English owner I think well there was a cockney gent who ran it the times I‚Äôve been there :) nice enough guy and the weed is NEXT LEVEL like I mean NEXT ‚Ä¶
1,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 5 stars ,3 months ago,I went a few years back now... I'll never forget to taste of the sour apple diesel you guys sold... nothings come close since
2,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great service, fast and easy. Owner seems nice too"
3,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good shop!!.. amazing strains! This is the best / only shop to get your Apple Sour diesel! ‚Ä¶
4,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Avoid this place at all costs, staff were very rude, arrogant and unwelcoming. Awful atmosphere, feels like you‚Äôre smoking in a kebab shop. Forced to purchase overpriced drinks if you want to smoke inside. Lighting is blinding, Interior design is unforgivable and seating is archaic. Overall dead vibes."
5,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Visited this coffeeshop during our trip to Amsterdam. Easily found with the bright sign and once instead there is seating upstairs, in the back and outside. The smoke is decent and quite cheap, would have liked more drinks options but that's me being picky. Staff are patient and quick to sort out problems."
6,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff, wide variety and great music. Theres an upstairs with a wide view of the market through the window üëå"
7,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A nice ambience and a warm welcome is what we experienced. A great menu selection to choose from, prices are average for Amsterdam. It‚Äôs in a prime spot with easy access to it by tram and metro. Sitting by the window, enjoying a nice smoke with my love...what more does a girl need? Some good coffee would be a start ü§£ü§£"

11,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Cash only. Really nice raggea music being played and the weed is good. If you want to stay inside you must also purchase a drink. I enjoyed my stay.
12,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"All my friends got excited telling me they found the best green in dam , referring to this cafe and the strawberry kush, and the Apple kush. So I went and checked it out.. Rubbish! It was some amnesia sprayed with some flavouring it tastes ‚Ä¶"
13,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 1 star ,6 years ago,"THIS PLACE IS DISGUSTING! You should only buy cannabis from here if you love lung damage. They sell SPRAYED weed, especially the Sour Apple Diesel crap. DO NOT BUY CANNABIS FROM HERE UNLESS YOU ARE STUPID! They are taking advantage of ‚Ä¶"

18,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 1 star ,4 years ago,"By far the worst coffeshop in AMS.  Shop owner is a known local crook peddling overpriced product to support him and his boyfriends (also works in the shop) other addictions. The prebag and spray the product with potpourri, etc.   Go next door, way better."
19,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Hmmm.   The budtender was not friendly insisting that I purchase weed as all I wanted was a coffee and to finish the smoke from Coffeeshop Marresa.  I did and enjoyed the smoke in front of the historic Wagg
House."
20,Coffeeshop Rock-it, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The service is awful. You can smoke your weed that you‚Äôve bought at this guys only in case, if you are going to buy some drinks at this coffeeshop. FUUUUUU! ‚Ä¶"
