0,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,"While the waiters are very polite and location and decor is very nice and cozy (romantic, even), the slow service undermines it all. In short, the food is tasty but way overpriced for the portions, the food service is slow and …"
1,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Its one of our fav places (we’re locals) but the new staff is somewhat clumsy (orders tend to be forgotten / messed up). But overall, great location and ok coffee. Snacks are really good!"
2,Meneer Nieges, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Great view and location. The garden outside looks ideal for a summer night and the decor inside is pretty. Food is pricey but okay. I've been here twice and each time it was so loud, I left with a headache. Wouldn't recommend if looking for a quiet and relaxed ambiance."
3,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Nice location and friendly staff. The dishes were nice but I expected a little more. It’s not cheap so you expect good quality produce. The steak tartare wasn’t cut properly and me and my friend both ended up with large strings of meat. The …
4,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,4 months ago,French orientated menu. Price/quality/size ratio is not great. Waiters aren’t well trained. Sad to see a growing amount of places in Amsterdam like this: clearly not for the love of gastronomy and creating something special but instead aiming to be as profitable as possible. Not recommended.
5,Meneer Nieges, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Food and location nice but they have no clue how to offer good service. Ordered snow crab and in the terrace was extremely dark, to be able to eat it. When expressed my disappointment to the waitress that they should provide more light or …"
6,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really cute atmosphere and friendly service. My friend and I had oysters and burrata to start, and a couple cocktails. They dont have much of a cocktail list just a list of the liquors the carry, and they have some beer and wine. For the …"
7,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"€9.50 for smoked salmon toast??? This would've costed three times as much in New York! I'm not used to getting such large portions of salmon on my toast, I was actually full from the meal. It's been five hours and I'm still thinking about that salmon. What a great brunch."
8,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,3 years ago,After two years living in the middle east I never thought I could find the same level of food than I could have in Amman. This place proved me wrong... probably the best shawarma / hummus you can find in Amsterdam. May be netherland... …
9,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Francy drinks by the river. Super cosy place! There is also a fire in the room and a huge terrace for the summer. Interesting furniture and I really liked the idea of placing a photo boot at the entrance. Fair prices.
10,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, great ambiance, before going for dinner visit the EYE museum to enjoy a different view from Amsterdam. Service can be hectic, prices are ok, be sure to make a reservation for the weekends."
11,Meneer Nieges, 1 star ,6 months ago,Bad restaurant. We order the Cote de bœuf 700gr. It was full of fat and not even 700gr. Fries were cold. We had to wait more than 1 hour between the straters and the main menu. Too expensive for what it is. They should change the cooker!!!
12,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"They sure tried but - while half empty - service was struggling and forgetting items, cutlery, ketchup etc. …"
13,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"High quality ingredients and local dishes, focused around seafood."
14,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice spot, but don't order food. Although quality is good, you don't get enough for the money paid. The is the main course for 14 EUR. One leave of lettuce and 2 small pieces of meat."
15,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"The view is nice. The meals are pretty small for the price you pay. The chrimp cocktail that cost 15 euros are 2 table spoons of Dutch chrimps with some cocktail sauce, servers forgot our drink order 2 times. I took like 20 minutes before …"
16,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tonight I've had my birthday dinner with my parents at Meneer Nieges. They've definitely earned the five stars. The service was perfect, very nice people, the food was amazing, beautiful plates and tastes. Very nice, especially for these prices. I'll be back."
17,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"It has a big terrace both with shade and without, our group had kaassouffle, bitterballen and croquettes as appetisers and  there was a variety of ""cold and hot dishes""  to choose, ranging from mozzarella, steak tartar, cocktail shrimps to …"
18,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place with nice view. I love the oyster a lot, very fresh and tasty. The portion is just perfect for me."

20,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Chill vibe and very good food.
Service is perfect and friendly"
21,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"You shall be waiting forever for the menu, and the bill. Coffee was good though."
22,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, great service. Small menu but executed very well. Quirky and fun atmosphere. I went in the winter so didn't get to experience it, but the outdoor seating would be great in the warmer months, with the water right next to the dining area, with great boat watching."
23,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I went with a larger group and we had a two-course menu; the food was great, but the overall ""choreography"" less so. Still, I like the interior design and vibe of the place, the staff was nice and friendly. Also, they have a photo booth."
24,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good cafe bar restaurant. Interesting interior design with some mirror panels on the ceiling and a lot of glass chandeliers. The food quantity isn't big. Nice location. They attract a young and energetic crowd.
25,Meneer Nieges, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Food was amazing. The service was ok an there is no englisch menu available.
Beside that 5 stars."
26,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a great restaurant/bar located next to the city center, in Westerdoksdijk. Ideal for going with friends, have some drinks, or celebrate a reunion. The terrace is beautifully lit, making it a perfect spot for spending a summer night …"
27,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Didn't experience anything like the bad reviews here - maybe a few bad apples? Had a lovely dinner with Christmas here. Everyone was real nice and sweet and the atmosphere is one in a million in this place, a real gem. Food was wonderful …"
28,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Australian friends and I dined here recently, and it was exceptional!
Nick and Maric were fantastic servers,
The food was delicious, and some of the best meals we had in Europe by that …"
29,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,a year ago,Outstanding service. Just got home after having some drinks here. The bartender was excellent. Really nice place. I forget his name it was like rook or something similar. Anyway nice place I would recommend.
30,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We went there on a sunny day.
There's a small menu with gourmet sandwiches. The one with ribs was very nice and the white wine was good. …"
31,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Here for a staff party. Food not as per agreed menu and of indifferent quality. Service attentive but there are many better places to eat within a few hundred metres. I'd give this a miss unless you want a beer overlooking the harbour. As the place is getting busier, staff are tripping over customers."
32,Meneer Nieges, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is very close to the central station and has some delicious but overpriced dishes on the menu. Especially during the summer time, this is a nice place to go to . The place has a great terrace along the water on which you can wine and dine near the IJ river. Go here for some drinks mostly - the food is pricey."
33,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,a year ago,"2 stars for the nice location, but really bad and slow customer service. Also there are three sizes for small beers but did not have glasses for pints. Will not come back."
34,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Lovely food and drinks are a served here. Had the lamb rump,  which was delicious. Seating is quite ""gezellig"" but cramped and uncomfortable after an hour and a half. It's a popular place and sometimes the kitchen can't keep up and you have to wait a but longer. Doesn't seem to affect the quality though :)"
35,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great atmosphere and great food! It's perfectly located on the water and you can sit outside of the weather is nice. I came with a group of 17 and they offered us an assortment of food from their menu for €19 per person. Everyone was happy!
36,Meneer Nieges, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It took 2.5 hours to get through 4 courses, and the worst of all: IM STILL HUNGRY! Portions are too small... And there were asparagus in 2 of the courses, I get is the season but isn't it a bit too much? Is 2 Stars + 1 for the atmosphere, really nicely decorated, and.nice service (although slow)... But that's it."
37,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very tasty gourmet dishes that aren't as pricey as you'd expect.  Portion sizes are on the small side, but that's a good thing as it allows you to try multiple dishes and have room for desert without commiting to one big entree.  I ate here …"
38,Meneer Nieges, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is very tasty, but service is not so good. Staff was way to stressed, and their energy influenced in a negative way. Also the main dishes are not so big, so you should probably always order a side dish next to it, because otherwise you will not have enough food."
39,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great spot with good food. The menu has original dishes ranging from vegetarian to meat and fish, all reasonably priced. Also for hanging out, the terrace is really well located right at water front of the IJ with view on the Eye."
40,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"food is really well prepared. although the WiFi channel they use to take orders consistently doesn't cover the whole exterior erea, the staff  has a friendly manner to deal with mistakes resulting from it. The place is down to earth, welcoming and really nicel designed, including the lightning."
41,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I had a chuck tender along with carrot puree, a side of fries and the friendliest server in Amsterdam. …"
42,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Nice restaurant in a great location.  Our company of three people left satisfied and satisfied
43,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We loved the dinner fish of the day, beets, and pumpkin; one of the best meal we had in Amsterdam! Not crowded and staff was very friendly"
44,Meneer Nieges, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Pitiful portion for average food however fancy price. Super noisy that you barely hear people next to you. But i guess Friday night is a bit inevitable like this..
45,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great place for evening drinks as well as lunch. Not very busy in the early afternoon and plenty of sunshine (only not untill very late). Prices are very reasonable but staff is a bit chaotic.
46,Meneer Nieges, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Only interested to make money. During the final of football world cup, they increased 4 times the price of beers. The picher usuallu at 15.5€, started at 18 to 24€ in 2 hours."
47,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Great location on the waterside. The appetizer, main dish and french fries were too salty. Priced too high. Waiters friendly."
48,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,a year ago,Great place for an afternoon drink or snack. Lovely vibe and view and quite hidden from sight.
49,Meneer Nieges, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Great location. Nice terrace over the Ij and good food. Rather pricey and small portions though.
50,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Place, ambiance, view were good, although food and (especially) customer service were pretty bad."
51,Meneer Nieges, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great terrace, but slow, unorganised service. Food is ok-ish; looks and sounds better than it tastes."
52,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Did not really like food or service ( to slow and chaotic) - it’s more for after work or lunch …
53,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I asked for a cocktail with ginger, got a weird look and a glass with apple juice with some bits of ginger."
54,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very nice food, environment and service"
55,Meneer Nieges, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Horrible service, waitress told us what to do 3 times, because they can't cover the basic services. Unfortunate for the nice location, completely destroyed by the waitresses."
56,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"In the warmest night of the century, stuff was attentive, with a smile, fast and sweet. We thoroughly enjoyed our time!!"
57,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Had lunch here and the food was really nice, plus the canal views are a nice touch sitting outside"
58,Meneer Nieges, 1 star ,3 years ago,"One star just because I could not give 0! Food barely decent, extremely long waits to get food more than one hour for the appetizers and more than one hour for the main course!!"
59,Meneer Nieges, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Small portions, food was ok, but, nothing special and all courses were really sweet in taste."
60,Meneer Nieges, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great ambiance. The terrace is quite big. Food is good as well

66,Meneer Nieges, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect for snacks, the view is great. Staff looks a bit unorganized."
