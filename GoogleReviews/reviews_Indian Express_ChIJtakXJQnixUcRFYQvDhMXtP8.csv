0,Indian Express, 1 star ,5 months ago,Normally a very good takeaway for Indian Food. But today I ordered a butter Chicken and I got something clearly from a can. Same taste as cheap tomato soup from the supermarket. Unbelievable that you deliver this and charge 17 euro.
1,Indian Express, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great Indian food in a shop run by a lovely family. All the plates are great and the meat is always cooked to perfection. I would reccomend this place over and over for a dinner at home with friends and family
2,Indian Express, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"FANTASTIC PLACE!!!

4,Indian Express, 2 stars ,11 months ago,"Yesterday we ordered take away for Butter chicken, saag chicken, chicken vindaloo, chana masala, tandoori roti, nan frm this take away restaurant.  It was totally tasteless. Vindaloo we took for our family member, who love to enjoy hot ‚Ä¶"
5,Indian Express, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place, been here many times as it used to be on my doorstep! Also used a few Groupons as they have good deals here too. After a decade I'm still struggling to find a proper Indian (same as what we have in England) as the cuisine varies here too much. I have to say the Garlic Nan bread here is the best I have ever had! So big also"
6,Indian Express, 1 star ,10 months ago,this used to be my go to place for my take away. i used to love their panneer tikka masala gravy. last few months i was disappointed with that dish. they now server just regular panneer gravy as panneer tikka masala. its not a tikka panneer ‚Ä¶
7,Indian Express, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We order almost weekly from this place  butter Paneer and some other vegetarian dishes. Their rice is excellent, the garlic nan is the best I ever had, and their curries are really very tasty! I think we will keep on ordering for a long time!"
8,Indian Express, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The food was amazing....I have never had such delicious Indian food in amsterdam..... I would recommend everyone to try this restaurant atleast once to have an experience which we had.
9,Indian Express, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"Food is great, delivery is horrible. Always late"
10,Indian Express, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best Indian outside of India you will find in the Netherlands for sure! The Chicken Vindaloo burns like it is straight from hell! But I love it! ‚Ä¶

14,Indian Express, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of our friends is a regular customer and he recommended this place, because he knows my family loves Indian curry. Last week we ordered the Lamb Massala, Butter Chicken and Chicken Korma and we loved it! The sauce was flavorful, thick ‚Ä¶"
15,Indian Express, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The menu did not show fried rice however the kind gentleman made me one which was tasty and such a big portion. I ordered the chicken jalfrezi, it was a little watery but once I dug down I found some sauce. The spice was very good, perfect ‚Ä¶"
16,Indian Express, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was delicious butter chicken , delivered fast, huge portions, we all just loved it! Thank you so much for it! And we 3 could not finish 3 portions so our host will have a free lunch tomorrow."
17,Indian Express, 1 star ,a year ago,"Please don't order here if you don't want to spend your entire night wondering when your food is finally going to be delivered. The restaurant is not particularly motivated to pick up the phone, and the staff will try to pin the fault of the delayed delivery on you."
18,Indian Express, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Indian Express lives up to its name: good curry, let's hurry!!"
19,Indian Express, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really great curry, at good prices for massive portions. Have ordered from here over 20 times easily and is our go to curry spot in Amsterdam. They do a really good prawn korma and lamb korma. Also garlic naan is delish! üêñ"

21,Indian Express, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Best Indian food delivery in the neighbourhood.  Delivery times during rush hours can be long and the use of spices may vary in time. But the quality of food is always excellent!
22,Indian Express, 4 stars ,9 years ago,I have ordered from here multiple times and it is usually very good and delivery is always fast. However yesterday I ordered the vegetarian korma curry which was way too sweet and made with frozen vegetables. What a disappointment after many good meals from here.
23,Indian Express, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I.m.o. (and I'm Indian) the best Indian takeout in Amsterdam. There's a small table for eating in, which is what I usually do. Great cauliflower pakora, saag paneer and chicken dishes."
24,Indian Express, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I ordered lamb tikka masala. The taste was ok but the amount of meat was surprisingly little. A LOT OF BIG PIECES of paprika and onion.
My girlfriend had the lamb korma which had a lot of sauce but also very little ‚Ä¶"
25,Indian Express, 1 star ,6 years ago,Horrible restaurant! I got my food delivered from here en the worst en most rude person delivered it at my door; never experienced such a thing. I've eaten Indian food my whole life in different restaurants/places and this food was way too ‚Ä¶

28,Indian Express, 4 stars ,3 years ago,vegetarian dishes are awesome. the non-veg ones have same problems as most other take-aways. getting quality meat for a reasonable price is impossible.

30,Indian Express, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The food is always delicious and the portions are huge. Can't understand the bad reviews I've seen. This place is solidly yummy and has been for years.
31,Indian Express, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Yummy food and decent sized portions, if you‚Äôre willing to wait 1 1/2 - 2hrs for it. That‚Äôs unfortunately the average waiting time of our last 3 orders during the weekend."
32,Indian Express, 5 stars ,a year ago,Up there with the best Indian food in Amsterdam. Unapologetically authentic and spicy - the way it should be!

35,Indian Express, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The order came with missing items, I called them, they told us it would be delivered in 25 min but they never delivered. I don't even want my money back, just the honesty of calling me and telling me they would not be able to deliver today. ‚Ä¶"
