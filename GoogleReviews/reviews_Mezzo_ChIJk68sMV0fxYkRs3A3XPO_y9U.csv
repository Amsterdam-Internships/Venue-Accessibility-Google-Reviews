1,Mezzo, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Great Old Forge style pizza, I think it's my new favorite! Great onion flavor from the sauce but it's minced very fine (which I like). Also had Chicken Parmesan which was also very good and nice portions. Nice beer selection and draft ‚Ä¶"
2,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Great Italian  food, large portions and very good prices..  An A+ from us.."
3,Mezzo, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Lizza's is one of my favorite restaurants. They have great menu options, their pizza is excellent, and the Skeeter wings are phenomenal! You can even order your pizza unbaked if you don't plan on eating it immediately. 100% recommend."
4,Mezzo, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"We absolutely love lizzas food its really good! The shrimp and hot peppers pizza is my favorite but they have good wings and burgers too! Everything I've tried from them is really good, and the waitresses are always friendly and nice!"
5,Mezzo, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Good Old Forge pizza. I usually put it in the oven to get it a bit more crispy but otherwise it's spot onüëç
6,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Professional staff, clean establishment, great pizza. A+"
7,Mezzo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is pretty good. We used to order the stromboli special every Thursday at work. However, due to one experience I will never order from here again. We spent almost $70 on lunch one Thursday. One of them was delivered incorrectly. A ‚Ä¶"
8,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I like it here. Service and prices are great. Kinda cool that you can order a beer with your meal here. Small intimate bar if you are alone or with a small group and just want some privacy. Many of the patrons are locals and often you tend to see someone you know, which I enjoy. Try the Stromboli‚Äôs üòâ"
9,Mezzo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Our waitress Chrissy. She was bubbly and very efficient. We will return
10,Mezzo, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Atmosphere was nice. Pizza was good but perhaps to cheesey.
11,Mezzo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I placed an order with Lizza's Mezzo Mezzo's for Sept 25 the. Order was ready on time, the guy that worked there carried the order out to my car for me.The food was delicious, and service was excellent ! Great job and thank you !"
12,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great pizza.  Good beer selection including 6-packs to go. Also have great salads and a nice dinner menu.  Relaxed casual environment.  Friendly staff. Everything is made fresh to order.
13,Mezzo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"First off , I was told that my order would be ready in 40 to 45 minutes. When I arrived 30 minutes later to wait for my order, the food was cold.
Bringing the food back home, the pizza was okay. ‚Ä¶"
14,Mezzo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Always like to support local business but have to say....ordered a tray of shrimp pizza with hot peppers.  Shrimp were the little pink ones out of a can that look raw and bananas peppers with a crunch you just don‚Äôt want on a pizza. Also got a hoagie which was very good. Unfortunately 30 bucks for a hoagie. Couldn‚Äôt eat it.
15,Mezzo, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great service, great food, waitress was super friendly with a pretty smile"
16,Mezzo, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Fast delivery and love the square pepponi pizza and everything on the menu i have tried so far, I love the pizza the best!"
17,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I have a favorite the The Grilled Chicken Panini... 35 to 45 minutes for tbe order but so worth it and there pizza is also really good i prefer to get it uncooked and put in my own oven and last of all the skeeter's (sweet&spicy)chicken wings is just great to smash down a dozen of em #awesomefood
18,Mezzo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"There was 4 of us in our party
When we arrived saturday night at 4:50pm we were the second table. We placed our order and waited until 6pm for our food which was not the correct order when we received it. Missing items and wrong food. Terrible service. Never again!!! Take out okay."
19,Mezzo, 5 stars ,a month ago,The best food for delivery!!!
20,Mezzo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Some of the tastiest pizza in the Pittston area.  The staff are all nice and there's a love for Superman inside which is always a bonus.  The one negative is on busy times give yourself some extra time to find a parking space when stopping there to pick up or eat in as the parking is rough around there.
21,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Luv the boneless bites...honey garlic. Service is great. Parking is not always easy...often circle the block a few times to search for a space. Great casual stop.
22,Mezzo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Chicken wings were good; however they have been a little more spicy. The square pizza was okay. Kind of bland. Overall nice atmosphere and good service.
23,Mezzo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Well this is now easily mine and the family's and friend's favorite üçï hands down. I ordered it because they were the only place that would deliver here. So glad I did. They also have a nice little bar if you have to wait for pickups.
24,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, their pizza is amazing and their wings are fantastic. I recommend you try the Skeeter sauce if you order wings, prices are reasonable too."
25,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great pizza, their food is great and the service is superb.  The prices are   very feasible.    Go there at least 2 to 3 times a month"
26,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,As long as you can find a parking spot the pizza is SO WORTH IT! Friendly staff and the interior is cool with retro photos from your favorite Italian actors.
