5,Piqniq, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We had a very good lunch at PIQNIQ on Lindengracht during our recent visit to Amsterdam. Opening hours 9am to 5pm daily. ‚Ä¶
6,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely cafe on a quiet street of Amsterdam - choose 2, 3 or 4 small dishes to have with a coffee, juice or tea. Great way to try several different types of food at once! For a very reasonable cost too! Beautiful presentation of the food was also a bonus! Highly recommended!"
7,Piqniq, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Vegan friendly. Amazing soups. Fresh and joyful.
8,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Portions are maybe small but for that price it‚Äôs ok!
Very very tasty!!"

10,Piqniq, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I went there for breakfast but then since i was working on a project with my friend, we stayed for lunch as well. It was cosy and i liked the decoration and interior design. What was a bad point to me is that the concept of serving small ‚Ä¶"

12,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We were looking for a place to have simple and good food in this very touristy area of Amsterdam. The place was full when we arrived but we decided we could wait 15 minutes to get a table. We were not disappointed, the atmosphere and ‚Ä¶"

14,Piqniq, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great food and customer service, soup is great (and I'm normally a non-soup person hehe) and quality of everything is amazing! Went with my partner and just followed the suggestions given by the staff, who provided a great service."
15,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good gluten free options, you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre compromising on taste at all. We sat outside because the inside was full, they were really busy so we had to be patient on service, and it was worth it. Very cute market right by the cafe, as well, with foods, gifts, clothes, etc."
16,Piqniq, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This cafe seems to be family run. The staff is unbelievably kind and the food is really great. We ordered a pancake, sandwich with salmon and breakfast eggs - the staff asked us, if we wanted the eggs boiled or scrambled. The eggs were ‚Ä¶"
17,Piqniq, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Delicious food, perfect portions, super tasty cakes! You can have the gluten free option for the bread and the gluten free/lactose/sweet option for the cakes. Lovely place!"
18,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Pulled chicken sandwich was amazing. Also the Brie special and the farmers cheese sandwich were great .. didn't love the salmon sandwich too much. The staff is very friendly and accommodating! Highly recommended!
19,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Love this place for breakfast! I ordered the American breakfast and I liked how they cooked the bacon (crispy but not too salty) and scrambled eggs (with mozarella!). The doughnut was amazing too. They have a chill cat by the window which ‚Ä¶

21,Piqniq, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This place deserves its rating. Nice location, very pleasant staff (who speak flawless English) and excellent food. I highly recommend the pulled chicken sandwich if you do drop by."
22,Piqniq, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very good experience. Every sandwich, has different taste. This let's you travel to different places at the same moment. The price was also good 10.5 euros for 3 sandwiches and 2.5 euros for cheese cake. I will diffinitly recommend it  to my friends newt time."
23,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely breakfast place. We ordered the American and PIQNIQ breakfast. Generous portion. Oh and they have a cute little resident cat that will laze beside you while you eat.
24,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome place for eating delicious gluten-free food! Staff really knowledgeable, they give you a small woodblock on your table saying ""gluten-not for me"" so that every staff member know you are coeliacüòéüëå felt very safe, and the food was delicious and well prepared ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
25,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Another highly rated cafe that deserves it. We came here actually as a second choice as the queues were getting longer elsewhere, still queued here but only 10 minutes or so. Missed breakfast so had the lunch menu which has a great concept. ‚Ä¶"
26,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic place, we‚Äôve came across this place while watching a video on YouTube and we said immediately we have to go there! Let me tell you didn‚Äôt disappoint me whatsoever! Superb food different flavours and combinations of ingredients that I never thought they matched so well. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing! Can‚Äôt recommend enough!"
27,Piqniq, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Glacially slow, seat people out of order, reservation means nothing.

The first time we tried to go, they took so long (20+ minutes) to get to us it ‚Ä¶"
28,Piqniq, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious breakfast! After walking by yesterday and seeing the menu, we went for breakfast today. For drinks we had the orange, cinnamon, ginger tea (love that there are made with fresh ingredients) and a latte macchiato. Both came with a ‚Ä¶"

30,Piqniq, 5 stars ,7 months ago,It‚Äôs a very cute cafe with nice sandwiches ü•™ and delicious coffee ‚òïÔ∏è
31,Piqniq, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Not a bad place for breakfast but also nothing special. The donut was very nice but other than that the variety is very limited and nothing you can't find in any other place.
32,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A great idea. Small sammiches, salad, quiches even a picnic selection you can preorder to take to eat somewhere else that's just as nice. You choose how many items you want, as they charge by 2, 3 and 4 items per person. Then you tell them ‚Ä¶"
33,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A small resturant with nice staff, best orange juice I have been tried till now in Amsterdam. And for me it‚Äôs a first time to try Apple Cinnamon Waffle but it was very good üëçüèª.. ‚Ä¶"
34,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best breakfast and/or brunch places in Amsterdam.. The eggsalad sandwich is to die for and you must try the beet juice.. A piece of heaven.. Loved it!
35,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came here with a friend for lunch and I love the concept because I wanted to try everything on the menu and because the portions are small...you practically can! I took one of the almond tarts to go as well and it was delicious! Definitely a great place for a casual bite.
36,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food and staff are amazing. I highly recommend it; you will not be let down. 90% of the items on the menu had a gluten-free option.

43,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely little cafe. Amazingly frothy cappuccinos. I had the Dutch pancake, very good. Highly recommend"
44,Piqniq, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Unbelievably horrible service. We were given a dirty table, waitress said she'd be right over to clean it. She never did. Another couple came and sat down and was served before us. Seems like they discriminate against tourists. I recommend avoiding it."
45,Piqniq, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice breakfast place. Waffles and pancakes are good! There's always a queue outside since the place is smallish.
46,Piqniq, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice little place with good food.  They have good lunch deals.
47,Piqniq, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Perfect Location for a late Breakfeast in Amsterdam! Good Food, nice n friendly Staff. The only Situation that is not perfect is the missing Possibility of Reservations at the Weekend. But all in all, just nice!!!"
48,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful gluten free food - kind staff, affordable prices, overall enjoyable experience for our first time in Amsterdam."
49,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Busy place to get brunch on weekends but completely worth it. They have small portions but food is delicious and it's worth the wait because of a bit slow service. Overall, it was a good experience."
50,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food was so good. Loved the fact that you get to choose multiple dishes of small portion. Highly recommend the curry corn soup and PULL CHICKEN SANDWICH! It was the bomb

59,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best fine dining experience I have ever received in my 3 years here in Baton Rouge, hands down. I decided to take my girlfriend on a nice date here, after reading Yelp reviews. We had reservations, and were seated quickly. Our waiter ‚Ä¶"
60,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Cutest place in the city! Portions are perfect and everything is delicious! Walk-ins welcome but I would suggest a reservation because people love this place!

62,Piqniq, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Their plates are smaller but one can combine 2, 3 or 4 of them. This way, several flavors can be achieved."
63,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We‚Äôre gluten free. This was the  most deliciously delectable experience  - these guys takes sandwich/soup and salads to another level! No filling up on stodgy bread. ‚Ä¶

66,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious little cafe! I got the quiche, salmon, and hummus, and they were delightful."
67,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This was a refreshing meal from a very nice cozy restaurant.  The experience was very cool and the concept was good: pick 3 or 4 Items and get a smaller size of each.  Soups salads and sandwiches left us feeling ready to explore - not too heavy.
68,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wonderful neighborhood spot. Great food, reasonable prices."
69,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely little Cafe! Wonderful small plates to choose from.
70,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great! Had breakfast, it was good. Breakfast ends at 11.30am. Extras had a good price (salmon and avocado for 1 euro each). Capuccino felt a bit smaller by my standards but had a good flavor. They offer other types of milk for a small extra ‚Ä¶"
71,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very friendly staff! The give you some nuts with your beer with is extremely rare in Amsterdam. Not a lot of options but all of them very good.

75,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Consistently amazing! I‚Äôve taken many friends and family of mine here over the years. Service is consistently amazing, and the food small selection combos cannot be beat. You can blindly pick your option and it will be one of the best brunch / lunch experiences you‚Äôve ever had. Beware of a possible wait."
76,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place and nice concept.
The spicy chicken is really amazing"
77,Piqniq, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The gluten free options are a big hit in our Celiac household.  The sandwiches are the perfect size for us (smaller), and the Tuna is a big hit.  Also love the gluten free treats at the counter."
78,Piqniq, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place for a cozy bite to eat, either breakfast or lunch, or just a coffee break. It's tiny so you might not find a place if you come without a reservation."
79,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A hearty and tasty menu at a reasonable price. I recommend the panini with pulled chicken. The staff were friendly. The mulled wine was declious.
As a bonus point there was a very cute cat sleeping by the window next to our table."
80,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Literally one of the nicest breakfasts I've ever had. Situated down a beautiful, unassuming street not far from Centraal - i cannot recommend it enough. Really chill vibe and a sleeping cat. Love it."

82,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Stopped in for a brownie as I‚Äôd just had lunch elsewhere. It was delicious! And gluten-free!! Service was super-friendly, even though they were busy with a line out the door. This place is on my list for my next visit to Amsterdam."
83,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Such an adorable place! Healthy/tasty food. The cutest/tastiest hot chocolate I've ever had (Belgium chocolate with adorable instructions). The restaurant even has a friendly cat! Was very pleased with lunch. And the price was nice. :)
84,Piqniq, 5 stars ,a year ago,Lovely little cafe with interesting menu concept. Loved the food and the atmosphere. Great place for a breakfast or lunch. It might be good Idea to book.

87,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Came here for lunch and really enjoyed my meal here! Small portion food (per item) and you can mix and match to create your own desired meal, great value too! The service was also great! The place isn‚Äôt big however so you may have to wait for a table, but would highly recommend."
88,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I am so glad we found this great little restaurant on our last full day in Amsterdam.  It was the best meal we had on our entire three week trip to Europe!  Great service, too.  My husband was hesitant to try it due to the concept of ‚Ä¶"
89,Piqniq, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food in this small restaurant. Far from typical Amsterdam paths, this restaurant gives a great selection of small food (warm or cold) can you can combine as you want: very delicious! The waitress are very kind and the place is very nice. Strongly suggested"
90,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A small cafe with a tasty menu. Really fresh and modern. I ordered three small things on the menu and also had a dessert. It was just the right amount. However, it would not be suitable for fussy eaters."
91,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great cozy place. Nice atmosphere and kind waiting staff... the food was yummy.
92,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This restaurant had a very nice assortment of menu items. It was very easy to order, the items came quickly, the portion sizes were just fine. You could order two items, three items or four items. They let you know the portion sizes were ‚Ä¶"

The service is very friendly - the girls were super accommodating even though I kept changing tables (I was a bit fidgety this morning - shame on me!) :( I just wanted to move closer to Pedro, the lovely cafe cat! Had a delicious coconut yogurt with fruit. Very lovely and cozy!"
94,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Everything we ordered was delicious, and very aesthetic too üòÑ. Although they didn't have many vegan alternatives on the menu, it was easily modified for me which I am grateful for! My bf had ""regular"" food and loved his food as well."
95,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,What a find! Really lovely staff and very quick to serve. Food amazing - especially for us vegetarians. I ordered the 4 combo which was good for a hungry man. My wife had 3 and found it a good amount. Highly recommended.
96,Piqniq, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Offer gluten free food options. They were absolutely delicious. Really like their idea of having tapas sandwiches. Very unique. Great customer service and sat there all afternoon under the umbrella outside. Definitely recommend. Plus they have a cafe cat.
97,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,fantastic little lunch place...it's tapas but sandwiches and soup...very good tuna
98,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Different concept than anywhere in town. They have a few smaller portioned sandwiches, soups, etc that you can choose from and collect your perfect meal. Was never disappointed with their food but vegan option variety could be better."
99,Piqniq, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place where to have a nice breakfast/lunch. Food is nice and the prices are very affordable.
The service is also pretty quick. ‚Ä¶"
100,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Coquette restaurant. We had breakfast here, really good omlettes and fried eggs. The coffee was good, nice selection of tea bags and of tea with fresh ingredients.

103,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food and service, most of the food served is also available gluten free. As a celiac I can vow for the care they take in keeping the food contaminant free. The cafe is a bit small and sometimes there are queues outside the place but the food and service make up for that."
104,Piqniq, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice and easy place for lunch. The concept is that you can select 2, 3 or 4 small bites. The 3 bites option is perfect for you lunch if you are not a very big eater. Very easy going atmosphere."
105,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"So came here around 12 hoping for breakfast but they had stoped serving breakfast so we did lunch and im glad we did, it was amazing! They serve small portions so basically you can pick between to to four things on the menu, its kind of ‚Ä¶"

107,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place, tasty wholesome food, most of which can be done gluten free. Friendly staff and a neighbourhood cat that sat next to us and enjoyed our company. We arrived about 12.30 and waited ~5 mins for a table for 3. After this a larger ‚Ä¶"
108,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It's been weeks... my trip to Amsterdam has been long over and I dream of the sandwiches at Piqniq. Go with your babe and order ALL the sandwiches. Sounds crazy but they are small and delicious. Really really delicious.(the cheese sandwich gon make you feel some type of way) Our server was a sweet lady as well :)
109,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food was so flavorful and the waitress was very attentive. The food is smaller portions which I loved. The soup was so nice and comforting after walking around the cold damp city during the morning.
110,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,What a fab little place. Breakfast was yummy and they were very accommodating for lactose intolerant . They even made my daughter a soy cappuccino. I only wish we had time to have them make us a picnic lunch.
111,Piqniq, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Lovely lunch cafe. You can select a set of 2, 3 or 4 dishes (think, sandwiches, soups, quiches etc) and mix and match as you like. Good value, caters for small or large appetite."
112,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a very small restaurant but what it lacks in size it makes up for with great good and service. We were in Amsterdam for 4 days and had decided to try as much as we could but only once. We broke that pact by coming back to Piqnic ‚Ä¶
113,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very cozy and they have Delicious Sandwiches.
114,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Cute place with delicious food and excellent service. Quick too.
115,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"There's a cat, so. There's that.  Also, food is great. Wife and I each got the 4 item lunch (small but not tiny portions of different items) and were totally satisfied, despite being big, giant, gluttonous Americans. Very fair prices, too."
116,Piqniq, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Little cozy place with great soups and delicious bits. Waiters were very friendly. It is worth a try. The place is very small though. You may have to wait a bit for a table.
117,Piqniq, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food portions were not very big but it was nice tasting. Mostly 3 starts since the service was not good. Also got the feeling that they wanna leave as soon as you are done, the place is small so no time for cozying."
118,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cozy little spot to get some good food. I went for breakfast and had the French waffle with scrambled eggs. I also ordered a hot chocolate that was pretty cool because it was DIY. Chocolate on a stick that you stir into steamed milk.
119,Piqniq, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent place to grab breakfast. The fried eggs with tomato cheese bacon and toast was delicious. The fresh squeezed orange juice was also very good. Prices are reasonable and service very good.
120,Piqniq, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"3 stars. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad place. It is just... a little bit pretentious and pricey. Portions are not great but the food is good. Also that hipster interior decor is starting to become a little bit boring. Although I had the opportunity, I still have to go back which is not a good sign... -_-"
121,Piqniq, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Really chilled out place. We had a snack to keep us going here. Very lively and relaxed. The food and service were great. Definitely worth a visit if your in the area.
122,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went here for lunch, small cafe but well worth a visit. There is a nice choice of lunch options on the menu, and the food is delicious. Staff were also helpful and friendly."
123,Piqniq, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Fresh, healthful small bites. Most things on the menu are available gluten free. The owner and staff are unbelievably helpful and nice. ‚Ä¶"
124,Piqniq, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is alright but the service is extremely slow and they forgot not less than two of the four dishes I ordered. The gluten free offer is nice of course, but on the other hand they don't have any alternative to butter, like margarine for instance..."
125,Piqniq, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Lovely breakfast here with very nice service. Would happily go again. Menu has a good variety without overloading you with too much choice. Perfect.
126,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice and cosy place, small menu with interesting choices. Roast beef sandwich with truffle mayo and pumpkin soup is totally suggested! Friendly stuff and cool atmosphere!
Worth it for sure!"
127,Piqniq, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great little cafe for breakfast/lunch or high tea, we mixed and matched our own lunches and they had a number of gluten free options (including desserts!) Would definitely recommend for a relaxing lunch."
128,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My little brother and I made this our first stop after getting off our flight. The tiny sandwiches are a perfect way to try a bunch of different menu items for a smart, low price. Would definitely go back if I ever find myself back in Amsterdam."
129,Piqniq, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Airy, relaxed vibe for lunch. Friendly staff, lovely bold and fresh flavours with nice textures. Good value, great drinks menu too. 10/10!!"
130,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Had one of the best Chai lattes (ever) and I had many in my lifetime.

Ingredients are also Top notch and the soups here are A MAZ ING. Menu was simple ‚Ä¶"

133,Piqniq, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love the idea of this place! Choose a few items for a set price and you can mix & match. Delicious food, amazing service and very affordable."
134,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great pulled chicken focaccia, amazing flavors. very small portions, 2 choices for 6.50 euros :) lovely ambience, quiet and friendly"
135,Piqniq, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is really a hidden gem and soo good you actually want to keep it to yourself! The best food I've had in Amsterdam out of all three visits here, friendly staff that clearly love what they do and even a sleeping cat in the window. Well worth a visit!"
136,Piqniq, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"I'm giving it two stars because it wasn't until after I ordered my coffee that I realised they are using a nespreseo machine which cost ‚Ç¨3.40.
