7,Het Mandelahuisje, 1 star ,a year ago,"Bad quality reggaeton on the speakers of Mandelahuis? Disgraceful!, try Makeba to start with or any good music that match the place! I waited for the next song and the same,so I left, good music does not bother anybody, but reggaeton? For the Noord sunset? Really?"

On the other side of the IJ in Amsterdam Noord, so away from the busy streets and noisy city life, this terrace that is run by Dutch social entrepreneur and do-gooder Ilco van der Linde is an oasis of tranquility and peace. Only open when the temperature rises above T-shirt levels in summer."
