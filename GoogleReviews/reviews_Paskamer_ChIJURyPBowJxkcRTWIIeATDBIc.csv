1,Paskamer, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Lovely winebar with nice by the glass menu and great selection by bottle. Food was amazing and they serve a tasting tray with 3 wines. Nice service as well.
2,Paskamer, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Great wine bar with sunny terrace. Enjoyed oysters and rose for Mother‚Äôs Day, after taking the little one to the speeltuin across the street. Will definitely be back."
3,Paskamer, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful neighborhood eating spot. You need to check the avocados.

I have been back several times since my first visit and still love this place!"
4,Paskamer, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great option for a casual dinner with good wine. Burrata with beetroot was exceptional. Try the salmon and the octopus as well. Good wines at reasonable prices.

6,Paskamer, 5 stars ,a year ago,We did an online tasting with a group of 20 people. Wouter and team prepared everything lock-down-proof in sets per household. The tasting itself was really good: Wouter has a lot of theoretical and practical knowledge and he adapts to the ‚Ä¶
7,Paskamer, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a fantastic wine bar. Do not get fooled by its location a bit outside the main streets of Amsterdam (at least for a tourist): it is absolutely worth a visit: the food is top-notch, the wine is well selected, and its cozy and friendly atmosphere tops it all. Absolutely recommended (and allergy-friendly)!"
8,Paskamer, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing high wine. Delicious food paired with good wine. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Can highly recommend and will definitely come again soon!
9,Paskamer, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great hidden gem. Paskamer has a truly fantastic wine selection, offering beautiful bottles and vintages at amazingly friendly prices. Shared dining food is great, and if you give them a heads up, they prepare good vegetarian alternatives ‚Ä¶"
10,Paskamer, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We went for a glass of wine and what an awesome spot to find. I loved the sound of their menu - so will be back to try it out. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the different wines on their menu and was able to help us make a quick decision. Fun spot over all
11,Paskamer, 4 stars ,2 years ago,De Paskamer has a great selection of wines so I would definitely recommend taking the wine tasting or asking the staff for their recommendation. The dishes are tasty and of good quality but a bit overpriced in my opinion due to their small size.
12,Paskamer, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Went there on a Saturday night, you better book before as the place was fully booked. Because of many people, it was very loud inside and we were given two stools next to the entrance.... This already had a bad impact on the experience. The ‚Ä¶"

18,Paskamer, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Really delicious food and wine in a cosy restaurant. The staff could have been more attentive, but were very knowledgable and friendly.

23,Paskamer, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food & wine was fine! Service was not what one would expect. Waiter was sarcastic, moody and not hospitable at all... Wibe tasting is not suitable as diner option."
