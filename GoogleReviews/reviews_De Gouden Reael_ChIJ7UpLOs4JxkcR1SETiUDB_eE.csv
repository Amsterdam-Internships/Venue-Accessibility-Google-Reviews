0,De Gouden Reael, 4 stars ,6 months ago,It’s just an awesome place to eat! Everything you order is completely tasty and mouth watering. They have a wide variety of wines to choose from and different dishes of high quality ingredients. The desserts are really tasty. The staff is …
1,De Gouden Reael, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Overall more than amazing experience- incredible food- lovely ambiance- superbe staff- happy with everything!! Highly recommend the oysters, mussels, espresso martinis & the limoncello was the best I’ve ever had and I’m Italian.. 1000/10"
2,De Gouden Reael, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Update as the owner changed. During the lockdown we were lucky that we were able to try there pithivier (still on the menu btw) but this was the first time for a proper dinner here after the lockdown. Everything we ordered was well prepared …
3,De Gouden Reael, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Incredible evening here. Four courses with wine pairing, unique, delicious, and pleasing to all the senses. Extremely cozy atmosphere, and very friendly staff."
4,De Gouden Reael, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I love the place! The location is great (not in a touristic area, so you won’t get dizzy from all the people passing by). The waiters are friendly and know their wines and pairing. I will come back! They have 2 other spots in the Pijp, and now I want to try those too."
5,De Gouden Reael, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Food is amazing, but service is impressivly slow.
It took us almost 3 hours to have dinner. And we were starving. From dish to dish it takes ages. …"

11,De Gouden Reael, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Out of the centre, off the beaten place, it's a shame that this place is under most people's radar. Especially in terms of their brunch. Brunch is finally starting to take off around Amsterdam, but this place is already a star with their …"
12,De Gouden Reael, 1 star ,4 years ago,"By far the worst dining experience I've had abroad. The service was subpar, with the waiter seemingly upset that we sat in a ""four"" person table instead of two, so we moved. However, he was perfectly fine with another couple sitting down in …"
13,De Gouden Reael, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We popped in for a quick breakfast since there were limited options in the area. Not many breakfast items on the menu here but the owner was quite accommdating. He whipped up a delicious ham and cheese pannini and hot coffee for us. A lovely little spot with a view of the river and harbor.
14,De Gouden Reael, 1 star ,a year ago,"The most horrible dark haired-host ever. Coming from a boat my friend had to pee really badly. Ready to order drinks or whatever else was necessary to allow her to use the bathroom, the host was not understandable at all to the situation …"

18,De Gouden Reael, 4 stars ,10 years ago,"Classic French cuisine with no frills and copious portions. Not very creative or original, but certainly tasty.

19,De Gouden Reael, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Beautiful food…
20,De Gouden Reael, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"This place offers 'perspective' to many typical dutch ingredients, the staff is friendly, their kitchen is open and it has an awesome location. Makes me want to come back whenever I can afford it."

27,De Gouden Reael, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"It is a nice place but they should update google search for opening hours, twice went for their famous brunch and we got closed doors, while in the site it says ""Open""."
28,De Gouden Reael, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is exceptionally charming, only sat here for a coffee, but I will definitely try some of their meals next time."
