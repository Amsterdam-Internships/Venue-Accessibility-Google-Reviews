0,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Very chilled and relaxed place, my favourite spot to go enjoy a nice joint in their awesome couch. The day barman is so nice and friendly you'll feel at home right away! They also ocasionnally have DJs playing music at night"
1,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Nice atmosphere, people and prices. Live DJ almost every night!"
2,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Super cafe and coffeeshop to chill out. Located 5 min from the Leidseplein around the corner of 1 of the best shopping streets of Amsterdam (kinkerstraat). Snacks, drinks LIVE DJ and a lovely staff. Also since it is 5 min away from the centre the prices are a lot better :)"
3,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really cool decor, comfortable lounge areas and chilled atmosphere.
Reasonable prices. Good range of drinks."
4,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,4 months ago,What can I say except excellent coffeeshop go here every time we are in Amsterdam my wife‚Äôs favourite coffeeshop
5,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, delicious food and drinks and comfy couches. What else do you need to get high? Would recommend to everybody who just wants to chill and enjoy getting high in a warm place in Amsterdam."
6,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautifully bonkers place, serving the BEST mojitos! Little gem off the main street. Must see by all! Staff amazingly friendly."
7,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this cafe, it has a crazy owner who is the nicest guy ever! Very friendly such a nice jamming place to kick back and relax. I have played here PM the decks twice now and had a belter of a time and will be returning again next March, ‚Ä¶"
8,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"This place is outside of the tourist area and more of a local thing. However its an amazing and sort of undiscovered gem. Great music, the staff is really friendly and in the back you can just lay on top of a lot of pillows and have a smoke. Prices are good too. A must go to if you're looking for a place to chill."
9,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome place for Manali cream!! Vibe is gold.
10,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My absolutely favourite coffeeshop in Amsterdam. Very cozy place to smoke, especially the room with huge pillows to sit (or lie) on. Doesn‚Äôt get too crowded since it‚Äôs not in the center, but localization is still very good. Would recommend to everyone wanting to explore some nice coffeeshops."
11,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good music, a great mix of locals and tourists make it a comfortable, diverse blend. Great to relax and have a drink or a smoke. They also have a handy coffee shop directly across the road."
12,Kashmir Lounge, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice place. One of my favorites smoking bars in Amsterdam. The only thing I dont like is the fact that they only accept money as a form of payment.  We are in the 21st century, you have to make it better guys."
13,Kashmir Lounge, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great coffeeshop and bar. Due to having a joined address they can serve both counters together. Cozy and comfy if you get a good seat. Live DJ most of the time. Chilled atmosphere with a separate smoking area for cigarettes. 9/10 Must see for smokers.
14,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A cannabis-friendly bar where you can order drinks from the bar and smoke cannabis - if you don't have your own, you can conveniently  order from the sister coffeeshop across the street. ‚Ä¶"
15,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"They allow you to smoke weed or hash in there, but they don't sell it's technically a bar. You can however walk across the road to their coffee shop and buy it there. The coffee shop sells nice hash (and probably weed by the amount of people going in and out) and the bloke selling it is cool. Recommended."
16,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome atmosphere in the lounge, comfy chairs to unwind in. Good price on weed/edibles, what more can you ask for? Came here as we got a cold attitude from Boerjongens and were put off by the whole thing, but the staff here were wonderful ‚Ä¶"
17,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good vibes all the way. Music is always right, not loud not too low, just perfect. Coffee is great and the furniture is very comfortable and laidback."
18,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favourite places when I want to chill for a while, everytime I'm 8n Amsterdam i come here at least once. Weed is good, decent prices but most of all the atmosphere and comfy smoke room are great  while getting high."
19,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best coffeshop/lounge. On one side of the street there is coffeshop, on the other coffeshop.
They also provide some food and snacks. ‚Ä¶"
20,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, great local DJ Daddy Mystic. Bartenders were accommodating to not knowing Dutch. Would recommend you grab a beer and a smoke."
21,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great chilled out atmosphere and amazing chocolate milk
22,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Been many times. Always good vibes & never the same DJ twice in a row. Music & venue work together in perfect harmony. Drinks & food also pretty inexpensive
23,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Favourite coffeeshop in Amsterdam! Chill vibe, feels a bit more of a bar than a coffeeshop but still very laid back. Dope decor, friendly staff, and well priced good green; would definitely recommend to anybody visiting amsterdam, heaps close to a tram stop üëç"
24,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,cozy relaxed bar with cannabis taste. their coffeeshop dispensary is across the street so they are allowed to serve alcohol. place has usually a  live dj and the most friendliest staff
25,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I really like the atmosphere. The only problem that I had is they don't accept payments by card, that it's perfectly legit for me, but i'm not used to carry cash anymore since I'm in the Netherlands üòÖ"
26,Kashmir Lounge, 2 stars ,3 years ago,It used to be one of the few coffeeshops (as in places to smoke marijuana) where you could also drink. When the law changed they kept the bar & the smoking & moved the maryjane across the road. ‚Ä¶

31,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"good place, amazing people !! they helped me with a stealedwallet and thanks them how fast they checked the cameras to help the costumer!! before that they were nice and humble!! will be there next time I take amsterdam"
32,Kashmir Lounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best best best coffeshop in amsterdam, cushion floor seating, food and great staff. i think the best hash is there. they also dont treat you like an animal like in Baba or other famous coffeeshops."

58,Kashmir Lounge, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Not my favorite place: music is dreadful, public is even worse: full of guys that think girls are there in need of them, as opposed to being there for a chat, a drink and a hassle free smoke.
