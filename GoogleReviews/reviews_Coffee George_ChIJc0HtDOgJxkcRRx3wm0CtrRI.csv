0,Coffee George, 5 stars ,7 months ago,I had a delicious vegetarian burger with sweet potato fries. The lemonade mocktail was tasty and fresh. Service very good and friendly
1,Coffee George, 1 star ,4 months ago,We were kindly received by the waitress and immediately ordered some food and drinks. We were surprised that our food arrived after an hour and a half. The oysters were given away to another table and without apologies we had to wait an ‚Ä¶
2,Coffee George, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Almost a five star review for this trendy and busy restaurant, if not the steak had been too cold and the dessert took too long to come. Otherwise the cooking certainly above average and the service very pleasant ... even though my ‚Ä¶"
3,Coffee George, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Despite waiting 20 minutes to be seated past our scheduled reservation time, the food was delish and the atmosphere of the terrace dining along the canal was very pleasant."
4,Coffee George, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"I loveeee oysters and have tried many places but these are my favorite in town! Other dishes are so so, good Chablis."
5,Coffee George, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great caf√©. Great coffee and food. Went there with my dog GEORGE! üê∂‚òï‚ù§Ô∏è
6,Coffee George, 5 stars ,5 months ago,From service to food everything has a high class. Rissotta with beetroots is worth trying!
7,Coffee George, 2 stars ,3 months ago,Nice atmosphere and decor but service and food could be better.  Price high for what you get.  Wouldn't rush back anytime soon üòï
8,Coffee George, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing experience.
Good french food .
Very friendly staff and atmosphere. ‚Ä¶"
9,Coffee George, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Don be fooled by the nicely decorated interior- the service and food don‚Äôt match.If only they spent more time and money on training the staff. Extremely poor service. Took 25 mins to get someone to take our order. Restaurant wasn‚Äôt even full. Food was okay. If you like Dunkin Donuts coffee you‚Äôll love it here.
10,Coffee George, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Best pasta with vongole ever. Meet the chef for more surprises
11,Coffee George, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Very slow service and payment. The simple breakfast will take forever. Very average breakfast. Steak sandwich is great. Hence the 3 star for that. Otherwise, 2 stars would be more than enough"
12,Coffee George, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"It was busy with a love DJ. If you're looking for a quiet dinner I wouldn't recommend.
Food was good and nice options, service could be show at times, but understandbly s√≥ due to the place being full."
13,Coffee George, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food was unbelievably good! The service was well to do and spoke English. I'd recommend eating one of the specials. Enjoy I'll be back for more!
14,Coffee George, 2 stars ,3 months ago,Below my expected food and service for the price.
15,Coffee George, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Central location by the canal, food is fine but not spectacular for the price. The waitors are friendly but not always remember your order. Recommend the tuna avocado starter! Lamb is slightly hard to cut and chew but the sauce is yummy!"
16,Coffee George, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We were a party of 16 so had the set menu which was great. All food came out in a timely fashion and was all delicious. Very generous portions too. Also the Heineken was suitably cold and the staff ensured we were well looked after.
17,Coffee George, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice food, service was a little too slow, very aware the service in the Netherlands is slightly different, but this may have been a bit too much!"
18,Coffee George, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Not a good experience!! The food was ok but the service was dissapointing, very inpolite and really slowüëéüëéüëé. I will not visit it again for sure!!"
19,Coffee George, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Constantly delicious,  we love the George! All locations got it together and Everything on the menu is great!"
20,Coffee George, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Good food, but the service was slow and our order was mixed up, during lunch when we did not have a ton of time."
21,Coffee George, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"This is my favorite place in Amsterdam!! Great food, service, location, and atmosphere. ‚Ä¶"
22,Coffee George, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Good view over the canal. Food was decent. Service was quite modest. What worsened the experience was the three bread slices for 5‚Ç¨ that we were offered while waiting for appetizers, with the insinuation it was complementary..."
23,Coffee George, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The place has a cool vibe and a nice staff, the dishes we ordered came out relatively quickly even though there were a lot of people in the restaurant. I ate the George house steak (medium) , the steak was in the right cooking level but a ‚Ä¶"
24,Coffee George, 3 stars ,8 months ago,The food was good and would recommend the espresso martinis!  The view over the canal is beautiful but the service is so slow! Took around 30 minutes to receive the menus and another 15 minutes to order.
25,Coffee George, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice and quiet place next to the canals. You‚Äòre not next to a busy street with constant traffic next to you. On the pricy side and the wait for the food is considerable, but the location and food make up for it. Staff very friendly and the Terrasse is inviting."
26,Coffee George, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Fish and chips and a burger and 2 orange juice 58‚Ç¨‚Ä¶ A bit pricey but what can I say, it looks like more a wannaBe place with good food but expensive. Which is what people want today, thinking of paying a lot to feel good? Fish and Chips? ‚Ä¶"
27,Coffee George, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You know the feeling when you start eating and it is so good that you're afraid you won't get enough of it, well that is what the simple & pure steak tartare initiated with me. Pure, simple, good value for money. Very strongly recommend"
28,Coffee George, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Over priced. Do not get the ni√ßoise salad (22 euros): 4 slices of tuna, 1/2 an egg, 2 greenbeans.....drowned in bad lettuce and a bad slice of tomato"
29,Coffee George, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great atmosphere and drinks, but average food quality."
30,Coffee George, 1 star ,8 months ago,"The restaurant is beautiful and the people and vibe are great, our waitress was very nice and helpful, the food is terrible and badly made!! They even forgot our desert! Left hungry and badly serve !"
31,Coffee George, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The location is really nice, it is central yet quiet. Sitting next to the canal is also a great opportunity but it is a bit cramped if you want to sit next to the canal. The food was ok, bitterballen was nice. The steak sandwich is not ‚Ä¶"
32,Coffee George, 1 star ,4 years ago,"It was below average, poor service and the waiter got confused and changed our order. The food itself was simply poor, you can find much better hollandaise in Amsterdam. Also it took super too long to bring the bill."
33,Coffee George, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Really good food, good vibes, and good decor. Can‚Äôt really ask for more"
34,Coffee George, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,Very but very disrespectful staff members! Don‚Äôt recommend it
35,Coffee George, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"As a tourist we found the food 6/10, the service was shocking along with some of the worst coffee I had in Amsterdam."
36,Coffee George, 3 stars ,7 months ago,The place has a nice location and interior. But had to wait for club sandwich for one hour and seven minutes. Usually it is something that is served in 10-15 mins.
37,Coffee George, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very delicious meal. We had the vegetarian options which there were only a few. However they were both delicious. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and the service was brilliant.
38,Coffee George, 1 star ,5 months ago,This is a Dump of a place to spend your hard earned money . The food should be used to feed the homeless on the streets .These people dont know the difference .
39,Coffee George, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Very nice food and waiters but the order delay is a bit long.
40,Coffee George, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place and good food and drinks.  No complaints really.  Based on the other reviews, I was a bit skeptical.  However, the worries were not founded.   Service is slower than most Americans may want but this is not the US.  Be aware of ‚Ä¶"
41,Coffee George, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very nice place and friendly service
Stopped here for breakfast. Fruit and croissant were good and fresh. All delivered with a smile. ‚Ä¶"
42,Coffee George, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Terrible service led us to leave. I am sure the Kirchen is great but, when we entered the (completely) empty restaurant at 11.01h on a Monday for lunch, we were only offered the bar tables up front. When I asked for a nice table in the ‚Ä¶"
43,Coffee George, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, nice food. Usually packed and fully booked, so better make reservations in advance. Draw back is bad acoustics which makes it loud and more difficult to understand each other. Vegetarian options are very limited unfortunately, but will definitely come back here."
44,Coffee George, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, very nice atmosphere. Service great."
45,Coffee George, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I give a three stars as I think the food/ambience was good, but not good enough to justify the price. Some details need to be refined. The salt came in the supermarket packaging (not very charming), and we found warm cans of anchovies+olives on the table (not free)."
46,Coffee George, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Love this place. Visit it often. Risotto and steak are both üëåüëåüëå
47,Coffee George, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great location & vibe at Cafe George at all times. Ideal for a drink or meetings. The food is not memorable here and it's not what always brings me back. The food is just okay. As for the service it's decent & fast.
48,Coffee George, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The food was fantastic!  They would have gotten 5 stars had the service been a bit better.  It wasn't off putting it was just slow and I had to inspire the menus and service initially (meaning once we took our seats it took a while so I ‚Ä¶
49,Coffee George, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Crowded on a Friday evening so service was slow.  Food was very good, and they accommodated a change in the fish entre. The best list of appetizers and entrees that I had seen in this small a neighborhood restaurant in Amsterdam.   0verall an A+ for this eatery near the museum quarter."
50,Coffee George, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Slow service. Amazing looking place on a quiet street. Food looked great it's just a shame that when we sat down and ordered, 15 minutes passed and we didn't even get our black coffee and OJ. Wasn't busy at all either. Cancelled our order unfortunately as had to run to another reservation."
51,Coffee George, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great brunch and we were seated quickly despite the rush. Service was not bad although they forgot a couple of our drinks. Not a big issue. A good brunch spot overall.
52,Coffee George, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Great food but worst service I've had in living memory.
We arrived around 10pm and the restaurant was half full. We were prompty offered a table but the service stopped there. It took over 15 minutes to receive a ‚Ä¶"

55,Coffee George, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful, quiet, good food. Get a table outside."
56,Coffee George, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good restaurant with classic food. They have local beers as well and a good choice of wines.
The bad thing is that the service is quite low and we stayed about three hours ‚Ä¶"
57,Coffee George, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This is a cool little hangout. We were staying nearby and didn't want to hang out on the Leidseplein because it's so touristy and chaotic. We went to Cafe George and were treated very well. It  has enough energy but not so much you feel ‚Ä¶
58,Coffee George, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best restaurants of Amsterdam. The quality of the food is excellent - must try the burger, steak tartare, tuna - and the bloody mary incredible. Really good place to go for lunch. Beautiful terrace next to the canal."
59,Coffee George, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food, nice ambiance."
60,Coffee George, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice caf√©, very friendly staff, but the food was just bland and uninspired. There aren't many vegetarian or vegan options on their regular menu. Luckily their day specials had some... but even so... just okay."
61,Coffee George, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Very friendly staff, beautiful space. Food was okay. We ordered a burger and a steak rare, both were good but closer to medium rare. Salad was bland."
62,Coffee George, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Lound, too much pepper and 4 asperagus for 17 euro..."
63,Coffee George, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Really slow service. Took an hour to get our starter. At the hour we got the wrong starter, which led the staff to be very confused, and only made us more anxious as we were worried they had forgotten us entirely! We then said we would ‚Ä¶"
64,Coffee George, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Excellent food, great service and beautiful location and weather."
65,Coffee George, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Not good for veggies & vegans. They serve olives, sold as 'olives' stuffed with anchovies. When we complained, they didn't even apologise. Not impressed & I would not recommend. Expensive drinks as well."
66,Coffee George, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Food is awful and the prices are outrageous. 4,50‚Ç¨ for a tiny glass of OJ. Cold toast with plain eggs for 8‚Ç¨. There is nothing New York about this place. It is just another cafe and there are far superior options for better price range ‚Ä¶"
67,Coffee George, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Had I been asked to write a review for last year, I would have given it at least a 4 star. Unfortunately, this place sucks now. The staff are extremely rude and unprofessional. They ignore you when you first walk in and you have to really ‚Ä¶"
68,Coffee George, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty cafe/bar, very elegant, not extremely noisy yet very lively, great crowd. Great for a drink, terrible food though. Mediocre presentation, less than mediocre in taste. Excellent staff, very friendly, very hospitable."
69,Coffee George, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice atmosphere at lunch.
In general a little bit pricy but we are in the centrr of Amsterdam so is understandable. ‚Ä¶"
70,Coffee George, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing Gin Tonics. Delicious artichoke and Croque Madame. The breakfast Benedict‚Äôs are also very good. Nice atmosphere and location.
71,Coffee George, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"3 stars for the food and decoration, 2 stars less  for the arrogant waiters. One lit the table candle and slide threw on my lap almost and was annoyed we wanted to pay separate, also the girl at the paypoint told me‚Äùtell me the sum i cant go through one by one‚Äù."

73,Coffee George, 4 stars ,3 months ago,All ok but not memorable
74,Coffee George, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The steak frites is very good with the beurre d‚Äôescargot la miam
75,Coffee George, 1 star ,5 years ago,Food was nice but for some eggs and french toast we waited an hour. The service was the most passive aggressive service experience we have had. Would not recommend.
76,Coffee George, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"george it's a nice place in terms of vibe, food and sometimes crowd. but the service is definitely one of the worst you can encounter - from calling to make reservations, to waiting time, rudeness and impoliteness. if they were to make an ‚Ä¶"
77,Coffee George, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"George's is the best. I love their entire franchise. The chefs they hire, especially Marco at this particular venue is a master in his art. the staff is young and hip and super friendly. I love George's."
78,Coffee George, 1 star ,3 years ago,The restaurant looks nice. But the service is very bad. It took them more than 40 min to bring me my damn burger. There was a drugged person inside harassing everyone. Stay away
79,Coffee George, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We had breakfast at George.The service is really bad, the staff was uninterested, the food was average in comparison with the price. My tea cup was chipped and the other glasses were dirty. ‚Ä¶"
80,Coffee George, 1 star ,a year ago,"I have loved the food from Cafe George but what I received for a ‚Ç¨24 chicken was ridiculously small!  This is pathetic. This is a pigeon, not a chicken."
81,Coffee George, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious food,  and wine! Great for lunch, dinner, or even just a place to relax with a glass of wine. In summer, it gets packed full, for good reason."
82,Coffee George, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Cafe George has a very cosy atmosphere. Light background music and on a canal side. Prices are not expensive and the stuff is friendly. Going there again for sure :)
83,Coffee George, 5 stars ,6 months ago,A cosy small waterfront caf√© in the center away from the crowds
