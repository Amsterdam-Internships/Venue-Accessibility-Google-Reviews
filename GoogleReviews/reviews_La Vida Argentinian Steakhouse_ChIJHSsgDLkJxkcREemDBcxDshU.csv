2,La Vida Argentinian Steakhouse, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, reasonable prices, great food (restaurant is a little bit small and crowdly, but for sure worth to be visited)."
3,La Vida Argentinian Steakhouse, 1 star ,8 months ago,"I think we got a pork. The flavour is pork, we order sirloin steak but we got a white meat. I never see in my life a white sirloin steak."
4,La Vida Argentinian Steakhouse, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Meat is good, but one has to keep in mind that no sides/sauces are included with your steak."
5,La Vida Argentinian Steakhouse, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's a small argentinian restaurant,but good food, friendly staff and a good atmosphere. I ate a steak and pommes, recommand.When I come to Amsterdam again,I'll eat there ;) E la senora fue muy amable,muchas gracias por todo."
6,La Vida Argentinian Steakhouse, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Meat is ok. The rest is average. Service is average. Side, sauce and bread are all extras. I had the sensation to be ordering car options. Ice cream has both cherries and cookie on the menu picture, which are missing on the dish."
7,La Vida Argentinian Steakhouse, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very poor service. Appetisers arrived after main course. Sauces arrived after we had eaten. The mixed grill was very small with the lamb cutlet barely constructing a mouthful. ‚òπÔ∏è

10,La Vida Argentinian Steakhouse, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great Steak, however my friend found a long hair in his. Drinks wise, asking for tap water is a challenge, and after requesting to change the Coca Cola due to it being flat, the manager refused as it was a ‚Äúfresh bottle‚Äù. All potato descriptions are Jacket Potatoes - don‚Äôt be fooled!"
11,La Vida Argentinian Steakhouse, 1 star ,2 years ago,Misleading name . You won‚Äôt get any Argentina food or experience. They should call it Egyptian restaurant .. the cook and servers are Egyptians who pretend they are from Argentina . One star because for the waiter who start his shift and start serving customers without washing his hands first
