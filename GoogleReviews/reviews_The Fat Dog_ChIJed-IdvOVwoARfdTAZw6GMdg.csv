1,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,a month ago,"We ordered  a walk in the park, a cocktail with ford's gin, lime, agave and aragula. It's very good but the glass is a little small. Also, we ordered the burguer with ground sirloin, caramelized onions, manchego, baby aragula and brioche ‚Ä¶"

9,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My kids and I loved the fried chicken, burger, nutella mousse, and fried oreo sundae ‚ù§ the presentation was perfect - not pretentious or self indulgent, rather comfortable and inviting. Pub grub at its best. Can't wait to try more from the menu üòä"

25,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Upon entering the location it was a little gloomy with candles on the tables to set the mood. This is a very upscale bar.

26,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Came here for brunch and had a great time. They have a good selection of drinks and beers on tap. The food was delicious, I had the chicken fried chicken. The service was on point as well. The only downside is parking can be a bit of a pain."

34,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Very good service, decent food. The prices are average LA (so fairly expensive), and it's all your average fatty, salty, and yummy stuff. Drinks were good too. Overall, would recommend."

36,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good drinks, the service is spotty and the menu changes every time I'm there. Dog friendly, so lots of doggos. Not a bad place for a drink and a snack."

Can't wait to return. And the atmosphere is so relaxed. There service was also incredible everyone was attentive!!!

39,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,a month ago,My wife and I love Fat Dog! Work the whole menu!
40,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,a year ago,We stopped here after a long day of driving back and forth to Santa Barbara. My son recommended the place. He said we'd love it. We did. I had the Fat Dog of course. I needed to experience one and I knew I could pick off the plates of my son and my wife. Great place. Find your way there when you can.
41,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Absolutely love this place. Came for the fish and chips but they ran out(which should tell you that they keep it fresh!), so I ordered the mussels instead. Couldn't have been happier ‚ò∫"

47,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Since I moved to NoHo, this has become one of my most beloved places. Most of their menu is delicious, but I always get the Hot Wings and Rainbow Fries. A bit messy since they serve whole wings, but always delicious. Their beer list is ‚Ä¶"

49,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great wine and beer flights plus great service. Daily pasta always a good choice
50,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great beer selection! Whiskey Wednesdays and Wino Tuesdays are the best. To eat, I usually get the alternative burger made vegan and it's delicious. The fries are amazing too and even come with a tasty vegan dip! I wish the burger buns were vegan too, but the lettuce replacement is still tasty."
51,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely amazing. Stuff was great food amazing and well priced.
52,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food was great and the vibe of the place was cool. You can bring your furry friends as well.
53,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The parking is pretty horrendous but I guess that's what you'd expect in any Los Angeles hipster neighborhood! Once you find a place to park, however the drinks and food are definitely worth it. I recommend staying away from the fish and ‚Ä¶"
54,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Their brunch menu is great. Their version of a Bloody Mary was spot on. Too many good things to pick from their drink menu. The place is also dog friendly as if that‚Äôs a surprise with a name like The Fat Dog
55,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is pretty awesome, especially if you like dogs. People bring their dogs here and the animals, when I went, were well behaved. Avoid if you have dog allergies.  The food is good and they serve alcohol during brunch. I am not sure ‚Ä¶"
56,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food is delicious! Ample space for a fun dinner party or to spend quiet time at the bar. The food is reasonably priced and they have a variety of drinks so you can't go wrong.
57,The Fat Dog, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Would happily revise two more stars if they can fix their staffing issues. Otherwise, I don't want to recommend people go there on a weekday for lunch. Delicious food, but not prepared for the lunch rush. I really don't understand this ‚Ä¶"
58,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great outdoor seating. Great service. Took time to find parking but so worth it. Cannot wait to go back. The salad is addicting!
59,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place has the food, prices, drinks, crowd and decor that people just love. They got everything right here. I love their small plates. I love that they have a few communal tables. That is such a good idea in a bar environment. The ‚Ä¶"

61,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Been meaning to make it to the noho location since one of our favorites, the West Hollywood location, closed. Great as ever (best burger)! Love the outdoor space. Had to park a bit away, totally worth the walk."
62,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great place for groups ants outdoor drinks!
63,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went here for my friend's birthday. Beers are around $7, cocktails $9+, unlimited soda refills even if you're just drinking. ‚Ä¶"
64,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Good food and great selection of beers. I certainly hope they keep the outdoor space around as long as possible!
65,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Food was delicious, service was GREAT. Especially compared to Kahuna Tiki next door, they were behind the 8 ball. I'd go to Fat Dog a million times over, loved it"
66,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"You can taste the grill on these hamburgers.

Fine selection of beers on tap and excellent liquor on the shelves. Service ‚Ä¶"
67,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is pretty good, but service is very casual. It's really more a bar that serves food than a restaurant. And if you happen to go during brunch, they only serve from the brunch menu, which is a little annoying. But they do have a large patio where you can hang out with your doggo, and that makes it worth it"
68,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Used their dog friendly patio for brunch. Got a creme brulee granola cup that was great. It looked like they mixed their own granola and typed it with fresh yogurt preserves and honey. Had a good beer and cocktail selection to choose from while you much on your food. Got a seasonal pumpkin beer that was. The staff was attentive.
69,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious! Dog friendly patio with a good vibe
70,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An incredible gastropub that has a dog friendly patio, incredible drinks, and delicious food for both humans and pups alike!

71,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The Nice people, good service, the pictures do not do justice to this place. It is bigger on the the inside than the photos suggest.
I ordered what the the bartender called the lager, very tasty. ‚Ä¶"
72,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Everyone should try this restaurant. They are the best across the state! Great food, cozy ambiance, the staff and crew were lively and polite. Everything was perfect. You can enjoy a sumptuous meal together with your family. This place is highly recommended."
73,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,3 years ago,My favorite Bloody Mary in LA. Just the right amount of heavy on the horseradish. The food is hard to beat. Consistently great. It‚Äôs pricier than its neighbors but you‚Äôll notice when you taste the food. Great place for football if you‚Äôre trying to avoid a loud sports bar.
74,The Fat Dog, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was mediocre at best. Burger was basically raw and had no seasoning. Beet salad was tasty, as was the bread pudding. Atmosphere is so snobbish. And parking is non existent. Won't be back."
75,The Fat Dog, 3 stars ,5 years ago,The Fat Dog is a nice trendy place with a youthful vibe. It has indoor and outdoor seating with two bars. There is a mister to keep the outside cool in the hot weatherboard The food is good. I found the service attentive when I didn't need ‚Ä¶
76,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This has become my favorite Noho spot for dinner and drinks in an area dense with gastropubs and bars. The food is so good. This is actually my mom's favorite burger, and I don't blame her; its juicy and filling and rewards you with each ‚Ä¶"
77,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place when you can get service. My friend has waited 45 minutes to get her order taken when sitting at the tables. I always sit at the bar and service is fine. On Valentine's day we did have to flag down our server, but I do enjoy ‚Ä¶"
78,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,a year ago,Cozy outdoor patio to enjoy a late bite and talk without to much noise. Short rib sandwich is scrumptious beyond my wildest imagination. Also loved the presentation of the tomato soup with sandwich.
79,The Fat Dog, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was pricey. They will not make substitutions, or remove an item even if your allergic. I asked about removing something I was allergic to, the waitress gave me a dirty look and reminded me that they make no substitutions. ‚Ä¶"
80,The Fat Dog, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Cream of tomato soup was very good. It came with a small toasted cheese sandwich made with artisan bread.
The pasta daily special was disappointing. ‚Ä¶"
81,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic cocktails, and I usually enjoy the dog drink of the day, which is a nice deal. The food is actually really good too, but I tend to go for the drinks. They have a ""no substitutions"" thing on their menu."
82,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We live across the street from this place, and while there are tons of restaurants in the NoHo arts district, this is always the place we go.  The food is excellent, the portions are not small or huge, they're right at that spot that allows ‚Ä¶"
83,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely LOVED this place. My only complaint is that I wish I lived closer üòÄ The food and drinks were amazing, service and staff were excellent. And the place is filled with portraits and paintings of mainly English bulldogs, some ‚Ä¶"
84,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place, beer selection and gastro pub!"
85,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had the veggie burger! Omg!!! So so good. I wasn‚Äôt even that hungry when I went. Absolutely delicious. Ordered sweet potato fries. They are very generous with the fries! U can actually share them with 4 people. The dips are amazing!!! Aoili, lemon aioli Wow!!!"
86,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Love their cocktails here and their comfort food. I'm a big fan of their Mac and cheese... I usually get it with crab! There is some great outdoor seating, but sitting inside at the bar is always fun too!"
87,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"On the verge of pricier than I'd like but overall I really like the place. Good food, drinks, beer selection, and service. Good TV's for an interesting fusion that can't be fully called a sports bar. Convenient for when there's a game I'd like to watch and hang out with friends who are not sports fans."
88,The Fat Dog, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Slow service.  Food ok. The idea is to keep your party ordering drinks.  If the food was great 2 more stars but the combo brought the best score to a 2.75.  In addition mgmt confrontational so best to say nothing or better yet look ‚Ä¶
89,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fun and casual gastropub in NoHo. Good mix of indoor and outdoor seating, good cocktail and beer selection and reasonable prices. ‚Ä¶"
90,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Here on a Friday at 6:30 no reservation. Was seated immediately and food was quick and fresh! Drink ""Well Groomed"" was delicious. Chicken Sandwich was tasty. Service was awesome. Clean and fun decor. Will return for sure. üòä"
91,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great bar in NoHo. Good craft beer selection, and the food is top notch. Not wide ranging, but tasty. Same with the drink selection. A great jump off, or mid night choice. If you are a pet owner, daily options to bring your love ones in ‚Ä¶"
92,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"excellent drinks and well placed for both inside and outdoors dining. it is a ""gastropub"" in that their dining selections and preparations are exceptional. biggest problem is parking in this area. good luck with that!"
93,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,All of the staff are great!!!!!!!!!!! Awesome food and they love dogs!!!!!!! Especially when your new little guy(4 month old dachshund) named Gaston gets all the attention!!!!! I flew in from Denver just for the day to get my pup and looked ‚Ä¶
94,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Doggo Friendly!. Tasty food, friendly staff, indoor and outdoor seating. Serves beer, wine and cocktails. Vegetarian friendly!. Prices are fair. Parking can be difficult- meter parking available."
95,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for dogs, and food.... This dog friendly establishment has a great menu for bar food. Also some great special's for whiskey, & full bar. The atmosphere of the day or night patio is an enjoyable experience."
96,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Though our server seemed to have a chip on his shoulder about something, the food was stellar. The Fat Dog is a must try for everybody... It's a hot dog masterpiece. The veggie burger seemed to hate structural integrity; despite it's aversion to staying in one piece, it was super!"
97,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Standard anyplace USA gastropub. Good service, good food.  Good for groups. It‚Äôs on the positive side of meh."

101,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I've been here three times and the experience has been very good each time. The food is generally pretty tasty, but nothing that I'd rave about to friends or family. It's a very comfortable place to hang out and have a drink with friends."
102,The Fat Dog, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Cool bar with indoor and outdoor bars. Great for getting together with friends over beers and pub style food. Another great thing about this restaurant is its location, perfectly located a few doors down from Republic of Pie, which is a must at the end of the evening!"
103,The Fat Dog, 1 star ,3 years ago,So I ate the hot wings and fries at 4:30PM. I‚Äôve been throwing up and using the bathroom since 10:45PM last night. ‚Ä¶
104,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, good prices on brunch drinks and attentive service. The patio is great and comfy for weekend brunch with an outdoor bar for service. Patio is also dog-friendly. Major downfall is horrible parking, but that doesn't deter from good food and service."

110,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So I was at the Tam O'Shanter thoroughly meh'd by the Mac and cheese which got us talking about Mac and cheese and all the places that make great Mac and also just great food. The Fat Dog is at the top of the list for food, great cocktails, great atmosphere, and great service üëç"
111,The Fat Dog, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food for a good price, their pasta of the day is always a hit. I have yet to try their drinks, but I am sure they are equally delicious. Great, quick, and friendly service as well."
112,The Fat Dog, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Came here for a party. Had the Burger, it was the most tasteless nightmare of a ""Burger"" I have ever had. I found out I was not alone in the burger being horrible... When I brought this to the servers attention he took it back and said he ‚Ä¶"
