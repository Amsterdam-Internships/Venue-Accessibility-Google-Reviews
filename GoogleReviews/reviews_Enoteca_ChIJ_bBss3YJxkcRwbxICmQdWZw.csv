1,Enoteca, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there, because we were staying at the “The Manor” Hotel in the same building and did not feel like you going outside again after a busy day.

2,Enoteca, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Was here for their special wine tasting and chefs menu. Great service, good stories and good food (awesome risotto). Had some allergie wishes and it went smooth, only had to let them know once. Great :)"
3,Enoteca, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Good high-class Italian restaurant in an up and coming neighborhood called Oost. Is part of the Eden Hotel which is located adjacent to it. Food was good, but not that good that it justifies the hefty price tag. Very extensive wine list.  All if them can be ordered by glass. Nice!"
4,Enoteca, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing ! Just the best ""tartufo pasta"" of my life. Truffle was very taste and the sauce so creamy.
Also, the staff was very smiling and congenial"
5,Enoteca, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy restaurant with delicious food and great service! Try the tiramisu, you will not be disappointed.
I can really recommend the place for couples that are celebrating 5 years together."
6,Enoteca, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Everything you would expect from a neighborhood hotel bar: Some lonely guests, bright lights, decoration that could be Ikea, an absent minded bartender - yet pretty good wines by the generous glass and snacks-."
7,Enoteca, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice food for reasonable price. We could not find a place to eat since everywhere was full, this came very handy andb it was almost empty. I think because it is in the hotel and not very visible from outside."
8,Enoteca, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Extremely poor service. Took 20 minutes to be acknowledged and a further 20 to be told they had no Coca cola or Peroni. Forgot our bread and mains arrived before the bread did. Overall very disappointing, especially as the prices are so expensuve"
9,Enoteca, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Slow service. Food is ok at best. The beer came in a dirty glass and finally the waitress forgot us when we wanted to order dessert.
