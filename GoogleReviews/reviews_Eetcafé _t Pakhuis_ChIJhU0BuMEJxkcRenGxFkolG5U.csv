29,Eetcaf√© 't Pakhuis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"This traditional Dutch Eet-caf√© is a local favourite for Amsterdamers (like me). What I like most about it, is that it is still one of the very few Eet-caf√©s in Amsterdam that are not losing their identity to please the over present tourist scene. The quality price factor is fair which will appeal to tourists and locals alike."
