1,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Love the location. The skewers are extremely delicious, especially the Unagi, YOU MUST ORDER. The service is also top notch.
However, the Udon and Ramen we ordered is just average but pricy, not that …"
2,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I love a good izakaya. Amsterdam has surprised me with this little gem. Been here twice and everything’s fantastic. Really love the wasabi yam as a drinking dish. Not cheap, but worth the price!"
3,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great cozy Japanese restaurant that actually brings out that authentic Japanese izakaya feeling. Pretty sure this is one of the best restaurants to experience real Japanese flavours and a Japanese atmosphere. Do not hesitate to try ""odd"" dishes like chicken skin or chicken heart as they are absolutely delicious! ごちそうさまでした！"
4,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Best grill kipmaggen I had in Netherlands. Just order all the grill skewers on the menu, none would disappoint you.
Kombucha and Yuzu beer must try!"

I love all their dishes! Especially the chicken nanban was amazing. Very tender, …"
7,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Yakitori place but tonkotsu ramen was so good! I felt like back in japan :) staff was nice, good atmosphere. Yakitori is very good, but felt like little bit over price"
8,Hakata Senpachi, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Fine dine prices without the experience. For 25 euro I got some overpriced fatty tuna samples, my girlfriend got 3 thin beef slices for 18 euro. If you charge these prices (by the side of the road, so not great location) then at least have …"
9,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Had a delicious dinner here. The ambience and staff were very nice. It can be quite expensive, but there are also a lot of cheaper dishes that looked amazing and seem to be quite filling, like a ramen dish. …"
10,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,a year ago,"It is an authentic Japanese restaurant with even the Menu written in Japanese with an English translation. The location is beautiful, with seating inside and outside. We took quite some time to order but the food came in quickly. The …"
11,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Amazing authentic Japanese izakaya! Loved every bite of it! But a bit over priced for not being a fine dinning and if you compare it to silimar izakayas in Japan.
12,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The best Izakaya style Japanese place in Amsterdam. Service can be a bit clunky, but the food is great and very tasty. The Ramen was ok, but then again you do not go to an Izakaya for the Ramen. All washed down with a good Asahi dry."
13,Hakata Senpachi, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Love the location and restaurant, food was excellent, my dish was beef wagyu curry and my wife bowl wagyu beef"
14,Hakata Senpachi, 2 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Been here many times. Loved the grilled foods. Unfortunately the grilled dishes are far less tasty than before. I ordered 8 different dishes today only the Teba remained same old quality. Shiitake is okay. Teriyaki Irish beef, Negima, …"
15,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Blink twice and wonder yourself in Tokyo. Honestly, so far, this is the most authentic Japanese restaurant I have been outside of Japan. Taste is genuinely original and very flavourful—the perfect place for a casual dinner with friends. …"
16,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Absolutely authentic japanese taste and atmosphere, would highly recommend going here!"
17,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Tried different dishes like ramen, rice, karage. The soup was separated from the ramen so if this is needed you can heat up by yourself at home. But overal the food is warm enough, after driving 25 minutes to my home. …"
18,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Really nice Japanese restaurant, with great food. Service took sometimes a bit of time, but the great taste of the food made totally up for that!"
19,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great, tradition Japanese restaurant, tucked away right across the RAI.

With welcoming (mostly Japanese) staff, and incredible food. One of the few …"
20,Hakata Senpachi, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"I was looking forward to have dinner here, the food i had was good but quite pricey, and maybe was only tonight but the service was really messy, and way too many people standing waiting to be sestet, had to wait 20 min for a beer (asking …"
21,Hakata Senpachi, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"We went a year ago and highly rated the ramen. Went today and extremely disappointed - noodles were cheaper, broth weaker and came with hardly any additional bits and pieces in the soup. 36 euro for 2 soups, tea and water - poor."
22,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic Japanese restaurant with a great choice of really the best dishes. We were amazed by the roasted eggplant topped with a great taste of miso. The staff is super friendly and can definitely advice you about the menu. And don't wear your new clothes! It's quite smokey inside
23,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food. First visit. First time we tasted fresh wasabi (amazing). You have to order via a paper sheet were you ticked the meal and the number you want. Typical Japanese grilled, scallops were tasteless. Quick service and personnel very …"
24,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"You are in Amsterdam but when you get inside you feel like you’re inside a restaurant in Japan. Authentic vibes & food, topped with good service. It is properly run to the delight of Japanese food enthusiasts. Keep up the good work Hakata Senpachi."

Shitake mushrooms garlic oil and Yam with fresh wasabi were great, as the …"
27,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great authentic taste with a great selection of filling mains and skewers. Great selection of japanese liquor as well. The inner section can be pretty smokey, so sit on the terras if there are eye or breathing sensitivity."
28,Hakata Senpachi, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"After a long block down period, yesterday was the first time for I and my hubby to go out for a diner outside, and we decided to give us the first time to our most favorite Japanese restaurant--SENPACHI, we ordered a table in the terras at …"
29,Hakata Senpachi, 3 stars ,3 years ago,3.5 First of all...bring your own wasabi they charged 3euro for a small dish (like soysauce dish) and it was pretty tasteless...no wasabi kick at all. The yakitori was oretty good but i loved their ramen. Good and flavourful.
30,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice and tasty Japanese food! Didn’t expect they have also quite some options for vegetarians also in a Japanese kitchen, highly recommended to Japanese food lovers!"

Staff is friendly, fast and kind. …"
33,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The fried chicken in sauce was decent! The ramen was also very tasty. I ordered cold soba as well. That one was a bit plain in taste but after adding the complimentary sauce the taste seemed ok.
34,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What is this place?! How can they serve such an authentic and tasty Japanese food in Europe?! It’s really magic. :D Now I don’t need to miss Japanese food anymore...because I can come back here any time. :)
35,Hakata Senpachi, 2 stars ,2 months ago,Service was friendly and fast. Ramen broth had no flavor and was fatty.  Kimchi was poorly flavored and watery. Gyoza lacked seasoning in the filling as well as the Tsukune.
36,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good Japanese Restaurant in Amsterdam.

We have been here several times. Once for dinner and many times for lunch. …"
37,Hakata Senpachi, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Location was easy to find. Not many options for lunch and quite expensive. Got charged for two orders of tea but was only one teapot. Staff was ok.

39,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Never been to Japan but the experience of this food made me travel a little. The eel and black ice cream are a must order! You are welcome ;-)
40,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Had lunch at the place. They do have lunch menu which is around ramen (Japanese noodle). Not so much variety while dinner menu seems to be more. Taste is authentic with my Asian tongue. Service lady was lovely. Also good for family with young kids. Will stop by from time to time for sure.

48,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Great hibachi (charkoal grill) place! Took the foiegrois which was to die for. Tasty ramen to top it off.
49,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Really good oldschool homestyle Japanese Restaurant. We had some skewers with chicken and chicken skin and it was perfectly grilled on charcoal, nice and tender, and the juices just dripped off. Also the gyozas and the Karaage were super …"

The moment you step in , you are immediately taken to a Tokyo neighbourhood ramen place. Food is good , service is fast, ambience is smoky!!"
53,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,The best Ramen in town. Chef Hiro san is a passionate talented and dedicated professional who brought the authentic Izakaya atmosphere (pub in japanese) to Amsterdam with a great sake selection and dishes. I highly recommend this place.
54,Hakata Senpachi, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Forgot half of our orders. We were waiting without food like 1 hour at the terrace. Very overpriced - We paid 47euros for two, still not full and only drank 2 beers in total. Food tastes exactly the same if you do bbq at home with teriyaki …"
55,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is like being in Japan. The environment is very similar and you could try a really good quality food and of course you will eat really special Japanese dishes. Very recommendable!
56,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Each of Yakitori is in decent level as well as chicken nanban(fried chicken with tartare source). Chicken nanban was a bigger portion than expected, I couldn’t reach ramen."
57,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good yakitori. Wear cheap clothes, because you will smell like a bbq"
58,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good quality ramen and gyoza. Good selection of drinks. Kind service.
59,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best and most authentic Japanese food I've had in Amsterdam. The tonkotsu smells and tastes like its been painstakingly boiled for days, and the pork is just sublime, well-marinated, ultra tender, with just the right amounts of fat in …"
60,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Not cheap, but the most authentic Japanese izakaya style place in Amsterdam!"
61,Hakata Senpachi, 3 stars ,2 years ago,It was really little for a main course. I'm used to Udon soup with a lot more filling. The soup tasted good though.
62,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Food was delicious, but because they are making barbecue inside and have very bad ventilation it was difficult to breath there."
63,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Plenty of choice for ramen and yakitori but really overpriced. Good selection of umeshu and sake. The place is a bit smokey inside but it gives a lot of atmosphere, raccomended"

73,Hakata Senpachi, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Booked a table for 13:30 and the kitchen wasn’t ready at all, grilled dishes and sashimi weren’t available..
Good ramens and curry but don’t order the wagyu, the meat was hard to chew, I …"
74,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A lovely authentic Japanese gem, with kind and helpful staff. Tastiest ramen I have tried in Amsterdam so far, with all the drink options I've been craving for. The yakitori I tried also fulfilled all the expectations. Great place :>"
75,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Delicious food and drinks, but quite pricey. Service can be a bit slow (especially when busy, and it usually is), so you have to be quite patient."
76,Hakata Senpachi, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Worst experience ever in a restaurant. Came with a reservation for two with a table inside. They had us waiting 30 minutes to sit us outside. Then they had us waiting another 30 minutes to order, and then they told us the grill was too busy and we couldnt order any food. Still had to pay for our two beers."
77,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,So far I tried only the ramen and it was delicious. The service was good and the staff was friendly. I will definitely go back for some yakitori.
78,Hakata Senpachi, 1 star ,3 years ago,No taste and very expensive. Only edame and gyozas were good.
79,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best yakitori so far in EU
80,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is the most authentic Japanese restaurant I’ve been in Amsterdam! Can’t recommend it more 😍
81,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place ain’t cheap (in contrast to what it would probably be were you actually in Japan) but nonetheless, it’s as authentic as it gets: Amsterdam’s most authentic Japanese arguably."
82,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best Izakaya in town!!!Gyutan is my favorite!cold udon also nice, next time will try the Ramen"
83,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food! Would definitely recommend!
84,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really great food. I got kinda scared of the octopus balls tho (like meat balls but made of octopus) because the octopus flakes on it were still moving. Menu is a little hard to understand because I still only understood half of the English …
85,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,a year ago,"We just had some food here, Ramen. The food was good. Could be a bit more hot (e.g. the 🥚 in my ramen). However, the staff was really good and they are taking this Covid-19 time very, very seriously. Everyone is wearing a 😷 and they are cleaning extremely well. I was really impressed. So thank you for that, guys. See you soon."
86,Hakata Senpachi, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great vibes, really good atmosphere, but food was mediocre. Edamame was microwaved I think, sashimi was pre-prepared hours before I think ... didn't seem that fresh and some of the pieces were a little chewy. Yakatori was a little …"
87,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Sometimes I hesitate sharing this place with people because I am afraid that everyone is going to flock there, realize how amazing it is and it would be a nightmare to get a table. :-P …"
88,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place has absolutely fantastic food. The grilled aubergine with fish flakes blew me away.
Do yourself a favor and try the fried chicken as well, both the marinated and …"
89,Hakata Senpachi, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food seems fine, service is poor. Waitress and waiter were nice and attentive but kitchen was slow. It took around 90 minutes for all of our dishes to finally be served. A bit on the pricey side but nothing crazy. Although I might be back, …"
90,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was a great and authentic Japanese experience.

The food was absolutely tasty. They have a wide variety of food with excellent quality. Their sake selection was amazing and the employees were very kind."

92,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is really among the best Japanese in Amsterdam. Lots of choices from cheap to expensive. Staff was super friendly too. It's busy, but you won't have to wait long for your food at all."
93,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Crowded place, but good atmosphere, seats at tables and along the kitchen counter. Quick and friendly staff, helpful. Very good and juicy kushiyaki of chicken (yakitori), beef, shiitake and pork belly (awesome, especially the miso). Three …"
94,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Their karaage chicken is very good. Ramen not so excellent, then again- it’s not their speciality. Will be trying the skewers next!"
95,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Izakaya style atmosphere. Good selection of Japanese draft beers. Service is quick. Food is cooked to order. Highly recommend the yakitori(skewers) and seasonal menus. Ramen broths are also rich in flavor and probably the best tonkatsu ramen in Amsterdam. Walk ins discouraged- almost always booked at peak times.
96,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best Izakaya style Japanese authentic bar and restaurant. Every foods are top quality. Foie-gras with eel is tremendous.     Ramen also top quality.
97,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I only had ramen and some side dishes so I can not give an overall review but the Tonkotsu ramen featured yuzu flavor which I do not think it is typical in Hakata but it was very delicious. Service is not open for lunch during lunch time, …"
98,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The website is in Japanese, the menu is in Japanese and the food... Japanese quality. Simply a great place. Don't wear your delicate dress, because your clothes will smell after a visit to this place."
99,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good service, great atmosphere and excellent food :) please do not leave without trying their unagi!"
100,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best Japanese restaurants in Amsterdam! My cousin and his friend came here, upon returning from an long term exchange in Japan: they were really pleased!
Highly recommend"
101,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great experience. You're basically sitting next to the guy that prepares all the skewers on a little grill that you would see at a typical food stall. Not an average Japanese restaurant Hardly any seafood and no sushi, but delicious dishes …"
102,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,One of the best ramen and japenese cuisine restaurants I have ever been too. It's kind of a hidden gem but so good. Its expensive but worth it
103,Hakata Senpachi, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Overpriced and food came very slowly. The terrace looks cheap, not aligned with the prices. Food was good but not sure I'll go back."
104,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Not your average sushi place! I am not Japanese, so can't vouch for authenticity; but certainly felt truly Japanese! Food awesome, great variety and unique tastes. Try the eggplant and tomato+ bacon."
105,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing ramen and super friendly staff, definitely recommend 👍"
106,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really delicious authentic japanese food! Because of the grill inside the restaurant, it smells a bit, but that was not a problem for us. The food and nice service was better than we expected :)"
107,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing Izakaya near RAI. Come with friends and order everything. All delicious!!
108,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very good but the parking nearby is not so nice.
109,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Top quality food! Since I've been once, it's been my favorite restaurant since! The nanban chicken and shoyu ramen are excellent!"
110,Hakata Senpachi, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Don’t come here if you want to be full, the main dish is like the size of side dish - same thing different ways of grilling one is side dish another one is main dish. Also, we can’t breath due to the smoke (by grilling) in the restaurant and the waitresses either don’t understand English or with unfriendly attitude."
111,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is EXACTLY like the kinda yakitori you will get in Japan. Shio salted flavours only. It was the best Japanese meal I have had in Europe all these years.. we also got sashimis and karage fried chicken too. My favourite (aside from the …
112,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,After trying so many other ramen places in Amsterdam we always end up at Senpachi. It’s really the best in town!
113,Hakata Senpachi, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We made a reservation for Valentine's day to have dinner with my family of 4. We did so 8 days before. They could not find our reservation. We showed them the phonecall we made to the restaurant on the 6th and they did believed us, that we …"
114,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,Probably the best Japanese restaurant in Amsterdam. Really subtle combinations of flavors and great variety of sake. Very authentic.
115,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,8 months ago,The deep fried aubergine with miso paste is amazing and the wagyu bowl was loved
116,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Just as if you are in a Izakaya in Japan! The food was delicious and the staff very friendly. I am definitely coming back to try more dishes. Arigato!
117,Hakata Senpachi, 1 star ,2 years ago,Solo discrimination - Initially I booked a table for 3 and I called for a quantity change to 1p due to last minute cancellation. First reaction on the phone is that I will be moved to the counter because I am alone. No apologies nor an …

120,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food at Hakata Senpachi is some of the best Japanese food I’ve had in Amsterdam. Service was friendly (maybe not the fastest) and it got pretty smokey from the grill, but the food was well worth it."
121,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Love this place. Grill mackerel is so good, I alone can eat at least 2.

Also there is a wide variety of plum wine selection."
122,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent service, great food, and not expensive. I'd definitely recommend this place, well above the other Japanese restaurants in the area. Other people commented that it's smokey inside, but I didn't find that."
123,Hakata Senpachi, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very bad experience today compared with previously visiting. Fish is not fresh, and grill is over cooked. Asked napkin, but they forgot to give us. Inside environment is not health with lots of smoke. Waiter is not customer focus, and not polite. Not recmend people come."
124,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Real authentic Japanese food at a casual price and wide selection of Sake chosen by the master chef Hiro.  Restaurant is owned and managed by Japanese so you can feel you are in Hakata, southern city of Japan, once you step inside."
125,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This is definitely my favourite authentic Japanese restaurant in Amsterdam. It has an Izakaya vibe, which I really like and sometimes it even felt like I was in Japan again! …"
126,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"There's nothing like Senpachi anywhere in Europe, as far as I know. It's an izakaya the way you would find them among the best ones in Japan. …"
127,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came here for ramen but it's more like an izakaya - Japanese bar. Very nice food. Sashimi excellent. Yakatori very nice. Very cold beer. 🍺
128,Hakata Senpachi, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was decent but the service was atrocious! 45 mins to receive our order while other patrons that came a lot later than us, and were incidentally Japanese men, were served significantly before us.  Mixed up our order as well, more than once we did not receive the dishes we ordered. Would not recommend this place to people who"
129,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Was recommended to this place by a colleague and must say it did not disappoint. Had the weekend ramen lunch and it was excellent. Broth was rich and excellent when combined with the ramen. A true east in the west, will have to come back for their yakitori dinner"
130,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The best Tonkotsu ramen I've ever eaten in country other than Japan.
Basically Tonkotsu ramens in the overseas don't have Umami in the soup but this ramen has and they use good quality noodles."
131,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,Excellent Ramen. Just like we had in Kyoto couple of years back. It’s an authentic Japanese restaurant.
132,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Pricey, the yakitori was good though."
133,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Amsterdam. Delicious food. Try the skewered chicken skin.
Reservations are good idea, as this place gets busy."
134,Hakata Senpachi, 3 stars ,a year ago,"I have been going to this place for many years. Unfortunately the portions seem to become smaller every month, and the service level isn’t that good anymore. Only when the ‘older’ lady is working the service is outstanding."
135,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place bit Smokey an bit of a long wait but overall excellent food
136,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Ordered yesterday. Unbelievably good, even the salads. Made with love, patience and knowhow. Highly recommended."

138,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Every dish was well-prepared. Loved the food. Ate too many dishes because I wanted to try more so it got a bit expensive. But worth it!
139,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,My favorite Japanese restaurant in Amsterdam. Very popular with Japanese  expats. Senpachi specialises in grilled dishes so don't expect any sushi.
140,Hakata Senpachi, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I enjoy the visit because it reminded me that I was back in Japan as I could speak Japanese with some of the staff. Felt really nice and nostalgic. Food was good.
141,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My favorite Japanese izakaya (pub). They grill their skewers to order, and their selection of sake/Japanese beers is top notch! Make a reservation for Fridays and weekends."
142,Hakata Senpachi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A hidden gem in Amsterdam, a real ‘chefs like to eat place’. From the excellent approach to cooking on a open charcoal grill, through to the authentic drinks or weekend ramen."

152,Hakata Senpachi, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food is very good but service has space for improvement.
