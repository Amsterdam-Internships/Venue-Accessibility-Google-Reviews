0,Adam & Siam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The service was excellent. The boys were outstanding. The drinks were awesome. The food was just yummy and by far the best place we ate in Amsterdam.we just loved the atmosphere there.
1,Adam & Siam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Just ok. Nothing special and wouldn't go out of my way. Liked the decor, seating and the friendly staff but the menu is meh....tried fried prawns with rice, massaman curry with fries (why would there be thin fries with a curry?!) And the …"
2,Adam & Siam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,We had a great night here. The food is a nice mix of European and Asian (Thai) and the staff is helpful and reasonably efficient. We'll be back.
3,Adam & Siam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent Asian restaurants, a few steps away from Dam square! Cosy atmosphere, tasty curry and friendly staff, makes a great combo for a lovely evening with colleagues."
4,Adam & Siam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"East meets west menu. The east were more to Chinese than Thai ... well, at least those that we ordered. Well prepared & delicious. The high ceiling dining hall is at the back portion, the front is a bar, serving Heineken, Affligem & such. Feel free to write a postcard (provided), and they'll deliver for free. Proost!"
5,Adam & Siam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cosy place with a mix of Dutch and Eastern food. Friendly service.
6,Adam & Siam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty expensive and not a lot of options. However, the food was good in quantity and quality. A pity that I paid 10 euros for a small chocolate cake, ruined with a lot of unwanted decorative additions."
7,Adam & Siam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This is not a restaurant with East meets West concept, but rather two separate menus, so you can choose the cuisine you prefer.
The food was good, especially the dessert - mango sticky rice."
8,Adam & Siam, 2 stars ,a year ago,The location and the inside ambiance is good but the food was quite disappointing considering the high price. Beef and chicken were quite dry and my dish had very little taste. We had to pay for the water even though we specifically asked for tap water. The positive note was the soup which was very tasty.
9,Adam & Siam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very tasty Tom GA Kai! The place was full when we arrived but the waiters served our table fast anyway.
10,Adam & Siam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and nice atmosphere. Service is ok, fast and friendly.
It was not very crowded, that's why lot of friends of the waiters were gathered around the bar, making lot of noise and not considering the comfort of guests. …"
11,Adam & Siam, 4 stars ,5 years ago,A mix between Western and Asian food in an atmospheric setting right in the city center of Amsterdam.
12,Adam & Siam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice decoration and cozy ambiance. The staff was friendly and spoke fluent english. The food and drinks were absolutely delicious   : we had spring rolls and the crispy fried beef topped with their homemade lemonade.
13,Adam & Siam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Visited here with my Thai partner and we both loved the food. The restaurant was nice enough to allow us to choose from the dinner menu at lunch time so we had more choice and the food was lovely. I ordered the green curry and it was tasty …
14,Adam & Siam, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely setting, average food"
15,Adam & Siam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing spot in the centre. As a spicy-dishes enthousiast, I really enjoyed the curries. It's great for groups, and also great options for people who are not into Asian food. Will definitely come back here!"
16,Adam & Siam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice staff and nice food. They did however remove the Thai-Dutch fusion portion of their menu, which I found disappointing. Last year I enjoyed their mussels dish, hope they bring it back."
17,Adam & Siam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Felt a bit excluded on a table at the front rather than the busier back, where you can see the bar etc. But, really good food. The chicken was a big portion, with plenty of rice, and tasted really good, with a lasting zing, and the wagyu …"
18,Adam & Siam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good service and fair food, but nothing special. If you want traditional Thai food I'd recommend you look elsewhere. The menu is split between American style dishes (burgers, ribs etc) and Thai. The selection of either is rather limited."
19,Adam & Siam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A nice enough place; if you're looking for somewhere a bit more classy than the cafes and proeflokaals then I'd recommend it, but the beer selection is quite limited, and the atmosphere on a Friday night wasn't quite what we were looking …"
20,Adam & Siam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Me and my friend enjoyed a variation of curries, which were tasty and aromatic. We had a couple of ginger beers and Aperol Spritz as well. Nothing out of the ordinary. Friendly staff, reasonably priced, great for a quick dinner."
21,Adam & Siam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Adam & Siam is an excellent Thai restaurant.
It doesn't look like an Asian restaurant but the food is excellent and really spicy if you want to eat spicy food. …"
22,Adam & Siam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Eating outside ( if weather is good) in the middle of Rokin square, tasty food.  We tried the Thai menu, and we were all really happy with that. Prices around 20-25 € per person"
23,Adam & Siam, 2 stars ,4 years ago,A bit pricy for the quality of dishes you get. I mean curry was fine but then they charge additional 5 euro if you need more rice. Really? You order 19 EUR dish and they can't give you free bowl of rice? Chicken dish my wife got was quite …
24,Adam & Siam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was really good when it arrived! We waited 40 minutes for a club sandwich and a Cobb salad. Lovely,friendly staff and great place to sit outside and people watch!"

28,Adam & Siam, 3 stars ,4 years ago,They have great food but service is a bit slow. They charge too much for what they serve.
29,Adam & Siam, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was decent but it took forever to come through - we ordered, it took 15mins to bring out our starters but then an hour+ to bring out our mains even asking twice where it is... I don't think I'd recommend this place..."
30,Adam & Siam, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Waitress woman left us a menu, 10 mins later when she came to ask our order, she said its wrong menu and handed another one, left without even saying a sorry.
Also too loud music for a restaurant.."
31,Adam & Siam, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Look, i am sure that the burgers and sandwiches are great. But that is not why i am here. Because would u really go to a place nameD ""Adam & SIAM"" for burgers? No. U would go here for thaifood or some fusion. Especially when this is …"

33,Adam & Siam, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Great service, great location, but the burger with fries was one of the worst I've had in a restaurant. It also cost me 15€"
34,Adam & Siam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing Thai food. Lovely staff
35,Adam & Siam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice rib! Went there the second time just for the rib.

37,Adam & Siam, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The food and the atmosphere were nice but the service was truly terrible, they took a long time to serve us and at the end when we asked to split the bill they were very rude and unfriendly."

39,Adam & Siam, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Service very slow....they like to chat a lot with  special guests and not taking care of all. Takes all very long...to order food about 30 minutes to get food about 3/4 of an hour...only because they standing around...and not so busy...but food is good

44,Adam & Siam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Service slow. Felt they where taking care of the locals first and then the tourists. Food ok but not really worth the price
45,Adam & Siam, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Ambience was nice, but it was not enough to make up for the bad customer service and food that’s not worth the amount your paying for."
