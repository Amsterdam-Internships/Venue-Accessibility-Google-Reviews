0,Oosterling, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"cosy caf√©
friendly bartender"
1,Oosterling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best brown caf√©s. Definitely worth a visit to have a taste of the local Amsterdam
2,Oosterling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice and cozy traditional place. A selection of over 50 different beers. An old-school bartender you can chat with. Seating outside also available. Check it out.
3,Oosterling, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Used to live above here. Very nice, simple casual place. Not big. Generally quiet but trams are loud. Sells beverages to go as well (soda/wine)."
4,Oosterling, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Ideal for a drink in the sun after shopping, however, its true, they can be a bit slow with orders."
5,Oosterling, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Experience of Dutch bar and spirits. Highly recommended
6,Oosterling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely small pub with great selection of drinks.
7,Oosterling, 5 stars ,a year ago,Comfortable and very cozy on a chilly rainy day. Sat beneath the casks and chatted with the owner who was very welcoming. Delicious array of ciders and beers.
8,Oosterling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Easily one of the best Brown Caf√©s in Amsterdam. A traditional old boozer. The owner is delightful, the beer is incredible and there's something for everyone, the weizen is particularly good if you enjoy a wheat beer. An absolute must visit."
9,Oosterling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great spot.  Very old spot.  Patrons were professionals,  parents, kids, foreigners, etc.
No music or tv,  just conversations.  Last place in town that operates as a liquor store as well. Great selections, vibe with friendly service"
10,Oosterling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I would rate this as a typical Amsterdam brown caf√©. It has a long history and has been around for generations; over 150 years. Barman Oscar, an Oosterling descendant, was fun to have a chat with. We visited Oosterling early afternoon, really enjoyed it. The classic, quintessential, Barfly completed my afternoon."
11,Oosterling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I find it the most relaxing and social place in Amsterdam. If you're looking for authentic, it's the place to visit. Stop by and have a laugh with the proprietors. Friendly and approachable all. Ask advice about the city and where you should visit. Of course, they don't wish you to leave. Have fun! üòä"
12,Oosterling, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Stopped by for a drink and sandwich on a Sunday.
Obviously not a place to do this on a Sunday.
Super slow service . ‚Ä¶"
13,Oosterling, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Typical old-style Dutch cafe/bar. Very friendly staff, they set up some tables on the outside to keep with the local regulations, and they went the extra mile to serve me a ginger tea on a Friday evening."
14,Oosterling, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great old distillery turned brown bar. Nice terrace, good service and tasty beer. They also sell off license if you need a late night bottle of wine or liquor."
15,Oosterling, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A very very great and classic place to have a drink. Very local, not touristy at all!"
16,Oosterling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Those places that you can spend a whole day with People Watching! Cosy, warm, welcome and has been in the family for 300 years. Great variety of Beers, Wines and Spirits"
17,Oosterling, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really nice little pub, very cosy. Staff are extremely nice. There's a big screen for sports and outdoor seating. The beers are quite nice and fairly cheap for Amsterdam."
18,Oosterling, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Very nice brown caf√©
19,Oosterling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It does not get any better. If in love with traditional Dutch bars, go here and enjoy the typically Dutch assortment and hospitality. And do not forget to order the balletje Loes..."
20,Oosterling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great old bar, have a headbanger when you stop in."
21,Oosterling, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Been here on a couple of trips. Really nice atmosphere. Proper Amsterdamer experience. Good selection of drinks. Nice loo. Staff are awesome. They even put up with my dodgy Dutch. Pop into Cafe Bouwmann en route (Utrechtsestrasse), but end up HIER! X"
22,Oosterling, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Ancient brown cafe and one of the very few remaining in Amsterdam that still has a license to sell bottles of spirits.  Nice spot for sitting outside.
23,Oosterling, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Oosterling is one of a kind. The bar breathes the old days. Superb personell. Also late night liquor store! But the best thing might be the general atmosphere, which is really relaxed and amsterdam-ish. :-) highly recommended!"
24,Oosterling, 5 stars ,a year ago,"For my friends and me, Oosterling is like a second living room. The people who work there are all masters of the pub trade."
25,Oosterling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A very local brown cafe. Very nice atmosphere, and very good/attentive service. Tasty Brand (beer) on tap too!"
26,Oosterling, 5 stars ,6 years ago,When I lived in Amsterdam in the late 1970s this was my favourite bar - does anyone else remember those days. So pleased the Oosterling is still well thought of.
27,Oosterling, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This is one of the few bars that serve Apple Bandit hard cider. I luv the stuff. The bartender was cool and the atmosphere relaxed.
28,Oosterling, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Recently awarded with the best meat ball of Amsterdam. So definitely try that one. Classic Amsterdam atmosphere.
29,Oosterling, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"If you like beer, visit this cafe in old style. Don't expect any dancing because they don't play any music."
30,Oosterling, 5 stars ,2 years ago,If I am in Amsterdam I go there. One of the oldest pubs in town. No music. Go there.
