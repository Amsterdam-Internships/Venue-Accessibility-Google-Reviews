0,New York Pizza, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Its what you can expect from ny. They put too much salt on the dough though.
1,New York Pizza, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The pizza is tasty and cheap. 10 euros for a full, small size pizza ( 6 slices, more than enough for one person). The only problem is that you can't sit here and eat, they don't allow it. So you either sit outside on a bench or take away. Since this is close to my house, I thought it's better to just order in from next time onwards."
2,New York Pizza, 1 star ,9 months ago,don't bother ordering. you will be receiving a below average pizza after 90 min.
3,New York Pizza, 3 stars ,a year ago,Pizza was delivered too dry last orders. Used to like the place. Pleas stop saving on sauce :)

10,New York Pizza, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Bad quality of service, and rude. Pizza was totally average, only good thing was the price."
11,New York Pizza, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The only time I came here the staff was super friendly and nice, and the pizza didn't take long, so a very good service and food."
