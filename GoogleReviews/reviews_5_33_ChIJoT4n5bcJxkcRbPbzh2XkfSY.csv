0,5&33, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great bar with fun cocktails. Fabulous interior design with very cool art. Dinner menu is limited but we enjoyed our entrees. We chose the lamb and duck which were really. The spaghetti with lobster was pretty bland.

27,5&33, 4 stars ,a year ago,"One of my favorite hotels for drinks and food. Nice music, nice lounge and decent service.
-1 star for no smoking room.
Not the same anymore."
28,5&33, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Was a great night of good food. Just a view thinks though!! We wanted the main course Lamb of the truffle menu but we could only order that with the whole truffle menu so not very flexible in that unfortunately as I am used to the American …
29,5&33, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Tasty lunch and cocktail
30,5&33, 1 star ,2 years ago,"There was no table anymore and the kitchen closed at ten, so we ate dinner somewhere else and came back. The service in the bar area is terrible. We did wait for an hour for our cocktails, really! Everyone is very far apart, no mingling. There's a DJ, but it's not good. Go anywhere else, even MacDonald's is better!!"
31,5&33, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food and drinks were nice, and reasonably priced.  I found the service outstanding!  From the moment we arrived, we felt very welcomed at the front desk. The bar staff and waiters were all friendly and gave us a good amount of time to make our choices. They really made our evening, thank you :) Would highly recommend."
32,5&33, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great service and beautiful ambiance!
33,5&33, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"They messed up our order but were brilliant at making it up to us - all our drinks and sides were comped. The manager was awesome. However, some of his team could do with retraining as initially they were slow to react to our concerns. Overall a positive experience."

37,5&33, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Surprisingly big space, but predictably great food. The lobster spaghetti had lots of lobster, and the wine was excellent. Dessert portions were small but tasty. The seating at the tables near the fireplace was awkward"
38,5&33, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Overpriced, over rated and deafening from loud drum n Bass music.
The starters were ok but tiny portions,  my main course was a disaster.  Really, I mean totaly lacking of any flavour or tast whatsoever and again tiny portion, …"
39,5&33, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"5&33 is a very nice restaurant, with good ambiance and fire place makes it feel a warm welcome. Staff was very polite and helpful as restaurant was full eventhough they manage to find us a table. Drinks choise in the menu was extended and …"
40,5&33, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The food (steak) was really good! Perfectly cooked, nicely flavoured - no complaints whatsoever. Service was also perfect. However, I found the really loud music extremely annoying. The place is classy, but the music makes it feel cheap (which price-wise it sure wasn't)."
41,5&33, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"OK place for lunch, nothing special and small serving sizes. The art exobition is a nice added value and the place looks great from the inside. During lunch we were seated at low tables which is not very convenient to eat and discus business."
42,5&33, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Went there on truffle tuesday. The decor feels cheap and tacky. The food was ok. Nothing special really. You pay 20 Euros and get a plate of pasta with truffle (very little of it) and a glass of champagne. The worst is the service. They are …
43,5&33, 1 star ,2 years ago,We celebrated New Years Eve at 5&33 with four persons and it was a disaster. We reserved a table and that came with a minimum spent of €600. Arriving at the venue we had to wait for over …
44,5&33, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Interesting collection of gins, and other cocktail stuff. Bar staff so-so (not quite aware of that they had to offer). Staff does not speak - or want to speak? - Dutch. Really nice food. Trendy atmosphere. Great cooking. Enjoyed it although bit too hip for me."
45,5&33, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is my favourite bar to get a cocktail when I feel like having a cocktail by myself. The atmosphere is nice,  techno music and the staff knows their stuff. You can get bar snacks till quit late , don't know the exact time."
46,5&33, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Just one of the nicest place in town. Central location, stylish, great cocktail area with nice DJ, cool dining side, great food and wines. The open kitchen is a great touch. Definitely recommended"
47,5&33, 1 star ,7 years ago,"Went there on a late dinner date on a Friday night. Fact that their kitchen works until 11pm was basically the only positive thing. Designed and envisioned nicely, this place falls short in most basic thing you expect from a restaurant …"
48,5&33, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Liked this place. It was in my hotel during this stay. Service is good but not great. Meal falls I tot he same category. I'm from the US and accustomed to a bit more responsiveness on from the wait staff so that's why they lost a star. Too knotch atmosohere and a convenient location.
49,5&33, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I can not find a zero star or minus stars ! Waitress was aggressive and offending. We booked for 12 and finally were 9, we drunk 5 bottles of wine and they charged us for 12 people !!! Never again"
50,5&33, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really tasty foods. For breakfast, there is a wide variety of foods. Although the atmosphere is a little too dark, the place is very artistic. Along with the hotel it's part of, it is simply a nice experience for a not-so-small cost."
51,5&33, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ordered lobster spaghetti, rib eye and sweet potato soup. All are tasty. Service was good. Location is right opposite to the central station. Environment is very good too"
52,5&33, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The bar area situated in the Art Hotel, nice signature cocktails,

They got a hidden smoke room, with a great interior and good ventilation."
53,5&33, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I really liked the food and the staff!
54,5&33, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Terrible! We ordered Moscow mules, they  gave us essentially lemonade. It tasted like lime, not ginger beer and it had no vodka inside.
A pity because the waitress was really polite."
55,5&33, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was quite delicious but the server was pretty non-existent since there was a large party there that night.  We paid the bill and left the cash on the table. An hour later, the server called us to accuse us of skipping on the bill. …"
56,5&33, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Pricey but friendly staff
57,5&33, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"nice cozy place near library, but too hot near the fireplace, the cocktails are very “light”, the music is too loud. Looks like a posh place, but doesn’t match the expectations."
58,5&33, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Incredibly stylish place and wonderful forthcoming staff. They can compete with places like Café Beaubourg in Paris or the Grand here in Amsterdam as it comes to dining and menu. Pricewise it's even better. Thank you for making the experience unforgettable
59,5&33, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A high end but welcoming and laid-back place. Excellent food and snacks enjoyed their entertainment, the djs are rocking the place on weekends. Sweet staff make you feel at home."
60,5&33, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Awesome venue, love the atmosphere - went on Saturday night during Earth Hour and they used only candles to light the restaurant, they also had a live singer and saxophone player. Awesome night ! Get the Truffle pasta !"
61,5&33, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We made a reservation for new-years eve. They asked for creditcard details which is unusual for this country, but not really an issue for me. The food was great and we had a great experience while we were there."
62,5&33, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Terrible experience. Not only did the main course take about 1,5 hours to receive. It was supposed to be for two persons but was barely enough for 1 person.
The waiter did not show any interest in us besides serving alcohol. …"
63,5&33, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Awful, awful management. I made a reservation for two for new-year's eve dinner before I started travelling. At the eleventh hour they sent me an email demanding that I printed, signed and scanned a pdf form with my credit card details. I …"
64,5&33, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice restaurant in front of Amsterdam station.
If you need a very quiet and cozy place to scape the loud and busy city. At night you need to make a reservation."
