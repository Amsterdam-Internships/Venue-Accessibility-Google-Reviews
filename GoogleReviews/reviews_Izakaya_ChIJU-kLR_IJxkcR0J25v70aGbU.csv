0,Izakaya, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Vibe is good. Loud music so it’s more a place to get there and meet some new people but not really able to discuss much. The food is delicious. My favorites are the king crab miso , spinach salad with prawns and just discovered the cabbage …"
1,Izakaya, 5 stars ,a month ago,"We got 7 course menu, which was a pretty good choice.
Every dish was unique and delicious.
I found the service fine and the waiters were friendly. …"
2,Izakaya, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Went today for anniversary and the experience was nice even thought I was disappointed because they spilled all over the table my cocktail ( a small glass for 16 euro ) and didn’t offered me to change it or refill it and I spend the whole …
3,Izakaya, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Food was very nice, not cheap but it is hip and trendy, so it is as could be aspected. We had a full lunch with 6 courses and two bottles of wine, when we refilled our glasses with the bottle from our wine cooler, it ended up not being our …"
4,Izakaya, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Good food, but it is supposed to be good for this kind of money. Service is lacking sometimes, they're just not alert, seemingly busy with anything but the guests. Good music but pretty loud, what's the point of that in the afternoon? To be …"
5,Izakaya, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Exceptional! Every dish looked and tasted amazing. One of the best in Amsterdam, worth every penny."
6,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Oh my god. We really wanted to visit this restaurant after reading the recommandations. We decided to come at lunch hour hoping to get more space and time for this food experience. This turned out to be a great idea. Everything on the menu …
7,Izakaya, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"This place is all smoke & mirrors. My mother in law waited over an hour for her sea bass and we had all finished with our meals. The mushroom pot was so bland and totally simple, I don’t know how they think it’s ethical to charge 36 euros …"
8,Izakaya, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice Asian/Peruvian fusion restaurant in Amsterdam. The food is good and the menu is very long with plenty of choices.
Desserts were the highlight, really a good combination of textures flavors. …"
9,Izakaya, 1 star ,4 months ago,"That’s definitely NOT sushi. The sashimi consists of small pieces of fish swimming in sauce partially cooked by the acidity. The rolls were OK, but not worthy the price tag. …"
10,Izakaya, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Unlike traditional izakayas where the food shines through its natural presentation and letting ingredients speak for themselves, this restaurant opted to douse most of their dishes with strong flavours, overpowering most of the often …"
11,Izakaya, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Too expensive for small and mediocre dishes and unfriendly waitress too.
12,Izakaya, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I had a lovely dinner here on a thursday evening. It's a fancy, slightly posh-feeling restaurant. It was very busy and they had loud electronic music being dj-ed live. That wasn't so amazing, but I can see the appeal for some. The service …"
13,Izakaya, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best place in Amsterdam so far. The spinach salad is unbelievably good, with truffle oil and parmesan cheese. The 3 kind of sashimi is my favorite. I don’t really like the music they have (too fashion for me) and is a little noise but the food is great. Very recommended!"
14,Izakaya, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Got a last minute bar seating during a busy Friday night. Great vibe - music might be a tad too loud lol but you get used to it after awhile. Our bartender, Vincenzo, made us amazing drinks and gave food recommendations that were perfect …"
15,Izakaya, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great decor, bustling vibe, beautiful waitresses. The food is Japanese fusion and it's quite good. The salad with prawn, miso, parmesan and truffle was very good, but I thought other dishes were ordinary (the aburi salmon nigiri) but others …"
16,Izakaya, 1 star ,6 months ago,"could have been so good if not for the service

We had high hopes but the service smashed them up. …"
17,Izakaya, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Aw man, surprisingly delicious. And not just that, staff super friendly and extra shoutout to the bartenders as they are really cool, attentive and knowledgeable about what the choose food wise and drink wise. One note, guys it’s ok to …"
18,Izakaya, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing food and ambiance!
The Staff is very Friendly and the vibes there are Chic and funky
You should go at least once!"
19,Izakaya, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Definitely not a cheap place, but very nice food! Fresh fish, huge menu, interesting twist. Also cocktails are pretty good"
20,Izakaya, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great athmosohere and music. Good food. Service is worth recommendation. The desserts were exceptional! Prices are high.

23,Izakaya, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"The cocktails are amazing, the atmosphere is great and the staff is extraordinarily friendly. The place had an amazing view of the canal, you can enjoy. The prices are good."
24,Izakaya, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Hostesses are unskilled and unkind. They are incapable of making people feel welcome. Which is an essential part of being a hostess. They portray an old-fashioned image. Showing a lot of skin, a lot of ""couldn't care about the guest"" and …"
25,Izakaya, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty decent fish, lovely place to sit outside and eat, quite expensive - a hotel restaurant attached to the Sir Albert, so extended hours. Fancy cocktails: great mahattan."
26,Izakaya, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"The food was just awful. Beef tataki was only taste like a vinegar and you will have this taste till the next morning in your mouth !!! Squats had 0 taste at all, and their most popular dish on fried rice with some tar tar… you have only …"
27,Izakaya, 1 star ,7 months ago,Very disappointing. The food was ok but the whole place is very fake. We have had a very unwelcoming experience. The team is unprofessional and even rude. At the end of our very expensive dîner we asked for an invoice with taxes amount and …
28,Izakaya, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This particular restaurant is at a central point in Amsterdam. the food is excellent as well as the service by the employees. food prices are relatively high but they really deserve special sushi is just fine.
29,Izakaya, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great restaurant for a special night out. Its expensive of course but worth it. I believe they can improve their desserts! …

31,Izakaya, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A fantastic restaurant with some of the best sushi I have ever had I would have no hesitation to recommend this place to anybody absolutely fantastic
32,Izakaya, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ambiance is ok but food quality compared to the price is not worth it. You can definitely get better food for the same (or below) price. Food presentation is basic AF. 250€ for nothing.
33,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Innovative Peruvian/ Japanese cuisine. Great cocktails and sublime food.
34,Izakaya, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Was expecting street food style. Ended up being a bougie style. We had the Omakse and was BLOWN AWAY! Seven courses. Worth every penny!! The presentation, the food quality, our waiter. Everything succeeded our expectations."
35,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best...Asian...restaurant...ever! All the food is great,tasty, exquisite and delicious. Everytime I come to Amsterdam I don't miss Izakaya. Great selection of wines as well."
36,Izakaya, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A true hotspot of Amsterdam. Heard some great stories about this restaurant and they lived up to every expectation! The waiter helped us choose the best dishes in combination with lovely wines. This is a true dinner experience if you are looking for something special. Best sushi I've had in a long time, we will come back for sure!"
37,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Elegant yet expensive, crowded and distinguished. Would recommend it if you are not looking for a candlelight dinner."
38,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful service and delicious food! Tapas style so portions vary. The waiters took time to make sure we were seated comfortably, explained the menu to us and made recommendations. Would definitely love to come back!"
39,Izakaya, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Solid Asian food restaurant in Amsterdam. Tasteful fish and good courses. Wine list is quite limited.
40,Izakaya, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The desserts at this restaurant are marvellous. A must stop on every visit to Amsterdam. A special mention to the pastry chef Lamisah, Hands of magic :D"
41,Izakaya, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice ambience and great food!
42,Izakaya, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The food is good and the service friendly, but it's not right price-quality wise, way too expensive for what it is. The restaurant seems to be short on waiters so it takes ages to place an order; sadly the buzz girls are not allowed to take …"
43,Izakaya, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food! If they don't have a table get seats at the bar; doesn't make the food any worse! Try the Tempura Corn for sure!
44,Izakaya, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Nothing short of AMAZING. The food here, every single dish, is just brilliant. In the like 30 times ive eaten here the experience is consitently awesome. With dito waitering."
45,Izakaya, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The service was friendly and the staff knowledgeable and sweet.
However, it was extremely fast service and we were in and out within 1.15hrs, spending 200€. …"
46,Izakaya, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, but in terms of value for money a bit lacking. Also, the wine list is really nothing special but 8-10 euros a glass. Service is correct and friendly, they work with a shift system."
47,Izakaya, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Ambience good located in albert cuyp, so many choices for food options but i love is the one i tried the baby squid and the place is calm and cozy"
48,Izakaya, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Friendly cool place with excellent service, competent hands-on people and really good food:)!!"
49,Izakaya, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I have visited Izakaya twice already. On the second occasion, we made a booking at a specific time, and we knew we were going to be late around 30-45 minutes, so we tried to call the restaurant but no one answered. The restaurant cancelled …"
50,Izakaya, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Izakaya is an asian fusion restaurant mainly japanese but with some other inspiration. The location isn’t big but well set up. The food selection is well balanced and dishes are delicious. The staff is fine, nothing over the top. Music can …"
51,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Japanese / Peruvian flavors with loud music and open bar style eating. We walked into this restaurant and sat at the main bar without reservation. The rest of the seating appears to be bar style sharing a long wood table cut direct from a …
52,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Service is absolutely amazing. Manager Ralf is such a knowledgeable and kind host. His eye for detail is simply impeccable. Amazing dishes. We had such a wonderful time wining and dining at this pearl. Absolute ACE.
53,Izakaya, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The food, drinks and service are all excellent.  Definitely a little pricey but very much worth it once you experience it!  Great place for a special night out."
54,Izakaya, 1 star ,2 years ago,Easily the most overrated restaurant in all of Amsterdam—came here for a special evening with my wife. We ordered a mushroom dish that was so terrible that we sent it back. An eel dish that was chewy—not melt in your mouth tasty as well …
55,Izakaya, 2 stars ,a year ago,Picked up the sushi box for 49 euros. If you are a small eater and normally always order a starter as a main- sure! For me it did feel like just a starter. I expected a bit more for 49 euros. Overpriced.
56,Izakaya, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great cocktails; very nice fish; impeccable service and a great vibe. Izakaya is a great place both for dining with your partner and for bringing friends together. …
57,Izakaya, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fresh food, surprising tastes. The menu is long enough not to know what to order. We were indecisive so the waitress asked for main indications (seafood, meat) and consequently made us an amazing custom set menu. The dark atmosphere is enjoyable but the house music is way too loud, and not appropriate."
58,Izakaya, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Honestly, I expected a lot better than this. My gf and I booked in Saturday night for our anniversary dinner in Amsterdam South.
Cocktail served was watery, too sweet and not at all like a picante. Sent …"
59,Izakaya, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The best thing is the food!
Really outstanding!
The design seems to be so cool and unique so it is not comfortable and a little …"
60,Izakaya, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was delicious and beautifully presented, the service was very nice and attentive. The price is a bit on th high end and during our stay an employee started vacuuming the place which was a bit irritating. Worth a visit for sure!"
61,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing 7 course dinner - my boyfriend was celebrating his birthday, they made a special dessert for him and gave us 2 espresso martinis. I would recommend this restaurant if you love sushi"
62,Izakaya, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A top notch Asian restaurant.
Perfect service and very tasty menu.
The portions ate very small just like in any other otzi potzi restaurant. Some …"
63,Izakaya, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was okay. But nothin worth the money. Service was a bit slow. Anywhere in Ibiza where you pay the same prices bit beter with better service. And quality We don’t care about money, but if it’s just not worth it we would tell. Izakaya is just not it. Btw I have a big stomach ache after izakaya"
64,Izakaya, 2 stars ,6 years ago,Met here for dinner with a group friends on Friday. During dinner we were rushed to order as they wanted to free up the table at 9pmin in case they could sell the table for a second shift.Not exactly the setting for an evening with friends …
65,Izakaya, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Extremely expensive and very small portions. Quality is TOP. Staff very arrogant. You go hungry again from the restaurant but at least 100 € for a few sushi going on. Very loud music, so that you can hardly talk. No thanks."
66,Izakaya, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good buy overpriced! Without a doubt the quality of the whole service and food is good but it is not the 'best you hope for' when you pay this amount of money for your food and drinks. There are plenty restaurants in town with food and more knowledge about wat they serve you.
67,Izakaya, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was excellent, portions are small but with so many courses your end up leaving full. I found the menu a tad overpriced and the music  a bit too loud, but the restaurant fills a nice niche for “cool” “trendy” restaurant vibe."
68,Izakaya, 2 stars ,5 years ago,This place is terribly over rated. The menus just have random names of dishes but no descriptions of what is included in the dish. Our server took a really long time to get menu's to us so we asked her to send some **starter** food to our …
69,Izakaya, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really, really good food. Japanese and South American fusion is something any sushi lover has to try! A tad expensive, and the place can get quite loud later in the evening due to how popular it is. (Not necessarily a bad thing to be so …"
70,Izakaya, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Cocktails could be better and less expensive, or orgasmically delicious for this price. The design of the place could be much better designed. The inox or aluminium bar is not very cosy."
71,Izakaya, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food, great people. Beyond expectations. 👍"
72,Izakaya, 1 star ,4 years ago,"What a disappointment! We're used to fine sushis restaurants (NYC-London-Paris) either ""classical"" or ""fusion"". Izakaya's food is good but just slightly above the average sushis bar. The problem is the price (my son's menu: €99) and the …"
73,Izakaya, 1 star ,5 years ago,"After two visits before, this time the service was very bad. We understand Izakaya operates in shifts. After 45 minutes waiting in the hotel lounge we got the table at 21.45. It took some time before we got the first food. After two rounds, …"
74,Izakaya, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Over rated restaurant. We had an ok starter - fried rice with tuna tartar.
Main dishes beef tabon was nice a bit too small to the opinion of my companions. …"
75,Izakaya, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, fusion between Japanese and South American fare with the accent on the Asian taste. Quite pricey though. Several review sites, incl google, tell you they have a handicapped restroom but I unfortunately had to find out that they …"
76,Izakaya, 1 star ,2 years ago,We got a reserveration today and got heavily discriminated and not taken serious as a customer. When I came back from the badroom the blond waiter girl asked me to put my cap off due to a dress code. I nocked and walked back to the table to …

78,Izakaya, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"been there before. had a better experience. was still amazing
had a horrible table (next to the kitchen....) it was ok for us, cause the music was a bit loud, and there we could talk. …"
79,Izakaya, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Great food, the down side is the high price. The chillian sea bass is amazing. There was only one Prosecco option, which was ashame, but they have a good champagne selection. Trendy place and clientele. I will revisit."
80,Izakaya, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice place for brunch or dinner. Very good and tasty food and cocktails!

It's a bit pricey, but definitely a good decision you want to do a little splurge."
81,Izakaya, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Today we went to izakaya for dinner and we were served by a young man named michael, the service was 10/10, he really should get a salary raise, he helped us with making a choice for the food, he explained every detail and the food he recommended was more than delicious, we loved our dinner thanks to michael! 🤍"
82,Izakaya, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The cocktails here are expensive, small, and not all that tasty. The music has a continuous beat as if you are at a house party. If you are not dressed in black and above forty, you don’t fit in. Cannot judge the food but it was looking good."
83,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super expensive but the food and cocktails were amazing. A beautiful bar. Attentive service. Must order backed oyster!
84,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food and super nice staff! The flavors are so fresh and the quality of the courses is really honorable. Great restaurant 👍
85,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Was amanzing place for have a dinner, me and my girdfriend booking in izakaya in our last night in Amterdam, and we realy apreciate the service of the crew and the floor manager was  realy near off us, totality recomendate. Thansk for the experience!"
86,Izakaya, 2 stars ,2 years ago,They position themselves as a luxurious exclusive place but this is not so. Just show off. Food was very usual for restaurant with michelen prices. I expected more but I liked absolutely nothing
87,Izakaya, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Chic , hip and excellent Japanese inspired kitchen . Connected to a hotel the people behind the scenes know how to serve and set standards .
Service and quality always on a high level . Pricy but worth every cent .
Good cocktail List and happening bar ."
88,Izakaya, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Too much salt in almost all dishes we ordered. For the money you pay the food is absolutely nothing special, and I would say any quite average Japanese place in a small alley around a courner could win blind tastings against this place. It …"
89,Izakaya, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice place, you can taste flavour of many part of the glove with excellent preparation, mix Asian and Latin American essence in a trendy spot, Wagyu beef it's delightful also the Wagyu and Foie Gras gyosas can be a good way to start."
90,Izakaya, 1 star ,3 years ago,"A beer, 6 slices of sashimi and 2 shrimps, €44! What a rip off. It's not an Izakaya restaurant at all - maybe 2 things on the menu count as Izakaya. Maybe bring a date here for a beer but don't waste your money on the food"
91,Izakaya, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I went here a while back, and everything was way overpriced. And why would you call your restaurant IZAKAYA in all caps, when what you offer is exactly the opposite of the izakaya experience? I really don't get this, as if the owner is just …"
92,Izakaya, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I was here a few weeks ago. The atmosphere is all right, but without any particular character. Food is mediocre at best and spectacularly overpriced. Mad props for the fantastic dj, though."
93,Izakaya, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Definitely to expensive for what you get. Food is average and much better at other international places like zuma or nobu. Interior design is zero. Service is good. Worst thing is the music. Way to loud and not good selected.
94,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great vibe and good food. Our server, Charissa was extremely helpful. Highly recommend if Asian fusion is what you like."
95,Izakaya, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Decend cocktail, but very rude hostess. I do expect little bit more service. If i ask a simple question for the bill, i just got short answer ask my other colleague."
96,Izakaya, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wow   man

My host was Giulia and she was super skilful and she made great cocktail for me. …"
97,Izakaya, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food and drinks... Wow! I recommend it a lot! 😏
98,Izakaya, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Service was very good and friendly.
Went there with high expectations looking for real Japanese food; it was a big disappointment being served non Japanese rice (probably that day the preparation was not good only? Rice was mushi and felt low quality)"
99,Izakaya, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Hectic atmosphere, weird seating arrangement, slow service and small & overpriced dishes. Not worth the effort, unless one wants to impress and appear to be hip."
100,Izakaya, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Happy to be here, good food and drinks. Wonderful experience."
101,Izakaya, 5 stars ,7 years ago,As a foodie I love good food. I think Izakaya is the best Japanese restaurant in Amsterdam. Spicy tuna is divine here. And make sure to try the gyoza. Good cocktails too!
102,Izakaya, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Balanced to perfection. Can get busy on special ocassions but they sure know how to deliver top quality food and service. A must visit for anyone in the area.

112,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice vibe at the resto.. service was top class.. the food was prepared with loads of delicacy.. a must visit in Amsterdam.
113,Izakaya, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I was there for lunch and had the salmon bento box. It was very overpriced at 25 EUR for what you get, and not very inventive at all. Whilst the quality was ok, it lacked flavour."
114,Izakaya, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Food is descent. But, this place is trying so hard to be as if it is in Milan, NYC or London. A bunch of wannabes! Waiting to get a table and bunch girls just blow past me .....thinking they were models to go ask for a table."
115,Izakaya, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hi end food for the foodies! Delicious in every aspect, service, taste and presentation! Highly recommended!!"
