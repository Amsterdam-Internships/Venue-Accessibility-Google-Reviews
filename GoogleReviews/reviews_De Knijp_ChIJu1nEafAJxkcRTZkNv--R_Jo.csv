0,De Knijp, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I go along with some of my rather critically guide-fellows: it is not a bad restaurant yet it is not a special one neither. The menu offers some standards, the day‚Äôs special seems to be a bit more on the fresh side. Nevertheless it was not ‚Ä¶"
1,De Knijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My recomendation is absolute.
De Knijp is a nice folksy oldish place with a relaxed atmosphere. I was there late a Thursday after a concert. Very short walk from Concertgebouw. Had a Lamb ‚Ä¶"
2,De Knijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Updated review: 5 stars. The food was even better than what I remembered and the music was nice. I know we can rely on De Knijp for great food when most restaurants are already closed. ‚Ä¶
3,De Knijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The lamp shank is unbelievable, so tendered, so flavored. Even the white wine is great. Good atmosphere, too. One of the best experience in Amsterdam."
4,De Knijp, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Rolled the dice and picked this place at random, and I  was not disappoint.
The service was very friendly and *fast*.
The lamb tenderloin was tasty and tender. ‚Ä¶"
5,De Knijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wile had had sate pork and spaghetti with shrimps. Food was perfect in taste and perfectly cooked. Seasonal beer from Belgium was also perfect and very friendly staff.
6,De Knijp, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Really exciting when I come here.
Always eaten well, a guarantee even if with high prices for my standard I would choose it anyway!"
7,De Knijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing! Best meal my husband and I have ever had, and we go out for dinner...a lot! The beef tenderloin was cooked to perfection, as were the scallops, pork, everything was delicious. Our compliments to the chef. Great service, cozy ambiance, we'll definitely be back."
8,De Knijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We went there before a concert in The Concertgebouw and it was perfect. We had little time to eat and they were very fast to ensure we did not miss the beginning of the act. We ordered a steak and a burger and they were both excellent. The ‚Ä¶
9,De Knijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely food. Staff very nice. We arrived late (thanks a lot, Easyjet!) but it was my wife's birthday. Restaurant rose to the occasion with fireworks (!). Great scallops as starter and and lobster with frites as main course."
10,De Knijp, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Restaurants with a 4.3 average rating on google.maps are usually far better than this one. We had fish and steak; both was served on tasteless, saltless sauteed vegetables. Fish and steak tasted average; any steakhouse can do this better. ‚Ä¶"
11,De Knijp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, excellent service, cozy atmosphere & good prices üëçüèº"
12,De Knijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was average. Nothing wrong with it, nothing special. On par with the price. The table where we sat was a bit cramped. The interior is cozy, nice terrace but a slight fish fragrance inside. ‚Ä¶"
13,De Knijp, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Decent meal with good service. On a main street so easy to find.
14,De Knijp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice Dutch/French mix of food, good quality, tasty dishes! The lamb shank was really juicy and delicious! The desserts choice was interesting and the one we took as as good as it sounded!"
15,De Knijp, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice restaurant, good steaks and hearty Dutch food. Not much modern edge to the menu/food, but most Dutch restaurants seem guilty of that - made up for with everything having been cooked perfectly (steak, salmon, etc). Don't let a quiet ‚Ä¶"
16,De Knijp, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"How the hell did this place get 4 out of 5?! Sure, the restaurant is atmospheric, the service is very average, but the food definitely wasn't as glorious as the other reviews made it out to be. I ordered the grilled chicken - which comes ‚Ä¶"
17,De Knijp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We had a great dinner in De Knijp. We really liked the atmosphere, it was very cozy. The service was great too. I had a tenderloin and my sister had duck - both were very good, we can just recommend it."
18,De Knijp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great service, amazing food and atmosphere. Ordered the grilled scallops with seaweed salad and it was cooked to perfection! Came here on Kings day as all the other restaurants around the area were all closed. Thank goodness we spotted this gem!"
19,De Knijp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful small bistro with great food and booze. Value. Best chicken soup I have had since childhood. Full of flavour. Chef knows his stuff.
20,De Knijp, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"We have been dining here for over 28 years and visit everytime we are in Amsterdam, which is at least 2-3 times a year.  The food has always been amazing.  I can highly reccommend the satay, seabass and teriyaki salmon.  The staff are very friendly and attentive.  You won't be disappointed."
21,De Knijp, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely dutch pub that serves dinner until midnight. Steak and burger were excellent. Service was standard for amsterdam. Definitely recommended if you're looking for a cozy spot near the rijksmuseum.
22,De Knijp, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was mediocre, review average of this restaurant for sure didnt make sense to me.
Waiters were friendly but constantly dropping utensils and talking inappropriate ‚Ä¶"
23,De Knijp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,After flying into Amsterdam late into the evening the first and only stop before the hotel was De Knijp.  Pieter waited on us and took the best of care. His sense of humor was great! Almost as great as the food.  We ordered the grilled ‚Ä¶
24,De Knijp, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Ambience o.k., food regular, but not spectacular, service unprofessional and robotic. Unless Piet is there, who is the best. If he's not there you're in the hands of several blond girls with ponytails who have no idea."
25,De Knijp, 5 stars ,9 years ago,My husband and I ate here this evening and had a wonderful experience.  Service was the friendliest and most helpful of our entire week in the Netherlands.  Food was equally wonderful. Would recommend to anyone visiting the area!
