25,Labyrinth Cocktail, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best cocktails of Amsterdam and the only place in the city that serves them for a relatively modest price. The food (Caribbean/West-African) is just jummy, we rarely over eat but we had to keep ordering more. It's not a super chic cocktail ‚Ä¶"
26,Labyrinth Cocktail, 5 stars ,a year ago,Really unique spot with great soul food and cocktails to go along with it.
