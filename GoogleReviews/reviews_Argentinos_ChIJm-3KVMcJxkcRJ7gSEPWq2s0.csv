1,Argentinos, 4 stars ,4 months ago,After a lovely long day of walking and strolling in Amsterdam we chose this place out of thousands and did not regret it. Nice staff and owner
2,Argentinos, 4 stars ,a week ago,"Nice restaurant, good options specially steak was amazing."
3,Argentinos, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Unfriendly staff,rude behaviour,always in hurry to send the guest away..even though the restaurant is not that busy.
They really should teach the waiter some manners.. ‚Ä¶"
4,Argentinos, 1 star ,5 months ago,"The meat is tough, the desserts are not worth it and the staff leaves something to be desired. The price doesn't help either. They use the ""Argentinian"" concept as a tourist attraction, but then it leaves a lot to be desired :("
5,Argentinos, 1 star ,6 months ago,"good evening
I would like to inform the restaurant authorities about a bad situation I encountered while visiting your restaurant. One of your waitresses treated me and my ‚Ä¶"
6,Argentinos, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The food is good and satisfactory for the price. The staff is very friendly and proactive. They have some nice steak options and the staff will help you to chose the best one for you. The ambience is very nice even though it's comparatively smaller in size.
7,Argentinos, 1 star ,3 months ago,Food is good . But the workers attitude is disaster. All of them are so rude and disrespect.
8,Argentinos, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"We have been there already two times, and both visits were good. Friendly staff and good food."
9,Argentinos, 5 stars ,a year ago,Came to Amsterdam for 2 nights. Ate here on the first night and it was so good we came back the next night too. Very unlike me to do that but the food was SO GOOD and the service was exceptional. VERY highly recommended.

13,Argentinos, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Great steak in the centre of the city, would highly recommend"
14,Argentinos, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The food was extremely well prepared, the steak cooked to perfection in my opinion.

15,Argentinos, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place to stop when you need something a little more substantial in the red light district. The lamb was superb and balanced well with salad, veggie and a potato. Finish dinner with an exquisite cappuccino for a perfect meal."

27,Argentinos, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The waiters were very rude to us and made jokes because we ordered chicken, like ‚ÄúOh, 2 times chicken.. what a surprise!‚Äù That immediately ruined the whole experience. To top it all off, they gave us the check that was waaay more expensive ‚Ä¶"
28,Argentinos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best steaks in Amsterdam! I first tried this restaurant around 10 years ago on my first trip to Amsterdam and it blew me away and continues to do so 10 years later. I have been to the city 5 times and this is always on my list of ‚Ä¶

37,Argentinos, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"With the exception of the location, there's not really anything unique about this restaurant. Portions of food aren't too great for the prices. The sauces were all leaking which certainly made things messy and even when the waiter spilled ‚Ä¶"
38,Argentinos, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The place doesn't worth the money. Prices are sky high and the service is the worst I seen in my experience. The food was on average level.

40,Argentinos, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great steak and wine!
Wanted a steak and a bottle of wine... and found it! The steak was great - asked for rare and came rare (rather than medium as some places serve). Good flavour and the Malbec Reserve was spot on. Friendly staff too."
41,Argentinos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food, great service and beautiful atmosphere. We loved every minute in this place and we had so much fun with the background music going on and all. Lovely place to be dining in, totally worth the money."
42,Argentinos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice Argentinian restaurant with very good food. Service was a little eager taking plates away (asking when some of us were still eating) but that may have been to do with the approaching closing time. Would definitely recommend.
43,Argentinos, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food, good company and great drinks left this reviewer a happy customer. I will be coming back in the future. Highly recommended, especially for travellers who haven't been to the country."
44,Argentinos, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Steaks were good. Chips look like they were from a frozen packet. Charged extra for sides and sauce. Very amateur service with 6 staff hovering over the table. Clearing plates while other people still eating at the table. As soon as the ‚Ä¶
45,Argentinos, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I do give bad reviews very seldomly, but Argentinos was the worst restaurant I ate in during my 5 night stay. For the given prices,, the quality and presentation of the food is not acceptable. I would give this restaurant just one star, but ‚Ä¶"
46,Argentinos, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"OK but not exceptional. T bone not so tasty, chimichuri sauce not tasty at all (only oil...). Push to sell and try to shift tables as quick as possible, there are much better places around."
47,Argentinos, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ordered one burger and 2 combo meals. Burger was a hunk of meat in 2 pieces of bread. No seasoning, no lettuce or onion, no sauce.
The combo meals were raw despite asking for well done. The meat had no seasoning whatsoever. Furthermore, it spoiled our stomachs. Pathetic."
48,Argentinos, 1 star ,6 years ago,"AVOID THIS PLACE! They will mislead and take your money!

50,Argentinos, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Waiter was not overly polite to begin with (think due to not being a local, I travel a lot and can tell). Food was not very good either. Poor quality food and overpriced for what you receive. The d√©cor was best part about the place."
51,Argentinos, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Do Not go here!! BEWARE of their so-called $15 ""special"". They charged an additional $7,50 Euro for bread!!!! and ,50 Euro for butter. Food was average at best. Wait staff was awful and manager (maybe owner was utterly insulting when I asked for the bread charge to be removed- he refused). BAD EXPERIENCE."
