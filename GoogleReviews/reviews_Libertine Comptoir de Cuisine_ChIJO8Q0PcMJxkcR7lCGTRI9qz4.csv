0,Libertine Comptoir de Cuisine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best ""Salad Nicoise"" presentations. Love the freshly - and perfectly - poached egg instead of one that's hard boiled!
This beautiful new-ish breakfast and lunch place has euper sweet staff, terrific tunes, lots o'light, and the espresso ain't bad either!"
1,Libertine Comptoir de Cuisine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of my favourite place for coffee and breakfast. Their french toast is served with mascarpone and is very tasty. Itâ€™s a cool and trendy place. Waitress is always kind and sociable.
2,Libertine Comptoir de Cuisine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to eat, not always good to find, but it has an authentic and rough decoration once inside. A nice cafe with a good menu. Help is quick and the food is f good quality and very tastefully. It is known for its sandwiches with sirups. But we tried some meat sandwiches and were very happy!"

4,Libertine Comptoir de Cuisine, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Took 44 minutes to make toast, steak tartare and a poached egg. Portion size is quite small and several people were served before us even though they ordered after us. â€¦"
5,Libertine Comptoir de Cuisine, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Klein maar fijn. The food we had was tasty. the service poor. The juice served in a mini glas :( when eating there was somebody loudly sneezing at the bar :((
6,Libertine Comptoir de Cuisine, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good service and breakfast, I recommend the eggs benedict! Unfortunately the presentation of the food was not very nice, but maybe some people like this.."
7,Libertine Comptoir de Cuisine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I loved the two French toasts (one sweet and the other one saviury) ive chosen.
8,Libertine Comptoir de Cuisine, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food was good unfortunately felt like it was severely overpriced for me. Had the French toast with fruit and paid 6 euros for one slice of bread. Orange juice was freshly squeezed which I loved but 5 euros for a small glass of it.
9,Libertine Comptoir de Cuisine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best coffee in Amsterdam.
I had the salmon and horseradish toast, absolutely delicious. The sides in the lunch menu are very generous portions. Staff is very attentive and pleasant."
10,Libertine Comptoir de Cuisine, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food & coffee! But the french toast was a bit overpriced... you only get one slice of bread which I think is not much for 6/7 euros.

12,Libertine Comptoir de Cuisine, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good food, nice staff! But the portions are on the small side... When you're really hungry one little toast is not going to fix it for you haha"
13,Libertine Comptoir de Cuisine, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Horrible service! I had to go myself to take the menus after waiting for quite some time. Afterwards I had to go back to tell the waitress, which was busy texting, to please take our order. I never got my food and after long time I had to â€¦"
