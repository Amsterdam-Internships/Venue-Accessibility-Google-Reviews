0,Green House Munchies, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Brilliant Breakfast. Popped into this place for breakfast before we had to drive home, the whole place was clean, the food was excellent, the service was quick, trendy decor and style. I really enjoyed it."
1,Green House Munchies, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Chilling at the bar enjoying a huge chicken caesar salad. Well done! will be back for breakfast.
2,Green House Munchies, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Been here before but I am on a short layover and came into the city to eat here! Delicious as always!
3,Green House Munchies, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was good and filling. The waitresses were nice, but did not check in on us often, resulting in empty glasses. Also took away the plate from my table companion while I was still eating. Good music and nice interior."
4,Green House Munchies, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best burger place I have ever been to in the heart of one of the most beautiful cities to ever be. The recipes are very creative and all the products taste good they are all fresh, plus the steaks are all black angus (very high quality meat)"
5,Green House Munchies, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Chicken burger didn't have enough seasoning. Whiskey price reasonable but some other beverages a bit overpriced. Price/value ratio could be better overall, but they served water and extra bread without charging and offered great service ‚Ä¶"
6,Green House Munchies, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Awesome burgers and milkshakes. More on the menu if you want all with good prices. ‚Ä¶
7,Green House Munchies, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Went to Amsterdam for 3 days and ate here every morning.  Not a large menu bit what they do they do fantastically. Me and my group all loved what we ordered and never had any complaints. Staff are really friendly.

9,Green House Munchies, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Went there today and ordered a salad with no dressing as i'm allergic to Gluten. The salad comes with some bread on top, so i politely explained that i couldn't eat it and would get very sick if i did. I said i was happy to pay for another ‚Ä¶"
10,Green House Munchies, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wonderful restaurant if I go back to Amsterdam I would definitely go back. The waitress speaks English and Spanish which was great. The steak and the potatoes were good, for drinks I order a mojito and was the Best. For Dessert a creme brul√©. They have a variety selection for food, drinks and desserts. I highly recommend it"
11,Green House Munchies, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Been there for lunch. It was a nice little cosy place. Location is fanstasic. Most of the customers there are tourists. Staff were good.we ordered a falafel burger. It didnt look like falafel balls and on top of it was horribly oily. Bun, ‚Ä¶"
12,Green House Munchies, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Killer atmosphere. The goat cheese and fig salad was delicious, along with the salmon starter! When ordering a Bloody Mary, however, the waitress simply served a glass of tomato juice and vodka with the sauces on the side (Tabasco and Worcestershire) instead of mixing it in for us beforehand. That was strange."

16,Green House Munchies, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The food is delicious, but the staff in the (open) kitchen is very loud. When I asked if they could be quite I heard the chef say that I should go to a one star Michelin restaurant if I had a problem with their singing. Very rude and impolite."
17,Green House Munchies, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I usually go for dinner, which is always very good however went for a morning coffee and was sold the absolute worst muffin I have ever seen, or eaten, I then asked for a pastry and also can tell the items were from the freezer. I tried ‚Ä¶"
