18,Stones Cafe, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The place has a separated bar and night club. The issue is that the bar feels a lot more like a nightclub than the actual nightclub part. It's quite pricey and very crowded at night. I didn't stay for more than one drink and have no ‚Ä¶

20,Stones Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great spot, doorman was friendly and the staff were too. Pints of Heineken were great and were typical price as other places nearby. They allow you to smoke inside as well which was great and the tunes were good. Overall great atmosphere"
21,Stones Cafe, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place for people who are more than stoned. To loud music, I coudnt even hear my minds don't want to mention about talking.

35,Stones Cafe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best bar in Amsterdam, if you want to have a good time go there with or without your friends, the music is fine for any taste, the place is pretty great so you won't be disturbed by the lack of space there like in the streets of the city or some others bar. Definitely recommanded."
36,Stones Cafe, 1 star ,2 years ago,New bartender throws beer out when you are looking the other way. Then starts yelling at you when say smt about it. Hospitality level is below 1*. Shame as the bar is a nice place.
