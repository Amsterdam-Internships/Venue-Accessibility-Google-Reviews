1,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,2 months ago,My daughter wanted to get a kbbq for dinner and we've decided to come to Star BBQ. We're afraid that we'll have to wait for a long line because it's NYE. To our surprise we're seated after 20 minutes. Our meat order came pretty quick and …

Service was VERY good, shocking how much meat they offered us at a time (and …"
3,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"They have beef tongue! Most Korean BBQ don’t have beef tongue now, I wonder why? Definitely better than Gen Korean BBQ. $8 for beer, but you get the second one for 1 penny, definitely keeps me coming because of that too! The spicy tofu soup is good too."

10,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is good here, so is the service. The service was super fast and we were able to sit down fast. This place has changed over the years, but the price has gone up. A real good place for a good experience, but I couldn't afford coming …"
11,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,First time there for a birthday and I actually enjoyed it.  Great service! I liked the fact that they gave us a big portion of their condiments so you don't really have to sit and wait everytime.

17,Star BBQ, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I know the place was getting busy but why did I have to ask my waiter 3 times of he can grab me a Pepsi?  AND WHY DIDN'T HE BRING ME MY RICE?!!  I felt neglected.  Where's the service?   However, I have to say the ice cream was aiite. 😒"
18,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Star BBQ has been and still is my favorite KBBQ spot in Orange County. They are at 50% capacity right now, which helps with social distancing. Masks are mandatory, temperature scans are taken upon entry and hand sanitizer is readily …"
19,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Quality meat!! And our waiter was on point, besides the waiting to get our table we didn't have to wait at all in between rounds. My favs are bottom sirloin and plain pork belly. They're delicious!
p/s Ice cream will be offered again on 6/15."
20,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Coming right when it opens you get the most fastest and quick service. A little disappointed the tofu soup was cold.

26,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great place and good price. Better than Gen and cheaper too. Just get on the wait list before heading here cause wait times are long.

30,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,a year ago,The food was really good. Lots of options. The drinks were great as well. Understandably there are covid restrictions which is fine. You and your party have 90mins to compete your meal. It's worth it. 😊

The unlimited meats are delicious.
Service is always great. …"
38,Star BBQ, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Star BBQ is a decent Korean All You Can Eat location. It has the standard and small list of beef, pork, chicken, and other choices. I'm mostly concerned with beef, so the choices were small. The staff is great. The meat quality is ok. There …"

42,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food and great service! Cant wait until next time!
43,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great time. Waits are long so prepare accordingly but once you're in you'll be pounding meat like it's pre-covid times. Most tables are sectioned off and spaced apart. Staff always had masks on and kept reasonable distance. Will dine again!!

45,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my all time favorite kbbq's. Love it so much, friends and I drive from LA to eat here. Service is really friendly. If you're here when they're not busy, you'll have like 4 people assisting you with all your requests. …"

48,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Authentic Korean food and boy do they keep the meat plentiful! They filled us up on quality meat and seafood instead of small portion and too many sides. Fabulous servers and buy a beer get a beer for .01 was amazing! Def worth a try
49,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The food here is awesome. Super cool way to dine and the quality of food is top notch. I discovered some things I never thought I'd actually like too. Customer service wasn't horrible but it wasn't exactly great either. Our waiter seemed to get annoyed easily and didn't seem to speak much English. Overall I'd come here again though
50,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I absolutely love this place.  Servers were very polite and attentive. They're very busy during dinnertime and there is a waiting place but there is a cozy bar upstairs. The food was very excellent me and my family enjoyed it.
51,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,a week ago,Delicious food and great service!
52,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good meats, tasty and good quality. Service is decent, those servers are pretty worn out with all those smokes so they looked a bit tired and wasn't attentive, i wouldn't blame them for that. After an 1hr and a half eating in there, i feel tired too."
53,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best service and food around the area in my opinion. You could go to the Red Castle which is right next to them and save half the money but then you would end up with no service at all. …
54,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food here is good, but the wait is long.  You can have drinks at the bar while waiting which is nice.  I love the steamed egg and soon tofu options.  The soft serve ice cream is tart but good.  I think this location is a tad bit pricey."
55,Star BBQ, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Been coming here many times, and it gets more low quality every time. The food is ok, but the service is not. The moment we sat down it took forever to find someone to order, and when we finally did, the server would just walk away when I'm …"
56,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I've heard good review about this place for years, but finally had the chance to visit today. …"
57,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was great! Server were very fast and friendly. The food was good. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was the limit restriction for two items off the premium.  I mean it's an AYCE place, why be stingy over it?"
58,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good place for all you can eat BBQ. Meat is pretty good quality. Side dishes are plentiful. Service can be better but you can call out whenever you need something. There are two options available:$18.99 & $22.99 depending on the meat …
59,Star BBQ, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Grill here is interesting it's a big what seems like cast iron plate and they scrape it to clean it. They offer free caramel soft serve with meals. Arguably it's among the dirtier Korean BBQs I've gone to but it does have its unique points.
60,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This place is my first choice restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I prefere it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to that place. when  I I need a fair supper, this is the place that comes first to my head. splendid and all kinds of …"
61,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Best place to go with a big group. One thing that sucks is that they recently started making everyone in each table has to get the same menu. Also if you have a big group they try to cram as many people in one table regardless of the …
62,Star BBQ, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Came an hour before closing and they were out of alot basic items. The food was ok, not amazing. The sides offered were lackluster. The staff was ok untill someone brought the bill while we were still eating and kept asking if we were ready …"
63,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Delicious Kbbq. Love the beef belly!
64,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Service is always nice here, even though my party kept hitting the call button and were pretty annoying honestly. Meat was good as always and the servers come within seconds of the button being clicked. The ice cream machine is also amazing :)"
65,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Sometimes the experience trumps the food. Tonight we had an AMAZING server named MAX!!! The sweetest, most attentive, kind server ever!!!!!! I was so impressed with his service, this kid needs a raise! I will be back based on the amazing …"
66,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Most flexible KBBQ I've been to. Meaning that they seated our group right away even though we arrived at different times. We ordered multiple times and the staff was great at taking the orders and bringing the food quickly.
67,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Meat is good and servers are attentive. Go when they open so theres no wait. Usually around 630/7pm the wait starts to be 2 hours. They have an upstair bar to hangout while you wait and pass the time.
68,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"two days ago was our first time we visited this magnificent restaurant. But It is absolutely not the last. We enjoyed the evening very much with the efficient service, with the excellent  cuisine and fine drinks and with the honest charge. We will surely come back soon."
69,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Unlimited beef with a very attentive staffs. Love the fried rice, we keep some short ribs and beef belly to mix in with the fried rice and is a game changer. Word of advice, if you don't know how to cook the meat then ask the server. Not all meats will cook the same."
70,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place was fairly priced and had good quality meat. There are places around that charge $50+ bucks for KBBQ but this place was under $30 and I left stuffed a d satisfied! They took a group of 10 pretty fast but maybe we just got lucky because this place was busy. Will definitely come here again
71,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Hands down the best Korean food/bbq we've had since living in LA for 20 years. Great quality and flavor of every kind of meat, great sides including tofu soup and fried rice, and great service as well, very rare in a Korean restaurant! Love everything :)"
72,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic meats!  Good beers and cheap prices.
73,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantatastic food! All the meat is high quality and the hot tofu soup is delicious. They are open late, but be prepared to wait. Once you are eating, you will be glad you did. Make sure to grab some soft serve on the way out."
74,Star BBQ, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The portions are generous, but it just doesn't taste that great. Marinated meats are pretty bland and unimpressive. Service is quick and polite, but the hostess didn't acknowledge us and we had to ask to be seated."
75,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I was pleasantly surprised at the service I received while visiting. It does take a lot to keep a business like this afloat and while making customer service your top priority, some may see this as challenging. I would definitely return as …"
76,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had an amazing experience in this spot. We loved the extraordinary vibes and the meals. The waiters are super amiable. I’m happy we finally managed to try this place.
77,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food ,large options for all you can eat meats. Great prices, they offer a buy one soju get the second for a penny so you cant beat that!! Staff is very friendly and helpful. This place gets busy so there may be a wait but its absolutely worth it! Try the steamed egg!!"
78,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was great, though a little pricey. The staff was quick to bring all the food. Sometimes they brought more than we ordered, but it was probably due to all the fan/music in the background. It's a nice place to bring friends and just have a good time."
79,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good variety of meat and everything is good quality. The bar at the top and self serve ice cream machine are also nice touches. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was more of a personal gripe, but the place has a really loud ambiance …"
80,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Cheaper than its competition with good quality meats and sides. I really enjoy their tofu soup because it's not too salty. Free froyo at the entrance is a nice treat. flavors will vary.
81,Star BBQ, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Went with some friends this weekend.

The waiting area is SUPER nice on the second floor like a lounge. …"
82,Star BBQ, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Star BBQ huh? Well they should have called it 2 Star BBQ because that's how many I felt it deserved. I left feeling hungrier than I had began. Now, Korean ""cook it yourself"" BBQ joints are hard to pull off, and this shows. The only …"
83,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,My go to spot for my korean bbq fix. Great quality meat for the price you pay. I usually dont have to wait very long to get seated which is a plus. Sometimes the upstairs bar is open so you can have a drink while you wait for a seat on busy nights.
84,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Amazing service and food.  Will be back!
85,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great quality, side dishes, and varieties of meat for $17.99. Parking lot is huge and location is great for parties or just a date for 2. There are TVs and a lot of things playing in the background but it's not loud enough to interrupt your conversations. Better than GEN KBBQ."
86,Star BBQ, 1 star ,5 years ago,It was OK... Nothing wow about it. Expensive. The waitress over charged us and refused to acknowledge. Celebrated my niece birthday with a table of 9 but the waitress said we used all 10 plates therefore it's considered 10 ppls... We didn't want to argue with her as half had left. Not going back...
87,Star BBQ, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I'm a Lyft Driver and I Love Korean BBQ, I happened to be in the area and was looking up different Korean BBQ places when I came across this place. It had a really good reviews they said the quality of food was good for great reasonable …"
88,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I enjoyed the Korean BBQ. It is AYCE, the service was a little below what I am used to as often I would ask for additional kimchi plates and rice wrappers and it would take them a while to bring them. They kept the meat flowing pretty fast. …"
89,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,11 months ago,AMAZING KBBQ! I have been to almost every KBBQ in Orange County and Star is top of the list. Best price to qualify ratio around.
90,Star BBQ, 1 star ,2 years ago,The are advertised till 1 am but they are telling we cannot be seated at 12:10 bc there kitchen is closed. Huge inconvenience considerate I live 30 min away. They were being rude to everyone who walked in. The restrooms were gross. So …
91,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Have been here a few times now, seems like they have remodeled the place since the last time we were here. Looks bigger than before. …"
92,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I visited on a Saturday night, so the wait was almost an hour. The quality of the food and the prompt, friendly service made the wait worthwhile. If asked, I would say this is a good place to hang out for decent eats."
93,Star BBQ, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Let me first say that I am not a fan of these kinds of 'restaurants' which cater to the younger drinking crowd. It is what it is....if you mainly enjoy cooking meat and eating it with some minimal condiments and alcohol, then this should …"
94,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fun place to drink, you have your options with beer, wine, or liquor at good prices. Food is good with the combo A option, Beef tongue and the fried rice stood out the most. Friendly and respectful staff for sure, it made the visit enjoyable."
95,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love everytime we can come here. The cuts of meat is wonderful, the sides are tasty, and the staff are very responsive for how busy they always are. Coming with a group is highly recommended."
96,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Tonight was my first time at Star BBQ. Brendan made my friend and I’s night so enjoying that we are definitely coming back. He was always attentive to our needs while serving the needs of other tables. And, of course, the food is delicious. A must go!"
97,Star BBQ, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food. I have been here twice. Only thing it's hard to get the server's attention. But other than that, I would definitely go back hear when I'm in town"
98,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I would say they could improve the security on the exterior of property, just to make customers feel a bit safer walking to and from their cars. I was approached by 2 separate stinky homeless people begging for money just on the short walk to my parked vehicle."
99,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I love the rice paper and bugolgi, sometimes the ramen, service is good, i dont order sea food cuz I don't like to see the animal my food is, if you get shrimp it looks like the animal, just a heads up. Other than that love it. I come here alot with my boyfriend and they even have icecream."
100,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"I joined the dinner party towards the end of the dinner so I only get to try one type of meat.  But I would say that quality of the galbi already proves me four yelp stars.  The service and the ambiance were average.  It's always good time when you have good food, soju, along with good company."
101,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,For an all you can eat Korean Barbeque spot this place is pretty good. They have two all you could eat options: A and B. A is a little bit more but you get some more cooking options. B is their budget one and it has plenty to offer. B is my …
102,Star BBQ, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"If you have a large party, be prepared to wait. We had a reservation and seated us right away. The service is what you have to wait on. No hot tea, but they have hot water. Unusual! The place is clean."
103,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"First time going with friends who love this place. The food was excellent and the service was the best I've experienced in a long time. The servers were attentative, polite and funny. I definitely reccomend the Spicy Pork Belly and Bulgogi."
104,Star BBQ, 1 star ,7 months ago,How does this rise above other Korean BBQs scattered around Socal? It doesn't... flat...basic... and uninteresting.
105,Star BBQ, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"They need better ventilation. It gets too hot in there.
The grill get to oily, so you get this yucky felling after you finish."
106,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"The place is always packed, and rightfully so. if you get here early enough for dinner, you wont have to wait long. but if you do have a long wait, you can always head upstairs to the bar area for some free coffee or grab a couple drinks …"
107,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Just okay service and we were there after 10pm. They took the old doorbells away from the tables so It was hard to get our waiters attention. Overall the food was great.
108,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,They have corn cheese. The food is a hit or miss. They have icecream station. Use yelp wait list and they are only opened for dinner. There is no wait before 6:30 pm.
109,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food and service with free ice cream. Spacious flat-top BBQ stove with each table. Wait-time can be long depending on when you visit.
110,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Meat 🔥. Service is either really good or really slow. Not really a middle ground. Side dishes are good. You WILL leave smelling like smoky bbq. My FAV AYCE kbbq. No other place compares in the area! 🥩
111,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best korean bbq in the OC.  Prices and service are good.  Its very busy average wait time is 1 hour.  They have a gelato machine (java and carmel flavor) where you can eat all the free gelato to your heart's content
112,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,a year ago,Food is good and the tables are big except the flames never touches your food so you can't get that slightly charred taste.
113,Star BBQ, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Our group of 12 had a reservation for a Friday night dinner. Surprisingly, the table was already good to go by the time we arrived so no additional wait. Plenty of side dishes such as chap jae (glass noodles), kimchi, broccoli, potato …"
114,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"The Best All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) BBQ ..like ever!!! The reason for a 4-star.. Sure when it's super busy like it is everyday and night....the service is a 4-star.. Sure when it's super busy, the wait-time can be from 2-4 hours. But I still I …"
115,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The meat was of good quality, the servers were very attentive (we never actually had to ring our call button), and the sides were all fantastic.  The price was reasonable for four people, and we had a very good experience."
116,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The meats are very delicious and tender compared to other places. Great service, amazing cheese corn and outstanding deals on alcohol. Buy 1 get 2nd for 1 cent!"

118,Star BBQ, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"My review on Star KBBQ.

I went there late around 1145pm with a party of 10. Know that they close at 1 . …"
119,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place but the menu that has the few extra meat options is not really worth it. The basic menu is perfect and the beef brisket is amazing!
120,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Quality of the meat is good.  Services is excellent.
121,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food was great; the service was good; the place was clean and the fans were quiet. We had a great time. I'm coming back for sure.
122,Star BBQ, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"Atmosphere was nice however customer service was horrible. I was seated quickly however to get any kind of service it took easily 15 minutes for ONE thing.  Food was alright in comparison to other places near by. For the price, food, and service I probably will not be coming back."
123,Star BBQ, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I don't think this place is worth the money you pay for.  Uness you really can eat 10+ plates of meat by yourself..  the quality of the meat here aren't that great.  If you are not a big eater, try avoid this place and go to a nicer place that serves high quality meat"
124,Star BBQ, 3 stars ,8 months ago,They don't give you lot of side dishes like the other restaurant and the Meats are so so.
125,Star BBQ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,All you can eat. 😊 Great food. Great family time.
126,Star BBQ, 3 stars ,10 months ago,It was okay. Decent barbecue with good service. Very average.

130,Star BBQ, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Went with a group, and we asked to split up the bill between each of us. I ended up paying $45.00!!!"
131,Star BBQ, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"They have reduced the quality since last time we visited. No salad bowl by default, and you can only call 2 ribs per person, and only 3 kinds per call."
132,Star BBQ, 3 stars ,5 years ago,One of my favorite places for ayce bbq but last time we were there they served clams to my friend who was allergic after we specifically asked if there was any seafood in the soup.
133,Star BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It was good for the buffet. Service was quick. We were better off not doing any seafood.
