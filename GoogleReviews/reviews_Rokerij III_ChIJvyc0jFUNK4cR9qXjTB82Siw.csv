4,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,a month ago,Such a great meal! Great drinks. I had the chili relleno. My wife had the halibut.   The portions were sizable and everything was made to perfection. Our service was great and even their music set a fantastic atmosphere. I kinda want that playlist.

13,Rokerij III, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Always delicious food & drinks. Service was great. It gets plenty busy so parking can be difficult. To enjoy, go a little early during the day if you can. The basement bar opens about 3 & it was empty as you can see in the pic. Great ambiance."
14,Rokerij III, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Overall we had a good experience here. Sat at a nice table in the basement bar area. The food was good but wouldn't say exceptional. Make sure you ask for the specials as they have as many options on special as they do on the menu. I think ‚Ä¶

17,Rokerij III, 1 star ,2 months ago,"Service is beyond terrible, food is ok but its not worth the 3 digits bill that you are going to pay,  there's nothing special about this place besides the overpriced menu.. I don't recommend it"
18,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Been to the Rokerij many times and has never disappointed. Service is attentive and knowledgeable, the food is amazing and the best New Mexican food I have had in the Phoenix area. They use vintage steal plates which look very cool and also ‚Ä¶"

26,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I loved Rokerij! We had the New Mexico Enchiladas and the Grilled Pork Chop Porterhouse. The food was amazing! Excellent flavors and big portions. We both took home leftovers. I highly recommend Rokerij.
27,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,a year ago,Sat at the bar where you can watch the cooks work the grill and stove.  That is worth the visit.  Happy hour food and drinks are quite good.  Will go back again when in the area.  Staff friendly and helpful.
28,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Good food. Dark little date spot!
29,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The subterranean bar is exactly where you want to be on a hot summer night. The staff is amazing and the ambiance can‚Äôt be beat. The seating is very limited though so limit the size of your group or you may wait awhile for a seat.
30,Rokerij III, 4 stars ,4 years ago,My wife and I had a nice anniversary dinner last night. Our server Perry was great. And the Sea Bass and Steak were delicious! Very chill atmosphere.
31,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place for drinks after a long day at work or for a last drink to call it a night. The basement area was impressive- bartender was on point. Had a tasty old fashion and a new drink called the honey badger which was like a lemon drop but with whiskey. It was great and fun hangout spot for a date or quick drink.
32,Rokerij III, 2 stars ,5 months ago,The second star is for the food which is really good. BUT service is quite bad. We came in tired and ended up with an almost 3 hour dinner. Everything from getting a menu to a box took too long. With a $100 pp bill i expect much MUCH more. Won't bring folks by any more.
33,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favorite  restaurant  in all of Arizona!! We had bone in pork  chop, house salads, trio of blacked fish varieties each with a different  sauce! Cheese cake for bday dessert!! It is an adult establishment  as they are NOT child friendly"

39,Rokerij III, 1 star ,5 months ago,Food was mediocre but the reason for the 1 star is the service. Went in with a birthday reservation and waiter didn‚Äôt answer our questions regarding the menu so we basically had to guide ourselves. We also tried to ask a different server ‚Ä¶
40,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As always this place doesn't disappoint. The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable and timed everything right.

51,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I think it's Asian and Mexican fusion.  Don't really care what you call, it was great.  So good, went back for Sunday brunch.  Was hungover and by the time I left, I felt good enough to finish my whole day.  When I come back to Arizona, I will be sure to go out of my way and stop at Rokerij."

67,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. I love the food, and service has been consistently great every time. Last visit I had the enchiladas with beans and rice and they were just delicious. The drinks are great as well. Portions are generous, so be ready to eat!

71,Rokerij III, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was fantastic! Service was great, they really know their stuff. We had reserved the private room which was very nice. The main restaurant is quite lively and a bit loud (for old guys like me) which some will find adds to the festive mood. Good, if small, wine list, and prickly pear margaritas. Nice."
72,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Love the ambience down in the cellar of the Rokerij. This evening was no exception... The jalape√±o margarita was on point. The bacon wrapped jalape√±os divine. The ""hors d'oeuvre"" Rokerij burger delightful and large. I try something new every time and it never disappoints. Can't wait for next time."

76,Rokerij III, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Loud food plentiful but quite routine. Calamari ok  scnitzel fair but very bland. Prices quite high. No value here.

78,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was our first time there, and we had a table reserved in the basement.  The atmosphere was fantastic.

81,Rokerij III, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, great ambiance. Ambiance used to justify disparity between food quality and cost. Less and less so. Good but not amazing food shouldn't cost so much. Improve the quality, reduce the price, or both. ‚Ä¶"
82,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Rokerij is truly a gem of an establishment, and serves some of the best cocktails and wine at a stellar happy hour price. The bartenders are always fun, personable, and attentive. Their Rokerij burger isn't messing around and it'd be a ‚Ä¶"

87,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Been going there for years but had a table downstairs for the first time.  Total Rokerij ambiance with a more intimate twist.   Another first for me was the bone-in prime rib.  It was awesome. Possibly best in town!  The mark of an iconic restaurant is that it can offer new discoveries to long-time patrons.  It never gets old!

96,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely love the cellar bar and the staff there are incredibly helpful.  I highly recommend the fish trio for dinner and the oldest fashion cocktail when you're there. My husband found this place for me 2 years ago and I'm in love.
97,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Warm, intriguing atmosphere with amazing food and specials. Higher on the price side, but well worth it for a memorable evening out! The smoked turkey enchiladas are worth seeking out...you will not be disappointed."

133,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love the basement. Definitely worth checking out! Fun place with good food, service and atmosphere."
134,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food and good service, in Rokerij and in the bar downstairs. I had high hopes for that Green Chili Potato but it was red and not amazing. The green sauce is better than the red sauce, ask for Level 2 green sauce if you like heat. Husband loved his halibut."

138,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Linda aka (Thomas) was our server she is the best. They have the best lamb chops. The atmosphere and service are great. Everything we have tried has been wonderful. Great date night place.
139,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is one of the best hidden treasures you will find in the valley! Some of the menu is the same as Richardson's, and there's more. This place is set up to look and feel just like the Richardson's restaurant that burned down years ago. ‚Ä¶"
140,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Great food, Great staff. Definitely one of my favorite places in Phoenix. But you have to Enjoy the atmosphere and relax. Yes, it's not your average chain restaurant, but that's what makes it special. Perfect for a date night or just to meet up with friends."
141,Rokerij III, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We have been going here for years, this last visit was great again but I do not recommend the pork belly Benedict. First meal I have not enjoyed here. Very tough and not smoky at all. The atmosphere was still romantic and peaceful!"
142,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is one of my favorite places to bring someone who has not experienced the Rokerij. Every person I have brought had good things to say about the ambiance and service. Staff is knowledgeable on food and drink.
143,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Their downstairs area is by far one the most unique in the valley. I question even posting about it because it's so small and already difficult at times to get a table or chairs. Food is great but pricey so probably not an every day dining ‚Ä¶
144,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Quiet atmosphere and amazing food with large portions.  A bit pricey but was worth it!
145,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great downstairs bar. Taps are pretty unique and cocktails looked great although I didn't sample them. A great place to bring a girl if you are looking to make things really intimate and bring that first date akwardness to the next level.
146,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Again I have not had the most experience with New Mexican cuisine but this place is definitely awesome. Their steak is amazing and one of the best things they have is their green chile potato it is delicious. The one downside is this place ‚Ä¶
147,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food here is top notch and I have had this on my personal wine and dine regularly list. Between the environment, food and service you will be sure to come back. The hatch chilis are what make this food so savory and certainly a bit ‚Ä¶"

152,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Going to Rokerij restaurant and bar for the first time was a treat and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The name means ""Smoke House"" in Dutch language but you don't see anyone smoking! The menu is extensive and the restaurant provides brunch, ‚Ä¶"

162,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,a year ago,Had the best time there. The service was impeccable and the food was spectacular. Can't wait to go back again!
163,Rokerij III, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Ambience and atmosphere is 10 of 10 especially for date night. The food however is a hit or miss. Sliders with carne abodada was dry with no sauce. Calamari was lightly breaded and tender and delicious as usual  but a pretty small portion ‚Ä¶
164,Rokerij III, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food was very good but everything else was awful!!  I set a reservation over a week in advance to celebrate a milestone birthday in our family.  We were forced to be at a table next door (Richardson's).  I did not want to go to Richardson's ‚Ä¶

176,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great ambiance. Sat at bar where you can watch the chef cook. Enjoyed some small plates and food was delicious. The taste is of a southwestern flair, you will not be disappointed!"
177,Rokerij III, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Meh. The sofa style seats are filthy and full of crumbs. Food was an odd mix of really great (brussel sprouts), to really bad (tasteless carne asada), to so-so (salty steak). Service sucked, had to get cocktails remade, she never brought out the promised soup, water glasses had fishy smell. Not a good experience."
178,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great food, service and fun speak-easy type bar downstairs. Highly recommend this restaurant"
179,Rokerij III, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Steak tartar.  We go out of our way for the steak tartar here.  MMmmm... it keeps moving around the menu (and once fell off the menu, but we had made a special trip for it and they made it for us!).  We like to consume it with a Manhattan - ‚Ä¶"

192,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Best green chili pork around
193,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Just great southwestern style food. Service was great and our meals were spicy but not overly so. A really good meal overall.
194,Rokerij III, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Waaaaay too crowded, like elbow to elbow crowded. So, I was very uncomfortable. The food was ok, just ok. I couldn't order my usual because the menu constantly changes (I don't like that). Too pricey for just some ok food. But they have GREAT WINE though."
195,Rokerij III, 4 stars ,5 years ago,This was our first time at Rokerij.  There was a little confusion of where to sit us although there were several open spots. PBS was there filming so I think the staff was a little distracted but everyone was super nice. Our server was a ‚Ä¶
196,Rokerij III, 3 stars ,10 years ago,"Good food, but overpriced.  I didn't see the basement, but the ground floor is small and has a dungeon feel to it as there are no windows in the dining room.  It felt very pretentious.  They don't have straws, which is very odd.  At these prices, I won't be back."
197,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Pricey but worth it.
198,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I love the cozy atmosphere of this place and the food is unique but tasty. The creme brulee is the best I've had in the valley and the waiters are all very knowledgeable about the menu. I would highly recommend.
199,Rokerij III, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Slow service. Overpriced. Very very very overpriced. Cuisine is limited. Everything was subpar tastewise. Best part was when one server played harmonica for us on the way out. Don't go there for food. Go for date drinks and ambiance ONLY.
200,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty menu, everything I have had was excellent. Extremely pricy , but it is great spot to treat yourself,  impress a date or take mom to brunch."

213,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Happy hour was wonderfully priced!   Ribs were tasty and tangy. Enchiladas have a bite with red sauce.

216,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I can't believe I didn't know this place existed and I really should be keeping it to myself because it's already very popular. Great great great food and happy hour. Bartenders are very friendly and even gave us a history lesson on gin haha
217,Rokerij III, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Service was really good the place is really nice but unfortunately  hamburger that I ordered was probably the saltiest thing I've ever tried to eat the cheese that they had on it made it incredibly salty and the onion rings had a great coating on them but were soggy and not crispy
218,Rokerij III, 1 star ,2 years ago,I can honestly say that was one of the worst dining experiences ever. From the hostess to the server and more importantly the food. It's a beautiful establishment but the service and food was just awful.

238,Rokerij III, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Every time I go here for brunch/lunch I think it will be great and it ends up being merely okay.  They have some solid options but it is semi pricey and fairly average overall.
239,Rokerij III, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Cool place with great food.  Sort of pricey, but worth it if you're willing to spend.  Downstairs is a unique experience."
