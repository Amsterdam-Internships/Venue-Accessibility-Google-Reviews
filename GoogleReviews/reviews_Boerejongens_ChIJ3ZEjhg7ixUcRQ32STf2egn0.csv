1,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Their products are TOP ! Nice menu and GREAT hash collection. If you're a hash lover, this is your place! Don't go to the central one because it is always crowded. Take a walk and enjoy the city and visit their less crowded one. You won't regret it."
2,Boerejongens, 1 star ,a month ago,"Had a very strange encounter today with one of the sales guys at boerenjongens Amsterdam West. I went up to the counter, tried to look at the menu when out of nowhere the sales guy deactivated the menu screen. When asking him if I could see ‚Ä¶"

17,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Of all the shops i visited during my time in Amsterdam, this was my favorite by far.  This shop is a bit of a walk from the center of the city, and so worth it the shop has a dispensary feel. Very clean and professional space, the staff is ‚Ä¶"

26,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The Best in its most classic form üòé take away only!
27,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best Coffeeshop in Amsterdam, probably in the whole of Netherlands. Amazing buds on a decent price. Staff is friendly and enjoys serving you. Prices are for everyone - 8 euros if you're a cheapass like me up to 15, 16 for designer buds."
28,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,2 years ago,how on Earth do you pronounce the name of this place?!? Either way great quality stuff. Space cakes are out of this world. Staff is super cool and helpful. One of the few coffee shops that don't have a wierd creepy vibe
29,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place was unbelievable. The upstairs lounge was a really great place to pass some time. the Leather armchairs were comfortable and the whole place had a very classy vibe to it. Probably the best and certainly the most unique I've been ‚Ä¶
30,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is a professional run shop with tremendous knowledgable and friendly people. The ‚Äústuff‚Äù is of outstanding quality at acceptable prices. And the best? You don‚Äôt have the usual stigma. Shop style is more like a pharmacy with modern interieur. Customer base seem to consist of local people and more mature foreigners. Recommended!
31,Boerejongens, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Me and my wife on Sunday 16th February specifically went out of the usual tourist traps to visit Boerejongens. We walked in encountering a rude member of staff, with no manners my wife was asked to remove her wooly hat (bear in mind we had ‚Ä¶"
32,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing! A cannabis pharmacy! Clean, spacious, helpful and friendly staff, good prices, a range of different edibles - red velvet cake highly recommended! Not as busy as the shop in the city centre, but still gets crowds. Definitely worth a visit!"
33,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,8 months ago,As always top quality - but I regret to say it's not the same as it was before corona. So keep it up boys :)
34,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The service was very professional, but a little rushed. The store is a out of town, and frequented mostly by locals. The weed quality and selection is exceptional. And i rank Boerejongens in the much disputed No.1 place to stock up."
35,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great local spot. Weed is great quality and always a good price. But the best thing is the staff. Always honest and friendly and never any attitude. And that for a coffeeshop in Amsterdam is a rarity. This one is more for locals, but there is one for tourists in the centre."
36,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is absolutely the best coffeshop in the town!! No jokes.
They have been my favourite shop since i start to living here in amsterdam.
Serious, cool, funny.... ‚Ä¶"
37,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My first experience with cannabis store in Amsterdam.

Only downside is that you can't smoke here, there is a room you can use to roll ‚Ä¶"
38,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This was an amazing experience. Never before have I been in such a professional coffeeshop. It feels like the reception of a 5-star hotel. The strains I tried are lovely, light with a lovely effect. Had plans to walk around town a bit more, but let‚Äôs say plans changed after half a pure pre-rolled with a friend..."
39,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great strains I had the Cheesecake, Ramatam, & Blue Magic! Best cannabis I‚Äôve ever had & their prices are great! The people there are very nice friendly people. Thank you I‚Äôll be back!"

52,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love this place, it has a very cool vibe to it with the sellers in white lab coats. They have a good selection and great produce which is relatively inexpensive (‚Ç¨10 ish for a gram of haze). The staff are always friendly and they do great ‚Ä¶"
53,Boerejongens, 4 stars ,4 years ago,A place like this is better to buy your smoke rather than a coffee shop. You can't smoke here but there's a diverse menu with something for a novice to a regular smoker. All of your paraphernalia needs are available here too.
54,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great strains and (usually) very professional staff. Went during my first visit in Amsterdam and had to go back during my second. ‚Ä¶
55,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great shop! Great service! Great price! Great selection! The best shop i've been to!
56,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We visited several coffeeshops while on a recent trip to Amsterdam.  Boerejongens was our favorite.  Some of the best weed we've ever had. Lemon ice!  So sticky hard to roll but so good! We kept going back for more. Wish we could have ‚Ä¶

58,Boerejongens, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I like this place and I was always pleased with the service that I received. But today something changed. I asked a guy at the desk ""could you recommend some strong indica?"", but he laughed at me and just pointed me to the menu and started offering something completely irrelevant to my request. It was not nice at all."
59,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best shop ever!!!! Anywhere, any time, any place best bud best price best shop best everything period."
60,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic staff, super strains (all from Amsterdam Genetics) with a great attitude. Feels more like a friendly neighborhood pharmacy than a coffeeshop, which I definitely prefer. Best coffeeshop if you are looking for professional service and quality herb."
61,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Early morning 0700 open. Great time when you are an early bird. Only negative, they didn't have what I wanted at first due to the early morning and had not restocked but I ended up having a backup because I did my research before I went!! Great help from the people there as well!"

63,Boerejongens, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"If your a Dutch local then you probably have nothing bad to say about this place,  but if your an expat/tourist buying bud here be wary that most the bud tenders are incompetent and have a different attitude toward customers that are not ‚Ä¶"
64,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great coffeeshop! Professional and friendly staff, with a selection of the best weed and hash sold at affordable prices. The locals' top choice, not a tourist trap. Definitely one of the best coffeeshops around. Always top!"

67,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Good products, professional and friendly service. Located in a residential neighborhood with parking."
68,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Quality weed for a upscale price, tasty buds seems like they allways sell good flushed weed. The only downside about this shop is as u walk in the doctors coats make u feel its medical weed they also sell, but the hard reality is they dont ‚Ä¶"

77,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best coffeeshop experience I had ever had! Almost so friendly it became awkward for me because I'm used to angry and grumpy people behind the counter
78,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best shop in Amsterdam by far... maybe even al of holland. Space brownies are amazing. The have uniek strains that you will not find anywhere else in Holland and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. A sure stop when I am in Amsterdam. There other coffee shops in center and around the corner are just as good.
79,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice place with a small smoking area. More of a take away spot. Pleasant, knowledgeable budtenders with lab coats. I'd recommend OG Kush for some relaxing times. Not bad for around ‚Ç¨5.00 for a pre-rolled joint."

87,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Good quality and price! Nice service
88,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The brownie was very good. The hash though did not live up to the hype. The white choco hash was not as good as everyone made it out to be. Still very good regardless!!
89,Boerejongens, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Amazing coffeeshop! Had the pleasure of visiting a couple of times at the start of January whilst I was in Amsterdam for a week! The distance from the centre is only a benefit, the walk is absolutely beautiful there and back. Amazing high ‚Ä¶"
