0,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,a year ago,We were very curios to try this fusion Indonesian-Chinese place in the heart of Amsterdam by the great Ron. Expectations were not disappointed! We sat at the bar and had an impeccable service by the barman (manager?) - compliments to him ‚Ä¶
1,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,This is hands down one of the best restaurants in Amsterdam. Everything we ate was incredible. I would highly recommend the octopus starter üëå
2,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Easy reservation system, staff is polite and helpful in communication. When you arrive you‚Äôre greeted warmly.
Asian inspired menu dominates, with a variety of dim sum available (see photo of ‚Ä¶"
3,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Great service, nice cocktails and lovely snacks. Just the main course I found a bit boring and too sweet."
4,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Superb service, excellent food. The spicy heat in each of the dishes was superb, vegetarian choices were lovely. Dennis behind the bar was a legend."
5,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super delicious! We were here for Restaurant Week, and they served a 3-course menu of dimsum, peking duck, and a fun dessert of white chocolate and passion fruit sorbet. The wagyu shumai was delicious. We intend on returning just for that ‚Ä¶"
6,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Read about Ron in a NY Times article a few years ago and have been looking forward to visiting. We were very pleased with the cocktails, the great choices of food... all delicious, and the warm service."
7,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was good, but for such a place you expect it to be at least a bit interesting and exciting. The only dish that was actually interesting and unique was the ""Surprise egg"" dessert. Other dishes - 3 from the Dim Sum category and one ‚Ä¶"
8,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,a year ago,Have been here many times but haven‚Äôt been here for 3 years ... It is a unique to present Asian food. Pricy and super delicious. Beer now for ‚Ç¨6 is really expensive
9,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 1 star ,3 years ago,I cannot recommsnd this restaurant at all. Very small portions and tha dishes I orderd was soo spicey that I couldn‚Äòt eat it at all. Only the small fish is in it for 15 Euro. Realy a bad quality. And for that very expensive. Service was good.
10,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice mood, really nice food, well as I am not a big fan of fish that part is not for me but rest of my friends liked that also a lot..."
11,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Lovely, delicious food. Terribly loud music though! It makes it hard to have a good conversation while enjoying the beautiful food."
12,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Accidently reserved a table at the other location, very friendly staff got me a bar spot at this location. Fantastic food and staff!"
13,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic dim sum! Innovative and rich, with great service to boot. Would go again and recommend to anyone. They even have some good whiskeys."
14,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,a year ago,"The place looks nice, the service is great. However, as a vegetarian I was extremely disappointed. If a restaurant positions itself as 'high end' in the market, this high end service should not be reserved for specific dietary preferences ‚Ä¶"
15,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"nice try.
American people can say it is great.
Asian people can say it is...something..different.
good wine list."
16,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Top, really good food, gentle and helpfull staff. Good drinks üëåüèª"
17,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great food and excellent service. Although the surprise egg dessert was rather cliche.
18,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Amazing food and drink. Staff really friendly.
19,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,a year ago,"First visit at Rons Gastrobar Downtown. We took advantage of Early Fork Benefit. Very nice ambiance, fantastic murals and friendly staff.  The price/quality ratio of the dishes could be better. For example, the price of the rice table is ‚Ä¶"

21,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was very nice. Peking duck was amazing. The lady who was responsible for our table could work on her manners a bit. Only offering one at the table a drink, things like that. But all things considered, very nice!"
22,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,So I've had two great and one mediocre experience here. All in all recommended. Very good Peking duck. Food pricing is very reasonable. It's easy to drive the price up with their excellent bar though.
23,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What a great experience, the team, atmosphere and most importantly, the food.

Cocktails are quite basic, so stick with the wine for your dim sum parings. If ‚Ä¶"
24,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very decent place with unique dishes.
All the main dishes cost 15 Eur each, but not that you need like 2 of them to make a regular sized dish at any other restaurant. All meals are put on the table ‚Ä¶"
25,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent all around. I think the best thing to do here is get as many small plates and as much variety of dim sum that you can handle. The beef short rib was amazing, but I felt little silly missing out on so many options after. Also, the house cocktail list is legit."
26,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very good asian food with a fusion touch.  The dim sum are great, and the drinks menu is very good, too."
27,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Had four dishes in total at this place. Dim sum wagyu appetizer, The soft shell crab, Thai beef salad and squid in black bean sauce. The portions of each of the aforementioned dishes are tiny, which is fine because they mention is shared ‚Ä¶"
28,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a trendy restaurant in Amsterdam Centrum, part of a series by Ron. This one is an oriental style fine dining establishment. The decor is very tastefully done, and I enjoyed the artwork on the wall. ‚Ä¶"
29,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere, food even better. We shared the duck spring rolls and wagyu dimsum to start, both were great, the dim sum was especially well seasoned with plenty of tender, juicy meat inside. For mains we chose a selection of dishes, the ‚Ä¶"
30,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We went with friends from
Hamburg and expected an amazing dinner but were really disappointed. I can‚Äôt recommend to go and I will explain why. Go somewhere else there are way better ‚Ä¶"
31,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had a great experience at Ron Gastrobar so we decided to visit the Oriental one as well - we were not disappointed. The food was delicious! The waygu beef dim sums are a must, and all the main dishes have great flavours. It was a very ‚Ä¶"
32,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very cosy and popular asian restaurant. The food was fantastic and if you have a group of up to 3 the best spot in the place is at the bar facing the kitchen. Nothing better than watching the amazing staff at work. ‚Ä¶
33,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food overall. My starter, a shrimp dish, was cooked to mush. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the food.
Nice ambience. The staff is kind but a little slow. Recommended if you like Chinese (inspired) dishes."
34,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"There are many different kinds of small dishes to try such as dim sum and small Asian bites to share. Some were very good, some were just so so. In general very tasty food. Service was  excellent and fast. A bit pricey for what you get in my opinion."
35,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice atmosphere. Food is OK, but expensive - however the whole crispy Duck is just amazing and deserves appraisal and is well worth every penny. It comes with  steamed buns which was a nice change from the standard rice tortillas... Go for the duck - its expensive, but big enough for 3 adults which makes the price quite ok!"
36,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Service was fairly poor. We had 3 different servers over the course of our meal. The person who appeared to be the manager of the servers was running around like a mad woman and she seemed visibly upset. ‚Ä¶
37,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Rystafel and Peking Duck. The most authentic Peking duck I have had outside of China. Rivals the best I had in Hong Kong (and I lived there for 2 years).
Really good (attentive and knowledgeable) service. Great atmosphere as well."
38,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good restaurant which combines Asian kitchen with different influences. Compared to the other Gastrobars I have to say that I liked this place but for example prefer the normal gastrobar above this one. This has nothing to do with the quality of the food or service but is purely a personal taste.
39,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It is an asian tapas-style restaurant. Clearly, the meals are prepared with uttermost care! While the quantity are of reasonable size, as it should be in this kind of restaurant, the presentation is great and the flavors were rich. Also, if ‚Ä¶"
40,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Coming from London (cant imagine if I came from Asia) this restaurant does not make the cut. Food is oily and bland. Had a dish which was supposed to be a steak (but going on taste alone) could have easily been a butter stick. Would have given it two stars but amicable service from a hard working young man earned the third one.
41,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A stand out meal in Amsterdam. We sat at the bar and got excellent service from the waiter there - the drinks were delicious and every course was full of flavours. It is on the more expensive side of things but well worth the money
42,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"It's alright and i liked the food, but for the high end claimed and the gastro side, there's still a long way to go for excellence!!!  Hygiene in the kitchen, the order in which the food arrives, bringing a new cocktail in the same glass, cocktails...  a lot to work on, hence the 2 stars!"
43,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Quite disappointing taste of food.
Food can get really salty and sauce for pork tasted like ketchup than anything else. ‚Ä¶"
44,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Some of the best food I've ever tasted. Simple food done well is a rare thing but they've got the nail on the head here. The staff were the most pleasant and accomodating we can across during our time in Ams'.
45,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent restaurant for a small group of friends or a couple. Subtile lighting & moderate decor provides for an intimate atmosphere. Fine oriental food. Service as expected at a Michelin listed restaurant. modest collection of fine vines with choice in various price categories.
46,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great and attentive service. Amazing Dumplings, pork belly and ribs. However, after the dumplings, the dumpling soup (main course) looked a little out of place in regards to size, price and taste."
47,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very tasty. Interesting decor choice.
48,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Always a sure hit for a dinner to impress friends and dates, for a special occasion, or just a nice evening out. Now that it's combined with the Downtown, you can even choose between Chinese and Indonesian vibes, and that's even better!"
49,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Always consistently good service and pretty good food. It‚Äôs expensive compared to equivalent dishes over at, e.g. Oriental City in Nieuwmarkt, but the experience is pretty good. The duck for two is quite large, although it‚Äôs probably better to ask them to give you pancakes instead of the buns."
50,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was an amazing experience the food here was delicious and the atmosphere and service from this restaurant was impeccable. I would definitely recommend this place for a luxury Chinese food experience in Amsterdam. The price comes with the territory though, this is not a cheap eats restaurant."
51,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing place!!! Price totally worth it!!
52,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We loved every bite! Great flavor without covering the main ingredient. The grilled fat bits on the steak were like nothing I've ever had!
53,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"OVER PRICED, OVER RATED, OVER EVERTHING
If you want to spend your money on supporting somebodies reputation this is the place for you. Don't espect anything special, except huge number on your bill ‚Ä¶"
54,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing!!! The staff, ambiance, and food are incredible."
55,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"I found this place overrated. Not bad, but they just couldn't get their flavors right. To salty, other dishes to plane, to long in the deepfrier... Obviously they don't fully get the Asian hang of cooking. And their fusion dishes with goose ‚Ä¶"
56,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"very teasty food and very frindly team. prices are fair. the menu is hard to understand, but you can get hep from the ladies working there. this place acn br fitting for a date and birthday, dont miss the duck! super tasty!"
57,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,i never write reviews but this place was so amazing that it deserves it. this place was so amazing the atmosphere was beautiful the service excellent and food delicious. i was blown away by the restaurant and would highly recommend to come if you are in Amsterdam. Chef Patrick is ingenious.
58,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Service was slow and allowed peking duck to get cold as we waited for more bao buns to be brought.  For the above market prices they charge, the service should have been far more attentive and swift.  They forgot to bring several drinks after we had ordered."
59,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice food and nice presentation , but because you get small bites you need at least 3 dishes to be satisfied. Your bill will go easy to 60‚Ç¨. And I am not a big eater!!"
60,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice restaurant with great Asian food. The Peking duck is great. Dim sum are also very good. Good choice for diner with friends or in couple.
61,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is fantastic. Peking duck and wagu beef dim sum are must haves. Great options for small plates table sharing and great drinks. Decor is also well thought out, kung fu theme with Bruce Lee playing in the bathrooms. Highly recommend!"
62,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nothing to write home about. Dark ‚Äúhip‚Äù atmosphere with loud music, sub-par PF Chang‚Äôs wannabe food, and an awkward service team. The only memorable thing was the dessert, but I would not go back and definitely would not recommend it."
63,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Our Dim Sum starters were fine, but the main course (spring chicken confit) lacked flavour and was very poorly presented. Also, we waited more than an hour for our main course to arrive."
64,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best steak tartare and Peking duck we have ever had. Excellent service and a very special mention to Wouter who looked after us so well-exceptional service and one of the best in Holland!
65,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, Pekingese duck is a must . highly recommended."
66,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,6 years ago,Average.  Flavours sadly lacking in most dishes. Char sui just a mishmash of competing noise.  Lamb pancake was good primarily because it had so much chilli in it. ‚Ä¶
67,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best restuarants i have been to in Amsterdam, fantastic asian food and The duck was absolutley amazing. Go here if you have the chance, the service was super as well. Tip is to book in advance to get a table"
68,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Good food but not a good service. It¬¥s a shame because we went back to show it to some friends and turned out being a horrible experience.
69,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice food, but quite bad service. Good spare ribs, spring rolls are boring. Dim sums are simple. The best dessert is ""surprise egg""."
70,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food and great atmosphere
71,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food!! Very creative, but no over the top. Awesome combinations of spices. AND lovely staff."
72,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Asian fusion restaurant. Beautiful decor and excellent professional service.
With regard to the food, I find it rather expensive.
The portions are small but tasty."
73,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent food, though a couple of the dishes (e.g. the eggplant tempura) were on the greasy side. Very cool ambiance and great drinks."
74,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow, just wow. Adventurous dishes, very well prepared and up to the standard you'd expect. Service could be a bit more organised, but still very friendly and professional."
75,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Alright price-quality food-wise, but service level way below expectations. Also little bit pretentious."
76,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food, make sure to enjoy the pork neck. One of the most delicious dishes I've had in my life."
77,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Good food if not a bit expensive given the number of dishes you would order to fill up.  Service was slow but VERY friendly.
78,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's great place! This passion with which waiters speak about dishes - especially the youngest boy of them, it's worth to see this restaurant!"
79,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Service is great. Cuisine is good but not exeptional. Wine list is very good. Good wine even by glasses.
80,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice restaurant, good service,excellent food and good music!! If you want to have a good time this is definitely the place."
81,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This was one of the best meals I had in Amsterdam. The singapore noodles and boneless spare ribs were particular standouts.
82,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Amazing atmosphere and the food was absolutely incredible.  All sorts of tapas to try and great drinks too.
83,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Delicious food with fantastic atmosphere. The staff were sensational and now makes it my favorite place to eat out in Amsterdam
84,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Unfortunately much too expensive and not too good. We took tons of things, starters and even the Peking Duck (which costs 70 euro) - nothing was aaaaaamazing as it should have been. For 340 euro bill I expect A+++ and it was B---."
85,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good selection of Asian dishes. Duck meat is delicious and the spareribs too. Good service!
86,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food was nice. Service was unfortunately too slow (and perhaps the staff a bit inexperienced) for the prices this place charges.

94,Ron Gastrobar Oriental, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food, great wines. Lacking in choices of oriental beers, just heineken and tsing tao."
