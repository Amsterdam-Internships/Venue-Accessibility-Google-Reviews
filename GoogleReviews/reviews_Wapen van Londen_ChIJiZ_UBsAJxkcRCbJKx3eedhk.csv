0,Wapen van Londen, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"This Is the best pub that i Have ever Been to... The owner Is the great Guy...come to this place if you like good Beer And good people...
And Its Worth it..... In my opinion th√© most friendly And cozy bar.... definitely stop by"
1,Wapen van Londen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Extremely cosy bar nestled on the Amstel, very close to Rembrandtplein.  Shon and his team offer a great selection of Czech and Eastern European beers, a delicious beef Goulash, pierogi and Polish sausages in brine.  A great chill place!"
2,Wapen van Londen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A little bit of Slovak/Czech in Amsterdam style. Small bar but fine. But very expensive beer for what you maybe are used to pay for in Slovakia or Czech. For example a zlaty bazant costs you here about 6 euro! So don't  expect Slovakia or Czech prizes. It's normal to pay 6 euro for 0.5l of beer in Amsterdam.
3,Wapen van Londen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely the best bar in Amsterdam! Czech Republicüíú
4,Wapen van Londen, 1 star ,a year ago,It was a little nice bar years ago. Now its very expensive and closed on most days. 2 years ago the lady who works behind the bar tried to steal my iphone. She is still working there. Her name is Eliska. I was drunk and gave her my phone to ‚Ä¶
5,Wapen van Londen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I just went inside to drink sth, I ordered in Dutch but the girl on the bar told me to speak English; no problem at all. When I sat I actually started to recognize the concept of the bar and it is amazing. ‚Ä¶"
6,Wapen van Londen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent place, but it's not what it used to be over 10 years ago. You better watch your expenditures bill as unwanted extra charges may inadvertently be added to your overall bill. A newer and much better Czechoslovakian meeting place is at Waterhole bar directly next to Leidseplein."
7,Wapen van Londen, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I hoped I could give 0 stars because it is a really bad bar and bad service, when I wanted to pay by card, the girl who worked there told me it was ‚Ç¨2,- extra. So I think she is stealing from the tourists by telling them that, Bad service, ‚Ä¶"

12,Wapen van Londen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I like it a lot because of good beer they have here. The only minus point is that bottled beer is cheaper than tap beer, what is hard to understand. All other things are positive."
13,Wapen van Londen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice small Czech Pub with Czech food and beer. You should take a look! Pricing is also good! Thanks for the friendly service!

17,Wapen van Londen, 1 star ,3 years ago,"For me as a Slovak it was total disappointment... kofola was old, no Slovak bartender, not even Slovak or Czech song .... as Slovak or Czech don‚Äôt go here they will just rip you off your money"

Actually, the bar is also awesome. Nice and welcoming. Highly recommended."
25,Wapen van Londen, 1 star ,2 years ago,The waitress would‚Äônt let us Order food because we weren‚Äôt from Holland. She then accepted food orders from others. Not very nice.
26,Wapen van Londen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great guys andere service let a lady go to the toilet no special request. Great special Beers from chech and Slovakije.
27,Wapen van Londen, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The somewhat cozy dive bar atmosphere doesn't make up for the overpriced stale beer
