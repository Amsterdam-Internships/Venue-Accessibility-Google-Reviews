0,Golden Chopsticks, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Overall, not bad but not on my list to return. Food was edible and served hot, but not much flavor. Prices weren't bad, but 4 euro for a small water is too steep. Service was decent. Nothing to really complain about, but it didn't wow me either."
1,Golden Chopsticks, 1 star ,a month ago,"The food did not have any flavoring, the noodles were so thick and stuck to each other you could almost build a log cabin out of them.
Can only recommend the tofu I asked them to add to my dish."
2,Golden Chopsticks, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very tasty and authentic cantonese food. We ordered the chicken with ginger and spring onion, the cold version, which was really fresh and original. I recommend the noodles with crab meat, a super easy eating dish if you don't want to deal with crab shell! Overall good experience and recommended!"

4,Golden Chopsticks, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Service was amazing, but the food is hit or miss! We had eggplant with cantonese salted fish from the clay pot, which was absolutely amazing. Sadly, the cha siu was very dry, but still tasted ok."
5,Golden Chopsticks, 1 star ,a month ago,"One of the worst Chinese food I had in ages. Very tasteless, even though everything was drenched in maggi/soy sauce. My gf had super bad noodles that just tasted like glutamate and my squid was as chewy as a bike tire. Left both plates half full, even though we were both super hungry :/"
6,Golden Chopsticks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a great authentic Chinese restaurant.  After many hours of walking, we were so glad to sit down and enjoyed our hot bowls of pork and shrimp wontons.  Service is pleasant.  Interior is spacious and their bathroom is clean.  What more can you ask for in a Chinese restaurant?"
7,Golden Chopsticks, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Been coming to this Cantonese restaurant since the early 90s. Their food is consistently good, and pretty authentic. My favourites are the mussels fried in black bean sauce (see photo) and their steamed sole."
8,Golden Chopsticks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Authentic Chinese Restaurant!! I ordered green onion beef and the salt and pepper pork chop is really outstanding!! Delicious and hot! Staff are friendly with good service. Just try if you're craving for Chinese food in Amsterdam üåø
9,Golden Chopsticks, 4 stars ,11 months ago,"Very nice chinese takeaway! The traditional 'takeaway' that you expect; good asian-origin cuisine and efficient, focused staff. The prices are quite high, but the food is good. I like the wonton soup."

32,Golden Chopsticks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best Chinese food I ever had in Amsterdam. If you don't think so, either cuz you as a non-Chinese get used to fake Chinese food or you as a Chinese come from the northern part of China, love spicy food and  find Canton cuisine too light for you."

40,Golden Chopsticks, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is good, but the waitress was trying to feed rice with a fork to our 8 month old son, without asking our permission. She also commented a lot on what we did to our son, she's also telling us that giving mango as finger food isn't good. We didn't feel comfortable with the staff"
41,Golden Chopsticks, 4 stars ,5 years ago,A decent mix of western chinese food at a reasonable price given the central location.
42,Golden Chopsticks, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Well... We need to wait a minutes to sit down.. the waiter forgot two drinks and a knife.. how can eat beef with a fork and spoon? The restaurant was full at night. There isn't no offers for a group . You have to order a separate dish. About the prices 6 euros for a small soup and 10 to 20 for the other dishes.

We tried the oyster and the oysters were decent in size
45,Golden Chopsticks, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The waitress knows her menu well, and warned me of the spiciness of the noodle.. the noodle is very good. Wanton Noodle not that great.. overall... I love the spicy noodle in the cold weather. Reasonable price too during lunch set."

55,Golden Chopsticks, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The food is nice and well priced, but sadly the staff is very unfriendly. Tried to ask a question over the phone about a menu (because of a very poor layout of the website), but they refuse to answer your questions. It's a shame that you won't get the customer experience I expect when ordering my lunch."
56,Golden Chopsticks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,For me this is the best Chinese in Ams - Reminds me of the UK Chinese rather than the numerous Asian/Eastern styles which dominate the city. Prices good for the location & we ended up here in error! We were advised to go to the Chinese ‚Ä¶
