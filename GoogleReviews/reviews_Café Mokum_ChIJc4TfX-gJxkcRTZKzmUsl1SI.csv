1,Caf√© Mokum, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Located at one of the busiest squares in Amsterdam. What a laid back scene here. It was a 1-day visit for us in the city and after visiting the Van Gogh museum, we settle down here for a couple of beer. We ordered Belgian beer and chilled ‚Ä¶"
2,Caf√© Mokum, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice pub in the middle of Leidseplein, good food and lots of special beers. Friendly, cozy, I've been warmly welcomed by the crew. You can find here a selection of trappist dutch beers by La Trappe, one of the only trappist beer not coming from Belgium. Jonathan was super nice!"
3,Caf√© Mokum, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Mokum is one of the coolest and most entertaining club/pub in the city. It's a bit narrow but use the advantage of it ;) They know how to have fun and feel it to.the customers... ‚Ä¶
4,Caf√© Mokum, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice terrace with a fireplace, where you can hide from the rain. Located near Apple Store - ideal spot to spend you waiting time :) Salad with goat cheese is damn delicious, same as Queen burger. Still, not that easy to get waiters‚Äô attention, the service could be better. Also long awaiting time (30-40 min)"

8,Caf√© Mokum, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great environment and drinks and there was even a cat! But our waitress left and never told us or had anyone else take care of us. And when I asked a simple question about the menu the manager was very rude and unfriendly. The cat, beer and environment are the only reasons I‚Äôm give this 3 stars."
9,Caf√© Mokum, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"You sit in the Leidseplein surrounded by gorgeous old buildings, drinking strong beers and chilling to live music from the square. The chairs at caf√© Mokum are comfy and they have huge umbrellas with a heater in the centre which zip ‚Ä¶"
