0,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,3 months ago,This is an authentic Broodje kroket tucked away in a small street in the middle of Amsterdam. We visited this restaurant on a Friday during the lunch rush and this place was packed full of locals grabbing a quick bite. The staff is super …
1,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Mind blowing croquets!! Definitely the best I have had! Comes in many different flavours- beef, veal, cheese and some others. The store is a very intense local experience. The staff generally do not really care about confused tourists and they work at lightning speed. Locals come in here to grab their quick snack or meal."
2,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Nice warm croquettes on a bun. The place itself is like a dinner but with dutch specialities, give it a go at least for a little croquette."
3,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Van Dobben is the best known maker of the croquette in the Netherlands. It all starts in 1945. I love this place and if in Amsterdam and you want to try some dutch snacks do make it a point to go here. They also have vegetarian options and would recommend to go here.
4,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Classic! Kids prefer these traditional kroketten over McDonald’s.
Atmosphere 100% Amsterdam."
5,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 2 stars ,a month ago,"So, I have been to this place 3 times now. and 2/3 times I have had pretty bad experience. I am not going to talk about service, as they have kinda taken a perspective of ""pride"" in being rude or how they call ""Direct"", but lets talk about …"
6,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Just the best broodje kroket in the tourist area of A’dam. Also, if you really want to splurge, try the broodje hamburger. Very different than your usual hamburger as it is crispy and fried but quite good!"
7,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Simple yet delicious dishes. True authentic eetcafé experience!
8,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Very good croquetes. Tourists usually don't eat Dutch dishes when they are in Holland because Holland doesn't have a particulary good/special cuisine. This is their national pride and even though most tourists don't like it, it's worth a …"
9,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Incredible dutch croquets. I am a fan of the dutch food and this place is totally amazing. Also we tried like a sandwich with peanut sauce that was amazing (sorry I don’t know the name but I left you a picture). This is the second time that I visit this place as every time that I go to Amsterdam this is a stop that I have to do.

14,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Just a regular cantina where you can get very quick good food. I had a lot of fried stuff, which is ok (Bitterballen, Kroketten, fried cheese) but do not go there if you want some good original dutch stuff. The products mostly come out of a freezer and will be warmed up."
15,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice staff, everything was delicious. A must place."
16,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I like the mix-and-match style at this place. The interior is great and adds to the authenticity of the food. The roast beef was pretty good after I added additional seasoning. Not a fan of the bun, but guess it’s traditional Dutch-style so can’t overly complain. Definitely worth visiting!"
17,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best breakfast you can get in Amsterdam. All hams and meats are freshly cut and the rolls are super fresh. …
18,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want to experience the soul of Amsterdam, van Dobben is where you should go. The place just breathes Amsterdam dry direct humor, as the ladies behind the counter have a response to every situation. Not only are the croquettes famous …"

22,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I paid €8.55 for six balls of bitterballen and a very small coke. The balls were very hot and no utensils were provided, not as much as a toothpick, and so I had to try to eat them by hand. I was left very hungry and sad I paid so much for …"
23,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,4 years ago,If you're in Amsterdam make sure to have lunch and afternoon breaks at Van Dobben! The best and cheapest croquettes in town and maybe all the Netherlands. They have many varieties just ask:)

33,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Traditional Dutch place that opened in 1945. Food served is simple but fast and tasty. It was quite busy when we went in and we were able to get an English menu to help order. Staff were nice. Cash only. Slightly expensive for the portion sizes but a good experience in Amsterdam for getting some 'must have' foods.
34,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Amsterdam absolute must do! They have best croquettes ever!

41,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious croquettes and very nice roast beef sandwich
42,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really great place to eat some Dutch fast food. The ladies behind the bar are bubbly and friendly. There is an English menu, but they also recommend what's best. I tried the croquettes with/without bread, both delicious. The raw mince was adventurous but with the salt, pepper, onions and mustard it was decent."
43,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Nothing incredible about the kroketten in this place, you could get the same quality or even better at any fast food in Amsterdam. The staff was not really nice, we waited a long time to order but even longer to pay (the cashier was just …"
44,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The food may have been authentic but nothing amazing. We walked more than 20 minutes to get to this place after reading reviews on Google and surprisingly the place was almost empty. We placed orders for different sandwiches and croquettes …
45,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good luck here, because the menu is a mess. Almost all of the listings are sandwiches, and the one line for croquettes doesn’t say there are six varieties. I’m not a fan of any: almost entirely gravy, they remind me of cheap frozen meat …"
46,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Tasty Good if you find and try some new things from the menue card but staff is rude and do not explain or recommend some dutch specials, accept the well known krokettes which you can eat everywhere in Amsterdam"
47,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Super casual traditional Dutch place with lots of history. Does fantastic croquettes and their peanut sauce on pulled pork sandwich is from another world. Dining area itself not great though and service very Dutch therefore I recommend …
48,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"You won't get a more Dutch lunch experience than this. The ladies behind the counter are lovely and quite efficient considering how busy this little lunch room gets. The menu has all the Dutch classics mostly served on fluffy white bread. You wouldn't go hear for haute cuisine, but rather comfort food."
49,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Our last weekend of a two-week return visit brought us by a window where beautiful meats were being sliced near a huge stockpile of rolls. Imagining that these two things must be brought together nearby lured us around the corner to this …
50,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,5 years ago,One of the last places in Amsterdam that I would consider to be non-Disney. Real authentic food served by authentic Amsterdam people. It's like a unicorn in a volcano it's almost uncanny. Great place lovely service from lovely ladies and …
51,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you are curious about Dutch people's social life, this might be the right spot to visit around dinner time.

52,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"A very Dutch place. This lunchroom, which has been here for a small eternity, is home of (one of) the best croquette of Amsterdam and the Netherlands. Staff is efficient, humorous and fun, but can become impatient if a group of tourists …"
53,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Quick service, lively atmosphere with real Amsterdam and Dutch sandwich specialties such as ""broodje halfom"" with liver and salted meat and of course the best Dutch 'Van Dobben' croquet. Down to earth attitude, great taste."
54,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The legendary Amsterdam sandwich shop, famous for their kroket. The marble counter promises a quality that has not diminished over the decades and the choice of food is ample. You are guarantied a service with a smile and more often than not a dose of the real Amsterdam humour. Essential visit."
55,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is very dutch, truly authentic, however not very special. I guess taste differs per person ;) The service is friendly but sometimes not as hygienic as you would expect, they touch the foods with their hands without plastic gloves …"

63,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"I feel like this place is hyped up too much.  Cheap small-medium sized plates offer decent quality food, seems like it could be good after a late night of partying, but don't bother planning for a meal here.  The waitresses seem to be friendlier to locals, touché."

66,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Unlike many of the other places I've been on this trip, everything here was exclusively written in Dutch, but the friendly employees still spoke English. Just be aware that even though there's a card reader it's European cards only here."
67,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"As I manage a local tour guide agency this is a local institution and a regular place for me. If first time and dont speak Dutch here are a few tips.
Sit yourself down. We recommend the front bar where they can serve you well. …"
68,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Authentic Dutch place. Definitely give the typical ""croquette"" a chance. The staff made me laugh listening to their convo's. Original ""Amsterdammers"". If some might experience rudeness or lack of service I that will be bacause of a cultural difference, not malicious intent."
69,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is one of the best options in the center of the city with good croquettes and more! Loved by locals and keeps the same quality for many years! Totally worth it a visit for a quick bite 😉
70,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 1 star ,3 years ago,"There are absolute unsanitary conditions! A woman/cashier was coughing into her hand, and with the same hand, without washing, she touched the bread and meat for sandwiches! While making a sandwich she touched her neck, took her hairs away …"
71,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,a year ago,Cool little local Eatery serving Dutch specialities. Buttermilk and croquettes are very popular with the locals and are a must try
72,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Classic must go place for a good old Dutch roll with meat. Filet américain, tartaar speciaal, halfom, warm vlees are classics to be tried here, before anywhere else."
73,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"I come to Holland once a year and a visit to van Dobben for a ""broodje kroket"" is always on the program. The food is delicious and the personnel is very friendly. I recommend this place to everyone."

77,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Not quite the place if you aren't very much of a fan of traditional Dutch food and broodjes in particular. Don't expect a remarkable culinary experience there.

88,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Good food
89,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Food was amazing (the shrimp croquette in particular) but the ladies who work there seem to have forgotten the importance of customer service or simple politeness.
90,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Authentic local food. Try their ""Brodje Croquet"",  you wouldn't find any better local food than this. The lady is usually busy at the counter, so be patient."
91,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,Staff is rude and unprofessional.
92,Eetsalon Van Dobben, 5 stars ,5 years ago,A 'broodje croquet' at Van Dobben can even give your worst day of the week a silver lining. Don't forget the mustard and have a glass of cold milk on the side.
