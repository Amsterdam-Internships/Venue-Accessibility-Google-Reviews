6,Chinese Indonesian Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A good Chinese restaurant. Prices are reasonable too. Ambience is nice. If you do shopping around, this place is a great place to start to have dinner."
7,Chinese Indonesian Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Chinese Indonesian restaurant on a side alley in the central district.  Good valve,  but a little bland, although this is the first time I've had Indonesian,  so maybe that was how it was supposed to be."
8,Chinese Indonesian Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I'm impressed by the old man serving as he appears  to be a one man team at the front - getting orders, running orders, and bussing tables. The food is fine. Nice moody Chinese vibe with the lights."
9,Chinese Indonesian Restaurant, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food is good but not the best one... you can find more tasty dishes around!!!

16,Chinese Indonesian Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Ordered fried noodle and fried rice. I'd say the taste is very close to what we've got in Indonesia (chinese-indo or peranakan style). Very authentic and the portion is generous
17,Chinese Indonesian Restaurant, 1 star ,2 years ago,The shrimp wanton were out of date and have been replaced but the new ones were still undercooked... not authentic Chinese food at all. Please avoid it.
