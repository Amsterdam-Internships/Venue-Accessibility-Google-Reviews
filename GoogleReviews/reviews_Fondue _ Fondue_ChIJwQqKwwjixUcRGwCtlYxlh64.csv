0,Fondue & Fondue, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Lovely and cozy. The fondue was very yummy. I loved it. It was my second time and I‚Äôll come back for sure. Very small place but is nice vibe. The service is good.
1,Fondue & Fondue, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Great fondue and good service and reasonable price. The restaurant a little bit cramp in term of space and seating. For these time of covid situation, you don't feel like to sitting near someone not in your family. Other than that everything Great."
2,Fondue & Fondue, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Cute restaurant with great service. We had a meat and a cheese fondue and they were great! The cheese fondue is gluten free and they have gluten free bread. Unfortunately the meat one is not gluten free. Would recommend as a fun place for dinner
3,Fondue & Fondue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fundue & Fondue was excellent. I can highly recommend both the food and the service there. ‚Ä¶
4,Fondue & Fondue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty menu! We had some starters, then the meat and Dutch Cheese fondue, and then the Chocolate one. Worth trying them all :P Great service: Staff are helpful, trying to make everything to make you comfortable, attentive and smiley!
Place is very cosy. But it's small, so  A RESERVATION IS A MUST"
5,Fondue & Fondue, 4 stars ,a month ago,Good food / service is very friendly and super attentive - great job!!
6,Fondue & Fondue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A great experience. Our waiter was super friendly, quick and attentive and gave great recommendations for food and wine. A younger waiter appeared bored and seemed to purposely ignore you when trying to get his attention (which was a pity) - however a really wonderful evening. Definitely a spot we‚Äôll be going back to!"
7,Fondue & Fondue, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"We us the cheese fondue, Pinot Grigio and Lost Lugagge (wine). The food was tasty, especially the veggies, Pinot Grigio also great, lost luggage a bit rough. The service was putting in an effort but very disorganized and slow. Upon paying ‚Ä¶"
8,Fondue & Fondue, 3 stars ,4 years ago,What a feast! Barely walked back home. Wine selection might be wider. Excellent service (props for late playlist üòç) pics before & after

10,Fondue & Fondue, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing cheese fondue! Delicious chocolate fondue, nice service!"
11,Fondue & Fondue, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I come from Lugano, Switzerland, and this is so far the best fondue I have ever had! The classic one is even better than the one I used to eat at home! The service was also really friendly and accurate with the wine's match! If you go to Amsterdam you must pass through."
12,Fondue & Fondue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food and huge portions! Totally worth the price! Highly recommend!
13,Fondue & Fondue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic fondue, great selection of wines, takes me back to my time spent in Switzerland. Unfortunately loses one star as the restaurant itself is too tightly packed, maybe lose a table or two? It was also extremely hot inside."
14,Fondue & Fondue, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely place for a cozy night out. We tried the Dutch cheeses fondue and it was pretty good; you can get this with meat but the menu can also be adapted to fit a vegetarian diet.
15,Fondue & Fondue, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is great for fondue! Meat or cheese, were here for a team event and they were very accommodating for our group, even making one fondue with no alcohol. It's a cozy place so best to book, and good value for money, none of us left hungry."
16,Fondue & Fondue, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food isn't great, but the good staff made it a better experience. Our whole table ordered the vegetarian option and bacon was put on each salad. Also, small pickles were served to go in the fondue, some other option would have been better suited."
17,Fondue & Fondue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Staff is very kind. They have starters, multi-course menus and 3 types of fondues. Waiter takes the time to explain. We just wanted a burger though so this wasnt our place."
18,Fondue & Fondue, 3 stars ,3 years ago,On the expensive side. Lovely ambiance. Our waiter was not attentive at all. The place is small and he kept passing me 3x with my hand raised and yet still didn‚Äôt do anything. Just eventually gave up. Didn‚Äôt realize the ‚Äúmeat‚Äù fondue didn‚Äôt come with cheese. Truffle cheese fondue was delicious.
19,Fondue & Fondue, 1 star ,4 years ago,Walked into an empty restaurant 15 minutes after opening while on vacation to surprise my wife. Was told we could sit but we but we would only be allowed an hour to eat because of their full reservation list at 7. Every other place we had ‚Ä¶

22,Fondue & Fondue, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Very good food for Amsterdam standards. We had cheese and meet fondue and was really good. The salads were indifferent. Very friendly stuff which is rare! It's better to make a reservation and the place is very small
23,Fondue & Fondue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"An amazing atmosphere,  it's quite small and homely. And you can look right into the kitchen. The staff was really friendly and food was prepared rather quickly. Definently a worthwile place to visit if you are nearby."
24,Fondue & Fondue, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great food and service. We were a group of 4 and made the mistake of all ordering the meat fondue as we were fondue rookies and didn't realised the meet was cooked in a broth fondue and not cheese.  If we had our choice again we would choose 2 x Meat and 2 x Cheese and share.
25,Fondue & Fondue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Heerlijk eten bij fondue&fondue gastvrijheid Amazing.

33,Fondue & Fondue, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent service. Fantastic food. Really liked cooking in broth instead of oil.  The only issue is public transportation is limited later in the evening
34,Fondue & Fondue, 4 stars ,6 years ago,We had to wait quite long even though we had a reservation. But it was worth the wait. Super friendly stuff and the food was just great. We had a 3 course menu and nothing disappointed us.
35,Fondue & Fondue, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Great place. Friendly stuff. Medium high prices. Nothing negative to say, if it would not be for this: if you are with two, one must order the same kind of fondue. Limitations that takes 4 stars away."

39,Fondue & Fondue, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The cheese fondue is great!  Excellent with broccoli, bread, and potatoes.  The meat fondue was so-so.  The salad with mayo dressing and bell peppers was AMAZING."
40,Fondue & Fondue, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"Potatoes were overcooked and too salty, tuna did not look fresh and flies in wine. We mentioned our disappointment to the waiter who did not apologised nor took any initiative. Had to pay the full bill."
41,Fondue & Fondue, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent staff, very good food, I ate gambas pil-pil starter, Dutch kaas fondue, and chocolate fondue."
