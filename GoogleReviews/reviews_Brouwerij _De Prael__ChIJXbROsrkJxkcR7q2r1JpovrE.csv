3,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,7 months ago,"We found this place by mistake given the fact that is on an alley hidden from the Main Street, but do not let that fool you. The staff is really friendly, they hire people from different backgrounds and all have a story to tell, the beer is …"

6,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,7 months ago,Cute little brewery in the city center of Amsterdam. Beer was very good. Bill was 12€ tipped up 13€ but the Bartender gave in 15€ that's why it's 4/5 stars
7,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,a month ago,"Cozy brewery but our experience wasn't that great. We were received by a very friendly waiter who sat us down at the bar. However, the waiter that served us behind the bar was a bit rude like he didn't want to attend us because we weren't …"
8,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Large selection including Dutch varieties like Lentebok.  Marzen is solid, Rauchbier was well balanced but the Kinky Koos Spiced Saison stood out with just a hint of basil.  Weissbiergunder was surprisingly good, never even heard of a wheat beer fermented with grape juice.  The snackplatter added to our enjoyment."
9,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is big and have nice vibes, ideal for groups. The staff is friendly and proactive. They have a nice variety of drinks and food. There is a slight waiting time around 20 minutes. The portion sizes are different. For example, the …"

11,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Brewery with a great ambience right by ams central. It's easy to miss this since it's on a narrow side street. They have a good selection of beers and a decent food menu. Their flight of 5 beers is a good choice to have!  I felt service was slow, they have a lot of tables and not enough servers. Buy I will definitely visit again"
12,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A really great place to grab a beer. Brouwerij has managed to make a stunning variety of beers. I’m not the biggest fan of bitter beers, but there are still a good few that come with less bitterness. The Bitter and Bitterblond are excellent …"
13,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Its a nice little brewery in the middle of an Alley, quite hidden.

Outside seating is not really a blast as its just Wooden tables next to …"
14,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great craft beer bar with the plus of being also a brewery with a wide variety o beers, over 12 different beer and 10 on tap. They even had flight/sampler to enjoy them more candidly! Pretty amazing facilities, comfortable lounge and bar. Great service, very knowledgeable and helpful, they even helped me charge my phone!"
15,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Some nice drinks and they have board games! Def recommend The Kinky Koos, not the greatest music however."
16,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,Marsh was an incredible server. Had two flights of incredible locally-brewed beer. What a find in an otherwise touristy area. The pretzel was the best I have ever had. One of my favorite places in my entire Europe trip. Very chill atmosphere. Would come back here in a heartbeat.  Be sure to check out the gift shop too!
17,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,3 years ago,"No take out or to go! While the food looked and tasted amazing I would have ordered a lot less had I known I could not take my leftovers with me for another meal.as you can see I ordered a cheese plate meatballs, and a burger. The lack of …"
18,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Excellent! Beer selection on draught is expansive, atmosphere of the dining area was great, and staff are attentive. 10/10 recommend if you are looking for a great brewery for drinks and/or food. DIPA was great."
19,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 1 star ,2 years ago,"Encountered unbelievable hostility in this tavern, no clue at all. Waiters abruptly showed at the table and asked why we asked for three empty plates as we were obviously sharing all the dishes. Was told they were “a brewery not a …"
20,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place to hangout in of the comfy chairs and have their own local brewed beer (Weizen is still my favorite). The beer tasting of 5 beers is also nice! And yes they have the best bitterballen I've ever had!! They even have a vegan version of them ✌️Go here, you won't regret!"
21,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,"To have such a brewery right in the heart of Amsterdam is great! It does feel a little bit tourist like, wonder if many locals still visit the brewery pub. …"

23,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very nice brewery with nice stuff and a long selection of craft brews. You can see a bit of the brewery at the back and it has. Avery nice vibe in the city center!
24,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Went here for some drinks only. We had the Triple, Stout,  and Bitter Blonde. They were all very good and had great smooth texture. However, the lady bartender there was extremely unfriendly and somewhat rude. Would have rated it 5* if she just smile and say hi once :)"
25,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Awesome atmosphere, amazing beer epic meals and excellent snacks.  Love the hiring process for this bar and brewery.  They hire people who have a herd time getting a job so some can be shy but always very polite and friendly. …"
26,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,4 months ago,"I used to love this place but the quality has decreased considerably. Last time we went the food wasn't great, the place was smelly (really bad) and the beer glasses were not super clean. Time for some improvements."
27,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very relax place,nice food and there are a lot of different beer.
Lovely people. Good service.
Special thanks to Ruud!  A great guy."
28,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasted 8 beers, enjoyed the Australian Lager, Bitter Blonde, and Wheat.  Found the Alt Bier to be sour, not a good representative of the style.  The Scotch Ale had a hint of smoke, the Dubbel and Tripel are high alcohol and had a hard time concealing that fact.  IPA was ok."
29,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Been here twice: first time I've had an hamburger, it was good but nothing special. Happy I got back and tried the spicy chicken, which I loved!
The beer was great, as always."

31,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,My second favorite brewery in Amsterdam. Variety of good beers (made on the site) at competitive prices and nice ambience. They have also decent meals and snacks. The burger was pretty good.
32,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Good place to have some beer, and a meal if you're hungry. Avoid evening peak hours though, it can be crowded and loud inside."
33,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good bar tucked away from the hustle and bustle. Beer menu is all from the brewery itself and there's a good range including wheat, pales, IPA and Belgian Quads. Seemed to have a decent food menu as well but didn't eat here."
34,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,a year ago,"We just happened to be passing this place, saw someone sampling a flight of beers and thought we’d give it a try. We are so glad we did! The beer is great, brewed on site, and the servers are attentive and friendly. We’ll definitely be going back soon!"
35,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice place for beers and food, but slow serving. Sometimes you may need to repeat couple of times what you ordered"
36,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great place. Nice goals. Food and beer pair very well. Also a great place to host an event.
37,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 months ago,I just can make a review about the beer and this was very delicious. Highly recommendable location with a good service.

39,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Very quiet for lunch, perfect place to relax with a good meal. The burger was perfect and the fries were gigantic. The beer selection is large, covering many styles and flavors."
40,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Friendly staff, great food, amazing beers! 100% recommended."
41,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I searched high and low for this brewery and am so glad we found it! The Blonde was fantastic and the bitterballens were delicious. Really lovely seating areas, lots of space, nice and bright, and located around the red light district so lots of fun in the neighborhood. Definitely worth tracking down!"
42,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great brewery tucked down a small street in the Red Light District. I've never had a beer here I didn't like. Plenty of cozy seating and a small outdoor space.
43,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is nice and usually crowded. They serve their own brewed beer at regular Amsterdam prices. However, the place is understaffed, and those that do work there are unfriendly. Haven't tried the food, but it looked really delicious."
44,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best beers in Amsterdam, also an awesome Nachos . Take the tasting beer you won’t regret"
45,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,Was recommended to come here by one of the locals. They have different variations of craft beer. Some place to unwind at the center of the busy city.

49,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place was so good. A great atmosphere, nice beers and a nice change from the too-crowded, stag party, stoned crowd just around the corner. The thing that really made it special though were the staff. They really made our night. A great place."
50,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good adventurous selection of brews and somewhat sarcastic staff selling it. ""You don't want that"" is what they say to anyone enquiring about liquid bacon. And rightly so. Still, they sell it. I only had an hour so I had to be quick; …"
51,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,Check this spot out after you get off the train at Centraal Station. It's super close by and has delicious beers and tasty food. There are a handful of rooms each with different types of seating so you'll for sure find a place to sit that's perfect for you. Check them out! They do awesome things for the community and are super friendly.
52,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Try the beer tasting menu, it includes 4 draughts, water and salted/ roasted peanuts. Beer is amazing. The place has a nice personal touch to it. Plenty of seating space. They accept credit card."
53,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice place for some locally brewed beers, though quite a noisy place for my taste."
54,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 months ago,Amazing brewery tucked away in main Amsterdam.  The food was so good and the beers even better!

58,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Fantastic atmosphere, excellent collection. Must visit for any beer lover."
59,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Two guys who carried out careers in social services teamed up later in life to create this place based on two things they had in common, a love of beer and a desire to help people who need a little extra assistance. De Prael is making some …"
60,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is a funky spot to stop and drink some really good beer. Several different styles on tap. The cheese platter was great.
61,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fun brewery in the red light district, just a few minutes walk from Amsterdam Central station. The brew their own beer, which is pretty good.
Tip: order the sampler to get a taste of every beer, and then go from there."
62,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good bar in Amsterdam, with many tap beers and typical amsterdamer food. Very big place,ideal for groups. If you love Beer, you should come here and taste a wide variety of craftbeer"

64,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 years ago,Local pub. Good beer and get the Bitter Ballen.
65,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great brewery in the center of Amsterdam! As a local this is the place I go when I'm in the touristic center and want to have a beer.
Tip: is it really full inside? Walk downstairs and ga around the corner, there's a second bar area there!"
66,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cool brewery tucked into an alley

71,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really good. Great atmosphere and nice staff.
They were missing some of the beer from the menu, not a huge problem. It can happen. The wings weren't great and the cheese platter wasn't spectacular, but …"

74,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great beer in the heart of the RLD. I think the Prael Burger might be in the top ten of my list of burgers anywhere.  Absolutely delicious.  I would go back any time.  Highly recommended.
75,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,The most lively of Amsterdam's breweries. The food was just perfect!
76,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good beers & food in a good location. Really friendly staff and a good vibe. Have wifi.
77,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place to try out the (big) selection of Prael beers on tap. I liked how the place also had couches to chill on. One small remark was that we had to wait a very long time before being served. I walked to the bar and got in immediately. …
78,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,7 months ago,Amazing Craft Beers brewed with a really special attitude regarding the employees and the spirit. Million times better than global player breweries
79,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Decent brewery, nothing spectacular. Three stars just because staff is extremely unfriendly. Good ambiance, though."
80,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good beer, great food. Everything was very tasty, no bland flavors anywhere in the food."
81,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice place super friendly staff and a great atmosphere, lots of seating and a view of the brewery tanks"
82,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,9 months ago,"We went there during our Bier-Stadswandeling route. We choose 2 among the different kind of beers available, and as a snack they gave a kind of ""cheese box"". Everything was very nice!! Check the picture 😉"
83,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very cosy place with great beer (order wheat wine which is apparently a type of beer despite its name). Recommended
84,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,We made the visit to the brewery that at the end included beer tasting at the bar. It was interesting and very fun. Reasonable price.
85,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious beer in a great setting. They have a nice selection of beer in many styles, and the ones I tried were great."

Perfect to sit and chat with friends in a fun, quirky environment. …"
89,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great beers and you can do a taster selection that comes with peanuts and a glass of water. Pretty decent food as well. Nice bar.
90,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Definitely worth of visiting - tasty food, decent selection of beers and friendly efficient service. Beef burger was ridiculously yummy and the veggie option - seaweed patty was equally tasty. 10 euros for tasting board of four different …"
91,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very local and great beers. The bitterballen are really good too.
92,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,a year ago,"The concept is great. The beer selection is basic. An awesome set up, some good snacks and it is created the formula to spend the rest of a walking day in Amsterdam and wait for the night activities of the city to start. I know you need a place to sit before heading to the Red light district, then you found it!"
93,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty beers with that distinctive lowland flavour, friendly staff, and the tunes weren’t bad either. Also, you can smell the maltiness from the in-house brewery so you know this is for real. Very nice indeed!"
94,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What an incredible place. Hidden in an alley downtown, this microbrewery has the best home-made beer in town. At least out of the few I tried. They have a good selection of home brewed beer. from dark Porter to bitter blonde, almost all of …"
95,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to drink a few Prael biertjes. They offer a nice selection, not everything the main location has I think but still a good selection. Something for everyone. Had the Prael burger here and it was truly amazing! One of the best burgers I've had in quite some time. Can definitely recommend!"
96,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a really good brewery tour. The staff were lively and informative and the beer was excellent.  The tour was great value and our guide was approachable and very friendly.  Well recommended.  The beer at the end was very tasty too!
97,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, good beer, nice atmosphere. We enjoyed the late evening drinks with a group of colleagues, perfect for such occasion. I also liked the concept of assisting integration of people with various handicaps."
98,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome brewery, excellent beer, killer ambiance and perfect location. Great brewery culture going on in Amsterdam and this place is a must stop for beer lovers."

100,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 months ago,Love it! Good beers and great ambience
101,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The whole place stinks of old fish. It's a very busy place a day such as this, the day after King's Day. Service is still fast despite this though. But as mentioned, the stench of old fish is hard to get over. …"
102,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent atmosphere and beers. Perfect to visit with friends or after work.
103,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good beers and nice staff! We recommend the warm mix platter that goes well with the beers!
104,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice selection of beers, cool place."
105,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The fried fish was amazing. The potatoe salad not so much, but I think that's personal preference. The beer is nice as well. For Amsterdam centre they have reasonable prices. …"
106,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 months ago,Black beer was amazing; Highly recommended.
107,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice atmosphere. Prices are good. We did not get to try the food because we came in after 23:00. The beer selection is really good and there is something for everyone. There is plenty of seating inside and some outside.
108,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,Local brewery located in a windmill.  Great beer selection and friendly staff. Fun atmosphere.
109,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 months ago,"No nonsense, cool place to drink a good beer"
110,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great variety of beers at a laid back environment! The IPAs are definitely something special! Can get busy from Friday, but if you have a beer at the bar/outside you will eventually get seats."
111,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I like it, pub is located in one little street out of tourists corners but its very crowded and loud, count with needed reservations. One of the waiters wasnt kindly but another was kindly, so it was uncomfortable for us.
Beer was fantastic, Liquid beacon ?!"
112,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Some of the best craft beer that I've had in Amsterdam.  Liked the bitter and bitter blonde.  Got the cheese plate and assorted fried platter, both of which were tasty. Got to taste some fried Dutch sausage, some kind of breaded ball with …"
113,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great beer, great food, nice atmosphere. It's hidden gem in the middle of red light district."
114,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Its a good place for drink good beers, enjoy with friends."
115,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great busy brewery bar in the heart of the Red Light District. always busy, the beer and food are great and reasonably priced for the area. So much better than the local Heineken / Amstel bars and rotates their own beer across the taps according to what's fresh."
116,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great beer, good seating. Sometimes gets a bit loud for conversation, but you're going to a brewery after all. I live in the area, so it's a good place to get a really nice beer and some bar snacks (borrel). When the couches upstairs are open, those are the best seats!"
117,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff, tasty beer, fair price for original beer. Good place to talk, meet friends, enjoy beer"
118,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best word to describe this micro brewery is blijde. It is peaceful, easy to find and all the staff are very friendly. There are several specialist beers to try and the bar snacks are delicious. Try the beer balls. Best time to go is shortly after lunch. Thank you  Brouwerij team for great service."
119,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,A very spacious bar with room for groups or more intimate company. A great range of their own beers with flights available to try a range. The flights are well thought out with Nibbles and water to help clear your palette. …
120,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,3 years ago,Beer was fine though limited in range. They had a few guest beers but mainly concentrated on their own brews. I imagine the split level bar with lots of stairs to the main drinking area could cause some amusement on busy nights!
121,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,8 months ago,"A awsome bar to eat,meet and work.
The beers are nice and awsome staff that gives u a family like feeling."
122,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is a must visit for craft beer lovers.  The selections are delicious. The brewery also has the coolest story: the owners are supporters of integrating people with mental illnesses into society. Come to support their mission too while enjoying truly artistic beer! Proost!
123,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 1 star ,2 years ago,"Stay away if you're searching for a good brewpub. I went to this place hoping that it would be a bar for beer-lovers to appreciate the beers from the brewery, but I couldn't be more mistaken. The service is terrible: I ordered one of the …"
124,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Brewery! Snack, Burgers & Beer! Nice vibe"
125,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Don't go if you want to have a quick beer. Basically because service is going to take a while in serving you BUT, beyond that, they have a really cool environment, really nice artisanal beers, a lot of options with food to eat or just have …"
126,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 2 stars ,2 years ago,I made a reservation for dinner in this place last Saturday. Everything went well until we decided to order. Our surprise was big when they said that they run out of food. Nothing was available except snacks. We didn't believe it due …
127,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice brewery! They serve good food as well. The smell was quite uncomfortable when I was here, but I assume (and heard from others who've been there more often) that this is a temporary issue. It's very cosy, and definitely better than the 'standard' places in the area!"
128,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,4 years ago,Lil bit over priced....good beer....good location....
129,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, great beer, super atmosphere and amazing staff. Tip well!"
130,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 2 stars ,a year ago,"Although the place has its atmosphere, good choice of beer and decent food, service spoils it all... The staff is mean, unprofessional and does not keep the place tidy. It's a disaster even for a center of Amsterdam. We definitely won't come back."
131,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,a year ago,"Employees are TOP notch. Beers were decent too but I have an uncooperative pallet, my fault, not theirs. Loved their vibe and willingness to help and discuss."
132,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place was great.  I had the barley wine, seriously some of the best beer I have ever drank. I got there just in time, about 430 to avoid the big dinner push. Had a great corner table overlooking the restaurant. Ordered a wonderful …"
133,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,2 years ago,The service is quite bad. Only a few people for a huge place. The beer is good and the place well-decorated.
134,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Most beers (not just the IPAs) seem to have a high IBU (international bitterness units) rating. I don’t appreciate the bitterness in other beers than IPAs, so I was a bit disappointed. The interior is like a living room, bar 3.0. Staff was nice and we were served quickly."
135,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,3 years ago,"When we visited this place it was half full. We stayed for a few beers and food which were both nice enough. The beer was a bit on the expensive side.
My main complaint would be the poor attentiveness of the staff. We had to …"
136,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to have a beer with friends, it is close to Amsterdam's main station. The place is on an alley if the weather allows I recommend taking a table outside but it is also nice inside, next to the building they have the actual …"
137,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Cozy establishment, good beers and tasty bar snacks. Several of the beers on tap are brewed in the brewery next door, the others are from various local breweries."
138,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lively place, good beers. As a local I find it too touristy. On the other hand: what do you expect when it's located close to central station and the red light district? If you like good beers, this is the place to be. Had some awesome IPA here!"
139,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great brewery well placed, yet hidden in the city center. The selection of beers is great with a lot of variety, and the food, although greasy, tastes very very good. The staff serving shows lack ok knowledge on the beers they are serving which is disappointing for beers fans."
140,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, excellent beer, Although it was busy.... service was fast and friendly.
We had some food, beef stew,veg and potatoes. It was very tasty and LARGE. But I would say it lacked style....more like school dinner fare."
141,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great ambience, plenty of beer. They have a few of their own beers and ales on tap, more bottled. Lots of people, but never feels overcrowded nor to noisy."
142,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,5 months ago,Excellent beers. Food is average.
143,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I came to this place specifically to try the beer. I was not dissapointed. The beer is really good. I liked the vintage decoration all over the place. The only thing, it was a bit noisy since this place is rather busy after work time. The food was rather average"
144,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very good place for craft beer. Five stars if you are in to Ales but as a lager and or Stout person this place falls short big time. They have a crazy amount of high quality low cost ales to choose from. That being said they don't serve a …
145,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"If there had been a terrace for the sunny days I would have given 5 stars.  The Wheat wine is excellent,  the waiters friendly and the food delicious.  Don't hold against the staff that they are people who have had difficulties with the job market,  they are doing a great job 😊"
146,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,This brewery right in the middle of Amsterdam’s downtown has a cool hipster vibe with old records and funky decor. The beer is quite good and there are about 8 varieties on tap. The space is fairly large so there’s always somewhere to hang …
147,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,Cool place with a great atmosphere and good beer.   Loud but a trendy fun crowd.
148,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very good beer options and a nice bar. A bit slow with the service at the tables, it's better to get drinks by yourself, but table service does not seem to be the idea here. Nice french fries, but I hope to come back soon to try some of their dishes."
149,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,6 months ago,My favorite place for a tripel in Amsterdam
150,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great brewery right in the city centre, tucked away from the craziness of the red light district. They brew awesome beers, now also serving beer cocktails. Food and staff are also very good. Sunday afternoon you find live jazz."
151,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome selection of beers here. Very cozy atmosphere and great comfort bar food. We had a large group, which they accommodated easily, and we all enjoyed the evening."
152,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The visiting is so explicative and very effective. Our ""beer guide"" was so funny! At the end of the visiting, we had the chance to try and taste many kind of beers, so good! Recommend, if you have time!"

154,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The red light district has hidden gems here and there, some hidden in plain sight, and some like De Prael hidden in small alleys.
Definitely worth a visit, not just for their very good beer, but even more for …"
155,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,5 years ago,"We came here for my birthday, which it was very complicated to find a place for 10 people in Amsterdam.
The service was fine, the food: better than expected, and their beers are good! …"
156,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place is awesome. Really good atmosphere, great beer and great food too. Best place during my visit to Amsterdam"
157,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cool location. Every beer tastes excellent. For those who loves to drink beer this place is a highlight.
158,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very good tour of the brouwerij. Really good concept of business idée!!

Too bad they don't deliver to Sweden!"
159,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very lively bar, good beers and food!"
160,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is awesome!! On the edge of the red lighthouse district, you’ll be pleased you’ve left the stags and stoners for this place. Lovely beer, traditional Dutch ‘gin’, eclectic decor and great service. It’s also massive!! Don’t waste your time in a grim bar, go here."
161,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,I had the burger and my wife had the prom belly. Both were excellent. One of the best burgers I've had here. The beers were really good also. Some bigger IPAs which I enjoyed. …
162,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Smelled a little weird inside, food selection isn't huge but ok. The flammkuchen was great. Interior ok, selection of beer was good, the tap beers always change which is kind of cool. …"
163,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was one of my favorite places and we found it by pure coincidence. Socially conscious, delicious beer and food, open and helpful staff, great playlist. We didn't know we would stay for the rest of the evening."
164,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 1 star ,4 years ago,"Although the beer was good, I don't wanna give this place a good rating. We came to eat, picked up a menu at the bar ourselves (while others got it delivered to their table) and we waited one hour(!) for the waiter to come to our table and …"
165,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,4 years ago,There you can test different beers in small cups. Personal was very friendly. Just I think they have to identify the bears better in case the custom want to drink this again. Very good price !
166,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great industrial bar conversion. Huge LED screen, stage and Line Array sound. Beer a bit ordinary and odd some tasting (not craft), had good Ribs. People very friendly and welcoming"
167,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,a year ago,"In the middle of all the hustle and bustle of the city center, this place is indeed an oasis for some great beers. Check out the monthly bingo night for some fun evening"
168,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great atmosphere, good vibes. Quite some special draft beers on tap. Can have some tasters as a set as well. Will come back for sure!"
169,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, lots of space inside and outside. Nice service. Beer is only average, the beer tasting option for 11 Euro is very popular with the guests, but in my view overrated and overpriced."
170,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,4 years ago,Visited after a friend recommended. We had beer and snacks (bitterballen and cheese soufle) and everything was very tasty. The only disappointment was the staff that ignored us completely - we walked around for quite a while looking for a …
171,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A fantastic place to go, take friends, visitors, or make friends. A beer menu that changes regularly can bring to light types you've never tried before.
Tasting flights are very popular and all drinks are normally served at the half-pint so you can chop and change at will"
172,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very interesting place. Good beer, moderate prices. Well, the only beer that I don't like is the one with limonchelli.. Apparently, mixing the twin things is bad. Have some patience in advance as some of the personal here has  mental disabilities, so,...help them!! And enjoy"
173,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, good crafted beer. Have to ask for a pint to get one, otherwise glasses. Friendly servers. Upstairs / main floor nice, downstairs was just a suberranean spot with tables. Would go to again."
174,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Despite it being very busy and so central, which means full of obnoxious tourists, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the staff kept their cool and friendliness. The beer selection is alright, the prices are fair and the food is good. I'd go here again with friends."
175,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,9 months ago,Fabulous Beer! Fun and friendly staff. MUST go to stop in Amsterdam.  Say hi to Ruud!
176,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 1 star ,2 years ago,"For the love of God, rinse your glasses before pouring me a beer. I could still see suds on the side of the glass when she handed me a pint. Soap ruins the flavor of beer. We asked for a clean glass after this, the response, ""There's nothing wrong with a soapy glass, this is how we do it."""
177,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great beers. Some American influence in the styles they brew but also rooted in many European traditions and styles. Went twice during our stay in Amsterdam and loved almost every beer we had.
178,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,2 years ago,Pricey but their beers are much better than Budweiser or Heineken. The milk stout is full of flavour and the IPA has just enough hope to make it interesting.
179,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 1 star ,3 years ago,"We waited over 1 hour for our food on a not so crowded time. Each burger was over 17 euros and it's not worth it! Some had no bacon, some salads had no dressing.... would not recommend for food."
180,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,This is one of the hidden gems of Amsterdam. They have a limited number of beers on tap but it's Amsterdam brewed and tastes real good. They also have some events such as Bingo nights which are quite fun. …
181,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The place is quite hidden, so it's not easy to run into it, however the selection of homemade beers is quite ample and the kitchen is pretty good so as the service. It's a bit expensive but you have always to consider that you are in the city center, so it's anyway difficult to find something cheaper around..."
182,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"An absolute must visit for beer lovers in Amsterdam. Incredible selection of their own brews, all delicious. Often they are happy to show you the brewery if you're with a tour or ask."
183,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,3 years ago,Reasonably interesting brewery tour but fraught with dangerously steep steps and slippy surfaces throughout the tour. Be careful.  The shop was more  fascinating than the brewery for me.  Free beer in their pub at te end.
184,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The must visit brewery of the old City of Amsterdam.
Always very busy but they take reservations as well, so either make one or pop in and be a little patient. …"
185,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,6 years ago,A great social program that provides people with social and mental challengers a place to work. A Non-profit brewery what a wonderful idea. They have a large area good for groups and an ever changing range of beers that is made on location. Definitely worth a visit.
186,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fun little brewpub with a solid beer selection and nice food menu. I didn't get to try any of the food, but it looked good at other tables. The beers that I had were all good."
187,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A brewery in the center of Amsterdam where you can try some nice beers and still have a nice talk. There is a bingo happening upstairs on some days, but the place is still big enough to be unaware of what's happening. You should try the beer tasting, it's a nice one to start :)"
188,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The bier selection was great we tried several different varieties. All priced around 3-4 euro's. We had the bitterballen and Special schnitzel, the bitterballen lacked meat,  and didn't have much flavor. The schnitzel on the other-hand was very good."
189,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really? The boss is a nice guy. The bartenders are cool. The beers are amasing. People there were fun.
Comon and let get a real fresh glass …"

191,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good tasty food.. and local brewed very nice beers.
192,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I had drinks outside which does not have potential to make it better as it is on a lane, however, if you like beer than what are you waiting for??? Best beer I have ever had. Milkstout and Triple blew my mind 🍻🍺. If you have time for a drink give this place a go"
193,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very friendly place. Nice beers and food. I think it is a local place rather then trustic.
194,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nacho was ok.. big advantage is location, very close to Centraal Station."
195,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing beers, excellent bar food. Make sure to make a reservation if you want to go there with more than 4 people."
196,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Very busy, very interesting brewery. I tried a few of the beers and felt they were very strong, ideal for my tastes. The food was very good and the decor was not bad at all. I would definitely go back."
197,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Now o live this place, the pale ales melt your marbles, its busy but cosy at the same time..... Now showing my age but.... I remember when... Oh oh here we go! They used to do great food and live jazz every Sunday... The jazz doesn't happen …"
198,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,Somehow managed to forget my food order twice so had to wait around 90 minutes from ordering. However when it did arrive I was told it was free of charge & I got a couple of complementary beers as well!! Food & beer both very good & staff very pleasant.
199,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice beers, nice staff, nice vibe. I didn't eat but those that did enjoyed their snacks. Only reason against 5 stars is no killer beer that I had to come back for."
200,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful place, very good selection of beers and well served. Definitely a must in Amsterdam, and I think there are no so much places with this vibe in here. And reasonably prices also!"
201,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice brewpub-restaurant in a great location, a good selection of their own beers on tap, and the food is good as well. The downside is that it is almost always crowded."
202,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good selection of beers, right in the city center. But the service was pretty bad."
203,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,Must-visit brewpub in the heart of Amsterdam. Great atmosphere and ditto beer. Mind you: staff consists of people with a 'distance to regular jobs' so sometimes communications can be challenging - but it is really worth it!
204,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 1 star ,2 years ago,Waiter guy could not remember the name of two beers and two burgers. We ended up waiting more than an hour for the burgers because he did not even order them at the kitchen. As an apology another waiter guy offered the drinks for free. At the end the 3rd waiter guy still made us pay for everything.
205,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,6 years ago,A hidden gem! They serve an excellent selection of locally brewed beers for great prices. The ambiance was very relaxed with live jazz band at that time.
206,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was excellent, and the beer was even better. Ambient of the place was quite nice. Overall the restaurant was great. We had the burger as well as the trout filet which was served with tagliatelle, and I would recommend you try them both!"
207,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Pub has a nice atmosphere, but our food (we tried several dishes) was absolutely atrocious - worse even than UK/English pubs! Bartenders were also extremely grumpy."
208,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice hangout to try some good and worth the money craft beer after a long sightseeing tour in Amsterdam :)
209,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best breweries in Amsterdam (in fact is the third in Trip Advisor Top 10). It's highly recommendable for visiting. Don't miss trying Bierbitterballen
210,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great selection of beers to suit all tastes, paired well with meat and cheese options. The patio is a perfect place to spend a sunny afternoon."
211,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice wee pub. Good beer, mostly Belgian styles. Recommend one of the flight boards so you can sample a selection. Didn't try the food."
212,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Best brewery in Amsterdam if you look at the overall experience. (Same owner as the IJ brewery anyway so who cares, they are all connected). Interior is excellent; stylish yet a pub feel to it and enough space not to cringe despite the top …"
213,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place, great beers ! Services was a bit slow at first ar but the waiter make an effort after noticing. Now one of my favorite brewery !"
214,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It's a good brewery perfectly set in a narrow alley near the red lights. It was a short walk to Spoor 15, managed to catch the train to Schipol with no issue. I liked their Mossels cooked in beer. And of course the beers."
215,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very nice place! Beer is amazing and service kind. There's lot of space inside, so there's commonly no problem in finding a table for enjoying a beer with friends."
216,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good location, lot of space and really nice and inexpensive beer"
217,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,5 years ago,Reasonable beer selection but my lord stay away from the klasekier bitter. Staff were less friendly than you'd normally want but nothing too offensive. Plenty of space to hide away from a quiet couple
218,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I am a very easy going person but this place had an awful service, pretty OK food and average beer. …"
219,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Beer was good and average priced for the area, but was completely packed when I visited. Good place to go with a group that wants to do a lot of drinking then leave, not a good place if you want to sit a while and converse."
220,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great beer, much less touristy than the surroundings"
221,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great beers, Greta staff. Thank you!"
222,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good beer from on site brewery, beer a little expensive though. I had a good IPA. For better value you can buy takeaway beer in bottles at their retail outlet around the corner on the canal."
223,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great beer, nice relaxing music on a rainy day. Seems like a typical Amsterdam pub....Oh, yes also good food."
224,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Oh, the beer here is amazing. Several custom brews on rotating selection. Be warned - the food portions are *tiny*, so get at least two entrees."
225,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This brewery is one of the MUST GO's in Amsterdam, the beer is great with a lot of variety. The food is awesome also, be it snacks or entire plates, they are all very tasty."
226,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely place, decent beer selection for Amsterdam and okay prices. Their snacks were pretty good too. Service was a bit slow sometimes, but always very friendly."
227,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Good local beer with their brewing tank right next door. Noisy happy sort of place, suitable for large groups. Burgers are amazing too!"
228,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice brewery in the center or Amsterdam, lovely decoration and a variety of their own beers. We had bitterballen with it and it tasted good. Thiebaud couldn't find this review though."
229,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 1 star ,3 years ago,"Beer was nice, wanted to try the food but after we received our beer no waiter or waitress ever returned to take our order. I hope all the staff are ok and don't require a missing persons report."
230,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great beer and the service is ok. I was expecting to learn something about dutch beers and differences between the types,
or at least some explanation, but that was not the case. They just serve the beer. Even so, it was a good experience."
231,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Service is quirky and erratic with people with disabilities or difficult pasts, but it adds to the charm of the place. One of Amsterdams original craft breweries, though not necessarily the best. Atmosphere is pretty good though."
232,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Genuinely cool place to get great beers in a relaxed atmosphere. Note it is a little far out of the centre of Amsterdam, best visited by bike or public transport"
233,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice place just few steps away from the touristic streets. Cozy and friendly but I would recommend not to eat here nor to sit downstairs because of the mice.
234,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I was in Amsterdam with a couple of other American Craft Beer aficionados, so naturally we looked for the local scene. …"
235,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very cool brewery near the canal. They have good beers and a great atmosphere. It is a very large space so it's good for groups of any size.
236,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It's one of my places in Amsterdam. Close to the station, with that weird retro decoration and a lot of self-made beers. Don't go expecting having a quick beer because it's a ""non stress area"" 😂😂😂 but I like, it's a part of the experience. I strongly recommend to go"
237,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great Brewery that carves out a bit of quiet in the middle of the insanity
238,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Tasting room/pub is around the corner. They have good tasting sets (4 small beers, a water, and some snack) and every beer I tried was excellent. Finally, part of Europe that can keep up with Oregon, Washington, and Victoria."
239,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place, they brew their own beer and it's amazing. They serve very generous meals"
240,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best breweries in Amsterdam. You can take a brewery tour during the day, and enjoy a beer in the bar anytime of day! Great location, great beers!"
241,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic beer. Social Enterprise. Unique old Dutch style living room corner. A gem amongst so much commercial garbage in that area.
242,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Tasty good beer, something to dinner, excellent atmosphere and friendly staff. The best place to runaway from the Red Light District's crowds."
243,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good choice of beer and the staff was very helpful. Food was good too. It was a good find amidst all the overly touristy places in the neighborhood.
244,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great, local brewery. All the beers available are brewed on site. The pale ale was the stand out for me. Loads of hops flavour, fantastic!"
245,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great amount of different beers, from tap of bottle. Cosy atmosphere, crowded in weekends with locals and tourists. Also good snacks and wines available."
246,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Have been coming here for years now, one of my favorite places in Amsterdam!"
247,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 3 stars ,a year ago,"Nice brew pub, the brewery is a bit hidden in the back but they serve nice brews and food"
248,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good beer, lots of tight spaces available to sitting, but you may have to look around on a busy day. Multiple bars are available but not all bars have the same selection of beer available."
249,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 1 star ,2 years ago,"The smell of chlorine in the air, every dirty Glass just dipped in chlorine solution then reused. Every flavor in the beer destroyed. Besides that staff look sad,..."
250,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really good beer! And the price is cheaper compared with other brewpubs in the town. The staff were nice. There are some board games.
251,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Spacious, yet cosy space. The beer is great and they offer an array of comfort food-style dishes."
252,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice place. Good beer!!! The only thing I noticed is that glasses are only washed into soapy water... never rinced in clear water afterwards... soap residue in my beer...?? Mmmmm
253,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great brewery in a little side street of the RLD. Great people working there and some delicious beers! You should do the brewery tour followed by a  tasting :)
Will go again"
254,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 2 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice beers and friendly staff but very slow service! Small portion of food and expensive! I found a full hair inside of my mushroom croquet!
255,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best brewery/bar in center of Amsterdam! Beer is good. Service is excellent every time I come. Thanks to waiters, especially to Ryan!"
256,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good local beers.  Fair prices, very pleasant atmosphere and good service.  Worth the visit!"
257,"Brouwerij ""De Prael""", 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Dont know why it is rated so well. Smells bad, service doesnt speak english in the center of tourism, the only that they do good is beer. But you can get that really anywhere else. 2 Stars. please clean and make sure it doesnt smell like old piss"
