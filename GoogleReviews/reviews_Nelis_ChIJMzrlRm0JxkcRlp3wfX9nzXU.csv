1,Nelis, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, very friendly waitress, bit expensive. One big mistake; we ordered a starter and explicitly requested it without meat and when the starter arrived there was meat on top of  1 dish...the solution of the chef was to just take off the meat from the top of the dish...... not very professional :-("

5,Nelis, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Supreme quality food and service! I ordered a fish dish with vegetables. Fresh and full of taste, really worth trying. Passion fruit ice cream is refreshing! Strongly recommend."
6,Nelis, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I don‚Äôt get the superhigh rating here. The food was good but not spectacular. The usual things were on the menu. Among others a cheesefondue, odd choice considering the cheese fondue restaurant a few doors down the street. Would‚Äôve given it a 4 star rating were it not for the loud dance music making it impossible to have a conversation."
