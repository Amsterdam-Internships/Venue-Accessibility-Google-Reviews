0,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,4 months ago,We had diner in this restaurant. The decoration is really nice and the waiters are very sympathetic. The food was good but not exceptional. Prices are not excessive. Good for friends or family gatherings
1,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 2 stars ,6 months ago,I saw that this place had a lot of reviews and had to try it out. We did takeaway and tbh im quite dissapointed. The price of the ribs is less then what you pay for at SpareRib Express but there is a reason. Its bland. The cheesecake was ‚Ä¶

4,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 months ago,If you're a carnivore or omnivore then this is your jam. I'm Tejano and their food is legit BBQ. Ribs fall off the bone. Corn on the cob is heaven. Drinks are artisinal. Staff are superb.
5,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Ordered carry out today. Mac and cheese was baked which was a pleasant surprise. Chicken was bland and simple. Was expecting more for the price to be honest.
6,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Doesn't look like much on the outside and when the restaurant is full it can take a while before your dinner gets served.
But apart from that the steak is really good. We had nachos as a starter which ‚Ä¶"

If you‚Äôre looking for spacious dining spot with chill vibes, this is the place for you."
10,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Limited menu to offer you amazing food done by the rules of meat and flavor. Best in class burgers, steak and spare ribs."

15,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 months ago,With a quick ferry ride from central station it‚Äôs perfect to escape the hectic city center. The burgers are out of this world here and all the food passing by our table was looking great to. Friendly personnel with quick service.
16,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place for meat lovers! Very pleasant staff and a nice and relaxed atmosphere. The steaks are awesome. Perfectly cooked (flame grilled) and very juicy. There is sufficient parking space just outside of the building. What a great find! Can defenitally recommend it.
17,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,Good hamburger and good product‚Ä¶. Sad the service ‚Ä¶. Not really friendly‚Ä¶ they looks are there just to get a salary and go home ‚Ä¶. 20 minutes for an hamburger with the empty restaurant and the burger was cold ‚Ä¶..
18,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great ribs, delicious burger and tasty beers. The atmosphere is cozy. The wait staff is attentive, but the restaurant is very busy so you may wait sometimes. This location is fun if you take the free ferry from central station. We recommend it."

22,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"One of the many Cannibale Royale locations. Its very big inside, and very well decorated. Food is delicious, at reasonable prices. Surprisingly they make amazing cocktails too...i recommend the espresso martini before lunch to get you going. Ribs are a favourite as well."
23,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Interesting venue in NDSM. Space is unique, staff young and energetic. Menu is Interesting, priced above average, but portions are generous and quality is very good. Gets packed after 18:00, so reserve ahead or go early."
24,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The restaurant itself is very big and rustic. The atmosphere is also very lively. However, the choice is quite limited. We went there as one meat eater and one vegetarian. The food was quite good but it took a long time to come. The waiters ‚Ä¶"
25,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic food at a reasonable price. Was super impressed. The Le Classique burger is amazing. I recommend Kees Hazy Sunrise to go with it, it's a New England IPA. The Le Magnifique was a bit too dry, the only thing that wasn't superb. We ‚Ä¶"
26,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Been there for early New Years dinner (before the crazy hours) and it was honestly one of the best decisions to do, complementary champagne by very helpful staff. The Dutch balls were Devine ;) and the ribs were mouth watering (the lamb was ‚Ä¶"
27,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, nice atmosphere. Burgers are very good too, as are the ribs. Service was good although one of my coworkers asked for a Coke 5 times, but never got it while we were served beer in under 5 minutes each time we ordered it.. If you like meat, this is your place..."
28,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to eat and have drinks. Friendly staff as well. You can hoop the free ferry from Amsterdam centraal to get here. Ribs are fantastic and the Mac n' cheese is amazing.
29,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Awesome atmosphere and most importantly the meat is excellent. The ribs were so tender that the meat falls off when you pick it up by the bone. üòç
30,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place! A perfect meal for 2. Watch out with the side dishes, the burgers are a lot already!"
31,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It was amazing, but we where there for lunch, so the meat menu was limited, the burger I had was very nice, could be nicer if it was Medium rare, my wife had the cheese steak sandwich, which was awesome, the fries was oke,"
32,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place but...
I don‚Äôt know how about stakes but hamburger was a disaster. Tomato chopped probably with hatchet as it was more quarter than a slice, fell out before eating ‚Ä¶"
33,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Do you love good and not overpriced meat?If you do then you will love this restaurant,the roasted vegetables is also a must even if you are not a fan because they taste similar to meat,the service is great and the staff willing to help,the space is comfortable with dim lighting,it‚Äôs a plus on everything,good job!"
34,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Great comfort food but it was lukewarm on arrival and not hot as it should be. The salad was fine but lacked some saltiness normally anjovis. The chicken wings and beer were great! As was the overall look and feel of the place.
35,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, lovely staff. We arrived as the kitchen was closing but they still served us. The dishes look and taste amazing!"
36,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Place was nice, loved the rough and raw vibe it gave off. The music was a bit too loud for my preference. I did notice they serve the dishes with a lot of salt, my table was under the salt after finishing our meal. We had the mac n cheese ‚Ä¶"
37,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Service was a bit slow that day. Food was good.
38,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The staff is really friendly and helpfu.
They serve good cocktails, my advice try the Spicy Mai Kai and the
L' Absurd Steak rare (1000gram) you will not be disappointed!"
39,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The l'Exceptionelle is literally exceptional. Don't let the 600gr scare you off....it's enough ;) (but really not too much). Perfect quality
40,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Cosy restaurant, there's quite a bit of fat on the steaks, but the taste is good. Friendly service too!"
41,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice, warm and cosy interior. Had their special burger with 180g Angus and with duck liver. It was not the best burger I've had but definitely worth the visit for its price and the experience. Fries were Okey but were missing something: ‚Ä¶"
42,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Steak was nice. Price is reasonable. And the flair is unique.
Service mixed up our orders. So we had to issue the rare/doneness by ourselfes. ‚Ä¶"
43,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food for a decent price. It's certainly very hipster and crowded, so expect a pretty long wait for your food to arrive. Good selection of local beers. The meat is top notch and the burgers are awesome!"
44,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best spare ribs I ever had: tasty yet kinda light, juicy yet not that fat. The burgers are interesting to say the least, while there's a wide beer selection. Considerably more spacious than the rest!"
45,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Food is absolutely delicious and staff was super friendly and helpful. Definitely worths a visit if you are in the area.
46,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The Cannibale Royale Du Nord is already the fifth branch of this popular restaurant in Amsterdam, now in the NDSM wharf area. Easy to reach by free ferry from Amsterdam Central Station, take the one marked NDSM. ‚Ä¶"

48,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Super restaurant. Super staff; the lady wearing the pink top was very nice!
49,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"The staff was really polite. The food was good as well, but not yet worthy of 5 stars."

52,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent steaks, excellent burgers (with a rotating cast of specials), well-meaning and friendly staff, cool decor and regular DJ sets mainly at the weekends. This place is all about the meat however, so stay clear of the corn and broccoli - ‚Ä¶"
53,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Lovely spacious atmosphere with excellent service, even for a busy Friday night. Food was nice, burger and pork was delio, ribs are a little on the dry side. Topped of with a delicious ice cream sundae, oh man I am stuffed!"
54,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was great, I had the classique burger and it was amazing. It was a bit busy so it took a bit longer than was anticipated but other than that the experience was very nice."
55,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,a year ago,I've visited with some friends. I was literally savouring the steak that I took. It was cooked really good and delicious. Sweet potato fries and mac 'N' cheese where also good. My friend's took burgers and spareribs which were literally ‚Ä¶
56,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Last minute dinner was good. Ribeye slightly tough but seasoned perfectly.
57,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 3 stars ,7 months ago,It's okay. Nothing spectacular. On the pricy side. The (only?( vegetarian option was a burger which was actually not bad at all. The meat dishes were okay according to my dinner party.
58,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Crowded but nice place and dogs are not an issue! Hardly have seen that efficient service. Go for the ribs and you won‚Äôt regret it
59,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great meat and an OK selection of drinks. The brisket was kinda chewy though.
60,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"The staff was really kind, the veggie burger was so good that it tasted like a premium non-vegetarian one. The chicken one was impressive as well."

64,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 1 star ,4 months ago,The place says its fully booked while half empty. I could even book a table online. Customer care at its worst
65,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Outstanding food!! Service was amazing thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
66,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Just had the starters those were delicious. Definatly will try the steak next time. Great location. Also good for bigger groups.

75,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,a month ago,Great vibe and the best spare ribs in town!
76,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Apparently overloaded and understaffed, do not expect any semblance of a normal service on peak hours. Also beware of their online order system, they cannot cancel and refund a wrong order - all refunds are cash only at restaurant."
77,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great place, good food... I would surely go again"
78,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Outstanding spot, brilliant for groups and meat lovers! The spot is very modern with an industrial butchery feeling. The food is really tasty, I would try more than one dish every time I'm there. It's always a place to go back to for a casual but still quite nice dinner night out in the Noord."
79,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"First experience, ordered the Burger Cannibale Royale, on the first attempt- got a cold patty, waiter got me a new one and apologized for the incident. Bread - low quality(probably due to food cost decision) gets soggy immediately and ‚Ä¶"

82,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely staff and great food, recommend the whole jerk chicken!"
83,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Food was not bad but wasn't worth the travel. Wine was not good at all. There are several car parks around to use, free after 19:00. The restaurant was not careful about the corona rules other than hand sanitizers. The service was not only slow but also one of the worst I experienced in Amsterdam."
84,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We had some nachos (full of taste and really filling),  a burger and some ribs (the meat was fantastically soft, however the taste of the glaze was maybe a bit too strong). Overall, the food was of superb quality, the atmosphere - cozy and ‚Ä¶"
85,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best baby back ribs of Amsterdam, but also one of the best burgers, and overall very nice and cozy (and full!) place to go. The Noord address is a bit out of the way, but also easier to book a table at. Highly recommended, and kids-friendly"
86,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Ribs are heaven trust me ü§§.. The other dishes are of course also super nice!
87,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Nice design restaurant. With good food BUT really (bad) unprofessional personeel and really annoying music..
88,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quirky place, great steak, great service. Short free ferry journey away from central station, just make sure you get the right ferry back!"
89,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"In short : amazing meat!  But to do it justice, I'd have to say, some of the best ribs I've had. The atmosphere is very nice, not too crazy but definitely not boring. Bbq sauce is fantastic,  complimented the meat seasoning perfectly. Also ‚Ä¶"

91,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 2 stars ,a year ago,Good food but service really not ok!we wait long to be served and wasn't so busy! I ask a side dish and arrive after 15 min that we was eating! Also Wrong drink! I need ask for my sweet patoto and for more than 10 minutes no body was there for help! The food we loved but your front crew are quiete distracted from any think!
92,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food good beer but beware the Mac & Cheese, spicy is an understatement especially when you're not expecting it!"
93,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 2 stars ,a year ago,"We went to this branch and ordered take away burgers and fries, there were just a few people outside with us, waiting for their orders. After all got theirs we waited like 1hour and went inside to ask what happened to our order and it was ‚Ä¶"
94,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,7 months ago,One of my favorite restaurants in Amsterdam. Unfortunately the grilled vegetables are off the menu now. Quite sad
95,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best steak I‚Äôve had in Amsterdam Nord!!! Nice atmosphere, friendly staff butttttt... busy as hell! If you want to find a place you need to reserve a table in advance. Enjoy :))"
96,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went late last night after a long day of flight delays from Spain. My aunt and I were so pleased with the food. We had ribs, steak and sides. The cocktails were great too. Plus didn't catch her name, but the fellow foodie that was serving us gave us a whole recommendation list, I cannot wait to try some out!"
97,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Of the best places in Amsterdam. Love the steaks here
98,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really liked this place.

99,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food. Very friendly staff. First time at this location, been to other Cannibale Royale locations as well. Absolutely love it. If you love meat, look no further and check this place out, you won't regret it."

102,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of my favorite restaurants in Amsterdam. Great choice of meals and a special atmosphere. Can be quite busy on the Friday evenings. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Also a great assortment of beers!
103,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The place and atmosphere is nice. Ribs were not so good. Steak and burger were delicious but portion of fries could be bigger. Overall was OK. Service was disappointing.
104,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place,super food,normal prices.Garlic bred was amazing!"

107,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is great! Situated at the NDSM terrain, you can get there from Central Station in just 15 minutes by ferry. The food is tasty, the service is exceptional and the seatings are comfortable. We were with a party of 8 and all of us had an outstanding food experience!"
108,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great food, especially the ribs! Diverse menu with something for everyone."
109,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Proper steaks, in various shapes and sizes. Burgers are also recommended and, contrary to what the name would suggest, also very decent vegetarian options. Nice selection of beers."
110,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We've hit a few restaurants around NDSM and this one defenitely had the best value for money. Good portions and a nice selection of international beers. The meat was excellent!

112,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The burger was okay.
The side dishes are okay. ‚Ä¶"
113,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great burger. Really juicy with a delicious soft bun. Mac and cheese side was also good, really cheesy but maybe a bit too much together. Friendly, quick service and cool interior."
114,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great food with some awesome beer served by kind staff
115,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I was eating here for two times by now. First time I ate a burger. Nothing too special, but Samuel L Jackson would still call it a tasty burger. The second time I ordered a steak medium cooked and it looked like a scene from a 80's slasher movie. Not that great :/"
116,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious steaks, prices for drinks are bit too high. It was a bit too warm inside on Friday evening. Overall good place, recommended. Cheesecake was nice too!"

121,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious burgers and ribs. Was there with a big group and they handled it all perfect. Staff was friendly and attentive. Quick service. Definitely coming back!
122,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The location is really nice and well located. The food but rather basic without surprises on the menu. I can not say that I'm a fan of this event catering. However, the ribs are really recommendable!"
123,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,2 years ago,When u compare price/taste it was ok. We order steam with our friends. We ask for mediuem however we get medium rare but because of the meat quality it was good
124,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely steaks and a great ambient a bit further away from all the crowds! Have been visiting this place kind of bi-monthly for 2 years. Try the cheesecake as well as a bonus.
125,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Decent meat but some of the slowest service ever... I know good steak takes time but it doesn't help if they let you sit 30 mins without even a drink order to start.
126,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Awesome food and great vibe with my kinda music :)
127,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place was very atmospheric. The meal was very tasty and service was prompt. The restaurant is situated across the water from Amsterdam Central Station.. There are ferries to link. They run every half hour. Head for Nswd. You will ‚Ä¶
128,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"If you love meat, this is the place to eat!"
129,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Noisier than the other Cannibale Royale locations, but the food is the usual great stuff! The staff is really nice and attentive, and the prices can be affordable, if you can contain yourself looking at the tables around you before ordering"
130,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice food! And better prices than a lot of other restaurants in the area. I liked the atmosphere and the service was very friendly :) definitely recommend this place!
131,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Tasty food!!! The pulled rib burger is a winner :)
132,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good spareribs, although regretfully on the dry side. Duck rillette was very nice. Propper beer choice too. Sauerkrautburger was not my thing but my wife liked it. Sweet potatowedges pretty soft, not crispy at all. Music a bit loud and not fitting.  Partymusic style... but I guess that is very subjective."
133,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cannibal royal IS one of the best restaurant in town for sure. But this spot up north is the best. Especially cause you don't have to queue up to long for a seat. Which make a huge difference in Amsterdam
134,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ribs are perfect as usual, didn't try the other things on the menu. Strange how they offer sweet potato fries for dinner but not earlier..."
135,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service is really slow and even after ordering it took drinks over half an hour to arrive, if they did at all (we asked several times). Food was decent."
136,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Top nice great place
Very good food ,very comfortable prices .all famile 7 people we paid 200‚Ç¨ !!!! With drinks and starters . ‚Ä¶"
137,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice selection of beers, the food is ok. The place is a bit expensive for what it is. We got served by waiters who don't serve but hand the plates and glasses to you instead of putting it on the table in front of you. Overall a mediocre experience."
138,Cannibale Royale du Nord, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Not amazed with my visit there. The burgers were nice and delicious. Service is not so nice. Everything we ordered came to the table wrong. I would not suggest this place
