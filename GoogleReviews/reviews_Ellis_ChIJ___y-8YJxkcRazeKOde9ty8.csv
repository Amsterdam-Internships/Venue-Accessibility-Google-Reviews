0,Ellis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It was a bit quite when we went in, but don‚Äôt let that fool you if it‚Äôs ever the case! After a little while the place was cozily busy. Rightfully so! The burgers (and nachos) were lovely, as was the staff. I would definitely recommend this place if you‚Äôre around and in the need of a good burger."
1,Ellis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice cozy place which serves very tasty burgers! The staff is friendly and you are served pretty quickly. They have a good selection of burgers and other goodies. The best thing is you can even get a gluten-free bun for no additional cost. ‚Ä¶
2,Ellis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice place. One of my favourite burger joints whole visiting Amsterdam. Reasonably priced and good quality food. 40euros for 2 burgers and 2 drinks
3,Ellis, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The Service was quite good but the burgers we ordered were small for the price we paid for. The classic burger was okay but a bit too cold. The Portobello burger says ""grilled vegetables"" but it had almost no vegetables on it. The Burger ‚Ä¶"
4,Ellis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had a very nice experience! The staff were really nice and were kind to switch the buns for iceberg lettuce (making it Keto friendly). Would highly recommend if looking for a keto friendly place in Amsterdam.
5,Ellis, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Ellis Gourmet Burger - Today (15.03.2018)  I would give 6 stars as the burgers were free, but even if you have to pay for them, they are worth it. They are really one of the best in Amsterdam. Supertasty and the bread is perfect as well as ‚Ä¶"
6,Ellis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The taste was okay. Unfortunately, when we got the food the burger was already cold. The service was friendly and gave us some tips for the city."
7,Ellis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The only disappointing thing about this place is the fact that there was nobody else eating here! The food was fantastic; fresh, quirky and well cooked, and the service was excellent. ‚Ä¶"
8,Ellis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Yesterday in the afternoon we had some burgers me and my family. We had a amazing service even tho it was very busy. ‚Ä¶
9,Ellis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really cosy. Has an actual fireplace. Great food and friendly staff. No problems at all.
10,Ellis, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Place looked really good and thought it may be a good company as they have restaurants across Europe but never been so annoyed with a place. Very well done out, cool newspaper style menus and serving staff were great. But 45 minutes after ‚Ä¶"
11,Ellis, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great burgers at a reasonble price. Especially love the fact that they have Belgian special beers at a normal price point (as in not overly priced for tourists), almost the same as if you were buying them in a Belgian bar. Would have added the fifth star if they paired the beers with a specific burger."
12,Ellis, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to eat and interesting burgers. But they didn't get it right at all. Had to ask for the fries and for the second beer twice. Brought one burger with onions although we ordered without. And no word about the fact, that these ‚Ä¶"

14,Ellis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We visited Ellis in Bruges and it was amazing. But this one was nowhere close. The burger wasn't hot or even crispy. It was a big disappointment, when compared to the Belgium one"

18,Ellis, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We had to wait 30 minutes to order our dinner. The food comes very fast, but was only lukewarm, not hot. The burger was good and the sides were ok."
19,Ellis, 1 star ,2 years ago,I am right inside the place now with my boyfriend (Koningsdag/King‚Äôs day). We are from Brussels and came in as seeing Ellis as the salvation board for the food today. ‚Ä¶
20,Ellis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for lunch outside the office. Friendly and fast service with very tasty food -definitely not your usual burger. Delicious coffee too!
21,Ellis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a great place for a quick bite to eat and a beer!  The restaurant across the street was in the middle of their lunch/dinner changeover so the server actually recommended I come here.  Great advice.  :)
