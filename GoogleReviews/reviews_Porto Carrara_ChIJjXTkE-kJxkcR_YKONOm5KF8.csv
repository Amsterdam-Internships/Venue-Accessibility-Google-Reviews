0,Porto Carrara, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"cheap, delicious and fast service
What else can i say~~~
The portions were also huge! Was not expecting that for the price, was pleasantly suprised"
1,Porto Carrara, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing food very good prices, pizzas starting at 5 euros very friendly owner since 40 years"
2,Porto Carrara, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I loved it! Nice relaxed music, nice staff, beautiful environment, superb prices for students and budget tight people! Payed 8.5‚Ç¨ for a pizza (5‚Ç¨) that I almost couldn't finish (almost, it was quite good) and a Heineken beer (3.5‚Ç¨). If I lived in Amsterdam I'd come here often! Thanks!"
3,Porto Carrara, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Unfortunatelly a big dissapointmemt. We have waited nearly one hour for lasagne, which was cold in the middle. Pasta Quatro Fromage was also poor. Not recommend."
4,Porto Carrara, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Super nice pizza and good served
5,Porto Carrara, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Me and my friends ate here last night and we were treated horribly. We ordered 2 pizzas and one risotto. The risotto came out within 10 minutes and was piping hot, leaving my other friends without food for another hour. The 2 pizzas took ‚Ä¶"
6,Porto Carrara, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice little place with a good menu and your basics for wine and beer. The best thing is not only the price, but a good quality pizza as well. Handmade and classically baked pizza doesn‚Äôt get better for ‚Ç¨5. Not far from trams 1 & 2 and close to much of the action A‚ÄôDam has to offer."
7,Porto Carrara, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Been here pretty often but the wait is often very long, especially this time, we had to wait 1 hour for pizza while one of us had her pasta in 10 minutes, we had to ask them 3 times before we got the pizza when we finally got the pizza they ‚Ä¶"
8,Porto Carrara, 1 star ,3 years ago,absolutely disgusting. this is the first restaurant i‚Äôve been genuinely disappointed with. ‚Ä¶
9,Porto Carrara, 1 star ,3 months ago,No tasty ! Don't spend your money here
10,Porto Carrara, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Now for 5 euro's you think the foods not going to be great, but I was surprised. The food came up after 10-15mins which I think is good and the size is what you would expect, and it tasted really good like as if you payed 10 euro's for it. ‚Ä¶"
11,Porto Carrara, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The most friendly pizzeriaboss in Amsterdam. With the cheapest good quality pizza's in town. A place where i like to invite all my family and friends üëç No better cozy place to feel you like home üëç
12,Porto Carrara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best budget friendly pizzerias located at the leidseplein. Has become my regular hangout joint for pizzas :) Delicious pizzas and awesome service!
13,Porto Carrara, 4 stars ,6 years ago,It's not the first visit when you're surprised but when you're there a second time and the owner remembers your name and your favourite drink. Enjoy the best and cheapest Pizza in Amsterdam.
14,Porto Carrara, 3 stars ,10 years ago,"Meh. Prices are really cheap (you'd be hard pressed to find pizzas for ‚Ç¨5 in Italy), but perhaps as a result of my travelling in a large group, the pizza wasn't really cooked, and they kind of screwed up with the yeast - my Arrabbiata was full of bubbles, and pale on the bottom. Other pizzas didn't seem to have this problem."
15,Porto Carrara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly, good food, and very cheap.
But if there are a lot of people you maybe have to wait one hour for a pizza."
16,Porto Carrara, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very reasonably priced , the food is decent and service is slow. There is no music hence feels like a dead place. Good if you want to fill your stomach in less price, but nothing great about it üòÄ"
17,Porto Carrara, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cheap food, almost everything is 5 euros. But you get a tasty pizza for the price and the staff is very friendly"
18,Porto Carrara, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very cheap, but very tasty pizza's. The calzone is great. The owner is very friendly and recognizes all his regulars."
19,Porto Carrara, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Just 5‚Ç¨ for a pizza or pasta? What amazing value. With atmosphere inside too. Highly recommended.
20,Porto Carrara, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, great prices, service could be quicker but worth a look if in the area."
21,Porto Carrara, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Gazolas is a very nice place. We smoke a lot weed before we eat and then we eat. It is legen... Wait for it... Dary. Legendary
22,Porto Carrara, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This restaurant is perfect, is cheap and delicious. The pasta and the pizza are homemade. Is the best Italian restaurant in √Åmsterdam."
23,Porto Carrara, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We have been there twice, the first was very good and the second awful. Looks like the chefs were completely different"
