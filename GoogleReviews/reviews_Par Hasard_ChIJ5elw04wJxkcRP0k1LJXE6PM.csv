0,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Wonderful restaurant. Genuinely friendly service and quality food. They are justifiably proud of their fries and all main meal choices are paired with being enjoyed together with fries. Also their deserts were really, really good. I recommend this restaurant unreservedly."
1,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Best burger I've had in Amsterdam! We had the beef stew and deluxe burger. Both were delicious. The staff were super nice and attentive, although it took them a bit longer to respond later when the restaurant got busier. Will definitely go back"
2,Par Hasard, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"The fries were not crispy so would not recommend this place to eat that. However their grilled chicken tasted amazing, drunken me really loved it. Bitterballen also good! And my friend ordered the ribs, they were tender indeed üòå although the sauce on it was less interesting."
3,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A lovely restaurant with great service and tasty food.

We had a cheeseburger that was deliciously juicy and a fish (in beer batter) and ‚Ä¶"
4,Par Hasard, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Ordered a large fries. Was about 70% full.
Overcooked and oily. ‚Ä¶"
5,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Went there during Christmas eve and we were the last customer. The shop was kind enough to take our order though we only came for fries and beer. It was one of the famous restaurants for frites. The fries is good. They have a very cool bar counter as well.
6,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"My husband and I visited Par Hasard on a Saturday afternoon, enjoying some rare time alone without the kids. The service was great, and we really enjoyed the fish & chips and hamburger we shared. The atmosphere was nice and we felt able to enjoy our meal at a leisurely Dutch pace. We will definitely be returning to Par Hasard."
7,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly staff and great food. Tasted awesome...!we had fries and Krokett which I can absolutely recommend. Was a bit hard to find the Restaurant but it's absolutely worth it. I also liked the interior of the Restaurant. Just lovely...!
8,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Gone there 3 times in the past 2 weeks. The fish & chips is hands down one of the best I've had in years: crisp, light batter, fish not under or overcooked. The fries, croquettes and spareribs top notch. The burger was a little over cooked so it's best to specify how you want your meat cooked. Staff is very professional. I'll come back."
9,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice Bitterballen. If you get the mix, you get beef, cheese and shrimp-filled ones. The opening hours are a bit odd, but the service is quick and friendly."
10,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good crispness on the outside while soft inside. Generally good consistency and one of the better place to enjoy fries in Amsterdam. Recommend it!
11,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing had 2 #Vegan Burger options, and flesh available as well... Delicious, I repeat, Delicious... PlanetaryCultures.Org"
12,Par Hasard, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Food was quite ok, but we had a very bad experience with the bill. We paid twice the amount for our drinks. After flagging the issue to the waitress, we were told ‚Äúno you are wrong‚Äù without any option to discuss. Quite a pity, first restaurant where we face this kind of issue in Amsterdam !"
13,Par Hasard, 1 star ,11 months ago,"Our first and last experience. The snacks were ok but the fries were soggy. But the most horrible of all is that they charged us 7 euro extra for no reason. So if you still feel like going there, calculate the total cost beforehand... and ask for the receipt!"
14,Par Hasard, 1 star ,a year ago,"Ordered via Ubereats. The fries were cold and weak, the sate wasn‚Äôt from chicken but from a cow and the salad was not delivered at all. The portion size was fine, quite large actually, but 55 euro for bad quality fries and the wrong meat is ‚Ä¶"
15,Par Hasard, 1 star ,a year ago,We were there for take away. They didn't let us know when the food is ready. Then I went to pick it up and we started eating in front of the store so that it doesn't get more colder. They kicked out of us from there. Taste of fries was nice ‚Ä¶
16,Par Hasard, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Food is great but very expensive, service is very friendly. Am a regular here. Reason for not giving 5 stars is the mentioned pricepoint and the fact that 1 in 3 orders there is a difference between what was ordered vs what was received. ‚Ä¶"
17,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best potato chips and gin and tonic I had! Really good sauces, everything is amazing."
18,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really great fish and chips. Fries were fantastic. The fish was lightly coated and cooked perfectly. The cafe also offers take out so after our meal we got another batch of fries to go!
19,Par Hasard, 1 star ,10 months ago,üçü got fries with so many black/blue spots. The potatoes were old and they did not bother to remove those. The oil they use taste gas-oil.
20,Par Hasard, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Par Hasard has a great, lively atmosphere and I've been there more than once..... To be honest.
My out of town guests in September enjoyed the live music. The food is adequate, ‚Ä¶"
21,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It is a nice looking bar with a wide variety of beers. Food is more than great for bar food. Service is also good.
22,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Our first Amsterdam meal, as recommended by a foodie friend. It was absolutely great. We asked for only a small portion but regretted it after enjoying the stew and fish with fries. Their wine collection already tells you specific notes so ‚Ä¶"
23,Par Hasard, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"For the best fries in town, our batch were half burnt. And only one server on a Saturday, made the service slow."
24,Par Hasard, 3 stars ,11 months ago,"Nice restaurant (informal). The food is good, the staff are a little direct. Overall a fine place to dine though."
25,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best bartender in Amsterdam!
Great service and wonderful food from chef Vincenzo. Just loved it"
26,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy place to drink a glass of wine, tasty Cesar salad, but not fast service."
27,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Finished our stay in Amsterdam by going to this restaurant that we discovered by chance. What an incredible surprise! The waiter was very friendly, he recommended us great food selection, our meals were tasty and the wine selection was ‚Ä¶"
28,Par Hasard, 1 star ,a year ago,"What a horrible place in corona times...order and then be told to stand outside in the cold while the staff wanders around and takes their time.  15 minutes for frites with no salt....and then open the bag to add salt and the bottom falls out.  Run, don't walk, far away from this place."
29,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice and cozy environment, the service really surprised me considering this is in Amsterdam. The staff was nice and very attentive. I had the beef stew which I thought was really good and a really tasty option you don't usually find in Amsterdam. I'll definitely come back."
30,Par Hasard, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Its a nice place with a pretty cool atmosphere.
The fries are delicious as well.
However, it was quite empty and felt too quite as there was no music playing.
Also, the prices are a little high."
31,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great croquets, great fries, great dips. Would recommend for sure."
32,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good fries. Slow service (~40 minutes wait)
33,Par Hasard, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Amazing flavourful fries, nice service lovely atmosphere! The truffle sauce was incredible :) this restaurant is not that close to the center of Amsterdam but the walk there is definitely worth it ;)"
34,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Interesting hipster mix of fine dining vibe with excellent frites and fancier food also available. I go there for the Patatje Oorlog. Would recommend. ‚Ä¶
35,Par Hasard, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Overpriced ""elite"" snackbar. Ordered fries with sauce, had to pay ‚Ç¨1,50 for the sauce only, which I got in a tiny little cup. After I asked for a bit more cause I didn't have enough, they wanted to charge me another ‚Ç¨1,50. Walked away, never coming again."
36,Par Hasard, 1 star ,3 years ago,Shocking. Ordered food at our table. No sign of cooking in the kitchen. We were the ONLY couple in the entire building. 30 minutes later I ask where our food is. To which the waiter ran to the kitchen. We left without eating and we find the waiter frying our food. Avoid this place if you don't want to waste your holiday time.
37,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome atmosphere and friendly service at reasonable prices for Amsterdam. This was the second time that we visited and we were happy to have found this place. ‚Ä¶
38,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great frites! Super crispy with scratch made mayonnaise - delicious
39,Par Hasard, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I wanted to check out this place for a while, and yesterday was the day for me to finally give it a try. Oh man, I don't know if I can even write a review for the food... but here you go, as usual notes for myself in case I am here again. ‚Ä¶"

Fantastic service
Good wine list ‚Ä¶"

In case you feel like having a sit down dinner the menu is also good and the restaurant has a nice ambiance"
42,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Indeed French frieds are very good. Nice place for a drink and have dinner
43,Par Hasard, 1 star ,a year ago,"I would like to share here that I played a live music performance at Par Hasard Ceintuurbaan in February with a bass player, and it took me 4 and a half months and many (partly unanswered) e-mails, calls and messages to get my money. I don't recommend to fellow musicians to say yes if they're asked to play music at this restaurant."
44,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Really nice chips and battered food, fair prices, good service, great for a quick meal"
45,Par Hasard, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It was ok. Ordered a large portion of fries but surprisingly got the smallest cup of mayo. Also had a lot of small, hard over fried fries. Tasted great though"
46,Par Hasard, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food is great. However, very poor service. They forgot half our order! They offered a solution.. This would take 3 days to happen after reminding them constantly!! And they didn‚Äôt deliver everything they promised. ‚Ä¶"
47,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This review is only about the frys, summary=Great frys and service, I would ask next time to put the salt myself, sate sauce is yum, would be super if they add vegan mayo sauces as well, then it will be 5 Stars patat :)"
48,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Stopped by for some chips and croquets. Really delicious. Had chips with the truffle mayo and veal croquet. Highly recommend this place. Can either take away or sit in the bar/restaurant.
49,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Nice place to take a break in a quiet street. Love the interior !!!
50,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,a year ago,We went in expecting just chips done to a high standard and ended up having amazing satay chicken and steak with a nice bottle of wine (as well as great chips).
51,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best fries meet the best wine and beer list!
52,Par Hasard, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"We only stopped for beer at night. They had a good selection of beers and the staff was very friendly. However, the whole place smelled like chemical toilet cleaner to us, what a bummer!"
53,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"What is nice about this friterie is there is a restaurant and bar adjoined in case you fancy dinner or drinks. Otherwise, the cafe has some casual seating where you can enjoy the frites. ‚Ä¶"
54,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great service,  good solid Dutch food.  The fried stuff (croquettes etc) are amazing and the zuurvleis is a must. They have rump and bavette steak too."
55,Par Hasard, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great Dutch food. Wonderful service. Best fries in Netherlands and in Belgium. Inexpensive and enjoyable place. A ""Must"" stop in Amsterdam!"
56,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Delicious fried Dutch nibbles on a platter for starters were worth the visit alone!  Fish and chips; white asparagus; burgers and homemade chips are on offer. Chips are great!
57,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Makes visiting the snackbar feel a little haute cuisine! Fries were great, but the frikandel was not to my liking. Great ambiance though!"

61,Par Hasard, 1 star ,a year ago,Very unfriendly rude bold staf guy outside was angry because i come to close to him and also extremely high prices for this kind of food  would not recommend to any one! Also the did not give you any mayonaise greedys
62,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place to grab a cup of coffee or wine. Stayed here for about an hour. Staff could be a tiny bit friendlier. They did not seem to care about you visiting the place.
63,Par Hasard, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty creamy shrimp croquettes and fresh Fish and Chips. Good portion, good quality and not too pricey."
64,Par Hasard, 1 star ,3 years ago,If I could give it zero stars I would but I have to give at least one to write a review. ‚Ä¶
65,Par Hasard, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Ok. Nothing special and slow service but friendly. Steak expensive for the price given the small size. Fries nice
