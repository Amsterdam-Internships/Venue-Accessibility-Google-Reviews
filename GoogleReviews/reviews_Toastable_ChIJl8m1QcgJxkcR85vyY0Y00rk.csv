2,Toastable, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Delicious toasted sandwiches that are stuffed to the brim. Not much else to add, except that it's a darn good toasted sandwich. Staff is friendly, but just be patient, it's only one person taking orders and preparing the food."

39,Toastable, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious toasts, lovely stuff, we loved it"
40,Toastable, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The toastie I had was amazing, however the place was let down by customer service. We waited ages to be served, then another age to get our toastie. We thought that it would be a quick bite and then back out to tourism. However we ended up spending an hour in there. Also we did not feel particularly welcomed."
41,Toastable, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"What a fantastic place! No matter what you order from here, the food is always delicious as can be. The toasties are to die for! I recommend ‚ÄòThe Legend‚Äô, which tastes superb as well as the dip that comes along with it. It‚Äôs such a clean ‚Ä¶"
