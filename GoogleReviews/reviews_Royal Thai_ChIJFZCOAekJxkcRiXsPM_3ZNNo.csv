0,Royal Thai, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Delicious food, enough vegetarian options and friendly service with a smile. We were afraid this would be a tourist trap, but it's not! We're from Amsterdam and we like this Thai the best. Very good food, enough rice and a good atmosphere. We'll come again."
1,Royal Thai, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Very good food but if you are willing to wait for your food then worth it üëå  very Busy In the evening.
Empty places says it all üëçüçª"
2,Royal Thai, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Food was delicious and crew were polite and friendly. But it took too long for them to bring the food. In some dishes they too many ingredient which wasn't a proper addition to other ingredient. Also they didn't clean some shrimps so the black line was there and you should be careful when you wanted to eat them.
3,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,5 months ago,This was the BEST CURRY I have ever eaten!! And the waiter was super nice!!
4,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Arrived off plane, checked in and decided to have something to eat as it was 6pm - we walked to the Royal Thai and managed to get a table before the evening rush but booking is recommended. Had a lovely meal. Every dish was well presented ‚Ä¶"
5,Royal Thai, 1 star ,5 months ago,It couldn‚Äôt be worse! 40 mins waiting time for a bottle of wine and then another hour for simple starters. The restaurant is more focused on their takeaway orders. Absolutely unprofessional and not customer oriented.
6,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious food and cosy place to be. Love it so muchüëçüèøüòäüòäüòä!
7,Royal Thai, 1 star ,6 months ago,"The food is gross, huge quantity but low quality, the ink fish was gummy, the soups smelled like dish soap and none of the staff was thai.
They serve drinks directly in the glass, without showing from where it comes, ‚Ä¶"
8,Royal Thai, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Unfortunately to say that this Thai doesnt use fresh ingredients. I took a dish with Gamba‚Äôs in it and it didnt smell yummie to start with. They used a lot of garlic to overrule the smell of the Gamba‚Äôs because those were not fresh. Thai ‚Ä¶
9,Royal Thai, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We had such a lovely Thai cuisine and atmosphere staffs were very friendly and reasonable price strongly recommended.
10,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best Thai cuisine experience in Amsterdam! Surprising tastes, clean foods, beautiful presentation, lovely restaurant and interiors, super polite staff, high quality ! Highly recommend !"
11,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I had such an amazing lunch here. The service lady was awesome! She even introduce me to Chef who was actually a really nice person!!! Totally recommended. Tom kha Kai! Is a must dish!
12,Royal Thai, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Prices are high for the quality you receive.
Don't order Pad Thai, very bad taste.
All other plates we got were less than average quality. The team is smiley and nice. The problem is in their kitchen quality."
13,Royal Thai, 1 star ,4 months ago,Our food is still not here - it is over an hour later than they told us it would be. We called the restaurant half an hour ago and they said it should be there very soon. We have tried to call them again since multiple times from different phones and they won't pick up. Terrible service.
14,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quick and friendly service, unexpected good food in this touristic area in the city center. ‚Ä¶"
15,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I lived in Thailand for a while, and this Khai Phad King (chicken & ginger stir fry) brought me right back. ‚Ä¶"
16,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We went for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday and I must say the food and vibe was amazing.
17,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very tasty and really very spicy as we wanted.
18,Royal Thai, 1 star ,2 months ago,"Over 35 minutes delay when ordering, and no updates about when the food will arrive‚Ä¶"
19,Royal Thai, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Was charged 5.75 for bottled water. Portion size is way small and inadequate for dinner. What's worse, spotted a rat at the entrance"
20,Royal Thai, 2 stars ,11 months ago,"Westernized thai with tourist prices. The pad thai was a disappointment in terms of taste, while the Tom Yum Kai had more chicken than soup. Menu is suited to those who cannot handle spicy food."
21,Royal Thai, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very Good Thai food in AMS !!! Cozy environment
22,Royal Thai, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Worst experience in a restaurant in a long time. We had a veggie spring rolls and soups. The rolls were good (thus the 2 stars), but the soup was awful, made from concerned soup and with a chemical taste. We could not finish the dishes, ‚Ä¶"
23,Royal Thai, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food for a fair price.
24,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best Thai spots in Amsterdam! Great food, service and delivery. Always tasty and smooth/easy delivery, quick to respond when delivery was wrong as well!"
25,Royal Thai, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very attentive staff here. Good food and good service. They have plenty of vegan options. They did accidentally bring me chicken when I ordered tofu, but luckily I noticed right away and they were quick to replace it. Perhaps a bit on the pricey side."
26,Royal Thai, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Not the best food when it comes to try the thai food
27,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, lots of choices. Food came quick after ordering."
28,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very great Food!!!! Mild and Spicey
29,Royal Thai, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Thai in the heart of Amsterdam, great food and service, bit pricey though."
30,Royal Thai, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food was good and the service of the workers there is excellent. The concept of the dining is to share different plates of food dishes amongst each other. The Rice is included in the price.
31,Royal Thai, 1 star ,a year ago,"I mean maybe the food would be nice if it didn't take 1.5 hours to arrive after ordering online. This is the antipathy of good service and they were not at all helpful in explaining why it took that long, nor did they offer any consolation. Terrible service, just buy from someone else these chumps are clueless"
32,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food, the set meals are well thought through with a range of dishes.
The staff are very friendly and happy to provide advice and suggestions.
Stairs up to the restaurant are steep."
33,Royal Thai, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, but very Europeanised - I didn't feel like I was taken back to Thailand with authentic flavours and dishes. The nice thing about this place is that reservations are required which keeps out random tourists in this very busy area."
34,Royal Thai, 1 star ,6 years ago,"This restaurant was terrible. The sweet and sour vegetarian dish tasted like someone could have cooked it in a dorm room, the curry we tried had so much coconut it drowned out the other flavors, and it was so sweet it tasted more like a ‚Ä¶"
35,Royal Thai, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Would give it 4 stars but the prices are a bit high for what you get. Quality is overall good but there are better place son Amsterdam.
36,Royal Thai, 3 stars ,6 years ago,I was here on 13 June 2015. I decided to take away 1 Thai Pineapple Fried rice. It cost Euro 13.50. Food was nice. But they forgotten to give me disposable cutlery. Luckily I have my own which is always in my suitcase. The gentleman who ‚Ä¶
37,Royal Thai, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was alright, sauces tasted of corn syrup rather than traditional ingredients. Servers were friendly, not very quick. When I asked for a sherry, I was given a mixture of Ouzo and white wine. Furthermore, I was overcharged, noticeably, ‚Ä¶"
38,Royal Thai, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Slow service made this 2 stars, waited at least 15 minutes after our starter to clear our plates and another 10 for our main to come out. Food was nice, then at the end we had to wait another 10 minutes after I asked for the food to be put into takeaway containers and another 10 minutes for the card machine to arrive"
39,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Authentic taste and nice staff
40,Royal Thai, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food very generic, not fresh, meat and fish clearly frozen. Waitresses kind though sloppy and lazy. Wait time veeeery long, we came with a coupon deal and it took nearly 2 hours with last 30 minutes waiting for a serving of ice cream. Clearly edible food, but I would not recommend it to my enemy."
41,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Delicious food. Just had a dinner there last night after seeing good reviews. The food was so tasty and authentic thai. Staff were nice too. Recommended very much
42,Royal Thai, 2 stars ,3 years ago,It is okay... I don't like their chicken.... The massaman sauce was nice. But they don't seem to put care into the way the cut and cook the chicken pieces. I've had a lot better ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
43,Royal Thai, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Tasty pretty good quality meat. Not excellent but quite good.  Maybe a litttle bit on the pricey side for some dishes but all in all it makes up for a good evening.
44,Royal Thai, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent Thai food, not the cheapest we've had in Amsterdam but portions are a good size to get you full. It's also one of the few places that are open later."
45,Royal Thai, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"In an tourist hotspot where 9 out of 10 restaurants are bad, Royal Thai is definitely one of the very best choises in the area. The dishes could be a bit more spicy. I really enjoyed the chicken Laab."
46,Royal Thai, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Good food for the price, there is a room for improvement"
47,Royal Thai, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was really, really good, but the service was unbelievable slow. It took over 40 minutes to get our food after ordering, and 10-15 minutes to get the check after requesting it. There were only three occupied tables in the restaurant at the time."
48,Royal Thai, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Seriously good food! Maybe the best Thai food we've ever had, so much flavour and a great selection (including for vegetarians). Highly recommended, amazing food, service, atmosphere and price."
49,Royal Thai, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Not recommended
