0,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"If you think DC doesn't know pizza, you've never been to the Red Light.  Their Detroit Style pizza rivals some of the best in it's class.  The OG Pepperoni was perfect, the cheese was plentiful and tasty, the sauce had a kick, the pepperoni ‚Ä¶"
1,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,a month ago,Phenomenal pizza!! My favorite was the burrata. Will definitely be back and recommend to friends. They have a large area with outdoor seating and a few heat lamps hanging from the ceiling.
2,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,"As a Detroit native, the pizza is a 4/5 in my book. Great toppings (especially the Greenfield Village), but the crust is a bit soft and lacks a good chew. The ranch and other dressings are incredible, though. I‚Äôm not normally a ranch on ‚Ä¶"
3,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,a month ago,"This place is the best. The detroit pizza is insanely good. I recommend going classic and doing pepperoni. Cocktails are a bit pricey for a place like this but they are good. Great vibe, great patio."
4,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"This place is a solid neighborhood favorite. Great drinks (they even have a Pimms Cup!) and their Burrata pizza is amazing. All pizza is Detroit-style, which we love, yet is often harder to find elsewhere."
5,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great place to hang-out with friends! They serve delicious and palatable pizzas like no other.I highly recommended this place!
6,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,2 months ago,Love this place. But is the Greenfield pizza no longer vegan? Vegan cheese seems to no longer be on the menu on that item. Im not vegan but this was a great place to get a regular pizza and accommodate people who are also vegan.
7,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good drinks and fries (they were a bit a salty though). Bartender was friendly and knowledgeable. Nice ambiance. Outdoor patio has heaters. There are happy hour specials. See pictures for menu.
8,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It was a chill location. Bartender was very nice and efficient. The place has a nice design. Menu was different, it didn‚Äôt really have a lot to offer. Not a place to come if you‚Äôre super hungry. The pizza was okay not the best probably a 3/5 but the fries were delicious! Non alcoholic drinks came in a large size which is good!"
9,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Always loved red light for its chill vibe, more mature clientele, and great people-watching spot on 14th. Now even better with Detroit-style pizza. The sauce, cheese, and crust are all incredible. Perfect with a couple beers or glasses of wine from the happy hour menu. Friendly service too üëå"
10,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,I did not eat dinner there. My brother and I went for a few drinks.  The bartender was great and very attentive. Nice place to go and relax.
11,Red Light Bar, 2 stars ,a year ago,Pizza crust was nice but everything else was bad. Overpriced with cheap ingredients that manages to be both too salty and tasteless at the same time.
12,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Found this spot while scoping out the area looking for somewhere halfway decent to eat and maybe get to sit down to enjoy it in the midst of all the Covid restrictions. Found it... Chill vibes, throw back tunes, cold beer, and bangin pizza. Stuffed my fat face till I had the tomato sweats.. Worth every bit. A+++"
13,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,11 months ago,The pizza is daangg good. Highly recommend. They could use a more organized seating situation but oh well. Drinks and food A+.
14,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,6 months ago,It was more expensive than I expected. But I would say it's worth it for a night out with friends.
15,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Good pizza, friendly staff. Kind of small, but they have a patio in the warmer months."
16,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We tried the new Detroit Style Pizza (take out).  It was delicious. Pricey? You decide... 2 pies, 8 squares $32.  We will go back for more."
17,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,a year ago,"I ordered two pizzas on Super Bowl night, figuring that would be enough for four people. I ordered via phone for pickup and was told it would be a 45 min wait. I arrived 45 minutes later, but It took over 90 minutes before my pizza was ‚Ä¶"
18,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,2 months ago,This place has the cleanest room in DC!!! The pizza is on point as well! ‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüëç
19,Red Light Bar, 1 star ,10 months ago,It‚Äôs been 3 years I‚Äôve been going to bars in DC and the experience at Redlight was very disappointing. I wish I could give less than 1 star. Bar tender is indecent and misbehaved. He is a womanizer. He was constantly drinking with his ‚Ä¶
20,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,a year ago,"They have deep dish Detroit style pizza. We had the vegan pizza; it was pretty good. We ordered cocktails that tasted like they had no alcohol in them at all. Not to mention, the cocktails are really expensive! For the price I'm paying, I'd expect a well crafted drink.  Very overpriced for the quality of the drinks and service."
21,Red Light Bar, 2 stars ,a year ago,We ordered the detroit style pizza tonight because of all the hype. Crust was great everything else wasn't. The pizza top was undercooked and didn't look anything like the other pictures people posted. The onions were almost raw. We also ordered boneless wings which came with bones and were probably the worst wings I've ever had.
22,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Got the burrata pizza. Took it home and the burrata was still frozen. Had to microwave the hot pizza to get the burrata cool not frozen. Not a good first impression. Was good otherwise and MIGHT try it again because it's close. Maybe.
23,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great fluffy crust. Perfect representation of Detroit style pizza. Sausage was some of the best I've had on a pizza and I typically don't go for it. Both the white sauce and red sauce taste great! I would suggest anything on their menu, it will not disappoint!"
24,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing Detroit-style pizza.  The best of all the places I've tried so far in the DMV.  Their patio is a great spot (inside is small) and they have a good happy hour (which used to run until 8 or so).  Do wish they had a greater variety/different beer but otherwise, it's great."
25,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"nice atmosphere and environment
drinks were pretty good and bartenders were entertaining"
26,Red Light Bar, 1 star ,2 months ago,Very bad hygiene the cook wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask right and was using gloved hand to move this mask and then continues cooking
27,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,The staff are really friendly. We were walking by the other day and they were advertising their take out so we picked some up it was delicious. The hostess/manager (not sure who sorry!) was very friendly and energetic. I walk by all the time without thinking about red light but I will definitely be back.
28,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Detroit style pizza is the best type of pizza in the United States of America. Period. Their crust is iconic to the original recipe of Detroit Style pizza! A1 . You will not regret eating here.
29,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Truly amazing pizza! The burrata pizza is fantastic. Best pizza in DC in my opinion.
30,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The Detroit pizza is legit! Some of the best tomato sauce I have ever had on a pizza. Had the pepperoni and the Belle Isle vegetarian, both were full of flavor. They got the crust spot on! It was nice and crispy. Detroit pizza is about way more than just the shape, and these guys got it right."
31,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Best Detroit-style pizza I've had in DC
32,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Perfect spot for outdoor drinks. Central location and great socially distanced tent setup. Wine selection is small, but the prices are great"
33,Red Light Bar, 1 star ,a year ago,Got my dine in pizza to go with no apologies and it was literally two slices boxed for hefty price I paid. Ughh. Pathetic service! Server literally grabbed the ipad/tablet before I could sign and submit the tip and sign which was rude. Would probably never go there again!
34,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Detroit-style pizza!!!
The indoor space is very, very small so overall this place seems hard to frequent as a newcomer, but the food was üíØ and they have a lot of drink options. Plus the patio is dog friendly!"
35,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,9 months ago,The motor city pizza was amazing. This will be treat because its a little expensive. The four square pizza was $21.
36,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"After reading the reviews here, I decided to try it out. Mainly for the desserts, unfortunately the bar tender mentioned that this place went through a makeover in August and got rid of the variety of desserts with the exception of 3. She ‚Ä¶"
37,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,The Motor City was LEGIT and DELICIOUS. Ambassador Salad was so tasty! Highly recommend for DETROIT style pizza!!! Arrived fast and hot too!!!
38,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,This is the most Detroit-y pizza I have ever had -  Yearly family visit to the original Buddy's Pizza on Conant Street has seemed to permanently ruin my opinion of most other pizza - but at last!!! Found my new spot.
39,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Holy smokes! I just moved to DC from Detroit a few months ago. This pizza is like 3/4 of the way from Jets to Buddy‚Äôs. ‚Ä¶
40,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The pizza and drinks were great. Came here in the winter and there is very little seating inside, looks like it might be a better option in the summer when the patio is open."
41,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"nice enough little bar but they need some simple foods, like french fries or onion rings or warm pretzels or something. The desserts are just ok, if you go, go for just a drink... don't go hungry.  kind small but I still like patronizing a small local business, and drink prices were good. I'd go back."
42,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty solid place over all. The bartender Twan* (sp;  or Twon) is the best--super conversational, friendly, real chill, makes a good drink and will fix it for you if it isn't to your liking. Music is always dope--usually an alternative ‚Ä¶"
43,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great spot on corner with music, outside seating with a view"
44,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,9 months ago,There on a Saturday night.  The place was packed! The staff was accomadating. The pizza was amazing!
45,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was great!! A little hectic trying to order and navigate the bar...but the pizza is well worth it! AND their fountain Coke is SOOO good!!! LOL
46,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Come here for drinks and sit outside. The people watching up and down 14th street made this a great date hang out spot for me. I normally order aperol spritz here and not too familiar with the food or beer selection. They make a meal ‚Ä¶
47,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"I stopped in last weekend during Red Light's soft opening and our party of 4 was seated quickly on the crowded patio on Saturday evening. Granted, it was drizzling, but the staff were pleasant, accommodating, and settled us comfortably ‚Ä¶"
48,Red Light Bar, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The ambiance at red light is awesome, great outdoor seating and cool indoor vibes. That being said, I waited 35 minutes for a plate of hummus with naan, and a caprese panini. When my order arrived, the sand which was wrong, which entailed ‚Ä¶"
49,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great corner bar on 14th St. Awesome outdoor area with space heaters and a window connecting to the bar. CC (not sure if that's how you spell it) is extremely friendly bartender, pleasure to talk to, as a with most of the staff from my experience."
50,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Came to DC for one night and didn't know the city at all, found this place and thought it was amazing!"
51,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good place with friendly staff. I believe that they dropped the pastry/dessert aspect to their business though. Still a wonderful place to sip well crafted beverages. High marks from me.
52,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,This is a small little bar on 14th street in the Logan Circle area. This is a great place to go if you are not wanting a big crowd after get done with work during the week. They have outdoor seating and you go up to a window to order ‚Ä¶
53,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,a week ago,Good Detroit pizza!
54,Red Light Bar, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"A negroni is three equal parts. If you mix up the proportions it's unpalatable. So is Red Light. Good in theory, but poorly executed--overwrought and tacky decorations, bad drinks (seriously how do you make a negroni taste like pure Campari ‚Ä¶"
55,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,a year ago,Customer service was great but cold inside and only 1 of the 3 tv's were on. Food was ok.
56,Red Light Bar, 1 star ,a year ago,"Does this restaurant care about how it treats its customers anymore? The staff here was so rude... to the point of absurdity, it was almost comical. I will never come here again."
57,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,7 months ago,great pizza and a good place to spend an evening
58,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Super friendly bartender and really good rose!!

60,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Great Detroit Style Pizza. Friendly staff for takeout.
61,Red Light Bar, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Open and spacious outside deck, not enough people working to service the area. Exspect long wait times ..."
62,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,10 months ago,"Great pizza, but the raw garlic in the sauce is overwhelming."
63,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Friendly bar staff. Nice outdoor seating. Definitely a popular place most any evening if the week.
64,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Red Light has THE best pizza in DC. It's a great spot.
65,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The outdoor porch of this bar is right on a busy intersection. This makes it the perfect place to people watch with a cold brew and an umbrella covering.
66,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I would have tipped Malachi like 40% if their credit card system had let me because he is probably the sweetest bartender I've ever had
67,Red Light Bar, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Took forever to get served.  Looks fun with the outdoor space but I can't be bothered going back if I need to wait 25 minutes for a drink.  Lazy baryenders
68,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Good business prices reasonable
69,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The pizza is good, but is a dive bar with 2 workers & sticky counters"
70,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice positive service, fun atmosphere. I highly recommend"
71,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Black owned.  Great pizza.  Black owned.  Amazing cocktails.  Did I mention it‚Äôs black owned? üòä
72,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great outdoor cafe but their kitchen is being remodeled so only drink options were available.
73,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Did not have the food but the drinks were fantastic and the bartenders were fantastic.
74,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The music was to loud, and they only serve beer, no cocktails. The ambiance was cool, they play nineties songs."
75,Red Light Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,My mobile order is never ready on time. It‚Äôs always late because the restaurant does not care about the delivery orders. Never ordering from here again.
76,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food took longer then I would like, but their drinks are reasonably priced."
77,Red Light Bar, 1 star ,a year ago,"Overpriced food, drinks. Beer was bad, cocktail was bad. Sorry guys, but I paid you money."
78,Red Light Bar, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Cool atmosphere inside but its kind of cramped. Double Chocolate pot de creme is outstanding.
79,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Courtyard is kinda cool. Food selection is basic bar stuff. Service could be improved.
80,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to chill and grab a drink on a weekend night. Great staff and atmosphere.
81,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Drinks were awesome and appetizers are very good. Spicy shrimp üòçüòç

83,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice casual indoor and outdoor patio space with excellent service, cold beer, and good drinks."

85,Red Light Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,They take forever to serve the food I wait for more than 40 minutes to get my order.
86,Red Light Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,Please look at your tab before leaving this establishment. They have run my card for the wrong order twice!
87,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,The best pizza you might not know about
88,Red Light Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,Zero service at the bar. Not even eye contact. I thought D.C. was so inclusive of everyone. Apparently not!

90,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing drinks. Great bartender. Yummy food
91,Red Light Bar, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"If you have not tried out the Indian rice fritters, you must! I would get two of these, you're going to like it."

97,Red Light Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,The grandma/Detroit style pizza is legit
98,Red Light Bar, 2 stars ,6 years ago,I hate it when a bartender is finding more importance in their phone than the experience of their customers.
