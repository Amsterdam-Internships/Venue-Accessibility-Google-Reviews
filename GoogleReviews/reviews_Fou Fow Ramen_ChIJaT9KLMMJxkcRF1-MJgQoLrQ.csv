0,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Amazing Ramen spot in Amsterdam! Great location, cozy ambience and fair prices. Literally one of the best ramen I‚Äôve had in years. I got the spicy one with pork. I also recommend ordering the gyozas and the vegetable dumplings. Great places for smaller groups. Service is quick."
1,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,a month ago,"I know few places with Ramen in Amsterdam this one is on the top of the list. Delicious Ramen, friendly staff, great green tea. I will become frequent guest I am sure !"
2,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Came without a booking around 14:00 on a Saturday and found a table straight away even though it was pretty crowded. Tried the miso ramen and gyoza, both good."
3,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Good noodles, soup was very filling and service was good. The restaurant is very bare when it comes to styling but that just adds to the home style atmosphere. Nothing too fancy just good ramen. üòãüëç"
4,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"The overall experience was good. I drank Sake for the first time, I liked it, It tastes milder than heavy drinks like Vodka."
5,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,5 months ago,This is quite a good ramen. I've been in Japan and ate ramen almost every day :) this is comparable to those streetfood ramen places. They could improve some details like eggs and meat and would be easily five stars. Gyoza  appetizers are really good.
6,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Delicious ramen at a great price! We ordered the Tonkatsu Classic Ramen and as an appetizer the gyozas. Both plates were very flavorful! Highly recommend this place.
7,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Wonderful place! Miso ramen was great the best ever. Many choices of veggie and vegan ramen. Gyoza veggie was excellent! Very much suggested!! The staff was really nice
8,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,a month ago,Just perfect! Find the place and dine. Don't even think about not visiting it.
9,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Ramen is the perfect meal when the weather is cold. There are no more words.
10,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"I had a great experience at the de Pijp location so I expected the same quality here. I had the chicken ramen with lemon broth. While the employees were friendly and the food was ready in a short time, the taste of the ramen was quite ‚Ä¶"
11,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Delicious !

If you like your food a bit spicy (without being too much), highly recommending the spicy red broth - amazing. My favorite in Amsterdam !"
12,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Amazing ramen! Definitely a place to go. Good attention and atmosphere. If you don‚Äôt have the CoronaCheck they let you sit outside.
13,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Amazing ramen (vegan options available & delicious), caring staff, tea reffiling (so nice when cold outside), would recommend anyone ‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠"
14,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"After 6 years in Tokyo and now residing in Amsterdam, finding a good Ramen place like Fou Fow makes me happy!"
15,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious ramen dishes!
Personally prefer the pork free broth, all components are individually tasty
Service is quick and friendly so if you see that you have a queue of people ‚Ä¶"
16,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Spicy vegan ramen! Creamy, filling, a little bit spicy and full of interesting textures and flavours. One of the best vegan ramens I've ever had - and I've had quite a few. So good I returned a week later to have it again. Take away and ‚Ä¶"
17,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Amazing ramen full of flavour. The space doesn't have that much of a vibe as it's really small and it's barely decorated but it's worth it just for the food.
It's better to make a reservation as the place is minuscule..."
18,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Definitely the best Ramen I've ever eaten in my all life. It's full of flavour, looks very nice and compared to the costs of the city and the really really good quality it isn't expensive. The restaurant is pretty small but the tables ‚Ä¶"
19,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I don't know if it was due to my hunger or so, but this ramen is seriously the best I had in my life. Rich broth, chewy noodles, much toppings. And don't forget the dumplings, well made, well seasoned. The place is a bit tiny and humid(?) but worth it!"
20,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"During a vacation with friends we happened to find this little japanese restaurant, really good place and delicious food!"
21,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,a month ago,"My go to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ramen place. very busy, customer service isn‚Äôt always great, but the tonkatau basic is a great meal for a fair price, try to enjoy it at least once a month."
22,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Easily the best reamen I've had! The broth was super rich, the meat was very tasty! The place is also quite full, so I can recommend coming earlier or having lots of patience - it's really worth it!"
23,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The gyoza are amazing but the ramen are disappointing. The ramen are not authentic Japanese ramen at all. The soups were not enough concentrated and the flavours are only ok-ish. Also, the chilli sauce on the table is not hot at all. I did not taste any spiciness even though I have already put 5 teaspoons of it into the ramen."
24,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Oh Boy! It is good!!!
On the first scoop of ramen I was sad knowing I will stop tasting that flavor after I am done. It is like a fireworks celebration on my taste buds when eating here. The chicken wings and dumplings are great too."
25,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Really average ramen at the most... The appetizers are not bad.

Broth was quite watery and full of fat. The noodles felt like they were not fresh but industrial. Not a very typical japanese place if it's what you are looking for..."
26,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Seriously the best ramen in town, personally I like the classic most. This place is located near the canals and close to the 9 streets area. It is small, opens at 12, be there in time to beat the crowded!"
27,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"I stopped in today on a whim when I was out with a friend.     Sadly I didn‚Äôt take photos, but we decided to wait for a table (less than 10 minutes) and we were not disappointed.     I got the vegetarian basic ramen with spinach, shiitake ‚Ä¶"
28,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,a month ago,"This ramen's flavour profile reminds me of home; I'm brought back to the table as a child, and there are no worries in my life anymore."
29,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"The chili oil/sauce on the desk is (a variation of) lao gan ma which is so bizarre, the tonkotsu ramen is okay although salty"
30,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It was very busy even on a weekday evening ! Wait time is not as bad as weekend though. Love their ramen! It‚Äôs the best in Amsterdam! Food came fast and service was good.
31,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Located in the beautiful district of Jordaan, this simplistic interpretation of Japanese Ramen has nothing to shy off. Be careful as it get really full quick and you‚Äôll have to get on the queue list. I did not see a Japanese cook, maybe ‚Ä¶"
32,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is small, a little bit small. And it‚Äôs always busy. If you sit outside, you can see the Anne Frank museum and the classic Amsterdam view.
But, the ramen, is might let you down, it‚Äôs salty, really. If you are a ramen ‚Ä¶"
33,Fou Fow Ramen, 1 star ,6 months ago,"It is very far from a good ramen. The taste was off, noodle very so so, extras weak in flavor. It get weird when we saw on menu CHICKEN char siu, and ordering Japanese tea doesn‚Äôt mean you get traditional beverage but a bottle of Oishii ‚Ä¶"
34,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Oh man, delicious ramen, love the spicy one. Make sure to get the crispy chicken wings as a start. They are slightly sweet and have a perfect crunch. ‚Ä¶"
35,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We had to wait for a table for 10 mins when we arrived around 2. The vegetarian ramen was quite nice, but the broth for both of our ramen was salty. It's still a convenient stop for a quick ramen in a fun and relaxed atmosphere"
36,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Most delicious ramen I‚Äôve ever eaten! I loved this place, they have lots of options for ramen and delicious starters (try the steamed veggie dumplings!) and the staff is friendly and  quick. They don‚Äôt take reservations, so be prepared to wait in line outside during the typical dinner hours as it‚Äôs quite the popular place."
37,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This restaurant is the best ramen restaurant I‚Äôve ever experienced here in the Netherlands. The quality of food cannot be overestimated. Staffs are extremely kind. Only weakness is that it‚Äôs too nice so it has always a waiting list. Highly recommend you!
38,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty good service, nice looking food. Price alright. But both me and my partner got stomach pain after it at the exact same time and needed to find a bathroom. Maybe its the effect of ramen? Or is it bad hygiene? I would not go again though. (Vegan and vegetarian ramen)"
39,Fou Fow Ramen, 1 star ,7 months ago,"People, I don‚Äôt know why this place has so many high reviews. I am a native New Yorker who loves Japanese food and especially ramen, and I have eaten at many top ramen restaurants in NYC, so I was excited to try this place. ‚Ä¶"
40,Fou Fow Ramen, 1 star ,a year ago,"First of all, you have to wait more than 20 minutes for a soup. Sounds fair, of course, when there‚Äôs a lot of customers and everything has to be prepared freshly. But when I came, all the customers had already been inside for 25 minutes (I ‚Ä¶"
41,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Had a great experience here yesterday. My friend and I ordered Tonkotsu and Miso ramen, along with the silken tofu appetizer. The appetizer was delicious and the perfect mix of textures and spice. I would have liked it even spicier but I ‚Ä¶"
42,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The Ramen is simply amazing and super satisfying with its flavors and well cooked ingredients. Definitely grateful to have been and it‚Äôs a spot I definitely recommend. ‚Ä¶
43,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I took my son Sam here, who is a real ramen connoisseur. He told me ‚Äúthis ramen is really good‚Äù with a surprised face ü§ó They have various kinds of broth (chicken, tonkotsu, vegetarian). For every broth there are basic, classic and classic ‚Ä¶"
44,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,a year ago,Ordered the vegetarian shoyu ramen and the miso ramen. Both of them the broth was nice and had depth in its flavor. The noodles were nice and the portion was big. Would definitely recommend if you are craving some Japanese ramen.
45,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the most delicious ramens I‚Äôve had for a while. I got the spicy version, which was just perfect amount of spice for my European taste. Great ambience and super lovely staff."
46,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I chose the vegetarian optio, which was ok, but the broth was way too salty, even for ramen standards, despite the Wait staff telling me it's supposed to be like that. It was still ok, but I would suggest getting the miso based ramen instead."
47,Fou Fow Ramen, 1 star ,6 months ago,I don‚Äôt understand why people are raving about this place. One thing is for sure.. the ramen is disgusting. Zero flavor! It was like eating salty water with pork. There are way better places that serve REAL ramen. ‚Ä¶
48,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice and friendly staff, reasonable prices, standard beef miso ramen is a bit too fat and the noodles could be thinner. Cute interior and great location!"
49,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great ramen and Gyoza. Liked our table outside it was rather quiet and had a nice view. I personally would have enjoyed a bigger menu for the beverages (pretty much all soda).
50,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Ramen sizes were good and tasty, and the dumplings were also delicious."
51,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely little spot in Jordaan with delicious ramen and other snacks. had the tonkotsu classic and it was great! Shout out to the homemade kimchi and chicken wings! Delicious!
52,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Follow my best reviews on Instagram @comfortcomida

They use SUPER fresh ingredients, but honestly not the best ramen I've had. I ‚Ä¶"
53,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I had a fairly long wait and the place was crowded with a layout that made it a bit loud and annoying. The Shio ramen I had was pretty good but not enough in my opinion to make up for the wait and crowding. That said, I think it's worth a try to come back and try a different kind of ramen later when it's less busy."
54,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent quality ramen. Was a minor mixup when ordering my food but was quickly resolved. Broth was very rich and filling, so much even that I wasn't able to finish the full bowl. Would visit again."
55,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Queueing customers are mostly Western.
Tried Classic Miso ramen and homemade Gyoza.
Miso ramen soup is somehow less-salty and Europeanized but able to enjoy Umami ‚Ä¶"
56,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I rarely write reviews if ever, but this place blew my mind away, Absolutely the best RAMEN in Amsterdam hands down for the price.  Visiting from Los Angeles, I had the Tori Ginger with chicken."
57,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A bit on the pricey side but probably average for this city. A ton of food with the extra portion hot ramen. Though hot is like ‚Äúhot‚Äù is to most Western European chefs: mild. Luckily there is hot sauce on the table to add. ‚Ä¶
58,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Staff couldn't handle to get groups seated according to the waiting list. Ramen didn't leave a lasting impression - broth was seasoned too lightly, the dish lacked of a variety of fresh garnish. Edamame was okay. Overall impression: average."
59,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Oshii ramen desu! Delicious ramen and nice place. I went in the lunch time and it had a line of people that was requested to put his name on a wait list. I was by myself and it was very fast to get a table. Staff are very friendly and work ‚Ä¶
60,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the most delicious ramens I‚Äôve had for a while. I got the spicy version, which was just perfect amount of spice for my European taste. Great ambience and super lovely staff."

64,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best lamens I had, ever! Really good, tasty and well prepared! The place is tiny, there was a wait time of about 30 minutes  when we arrived. Service is very good, and the prices are fair."
65,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I like their delicious ramen and good service.

69,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Just really good ramen..
70,Fou Fow Ramen, 1 star ,7 months ago,"such a disappointment‚Äô first of all, the brunette waitress was unfriendly and it felt like a burden to be a customer there. then, the miso soup was so salty and the fish broth of the shoyu was smelling like old fish, just overall so ‚Ä¶"
71,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It truly become one of my favorite ramen! The ginger lemon ramen, which soup base was like jianmuduck from taiwan but without alcohol contained, and add on a bit refreshing taste from the lemon, it was just perfect in such a cold weather. Very highly recommend if you want to have a soupy dish after a long day."
72,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love the food at both Fou Fows. This was my first time at this one (previously been to the other). Ramen was delicious, gyoza among the best I've had! Will definitely return. Try the Iki beer. Really nice and light."
73,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I had the tan tan men, the ramen and soup was very tasty. The egg however does not taste like the typical ramen egg and the yolk is not runny. Other than that, it was good."
74,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Always excellent, and I say so even after 10+ visits. The broth can be on the thick side sometimes but I never fail to love eating here. Personal favorite is the Tan Tan Men!"
75,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious ramen. The vegetarian broth had a lot of taste. And of course the pork broth was very tasty. Gyoza were excellent too. Great little place. Waiting outside was reasonable and once inside everything happened pretty quickly.
76,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"When you are planning on eating ramen, you might as well get some of the best in tow! Fou Fow Ramen delivers in its promise and is well worth the wait!"
77,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"There were many different options, also dome vegetarian/ vegan varieties. The vegan ramen was very sweet though.
The portions were very big!
We liked it a lot!"
78,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,a year ago,Good service and great food! Definitely a recommendation if you‚Äôre a ramen lover.
79,Fou Fow Ramen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"This restaurant is overrated. It was pretty packed when we came, but we didn't have to wait. There are about five different broth options, including tonkatsu, shio, etc. and for each option, you can get basic, classic (has spinach, bean ‚Ä¶"
80,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely humble ramen restaurant. We arrived at 8pm and only had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table. The interior is kooky and has a more home-feel about it than a polished restaurant. The food was very tasty with the ramen being flavoursome ‚Ä¶
81,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Tasty ramen options for meat-lovers, vegetarians and veganistas. And they have salmon as a starter/side dish! :) Japanese and oolong tea without sugar is a surprisingly great find! üëç"
82,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is your perfect winter cure! Warming bowls of goodness with home made nooodzzz - can recommend the tan tan men ramen, was an absolute treat!"
83,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow. The place is quite small but really cozy actually. It also has a small area outside to enjoy warm and sunny days. The view from the restaurant is amazing, in front of one of the thousands beautiful canal streets of Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
84,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Tantanmen was so delicious.  Very well prepared. Noodles were cooked in really boiled water and perfect timing with good 'koshi'üëç
85,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice little restaurant, great service, try the chicken wings as a starter!"
86,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very good quality ramen. Place is small and not so comfortable for eating when you are with many friends but the overall quality is outstanding compared with other places and atmosphere is really Japanese :)
87,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I'm a former New Yorker (ramen heaven these days) who has been to Japan, so my ramen standards are up there‚Äîand this is good ramen. Grateful I live so nearby... it's also my sick-day-pick-me-up. Service is just fine, hence the 4 stars instead of 5, but perfectly lovely and a great meal."
88,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place for a good ramen! Can be crowded and they don't take reservations, so take some time for it."
89,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,7 months ago,A little cozy restaurant serving very good ramen. Service is also good. You‚Äôll probably need to queue outside a bit as the place is quite popular and they don‚Äôt take bookings.
90,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Amazing Ramen restaurant. Top service delicious food.
91,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty good ramen.
Not too expensive with generous portions.
Generally packed. If you come in a group of more than 2 people, you'd better be early (6pm)"
92,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great great great ramen. Very busy though, so be there early and expect to wait a little outside. However, it has a pretty fast turnout."
93,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,a month ago,A very fulfilling ramen experience. Totally recommended.
94,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good soup but the noodles don‚Äôt soak up the good taste of the soup enough, they don‚Äôt have any taste in themselves. It has got a good potential to be a really good ramen place though."
95,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best lamens I had, ever! Really good, tasty and well prepared! The place is tiny, there was a wait time of about 30 minutes  when we arrived. Service is very good, and the prices are fair."
96,Fou Fow Ramen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ramen with no flavors. I can see everyone says it is good ramen but i did not liked it. I've got ramen tasteless. There is no reason to come here specially
97,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the top ramen places in Amsterdam. Standard portion is big enough even if you're quite hungry. I wish they had more tables outside.
98,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very good ramen and gyoza. The place amd service was really nice.
99,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,fantastic ramen and several varieties: the noodles and broth were both excellent...will definitely go back
100,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good ramen. The location in Centraal always seems to have a line. Try the eggplant appetizer. They have vegan options.
101,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Just go! Great ramen. Good price for Amsterdam. Small and cozy place. Nice staff.
P.s. might be busy."
102,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,a year ago,Yum! It‚Äôs my go to for Ramen in Amsterdam. Consistently delicious and fresh. There is a lovely variety of different dishes to choose from and they offer a chicken broth alternative to the pork broth with the Tori Lemon Ginger. Which is my ‚Ä¶

104,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,a month ago,Great ramen.
105,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A eye üëÄopening ramen experience! The miso was so meaty and flavoursome I'll never accept the cheap stuff in The Hague again!
106,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent ramen place. Be careful of the hours as it closes early. (21h) great staff and food.
107,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Amazing broth and the pan fried veggie dumplings are sooo tasty! Employees are incredibly welcoming and friendly.
108,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The ramen are absolutely excellent and service is quite quick!
109,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great authentic Japanese taste! Ramens are great. Definitely recommended
110,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and service at an affordable price, only slightly too hot inside. Perhaps due to their open kitchen set-up. 5* If they would enhance their ventilation."
111,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great ramen, very simple tasting (not too overwhelming), great service! Nice spot as well, a part of the massive trucks (?!?!) passing nearby from time to time (why they even let them idk). Not too busy!!!"
112,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly staff and delicious ramen! Pretty cozy and small but easy to find! This location does not have dessert, try the newer location for japanese dessert!"
113,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food for not that much money. Place is small and always packed, so make sure you are early or are able to wait a bit."
114,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I like their delicious ramen and good service.
115,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Awesome food and great staff though its really busy and they are not accepting reservations so if you plan to eat here prepare for long waiting on the line but its worth to wait
116,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Not quite as good as ramen we had in Japan but delicious especially on a cold wet day!
117,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Deliciously authentic Ramen option with vegetarian and vegan offerings. Quick and friendly service made the experience even better!
118,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice vegan selection, good food and friendly Staff"
119,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is probably some of the best ramen I have ever had. Super tasteful. Can also recommend the gyoza.
120,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best ramen in Amsterdam. Tan tan was really good, and actually not that spicy."
121,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Every time we come here, ramens are absolutely delicious!"
122,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Quick service.
A very cozy spot, perfect to eat with a couple friends.
The large portions are great value. ‚Ä¶"
123,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Small place but the food is great. Recommend the tonkotsu ramen
124,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best. Ramen. I‚Äôve. Ever. Had.

Coming from LA, we eat ramen quite often and I seriously have to say, this was ‚Ä¶"
125,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great raman. Nice location, be there early to have a sit outside,  very hot inside,  like you sit near the fire place"
126,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Most flavorful broth in Ams. Sometimes too much richness in flavor
127,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The original location. Always busy. Choose between Shio -,Tonkotsu -, Vegetarian -, Miso - or Tan Tan Men Ramen. Short opening hours though. Lunch: 1200-1500. Dinner: 1700-2100"
128,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,a year ago,If you‚Äôve ever tried ramen in Japan or any other authentic place you‚Äôll dislike this place. I added 2 extra stars because of the service and the price but the quality is tasteless and sad.
129,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place for a warm and quick bowl of ramen and a few other Japanese snacks.
130,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing Ramen at good prices. Expensive starters though, for the quantity of food on them, but very tasty and authentic."
131,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The only problem is having to be there early not to wait outside for tables. The ramen is worth it though!
132,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I loved the vibe. Had veggie ramen, which tasted good, but was lacking some depth in flavour. The chili oil wasn't really spicy. Maybe adjusted for western palate? Overall it was a pretty good experience."
133,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good ramen
Update 05/2020: They can do takeouts.  Donburi pretty good."
134,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,This place was recommended as the best place in Amsterdam to have Ramen Soup. I've been there twice - and I feel that the broth could be richer in flavour. My Japanese friend said the same. ‚Ä¶
135,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best ramen I have had. the place is quaint and buzzing with life. The service is friendly and we didn't wait long for the food either.
We started with the silk tofu which was absolutely delicious.  A nice enough ‚Ä¶"
136,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food and good service, recommended, greeting from Spain and thanks for all"
137,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,This place is always packed. Which makes sense since the noodles are very good!
138,Fou Fow Ramen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Not sure why this place gets rated so much as there are many better Ramen places in Amsterdam. Simply comes down to the fact that the broth is a little bland for me, not the depth of flavour you need in a good ramen. Noodles ok but again falls short for me."
139,Fou Fow Ramen, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"I am not the first one apparently to say it, but we were served by also the brunette lady and it was just painful to watch.. not a smile or even a thank you .. thankfully the food was great !"

141,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great Ramen! I especially recommend the Tan Tan Men.
142,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the tonkatsu classic and kimchi. Tasty soup base, soy marinated egg and sliced pork. The noodles tasted just a bit undercooked this time. Normally it's perfect. It brings back memories of the little ramen shop I ate at in Fukuoka late one night."
143,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good ramen. There's a waiting line in the evening and broth might be too thick / fat for some tastes, but it all worth experiencing quality ramen. Portions are super large while prices are very friendly."
144,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Small, deliciuos Ramen place... it‚Äôs worth waiting!!!"
145,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food's quality is amazing! Utterly delicious! The staffs are friendly and willing to make adjustments per your request (e.g., if you do not consume pork meats). We tried Tan Tan Ramen and it was a top notch Ramen! üëåüëåüëå ‚Ä¶"

148,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty ramen, only 1 vegan option though. If you add some extra sambal/hot sauce and sesame seeds it‚Äôs yummy, I enjoyed it. While eating though there‚Äôs a line with people waiting for a table, so don‚Äôt expect to have a long sit down dinner"
149,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Loved the ramen! Had the Miso ramen + gyozas and it was delicious. The restaurant is decorated very nicely and even though it was simple, its pleasant on the eye. Staff was friendly!"
150,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice ramen noodles. Cozy little place in a nice street, the staff is nice and they have authentic oriental drinks. You can taste that the quality of their food is high."
151,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Definitely my favourite ramen place in Amsterdam! I'd definitely recommend it!
152,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is somewhat ok, in fact you could even say it's tasty. However if you've ever eaten ramen in Japan then you'd know the taste is completely different to what it's supposed to taste. As an example this store's miso ramen is closer to a ‚Ä¶"

157,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We were so happy and excited to finally stumble upon this little ramen noodle house of deliciousness! FYI most of the restaurants were closed around 2-5 pm in AMS, Thank God not this one! Highly recommended their Tan Tan Ramen. (Forgot to take a pictures)"
158,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great place for some ramen. The taste was rich and I do believe that the ingredients used were either more western or modern. If you seek an exclusively authentic asian cuisine you might leave slightly disappointed? ‚Ä¶
159,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Their vegetarian/vegan ramen and dumplings are great! I had to ask to put less soy sauce the second time I went, simply because there was too much the first time. Cozy environment and authentic food, widely recommend it!"
160,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It's a cute small restaurant. If it's busy, you'll be asked to write your name in a list. In my opinion, the ramen was not the best... I tried the spicy and the classic ramen, and the classic ramen tasted just like chicken soup. The spicy was way better. Service is fast, the staff was super nice but they for sure were in a hurry."
161,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The staff is really nice and the food is served quick, but i wouldn't say the ramen itself is really good. Too heavy, the spicy ones are not  spicy at all. Good place for a quick bite if you're not too picky."

164,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent Ramen in a very cool vibe. Staffs are super friendly.
165,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A nice cozy place for a great Ranen meal. The Tan Tan Men is delicious although a bit spicy, but if you can handle that it's great! But it has nothing to the Miso Ramen. Creamy, a bit salty and it stimulates every taste but on your tongue. An great place to eat!"

170,Fou Fow Ramen, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Ramen is all right (no beef option) but staff not very friendly and the waiting line outside is kind of ridiculous. Chairs are very small and not comfortable. It's also quite small so for a quick eat all right but not for a comfy nice dinner experience.
171,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've had A LOT of ramen in Japan and this place lives up to the standard I'm used to there. From the texture of the noodles and the pork to the thick booth. I was actually surprised because I've heard the phrase ""authentic ramen"" before and ‚Ä¶"

Definitely recommended."
174,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice Ramen place in the middle of Jordaan. Prices are really decent and portions are generous. Might not fit the purist ramen lover definition though but definitely good place. Note that you should expect some waiting there as this ‚Ä¶

Great Ramen.  Local little, empty and untreated but fine.
You should also focus on aesthetics too.
Smiling and helpful staff."
178,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Was here on a busy evening for dinner and I couldn't recommend it more. The broth was piping hot and thick, and the noodles perfectly springy. The service was admittedly a bit slow, and it took a while for us to be served / get tap water etc. but the ramen makes it well worth the wait!"
179,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, good kitchen, tables and furniture are somewhat old/simplistic but that belongs to the atmosphere/style of the place. No reserving: You need to be earlt or put your name on a list and wait a bit. It's quick, fresh well made, and maybe not so suitable for big groups. Prices are on the low side. International Staff."

184,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,a year ago,Have been there some months ago and really loved  the food. Today I walked by and was surprised that the tables outside stand so close to each other. I would not feel comfortable to sit there at the moment for that reason.

192,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My favourite is Tan Tan Ramen. The taste was super delicious. I dont really eat pork and here you could order without pork broth or minced broth. The service is nice though the line is quite tricky. But its worth to wait!
193,Fou Fow Ramen, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Probably had too much expectations since reviews generally seemed full of praise. However having tried our first two bowls of ramen here, we were slightly disappointed. The broth was not as rich as we thought it would be (we ordered one ‚Ä¶"

Went to the original location and was redirected to the one across the bridge to avoid the waiting list. ‚Ä¶"
201,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice Ramen place in Amsterdam. Very rich broth of the miso, soysauce or pork broth. They also have a vegetarian option which is also quite nice.

208,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Authentic ramen. Vegetarian broths could use stronger flavours. Portions are massive. Side dishes are extraordinary, especially the sesame spinach (goma ae). Plum wine (with ice) is HIGHLY recommended. There is a waiting list to get into this place, do not let that deter you. Wait!"
209,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,5 years ago,It was really interesting. Glad they had a vegan option. I didn't realize all they had was giant bowls of noodles. I ended up getting a seat next to kitchen line and it was very hot over there and my mom's food came out boiling out. Also my food came out ten minutes after the other 2 had arrived.
210,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Came on a Thursday night and there was a small line. We waited for 10-15 minutes and got served very quickly as soon as we sat down. The ramen was awesome but I wasn't getting blown away. Nonetheless I would definitely come back next time im in the area.
211,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super authentic and tasty ramen!
212,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I'm in the search for the best ramen in town and to be honest, this is not the best ramen I have ever tried in Amsterdam. The broth is too thick and the noodle needs to be cooked a little bit longer."
213,Fou Fow Ramen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,they serve the best ramen in amsterdam. I've had a lot of bowls of ramen in several places in several countries.however I've never seen a place where this much good qualities' ramen is served out of asian countries.
214,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty broth, good ramen and delicious gyozas. We had to wait a little bit before there was place. Paid ‚Ç¨30 for two bowls of ramen and a dish of gyozas, which is a fair price."

221,Fou Fow Ramen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"From hidden gem with a few seats on the third floor of Toko Dun Yong, to two restaurants that are always packed. The ramen has become even better. My favorites are the spicy tantanmen and the tonkotsu classic. Don't forget a side dish of kimchi or gyoza!"

248,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,5 years ago,I should have paid more attention to the sino jap description. The ramen had bean sprouts and spinach in it and perhaps I am too traditional but those 2 ingredients don't belong in ramen in my opinion. Char siew was good though.

250,Fou Fow Ramen, 3 stars ,6 years ago,delicious food. service was not great. had to wait a long time to get our bill and then pay while lots of people waited for our table on a busy saturday. they need someone to better manage table turn around. guys next to us waited almost 15 minutes to pay their bill while there was a line out the door. seriously?
