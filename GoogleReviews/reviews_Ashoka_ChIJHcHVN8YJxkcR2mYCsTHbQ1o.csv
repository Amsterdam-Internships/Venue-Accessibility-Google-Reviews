4,Ashoka, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Nice Indian restaurant with friendly and responsive staff. Food is of large portion and very delicious. I recommend the chicken biryani which is served with a sort of yogurt sauce. Price is a bit high but understandable in this area.

15,Ashoka, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Really great meal out here. Staff were as attentive as could be expected for such a busy night. Food was excellent. Only complaint was the jarring nature of the 'birthday' music and light show played frequently for customers birthdays.

27,Ashoka, 1 star ,a month ago,"I had a dayvof my life until I arrived here

They have a very bad attention to their customers ‚Ä¶"
28,Ashoka, 3 stars ,3 months ago,The food is okay. The interior is modern and nice. The Nan bread and the Mango Lassi had too much sugar to my taste. Also the prices are rather high. You can get the same quality of food for half the price somewhere else.
29,Ashoka, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Great location in the center of Amsterdam. Some of the tastiest and best served Indian dishes I've had in a while, the sharing plates were ideal for our small party and couldn't be finished it was so filling."

39,Ashoka, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very nice Indian food! They all knew what is vegan and what is not (there are several vegan options). My daal was really delicious.
It's a bit on the pricey side but you get so much food - we were struggling to finish. The ambience was nice too!"
40,Ashoka, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The best Indian food we have ever eaten honestly a must visit when in Amsterdam. We only got takeaway on our last night but if we had found this gem sooner we would have gone more....superb
41,Ashoka, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Food - delicious
Service - phenomenal
Interior - clean and fancy ‚Ä¶"
42,Ashoka, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,They are Nepalese and NOT Indian. Nepalese restaurants have less understandings of Indian kitchen. At 3 visits they returned us saying they don‚Äôt have seats available. So one better can avoid this.
43,Ashoka, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Incredible food and experience. Beautiful restaurant with excellent service. Loved the Indian Chenin Blanc and the mixed bowls of veg and meat curries - overall a must visit if you like curries and tasty food üëåüèª
44,Ashoka, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The food was delicious and plenty. They had vegan options and the waiter was really helpful by showing which options are vegan friendly. I loved the ambiente and the staff was more than polite. You can expect to pay 20-30‚Ç¨ (including drinks) per person.

47,Ashoka, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"GREAT FOOD!! AWESOME and cozy restaurant that's open daily when we called in a panic, because another restaurant that we showed up to was closed, even though our Google search said that it would be open. Our shared meal was reasonably priced, and we had no room for dessert after dinner."
48,Ashoka, 5 stars ,a month ago,I tried prawns beryani and It was great. The food taste was great and the spicy level was acceptable (mild). The food was prepared and delivered very fast.
49,Ashoka, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Deluxe restaurant with premium ambiance and services.
Dim lights, indoor plant, aesthetic interior and multiple staffs to take care of guest needs promptly. ‚Ä¶"
50,Ashoka, 1 star ,6 months ago,"We chose to dine here after reading all the glorious reviews. I fail to comprehend how people called the dishes authentic. And to make the experience even worse, the service was extremely slow. It took about 15-20 minutes to get us our drinks, dessert menu and the bill. SAVE YOUR TIME AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"
51,Ashoka, 5 stars ,a month ago,Oooh the best ever Indian and Nepalese food I tried in my life 5 star it‚Äôs not enough for them must to try
52,Ashoka, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I really loved the food, and the atmosphere is very nice. I ordered to go because they were full. My takeout was packaged very carefully and wrapped in foil to keep it warm. Only drawback I see is that it is quite small so seating is ‚Ä¶"
53,Ashoka, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"This seems to be a pretty busy place, so you may not get a table if don't have a reservation. The food was ok and the waiters friendly. I really like that they have course options on the menu so you can sample a lot of different dishes. As far as flavor, not the best Indian I've had, hence the rating."

58,Ashoka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is excellent has loads of flavour. Being able to choose how spicy you want each dish is always a plus. The helpfulness of the staff is excellent and the service is great too, very prompt and efficient, but don't rush you while ‚Ä¶"
59,Ashoka, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Good place, humble staff , reasonable price but they should improve their hygiene. We found bunch of hair under at the bottom of papad offered in the beginning. Such a thing changes a delicious and nice food experience into to a disgusting one."
60,Ashoka, 1 star ,6 months ago,"We went in the evening, extremely poorly lit atmosphere. It was really difficult to even see the food. The price ratio was off the roof. 17 euro for daal for one person serving, are you kidding me ?  Not recommending it"
61,Ashoka, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Superb curry! Possibly best I've had! Extremely friendly staff, couldn't find our reservation at first but found us a table quickly. Lots of choice of food including the classics, food was cooked to perfection and we were even asked how hot ‚Ä¶"

71,Ashoka, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Was here with my brother the other day. Sat inside and it was amazing. Tall waitress with her hair tied up was brilliant. Decided to come again and brought my girlfriend here as it was the first time she visited me in Amsterdam. We sat ‚Ä¶
72,Ashoka, 1 star ,5 months ago,Food is the nice but keep on mind that time between your ordering the food and you realllly  getting the food ü•ò not less than an hour and half. Not worth to wait if you hungry üòä.

75,Ashoka, 1 star ,7 months ago,I‚Äôve had a lot of take out from this place and it was always great. My last dining experience was a HUGE disappointment. I‚Äôll only mention the highlights. Allergies and food intolerance should be taken SERIOUSLY and it was NOT the case. ‚Ä¶
76,Ashoka, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We came here for take out after reading the reviews. Rating it 5 stars even before we eat the food. Service was splendid. They offered us drinks on the house while we wait for the food. The place is buzzing with happy eaters and smiley ‚Ä¶

84,Ashoka, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"It took 25 minutes to order, another 40 to get our food and when we didn't finish the staff made remarks about how much we had ate. In total we were there for 2.5 hours and skipped dessert just to wait 20 minutes for the bill, the food was delicious but almost wasn't worth the wait at that point"
85,Ashoka, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Here you find tasty food with the right spices. They have enough choices for vegans. Skip the homemade ice cream to expensive and not good. Friendly hard working staff.
86,Ashoka, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good taste for Indian cuisines good service as well. Taste is near about Indian taste. They serve both veg and non veg but you can find many options in vegiterian. I had been thrice in my week visit of Netherlands. They have two branches ‚Ä¶

117,Ashoka, 3 stars ,a year ago,"This typical Nepalese food is made up of various small bowls, containing chicken, vegetables, rice. The bread on the right side is garlic flavored.

The food was also amazing, it was very flavorful, some could say spicy even, but we found it amazing overall. Would recommend to anyone."
130,Ashoka, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Ambience and service was great, but food lacked flavor. Seems like the chef doesn‚Äôt know how to use spices if there are no chilies to mask the flavor. I had Vegetable korma and Mutter paneer. Both were much tastier and flavorful at other Indian restaurants."

139,Ashoka, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic restaurant. The best Indian restaurant I've ever been to ... And my English husband agrees! Lovely flavors.

152,Ashoka, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"If you like Indian food, you won't be disappointed. Well, not terribly. You may want to press the waiter to get the level of spiciness high enough, if that's your thing. Their notion of spicy is quite a few degrees off."
153,Ashoka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This restaurant is great. Of course, the food is good but I was very touched by the service here. My mother was feeling very sick after a particularly weary day of traveling, and couldn't eat any food.
