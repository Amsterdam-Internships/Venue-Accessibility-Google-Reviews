1,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,a month ago,Wonderful cocktails in a beautiful location. The whiskey sour is on point. The egg white foam was perfection. You can count on good service and well crafted drinks at this establishment. Highly recommend.
2,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great place for a whiskey cocktail and if you are hungry you have a choice of some nice small Asian style dishes, on Tuesday tacos. It's a place with a very international vibe so don't expect a lot of Dutch being spoken."
3,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,a month ago,"You would think that only having whisky would get boring after a while, but the staff at JD always finds new drinks for me to try that expand my understanding of what whisky can taste like. They have a great selection of craft beers on tap. The kitchen is amazing (even for me as a vegetarian). Try their spiked cider in winter. <3"

7,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 4 stars ,a month ago,A good nook in the Jordaan area. Wide selection of whiskey from around the world with craft brews from local breweries. You get what you pay for.
8,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Widest selection of whiskey I've ever seen in one location. Try something new neat or on the rocks or explore their awesome cocktail menu. The food is fantastic also if you get hungry after tasting a few whiskeys. The owner and staff couldn't have been nicer!
9,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Huge fan of this whisky bar. The menu is full of drinks that will become your favorites and the people working there are friendly and welcoming. …
10,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 1 star ,a year ago,Back here after 2 or 3 years. This place used to be a hidden gem with great drinks and cocktails. Success and tourism must've gone to it's head. A cocktail is 16 euro's! Drink is 4 Sips ~70 ml. Disappointing to see over-tourism chip away at authenticity.
11,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Sure, certain that things can be improved, but I'm a big supporter of the concept. …"
12,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic place. A mesmerising selection of whisky from all over the world. Highly recommend to eat here too, the sharing dishes here are simply amazing. + Nicest bartender in the city (who really knows what he’s talking about)."

14,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Expensive mediocre cocktails. Staff weren't helpful and at some point a little bit aggressive. The toilets didn't have soap or paper towels.
15,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice spot to enjoy a dram of whisky. Good selection of drams too! Have both the bourbon and malt styles. Also have whiskies from Australia and Japan to mix it up. Nice, laid back atmosphere so you can enjoy your whiskies as well. If …"

17,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"How can this place be so expensive?
I understand that they focus only on Whiskeys, which I personally love, but the price is just unjustified.
A glass of Lagavulin 16: almost 60€? 🤷‍♂️"
18,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Extensive selection of whisky's and a nice range of rotating craft beers.  The vegetarian quesadilla is great.
19,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"The friendliest barman you'll ever find, mouth-watering cocktails and tasty treats.

34,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Obviously a huge assortment of whiskeys and yummy cocktails,  but stay for the food! The Korean beef tacos are not to be missed, they are the ultimate umami experience.  The kimchi gyoza are also super lekker.  Cozy atmosphere and friendly staff."
35,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Decent place with a wide selection of beers and whiskeys. They had a lot of standard stuff but also some one of Scotch that were interesting. The service is prompt and unpretentious. It’s not a bad place for a drink.
36,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This has the best whiskies in the Netherlands. It is very friendly, and the place to be if you like whisky (they have loads of it!) They make a stunning ""Old Fashioned"" (my favourite cocktail), and they also have good beers for when you …"
37,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing, original, whiskey-inspired food, lots of whiskeys to choose from, good ambiance. Lots of original single malt based cocktails too.

44,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fave low key cozy place for great cocktails and whiskey. Staff are knowledgeable and always awesome and help with selecting new whiskey to try :) food is good. But they always sell out of vegetarian specials 😭
45,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Could get pricey depending on your taste. Closes at 1:00AM. But the bare keep is exceptionally knowledgeable. Do ask for some recommendations and a history of the bottle, you'll benefit surprised what you can learn. I wish they didn't have to measure the pour though. Overall a must stop after dinner for a night cap."

52,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,We stopped here for whiskey. Sitting at the bar you can see the great selection of options and we chose to each try a sampling of 4 whiskeys. The Kentucky Derby was a selection of Bourbon and the Michter's and aged Jim Beam were especially delicious. €17 for the sample was a great price.
53,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"It offers a large variety of whiskys and a great ambience to enjoy it, background music, perfect for a chat with a friend. Not very crowded. Quite pricey though, but it's whisky after all. Didn't try any food."

61,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Extensive whiskey menu, pretty friendly bartenders who will engage and recommend you your next dram. Got pretty crowded and tight in the bar on a Friday night, to be expected. But good vibes even if you're alone for a drink."
62,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Popped in for one and ended up staying for 3 hours in this lovely bar.

Will definitely be back if I'm ever in the 'Dam again."

65,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic selection of whiskey to choose from. Have the staff help you out with a choice. You may be judged if you ask for ice with your whiskey, but they wont kick you out. Science has proven that ice is ok with whiskey, so do what you will. It IS a whiskey bar, so don't go in there asking for a gin and tonic."
66,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Wide variety of whiskey as well as curiously curated food menu. Relaxing atmosphere with quality music. Highly recommended if you want to rewind. A little on the pricey side, but it is worth it."
67,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The waitress was mean and rude when I asked her for a flavoured whisky, such as vanilla, honey, whatever. And she made me the most expensive drink with no flavour, pretty dull and charged too much. Won't go back, it's not that great."
68,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I loved my visit, Felix the bar tender was very welcoming and very friendly, the bar itself is very well maintained and with extremely nice ambiance, the whisky collection is WoW and pricing is somehow okay ... For real a 5/5 without any compliments"
69,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Two guys with laid back caps were bartending in this up scale whiskey bar. I was disappointed that they didn't offer a pipette to put a few drops of water into the whiskey. We also had to wait a little too long to get served. But the whiskey itself tasted great!
70,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The owner took care of us. Excellent service. I had an old fashioned which was excellent. Decent bar food as well... The turkey burger was flavorful and the sweet potatoes fries were delish!

74,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Brilliant whiskey selection (duh), decent bites & a nice vibe. Music is often a miss for me as I don't expect to hear some pretty intense EDM when I head to a whiskey bar, but that's pretty subjective."
75,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Such a cool place with awesome atmosphere and marvelous whisky. JD and his people are excellent hosts as well. Thank you from Runewood Denmark!

85,J.D. William's Whisky Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Pintxos worth sharing and a wall of whiskeys to help you along the way. Don't go for the beers. Be bold and go with a whiskey for the appetizers, the main and the dessert."
