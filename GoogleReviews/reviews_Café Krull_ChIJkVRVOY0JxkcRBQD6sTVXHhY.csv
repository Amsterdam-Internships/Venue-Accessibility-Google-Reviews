📝 The waitresses were very friendly all the time and advised us on what to …"
1,Café Krull, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I enjoyed this bar very much!!! It was none pretentious. We had a great waitress. She was kind, funny, and attentive."
2,Café Krull, 1 star ,7 months ago,"The blonde waiter is very rude, made everyone wait for 25 minutes before bringing our drinks and complaining to his boss after we pointed out we ordered before some customers that are to his liking. A real travesty of a place in general. Cannot recommend this to anyone."
3,Café Krull, 1 star ,7 months ago,"If you want to be treated like Dirt , please visit this hole , most unfriendly service in de pijp , they have no respect for customer 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
4,Café Krull, 3 stars ,10 months ago,nice terrace opposite a park near the street market at Cuypstraat. Very limited menu (not even fries hence the 3 stars instead of 4) but a good place for a cold beer. The young lady waiting on the tables was overworked as she was the only one around but always had a pleasant smile.

6,Café Krull, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely cafe,very nice and relaxing, the staff are fantastic,dog friendly,great coffee, snacks,wine and beers. Great Magazines and newspapers available."
7,Café Krull, 1 star ,3 years ago,"2 x waited outside for more than 20 mins with no one being outside - no one has ever approached me. Elderly lady with grey hair working there had a seat and started smoking, like there was no one to serve. Girls behind the bar made eye …"
8,Café Krull, 1 star ,4 years ago,Two times already the drinks (one time coffee) were wrong and not what we ordered. The waitress didn't want to change it and we also got a complain that we should see that the cafe is too busy. None of the three times I've been there the stuff was polite.
9,Café Krull, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The service was not up to standard. When my friend ordered the tosti it did not come with a napkin. Their mint tea is overpriced (3 euros), and when I asked just for a hot water refill, the waitress rudely replied with ""Are you being …"
10,Café Krull, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Sat down with a group of four outside. Waited for 30 minutes and no waiter took our order. Went inside to ask if someone could come around, they said they would come in a second. Waited for 10 more minutes and nobody showed up. Changed to Boca's Park just aside of it and got served within 2 minutes from a friendly waiter."
11,Café Krull, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great atmosphere and service, especially Nic the bartender. A++ would trade again"
12,Café Krull, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I love this place, though I'm still not sure as to why. Typical selection of beers in a nice part of the city. Perhaps you may have a sort of empanada from the Tjin's, then stroll over to the Krull for a pint. If you're a Spanish speaker, …"

14,Café Krull, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The place is okay but the staff was very unfriendly. When I asked what kind of draftbeers they served, the girl answered on a very irritated manner saying: get up and look for it yourself. …"
15,Café Krull, 1 star ,7 years ago,Usually the people working there were always really nice and child friendly. That is why I was incredibly disappointed that now there is a guy working there that is not at all child friendly and on top of it he is extremely unfriendly. Is …
16,Café Krull, 3 stars ,2 years ago,It's just ok. It's in a popular bar and restaurant area and thus its prices are a bit high. The beer selection is mediocre. It does have great outdoor seating.
17,Café Krull, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I thought I would try this place out as I heard good things about it. It was pretty nice, staff were friendly and the beer menu was pretty decent. Prices average for the Amsterdam area. Would definitely go back if I was in the area."
18,Café Krull, 2 stars ,8 years ago,Unfriendly service from the bar staff. I ordered a tomato soup which I assumed would be vegetarian but which arrived with meatballs in it. (This was not mentioned on the menu!) When I explained the mistake they took it away but left it on …
19,Café Krull, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"when a friend told me the coffee was atrocious, i took it as an exaggeration but this is probably the worst coffee i have been served in A'dam in a decade, which is a shame as teh cafe is an excellent respite from teh market and infinitely …"
