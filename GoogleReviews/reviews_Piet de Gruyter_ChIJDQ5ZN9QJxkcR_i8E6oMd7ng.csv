0,Piet de Gruyter, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"A sunny day on the terras is not to be missed at Piet de Gruyter...this popular local hangout brings a good vibe at all times, any day of the week. Good spot for a quick lunch, and to meet up with friends and watch the football/soccer - only when AJAX us playing of course!"
1,Piet de Gruyter, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Very nice location, fast and friendly service. Wide selection of cocktails & beers. Definitely recommended when sun is shining!"
2,Piet de Gruyter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Clean and crisp, friendly and smart,  the Gruyter is place you can either spend outside in the sun, or inside to enjoy the air conditioning.
+Arcade on lower level â€¦"
3,Piet de Gruyter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good burger and fries just out of the frier! Good vibe as well a bunch of locals watching the footy.
4,Piet de Gruyter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to hang out and watch soccer. Young crowd. Laid back joint. Service slow compared to USA, a place not to be in a rush and enjoy conversations"
5,Piet de Gruyter, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Great location, food good, service was a bit slow and they didnâ€™t clean the table between customers"
6,Piet de Gruyter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to grab a bite to eat. My friend and I were looking for a while for a place to eat at 12. There weren't a lot of places close by that were open. Decided to come here and ordered a burger and fries. Best burger I've had in Amsterdam to date. Hands down. Was pleasantly surprised.
7,Piet de Gruyter, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice laid back bar with food and drinks, nice furniture, nice music and friendly service. We've had croque madame (8/10) and fried eggs and ham on bread (7/10), all good and fairly priced."
8,Piet de Gruyter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good eetcafÃ© friendly staff and mild prices.. Nice place overall
9,Piet de Gruyter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good vibe, many special beers, decent terrace, next to westerpark, my go to spot if there's a soccer match I don't want to miss. Perfect if you'd like to avoid the touristic sports bars."
10,Piet de Gruyter, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best bar in the Staatsliedenbuurt with big a sunny terrace. Super friendly staff and tasty lunch. They make good cocktails as well!
11,Piet de Gruyter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Five corners with narrow streets, each with a restaurant and this one gives out onto a street terrace. Inside, limited seating requires you to call ahead but no restrictions on the menu which includes two daily specials. We tried both and â€¦"
12,Piet de Gruyter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The staff were very friendly and helpful explaining the menu in English.  My white fish was wonderful, with tasty fresh vegetables and chewy bread.  We enjoyed playing Triominos before and after our meal."
13,Piet de Gruyter, 4 stars ,4 years ago,A great cafe a stone's throw away from the park. All day sunshine (weather not guaranteed ;) ) Friendly staff and a selection of beers will have you sitting in the sun and chatting with friends. The food looks great but I've not tried it yet myself
14,Piet de Gruyter, 4 stars ,4 years ago,One of the few places where they know what a pastis is and how to serve it :) Nice service with an handsom waiter :) I had just a drink but it's a place where i could go back for sure. Decoration inside doesn't match the beautiful retro tailed entrance ; pity.
15,Piet de Gruyter, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great atmosphere, quiet on Saturday and Sunday morning, we can sit by the windows and get some sun, the food if good as well. Probably the only place in Amsterdam to have Super Bock beer."
16,Piet de Gruyter, 2 stars ,2 years ago,We found the service very slow and amateurish - even with three waiters/bar men on duty and hardly any customers. Our salad was OK but very small for the price.

18,Piet de Gruyter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,If I could give more stars I would. We were staying in a nearby hotel on westerpark and popped in here for lunch - we weren't disappointed! Outstanding food and service. One of the best meals we had in amsterdam would highly recommend
