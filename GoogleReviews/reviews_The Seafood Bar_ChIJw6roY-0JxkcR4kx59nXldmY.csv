138,The Seafood Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Probably one of the best seafood bars we’ve been to. Even though the place is huge, it gets really packed especially during lunchtime.

145,The Seafood Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fabulous food.  We were there lateish so they were running out of most crustacean items, but we thought the fingerlings almost melt in your mouth, the crab cakes were excellent and couldn't get enough of their roasted potatoes.  I also had their oyster bloody mary that was fresh and really hit the spot."
146,The Seafood Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We don’t have great experience with the restaurant, I made the reservation and I was late however I did call the restaurant and told them I was late. When I arrived at the restaurant the guy told me I was late and have to be on the waiting …"
147,The Seafood Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of several around Amsterdam. Excellent quality and probably the best service in the city. Never had a bad meal at any of them. Pays to book, although they do have a walk in and leave your name policy, but be prepared to wait. The …"
148,The Seafood Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic oysters, mixed grill and starters"
149,The Seafood Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The Seafood Bar was pretty good. No real complaints about the food or the service, but the price point isn’t exactly on par with what I would’ve expected. The interior is quite nice, also."
150,The Seafood Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We went here for dinner but would probably say it’s more of a place of lunch. Tables were very close and felt a bit squished. Is literally a bar place but again would recommend as a lunch place. Food was good, wouldn’t say it would be a …"
151,The Seafood Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Wonderful ambiance, feels like you're in Saint-Tropez. Food is amazing! Would recommend going for lunch, but for dinner is also a perfect venue."
152,The Seafood Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious seafood and amazing service!
I’ve eaten here many times and had my 27th birthday celebration here. The staff was very attentive and made me a custom dessert on the spot, due to my food allergies! :)"

154,The Seafood Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice designed an clean restaurant with for sure the best seafood in town! Good service and a nice selection of wines. Amazing for both lunch and diner.
155,The Seafood Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very hip place! The oysters and the king crab were  amazing. Wine pairing is suggested in the menu which is super nice. The vearity plateaux to share could also be adapted for 3 and every one were full! We had the desert cocktails ""Scroppino"" and it was very good."
156,The Seafood Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love this place! Soups and shrimp are my to go meals, the seafood platter is also great! great wines, and sides are also delicious. Recommend a reservation."

158,The Seafood Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Always smiling crews, well designed interior with lots of daylight from the roof. …"
159,The Seafood Bar, 2 stars ,5 years ago,I love how this place looks!  The cold smoked fish platter was very nice and the mixed grill platter looked amazing BUT! The fish was way too overcooked and seemed not so fresh. The lobster and shrimps were like rubber and the rest of the fish were falling apart :(
160,The Seafood Bar, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"We ordered a big plate of grilled seafood with fish, shell fish and lobster. The clan of the lobster was undercooked!!! And the grilled was nothing impressive. 70+€ for the plate, I am sure you can find something better. Anyway, Holland is not a country famous for food, neither seafood."
161,The Seafood Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Service is a little slow, but very friendly and accommodating. Good selection of European seafood. The menu doesn’t change much but prices are reasonable and food presentation is adequate."

165,The Seafood Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place but a bit expensive for the quality they propose. I mean the food is not bad, but it's not incredible either. And the price is definitely high. The place design is nice though. Service as well."
166,The Seafood Bar, 3 stars ,5 years ago,I keep trying this place hoping I'll order the right main dish and it'll be great but so far it hasn't happened. Fish is often over cooked and sauces are overloaded with butter. The starters or small dishes are better. Salads are also just ok.
167,The Seafood Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,The dungeons crab is undercooked. The cold crustaceans taste over cooked and shells are soggy. The smoked mackerel is not smoked enough to really be good. The cold shell fish must be stored for a long time. The lobster soup has little flavor or lobster. Do not go I’m sure it could be an off day but not worth the money to find out.
168,The Seafood Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fresh seafood here is just to die for. Good thing we didn't come here during lunch hour, so no queue, not much waiting for the food. Fresh and tasty. Tho a bit on the pricey side, it is worth every cent."

Go get yourself a new job cuz this is just unfair to guests paying for service!
Overall: service is always bad, seafood is ok"
172,The Seafood Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food and service
173,The Seafood Bar, 5 stars ,5 months ago,One of my favorite restaurant in Amsterdam!!
174,The Seafood Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If I'm looking for a fishy treat, this is my place!  Go for one of the stacked options, fruits of the sea, the cooked option or a mix of the two.  Very spectacular.  Can get busy."
175,The Seafood Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Loved the  food but the staff are not very friendly and we had our 11 month old baby and we asked specifically for a baby chair when we made a reservation but when we arrived they said the chair was occupied and that we can put her on the couch! Which was not a practical suggestion I wouldn’t go there again with my baby
176,The Seafood Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, service and atmosphere. Try the seafood combo platter with a nice glass of wine. They serve delicious bread and butter, kids loved it."

189,The Seafood Bar, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I had the opportunity to pop in here during a brief trip to Amsterdam. The name suggested that it might be a market for fresh sea food (which I can never resist looking into) but to my delight, it is also a restaurant with all the goodies …"
