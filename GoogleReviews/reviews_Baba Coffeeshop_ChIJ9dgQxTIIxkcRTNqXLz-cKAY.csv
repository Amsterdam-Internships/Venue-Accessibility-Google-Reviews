2,Baba Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Service was great. Super friendly staff. Had the sunset sherbet and a cappuccino. The sunset was a great smoke - dutch grown to perfection. I am a big fan of the vaporizer in this place.

6,Baba Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly service, well looked after and the guy working there did everything he could to accommodate us, including switching the TV to the boxing. Can't fault the place, nice bud, relaxing atmosphere, will definitely be back again. It was a little bit out of the way for us to get to but was worth it. Thanks from Scotland."

10,Baba Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice and comfy Coffeeshop close to the Yays apartments. Not centrally located in Amsterdam but therefore also not that crowded. Perfect if you want to take a seat and relaxüëå
11,Baba Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had planned to visit this coffee shop and it was also recommended by the people at the Cannabis College.  Very good quality gear and a pleasant and relaxed smoking room. ‚Ä¶
12,Baba Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Small out of the way coffeeshop mainly frequented by locals, limited choice of hash and bud but good prices and quality. Vapes on the tables are the best, water cooled and beautiful to look at. Staff friendly and helpful. Coffee is really good."
13,Baba Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Taste, elegance and refinement. 5* for not crowding the place with all kinds of stuff. Music is for all tastes. They have a separated smoking area where you can also smoke tobacco. Least but not last the staff is very nice and helpful. Will surely return&recommend for your moment of relax."
14,Baba Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Staff was nice, but face value, I bought a pure pre-roll & the quality of the marijuana was absolutely deplorable. I'm unsure if I was given it because I look like a dumb tourist, but the quality was absolutely unacceptable."
