0,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"The food is very delicious but I would only give 3-4 stars because they have three udon dishes  that you can order in a vegan version which is nice but their classic udon dish non vegan version is 16,50 with this  you get shrimp tempura ‚Ä¶"
1,Fou Fow Udon, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Tasty bowl of udon - suitable to eat all winter! We had Fou Fow Classic Udon, udon served with shrimp tempura, onsen egg (slow cooked, runny egg), tofu, spring onions, daikon (radish). ‚Ä¶"
2,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"I don‚Äôt know about you, but sometimes you need a break from ramen and UDON is the best! My boyfriend and I had the Niku Udon Classic which was the bomb (beef was tender and had a lot of flavor) and Rayu Udon was delicious! The wasabi mayo that was with the Kara-age chicken was freaking crunchy delicious üòãüòãüòã"
3,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"No frills, a hot bowl of authentic Japanese udon for a quick fix in Amsterdam. Order for additional chilli if you want some additional kick!"
4,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great noodle place. The broth was amazing, meat as well. Quality food, super friendly stuff, the location was cool and welcoming. Totally recommend!! üíØüíØ"
5,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Amazing location. Very authentic udon. Especially it‚Äôs quite fresh. The view of canals make the dining experience quite nice. The service is very friendly.
6,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"My boyfriend and i went in this little place back in 2019 during a vacation, and we came back this year in Novembrer.
Everything is good, the food, the price, the atmosphere, we are totally in love with this restaurant!"
7,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The first proper Udon place in Amsterdam. It's by the same people that run Fou Fow Ramen so of course they understand good broth. The tempura could be crisper but the beef noodle bowl was really amazing. Quite expensive for Udon but Amsterdam IS in the midst of a Japanese noodle arms race that is driving up prices everywhere.
8,Fou Fow Udon, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The place is a bit small but nice. The service is good and waitresses very nice. I took udon with carry, carrots and fried pork (it was supposed to be with fried chicken but they ran out of it). The udon are home made and indeed they tasted ‚Ä¶"
9,Fou Fow Udon, 1 star ,3 months ago,"I am very disappointed by the dinner I had there. Was expecting an excellent udon soup, however it was very salty and very sad to only see one topping. The tofu was mushy, and you need to pay an extra to be able to have chilli oil. ‚Ä¶"
10,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I went to Fou Fow Udon for dinner with a friend today. The restaurant doesn't accept reservations, so we tried our luck at 18:30 and there were plenty of seats available so we could walk right in and seat ourselves. (They also had a ‚Ä¶"
11,Fou Fow Udon, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Honestly I don't get the hype, I was super excited to go there but I was let down. The extra supplements are overpriced and the noodles are too thick and hard too chew on. Soup tasted like basic powdered udon soup you get at the oriental shop. They ran out of all types of drinks as well. Staff was nice tho."
12,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great noodle place. The texture is the right balance between chewy and soft. The flavours are good and balanced though not as intense as i expected. Seems a little toned down to fit the local palatte. Still delicious. The places is quirky and the staff is great.
13,Fou Fow Udon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The handmade udon itself was on point. A bit chewy with a nice texture. I had it with the spicy soup and karage chicken with some salad on top. The salad and karage chicken do not belong in a soup unless served separately- in no time it all ‚Ä¶
14,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,8 months ago,We tried their Udon and tempura and both were very good. The service was also good.
15,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the better Japanese foodspots in Amsterdam. The homemade (well, store-made) udon soup, service and vibe are all on point. ‚Ä¶"
16,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Yummy homemade udon noodles accompanied with slice beef or tempura prawn.  Tempura is crispy fried with super thin batter. Super yummy and well done.
17,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,a year ago,Fou Fow was a great find in Amsterdam. The udon tastes exactly like in japan. I will come back.
18,Fou Fow Udon, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Not impressed, the soup was overpriced for what you get and the broth was very salty without a lot of flavour. I am pretty disappointed. Staff also were disinterested and seemed like they were waiting for the shift to end. Overrated, overpriced, and throughly underwhelming. Won‚Äôt be back!"
19,Fou Fow Udon, 1 star ,a year ago,"The food is quite good, but there is something I strongly dislike: there is an oily smell throughout the restaurant from the deep frying operations. Somehow their ventilation system is not able to cope. I have been here twice, months apart, ‚Ä¶"
20,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"After trying it once, I became a regular. Fresh udon, absolutely delicious and plenty of options to choose from. Staff is friendly and service is fast."
21,Fou Fow Udon, 1 star ,4 months ago,"It might have been the wrong evening. Many things from the menu were not available. Tempura was disappointing, raw, thick slices of vegetables in a bland batter. Tiny portion of noodles in the soup. Staff careless, everyone seemed to wait for the evening to be over, including us. Won't be coming back."
22,Fou Fow Udon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Was starving late night in Amsterdam, I was craving for some noodle soup. We went to a ramen place nearby tjis Udon place before but they still have a queue so we went here without any expectations. However, I was quite pleased with the ‚Ä¶"
23,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fou Fow Udon was a really nice place to have lunch. The restaurant has tables for two up to ten people and a long couch with cool small tables for private dining facing the restaurant. The Udon noodles were great. I took the Niku Udon ‚Ä¶

25,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,I really mean it when I say this was the best udon I‚Äôve had in my entire life !
26,Fou Fow Udon, 1 star ,3 months ago,"How rude! Unacceptable service.
The guy who was checking the vaccination certificate was being so demanding and rude. I don‚Äôt care if some people were messing around and faking their QR codes, ‚Ä¶"
27,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,6 months ago,One of the few udon restaurants in the Netherlands. Tasty broths and the cold udon dish is the best. Unfortunately prices are a bit high. ‚Ä¶
28,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing Udon dishes!
Went for the Niku and was unbelievably good...
Will visit again to try more dishes!"
29,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Best Udon in Amsterdam, full stop.

Maybe even the best Udon outside of Japan. ‚Ä¶"
30,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"March 2020, cold and rainy outside (...It was a dark and stormy night).
I randomly found this place roaming around 9 streets. Great discovery. Incredible food, friendly staff and fair prices. Highly recommended"
31,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"This is the best Udon I had in a long time! Cheap and delicious :)

33,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,a year ago,super nice udon restaurant. best fresh udon in Amsterdam
34,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Went there because Fou Fow Ramen on Elandsgracht was closed.
Good & tasty udon. Nice terrasse by Prisengracht Canal. Service was great even if it was new staff."
35,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice texture of Udon üçú and broth but just to limited of Udon choices.
36,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Class is good but normal. Curry katsu is Good but normal. Definitely should try Rayu. Amazing favor and textures. Super recommended!!

39,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,10 months ago,Very good food and reasonably-priced.
40,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely traditional Udon, very tasty and very well prepared. Ate Zaru (Cold) Udon and it was delicious! Recommend to anyone needing a good udon fix! Lovely waitress too who treated us very well :)"
41,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We stumbled upon this place and thank God we did, this was the best food we have eaten in our stay in Amsterdam. The broth was exquisite, the noodles were firm. This was definitely a sexy dish, in a place that the service was attentive without being obtrusive. Well done guys, we will be back."
42,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Oh my gosh! I've accidentally discovered this place walking in the neighborhood. Since I'm a big fond of soups, needless to say I had to come back there. And I wasn't disappointed at all. So far it's the best udon I have found in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
43,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Good udon place for a quick lunch. Staff knowledgeable
44,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best place for noodles in town! These guys always give the best of what they got! The food is divine and the staff is super sweet and friendly! The place is suitable for date and small groups. ‚Ä¶
45,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good food experience :-). Udon very nice firmness, and texture, picks up the taste of the broth very well. Broth is rich in taste and not greasy.
Udon is one of my favorite food and i see many happy lunch and dinners on the horizon visiting this restaurant."

48,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Udon, nice atmphosphere very kind crew üëçüèª"
49,Fou Fow Udon, 1 star ,a year ago,"Ordered food from Fou Fow via ubereats, half of the order was missing (1x curry katsu udon,3x onsen takago, and 1x gyoza). Driver seemed to have taken food out of the bags, which were torn, seal was missing from Fou Fow. Restaurant denied ‚Ä¶"
50,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Right after I heard that Fou Fow has opened Udon place, as Udon lover I had to check it out immediately, and I was not disappointed. Same good taste and quality noodles with deep tasty broth. Would like to have more choices of Udons so I could try all, and hope they would come up with ice udon for summer days :-)"
51,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, nice decor and ultra very friendly staff. Highly recommendable"
52,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The food was sooo good. We loved the udon dishes. I can fully recommend it.
53,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great restaurant. Friendly staff and AMAZING  Udon. They don't offer a huge range of choices, but that's it's strength. A good handful of Udon dishes, cooked to perfection. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
54,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super nice place. Classic udon and chicken gyoza are very tasty!
55,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great flavoured broth, well textured and cooked udon, great atmosphere and attentive staff. Tempura was also light and not very oily. Delicious Wakame salad that was well seasoned. Most importantly, didn‚Äôt feel like I was dying of thirst due to Ajinomoto overload. Hard to fault. Highly recommend."
56,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Just have lunch with my colleague who used to live in Japan and we had a blast! Perfect udon consistency and delicious broth. They've really reminded me of an unbelievable udon experience I had in Tokyo a couple of years ago :)
57,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Tasty Udon with big portions.
58,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Oh my goodness so good!!! You won‚Äôt be disappointed - friendly & attentive staff, quick service, and absolutely delicious udon!! I don‚Äôt know how they do it, but the broth with the Niku Udon Basic was almost buttery... just wonderful."
59,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fou Fow Udon is everything! Good food for fair prices, japanese ambience and very friendly staff. The Udons are made fresh in front of your eyes with this crazy big machine. Perfect place to go to slurp some soup!"
60,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I think I‚Äôve tried at least 4 or 5 different udon dishes here so far and they are all excellent! Asahi on tap, the edamame is great and plenty, staff is friendly and nice... Excellent place."
61,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Fantastic place for a real udon soup. There are several options also suitable for vegans, and you get served pretty quickly."
62,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"If you can get a seat here, count yourself lucky.  More often than not, the place is completely packed and, what's more, reservations are not accepted. ‚Ä¶"
63,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"First time here the udon was perfect. Second time (today) the soup base was extremely salty that my tongue got numb at the end....
So, I guess it's not very stable...."
64,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Good food, good service. Part of the order a little slow but was well worth the wait"
65,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice idea to make the udon noodles inside the restaurant where you can watch all the process from the flour to the finished  fresh made noodles. The place is very cozy and nicely decorated.
66,Fou Fow Udon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good udon place, nice vibe."
67,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome udon ! Highly recommended for an Udon experience in Amsterdam! Great atmosphere and nice people! Went for dinner and found a surprisingly true experience!

72,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food, friendly service and nice surroundings"
73,Fou Fow Udon, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Broth was cold, egg white not done - too expensive for what you get!"
74,Fou Fow Udon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The noodles were good but the flavour combinations were a little odd to me and competing with each other: caramelized beef with seaweed with pickled ginger was a little much ...
75,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious and our waiter was very nice, which made the whole experience very pleasant. Nice seating outside as well."
76,Fou Fow Udon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious zaru udon, noodles are nicely firm !
