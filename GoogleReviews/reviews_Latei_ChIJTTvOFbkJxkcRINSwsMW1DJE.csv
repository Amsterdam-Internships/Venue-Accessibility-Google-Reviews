15,Latei, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"In chinatown, very central, face to this beautiful temple. This small cafe experience was perfect! Good Chai Latte (one of my best try!), really nice cheesecake.

42,Latei, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"This cafe is everything I thought I wouldn't like. But it may be my favorite ever. It sells beautiful lamps, trinketry and furniture. They have very reasonable pricing, friendly service and a brilliant cappuccino. A must see. (Seriously, if I lived here I'd currently be arranging a way to move in.)"
43,Latei, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The absolute best in Amsterdam. It is always busy, more so at lunch, but don't miss an opportunity to stop in and say hi to Elvis if you are in town. Definitely grab a cappuccino, and my personal favorite is the dutch goat cheese sandwich on a fresh croissant!"
44,Latei, 5 stars ,9 years ago,Loved this place. The interior is really retro and takes you back in time. The owner has been running this already more than 18 years and he clearly still loves what he does. Also the fact that all the furniture is for sale is awesome. …

50,Latei, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My go-to cafe on the Zeedijk. Nice people, good coffee, interesting cakes. Seating on the street if the weather is good. They know what an espresso macchiato is."
51,Latei, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"the energy of Latei is quite unique within the whole neighbourhood.
