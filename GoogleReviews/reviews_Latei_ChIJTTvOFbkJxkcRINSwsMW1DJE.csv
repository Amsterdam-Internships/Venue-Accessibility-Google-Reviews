6,Latei, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had breakfast here a couple of months back and it was a hearty one! Love the soup of the day which was pumpkin soup. The carrot cake was moist and tasty. The hummus on toast was interesting too! The price is very affordable and the staff ‚Ä¶
7,Latei, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I really love like this place! The atmosphere is super relaxed, they have a nice choice of drinks and sweets, nice music and good vibes.

11,Latei, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I'm giving 5 stars because the ambience was cozy and staff is friendly and prices are reasonable. But the coffee and sandwhich was quite average and the portion was slightly small.
12,Latei, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"It's friendly, it's unique, it's delicious, and it's an iconic part of our neighbourhood.  Try the cheese & tomato croissant, it works!"

14,Latei, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Nice 50's style place with very friendly prices and service. But it took quite a long time and my friends chai latte tasted like warm milk. She got extra spices when we returned but it still didn't taste great.
15,Latei, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"In chinatown, very central, face to this beautiful temple. This small cafe experience was perfect! Good Chai Latte (one of my best try!), really nice cheesecake.

31,Latei, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Extremely friendly staff, amazing coffee and a really fun / eclectic ambience. Their cheesecake is probably the best in Amsterdam.

32,Latei, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Beatiful, kind of alternative cafe, very nice drinks."
33,Latei, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I loved their coffee and apple pie but the place itself is soooo seriously overwhelming! Like it feels claustrophobic and loaded with old stuff. I don't know if I would consider a revisit but all the cakes are soooo good.

35,Latei, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favourite places in Amsterdam! The food is simple but amazing, and the pies are better than my grandmas. The staff is very friendly and makes me feel at home. I would highly recommend dropping by, both for locals and tourists."

41,Latei, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I went here for a cappuccino and cheesecake  today. The cappuccino was great. The cheesecake tasted great, but it was a little on the cracked side. The interior of the cafe is great and has a nice retro look."
42,Latei, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"This cafe is everything I thought I wouldn't like. But it may be my favorite ever. It sells beautiful lamps, trinketry and furniture. They have very reasonable pricing, friendly service and a brilliant cappuccino. A must see. (Seriously, if I lived here I'd currently be arranging a way to move in.)"
43,Latei, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The absolute best in Amsterdam. It is always busy, more so at lunch, but don't miss an opportunity to stop in and say hi to Elvis if you are in town. Definitely grab a cappuccino, and my personal favorite is the dutch goat cheese sandwich on a fresh croissant!"
44,Latei, 5 stars ,9 years ago,Loved this place. The interior is really retro and takes you back in time. The owner has been running this already more than 18 years and he clearly still loves what he does. Also the fact that all the furniture is for sale is awesome. ‚Ä¶

50,Latei, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My go-to cafe on the Zeedijk. Nice people, good coffee, interesting cakes. Seating on the street if the weather is good. They know what an espresso macchiato is."
51,Latei, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"the energy of Latei is quite unique within the whole neighbourhood.
