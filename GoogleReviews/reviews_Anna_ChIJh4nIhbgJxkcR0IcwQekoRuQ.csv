1,Anna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is not bad, not spectacular and in small potion. Service is prompt and quite attentive."
2,Anna, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"It is a nice place. Food is good. The staff comes to ask if you like the taste a lot. The taste is good, but I was not very enthusiastic about the combinations at my plates. …"
3,Anna, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Extremely nice place with impeccable services and exquisite food.
4,Anna, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Probably the best restaurant in Amsterdam's Red Light District! One of the best restaurants I've ever visited; the food here is just wow and the service is amazing. I had the 5-course menu here with matching wines. Our waiter explained …
5,Anna, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, very good service, but not impressed with the food. Chose the seasonal dish (duck) and it was very ordinary, something you could've cooked yourself. But I would've probably been more impressed of I had chosen the regular dishes or the 3 course menu."
6,Anna, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Great food but very slow service
7,Anna, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"My father and I found this restaurant on an off hand search through Google. We consider ourselves foodies and oenophiles and selected this location based on previous reviews. The food is just this side of daring, favoring surprising …"
8,Anna, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, delicious staff, very polite and kind waitresses...  but what's about the reason I seated? Food is the real thing I looked for, and I was really disappointed! Taste missing at all! C'mon, how can you evaluate the place above average? Too much smoke before dinner I guess"
9,Anna, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"We enjoyed our dinner a mountain! The location is superb, the food very tasty and well presented. The staff would have made the fifth star had they been a bit more approachable. We published a full review on our travel blog travelmemo-com"

11,Anna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was a great restaurant and I wanted to book, but as you'll see, their website is ... weird, and they weren't answering the phone. So I walked over there: it's gone. No sign of it, even difficult to recognize which building it used to be in. Alas."
