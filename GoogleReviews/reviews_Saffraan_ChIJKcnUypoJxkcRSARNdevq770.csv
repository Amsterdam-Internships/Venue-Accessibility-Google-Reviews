0,Saffraan, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"The food is tasty indeed. A perfect place for grill dishes. Not bad for vegetarians. Though, it's a bit crowded now since the restrictions have been lifted. The distancing measures could have been better."
1,Saffraan, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Excellent place! The dishes are great quality and the food is very tasty. I tried the meat a few times, it's excellent and perfectly cooked. The pasta dishes are really delicious too. Will come back for the fish next time! …"
2,Saffraan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My wife and I were recommended to Saffraan by the Hotel Pestana and what an awesome experience. From the food to the atmosphere, it was great.
I do not eat much of this style of food but I would if I lived next store to Saffraan!"
3,Saffraan, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We enjoyed sharing a plate of mezzes for 2 ppl and didn’t need more food. Also the patio seating area is very pleasant in good weather. They have very tasty fish too.
4,Saffraan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was really great and the interior is very cozy. We were with a large group of people. The owner gave great suggestions, including wines. The portions were quite substantial. The owner mentioned also that the menu changes regularly, so definetely coming back soon."
5,Saffraan, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The food was delicious, and the service was great. The only problem was that there was no    English menu, but the staff explained the items, so it wasn't a big deal."
6,Saffraan, 5 stars ,a month ago,Absolutely love this restaurant every time I meant Amsterdam I go here the food is amazing
7,Saffraan, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Cingene kofte was a very pleasant surprise - I haven't asked them - but I'm sure it was grilled on charcoal, which was even at lunch time and for such a low price for the effort! Seating outside is very nice on a good weather - chairs and …"
8,Saffraan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Adana Kpap is great
Thanks to staff, they are very friendly
Turkish food"
9,Saffraan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was very delicious and tasted authentic mediterranian, the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was fitting. It is a bit pricey though. Try out combining a salad and a appetizer for a budget price."
10,Saffraan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Real good food, fair prices and a nice outside patio. The mixed tapas koud was great (Hummus :)), mediterranean sea offers a lot of different dishes.
Verry friendly service! Thank you - our recommendation!"
11,Saffraan, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Located next to Amstel, this place is missing a sign with their name on the outside, so you'll have to know what to look for. We ordered a cheese platter and got extra olives and bread as a ""starter"" which was a nice surprise. Staff were …"
12,Saffraan, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Shared a cold mezze plate, borek, sigara borek and lamb balls - all were tasty. Nice spot outside and comfortable and cozy interior as well"
13,Saffraan, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Decent food but took 90 minutes to serve
14,Saffraan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really excellent food and cozy place. Open kitchen so all the mouth watering smells strike you add soon as you go through the door. Will definitely be back
15,Saffraan, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Fast service, good pizzas. Only we had warm beer on a very hot day. Restaurants in NL are not used to dealing with 30 degrees; I guess one of their fridges broke down due to the extreme weather conditions. But this still doesn't justify warm beer when you most need a refreshing one end of the day."
16,Saffraan, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great pizzas for a fair price. Great location at the Amstel river. Terrace for warm weather but also a nice view from inside. Prosecco wasn't cheap and tasted average, but all in all, this is my favorite pizzeria in Amsterdam. …"
17,Saffraan, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place, they made a custom grilled chicken dish that I feel in love with. Highly recommend this place for its ambiance, food and wonderful staff."
18,Saffraan, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Friendly staff and nice to sit outside but the food was average at best. Very oily and just bland tasting. Pricey for what was given.
19,Saffraan, 1 star ,3 years ago,Turned up at this restaurant especailly after finding on trip advisor! Owner and staff were rude!! Gave us a menu after having to ask for one and then we’re told sorry no English menu. No help to understand things. We got up and left. Very rude and unwelcoming! Would not recommend at all
