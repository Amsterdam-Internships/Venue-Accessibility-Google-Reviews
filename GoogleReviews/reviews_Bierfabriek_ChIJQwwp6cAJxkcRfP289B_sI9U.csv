0,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"One my my fav place. The peanuts and bbq farm chicken is the best.
The beer tap was not working as expected , there was a lot of foam but they gave a good discount on it."
1,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Nice small menu and very nice spot there. Way too expensive and very small but this is Amsterdam. In a different city I would rate less star. The taste was also not so good.
2,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Wandered into this local brewery and eatery and really enjoyed ourselves.  Flight of 6 beers lets you sample their offerings.  Fabrieksgeheim (their porter) won a national gold medal; their pilsner (Puur) is the best for my money. ‚Ä¶
3,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a month ago,Top class bar with top class beer. Make sure to call in advance to book a table with the beer tap. No doubt that any trip to bierfabriek will result in a good time.
4,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Definitely recommend the beer tasting experience. Six very amazing beers at very good prices. Also very good food and cocktail menu.
5,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Good food. Good beer tasting. Good service.
Nothing to complain - much to enjoy!
I loved the idea of free peanuts as snacks on your freshly cleaned table. 5 stars say everything for this place."
6,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Nice spot, class beer üçª and nice ü•ú."
7,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a month ago,Nice location with a good variety of own brewed beers. I like it üëç
8,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great chicken! Beer tasting amazing, but the chicken is super lekker and very nice staff!"
9,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,10 months ago,I‚Äôm not drinking alcohol so can‚Äôt rate the beers but love coming here for the amazing grilled chicken. The BBQ sauce is my absolute favorite üòç
10,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice cosy place to have a beer or dinner. I had the chef special Ribs, it was really tender and delicious. The stew beef and the chicken was just amazing! Nice friendly staff & great ambience, worth a visit just to chill out!"
11,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere.  Good tank beer.  Good food.  Very lively, yet casual. Prices are fair.  They have peanuts on the tables and peanut shells on the floors - so avoid if you have a nut allergy.  The oils would be everywhere - impossible to avoid if you are highly sensitive (but that's not a complaint - just an FYI)"
12,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,2 months ago,Good place with microbrewed beer and good food.  Nice and open for Amsterdam.
13,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,5 months ago,I was very disappointed yesterday at the Bierfabriek. I have been there before and that's even more disappointing. The oh-so famous nuts everywhere were nowhere and we even had  to ask for them as the last time the always brought you new ‚Ä¶
14,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place for larger groups, even super large. The beer is great, especially Nero. Too bad the waiting time for the food is so long, even for the finger food and appetizers. Not recommended when you are very hungry... Still the staff is ‚Ä¶"
15,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Hidden gem in the heart of Amsterdam. Friendly, welcoming ambience. Fab music taste & spacious interior. Just a great place to chill, hang out, connect. Highly recommended."
16,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a month ago,"I was here after 10 years, same vibe same atmosphere ‚ù§Ô∏è Really good customer service and amazing beer‚Äôs"
17,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The best beer in the city and at a great price. The staff are always very friendly and, covid allowing, the peanuts inside are a fun addition.
If you are feeling adventurous then you can ask for the tap beers in 1 litre ‚Ä¶"
18,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Came for a couple of beers while strolling around city center in early evening. Nice chill vibe, was not too busy so service was fast. The peanut bags was an interesting touch, plus you can just sweep the leftovers off the table, so kind of a fun activity to eat as many free peanuts. Pigeons inside add to it."
19,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Located in a secluded ally, this hip brewery is perfect place to sit outside with friends. While the portions are on the smaller side (for an American used to Super Sized meals) it makes up with its great quality of food. The home brewed beers are a must!"
20,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Their speciaal chicken is a MUST try. And they brew their own beers (sorry i think that was obvious with the name) Super friendly staff as well. We enjoy our visits every time! Inside is very spacious, super fun also with groups! Keep it up guys!"
21,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A brewery in central Amsterdam serving owned brewed beers and others.  The free peanut are all over the place and it‚Äôs very good with beers .  Really love it.
22,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The chicken is awesome there! We had bier tab on our table, it was not cold enough, also only foam! but the peanuts were fun!"
23,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good relaxed vibe, loved the peanut-shells-on-the floor-theme and peanuts on the tables that you can munch your way through. Staff are very polite and friendly. Beer is good, so is the chicken. They also serve bitterballs which were great! ‚Ä¶"
24,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Great beer and snack! The pork belly skewers are amazing
25,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Reminds me of a classic hipster bar in the U.S. The peanuts on the tables and the friendly staff make a prefect laid back vibe to knock back a few beers. If you decided to grab some food, they have the best chicken I've ever had. Plus the ‚Ä¶"
26,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice place. It wasn't crowded, the staff was really friendly and music was really good. They have self tap beer in the table, but just when you book it in advance."
27,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First impression - Why there are nuts in the floor?
5 minutes later you are eating nuts bare hand while drinking your beer. Amazingly beautiful concept. Best pub to hangout with your friends. Have amazing dishes too."
28,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice setting, everybody id eating peanuts and throwing the shells on the floor. Food was good, but service was terrible. We were a group of 10, were told when booking that we would have to wait at the bar for half an hour, which was fine, ‚Ä¶"
29,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nicely decorated bar with 3 kinds of house brewed beer and simple but amazingly delicious food. We opted for the BBQ chicken and didn't expect each of us will actually get a whole mini chicken on our place. The chicken was one of the best ‚Ä¶
30,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I've been to their old location many times before.  The chicken there was excellent.  This time round at the current location I felt as if the quality went down a bit.
31,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I've been here many times, they have fresh tasty beers and great chicken and fries."
32,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, chicken (small nice for 1 person) is great, beer too, come with friends and enjoy the beer food, peanuts"
33,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Nice place, but limited beer choice. Beer is pretty good"
34,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Best place for dinner and drinks in Amsterdam. Alicia was the best. So helpful and kind :)
35,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,pretty awesome chicken.  one of the best I've had in awhile. highly recommended for the craft beer too
36,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I love the vibe of this place. Their beers are delicious and their roasted chicken is outstanding. It is one of my favorite places in Amsterdam for a Saturday night!
37,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good beer, great atmosphere but the service isn't so great and staff not too friendly. They should smile a bit more."
38,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent beers brewed on the premises, small foods menu (nice grilled chicken). The ambiance is great, peanuts everywhere, noisy and relatively fast."
39,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It‚Äôs a cool place with peanut everywhere! I really liked the red bier.. didn‚Äôt ordered food. Polite staff. Average prices.
40,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Fun atmosphere for drinks!
41,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Amazing place in the centre of Amsterdam. Great beers, lovely & nice staff, food is good (try their famous chickens) and there are peanuts.... for free! (You can even throw them to the floor üòâ). To sum up: heaven in Amsterdam"
42,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,9 months ago,The food and ambience is excellent. You get the best chicken in Netherlands here. The staff is very friendly and polite. If you go there once then that will become a habit and that can be rest assured.
43,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Amazing atmosphere and delicious food and drinks
I absolutely love it ü•∞"
44,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Amazing! Really good homemade beers and the place is super cozy!
45,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,If you wanna take a fast bite and your big in company this is the perfect place. Don‚Äôt expect high cuisine.. but price/quality is ok!
46,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nothing's better than freshly brewed beer and juicy whole chicken. The ambiance of a warehouse and unlimited access to free peanuts with beer makes it very different from the others. A must try when you are in Amsterdam.
47,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place for young people with fast food. The beer is good and the staff is friendly!
48,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Great beers, good food, excellent and friendly service. A place we will certainly come back to when in Amsterdam."
49,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,5 years ago,You can tap your own beer here! So that's a lot of fun. They also have great snacks that go with the beer. Good place for after-work-drinks :)
50,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice beer fabric in the heart of Amsterdam. Good beer and tasty food at reasonable price
51,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Bierfabriek is now in a new building which actually looks like factory)
Same tasty homemade beers, peanuts allover, chicken and variety of snacks/bites/fingerfood/platters"
52,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Super cool place with a great vibe. Love the home brew beer, especially Bianco! Also food is super tasty and good priced. I eat the chicken üòã. Will come back with a group of friends to book a table where you can tap your own beer! So much fun! Ps.: great location!"
53,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place to drink beer. Only 3 options are available (pils, pink and black), every has a bitter note. Good tapas."
54,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Peanut shells on the floor, great service,  good craft beer and delicious food (platters and chicken). On top of that nice and cool temperature in an otherwise scorching hot Amsterdam."
55,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Great beer and food! Perfect service :)
56,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I find the variety of beers a top in this place, food was ok üëç too. The peanuts sacks were a must here, haven't been there after covid."
57,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A bier place that is not looking to be more than that (I hope). They might think they have good food. Not really.
I recommend this place for biers and snacks only."
58,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Nice beer and good chicken. The place has a really nice aesthetic. Can recommend :)
59,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Perfect place for beers and food. Cozy atmosphere and a nice staff. Can recommend!
60,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Great place, clean, nice personell, beer is surprisingly good and cheap but lacks some little special extra, but my to go place to enjoy some various beers and cheap basic Snacks"
61,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,10 months ago,I was there with my girlfriend for lunch!  Great place with great foodü§§ Nice atmosphere and vibes From the staff!! Ah..don‚Äôt forget to taste the amazing home brewed Beers cos they were absolutely Good üçª
62,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"In this place was all perfect from the food to the beers! I particularly appreciate ""la rossa"" and the ham and buffalo mozzarella entry was very good! Also the chicken"
63,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Awesome atmosphere, great staff. And the chicken... Delicious!!!!"
64,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Cool for a cheap beer, but with with a metric ton of peanut shells on the floor for a chicken coop aesthetic and a rather obnoxious security guy"
65,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Fantastic beer and friendly service!
66,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Really enjoyed the Vals alarm red ale beer! Highly recommended!
67,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Absolutely love this place! The best home-made beer and the best crew ever. They love me too üòÖalways there!
68,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Best chicken in town. We go there for years and still super tasty. Crispy on the outside,  but soft and tender on the inside. Yummy!"
69,Bierfabriek, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Horrible service, rude waiters that don‚Äôt know anything about hospitality. They are literally annoyed that you‚Äôre sitting in their restaurant. Never experienced this in my life."
70,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious meal and great atmosphere. We recently paid a visit at Bierfabriek and we were extremely delighted with the food (best chicken in town) and the great choice of beers. Highly reccomanded, also easy to get to as in the city center."
71,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,4 months ago,You reserve a table and they throw you out after 2.5 hours. Even though they assured you beforehand that it won‚Äôt happen
72,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Came to the Bierfabriek as a recommendation from a local and it was a good choice. It is walking distance from the famous dam square. They give you free peanuts, these free peanuts are literally on every inch of the floor, i guess it‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶"
73,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a month ago,Delicious sweet potatoes!
74,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great homebrewn beer and amazing chicken! The staff is very friendly and helpful to decide the best combination of food and drinks.
10/10 place"
75,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I highly recommend this place. First, it is too crowded. You should at least wait 15-20 min to get a seat. While waiting you can eat free peanuts. That is really good. Beer is cheap compared to other places in Amsterdam. They have their own ‚Ä¶"
76,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Ton of peanuts, tasty food and good beer!"
77,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic spot! Beer is good and the Chicken is even better. Great 1st stop for me after arriving in Amsterdam.
78,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Nothing too special. The service personell was rather inattentive. The special brews weren't anything special. The food was only of average quality and taste which made it be overpriced in my opinion.
79,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice place with peanuts gratis everywhere and unlimited.
Great homemade beer , I recommend Rosso"
80,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I loved the beer. The Porter I had from a bottle was true to the style and poured dark with good head. I was less impressed with the service. Although the bartender was polite, I sat at an empty bar for 15 minutes with an empty glass. I was ‚Ä¶"
81,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Very good chicken and a nice guy behind the bar today. Will be back tomorrow.
82,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, service and food! Visit!"
83,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a great evening with friends, sharing a beer tap table. Peanuts were a great treat, serving our own beer was convenient, chicken was the right complement to the beer and atmosphere. Loved it. A good alternative to a sit down dinner."
84,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The bierfabriek is a nice place to go and have a beer with friends. When we were there the weather was really nice so we decided to sit outside. The lack of a nice terras is one of the reasons I gave a three star rating. The terras is big, ‚Ä¶"
85,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Loved the location and food, the club sandwich and craft beers were delicious!! The staff was really nice to us ‚ò∫Ô∏è I also met chef Marco and his food was just spot on üëåüèºü§§"
86,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a year ago,What a great night out! Food was very tasty and service excellent. Especially the spare ribs were amazing. The restaurant is just in a small street behind one of the ''main'' streets and pretty easy to find.  We would definitely come back! thanks allot!
87,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Cool place, love the home brewed beer and atmosphere. Super friendly service and down home cooking. Perfect place to have a low key evening with friends. Definitely recommend  a visit!"
88,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Alicia is the best super caring host!
89,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good and not expensive place with free nuts üòÄ, but quite croudy, so prepare that tables could be not not available on weekends."
90,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic atmosphere with tasty roasted chicken, interesting beers."
91,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Well I rarely give a restaurant five stars and this one deserves. For me it's all about service and product and price. And this place can't be any better. Brewery beer is nice and has descent options. And when it comes to food only one ‚Ä¶
92,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice food, nice ambiance !"
93,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place, singular habits, tasty and very recommended"
94,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"An interesting industrial themed beer bar that serve some very nice beers. They have a limited selection of 5 or 6 stock beers, but they have always been the same on the three occasions I have visited. They could improve by brewing some ‚Ä¶"
95,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place. Most waiters are friendly. Reasonably priced. Free peanuts. Just check your bill before you pay; a few extra beers appeared on ours.
96,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very very nice place to drink some beer, also the chicken is delicious."
97,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice craft beer and delicious farm chicken with unlimited peanuts. Good price, bit crowd in the evening. You need reservation. You can find peanuts sack on each wall. Just bring to your table, eat, throw away the skin of peanuts on the floor!!"
98,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow. This beer hall is different to anywhere else in the city...as far as I know. Bug industrial space with long shared benches or high tables. Open kitchen serving platters and street food. The beer is clean, cold and tasty. Try the Bianco or a run of the neat taster glasses. Smart friendly service"
99,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great place and simple. Good beer and good chicken for a good price, that's the bierfabriek. They produce their own beer and basically only have roast chicken as main dish. Only minus point is that it is always crowded and probably you will need to wait for a table, reservations usually only for groups."
100,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice bartender, tasty beer,  quite cheap."
101,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was overcooked, chicken was dry and chewy. Friend ordered a steak and was not. Impressed at all. It's too busy and they don't have enough staff to tend the customers. Had to ask for the bill a couple times. Bathrooms were nasty. Beer was good, but nothing too spectacular. Would not go back."
102,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place has a wonderful atmosphere. Definitely a place you want to bring friends. All of their house brewed beer was very good, and their roasted chicken was delicious as well. To top it off, free peanuts that you can toss wherever you'd like!"
103,Bierfabriek, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Service went down compared to previous visits. We had to pre-order food (due to being a big group), but still had to wait 2 hours for the main dish. Available staff did not seem to care much, and said repeatedly that it was a busy day and that food was coming soon. Also, we received the wrong dessert."
104,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Great beers and tasty chicken with the best barbecue sauce I know. Service is far too slow however. On multiple occasions it has taken forever without anyone even looking our way. You could easily hire someone who only goes around taking drink orders non stop and make more revenue!
105,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool ambience, homemade beer & has fantastic baby chicken free range, nicely overnight marinated with salt, pepper, aromatic & herbs...then roasted very well so that‚Äôs result tender, juicy your tastebuds.
Outstanding !"
106,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place. Lovely staff. The chicken on the menu is so small and the number of beer choices are limited. Be careful when you are walking inside, too many peanut shells and it is dangerous."
107,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"If you came here a while ago and remembered eating delicious grilled chicken, I regret to say things have changed. The menu has become overpriced for what you get. Waiting time for food can be ridiculous at times too. The beer is alright ‚Ä¶"
108,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Very fancy food, great for selective choices, but nothing for a group of friends looking for a meal and drink. Would not recommend for a group of people looking for a nice diner. If you're out for a special 2-person-diner with some precious beer choices, 100% go for it! Otherwise a price option"
109,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing concept, definitely pricey but worth it"
110,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Had a drink with my friends, . Despite the covid-19 rules, I had a great time! The staff was great and the ambiance was perfect for me and my friends. Beer tasted amazing ; )"
111,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Bierfabrik is a casual brewery with little extra casual in nature. The moment you are seated you will notice a pile of groundnuts on your table, simply lying there on the table. You break them, eat the nuts and throw the shell on the floor! ‚Ä¶"
112,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We went to the Bierfabriek to celebrate the birthday of a friend. While the concept is quite cool (you can throw the peanut shells on the ground, pour your own glad of beer and eat chicken with your hands) the practice is not really ‚Ä¶"
113,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good beers brewed on premise. The pour your own pint really adds to the group experience. Food selection is quite tasty and great for groups as well. I found the experience very trendy and primitive at the same time, and very enjoyable."
114,Bierfabriek, 1 star ,2 years ago,It looks good but it‚Äôs really not welcoming. The place wasn‚Äôt crowded at all and we just sat at a table. The waitress came (a long while later) and asked us to leave the table and go all the way back to the reception because the concierge ‚Ä¶
115,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice place for hangout, you can order beer or you can reserve table with beer taps installed, which I think the attraction. For Food peanuts are there and u don't have to worry for where to throw the shell, you will know as soon as you get ‚Ä¶"
116,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Not a huge selection of beers but definitely something different and they're all good. I really enjoy the nuts on the bar (even if I feel rude just throwing the shells on the floor). We didn't realise there was a bar at the back initially but there was plenty of space there which made things much nice.
117,Bierfabriek, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Super rude staff. We basically sat down at a table, nobody welcomed us nor served us for 15 minutes, then we went to one of the floor staff asking if we could order and her reply was ""who asked you to sit here? you can't sit at this table"" ‚Ä¶"
118,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"They have all you need on a rainy day. Got the nice locally brewed beer. Got the nice grilled chicken and finger food. And the best part, you get peanuts and get to throw the dirt on the floor!! Usually good service but if you are there on peak hour it might not be as good."
119,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Small selection of beers, good beers though (although if you call yourself a beer factory, one may expect more then 3 beers on the menu). There are friendly staff members (thumbs up) but also staff members (floor managers) who should take a ‚Ä¶"
120,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Food is OK. Service is slow, make many mistakes and just don't care"
121,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Very nice brewery right next to Dam Square. Can get crowded on the weekend but if you plan to come with many friends I suggest you to reserve in advance. Their beer are good, average prices but cool atmosphere are free peanuts! Love the tap ‚Ä¶"
122,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Simple menu but in general nice beer and tasteful beer flavored chicken. Unfortunately, it is not of a constant quality, sometimes the chicken is a bit dry. The peanut thing is a nice addition to the already nice atmosphere."
123,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,2 years ago,We had to wait for a long time till we finally got a table. They refused to give us tap water because we didn't order another drink and they did so in a not so polite way. The food was generally satisfactory and tasty.
124,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was just okay, beers were nice although we expected a better assortment of bottled and especially own beer (bier fabriek?). Out of the three drafts, only two are theirs. ‚Ä¶"
125,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The place itself looks different than others, the option to have a beer tap on your own table adds up to the experience. Though, the food is mediocre, the chicken was tasty, but in general a limited menu. prices are above average, even for Amsterdam."
126,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Surprisingly large pub, with an inviting 'industrial' decor, and a pleasant outdoor seating area.  The food and beer was tasty, although it has very limited options (for a main meal basically only roast chicken, plus one meat and one ‚Ä¶"
127,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice beers, though after trying all, I staid with the Puur, simply the best taste. Food is ok, though the chicken could use more fries, and the cheese plate more bread included. Fairly reasonably priced, considering the location."
128,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is a tourist trap, it is a poor rip off from the original ""biertuin"" which specializes in great chicken and nice beers. This is a large, dark and empty place which caters for tourists, mainly stag dos. My wife and I were a bit ‚Ä¶"
129,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Very good place! Pretty nice chicken, and interesting to see the peanut tradition :D"
130,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for a local craft beer and the special chicken is excellent.
131,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, fresh beer, nice atmosphere and quick service."
132,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"This place was awesome precorona, and still is now! Now they have 5 of their own beers so more reason to try them."
133,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We have been here with a friend of mine moved to Amsterdam recently so I was just considering it was a local spot. Having the peanuts with shell and throwing all the shells all around the floor was fun :) bier was good as expected. I can give 5 stars.
134,Bierfabriek, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I'm giving this joint 1 star because of the food. I ordered a crispy ceasar salad with chicken thighs and tortilla chips. What I got was lots of lettuce with mayonaise dressing, some bits of fried chicken and some crumbs of tortilla chips. ‚Ä¶"
135,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I was thrilled when I've tasted the, on the past so tasty, BBQ chicken.
The quality dropped by alot even on the French fries. The recipe of the chicken changed to something you could easily cook by yourself (if you don't know how to ‚Ä¶"
136,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"For chicken lovers it can be good choice. They serve the chicken always the same quality and taste. Chickens are really young chickens, tender. Fries as a side dish are also nice, sauces as well. They have some kind of sausages and fried ‚Ä¶"
137,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Really great experience ! 1 litter bears :)
138,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Super nice beers and a great vibe !
139,Bierfabriek, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We went there for dinner, the place is nice, the beer is good but the food is not exceptional, chicken and chips it's basically something you could cook at home! We had to wait almost an hour before we finally got our food! And make sure ‚Ä¶"
140,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Surprisingly large bar with ample seating--from booths and tables, to bar chairs and long benches. In the Rokin side of the bar, there are several tables with two built-in taps. On a weekday, it may be quiet enough to walk in, but I'd ‚Ä¶"
141,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great beer and atmosphere.
142,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Love the peanut concept (they are spread all over the place). I made a reservation to have dinner and they put us on tables with no chairs and in 2 separated tables. The staff was also really unfriendly. They only have 3 beers of their own. I hate this place since they moved.
143,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Small selection of beers and overpriced food, but free peanuts. I had the bruschettone caprese which mentioned only tomato, mozzarella and pesto and instead old bread with tomatoes, something white and possibly a liter of balsamic vinegar arrived."
144,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great ambiance, comfort food, and super friendly staff.  Super chill and easy.  Definitely a great place to hang out and enjoy with friends or colleagues."
145,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"If good grilled chicken, good beer and peanuts all over place is your thing, must visit this place."
146,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place but bad service. Good for large groups but be ready to wait...and wait... and wait. Needless to say don‚Äôt order the wine. Chicken was fine, good value for money. Nothing else to write home about."
147,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,4 years ago,For a place with such a name there is no place for people who just wants to seat and drink some beer. Just a hell lot of people left the place because you can‚Äôt take the place with a tap (if you have 4 people company) and all other place is ‚Ä¶
148,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"For being the middle of the afternoon and hardly any full tables, the service was sub par even with 3 servers working. Ordered a second round of drinks which never came yet were charged to our bill. Our main dish didn't come with the side listed on the menu either. Food tasted okay, what little we had."

153,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very funny place to have corporate events and team buildings. They have two types of tap beer at every table upstairs (regular plus red or dark) and a meter that shows how much beer did you consume. So you have a big group of people you can ‚Ä¶
154,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The beer was amazing, but the service was bad. We were there with friends, waited more than 30 minutes for one order. We saw a lot of free servants, who even didn‚Äôt look at us, didn‚Äôt respond to us. After some time they came telling that the place is reserved and that we have to leave the place. Was so sad."
155,Bierfabriek, 1 star ,3 years ago,There was a drunk group of people inside and they were disturbing the other tables. Throwing peanuts and falling down to other tables. they have amazing chicken and beers but it is hard to eat or drink something and have chat with friends.
156,Bierfabriek, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Great beer, awesome setting. Still need to try out the pay-per-litre beer taps! On the occasions in the early afternoon I have visited the music has been terrible - pop rubbish, crappy Robbie Williams swing offending the most. If that was fixed, something ambient would be nice, it would be the best place in town."
157,Bierfabriek, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We got ignored by the staff when we came in in the first place. Secondly, they waited half an hour before we could order a beer. The food was ok. But the staff kept us waiting another half hour before we could order a beer. So we decided to ‚Ä¶"

161,Bierfabriek, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The intended atmosphere isn't quite achieved. Large brewing vats visible at the entrance and peanut shells littering the floors could be cozy and authentic, but instead here it's a bit cheap, haphazard and simply messy. There are only four ‚Ä¶"

163,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very rude servers, walked in by mistake and made the bigger mistake of asking if they were open - apparently asking for polite behavior at BierFabriek is like finding water in a desert. ‚Ä¶"
164,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Simple concept but very well executed! The basically serve their own beers and roasted chicken which is very tasty!  They have other options in the menu though. Service is impeccable and always friendly.
165,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Thank you Alicia! Amazing service
166,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Good if you are looking for some beer (and nuts) with mates. Each table has its own tap, which you can use as you wish, and get billed per ml at the end. A very social and enjoyable experience!"
167,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Impolite and slow service. Chicken was juicy but would be great if more crispy. Fries were bad. Homemade white beer was just okay.
168,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Very hospitable and friendly! Delicious drinks and meals, fast service, I recommend!"
169,Bierfabriek, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very upset with this bar. We were 25 people and could not split the bill. The waiter did not help us and one of our friends had to organize all the mess and pay for all. Very bad thought and irresponsible

187,Bierfabriek, 1 star ,2 years ago,"PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE. We were a table of two and waited approx 1.5 hours for two meals. We asked the woman serving us if it was nearly ready and she said ‚Äúit will just be a minute‚Äù, then someone else came over and said our order had been lost and it will be right out - it took about another 15 mins. Sorry bye, never coming back."

Beers are still good"
189,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,a year ago,Service was amazing. Went with a group of friends and we had a good time. They did not have the peanuts anymore due to corona

191,Bierfabriek, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Small beer selection, staff isn't the nicest and can't get a table to drink beers around 8pm because they're reserved for dining guests. So only option is to try to find a place at the bar which is very limited. So standing at the bar looking at empty tables... Kinda weird."
192,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Eating peanuts and drinking nice bianco beer.. Here you can.. I really liked it.
193,Bierfabriek, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"It's a great location if you are looking for a very laid back atmosphere, similar to an American Sports bar with peanut shells on the floor and large screens. Chicken is absolutely delicious!!"

Still 3 stars for nice atmosphere, free peanuts and the amazing barbecue smell."
203,Bierfabriek, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Very unfriendly personal, although we waited half hour we did not get a seat and that although there were enough free tables!
The reason was easy, we did not wanted to have dinner just a drink and that at 21:00!!!!"

217,Bierfabriek, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very bad service. Pigeons fly inside the restaurant and try to get food from  the tables. The staff does not even apologize for this whole mess. Totally unacceptable. Do not bother coming to this place.
