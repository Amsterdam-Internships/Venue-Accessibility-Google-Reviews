5,cafe Orloff, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"We were with friends and our kids on sinterklas day. The staff was very nice, also with the kids. Coffee was good. It's cozy inside were we sat with the kids running away from the cold wind. Gewoonlijk Nederlandse publiek."
6,cafe Orloff, 3 stars ,a week ago,Nice pub but Typical Dutch food. Go elsewhere to eat
7,cafe Orloff, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Found this place after a visit to the Maritime museum. So glad we opted to eat here. Had a terrific lunch.

Service was quick and attentive
8,cafe Orloff, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great sandwiches and soups at an excellent price. I warmly recommend this place to tourists and locals alike. The photo is of their chicken and bacon sandwich. The wait time was slightly long (30-35 mins), but the atmosphere is good and the food is worth it! The dishes are also very well presented."
9,cafe Orloff, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Cozy pub with nice thin pizza. Soup was nice too. Special menu (not from their printed standard menu) are available for dinner only.
10,cafe Orloff, 5 stars ,6 months ago,We came here for breakfast spontaneous and it was the best decision! Everything was so tasty and the staff was very friendly. 10/10 would recommend!
11,cafe Orloff, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Very bad service!!!!! If you order some meal they make a mistake and bring you what you didn't ordered. Only three types of pizza they have: one Tuna (Parmesan), second with grilled vegetables (Feta) and Mozzarella. So they bring you pizza ‚Ä¶"
12,cafe Orloff, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A cracking canal side bar, with great staff and good beer. If you are heading to Artis Zoo or any of the shopping streets down here then Orloff is a great stop off."

16,cafe Orloff, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Food was amazing- make no mistake. This rating is purely for the lax service. I had to chase down my waiter both for my order and the check. It's definitely a spot for the locals. I was there on a Friday around 7 and it wasn't overly busy ‚Ä¶
17,cafe Orloff, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Superb local spot and very noice waiter(s). Always smiling and in for a cheeky chat. Their ‚Äòkaas stengles‚Äô are the best combined with a cold ‚Äòwitbiertje‚Äô on their big terrace. Great place outside the busy areas, but a most go if you are around the north east side of the centre."
18,cafe Orloff, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent place to eat and relax. The sandwichs are very tasty, well presented and served relatively quickly. Besides, the mood inside is very cosy: Candles, smooth jazz music and film posters all around. Highly recommended to eat or to grab a coffee after a long walk!"
19,cafe Orloff, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic Bar to grab a drink or a bite with friends or family.

I will definitly be back if i get the chance.
20,cafe Orloff, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great for after-work drinks, especially with colleagues from Oracle. The staff at Orloff is very nice, but you have to pro-actively approach them, maybe even go to the bar and order. Otherwise you would wait very long."
