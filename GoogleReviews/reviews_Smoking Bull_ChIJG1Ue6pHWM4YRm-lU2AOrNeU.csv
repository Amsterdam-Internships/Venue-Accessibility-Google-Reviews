0,Smoking Bull, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Great food. Awesome atmosphere. Dana was an awesome server. The deep fried mushrooms were absolutely delicious. Steaks cooked perfectly. I tried the red snapper(not blackened) and it was awesome. It's not cheap but worth every penny.

6,Smoking Bull, 1 star ,5 months ago,I see that in this country and AR skin color does still matter in the south. If you are a african american don't go to this establishment. Poor service and poor quality of food is what you will receive. America and some people will never change!
7,Smoking Bull, 1 star ,7 months ago,The Steak i had was not worth $35 and the experience wasnt either.  When my wife and i were done the waiter came back with a bill for $110.  All im saying is never again.
