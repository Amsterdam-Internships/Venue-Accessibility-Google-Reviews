5,Nooch, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Well, none of the menu is cooked in authentic way (and the genre of their cuisine is far away from being ""fusion"" as some reviewers seem to believe), but at the end of the day most of dishes are cooked with respect for basic techniques and ‚Ä¶"

13,Nooch, 5 stars ,a month ago,The best Pad Thai and Pho Bo I ever had! Wish they would be open again for lunches!
14,Nooch, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent Asian cuisine; friendly service; relaxed environment. Located at the famous 9th Street; it's a nice spot for lunch or dinner. Reservation is recommended.
15,Nooch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food and a calm atmosphere. This was a nice place to eat and relax after walking around the canals all day.
16,Nooch, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The dumpling wrappers were a bit too thick in my opinion but the vegetable and shrimp fillings were really tasty. The fried yuki sushi was a bit pricey but I really like that they were not stuffed with too much rice (but the rice was ‚Ä¶

19,Nooch, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Definitely my favourite restaurant in Amsterdam, keeps me coming back"
20,Nooch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Udon with fish never fails. Too bad they don't cook the beautiful tuna tartar on their lunch menu
21,Nooch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very tasty food!  I had the duck over rice and it was very delicious.  Atmosphere is nice too and neighborhood surrounding it is lovely.

25,Nooch, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great food. Reasonable prices. We found the place by googling nearby restaurants by ratings. These guys are clearly 4+ stars

27,Nooch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food! I had pecking duck (see picture) and it was delicious! Just crispy enough and not too sweet which is something that bothers me in Asian restaurants sometimes. The service was great and the overall mood was nice. A great place ‚Ä¶
28,Nooch, 3 stars ,5 years ago,A family restaurant serving simple and moderately priced Asian food (mainly Japanese) located within walking distance from city center. Friendly staff and good place to chill out.
29,Nooch, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"The food was amezing, also the collection of foreign beers is SUPER. The only thing dissapoting was the beertap. But that is something you can't overcome in corona times. ‚Ä¶"
30,Nooch, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great tasting food and a wide variety menu with plenty to choose from. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. I've been here at least 3 times with 3 different items from the menu and enjoyed each one just as much as the previous one. ‚Ä¶
31,Nooch, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was amazing and looked great. But the chopsticks were heavier than normal chopsticks, and very hard to handle. The staff was very kind. You can change the things on the menu if you don‚Äôt like some things and there are a lot of vegetarian options."
32,Nooch, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is great. We had the dim sum platter, the mixed sushi and mandarin pancakes. Great quality. It seemed the service struggled a bit more as more people came in, as we had to remind them that we ordered desserts (after a 20+ minute wait). Despite this, we would come back to Nooch, mostly for the food."
33,Nooch, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Disappointing meal with no character. Chicken was hard to chew with a thick sauce that was not home made, soup was very salty and pad thai had not much taste. Lived in many Asian countries and this was not close to it. Service was ok but not very focused on client."
34,Nooch, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Reserved dinner here for a group of 30 people from different backgrounds, cultures and tastes. It was nice to find a place that is able to cater different wishes, dietary needs and tastes so well and so easy. Shared dining menu with ‚Ä¶"

37,Nooch, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I came very hungry and I was so satisfied by my meal. I tried few dimsum for a starter and seafood noodles for the main. It was absolutely amazing! I definitely recommend you if you like Asian food. You will not be disappointed!
38,Nooch, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I‚Äôve been there 2 days ago for the first time. It was dinner time, so restaurant was quiet busy, but we were lucky to find a table. I had Sushimi and Niggiri. It was really tasty. They also have variety of soups and other sushi. Price was ‚Ä¶"

42,Nooch, 4 stars ,4 years ago,I ordered take out form here with Uber Eats and the food was good. Sushi had mayo in it which I liked surprisingly and the fish was fresh . The Pad Thai had nicely cooked shrimp and chicken in it along with fried Tofu. It wasn't super saucy ‚Ä¶
43,Nooch, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Price of the items is good. Some dishes were really tasty and nicely presented. But we got our cava in normal wine glasses, the Peking duck was not crunchy  and golden brown as it should be but bland, squishy and grey, and some other items were simply not up to par. Ambiance was quite nice."
44,Nooch, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The restaurant is nice itself and cosy. The first waiter who worked before 5pm was a little busy but tried to look after everyone. The next shift not so much. We had beef teriyaki which was average and sadly seemed like a kids portion. Duck ‚Ä¶
45,Nooch, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It took a while to get our meal (we were a group of 8), but it was well worth waiting. The staff was friendly, accommodating and gave lots of attention to the customers. They didn't need to ask who ordered what meal and they remembered our dietary limitations when we came to the next order."
46,Nooch, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cosy restaurant and friendly staff. Quality is there, quantity is smaller than expected whilst keeping price in mind. We ordered the pad thai and were disappointed with the taste. It was presented beautiful but the flavors was very ‚Ä¶"
47,Nooch, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This was my first meal in Amsterdam.  A good friend suggested the place and it was great. Cocktails, appetizers,  and entrees were packed with flavor.  I wanted to get away from tourist traps and eat where the locals ate.  This was a perfect way to start off my Amsterdam experience."
48,Nooch, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Well hoped that this would be a pleasant experience but after ordering it all went downhill. Non existing service and the food was bland. Saving grace was the 10% discount for forgetting our food for an hour. ‚Ä¶
49,Nooch, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Been here a few times now. Unfortuanelty the last two experiences were really terrible. The first time the waiters were having issues with the payment machines and rudely told us to go find an ATM acting as if the machine not working would ‚Ä¶

55,Nooch, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Fantastic, varied Asian food. Every single dish was delicious and we were very impressed with the Asian flavours. If you are looking for a place with fresh ingredients and a modern take on classics this is a great stop."
56,Nooch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely delicious food! Pad Thai made vegan and honestly one of the best we have ever had! I would have taken a picture but I already ate it! Irresistible!

59,Nooch, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I have visited this place several times now and the food is always of high quality. Service is sloppy though and we often have to wait a long time (>30min) for the server to show up at our table to be able to order (more) food and drinks.
60,Nooch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Duck on rice was absolutely delicious, the staff were lovely and went above and beyond. Definitely recommend!

64,Nooch, 1 star ,4 years ago,Only one staff working in the whole restaurant. Waited for a long time and no one was serving at all. Couldn't even make an order before leaving. I think the restaurant should increase the manpower to avoid customers from waiting for a long ‚Ä¶

66,Nooch, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best sushi in town! Wow!
67,Nooch, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice restaurant on paper, but let down by the really slow service. 50 mintues to get some edamame and a little bit of sushi. Looking at some of the reviews, it appears someone there needs to learn how to expedite because what was coming out looked quite nice."
68,Nooch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Generous portions, very good service, calm atmosphere... and tasty food!
I took the Taipei soup and the Mandarin Pancakes, I would come here again!"
69,Nooch, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Amazing food, amazing staff, will return very soon!"
70,Nooch, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good food. Would describe more as a fusion? But that might just be ultra Asian me nitpicking. The cocktails were amazing.

UPDATE:  One year later.  Had the same dish and same lemonade and it was exactly as I had remembered.  The service was a little slow, but we'll worth the wait."
74,Nooch, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Mediocre take on Asian dishes, offers everything but specializes in nothing. Large menu with no focus. Staff was slow and inattentive, washrooms were dirty. Far too expensive for what it is, go elsewhere."
75,Nooch, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful food, great atmosphere. Service can be a little slow when busy but the food is worth waiting for."
76,Nooch, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Decent, but nothing great.

96,Nooch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food, quick & friendly staff and amazing bartender!! He made me the best espresso martini."
97,Nooch, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Food decent but extremely slow service and kitchen.   Don't go unless you plan to spend 2 hours even for lunch.   One server for the whole front of the house to do everything, even bussing."

99,Nooch, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely staff, good mix of Asian cuisine and nice wine. All for a reasonable price."
100,Nooch, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Not bad. But the food consists of pretty uninspired versions of the most well known Asian dishes. Too expensive for what it is.
101,Nooch, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"good food, nice staff, slightly slow service - but worth the wait:)"
