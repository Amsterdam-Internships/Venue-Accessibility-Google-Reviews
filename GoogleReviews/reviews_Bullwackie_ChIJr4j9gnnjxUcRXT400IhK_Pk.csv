After finished shopping just sayed ""bye"" and go another person. Didn't asked i want any papers or filters. Didn't smile. I have this in other coffeshops, so just gonna return to them"
3,Bullwackie, 1 star ,3 months ago,I'm a frequent customer and today I was given the 'last gram' of a batch. I came home and weighed it only to find out I was given less than 1 gram even though the guy did say it was a full gram.

7,Bullwackie, 1 star ,11 months ago,"2 people who work there are extremely rude, although the other personnel members are nice, furthermore the weed is bad quality, yet their weed is expensive at the same time, the cash dispenser machine is often broken, a better coffeeshop would be de prijs located at suriname plein, about 5 minutes distance from this coffeeshop."
