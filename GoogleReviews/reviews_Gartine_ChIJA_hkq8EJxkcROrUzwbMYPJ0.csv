21,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Top experience in every way. Food was unique, delicious and healthy. Service was very charming and thoughtful (they split our soup into 2 bowls ahead of time when we passively mentioned we'd be sharing it). I'd eat here every day if I lived in Amsterdam."
22,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very friendly staff and amazing food. Make a reservation if you can and pay attention to their limited opening days - then shen you go indulge. Their bagel has an insnae dough and fresh cheese, ghe cheesecake is out of this world and for tee lovers will find their fix here as well"
23,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We heard the tea here was good so we came on a hot summer day for iced tea and lunch. I tried it and wow, really excellent iced tea. Not too sweet and nice flavors. Expectations met. Then we ordered the endive soup and eggs benedict. ‚Ä¶"
24,Gartine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place has the best eggs benedict I‚Äôve ever had. Served w b√©arnaise sauce, fresh herbs, salad with an incredible dressing, and ham that is truly european and not this Canadian bacon BS. I wish I had the stomach to try more of their food ‚Ä¶"

26,Gartine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A really nice place, good food and very friendly staff :) It was quite a lot of people here in this small restaurant, so to be sure to get a table I guess booking in advance is good. I didn't book in advance but got a perfect spot anyways. Thank you :)"
27,Gartine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place serves the best breakfast in town. The portions are in modest size for me but they are so finely prepared. Quiet and posh ambience for a great start of a day!
28,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place was very delicious and worth hunting down. It‚Äôs a small space so recommend reserving a table (though I was able to walk in and sit down). Take the time to flip through their book and ask more about the farm where the vegetables come from.

Enjoyable, cosy restaurant with fresh ingredients! I had the pancakes with blueberries and nuts but was tempted to try everything on the menu."

38,Gartine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Awesome breakfast spot! I had the yogurt and my partner had the eggs benedict with Gouda. Both were great!
39,Gartine, 5 stars ,a month ago,Amazing healthy food.
40,Gartine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,So good I went twice in 3 days! I disagree that it‚Äôs expensive - the quality of the food is well worth it! This was probably my favorite restaurant during my entire trip!
41,Gartine, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place. The food is ok but you can find better in other places (see other reviews). And the place is really tiny. A bit overrated, I think."

58,Gartine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a great spot for a quick, delicious lunch or if you have more time, their tea service looked like a nice way to spend an afternoon.

60,Gartine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A most friendly host welcomed us as old friends at this lovely establishment, middle in the hussle and bussle of the city center. You wouldn't have guessed to find such a nice quiet place. The ingredients are all fresh and grown in their ‚Ä¶"

62,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The restaurant is tucked in between buildings, so it's easy to miss. But it's worth hunting for! The dining area was very small, so I would recommend coming early or making reservations. We came in half way through the service, and although ‚Ä¶"

Eggs Benedict was amazing, great ambience. Very kind and welcoming family ‚Ä¶"
64,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really really nice and helpful staff. Beautiful and healthy and fresh menu. No alcohol on the menu so just soft drinks and teas. The food was delicious. I had the brioche and my friend had the spinach cake. Also delicious deserts. Definitely recommend this place! Small space by the way so you might have to wait for a table.
65,Gartine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Go for the high tea. This spot will not disappoint. Make reservations.
66,Gartine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of my favorite places in Amsterdam. The owner couple are nice and most of ingredients of food are from their own garden. Homemade authentic food with fresh ingredients are indeed amazing and the taste is awesome as well! Desserts and high tea are great too.
67,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a must! The best farm to table menu in Amsterdam, in an adorably quaint space, run by a husband and wife duo. I come here again and again and am always amazed by the combinations. Everything I‚Äôve had on the menu is heavenly!!! Make a reservation in advance if you‚Äôre on a tight schedule, it fills up quickly!"
68,Gartine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We are visiting here for a soc cer tournament. One of the parents suggested that we try this place which turned out to be a great idea. We were a very large group but it didn't take them long to seat us. 2 of us were running behind but they ‚Ä¶

70,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Unfortunately we were not able to eat here but the service and friendliness deserves a stellar review and mention nonetheless. ‚Ä¶
71,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This was an amazing and lucky find, we did not have a reservation but showed up just as a table was free. The food tasted amazing and the flavors were stunning. There were plenty of vegetarian options for my friend and the meal sizes were perfect. I look forward to returning during my next trip to Amsterdam!"
72,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I walked in during a time normally packed with reservations, and they were still able to find me a seat for a short brunch, and boy was I surprised by the quality of the food! I ordered the Eggs Benedict with ham, and it was so light and ‚Ä¶"

79,Gartine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is an amazing restaurant, tucked away in a very touristy part of town. Every detail is considered and the service and food were perfect. The care they take with all of the food is very apparent. Everything we had was delicious. (They ‚Ä¶"

81,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best place in Amsterdam.  Organically grown veggies, and full of flavours.  The soup is a must.  I don't even bother to ask what type of soup any more.  Just order a bowl of soup, and comes with perfectly toasted bread and incredible ‚Ä¶"

83,Gartine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, great food, great host and staff. Cool antiquated decor.
Delicious for brunch: eggs were great, croissant and homemade peach jam as well, fruits were delicious.
Definitely would recommend the place!"
84,Gartine, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent breakfast. Yogurt with pear is delicious! Need to book in advance (dozens of people tried during our stay). Ask for rooms in the back to avoid getting cold every time somebody enters or exit (most often to ask unsuccessfully for a table).
85,Gartine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We came across this lovely gem while looking for a place to eat breakfast. As you enter you are greated by the lovely and very perceptive staff. Keep in mind that this is a rather small establishment so you may need a reservation. As far as ‚Ä¶
86,Gartine, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Cozy vibe, great food and coffee, the staffs are friendly."
87,Gartine, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Phenomenal. Fresh farm-to-table (from the owners' farm, no less) fare at its finest, yet casual and comfortable. An array of teas are interesting and delightful. Pancakes are spot on. Breakfasts are light or hearty, however you prefer. Prices are very reasonable, if not cheaper than what they could be. Will be a must-visit always."
88,Gartine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious, there is no other word to describe it (actually there is, just try it and find out). It really deserves its slow food label, the meals are prepared with the utmost care, the presentation, the mix of flavours/consistencies are great and on top of that the waiters/waitresses are warmhearted. Go for it, this is an order."
89,Gartine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favorite places to lunch! Good service, excellent biological food. You need to reserve here and that pretty much says it all. I think this is one of the few places in Amsterdam where you need to"
90,Gartine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best places I've ever been. Why aren't there more such restaurants... such delicious food and friendly people. Must go to Amsterdam soon again, just to go to this place again!!! Hope they translate there cook book to English soon."
91,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A gem of a find in the midst of very touristic and overpriced restaurants. Truly exceptional brunch/lunch food served up at reasonable prices for Amsterdam (‚Ç¨9-13ish). Their chestnut and fig cake with coffee frosting was a perfect end to a special lunch.
92,Gartine, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"How this place exists in this neighborhood I'll never understand! My friend from out of town suggested going here after reading great reviews, but I was skeptical AF. Like really, off of Kalverstraat? But trust me, I was dead wrong. We made ‚Ä¶"

100,Gartine, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Fortunate enough to stumble upon this place and lucky they had a free table (around 2:30).  Very relaxed atmosphere and a delicious lunch (tea, fresh salad, homemade bread and crawfish with smoked salmon).  Very small place so if recommend it for couples or groups no larger than 4.  Reservations recommended."
101,Gartine, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Had a phenomenal high tea at the amazing Gartine. Such a reputation and so worthy of it. The place is so adorable and charming. Rustic yet with a touch of class. The servers were all so sweet and welcoming. Such super lovely peeps. They ‚Ä¶

104,Gartine, 5 stars ,a year ago,I highly encourage everyone to have breakfast at this place when visiting Amsterdam!! The food was absolutely delicious and the staff was very friendly and attentive. Loved it here!!
105,Gartine, 1 star ,3 years ago,Small and very disorganized.    Three things on menu were not available.   Presentation of food seems to be more important than anything else.   And bring cash ... They don'thandle anything else.   Stay away.  Not worth it.   Don't believe ‚Ä¶
106,Gartine, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The staff was amazing and the high tea was fantastic, especially given the low price! I had the best macaroons ever, highly recommend this place."

108,Gartine, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Breakfast was delicious! Ordered the French toast and it was amazing, one of the best I've ever had. Servings were a bit small though so don't go if you're hungry."
109,Gartine, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Home made food from their own vegetable garden served in this small beautifull restaurant. The owners work hard to make sure everyone has a fantastic meal even though its always full. I am glad we had a reservation because there were some dissapointments for the walk-ins.
110,Gartine, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I legit ADORE this place. It's so hidden away, but does amazing salads along with lovely tea and cakes. Super quiet, but it's ALWAYS completely booked out. Seriously, don't bother showing up, BOOK IN ADVANCE or you'll get turned away... but when you go, it's worth it."
111,Gartine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent food,  lovely tea and excellent owners. I could definitely recommend this place to everyone. I'd only try to ring them in advance in order to do a reservation as the place doesn't have many seats (only 25 or something)."
112,Gartine, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice place, good food, sweet people. Very much located in the centre so perfect after a day of shopping or sight seeing. Just make sure that you reserve ahead to avoid disappointment. Service can be very slow, so don't be in a hurry."
113,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A place created by kind people making something beautiful. Elderly ladies having tea, young lovers gazing at one another, families laughing. A wonderful meal, Dutch and real, and I lingered sipping gruhwein, reading and watching the scene. ‚Ä¶"
114,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Everything was delicious. I loved it üòç
115,Gartine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had an amazing time. The food was incredible, we had the scramble eggs and the salmon bagel, and if we didn't want to try other places in the few days of our stay, we would visit everyday."
116,Gartine, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"One of the coolest places I could find in Amsterdam, this tea room is a dive in another era with a fresh, accurate modern service.

121,Gartine, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Though this place is rated so highly and the place is sooo hard to get a reservation for, I still don't see the fuss about it. I didn't find it particularly special and it definitely did not have that 'wow' factor for me, though the staff were friendly."
122,Gartine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,i am completely disarmed. i am not a big eater but i immediately had to go for a 3-course lunch after seeing the menu. i felt as if i was welcomed into the owners‚Äô family house and taken through an unforgettable food journey. thank you!
123,Gartine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly service and wonderfully messy eggs Benedict‚Äôs
124,Gartine, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The soup was great, but a very small portion, the Chai was nice, but the rest of the dishes weren‚Äôt anything to write home about. Way too expensive for what you get. The staff is very nice, though."

131,Gartine, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Looks nice but it's really small. There's a tiny table upstairs and call in advance as you might need reservations. The hostess was very nice about that and perhaps you'll enjoy this place too. :-)
