0,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Even though i came right before closing, i was asked to wait a few minutes longer so my pasta could be made fresh. It was a takeaway order and i got a bag of bread and dip free of charge. The carbonara was well made, i asked for extra pepper and they delivered! Ill come back again next time :)"
1,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Food was ok! Plenty of food, including vegan options. Service too slow when busy tho"
2,Il Boccalino, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Cute restaurant and friendly waitress. The pizza was super dry though, which isn't really how I like my Pizza, and the Gnocchi weren't special. All in all: if you cant decide for anything else you'll find something here, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it."
3,Il Boccalino, 1 star ,a month ago,Ordered foods twice at this place. First time the ordered was cancelled after an hour waiting with no further message. ‚Ä¶
4,Il Boccalino, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Nice service. The waitress was really lovely. ( the one that helped us in English) the food took over one hour to be ready so that was disappointing. The gnocchi was delicious and the meat ( escalopini) option was ok.  It is a good place if you are looking into lower price and average food.
5,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The gnocchi from the oven was very tasty and the carbonara was very italian! Like without cr√®me, Lovely :)
The owner was very kind and was working very hard. Very laid back atmosphere"
6,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Great service with friendly people::) definitely recommend and would come again :)))  Edward and Marina was very sweet and gentle with us :)))
7,Il Boccalino, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Ordered a salad, very small portion and the vegetables were not fresh. Not worth the price. The service was really slow."
8,Il Boccalino, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Very kind and lovely waitress! :)
Cute, small and quite restaurant"
9,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,10 months ago,This place is a hidden gem! You can easily pass by it without noticing Il Boccalino sign even though it's located on a very busy shopping street. But in my opinion it's the best pizza place in the city. We've been ordering pizza from here ‚Ä¶
10,Il Boccalino, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Had to wait 1 1/2h for our pizza (the restaurant was not full). And it was not worth it...
The bruschetta was untoasted white bread  with a little bit of pesto and some ‚Ä¶"
11,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Had a takeaway pizza from here, really tasty and good value. Staff were very friendly as I ordered too"
12,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Had a great Time Here. Delicious Italian Food and a good vibe. Can totally recommend
13,Il Boccalino, 1 star ,a year ago,"Ordered 40 min before they close. Canceled our order 30 minutes after, leaving us without any option since all the other restaurants were closed as well by that time. No problem with an order being canceled but do it right away or change your opening times."
14,Il Boccalino, 3 stars ,a year ago,"If you're searching at night for anything to eat it's an ok place to go to, no high expectations tho. Pizza is too crunchy on the outside and not properly baked on the inside, calzone was mainly filled with onions and barely any ham/other ‚Ä¶"
15,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"They just re-opened and it's really worthwhile. The good is delicious and gives you the real Italian feel. Not a really stylish interior, but perfect for a simple Italian meal. We had spaghetti putanesce and vegetarian lasagne big portions and good taste. Service very friendly and helpful. I can recommend it!"
16,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best pizza in the town very Italian . I'm addicted to this restaurant üòç
17,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Amazing value for money and friendly waiters / waitresses.
18,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very delicious homemade Italian food, nice atmosphere, kind staff and a fair price. Highly recommend. Would definitely come again :)"
19,Il Boccalino, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We got a table of two and ordered two pizzas and one starter. After ONE HOUR waiting with no feedback, we asked about our food, since tables arriving later were already finishing their main course and they were preparing pizzas to go to new ‚Ä¶"
20,Il Boccalino, 1 star ,3 years ago,I stumbled upon this place because where I originally wanted to go was fully booked and I was really hungry. I ordered a simple margarita pizza and when it arrived it wasn‚Äôt even cooked properly. You could tell the dough wasn‚Äôt fresh and it ‚Ä¶
21,Il Boccalino, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Told then we had a reservation and they yelled at us saying ""we're full""."
22,Il Boccalino, 3 stars ,3 years ago,They cook for a long time. Tea is bad. The Internet is fast.
23,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,a year ago,The food was very delicious and enough for everybody. The prices are really fair and not too much. The staff were really friendly.
24,Il Boccalino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Absolute rip-off! Disgusting how you can charge 12EUR for a full size pizza? That is not even a full size! I can do better job in heating a frozen pizza from a supermarket. It shouldn't even have a status as restaurant, but simple cheap take-away. Don't go here"
25,Il Boccalino, 1 star ,4 years ago,Avoid like the plague. The waiter would keep trying to push unwanted food and bring more food than explicitly‚Äã asked (and charging for the unwanted extra). The food was salty and tasted like straight from the supermarket. The high price didnt match the low quality of the food. Very bad experience overall.
26,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We visit Amsterdam twice a year for IBC and ISE show. we always come this sweet Italian restaurant at first day and last day. Because of there are great foods and friendly service:) And the restaurant owner always treat us with heart and provide wonderful foods and service for us.
27,Il Boccalino, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Pizza and calzone were average. The 4 stagioni salad was terrible, lettuce, rocket, tomato, cucumber and mozzarella, not the usual 4 stagioni ingredients (see picture). Staff was friendly and price was good for the area (you get what you pay for I guess!)."
28,Il Boccalino, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good prices, good pizza in a quaint and cozy setting. The only downfall is that there always seems to be only one waiter even even the place is jammed, making the service a bit lacking."
29,Il Boccalino, 2 stars ,a year ago,"It could've used some seasoning, it's probably better in the restaurant but when I ordered through uber eats we needed to add a kilo of salt"

33,Il Boccalino, 1 star ,7 months ago,"This place is lying about the time preparation, always 20 min late! I wouldn‚Äôt recommend at all!"
34,Il Boccalino, 1 star ,4 years ago,Probably the worst italian I've ever visited. Pizzas were so decieving (I'm sure they made it the day before) and also the starter was cold.
35,Il Boccalino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A lovely, warm place with good food. The owner was so hospitable. Will come back again if when I'm in the area"
