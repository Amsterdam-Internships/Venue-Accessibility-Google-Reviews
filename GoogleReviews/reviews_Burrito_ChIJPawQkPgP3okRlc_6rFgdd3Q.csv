0,Burrito, 5 stars ,a month ago,Wow we have travels all over eating vegan treats but this really blew us out of the water. Soooo tasty and fresh you can barely believe it’s all plant based! Some of the best vegan Tex mex i have ever experienced!
1,Burrito, 4 stars ,4 months ago,The food was good. I had one of the bowls. The French fries were nice and crispy. Seating was smaller than I expected. There were just 3 small round tables that could seat 2 people each.
2,Burrito, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"My husband was very unhappy with me when I selected a vegan restaurant for lunch. However, after tasting his food (the philuminati burrito), he reluctantly agreed that it was amazing. I got the space cowboy bowl, and it was so flavorful. I …"
3,Burrito, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Very yummy. Diverse menu. All vegan. Great portion sizes. 'Beef' was a tad too salty, but otherwise it was very good. We'll return for sure."
4,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,So I picked this place at random off Google maps. My spouse and I have no idea it was vegan/vegetarian. …
5,Burrito, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Stopped here in route to Albany airport.
I’m sad I found it because it is SO DELICIOUS! I got the philuminati burrito.
Wish these folks could come to my house and make that queso! 🤤 …"
6,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Delicious fresh hand-made vegan burritos. I've tried them all. My personal favorite is Philuminati. Staff is friendly. I love this vegan spot.
7,Burrito, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Small place, great food and quite reasonably priced for Mexican food. Was in and out in less than 10 mins at 6pm on a Saturday night. Will definitely be going here again!!!"
8,Burrito, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"My sadness is that I will not be able to try all the burritos before I leave town. That crispy rice reminded me of paella, which is wonderful. For covid, they have takeout packages, or you can sit at one of the tables out front."
9,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Burrito Burrito, such a great Vegan spot in Troy, NY. There's not a large selection on the menu, but the flavor, the portion size and the atmosphere are TOP NOTCH. The owners are very welcoming and what a cute, cozy place. GrubHub even …"
10,Burrito, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"As an omnivore I was skeptical of my first vegan burrito, but loved it. I've since gone back multiple times and haven't been let down once. These burritos are top notch!"
11,Burrito, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Is this the best restaurant in downtown Troy? Maybe, but I haven't eaten at them all. Is this the best restaurant in my relatively robust sample size of places that offer vegan food? YES. I will say that I've only ever ordered the Feesh …"
12,Burrito, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"After years of enduring, at best decent burritos but without vegan versions of the classic fixings, and at worst flavorless burritos at Bombers, the 518 finally has a legit burrito spot, and it’s all vegan. …"
13,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Amazing unique vegan eats. Always try the special!! Love it all here. Miss the burger tho!
14,Burrito, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Excellent vegan food with an ""out of this world"" twist. Even if you are a ""meat-a-tarian"" you'll want to try their food- it's just that good."
15,Burrito, 4 stars ,a year ago,"They do great business here. I decided to put my life on the line by eating a fried burrito too. I wish I had a heart attack, haha. It's A MUST TRY."
16,Burrito, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Incredibly delicious. Never had vegan meat before so I was slightly nervous how much I'd like this. So so good. And very filling. Normally I can eat a similar sized burrito from a place like Moe's easily and still want more, I was feeling …"
17,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"For the vegan lover this is the place, great food and great service. I love meat so I was disappointed"
18,Burrito, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious vegan food! I ordered online for pick up and it was hot and ready when I got there. Easy food pick up system as well. I’ll definitely be going back!
19,Burrito, 5 stars ,8 months ago,I have to say I definitely didn't know this was a vegan place. Stopped here on a trip for work and I actually wasn't disappointed. Made my order Roswell Style burrito. I am not a vegan nor will be a vegan. Would not have ate here had I known but order before I figured it out. However it was very good. I would consider it again.
20,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,I’ve been plant based for 4 years and this is the first time eating here. I absolutely loved it! My boyfriend is not vegan and can’t wait to go back already. We’ve eaten vegan tacos from many places but nothing compares to these. My …
21,Burrito, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"I'm not a vegetarian, but this burrito was delicious regardless. Even better than that was the service and speed. Took less than 5 minutes from ordering to the window. Definitely a top choice for a quick bite."
22,Burrito, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Eww!  Chose this place because it had 4.9 stars. What?!? I ordered the space cowboy bowl on 2/23 just before 5pm. It tasted old and burnt. The so-called smoked pulled pork was doubtfully actually smoked, but overly-doused with a gross …"
23,Burrito, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Had a chickalo burrito and the philluminati bowl (both with fajita veggies) for our first visit here. Truly delicious food! Everything was exactly what I wanted. Spicy food was spicy, creamy sauces were creamy, all of it was full of flavor. We will definitely be repeat customers!"
24,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,I cannot give burrito burrito a high enough rating! They’ve got the best vegan dishes I’ve found in the area at very reasonable prices. The owner is always so lovely to speak with and knows me when I call. They also offer curb-side pickup …
25,Burrito, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Several weeks after eating here for the first time, we will look at each other and say ""that burrito was really good..."" …"
26,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Absolutely the best! The food is delicious, fresh, unique. Yes it’s vegan - and yes I promise you will love it even if you are only occasionally plant based! :-). The owner and staff are delightful and have been a bright spot in our week during this COVID life!"
27,Burrito, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Is this place an authentic Mexican restaurant? Nope. Does it need to be? Also nope. Is it amazing to be able to go to a place where you don't have to ask questions about ingredients and that you can control the health level of said …
28,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing all-vegan menu. I've tried several of their meals and enjoyed every one. Great, friendly customer service. I wish their seating area was more comfortable, but with Covid happening it doesn't matter much anyway. Quality of food is 10/10."
29,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,I've barely finished wiping the sauce off of my fingers before writing this review...but the world needs to know ASAP that this place is dishing out some unbelievably excellent food! I've been going to Burrito Burrito since around the time …
30,Burrito, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Oh my god, this was SO GOOD. Everything was well seasoned and delicious. I'm not a vegetarian but still loved what I ordered and would come back here in a heartbeat."
31,Burrito, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I posted a negative review, and within 15 minutes the owner called me and made things right. I have not actually had their food, but they have outstanding customer service."
32,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Phenomenal plant based burritos, crunchwraps and more. Super fresh and great sauce to veggies to protein ratios. Soft tortillas. Guac is limey and wonderful. …"
33,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I’ve eaten a lot of vegan burritos in my time and this spot was hands down the most memorable. I got the ‘feesh’ burrito and my word it was as big as a newborn swaddled child in my arms. The crispy ‘fish’ tofu tasted straight from the sea, …"
34,Burrito, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Creative vegan burritos that are tough to finish in one sitting ! Staff is very friendly and accommodating.
35,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,I'm not vegan and I love the food here.  The Philly cheese burrito should have a plaque in the Burrito Hall of Fame.  Is there such a place?  Is there a Nobel Prize for burritos?  It'd be a better world if there was.
36,Burrito, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Literally the best burritos in Troy, regardless of whether you eat a strictly plant-based diet or not. Meat eaters: do not be deterred! I promise you will not be disappointed."
37,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was surprised because this is a vegan place, and I am not vegan at all. The burritos and tacos were really delicious. The meat imitation was better than the real meat in many places. The sauces were clearly excellent additions to the ""dishes""."
38,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,This place is my all time favorite resturant from the burritos to the (wizard burger) burgers and fried pickles everything you could order will exceed your expectations and blow your taste buds out of the water. My meat eating boyfriend …
39,Burrito, 4 stars ,a year ago,"So 4 stars instead of 5 because we need a redo: we each did burritos and they were good but a bit overwhelming--which says A LOT because we LOVE flavor. We need to go back and this time, get tacos so we can handle the strong flavors a …"
40,Burrito, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The best ever, love these guys!! Their rotating specials are always amazing as well!!"
41,Burrito, 4 stars ,11 months ago,This place is open. No dine in currently due to the pandemic. The quality of the food since I first started dining here has changed. The service is always friendly though. Also the menu is quite small.
42,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Vegan food done well is just regular food that happens to not have animal products. The meal was hearty and satisfying with great flavors and portions. Just remember to ask for ""no cilantro"" if you think it tastes like soap.  I always forget."
43,Burrito, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Always supa yummy. Consistent and never disappointing, and my non veg boyfriend asks if we can go there pretty often which is a win for me."
44,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A vegan MUST HAVE. Let me tell you I absolutely loved the food here. They also serve the BIGGEST Burritos I have ever seen. Just ask them what a burrito burrito is. Better bring a friend for that meal.
45,Burrito, 4 stars ,11 months ago,"Very good burritos but also very expensive. Keep in mind I come from a rural area and am in the city for college, so expensive to me may be different from expensive to you. A great place for vegetarian food though"
46,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Everything on the menu is simply amazing. The Soy steak, BBQ jackfruit, and ""Feesh"" (mock fish), were my personal favorites. However the other options like the Seitan, Buffalo were equally satisfying. The side are great too! The staff are …"
47,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I’m not even a vegetarian and I think this place has the best tacos in Troy, if not the tri city area! The southwest burrito bowl is my fav, definitely worth a shot whether you’re a vegetarian or not, you’d never know the difference, and you probably wouldn’t be getting this level of flavor."
48,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Walked in and had to ask what smelled so amazing. ""It's rice"", I was told by the woman behind the counter. Well, that was it, I had to try something with the rice in it. I wound up trying a vegan taco along with rice and beans. Holy moly …"
49,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,First time going and I am so happy this place exists!! Burritos and queso are on point I can’t believe everything is vegan. Will surely become a frequent customer!
50,Burrito, 5 stars ,5 months ago,All nice vegan options... friendly and helpful staff
51,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,So tasty. We got the Buffalo chickpea and the soy steak. We opted for the Burrito Burrito style and they were the biggest burritos I've ever had. We will definitely be back
52,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Yum! I want this in my town. Big, fat, flavorful, super filling burritos, all vegan. We'll make this a regular stop anytime we're in the region. Now really, have you thought about a Mass. outpost?"
53,Burrito, 5 stars ,9 months ago,This place is truly amazing. I think I've had the entire menu at this point and I can't pick a favorite. It's all incredible.
54,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good 100% vegan food. I had a ""steak"" burrito with flavored seitan and my wife had ""fish"" tacos. Both very pleased"
55,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best vegan food I've ever had by far. The dudes who run it are super nice too.
56,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is amazing, one of the best vegan meals I’ve ever eaten. Traveling from Michigan and blown away by this place. Food, vibe and service top notch. Ten stars 🙌🏼"
57,Burrito, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Food was delicious and hard to tell it was vegan, perfect blend of spices and sauces"
58,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I haven't had anything bad here and I adore the entire menu. Their Horchata hits the spot and the staff is always friendly. Only been open for a couple of weeks and it's already one of my favourites in town!
59,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food, portions are big too so you will never leave still hungry,  I've taken a few non-vegan people here for lunch and they all agree how good it is"
60,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tried this for the first time recently, and it is one of my favorite burrito places. I tried their 'fish' burrito, cinnamon roll and horchata. All of the food was DELICIOUS."
61,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,Stopped in for the first time today and ordered the cheese steak burrito.  The burrito was a good size and delicious.
62,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Absolutely DELICIOUS 🤤, the burritos are huge! So worth it! They do a fantastic job. BURITO BURITOooo!🌯"
63,Burrito, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Sooooo freaking good!!!! It reminded me of eating Taco Bell but 1000x better. Really Fast service too.
64,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,The food is soooo good! Some of the best food I’ve had in Troy NY! Would recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal.
65,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My mix of different 3 tacos all WOW'ed... Amazing food! Bonus it's all gluten free and vegan!
66,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food that's one hundred percent plant based. The spicy steak tacos and the nachos are absolutely killer.
67,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A must visit for any vegetarian/vegan/vegetable enthusiast who either lives, works, or is visiting the area. Amazing food. Quick service. Reasonable prices."
68,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,By far the best burger joint Troy has had in the last eight years hands down and NO ONE DIED to make it!!!
69,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,Some of the best vegan food I have ever eaten. If I lived in NY I would spend all of my money here!

71,Burrito, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Ate two burritos here before I realized it was vegan. I rest my case.
72,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious Tex Mex vegan food! I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!
73,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I'm not a vegan, nor am I vegetarian, but the food here is really REALLY delicious!  Highly recommend"
74,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place. New variety on vegan food.
Try the queso. One of the best i have ever tried."
75,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Try this out if your hankering for a burrito or tacos. Damn good Mexican without the Tex Mex spiciness. (I had the Tilapia burrito)
76,Burrito, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Insanely great food.  It’ll change your whole outlook on life.
77,Burrito, 1 star ,2 years ago,It’s not burrito burrito anymore - it’s called koni cafe.. and absolutely no vegan options available like the older place ...
78,Burrito, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Incredible food and very fast service for the quality. If you're vegetarian or vegan, you must try it!"
79,Burrito, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing, high quality flavorful food. Will be going here often!!"
