0,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Enjoy a very good and tasteful pizza, sometimes with a different and original format. Pizzas were very good, me and my family loved it. The personnel was very kind and polite. Prices are average for the area where the place is for a pizza. Totally recommended."
1,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great place for Italian food (especially pizza). Quite crowded and with zero respect for 1,5m rule if you care about it. We heard Italian language around so it means that it is also popular amongst natives."
2,Mangia Pizza, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Big pizza, but well cooked and tasty. Big glasses of Peroni to top it off. A 21YO cat sleeping next to me on the long couch. Service is fast and good. Could be a bit more cozy, but overall good!"

5,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Best veggie Neapolitan pizzas in Amsterdam. Mine and my girlfriends go to when fancying a Friday night pizza. Also great to sit in and eat with a good vibe and friendly staff.
6,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Heaven on earth! Best pizza! The dough is crispy and fluffy. Tasty ingredients and freshly made.
7,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is super well maintained, pizza is so good and the prices are super small, in comparison with other places in Amsterdam. The pizza dow is perfect like in a napoletan pizzeria, the service was good and the limoncello delicios. If i will recommend somethig will be the Mangia Pizza and the Dolci pizza with nutela. Delicious!"
8,Mangia Pizza, 1 star ,2 years ago,"A disappointing visit to a well rated pizza spot.  Service was poor and took a very long time for drinks. appetizers and pizza.  For the appetizers, the bruschetta was seemingly left over pizza dough with some cut tomatoes on top.  Ordered ‚Ä¶"

12,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I enjoyed an amazing Diavola pizza at Mangua Pizza.  The crust was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of char and chewiness. The toppings were very well balanced for a spicy authentic flavor.   I highly recommend!
13,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,a year ago,Excellent choice for that pizza craving. The place offers good sitting capacity and friendly service. Tasty pizza that reminds you of Italy. For more experiences like this follow @quiquinnv

16,Mangia Pizza, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good pizza place! Small restaurant with tasty pizza and good wines. Staff is friendly. Usually busy place so better to have reservation in advance. Especially I recommend the pizza with nutella as desert at the end of the dinnerüòâ
17,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"As an Italian I try to avoid italians restaurant abroad, but this place is like a little slice of Italy in Amsterdam. The pizza is perfect, a real traditional pizza with fresh ingredients!"

19,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Real Neapolitan pizzas in this place. The pizza fritta is also fantastic

24,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best authentic Italian pizza take-away options available in Amsterdam. We were missing an item in our order but, they went above and beyond to ensure we received it quickly. The house pizza is really worth trying."
25,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great pizza, one of the most tasty in Amsterdam. The dough is very light, you don't feel stuffed after eating the pizza.
Staff is very friendly. They also have the first woman pizza baker in the Netherlands."
26,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,a year ago,Highly recommend. Best pizza I have ever had outside of Italy! I am quite particular  person but their menu had such unique flavours and combinations and at good prices.  We absolutely loved the truffle pizza and the one with the cured beef ‚Ä¶
27,Mangia Pizza, 2 stars ,a year ago,Pizza was cold and sloppy and lasagna was burnt. Tried to resolve this on the phone but  restaurant blamed it on Uber driver but the pizza must have been cold when it left the restaurant as I could follow his five minutes trip. ‚Ä¶
28,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent pizza, real Italian recipes and good oven. Staff very friendly. Keep it up guys!!!"

31,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, great staff. Really the best pizza in Amsterdam. Go try for yourself üòÄ"
32,Mangia Pizza, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good pizza, cozy restaurant. I didn't really like our waiter, he was setting the table like he was pissed at us for wanting to eat here, but it wasn't any deal breaker, because the food was very tasty."
33,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very nice and sympathetic co-worker ! We have overlooked an ingredient that we cannot eat unfortunately BUT they were so nice and kind and changed the pizza for us without paying twice! The pizza was very delicious and the ingredients were ‚Ä¶
34,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"For me it is my go to place when I'm searching for quality pizza in Amsterdam. Haven't found a crust in Amsterdam that is so fluffy and amazing. If you like thin crust pizza, this is not the spot to go. Very well priced and they listen to any changes you'd like to make to your pizza. Staff is helpful and quick. Highly recommend!"
35,Mangia Pizza, 1 star ,2 years ago,The card machine was not working and the pizza was mainly burnt. And I don't mean the slightly burnt crust due to baking in the wood-burnt oven. No. This is black. Look yourselves
36,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"A very nice italian place in Amsterdam!

43,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Take away pizzas were ready really fast and were delicious as well! Will definitely be back again soon!
44,Mangia Pizza, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Don't go there if you're vegan. Their vegan pizza is pretty sad, and overall it just tastes like tomato sauce with few random tasteless veggies on top. For 13‚Ç¨ they can do much better, since making a pizza like that costs them probably only 2‚Ç¨. Staff is friendly, but that's mainly it."
45,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We have been to this restaurant several times and it never dissappoints. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating even when they are extremely busy. The pizza reminds us so much of the pizza we had in Naples, Italy. It's like being on vacation to come have dinner here."

48,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,3 months ago,What‚Äôs great pie!   Very good service too.
49,Mangia Pizza, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"This is becoming one of my favourite Pizzeria in Amsterdam. The quality of the pizza is great, there's not a lot of choice, but that's how it works in Italy as well... Just few pizzas but GOOD ones (and no ppineapple around). ‚Ä¶"
50,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,a year ago,"If you look for a real pizzeria, here you can find an authentic pizza Napoletana. The dough is top notch, with a superb crust and an delicious taste. Very friendly staff."
51,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My girlfriend and I dropped by Mangia Pizza on a Wednesday while we were visiting Amsterdam. We saw the 4.5 star rating on trip advisor so we went there to see if it held up to that rating. Upon arriving there were no guests but we went for ‚Ä¶
52,Mangia Pizza, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The pizzeria has potential - the food itself was very good. BUT there were several problems that made our experience unpleasant. First of all, we had to wait about 45 minutes before even getting any water and service. The waitresses didn't ‚Ä¶"

59,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We tried the quattro formagio and margherita pizzas and really enjoyed both. The pizzas here are made in a wood fired oven and the ingredients are of high quality. They are quite large and made to order. That considered, prices are very reasonable."
60,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Authentic Italian pizza. Compared to others places in the city here you can find a large selection of pizza as in any pizzeria in Italia, not just 5/10 flavors created to match locals taste."
61,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great traditional Napolitan pizza. The products used are fresh and recognizable from the Campania region of Italy such as the buffalo mozzarella and the san marzano tomatoes. The dough of the pizza is put together very well according to traditional napolitan ways. Soft and elastic with a thick edge. Perfect

67,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Staff were very welcoming, the place had a nice relaxing atmosphere. I had a diavola pizza which was very nicely done, Neapolitan style.

75,Mangia Pizza, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The food is amazing but our waitress wasn't very welcoming which was quite unfortunate.
76,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We have been to this restaurant several times and it never dissappoints. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating even when they are extremely busy. The pizza reminds us so much of the pizza we had in Naples, Italy. It's like being on vacation to come have dinner here."
77,Mangia Pizza, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The place needs booking in advance, but it's well worthy. The restaurant is a tiny , cosy, very enjoyable place, and the food is terrific! The only let down we had was that none of the desserts on the menu was available to order. And it took quite some time to get what we ordered. Rather than that, perfect!"
78,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Small quaint pizzeria with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Best pizza in Amsterdam. Gets quite busy, so be sure to call ahead and reserve!"
79,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The service was great here! Good pizza we shared one. They have generous portion size.
80,Mangia Pizza, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Went in on a hot day (36 degrees). 2 airconditioning units on the wall were switched on, but didnt work. Maybe just on for show but set on low to save energy. Asked the waitress to switch on properly, but she was just being very unfriendly. Left immediately, since it was hotter than a pizza oven and unbearable to stay"

82,Mangia Pizza, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Ordered on Deliveroo. Was very pleasantly surprised by how good the pizza was. A bit of condensation from being in the box (not uncommon for pizza delivery especially when it isn't ""junkfood pizza"") I would look forward to going to eat in the restaurant."
83,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Small quaint pizzeria with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Best pizza in Amsterdam. Gets quite busy, so be sure to call ahead and reserve!"

I highly recommend the calzone :)"
90,Mangia Pizza, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I might be in the minority but in my opinion the food served was strictly ok. The mangia vegetarian pizza was more like eating dough with cheese filling and tiramisu left a lot to be desired. Doubt if we'll be going back!
91,Mangia Pizza, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Located close to the end of the Vondelpark, it has nice pizzas and good prices. Quite full and noisy, with Italian vibes and special variety of Italian beers. For 2 or big groups."

95,Mangia Pizza, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I saw small insect walking in my to go pizza box. Ok. Can happen. Sometimes you‚Äôre hungry, so you got to eat. Than i found 4/5 slices of salami and a hair on my pizza salami. Come on guys, is this love for food or what is going on?"
96,Mangia Pizza, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The food is amazing but our waitress wasn't very welcoming which was quite unfortunate.
97,Mangia Pizza, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Not my kind of pizza. Neapolitan style. Borders are too thick and high, dough uncooked. The waitress was not really professional."
98,Mangia Pizza, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ridiculous long wait for two brick oven pizzas... they actually got the order wrong with one of the pizzas and provided a calzone instead of pizza which was not cooked thru. Did not give it a one star because think it was because the waitress that was servicing us was new she kept asking other staff for help.
99,Mangia Pizza, 1 star ,a year ago,"got fried pizzas here a few times and they were good but this time ordered them via takeaway service from the same restaurant and it was terrible- soaked in some fritur fat and overfried, gave us stomach pain"

103,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great spot. Regret not coming here sooner. Always went to a pizza spot a couple doors down but Mangia is definitely better. Better quality, better price and a real Italian experience :)"
104,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really good pizza. But the delivery service from Thuisbezorgd is not prompt at all which makes the pizza not tasty anymore as complained by most other customers I learned from the restaurant owner. Thanks for the restaurant owner's ‚Ä¶
105,Mangia Pizza, 1 star ,2 years ago,Pizza is quite good. But the service is horrible. We ordered from home and after one hour and half waiting they cancelled the order... we called them for clarification and a employer was very extremely rude. Clients lost
106,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Real italian pizza from real Italians, or... the best pizza in town!! Everything on the menu is amazing but if you order the Mangia Pizza you will be treated with the best one on the menu ü§ò"

114,Mangia Pizza, 1 star ,10 months ago,Reservation on their website doesn‚Äôt work. You get the confirmation of your reservation on the terrace but the place is close to dine in.
115,Mangia Pizza, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice pizza! I am Italian living in Amsterdam and I enjoyed it. Salsiccia and friarielli was a real and proper one!
116,Mangia Pizza, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Would avoid if you are a tourist, did not receive good service. We got pizza but did not particularly enjoy it. Overall not a great experience. The only good part was the cat that wanders around the restaurant"

118,Mangia Pizza, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Fast and good service. Pizzas were delicious!
