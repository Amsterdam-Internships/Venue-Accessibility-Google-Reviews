5,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,7 months ago,A wonderful all around experience! The staff was super friendly and welcoming. The food was all excellent and the wine pairings all worked well with the dishes. The Dutch cheese platter and Hemelse Modder chocolate dessert were some highlights that most exceeded their descriptions but everything was good.
6,hemelse modder, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"We had shrimp bisque with garlic foam (to die for), I had lamb with pistachio add main dish (excellent too) with the signature french fries, cheese (not worth it. I'll explain below), and the Hemelse Modder dessert which is no other than 3 ‚Ä¶"

12,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The best meal of our stay in Amsterdam.  Wonderful flavours; great presentation and excellent service.
13,hemelse modder, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Went as a team here and we really enjoyed it. Good selection of dishes (including vegetarian). Very friendly staff. Zeer lekerüëç
14,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We had the pleasure of joining the team on their birthday so there was a special menu. The food was amazing and the citrus cream dessert was possibly the best I've ever had.

18,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food served is excellent, but when the restaurant is busy you'll need to wait. Portions are not oversized, so you can make it to dessert. Their formula is a 3 course menu for a set price. If you take only two courses there is a slight ‚Ä¶"
19,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Always excellent. Probably my third trip. The menu is always interesting and I usually want to eat it all. Relaxed unfussy professional service. The wine list is short but everything is interesting. Go! Now !
20,hemelse modder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great if you want to try the local cuisine. Choice from 3 portions is just the right amount (choice wisely though, don‚Äôt go with all heavy options if not too hungry). The bouillon isn‚Äôt my thing, rather salty and flavourless. But the duck, stew and fish were solid. The desserts were very small but good."
21,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was exquisite in flavor, unique combinations of ingredients.  Staff was wonderful.  Atmosphere relaxed.  Part of the ambiance is to take your time and enjoy so expect to spend some time there.  Well worth the anticipation (looked up ‚Ä¶"

23,hemelse modder, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"No amazing dishes but a nice meal. Good price/quality. The ""hemelse modder"" as a dessert is very nice. Wouldn't order the fries as extra anymore, because they are a bit dry and the rest is well-portioned"
24,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I love this place. Very friendly staff great food. Very accomodating. Not over the top fancy just good healthy eating with great wine arrangement at reasonable prices...there are a few of these down to earth restaurants in Amsterdam... Make use of them.
25,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Delicious flavours in a cute place, with a kind, warm service. Superbe."
26,hemelse modder, 4 stars ,a month ago,Lovely fresh food during lockdown
27,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Restaurant, food,  staff were all amazing!"
28,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,5 years ago,We enjoyed a lovely evening over four courses. The service was delightfully friendly and each course was creative and tasty. We felt as though the portions were more than large enough. The paired wines were also very well selected.
29,hemelse modder, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Reserved a table for 10 persons with only 7 people showing up. When the check came, the restaurant charged us with 3 extra 3 course meals (120 euro!) . They did not tell us ahead of time they will charge extra, also they did not cook those courses! On top of this the restaurant was half empty anyway. We felt basically scammed.."
30,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Certain days in a week I eat vegan, and this was one of those days. Normally I don't eat outside because of the limited choices and the quality is poor. This time it was an exception and therefore my expectations were quite low. BUT the food was wonderfull, very tasty and an excellent service. So also a very good place for vegans!"
31,hemelse modder, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We had the rudest male server when we came in last night. I couldn‚Äôt believe how condescending he was when we wanted to order drinks. He said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a restaurant, not a bar. So, I‚Äôll get your check right now.‚Äù It was easily worst service I‚Äôve seen in over 20 countries. I strongly recommend finding another place."

34,hemelse modder, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"A restaurant with a very good reputation, but I'm not so sure it's worth going there to eat. I tried it because it was just a few doors away from where I was staying, but I found it disappointing. I think the chef/owner tries to be too ‚Ä¶"
35,hemelse modder, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Excellent, stable value for over 30 years!"
36,hemelse modder, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good place, good price, good wine selection, amazing service. Food a bit too traditional. E.g. lam was cooked with its fat and skin...It is within the concept of the restaurant, but those who had it from my group left it all on the plates untouched."
37,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome food and wonderful ambience...
38,hemelse modder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"As an American this was a very nice place. It was a traditional place and the dinner was slow paced. Very good, we were there two and a half hours when we finally decided we needed to speed things up. I would go back again when I wasn't as tired."
39,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent dutch cooking. The setting is modern but enjoyable. We never regretted the short walk (500 m) from our hotel, although we crossed a lot of other restaurants on our path."
40,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great value for money for dutch food
41,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Great restaurant to eat Dutch style food.The restaurant is a bit hard to find but well worth it! My cod fillet with white asparagus were great! And the chocolatemousse for dessert was fantastic! Friendly attentive staff!
42,hemelse modder, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Service took forever for a main course. When we asked what was taking so long, the server replied in a snobby way, ""Then you should've taken a starter. This isn't fast food."" The servings were incredibly small. If you want to feel full after a meal, don't waste your time here."
43,hemelse modder, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Food quality was good but the quantity was a bad joke... very very small dishes with nothing to eat !

46,hemelse modder, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Disappointed with the quality of the food here , my fish was chewy and the side potatoes tasted as if they have been reheated. The steak tartar egg was too hard boiled. The service and staff were nice."
47,hemelse modder, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"I was sitting there with a friend few weeks ago, and it was nice. But... As much as you can expect from Dutch food, as tasty and high quality as the food is - the size and quantity of food is not enough, and not worth the prize paid. I ‚Ä¶"

49,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely meal. Accommodating to my allergies. Nice wine pairings. A total surprise tucked away in the center of AMSTERDAM
50,hemelse modder, 1 star ,6 years ago,"When we asked the waiter if we could share a 35‚Ç¨ menu between two, he said this wasn't a kindergarten. The food was good but you had to search for it with a microscope. Avoid if possible..."
51,hemelse modder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A truly delightful restaurant in Amsterdam. My dinner was exquisite and it was lovely to sit in the back terrace on a summer's evening. I highly recommend this restaurant and hope to return soon.
