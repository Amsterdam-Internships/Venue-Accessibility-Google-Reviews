0,Stadskantine, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I like this place. It's always full of students and people working so I like the enviroment. They also have a lot of board games to use. Really recommended the quiche or the Noodle soup. The only problem why I don't give 5 stars is that ‚Ä¶
1,Stadskantine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Such a comfortable place to have a drink and work. They also serve different fresh dishes everyday. After the drink, we tried a vegetarian meal; the pumpkin lasagna with feta and mushroom, served with salad on the side and it was delicious!"
2,Stadskantine, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"You gotta order a sandwich here! Great taste, not overpriced. At the windows you can work on your laptop, or relax and talk to strangers at the large table."
3,Stadskantine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A great place to eat and /or drink, quite industrial in style and attracts a friendly and mixed clientele.  The food we had on this visit was really exceptional - tasty and excellent value for money. One of our party had some specific ‚Ä¶"
4,Stadskantine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, amazing view and light. Perfect for studying, working, lunch, dinner, everything!"

6,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Simple but good food in a school-canteen-like atmosphere. Situated on a corner it has seating across the whole window, allowing for great views of the street while you eat or drink. Double espresso and cheese cake for dessert were fine too. Selection of bottled beers and wine available."
7,Stadskantine, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is good to come and work, but the food leaves something to be desired.  My salad was limp with dry chicken and drenched in oil. WiFi cut on and off the whole time.  You have to bus your own tables."
8,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice place where you can choose dishes for your lunch or dinner. You can be full just pay around 20 euro. It could be soup, some vegetable add-on with meet or fish and a bottle of beer. I was enjoy to have a dinner there and after you can go to the city center and continue your exploring."
9,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Nice restaurant with an unconventional way of serving. It's good quality food and there's a choice of 3 different meals each day. Its a bit like a school caffettiera but with better food. Great place for a cheap meal.
10,Stadskantine, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a cheap place that offers sandwiches and Thai food. Italian too. they offer a lot, so for a big group of people this might work. ‚Ä¶"
11,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,4 years ago,I go here for my lunchtime sandwich which is freshly made and really good. Usually quite busy. They serve full meals here also. Interior decor is basic but nice.
12,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I like it, nice place to work. Good food, not very expensive. Music is decent but apparently with the wifi you have an option to choose music. ‚Ä¶"
13,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good, nutritious fare. Location is convenient, and the interior is basic but nice. I sometimes come here to work on my laptop. Priced very reasonably thanks to self-service."
14,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Spacious, cheap coffee, good temperature, large table space, good music volume. Internet is slow however, and limited to either 3 or 8 hours, depending on whether the barista likes you."
15,Stadskantine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I came by on a Saturday evening for dinner. The restaurant has a cozy feel to it and wasn't too crowded. The staff was very friendly and I ordered the baked salmon and potatoes. Would definitely come again!
16,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The place has a school-cafeteria vibe to it. You order at the bar and take your food with a tray to your table. Different food options are offered every day next to the regular menu. All very fresh!
17,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Calm and laid-back place. Food was comforting and tasty, nothing outrageous but home-cooked food. The desert is very thick therefore aren't everyone's taste and No cash at all."
18,Stadskantine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place where to have lunch and to work in an easy environment. Seating comfort could be  improved with better chairs but that‚Äôs being picky. I like the big windows arrangement!
19,Stadskantine, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to work, good wifi, and coffee isn't that bad. Food isn't that great though. I had the lasagne and it was a bit too salty. No table service."
20,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The space felt relaxing, it is beautifully organized with large wooden tables and big windows all around. The food was better than average and fairly cheap, but not remarkable."
21,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place in the pijp for a quick bite or a drink. Perfect spot for those who want a place to study or work. Food is very standard,   price quality. Normal products for a normal price."
22,Stadskantine, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Lovely and calmed place to have a coffee and work with your laptop. The food is good and the price is on the average for this city. Recommended for students and creatives.
23,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place to study. Prices are reasonably cheap because of the self-service. The sandwiches are amazing, good quality of ingredients!"
24,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice location, good view of busy street, but wifi is only 1 hour long. I like to do my uni work there. Short internet duration works good if you have work to do."
25,Stadskantine, 1 star ,6 years ago,"The definition of an awful service... The service is better at Febo... was in a hurry, told the guy that I wouldn't take a toasted sandwich (7min) but another one cause I had only 15min to have lunch, he served 5 other people before he ‚Ä¶"
26,Stadskantine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Casual and relaxing atmosphere. Great vibe to the place, good music, and loved their food. Went for breakfast and came back for lunch."
27,Stadskantine, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Superb cheesecake, good value breakfast menus and an extra plus for a creative way if asking for tip where you can try to balance your coins on a lemon in water to enter a prize draw."
28,Stadskantine, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Great concept. Good, nutritious, fast food, choice of fish, meat or veg for dinner.  Soup, salad and dessert if you want. No cash."

31,Stadskantine, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Disappointing quality of the food. Overcooked buffet food without strong tastes, small portions. The WiFi was ok."
32,Stadskantine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, great cooking for good prices and free wi-fi. Suggested for students and for working people"
33,Stadskantine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This used to be an extention of my living room. A no nonsense place, where you can work, chill, read a newspaper or have a quick dinner. You‚Äôre severely missed!"
34,Stadskantine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place to grab a bite and get some work done. They have WiFi and indoor and outdoor seating.
