0,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 4 stars ,a year ago,"This falafel sandwich on wheat  roll was good. It was a lot, I couldn’t finish it all. I didn’t like that it was very messy falling out the roll sauce was all over my hands. The workers were friendly. I got there early before the crowd arrived. This place can get very crowded  during lunch time."

5,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,By far my absolute favorite falafel place in the city and I've tried a bunch. Not a whole lot of seating but for lunch I've found more tend to carry out and maybe even same for dinner but regardless I've never had trouble finding a spot. …
6,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is definitely my new favorite kosher spot whenever I am in the city in Philadelphia they have amazing falafel sandwiches and a great salad to go along with it as well. Very friendly staff and the line usually isn't too big it's just a …
7,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is the best, most amazing falafel sandwich I've ever had!! Incredibly fast service! Their falafel is so fresh and full of flavor! Their pita is pillowy and it does perfectly with their super smooth and flavorful hummus. They are always …"
8,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best falafel in Philly, hands down. Also if you love boardwalk fries, the five minutes these take to make fresh are well worth the wait. Amazing vegan options, including the baklava!"
9,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best falafel in the city hands down. I can not recommend this place enough. Even meat eaters will be happy here. The staff is lovely and have given free samples while I waited on a long line. The worst part is the seating, there is not …"

11,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best falafel outside of Israel. Not even close. Food is very fresh and service is quick. Gets pretty crowded during peak lunchtime but line moves quickly. Credit cards are not accepted so make sure to bring cash.
12,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This places is the BEST! Once you try it, you start to have very specific cravings for it. When my body screams ""go to Mama's for a falafel platter"" I listen. Everything is always fresh & delicious. Prices are good, quality is consistent, portions are perfect. EAT HERE!!"
13,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We normally try not to re-visit restaurants when we go on trips - especially in a city like Philly where there are just so many great restaurants - but we couldn't help it with Mama's... The falafel is too good. We visited around lunch time …
14,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the large falafel sandwich. The falafel balls aren’t bad, average quality, but the sandwich as a whole is insipid — and overpriced at $8 for the underwhelming quality. The slaw added to the sandwich is tasteless, the hot sauce and …"
15,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"BEST falafels in Philly-- you have the option of getting a falafel pita or falafel salad. The falafels are well cooked and super tasty. We got the pita and it was delicious!!! The different spicy sauces were so good, definitely ask for a few of them to try it. The  place is small but enough room for a sit down meal with friends."
16,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The wife and I love the falafel here. Always delicious and fresh and the staff are very courteous. Very affordable for Rittenhouse as well. Some complain about the cash only part, but it’s to be expected with these smaller businesses. If the ATM surcharge is that deep, walk 1 min to Wawa and pull money out there with no surcharge lol."
17,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The falafels here are always fresh and always delicious. Service is super nice but sometimes a bit scatter brained. Come expecting a wait, but that's because they only serve their falafels fresh out of the frier and crunchy. Delicious and unbelievably cheap"
18,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Listen if you’re in Philly! You have to stop here for food! I’ve had falafel everywhere  but it’s hard to find Falafel as delicious as Mama vegetarian! Their food is fresh as hell! ALWAYS! Their falafel is absolutely delicious! Unmatched! They deserve more stars!
19,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Love this place. It's a simple menu with nice people working in there. I always get the spicy falafel on wheat. They also make fresh carrot juice and fries. Yummy.
20,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing falafel, on par with Amsterdam Falafel in DC, and much better than Goldie's in Philly.  Nearly as good as the best I found in Israel.  I would absolutely wait in their fast moving line again.  In fact, after I finished my falafel salad plate I waited in line again to get falafel pita!  I just which they offered baba ghanoush."
21,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great falafel and latkes. The Samantha's platter is the way to go. The actual prices are a dollar more than the yelp reviews indicate. But overall an overall great experience and the staff really are extremely helpful. This is a must visit
22,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 1 star ,2 years ago,The staff was nice initially and then it went bad. They did not wash their hands before touching the pita bread. When I told the employee she responded rudely and said all of the employees touch the pita bread with their bare hands. She …
23,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's a little regimented in the ordering experience and hard to get a table, but man does Mama's deliver. The falafel sandwiches are huge and delicious!  I always envy my co-workers who have made a lunchtime trip."
24,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best falafels in center city. Also, when compared to Goldie (also a top tier falafel place) the service is so much better and incredibly fast. The line moves so quickly.. Just remember, they are cash only"
25,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fast and efficient service, although it wouldn't hurt the staff to smile every now and then. Excellent falafel and the kuba is very impressive too. Limited menu but it's all very tasty!"
26,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We met with friends at this place for lunch. my friend recommended this place.  Well, it was very nice.

27,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Magnificent place for vegetarians and carnivores alike. I'm a meat eater and this is one of my favorite lunch spots in the city. Homemade pita bread, great falafel with lots of veggies, pickle bar with spicy whole peppers. Be prepared for a fast moving line most days at lunch."
28,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I absolutely LOVE the authencity of this place. The food is mind blowing to the point that they have a line out the door everyday for lunch. With every sandwich they give u little cup for fresh fruits and acutramae which is awesome. …
29,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good falafel. Not as hyped as they make it sound when you talk to folks about it. There are some good alternatives even from chains. Just down the road nafnaf is a great option for falafel and has a few more things on the menu. In a competing world, mama's should start thinking of adding value one way or another"
30,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"BEST FALAFEL in philadelphia so far.

Wife and I either share the mama falafel platter and/or falafel sandwich. …"
31,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The falafel, grape leaves, and salads are off the charts fabulous. A great inexpensive meal. The store is spotless, but tiny and very uncomfortable. However, the food is so delicious, its worth the hassle."
32,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Being the good Jewish boy I am, I completely respect a restaurant being closed or closing early for Jewish holidays.  What I don't respect is going to a restaurant at 6:30 pm, when they close at 7:30pm, to be completely disappointed.  We …"
33,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is the best place for pitas and falafel in Philly. Cheap and delicious! They only take cash though so make sure you take some out ahead of time. The pitas are huge and fresh.
34,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food.  Quick for getting a bite for lunch at work.  Small little shop.  Not a big menu, but never been disappointed in their food.  Fries are awesome and made to order.  Not expensive either."
35,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nathan Phieffer is a jerk for giving this place a 1 star review.

He said the food and service was good, you can't give a bad review based on …"
36,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best falafel on this side of the Atlantic. If they put fries in the pita and offered Lafa bread it would be 100% the same as it is served in Israel. The fruit juices are good but pretty sweet if you aren’t used to them. Make sure to take …
37,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Always busy around lunchtime. Service is fast and friendly.  Food is fresh and well seasoned.  I often get the latke sandwich - spicy. It's very filling and enjoyable.  They are cash only.
38,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It's amazing falafel and vegetarian store! Prices are reasonable and good for a quick bite. Plus it's Kosher! Just make sure you have cash because they don't accept credit cards!
39,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Great food and quick service. But to only accept cash and then have an ATM IN THE STORE THAT CHARGES $2.50 PER TRANSACTION, (as seen in the 360° picture up top) is ridiculous and dishonest! (And many banks will charge an additional fee for using a random ATM.)  They may as well accept cards and jack up the prices!"
40,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I walked past this restaurant last week and saw the line out the door so what is yelper to do??? …
41,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I thought I had found some of the best falafal elsewhere in Philadelphia, and boy was I wrong. If you're vegetarian, or simply love falafal, this place is heaven. I completely understand why there was a line out the door when I went here, …"
42,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Mama’s is traditional street food falafel served in foil and wrapped perfectly for one the go eating or just eating there. The pickled salad bar is on point from pickled hot peppers to pickled endives. Needless to say they are always …
43,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Couldnt tell you what the food tasted like.

45,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Perfect meal for vegetarians and others as well. Try small mamas falafel for 5$. Its amazing how much you can get for 5$. The food is delicious and filling. Dont miss free salad bar and fried chilly.
46,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Soooo good.  Had the falafel and had it spicy.  Not much room.  You order and eat it probably standing up by their sidebars, but the food was so good and authentic.  Their spicy sauce is indeed spicy.  Soooo good....."
47,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,No other felafel compares to mama’s! Tastes so authentic and delicious. Happy I walked over there during my stay in center city. Great place to get lunch.
48,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"my favorite falafel place yet. excellent sandwiches, hummus, veggies, sauces. oh the hot sauce and white sauce is to die for. and a salad bar to add your favorite fixings like pickles and peppers. so sad i moved away from the phila area bcz i loved this place. excellent!"
49,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This 1 star rating is not a reflection of the food which is delicious.  Nor, is it representative of the ""entire"" staff which until today has been more than pleasant.  This 1 star rating, is for the 1 employee that provided me with the 1 …"
50,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The place does not look like much, in fact it does not look inpressive at all, but I really like thier food. The latkas can be made spicy, which I really like. The place is always full and many days a line out the door at lunch hour. They are closed for all Jewish holidays and I think 2 of the holidays they are closed for a week."
51,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Absolutely incredible food and very large portions! Everything is so delicious. Personal favorite is the falafel platter with some fried eggplant on the side.
52,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Best balls in the city! The service is always great. I feel right at home every time. The owner is extremely charming and generous. I can't wait to visit again. Get the carrot juice. It'll keep you regular.
53,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"This review is not necessarily reflective of the food. It is reflective of unprofessional and unpleasant service. I ordered a catering service two days in advanced to arrive at 11:30 for our event. We called multiple times, but the company …"
54,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 1 star ,10 months ago,"It was the best place ever now it's closed down for good so sad 😢
PS please let me know if you reopen I will change my review to a 5 star because they had the best food."
55,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Small busy kosher falafel place...prices went up a bit...the pita is okay...the real deal is to get just a combo of falafel balls and hummus for 4 dollars..and then they have a free pickle/veggie bar with condiments..the fries look really good..but the eggplant and latkes are too fried
56,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,6 years ago,This is one of my favorite cheap eats in philly. Get the spicy falafel and enjoy. The line can be long sometimes but it moves fast. And a free pickle bar with your order!
57,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"While this place is not perfect, it effectively strikes a very delicate balance for me in terms of quality, nutrition, price, and taste. A few cents more and I would consider it over-priced for what it is. The ingredients are just balanced enough and fresh enough for me to be willing to pay the listed price."
58,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,They have the best falafels!! They are absolutely delicious and the rest of their food is good too. And the staff is very courteous and friendly and helpful
59,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Best falafel in the city plain and simple. Just judge by the long line around lunch time. Love this place. Fries are really good too.

62,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had the falafel sandwich and falafel platter. The falafel was a bit soft in the sandwich but crispy in the salad. The crispy one I perfected better. Great salad bar tho!
63,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Food never disappoints. Some of the best falafel and latkes I've had. Service was a bit slow today, but the quality and value of the food far overshadowed it."
64,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"fabulous prices, a taste that cannot be beat evidently they make the falafel fresh !! better than I've had in a long time reminds me of Israel"
65,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best falafel in town, even after all the new competition. They have raised prices recently but still a good deal for quality food."

67,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a really small restaurant with just a few tables, and they don't have a wide selection of food, but what they make they make well. The falafel is really good!"
68,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is the best falafel!!! I thought I didnt like falafels until I tried their latki falafel with their homemade coleslaw on top. I moved out of the city and still think about this place all the time.
69,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I go here for their amazing falafel sandwiches. And their pickle bar, with pickled radishes, and all kinds of things. And the music they play rocks in a great way."

72,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food and once saw the cook come out and physically remove a guy who was trying to get money from customers. Overall a great experience. CASH ONLY though so make sure to hit the ATM.
73,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Food A+
Attitude a solid 0....may be a prejudice by a particular employee against patrons that are not Jewish. …"
74,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Seriously good falafel.  I do feel the falafel truck on 20th and market is the best in the city.  But, if your looking for a traditional falafel, this is the place to go hands down!!!!!"

78,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The only reason im giving a 4 out if five is because i cant give a 4 9/10 because the hot sauce is a tad bit too spicy,but overall,amazing falafel and foods."
79,Mama's vegiarian kitchen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good prices, however, customer service was rude, i.e., acting like they were too busy and a customer asking questions was an annoyance.  CASH ONLY business, which I find an inconvenience....they should accept cards AND cash.  The main killer, for me, was the rudeness.  Won't go back."

“White or wheat?”
“Wheat please.” …"
