0,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Came for Sunday brunch and had the most amazing chicken and waffles. The chicken texture is spot on and had a nice cornflake crust. The waffles are buttery and 'melt-in-your-mouth'. Was completely empty besides me which surprised me a bit. ‚Ä¶

2,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great vegan restaurant! Even my non-vegan boyfriend loved the food. You can sit outside and watch people walking by. We had a a sandwich, a burger, cheese fries, a milkshake, soft ice and a cookie dough cookie. Everything tasted amazing and ‚Ä¶"
3,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Beautiful setup, lovely interior, nice staff and very friendly. The White Russian and my burger was so good. Definitely coming back."
4,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Deliscious burger with quinoa and beer beans! The beyond burger was also super good! Vegan Walk Amsterdam top stop!!
Went back again, tried new burgers and dessert, sooo good!!! Nacho Burger was amazing (i removed the coriander garnish) and cheese sauce is deliscious!!"
5,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing vegan Burgers we got here. You have to go there this place is fantastic. Super sweet pink interior and comfy. But the food is...

7,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"So; The food was delicious, the price was very fair, the staff was kind and very good even though only one server was working to serve half the place filled, quite impressive. Their English is flawless for those who care and so is most ‚Ä¶"

They have the best vegan cakes and treats in Amsterdam and their food is all round to die for, if you are vegan or even if you're not, Deer mama is a MUST!!!!!!!"
9,Deer Mama, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The milkshakes are fun and worth a visit. The staff is great and very friendly. But, don‚Äôt bother with the food‚Äî expensive and not very fresh. It seems the kitchen is doing more assembly than cooking.  The burgers can be made better at home."
10,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious and indulging dishes, great milkshakes, good coffee, very friendly service. Galaxy pancakes were incredibly delicious. Ramen nooodles are very flavourful but quite spicy. Overall this place is amazing and worth a second and third visit."
11,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I came here for lunch before heading to the Rijkmuseum and Deer Mama is a fantastic vegan restaurant serving lots of healthy options. The menu is not extensive, but I always say it's better to do a few things well than to do many things ‚Ä¶"
12,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Friendly staff, good food, and if you got a sweet tooth you should try out their ""milkshakes"". The quinoa burger could do with a bit more bite, but the fried chicken and waffles were on point. Great for when you just started being vegan... Pardon the terrible photography from my side..."

17,Deer Mama, 3 stars ,a month ago,"It's nice that it's all vegan, but the burgers are very plain, I'm recommending to make it a bit more delicious and saucy."
18,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Omg one of the best vegan restaurants in Amsterdam! I looooved the chocolate cookie dough milkshake, the banh mi as well as the char siur ü§§ we went there twice because it was so good! All the cakes and cupcakes looked super yummy as well. ‚Ä¶"
19,Deer Mama, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was incredibly friendly, interior looks very cute, but the food was not what could've been. We ordered the BBQ and the Tempea burgers with both sweet potato and regular fries, the Mushroom Croquettes, the Ginger Beer Float and ‚Ä¶"

23,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really enjoyed this place! The burgers are amazing, but so is everything else!

Also super friendly staff and amazing service! The lady serving us was super cute as well"
24,Deer Mama, 2 stars ,3 years ago,We really wanted to love this place but unfortunately the food was not that good. Amsterdam‚Äôs competitive dinning scene has so much amazing food to offer so I‚Äôm sure we won‚Äôt be back to Deer Mama. The service was great and everyone was ‚Ä¶
25,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Omg where should I begin!!! Deer mama offers the best beyond meat burger ever: incredible texture and taste that will make you question whether it‚Äôs actual meat or not.

28,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Okay this is a weird thing to share but we came here mostly because we needed to use the restroom and ended up sitting to order coffee. My brother decided to order a burger, we had no idea that the place was vegan we didn't think much of ‚Ä¶"
29,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I had the Green Monster with sweet potatoes, I wish the portion was bigger. The food was good. The place was too cold and not really cozy. The whole vegan concept was cool though."
30,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely place for milkshakes, waffles, pancakes, and more! It is a bit on the pricey side, with just one donut being 4,50‚Ç¨. However, I had a meal here with my wife; a milkshake and three tacos (rather unconventional fillings like pineapple) ‚Ä¶"
31,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great Vegan burger and sandwich place. A bit out of town but worth it. Had their Vietnamese flavoured char siu Banh Mi which was absolutely delicious. Burgers are quite popular as well. Their cakes looked better than they tasted. The interior is quite pretty and artistic with paintings.
32,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Vegan milkshakes and burgers. What is there not to like? Incredibly delicious! Mama‚Äôs double cheesy burger will undoubtedly satisfy even the hungriest person in the crew.

41,Deer Mama, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was nice but not the best.
Service was okay. We waited very long tome to get our burgers as they were forgottenü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Price/performance is not good."
42,Deer Mama, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Honestly the worst customer service here ever, we went in on a sunday for milkshakes and it was dead, the staff was just talking to eachother for 25 mins before we asked them if anyone was going to serve us. The girl that ended up serving ‚Ä¶"

44,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome place! Wonderful interior design, it has that american style diner vibe we all know well from the movies. The staff is very nice and friendly. The food is super tasty, but the absolute winner is the mylkshake! A-MAZING!"
45,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,They offer a super nice range of feel good food. The pulled jackfruit & the black bean burgers were both outrageous. And their home made soft serve was the cherry on the pie(they also do amazing pies btw) ‚Ä¶
46,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Delicious vegan meals of generous sizes. They provide with paper boxes and bags to take away what you cannot consume at the spot. The milkshakes are pretty good, and the staff is very friendly. Recommended."
47,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty nice, since everything is vegan. We had the thai burger which had different flavours than regular burgers, yet not totally to our taste."
48,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Really tasty extensive vegan menu with lots of sweet things and desserts as well as burgers and other mains! Best milkshake I've ever had. The interior is so cute and the person who served me was incredibly sweet. Will be back next time I'm in amsterdam!

70,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best cookie I had. Amazing! Would just recommend them to use paper takeaway cup instead of plastics :)
71,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Finally got round to visiting this place for food! I don't think I've ever wanted to try absolutely everything on a menu before. We ordered 2 special milkshakes which were both awesome and such a treat, I miss having milkshakes a lot and ‚Ä¶"
72,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing vegan options! The chocolate peaunut brownie and Ethiopian coffee with almond milk have a piece my heart.
73,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,This place is a must for vegans in Amsterdam. Actually you don‚Äôt have to be a vegan to enjoy it. Perhaps you will turn plant based once you try their delicious meat alternatives. I have isited twice for brunch and had the vegan big ‚Ä¶

76,Deer Mama, 2 stars ,a year ago,"The staff was really friendly but the food was really cold, as if they didn‚Äôt even heat it up before assembling the dishes. We had the club sandwich and the mama‚Äôs champion, which was missing the black beans. Also the avocado didn‚Äôt taste ‚Ä¶"

81,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely staff! They have a large menu, with lots of options for lunch and dinner! The milkshakes are really tasty and worth all the calories on it. They put the cakes at the entrance, so you just fall in love with it when you arrive!"

83,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing food, kind service, great interior design!"
84,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Love the atmosphere, 'pink retro diner' style. The vegan burgers are amazing. Shakes and cakes are too sweet for my liking. Pancakes a pretty good & filling!"

86,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent quality food, great presentation and the taste of the dishes is almost too delicious! We had the kidney bean quinoa burger with cassave fries, which was heavenly good. Plus the tempeh ramen bowl, which came down from vegan food ‚Ä¶"
87,Deer Mama, 3 stars ,a year ago,Vegane Burger Not Not creamy enoug. The Taste of the Paddy is fantastic
88,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My favourite vegan restaurant in Amsterdam! I especially love the massive cake assortiment. I tried many already and they were all great. And they have a vegan white russian milkshake!! It's incredible! They also sell a variety of burgers ‚Ä¶
89,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really enjoyed this place! I had the pulled mushroom burger, and it is literally the best I have ever had. I usually find mushroom burgers very disappointing but this was juicy and had layers of flavour. I opted for a side of grill veggies ‚Ä¶"

91,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Probably my favorite vegan place in town, every single item on the menu is amazing but I would say I love their sweet treats the most!

94,Deer Mama, 2 stars ,a year ago,"The food is awesome, it's our 4th time there.. but the service should really be improved. We were the only customers, it was cold outside so we asked the waitress to close it. She did but showed she wasn't happy about it... then she put the AC on so it made things worse. Just a bit of empathy would've been great."
95,Deer Mama, 1 star ,2 years ago,"For some reason, my initial review could not be shared after I edited including a response to a reply of the owner. Here it is again, in short. ‚Ä¶"
96,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great service, great food and oedipus beer. Love it!"
97,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good vegan good!!! Not the standard burgers but really creative and everything is homemade. The appetizers and milkshakes are also really amazing. They have been open for a few weeks and I already went there 3 times.
98,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fun concept with great flavor. Who would‚Äôve thought a tahini milk shake could be so yummy?! Everything we tried from burgers to shakes and sides were good. The only downside was the ice cream machine broke while we were there so we could only try one type of shake. Very friendly service.
99,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice food and great service, lovely little place to relax and lost of food choice. Reasonable prices too and not fair from the met."
100,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A fantastic new addition to the Amsterdam vegan scene. Not for the overly health conscious, but incredibly delicious. The new tacos are to die for -- the best vegan Mexican food I've ever had. The banh mi are great, as is the tofu scramble. Having the chicken and waffles on my next visit..."

104,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved it so much that I went back within a week! Food is absolutely delicious, staff is super friendly, and the price to portions ratio is great too. I already know I‚Äôll become a regular there! And they have the best golden turmeric latte I‚Äôve ever had in my life."
105,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Amazing vegan milkshakes and food and super friendly staff :)
106,Deer Mama, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Our experience was not so amazing. We had to wait 1,5 hours for our burgers. I got the wrong burger and it was a tiny portion, since i am glutenfree i was given salad leaves instead of a gf burger bun.. The milkshake was nice though! Also the dishes and sidedishes are on the pricey side."
107,Deer Mama, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place and modern interior. We were there the day after they opened. The food was served on time, but a bit disappointing. It was cold and missed some love. We also ordered the cookie dough cookie for ‚Ç¨4,-, and got a tiny cookie. ‚Ä¶"

109,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you enjoy going to VJFB then this is truly the place for you! The staff is so nice, the food is amazing, they offer a wide variety  of options and the vegan milkshakes were amazing. The prices are about the same as any other burger tent, milkshakes are a bit pricey but it ended up being worth it for sure. Great ambiance aswell."
110,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Omfg this was my favorite food find! I had been to junk food bar before (which is a must, too) but Deer Mama might be even better! The burger was so mouth-watering and I don't think I've ever had a better milkshake in my life. Everything ‚Ä¶"
111,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Creative, original ambiance, nice and varied menu centered around Beyond Meat creations; the burger with sweet potato fries which I tried came out quite good, had a proper texture as well as a nice flavor. At 23 EUR including Kombucha and tip a bit pricey, but not overly so."
112,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place, best vegan ice cream and mylk shakes! Good Gluten free options"
113,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food and cute atmosphere!
114,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is amazing. Food is delicious and decadent; the staff friendly, fast, and accommodating; and the atmosphere is fun in a retro-diner way. We had a booth facing the street so it was entertaining to watch the Amsterdammers walk, ‚Ä¶"

117,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We went back for a second time and this was a far better experience. We ordered the 'Jerusalem Artichoke Spread' and the 'Funky Rice Noodle'. Both were delicious and complimented each other very well. The flavors were rich and the colors on ‚Ä¶
118,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came and got milkshakes yesterday and we were so impressed! The milkshakes were so true to their flavour and the food on the menu looked amazing too. Such a cute restaurant and the man working was really lovely too :)
119,Deer Mama, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This review will probably be deleted, but this was absolutely the most disgusting food I've ever eaten. Had the 5 spices nuggets and the caramel, blueberry milkshake - and it almost made me throw up. ‚Ä¶"
120,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Oh my god, this place is amazing!
Everything is grate and Vegan!
The beyond meet burger is from the heaven üò±"
121,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing local! We started with milkshakes - definitely nothing for people on diet. The nachos and the burger were also delicious. Vegans and non-vegans have to eat there!
122,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I always wondered why should meat substitute burgers 'taste like meat' or be 'meat like' in their appearance - this was just an awesome meal, not thinking about how it looks or tastes compared to meat. Super tasty, filling, great service ‚Ä¶"
123,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food is so good it's ridiculous. The milkshakes are amazing and they have unusual yummy flavours. And everything is vegan. Also the staff is very friendly. Highly recommended!

126,Deer Mama, 1 star ,2 years ago,Went out of our way to visit this place because it looked promising. We ordered the galaxy pancakes and received these after waiting for 40-50 minutes (!). The pancakes were largely undercooked and lacked flavour. The waitress offered us ‚Ä¶
127,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,The crazy milkshakes are just brilliant. Just goes to show that as a vegan you don't have to miss out on anything as long as you get creative. If I could have without exploding I would have had two.
128,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,"ü¶å

Excellent service, clean as a whip and a menu that hits it out of the park. ‚Ä¶"
129,Deer Mama, 1 star ,2 years ago,By far the worst vegan restaurant we have been to in Amsterdam ! We have been there 3 times. The first time we went (april) we got two burgers. They arrived so fast. We were shocked. The burgers were so cold. We returned them back. We got ‚Ä¶

131,Deer Mama, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Food was great at always, but the staff was somewhat unorganized this day . They told us the restaurant was all booked but that we can have a table for an hour, which was fine, but then it took a while to take our order, and one of the ‚Ä¶"
132,Deer Mama, 1 star ,a year ago,"I always likes it here. But we ordered for 150 Euro's, all the bitterballs weer smashed, because it wasn't packed well. They didn't want to bring new portions. No help,. I Just had to call Thuisbezorgd. And if that didn't work out, I had to email them. This is not how you treat a cli√´nt."
133,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Oh my god, so good. Not a huge menu, but plenty of options still, mostly burgers and some oriental style dishes. Awesome milkshakes, too, and of course as the name implies it's all vegan. Bit pricy, though, so keep in mind, but well worth it."
134,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Really good food! I 100% recommend the ramen with bbq tempeh, super yummy üòç"
135,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had at Deer Mama's a chickpea burger and it tasted absolutely great. Also, I really liked the ginger beer selection they had. Unfortunately though, the atmosphere isn't the most pleasant. Typical Amsterdam style very noisy and crowded little restaurant."
136,Deer Mama, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I am a vegetarian and I had the chicken burger and this was horrible. The cheesy fries were okay but I have had better. Only good thing this place offers that I would recommend is their cakes and milkshakes. everything else, STAY AWAY!!"
137,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really lovely staff and great service! Delicious food- I‚Äôm not vegan and their burgers, milkshakes and nachos didn‚Äôt make me feel like I was missing out on anything- scrumptious! üéâ"
138,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An amazing place. A super cute interior, fun waitresses, tasty food and beautiful desserts, even with vegan soft serve ice cream! Had a blast with my friend (although ate way too much... worth it). Will definitely be visiting again."
139,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place with light decor and pleasant music playing in the background. Food was good, especially sweet potatoe fries and ginger tea. However, they could really improve on service!!!!!!! First, no acknowledgement when you walk in, no one ‚Ä¶"
140,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was the tastiest burger- I‚Äôve ever had. Absolutely amazing. I had the bbq beyond meat burger. Along with a cotton candy milkshake. This place is a must try.
Great service....."
141,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The burgers are amazing and you wouldn't even think the meat isn't real meat. Their pani puri starter was also delicious and flavourful. Milkshakes were also very nice although quite pricey.
142,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious burger, and the vegan cheese sauce was amazing.
Also, they lovingly catered for us even though it was close to closing.
I will be back there soon!"
143,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Super nice food, really kind staff. Got a lot of suggestions based on our preferences. Would totally order here again!"
144,Deer Mama, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was fine, but it sounded better on the menu, we ordered two different burgers but they tasted mostly the same, focusing more on the ""extras"" in the burger (sauces/vegetables) would improve it a lot."
145,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I really like Deer Mama! Went there twice, and both times I was very pleasantly surprised by the great vegan food. The tempea and the pulled jackfruit burgers are so worth coming back for! Also the starters and deserts are delicious. If you crave tasty vegan food, go to Deer Mama!"
146,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It is so tastes like meat that I experienced confused feelings as a vegetarian
147,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Delicious vegan burger and nice waitress !
148,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We both had the Vegan breakfast and I pimped mine up with sausage - after eating we didnt need to eat until Dinner!! Scrambled Tofu was unusual and loved the black beans.

152,Deer Mama, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Pros: friendly staff and good coffee. Cons: the food, we had burgers which were tasty but way too heavy and greasy. The fries appeared to have been fried twice. Afterwards my friend and I both felt very nauseous.
Not coming back, sorry guys."

157,Deer Mama, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very bad service when ordering a cake to take home. They said that they didn‚Äôt have enough time to make a cake for my sons birthday when they had a week to do it.  They called me only two hours in advance and missed the call, so I ended up trying to find a cake for my son on the day of his birthday."
158,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"When you stroll around in the neighbourhood you must drop by this place!
My daughers and I had lunch and later on we went back to have some dinner!
They do soft-serve, mylkshakes (with booze also), cakes, burgers and other vegan ‚Ä¶"
159,Deer Mama, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food was actually pretty damn good. The snarky service was terrible. Late, sarcastic, patronising and just straight up rude. Paying top prices for small portions is okay if the flavour is there (it is), getting snapped when asking basic questions isn‚Äôt. 1/5 would not recommend."
160,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Incredible vegan food selection. The sweet potato fries are to die for and having a great root beer float put it over the top. Will definitely be going back.
161,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is the best vegan burger bar! Not only do they have burgers they also have amazing desserts. I've been fantasizing about the food there since I ate there.

163,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The fancy pancake stack was very filling and delicious, i would like abit more maple sirup on it but the banana, blueberry and pecan tied it together brilliant. ‚Ä¶"
164,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"You could 'just' go for the delicious Pani Puri, but then you would miss out on their great burgers (loved the tempeh-burger!), sandwiches (Jerusalem artichoke spread, yum!) and cakes & cookies. ‚Ä¶"

166,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had the chocolate dip cookie dough milkshake and the nacho burger with the beyond burger on in and is was the best food i have ever had. 15/10 vegan junk food bar eat your heart out.
167,Deer Mama, 5 stars ,a year ago,5 Spice Banh Mi is super tasty and I wouldn't have tasted that it wasn't real duck even if the vegan chef would have slapped me in the face with a block of tofu.
168,Deer Mama, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Really bad sercice. They forgot to put in our order and we were waiting, waiting and waiting... the waiter(s) were snarky and impolite. If you are into 'instagrammable' junk food, this is your place. If you're looking for plantbased whole and healthy foods in a nice atmosphere, please steer away from this place."
169,Deer Mama, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It‚Äôs a nice place for vegan food. Food was nice but not the best.
