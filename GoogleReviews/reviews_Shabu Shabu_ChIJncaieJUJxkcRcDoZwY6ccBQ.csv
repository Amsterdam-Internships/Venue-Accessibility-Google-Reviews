0,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The concept of ""all you can eat"" is just awesome. You pay 27‚Ç¨ and eat non stop for 2 hours. Food was also awesome. Fresh and tasty. Your orders are delivered very fast. ‚Ä¶"
1,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The service is good, the location and the restaurant is ok, so big and spacious, not busy for weekdays and all you can eat is not bad.. They offer this buffet for dessert and not bad at all even the brownies"
2,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food is delicious!! The staff were really nice and even took pictures of us. They were also kind enough to let us switch to another table.The only downside is that the drinks were on the expensive side (But also really delicious to be ‚Ä¶
3,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We were a bit sceptical because some of the reviews were not the best, but we tried. And we were so positively surprised. Extremely nice staff and actually very good sushi. The service is also very fast. Definitely recommend!"
4,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"If you are hungry, then yes. We really enjoyed our time from this restaurant on the other location so we wanted to try here too. Since we were so hungry and we usually eat a lot so this kind of restaurant was good choice for us to afford ‚Ä¶"
5,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very tasty food. We were there on Christmas Day and it was a little pricy (38 euro/person). The staff is really helpful and friendly. Definitely recommend going there.
6,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is very good option if you are hungry but you want light food to enjoy in it.
Cozy and comfy place, very good service, kind staff. ‚Ä¶"
7,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty food , really nice sushi , I always go to this sushi caffe in Amsterdam. I give 4 stars , because deserts are not tasty. They charge a lot of money, for desert they could put normal cakes."
8,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice location and the place is nicely decorated. Service is kinda slow and sometimes you get a waiter giving you the food with little care. ‚Ä¶
9,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,2 years ago,Attended here very recently and from the outside and decent lengthly fresh menu I thought I would be in for a delicious meal. ‚Ä¶

12,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We enjoyed our food very much.  The staff were very friendly and helpful :-)
13,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice sushi, the best nigiris I‚Äôve ever tasted! Friendly staff, beautiful place... definitely a good place if you love sushi.
The best you can do is order a mix menu, otherwise your sushi will cost you a lot of money."
14,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing restaurant, nice people and the best sushi ever!!"
15,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quick to be seated and served. Food tastes amazing, drinks were a little pricy however. Place was clean, and quiet enough to relax after a long day of sightseeing"
16,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,So many small dishes to choose from. Not that quality food one expects. I like the deep fried buffalo wings though.
17,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food and super quick service! Lots of different options on the menu, and you can either get individual rolls or pick one of the sets."
18,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My favorite restaurant in the city! You can order using a tablet! The taste is amazing and the dessert buffet is awesome!

21,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It has a great variety of dishes to choose from, and is all you can eat. The food sometimes tastes great, sometimes meh but never bad. The bad part is that service (apart from bringing the food) seems to be very consistently slow. This ‚Ä¶"
22,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We got in around 8:30pm, there was a lot of people there but we got a table pretty fast. You get a small tablet where you can order as much as you want for 2 hours, drinks not included. ‚Ä¶"
23,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is amazing, the staff is very friendly and I like the concept of ordering your food and beverages on a tablet."
24,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,All you can eat sushi for ‚Ç¨30 pp for two hours of non stop eating. Every ten minutes each person can order 4 small food portions using a tablet. ‚Ä¶
25,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very tasty food if you are into Sushi. Service kind of ok but very robotic.

31,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Had a lunch here, went with the sushi, it was prepared correctly and the food was tasty.  I cannot fault them."
32,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quite good food for an AYCE, drinks are on the expensive side. You can order from a tablet which makes it quite efficient."

34,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Two of us dined for an all-you-can-eat lunch - reasonably priced at ‚Ç¨18.50 per person. Good range of fish, chicken, veg plates etc and an easy-to-use tablet system allows you to order four plates per person every ten minutes. You're ‚Ä¶"
35,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had a company outing and we chose the all you can eat menu. You order in rounds, about five items per person, then you can order after 7-10minutes. ‚Ä¶"

37,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very expensive menu. Option are what you would expect in a all you can eat sushi place. Not that many sushi options though. Ordering was very smooth through tablets and the food came to the table super fast! Some dishes were great, some ‚Ä¶"
38,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The website is not clear about lunch and dinner. They have a different menu for lunch, which wasn't a great menu. If I had known from the site that this would be the lunch menu, I would have gone to a different restaurant. Price on the ‚Ä¶"

40,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Having been to Shabu Shabu for several years now, I've experienced the worst and the best of the place. It's the classic ""all you can eat"" system, where you can order an unlimited amount of dishes in a certain time-frame for a set price, ‚Ä¶"
41,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food is not good at all!!! The sushi had this nasty fish taste that‚Äôs been sitting around for ages! The meat wasn‚Äôt  good either. The noodles had a burnt taste to them and were super dry!! In summary, we paid a very expensive bill for less than average food. Very disappointed."
42,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious didn't begin to cover it! Selection is amazing and you are not rushed at all!
43,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,2 years ago,"It was horrible!!!! The waitresses just torture us with their unprofessionality. They seems unhappy about their work. They threw  food on us without apology and thanks god it wasn't soup.  They said nothing about the food, no explanation. ‚Ä¶"
44,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, with very kind and good service. The staff is very friendly and helpfull. For a good price you can eat for 2 hours,  and the food is so tasty. Everything arrived in time to the table. And one of the best part... the dessert bar also included."
45,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This was our first trip to this chain, interesting concept on food ordering and delivery.  Gluten  free selection was good.  Even our picky eater was happy.  Food was good also, all you can eat.  Also all you can drink...but not on the weekend."
46,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cheap all you can eat lunch 17‚Ç¨ pp. Nice tablet to order food. Really spacious and brilliant theme. One of the waitress was awesome the other awful (no smile, arguing over pushing the wrong button on tablet...) Would recommend though. Food was good!"
47,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good all you-can-eat restaurant with a good seafood/sushi menu.
You order by a tablet as much as you want for 2 hours
Price/quality is good for a restaurant in the center of Amsterdam ‚Ä¶"
48,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic value. Not your bog standard all-you-can eat buffet, but table service. The all-you-can eat menu is a sushi menu so you need to like sushi! For two hours you can order 6 items each every 8 minutes for around  ‚Ç¨28 each. An item ‚Ä¶"
49,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good restaurant to have some sushi. Has a weird thing of waiting for 10 minutes between orders and also a maximum of 4 dishes per person. Not that normal on restaurants alike, but well, you'll still be full when you leave. There is ‚Ä¶"

52,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, a lot of choices. Korean dishes are fun to try this way (all you can eat), but I love sushi more!
Overall nothing bad to say about this restaurant."

55,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is awesome. You get a tablet at your table with probably 100+ options. You choose up to eight items on the tablet and the servers bring you the food 5 to 10 minutes later. And it's all you can eat.
56,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Such great sushi for an all you can eat place. The staff is usually attentive and I like ordering on the tablets. Try the karage!
57,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful restaurant, very friendly and helpful staff and an almost staggering amount of things on the menu. Pricing isn't very expensive either (I'm a student and even I could afford to eat here.) all in all, a wonderful restaurant you should definitely give a try, make sure you book a reservation in advance though."

60,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Not as good as it used to be. This restaurant, for me, was known for serving food of really good quality, and decent portioning, for a fair proce. Currently the prices have gone up, the portions have gotten smaller and the quality has gone ‚Ä¶"
61,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Interesting all you can eat close to the Rembrandtplein, the portions of small dishes like kare and noodles work well with the turn based all you can eat concept, the rolls are interesting and the ambiance is casual. The service is very ‚Ä¶"
62,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing all you can eat Japanese restaurant. Depending on the day you pay 26-29‚Ç¨ per person and can order food every 8 minutes. Each round of food is ordered on a tablet left at your table. Great friendly service and quality food.
63,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"As much as I am usually skeptical about unlimited sushi, this restaurant was phenomenal. The sushi was of proficient quality, the meat was excellent and considering I ate a lot, 29‚Ç¨ was well worth it. I would definitely reccommend this restaurant if you want something which specializes in both quality and quantity"
64,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the all-you-can-eat lunch menu. It was ok for the price: big quantity but medium-low quality. The makis and uramakis were tasteless and the texture was not great. The salmon niguiris used the wrong parts of the fish, some were tough to chew."
65,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I have been here many times before but it has been decreasing in quality, as the price increases. We got drinks with our glasses filled by 80%(40% of that was ice), every round we either, didnt got what we ordered or the waitress brought ‚Ä¶"
66,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,2 years ago,not really all you can eat..  you can only order 4 pieces of sushi per person every 10 min and have a seating limit of 2 hours.... imaging going to a restaurant starving and waiting for 4 small pieces of sushi every 10 min. ‚Ä¶
67,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Avoid this place, especially if you have food allergies. All the rolls have cream cheese in them, despite no mention of cheese on the menu (rolls that are only supposed to have a single type of filling, etc). When we asked the waiter about ‚Ä¶"

69,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great service! Very fast, and very friendly. When you get seated, you'll be given a tablet from which you can make orders very quickly. Soon after you order, you'll get the food. The service is very snappy. The only exception in my case was ‚Ä¶"
70,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We can choose many food. That's why i many visited shabushabu. Not that great but many kind of food and reasonable food taste is i like here. Reall Japanese good sushi here can't find difficult. That's why i like here. Just normal and many choose food.
71,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"WOW, WOW, WOW!!! Absolutely AMAZING!!! All you can eat where it is freshly made as you choose what you want from the menu!!! You get to choose 5 dishes from the menu every 8 minutes for a duration of 2 hours!!! There is a great selection ‚Ä¶"
72,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice large place where you can sit without elbowing your neighbours while eating like in most other all you can eat sushi restaurants.
We had a very nice table with a view on the street and all the room around us we needed.  The food was good and service fast and friendly"
73,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,In the average for a Asian all you can eat in Amsterdam. I like they have iPad and not paper menu. However the quality of the food isn‚Äôt great and price are a bit too high. Service is great and stuff is super helpful. Avoid fried dishes as you may digest them in a month or two
74,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"You order from a tablet which is great as you don't need to wait on the server. Once the server comes is when the problems come. Very ""robotic"" service. Not friendly or memorable at all. ‚Ä¶"
75,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"They serve frozen food here. That should tell you about their quality. The drinks are not inclusive, ridiculously expensive and they don't offer free tap water, which in my opinion every good restaurant should. I mean you could easily just ‚Ä¶"
76,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Rude staff. Small portions. Good food but expensive for the amount that you get, unless you can eat 10+ things in 2 hours. Water is extremely expensive because they don't have tap water. I got yelled at when I reached for my water bottle ‚Ä¶"
77,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, a lot of choices. Korean dishes are fun to try this way (all you can eat), but I love sushi more!
Overall nothing bad to say about this restaurant."
78,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,2 years ago,Prices are high for what they serve to you.  The udon noodles I asked for were heated in the microwave and when I asked to change them they wanted to charge me more.  3 pieces of sushi for 4-6 euro is extremely expensive. Don't recomend this place.
79,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"This an all you can eat joint, but there are rules and you have to pay attention really close to them. There is a tablet to make your order, 4 dishes every 10 minutes per diner. One tablet serves 5 people, so thatst 20 dishes per order. ‚Ä¶"
80,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We were recommended this all you can eat buffet during our stay in Amsterdam, so we decided to go to Shabu Shabu at lunch because it's 18‚Ç¨50 per person while it's 27‚Ç¨50 during dinner I believe. We could not be seated where we wanted to sit, ‚Ä¶"
81,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The sushi is fine and they also have nice cocktails. However, it is quite expensive for a simple, not very high end, all you can eat sushi restaurant. Also there is no option for all you can drink, which is a shame since the drinks are very expensive."
82,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This restaurant doesn‚Äôt even deserve a star. First of all the food was good, but I saw a rat running across the stairs while i was walking to my seat and i think 2 people of the staff had seen it too because they were terrified. I‚Äôve never ‚Ä¶"
83,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,16 vegean dishes. Excellent service. Very fast order. 18.50 eur per person for lunch. You have 2 hours to order. Ordering rounds are 4 dishes per person every 8 minutes. Very tasty food. I was stuffed at the end of my lunch.
84,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"At lunch 18 euro for all you can eat, good quality for the cheap price. Is it The best japanese food ever? No, but once again, definitely worth the price. Service was super fast"
85,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,There is nothing Shabu Shabu about this place. No Japanese hot pot whatsoever. And the all you can eat claim is inaccurate. Can't be all you can eat if they impose an eight item limit every ten minutes. And a single Nigri is 'an item'. ‚Ä¶
86,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"There are certain rules you need to abide to, and we were hesitant initially, but the sushis came really fast, in a timely manner, and they were very tasty as well! Hope to come here again one day!"
87,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great all you can eat sushi place! Awesome menu and good price for what you get. Also lots and lots of dessert at the end! Yummy üòã
88,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Top class of sushi ""all you can eat"" mode. You can order your dishes by yourself with a tablet. The service it's very fast and accurate. Nice place in Amsterdam."
89,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very reasonable and affordable all you can eat Sushi and Asian food served to your table. Quality and taste was well above for this class of all you can eat restaurant. Recommended especially if you are into a Sushi and Sashimi...
90,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I've been to many similar order-by-tablet-ayce places. 4 Nigiri every ten minutes was lowest ratio I've seen so far. Taste is okay for an ayce place.
91,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Its a busy place,  but i just love the food and the ambiance here!  I really enjoy eating there.  Sometimes food might take a while to get to your table but when i look around at the space they serve im amazed!  It's huge!!  Also i noticed they added some new things to the menu,  always a good thing!"
92,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Have had dinner at this restaurant, though there‚Äôs nothing particulary wrong at this restaurant; the staff is friendly, the location is perfect, the design nice and the food ofcourse is fine as well. ‚Ä¶"
93,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Brilliant service and awesome dishes. Plenty of choice and all really good choices. Worth every penny (euro). Will definitely be going again!
94,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I have been here several times. Price is a bit high. Was like 36 Euro per person with the drinks. Can't expect the food quality to be very high. Service is so so. In general, I want to try to go to all you can eat places as less as possible."
95,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Usually I am not so picky with sushi. But this was really bad, I did not had high expectations. And the service was slow, table cleaning was not on point and waited for the first drink for at least 30 minutes. Would consider a Shabu Shabu in the Hague but this one at Rembrandt is very bad. Sorry"
96,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great concept of ordering food with tablet. Delicious food. Friendly staff. If you want to try different Japanese dishes with reasonable price, this is the good choice."
97,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"This place is ok, neither better nor worse than ok. It is Japenese food reduced to the most acceptable and bland state. In particular, the miso soup was quite nice, but the sushi and the sashimi were practically without any taste. Perhaps ‚Ä¶"
98,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is tasty, but do not go here on the weekend. It is crazy busy and the service is slowed down to a crawl. We had to wait a long time between dishes and all the warm ones arrived almost cold."
99,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was delicious. Every flavour was distinct. Service was pretty darn fast, but didn't get any ginger. Overall, worth 5 stars"
100,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Location is great, food is fine for the AYCE concept. However, organisation is terrible. When it is busy or under staffed you will never get your full order fulfilled. And it takes a long take after ordering to get to your table. Which is ‚Ä¶"
101,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice idea that you can order via tablet. It makes the whole experience very impersonal, however. It's an all you can eat fast food place, if you don't expect anything else, you should be fine."
102,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The worst sushi ever. I think very bad quality, bad service and staff was extremely unkind. They didn't welcome us in a kind way, they forced us to order very quickly and the service was extremely slow. The price was also high and not well related to the quality of food."
103,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Super expensive for the quality and really restrictive compared to other ""all you can eat"" sushi restaurants. My experience was capped off with seeing a very confident mouse strolling around right next to my table. The staff informed me ‚Ä¶"
104,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"""All you can eat"" restaurant which gives you 2 hours to order what you want.
The service is quick and the dishes are ordered through tablets.
There's a good choice a different meals."
105,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,All you can eat sushi and Japanese food. You order 4 items of the menu every 10 minutes. All automated service through an iPad. Very fast service with good food for about ‚Ç¨25.
106,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Yea it's all you can eat for I think 2 hours? Maybe one and a half. The ordering is all done through the tablet at your table. The reason a star is off is because a fair number of their dishes are not correct e.g their katsu curry is labelled as tori Kari age but that's fairly minor
107,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,From speed of service to family friendliness which is hard to find in sushi places in Amsterdam Shabu Shabu excels. The quality and consistency of the food is fine but we go back because of the family friendly service.
108,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Lunch 17,80 euro.  Fish quality decent.  Too much rice, also was machine formed not by hand.  Service also ok, unpretentious unlike places where you're asked 10 times if everything is ok.  BIG COMPLAINT is I already read review saying tap ‚Ä¶"
109,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very overpriced, food is decent but im sure you can find equally decent food somewhere better and cheaper. Drinks aren‚Äôt included, you cant even get tapwater, we had problems with the tablet they give you to order from as soon as we got it, ‚Ä¶"
110,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"It was mandatory to order a drink. Normally that would not be a problem however we had to order it before we could start our meal. Besides that the food smelled strange, but tasted okay. It was an awkward experience, won't be coming back here."
111,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It was okay, if you want an all you can sushi, there are better ones in Amsterdam.
It was a nice place to sit and had good service but the sushi itself wasnt mind blowing, it was, mediocre. Nothing I'd recommend anybody."
112,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Very good sushi for a reasonable price. Sadly enough mice were walking all over the floor of the restaurant so we had to leave earlier.
113,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good food. Great service and great atmosphere!
114,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Such great sushi for an all you can eat place. The staff is usually attentive and I like ordering on the tablets. Try the karage!
115,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"It's called Shabu Shabu but they don't serve shabu shabu style food - just so you know. It's an ""all"" you can eat sushi place (for lunch we could order up to five rounds of five dishes per person per round -- we only made it to round 3 before we were full). The food was good and service fast."
116,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"One of my favorite AYCE sushi restaurants in Amsterdam. Delicious sushi, fair prices, and lightning fast service. Especially high coolness factor due to the tablets they use, love it!"
117,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The good was really amazing. Really Nice restaurant but The service was awfull, we waited an hour to only get something we didn't even order. Total wait one hour and a half. Would not recommend!"
118,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Ate here last week. Dirty tables and the staff was very inhospitable. Also, the portions are a lot smaller then it used to be. Bathrooms very dirty as well. Never going back to this establishment."
119,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Very good food with a reasonable price! The restaurant is huge probaly the biggest I ever seen, so I don't think there is any chance that you don't find a place, and they are a lot of different sushis. I would definitely go there again"
120,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I tried once...but definitely I will come back ... I love the foods the presentation itself was so amazing... the taste of foods was so delicious I love it very well.. ‚Ä¶
121,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, fast service and quality was more than fine. Not tolhe most romantic place for a diner but overall more than fine. And lots of dishes!"
122,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"We were a group of six, among which two only were having the all-you-can-eat menu. They moved us around multiple times and eventually split up because they didn't believe that the other four people wouldn't exchange food with the only two that were having the all-you-can-eat."
123,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Not a great value for money. The menu consists of frozen and badly fried stuff
There are a lot nicer places to eat and enjoy your food"
124,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,3 years ago,You can order 4 items per person in 10 minutes. In half an hour you can get 12 nigiris at most. Great!
125,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"It is what you can expect: decent food in large quantities. However, the variety of sushi and ramen is not very wide, but I enjoyed both times I have been here."
126,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best place to spend your evening with your wife or family.

Very modern and good speed of service. ‚Ä¶"
127,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good food and fast service. Few orders were missed though and caused long wait. A little confusing system if you opt for Ala Carte.
128,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lunch menu is the best value for money. Dinner menu pricy. Very central and plenty of space, very good to get together with friends."
129,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is tasty, we choose 'eat everything', which means no limitations at all except that it has be to finished in two hours, besides there will be penalties if ordered dishes are not finished, which is a good way to reduce waste, so be aware of that, and there are fruits and ice creams, free to choose"
130,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great sushi and other Japanese style foods on the all you can eat menu. The staff is hard working and friendly.
131,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I love the idea of getting a tablet programmed to take your order and the waiting staff are there to help out and bring the goods. The practise works well too. Quite upset there isn't a similar establishment in the uk
132,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, only one dish (Ebi Tempura) tasted like cardboard.  The staff is a bit rude, but that's probably because there are a ton of tourists in the area."
133,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fast and friendly service. Insanely fast and friendly service. Insanely large variety of food. Such a cool Concept in restaurants and reasonably priced for all you can eat sushi
134,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best sushi in town. Fresh and beautifull.
135,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Service was poor: dishes we ordered not delivered, and grumpy response when we asked about it. At the final checkout there were drinks included that we had not received. Food was okay but not great."
136,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A good place to eat, not the best quality sushi but it's great and inexpensive. The miso soup, tonkatsu & gyoza are also worth trying."
137,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very fine all-you-can-eat sushi and asian fusion restaurant. Good atmosphere, nice staff, great service. Recommended"
138,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was ok, nothing overly fresh or exciting. The novelty of ordering on an iPad wears off quickly. It felt like eating in a posh McDonald's"
139,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,It's ok. Can be expensive depending on your selection and eating habits. Also they force you to buy a drink. Not sure what happens if you refuse...
140,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beste Shushi I have ever eaten and the ""All you can eat"" is very cheap f√ºr 18,50‚Ç¨ pp. Very nice- ich rate this 5/5 without thinking one moment"
141,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Avoid this place. The food is tasteless. The service is horrible. Even when the place is completely empty, you will still have to wait about 1 hour on your food. Often this place is empty, so expect they will close if they don't improve soon."
142,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Food in comparison with other shabushabu restaurants very poor. Service was quick but not very friendly, we got moved to 4 different tables. I would not come here again."
143,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,5 years ago,All you can eat sushi! Definitely one of the better ones. Friendly stuff. A modern take for their ordering system through tablets on each table!
144,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,4 years ago,They choose to accept us (6 people) when it was already late and they put us an incredible rush beause the staff wanted to go home! (The manager was even saying that they don‚Äôt pay extra hours üòÇ) Never happend this in a restaurant! What a rats!!!!!
145,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Got before 4pm for the best deal. Amazing get service and decent price
146,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good system. You order 4 dishes every 10 mins. I was fine after 3 rounds.
147,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was good, service was fast. Staff did not want to serve us tap water, instead pushing 6 euro bottles of water. It was for meds..."
148,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Food was amazing and a reasonable price for all you can eat. However they were understaffed and it was very noticeable in quality of service.
149,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff was not to friendly or interested, also the sushi wasn't tasty..  I would recommend to walk a bit further to KU in the utrechtse straat, that's what I call sushi!"
150,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good deal for a good sushi quality but didn't like staff attitude, as we reach before half an hour of the closing time and we didn't receive any service we had to stand and bring our own dishes as well soya"
151,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice location with mediocre food WOULD NOT recommend.

Should have checked reviews before sitting down but I was hungry and it looked like a good idea."
152,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, extravagant sushi and hot dishes selection, Special drinking choices (japanese Beer Iki and japanese Soda brand Calpis). Service was a bit inattentive..."
153,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good quality ""all u can eat"" and very tasty. BUT they charge extra for everything (sweet sauce, sashimi,etc..) and its already expensive as it is."
154,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,All you can eat structure is pretty good and the food was great. Staff was very friendly and the location is top notch with good views of Rembrandtplein.
155,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food, super tastey drinks we need one in the UK! Good value for money, especially at lunchtime! <3"
156,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,5 years ago,All you can eat buffet with quality
157,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Quite good sushi all you can eat, with especially a good sushi part and less interesting warm dishes part. Good location and nice area!"
158,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food! Awesome service and reasonable priced, especially for the quality you are getting! Can recommend for all!"
159,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Waited ages for the food. We ordered from the menu (no all you can eat) and got ignored for  an hour. After complain food was brought to us after seconds.
160,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is great, service can be lacking sometimes but overall I would definitely recommend it if you are a fan of all you can eat sushi"
161,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,3 years ago,No information given about the allergens in the food. Very complicated for a gluten intolerant. Waiters were quite unpleasant.
162,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great all you can eat menu for a budget. Not fancy or highest of quality but price/performance is top notch
163,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, a little crowded sometimes but other than that it's a great place to fill the sushi craving haha"
164,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The food is ok. Don't expect to be amazed. We were there for Saturday lunch and service was good and fast.
165,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,If you think this is actual shabu shabu turn around !! There isn't a hot pot within Kms of this joint. The food isn't bad but not something you necessary want to seek out. :/ üôÑ
166,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The sushi here is great. A few exceptions included in the buffet were the miso soup and the ice cream that were both mediocre.
167,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great sushi food for a reasonable price. Lots of seating possible and spatious table layout.
168,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Terrible and super slow service!!!
Guys...trust me you dont want to waste your well earned money of 30euro to this place @ Shabu Shabu Rembrandtplein.You just only walk out with frustration.
The only plus for this restaurant is the centralized location."
169,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I asked for a glass of tap water and they refused to give it to me. Saying that it is not possible. Food was decent, service decent."
170,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good sushi, all you can eat for a good price. I also enjoyed the miso soup and ramen in particular."
171,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was great, but she told us we had 2 hours, and after an hour she took away the tablet we ordered food on."
172,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Quite basic menu with nice decorations but you can‚Äôt choose your seat anyway. Funny that it‚Äôs called shabushabu but they don‚Äôt provide shabushabu...
173,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,2 years ago,Mice running through the restaurant. And the owner didnt care. He said post the review on Facebook and Google maps. Guess the money was more important than the service. üôÑ
174,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The table, menu, soy bottle and tablet everything was sticky (before we started with dinner). Please clean you're tables. Food was OK."
175,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Just what you expect from an all-you-can-eat sushi place. ""OK"" food but nothing noteworthy, same can be had anywhere in town"
176,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious food! Chicken was tasty and crunchy, so was vegetables. Awesome and kind service. Worth visiting!"
177,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"all you can eat a la card -when dreams come true :) although the quality is ok-ish, still worth going there."
178,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely restaurant, great food ... until a mouse came right under our table and well.. that was the end of our dinner..."
179,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great for and service. Make sure to order what you want to eat only! Very handy to order with a tablet
180,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was good, i just wish there were more vegan options"
181,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Ordering using a tablet at your table. The taste is great. Would recommend.

185,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Nice sushi place. Has an open and spacious setting. All you can eat sushi and desert.
186,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Bad quality sushi .. Sure it's all you can eat but why would you eat here

Just do yourself a favour and skip this one"
187,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Rude service, will not serve tap water even if you have a large food and drink bill. Food is okay but expensive."
188,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"very nice food, but they should put people with children in a separate corner. crying babies ruin my appetite"
189,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Sat down and ordered water. Water here is ‚Ç¨6,45. This restaurant is not Shabu Shabu either. It's all just sushi."
190,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Took the open sushi offer, nice, clean, calm, good staff, delicious food, the deserts are better than the sushi :)."
191,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"For all you can eat, Taste and choice better than sumo. Well of course expensive."
192,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great ALL you can eat place! Special niguirisushis, unagui, salmon gunkan and octupus. Loved It!!"
193,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Too bad. Poor service, bad food. A system that has tried to be modern but is pure control. Exaggerated prices. Never again."
194,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good all u can eat sushi , not the best , bit commercial but for what you pay for its a good deal"
195,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, good portions in the all you can eat and an unlimited desert bar."
196,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Still nice food but they really need to upgrade the dessert station.
197,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Plain horrible. Horrible slow service, horrible food, ultra busy. They closed the one in Heineken Plein which was quite decent. This is a one mistake and never again ever."
198,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Expensive but very nice food. You order on a tablet and they bring you your food, very modern."
199,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food.
Tablet menu.
I've cream (but it's so cold it's barely possible to get some)"
200,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,2 years ago,not really all you can eat..  you can only order 4 pieces of sushi per person every 10 min and have a seating limit of 2 hours.... imaging going to a restaurant starving and waiting for 4 small pieces of sushi every 10 min. ‚Ä¶
201,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was great, but she told us we had 2 hours, and after an hour she took away the tablet we ordered food on."
202,Shabu Shabu, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"They serve frozen food here. That should tell you about their quality. The drinks are not inclusive, ridiculously expensive and they don't offer free tap water, which in my opinion every good restaurant should. I mean you could easily just ‚Ä¶"
203,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, good portions in the all you can eat and an unlimited desert bar."
204,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Terrible and super slow service!!!

The only plus for this restaurant is the centralized location."
205,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"It's called Shabu Shabu but they don't serve shabu shabu style food - just so you know. It's an ""all"" you can eat sushi place (for lunch we could order up to five rounds of five dishes per person per round -- we only made it to round 3 before we were full). The food was good and service fast."
206,Shabu Shabu, 1 star ,2 years ago,Prices are high for what they serve to you.  The udon noodles I asked for were heated in the microwave and when I asked to change them they wanted to charge me more.  3 pieces of sushi for 4-6 euro is extremely expensive. Don't recomend this place.
207,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Fast service and nice decor. Huge place but the food wasn't that great and a bit pricy
208,Shabu Shabu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good vibe, amazing food and friendly staff!!"

214,Shabu Shabu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great food and great service. The lunch price is also very accessible!
215,Shabu Shabu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,10 minute gap between orders doesn't  work well if you are eating alone and dont want to hang around.
