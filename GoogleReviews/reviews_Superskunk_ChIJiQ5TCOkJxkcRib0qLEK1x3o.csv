7,Superskunk, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Really chilled coffee shop with decent vibe. Prices for weed are lower than most coffee shops closer to city center. Music is suspect, mainly old charts, saw some patrons being forced to purchase a drink even though they bought weed.  Bald ‚Ä¶"

13,Superskunk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic selection of weed but due to its name it attracts an awful lot of the TOURIST  trade. This isn't personally my choice of Coffeeshop as I have visited Amsterdam on over 30 occasions. I have Dutch friends who wouldn't go near this ‚Ä¶
14,Superskunk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I love this place and have visited on both occasions I've gone to Amsterdam. I would love to give this place a 5 star but the drinks are super expensive and you have to purchase them to sit in and smoke. The music is typically great but can ‚Ä¶

19,Superskunk, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice staff, nice weed 10/10 !!!"
20,Superskunk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of my favorite coffee shop. Had many nice memories there. High chairs seating area at the front under gorgeous oriental lights. And comfy chilled out sofa seating area at the back with dim lighting. ‚Ä¶
21,Superskunk, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Super chill, professional and clean. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Great decor, feels more like a social sit down rather than a quick smoke-n-go.

24,Superskunk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place has a wonderful back area with spacious comfortable seating and lighting, relaxed but not cliche music, and refreshing foods and drinks. Being a bit off the beaten path, it has a much smaller crowd that tends not to be as touristy. Highly recommend!"
25,Superskunk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent place to chill. We order 0.5 gram wax and it‚Äôs amazing. Music is good as well. I like our last night experience in Amsterdam.

Good coffee as well just don't buy water!"
30,Superskunk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Really great music and overall a good vibe to the place. The servers can be pretty rough around the edges though. Even if you are with a friend just buying something and leaving you must buy something to be in the store which was a little annoying. Otherwise a good place.
31,Superskunk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Listen... get The Light Muffin. I don't care how experienced you think you are, start with The Light Muffins. It's GOOD, and the chocolate chip chunks are delicious. But seriously, start there... on an empty stomach... just eat the top... and give it some time. Just... yeah."
32,Superskunk, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"First time in this coffee shop, perfect vibes, music, perfect customer service and simple menu. Comfy sofas and nice beverages. Best brownies 0.8g ate around 80 euros worth in a few days."

34,Superskunk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"You HAVE to buy a drink in there. They rush you and make you feel unwelcome and like youre having to spend a lot of money before youve even step inside. Really bad customer service and lack of good welcoming communication. Its a shame, as inside is alright."
35,Superskunk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing relaxing chilled out atmosphere. Highly recommend not a tourist trap but a place to chill like a local and that‚Äôs me saying a non native from London Town. ‚Ä¶
36,Superskunk, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great place, very friendly staff cheap drinks weed is a bit more expensive but I'll take the friendly service any day of the week!!!

45,Superskunk, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Very friendly staff. Lower than average prices. Apple skunk may be the tastiest to be had in the city.  House glass, grinders and other accoutrements for use. Can't moor table couch and cushion lounge. Music is usually an electric mix of covers and originals.  Not the best name, but certainly top five CS in amsterdam."
46,Superskunk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little place just like most other coffeshops. The budtender was really nice in telling us different information about their products, so that we could choose knowingly :)"
