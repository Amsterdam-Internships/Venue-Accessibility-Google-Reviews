0,Tanuki, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Tanuki is a great place to go for some Japanese food. The delivery was fast and the waiters were polite. The price is appropriate for what you get. We visited during the Coronavirus restrictions, so the restaurant stops orders at 4:15pm"
1,Tanuki, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"To be fair - as a restaurant situated practically inside a shopping mall, I was expecting the food to be 'just good'. Turns out, it's better than good - it's excellent. …"
2,Tanuki, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Only tried out one dish for lunch the Daigoro steak. But it was soo good! Very affordable and the staff was super friendly.
3,Tanuki, 2 stars ,9 months ago,Went here with my colleagues yesterday. I had the Fried Udon Noodles and topped it up with Ebi Tempura. It was disappointing because the portion was too small and the Prawn tempuras just look unappetising. Food is just mediocre. Paying EUR12.80 for that dish is just not worth the price.
4,Tanuki, 4 stars ,4 months ago,The quality of food has decreased a bit. The staff have always been polite to me. I visited this restaurant with my friend and she has a little girl. They were more than helpful to seat us as comfortably as possible.
5,Tanuki, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Had the lunch wafu steak menu, grilled mackerel and the unagi nigiri. Steak was ok, nice bite (although not very tender) but a bit light on the flavors. Mackerel was nice but was expecting it to be a bit more fatty. Unagi was good size and tastes as you would expect. If I would eat here again I would probably go for a sushi set"
6,Tanuki, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"The food is not really authentic Japanese food. Only the name sounds like Japanese but in fact it's a Chinese company who make some Japanese food to sell. While the yakitori should grill on the charcoal fire, they basically just warm it up …"
7,Tanuki, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Always delicious! Treated myself a Japanese lunch. Once you're there you want to try everything on the menu. Unfortunately at some point your stomach is screaming: stop it is to much now...hahaha. So, till next time.:-D"
8,Tanuki, 1 star ,2 years ago,"An awful experience. the staff was incredibly unpleasant. I ordered sushi with only salmon and asked clearly if it was just salmon in one of the dishes because I am allergic to shellfish. the waitress answered ""yes"" its only salmon, when I …"
9,Tanuki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good Japanese Restaurant. The food is great and the quality is very good. The service is very friendly as well. I'm at least once a month there. My friends love this place as well.
10,Tanuki, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Affordable, high quality Japanese food. Drinks are also nice. The service can be improved but is friendly."
11,Tanuki, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"It's amazing. Such a good Asian restaurant.
The food comes pretty quick.
I went there so many times and never was disappointed. …"
12,Tanuki, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Lovely food. Beautiful ambience. Friendly staff.
13,Tanuki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, beautifully decorated place, and friendly personnel. It is usually busy and fully packed, so make sure to have a reservation, especially in the evenings."
14,Tanuki, 3 stars ,7 months ago,OK Japanese food in a trendy setting. Nothing special.
15,Tanuki, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Really good Japanese restaurant, my first in the Netherlands. They have quite a good selection of small snacks as it would be in a Japanese bar, and tasted quite authentic. Nice ambience and good service, recommended for nice dinner."
16,Tanuki, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best sushi I ever had! And every plate is empty! Really recommend the steak!
17,Tanuki, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Always nice, friendly service. Food standard 3.5 star for me cos its average japanese mainstream food."
18,Tanuki, 3 stars ,a year ago,"I used to go here all the time, as this is one of my fave go-to restaurant. However, the last time I visited after a year, I felt that the quality of food has gone down, such unfortunate. I can compare bcs I almost always ordered the same …"
19,Tanuki, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good fresh food and very friendly polite and patient staff.

Just to make it sure, this is the only one location for the ""Tanuki"" restaurant. …"
20,Tanuki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The restaurant itself is nice, the location is cool, there is an interesting interior design. The food is good, but we need more vegan options. Please take this in considerstion. Also I have a small remark for the staff: when people sit …"
21,Tanuki, 4 stars ,a year ago,The sushi was pretty good. One of the waiters dropped soy sauce over the table and didn't clean it. Had to do it myself. That's the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars
22,Tanuki, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"My home is 50 meters away from the restaurant and I have been eating there for the last 2 years and still, only ones person from the staff knows me;-)
The interior and exterior is great, it reminds me off the typical eateries one …"
23,Tanuki, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Food quality decreased significantly from before.. also, we pointed out one dish wasn't cooked well out of our courtesy but the owner thought we want to get a refund and gave us the attitude by saying ""we cannot take this off your bill"".. …"
24,Tanuki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It's a good place. Especially for lunch. Order the Gyudon (rice and sliced beef). It's a satisfactory meal. Service is great and on a sunny day you can enjoy sitting outside and watch the people pass by as you eat :)
25,Tanuki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It is quite a nice place , cosy, casual and children friendly. Don’t worry if your child doesn’t like sushi, Japanese food is surely not just sushi. My toddler loves the udon there, simply cannot stop the slurping game! Or you can always share your grilled meatballs with them, or order a beef don if they like rice with meat😊"
26,Tanuki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good price. Nice environment. Great and fast food
27,Tanuki, 1 star ,3 years ago,Terrible experience at this place. The sushi and food was ok-ish but you could get much better Japanese food at other restaurants at the same price. What made me never come back to this place again was the service/staff. We ordered a grill …
28,Tanuki, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The place is convenient and has a nice ambience. The service is good. But! They don't use japanese rice for their suchi's and rice bowls...for the price of the dishes you would easily expect quality japanese rice.
29,Tanuki, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Will not come back again.  Service was slow.  The kushiyaki is not delicious. The meat is dry and lacks taste. Probably not well marinated.
A small plate of Yaki udon costs €8,55 which is the same price as the steak. You have to review your pricing for the Yaki Udon."
30,Tanuki, 1 star ,3 years ago,I wish zero or negative rating was possible for this restaurant. Worst dining experience ever. …
31,Tanuki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Still one of the best okey spots good food good atmosphere okey prices many small portions to combine. Some Japanese visitors. idyllic it is ! …
32,Tanuki, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Good food, one of our favourite japanese restaurant. Unfortunately the logistic is not organized always - you could wait for ordered table 15 minutes or more. We canceled our order once because of waiting time and didn't get any understanding - ""Are you hungry? Yes, we are really want to eat now""."
33,Tanuki, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"We had a reservation at 8, arrived just in time and had to wait for 15 minutes. This was a bit of the shame. The food, staff have definitely made up for this as it was just excellent! The timing was right and the good was highly enjoyable! Overall it was a good experience and the prices were very good! I will definitely come back again!"
34,Tanuki, 5 stars ,a year ago,We had wonderful takeaway sushi last night from Tanuki Gelderlandplein. Everything was really fresh and delicious!!
35,Tanuki, 1 star ,3 years ago,"My first time at Tanuki was not a success. The restaurant seemed understaffed and the service was bad. Every time we had to wait very long, before the waiter noticed us. For the drinks we have ordered two coca cola zero, however we got …"
36,Tanuki, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Sushi is delicious. Warm dishes like the steak and udong taste good, but are not very special. Employees are very friendly."
37,Tanuki, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The sushi and dishes are just okay. I ordered the rice dish with grilled eel, but the rice wasn't even Japanese rice. The sashimi piece I also ate had a bone in it and the rice in the sushi was a little too sticky. Wouldn't eat here again and wouldn't recommend it to others!"
38,Tanuki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Pleasant experience.  For lunch they have a different menu and we got the Gyudon. It was tasty and the portion was big enough to fill us up.
39,Tanuki, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I like their new location. It has free parking there for 1,5-2hours depending on where you park. The food is good, wish there were more vegetarian food though. But overall a great place to dine and we will come back here again!"
40,Tanuki, 1 star ,4 years ago,"First of all, food here is at most mediocre. The service is horrible. I ordered takeout on 17:29 when there are not many people in the store. I specifically asked the front desk about my waiting time, and he said 10 to 15 mins. Turns out it …"
41,Tanuki, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I got a raw chicken in the poké ball dish. After the complaint the staff was rude,even brought a piece of chicken,that they took out from a fridge,already prepared, to lecture me on how it's prepared. I have eaten chicken at asian places before and now how it its suppose to taste. They lost an old costumer."
42,Tanuki, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Amazing sushi and a great variety as well!
43,Tanuki, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"We had lunch today and although the staff were friendly, the quality of the food has gone down and the restaurant was dirty. Big layers of dust on the midsection, sticky menu's, dirty tables and flies buzzing around. The smell wasn't nice either. Such a shame, because when it just opened we were super excited and enthusiastic."
44,Tanuki, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good sushi not too expensive. They also have pictures of their whole menu what helps a lot!
45,Tanuki, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very good sushi and some very original dishes, like fried oysters, which are very nice. Also the beef and pork have a truly good taste. A nice place to have a good meal"
46,Tanuki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious sushi and other Japanese dishes
47,Tanuki, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Really good food at acceptable prices, but very packed, definitely need to reserve and the staff is not always in the best mood. Still, the food is worth the effort to take the trip."
48,Tanuki, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great sushi
49,Tanuki, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The lunchsets are really worth the visit!
50,Tanuki, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Very bad service . It can't be worse. You can't any attention from the waitress and you have to beg for ordering or bringing extra spoon. Personally, I had bad experience here . Not recommend"
51,Tanuki, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Amazing Sushi and super friendly staff
52,Tanuki, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Bit of a let down, there is much better sushi places in Amsterdam in that budget range. If you are in Gelderlandplein there is much better food options out there."
53,Tanuki, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good Japanese food, good ambience, good service, nice selections of menus, parking on street near by."
54,Tanuki, 1 star ,2 years ago,Horrible taste! And bad service! Worst than all you can eat.
55,Tanuki, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Izakaya style Japanese restaurant with delicious food. The new location in Gelderlandplein is in modern style and spacious.
