5,Bhatti Pasal, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Amazing momos ‚Ä¶ authentic Nepalese cuisine. Only drawback is the long waiting time, whether be it for getting seating or getting the food served. Order more as there are long gaps between service of dishes."
6,Bhatti Pasal, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Food is delicious, waiters are friendly. The service is a bit slow during rush hours though. We ordered the food from the google photos, haha, the steam pork dumplings are delicious. The dumplings are hot, the ‚Äòsoup‚Äô is cold."

15,Bhatti Pasal, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Dumplings are pretty good. We got pan fried and the tomato sauce. It took awhile for our food to come though - waited a good 15 or 20mins. We weren‚Äôt super hungry so not a big deal, but it was a bit surprising. General service was fine though"
16,Bhatti Pasal, 5 stars ,a year ago,This was our first encounter with Nepalese food and we have enjoyed it a lot! The Momo's were very tasty and filling. The curry noodle soup was also extremely tasty. The chicken was tender and the skin was very crispy. If travel ever brings us back to Amsterdam we will definitely come back! A+ service.
17,Bhatti Pasal, 3 stars ,a year ago,Had the opportunity to eat lunch in December!! Close to authentic Nepali cuisine well prepared and played.HOWEVER!! Most staff is friends n family and not professional Horeca...It shows in their behavior and skills. Ambiance...hole in the ‚Ä¶

48,Bhatti Pasal, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very good dishes and nice personnel.  Courses were aboundant. The place is small so we had dinner outside along the street. It was the first time in Nepalese restaurant. I suggest this food experience. The only thing prices a little bit high.
