2,Pasta Paradijs, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Love this pasta place! They have varieties of yummy pasta. Always struggle what to choose 😋😋😋
3,Pasta Paradijs, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"They've changed the chef and i think co owner since about six months or like that. Wow! Classic Italian food with a lot of respect for the ingredients. Very tasteful and quite low in fat and salt. The chef makes non-changing dishes such as lasange, pasta with ragu (bolognese), carbonara but also varies a lot. Thank you for being here!"
