0,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 1 star ,3 months ago,"If you are a black person please don't come here, it will be traumatic. One of the bartenders called the police on us simply because we asked him how to reserve a table (given the understandable COVID restrictions). Once the police came he told them that we were welcome to come back. Really disturbing and racist person. Sad experience."
1,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 1 star ,3 months ago,"I cannot recommend this place. The staff was incredibly unfriendly and intrusive, which made me feel very upset. My friends and I will not come again."
2,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Good tables, limited beers and snacks. Lacking a bit of ambiance.
Come here to play not for the bar"
3,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great professional pool tables, nice ambience, nice beers. Make sure to reserve your table though!"
4,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 1 star ,3 months ago,The bartender is crazy. He doesn't know how to handle a customer. He is so aggressive and racist. Please try to find another place. Don't waste your time.
5,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great pool club, relaxed atmosphere and good service. Great fun."
6,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place but the only disadvantage is they don't take credit cards which caught us out. Staff are awesome.
7,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 3 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is so great for pool and darts and boardgames as well! The only thing dampening the mood is the staff, who are all quite rude to people who don't know their rules yet. I understand if you can't walk with your beer around the …"
8,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I came here for darts and was not disappointed. They have like 8 boards, all nice ones, electronic scoring for 501, and just a cool vibe. The bartender was super friendly as well and they have a great local beer selection. As an American it …"
9,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 4 stars ,a year ago,"Cozy and straightforward. You've got your pool tables, dart boards, bar, and even a pinball machine! Only downside was the constant interruption by some of the staff who kept going around all the tables to tell everyone to keep their …"
10,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 2 stars ,2 years ago,I really wanted to give a 4 star review. Yet after the treatment I received I was even considering giving 1 stars. …
11,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Spacious area to enjoy some pool games. The place has a lot of tables, however, all were taken when we visited. Wait time was about 10-15 min. Inside there are multiple TVs broadcasting different sports matches, which made the wait at least OK. Also, staff is friendly and helpful."
12,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 1 star ,2 years ago,"Absolutely rude staff, they charged me what had been already paid by the person leaving before me. I was sipping my cider about 10 inches away from the table when I saw an angry woman hurrying towards me. Then she started screaming at me …"
13,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was a really nice, good tables, lots of them and really friendly staff. This is what I have been looking for in Amsterdam. Maybe a bit further away than the usual tourist haunts but if enjoy the game and want to play then it had to be here. Darts also available"
14,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 1 star ,2 years ago,"If it was possible I would definetly rate this with a 0. Incredible rude staff. The barman doesn't know the difference between ""outside of the bar"" and ""the hallway of the bar"". My friend and I take the beer on the hallway and when he …"
15,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,I am talking Pool lessons there so a regular visitor. Plenty of pool tables and also lots of dart boards if that tickles your fancy. Would recommend it on a night out.
16,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 1 star ,2 years ago,"If I could I would rate with 0 stars. I have never seen more idiotic people than the ones there. Not only one but both of the people in the service was extremely rude, and completely unreasonable. The pools were good, but with such a service I wouldn’t suggest it not even to my worst enemy! Never go!!"
17,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,In my opinion the best pool bar in Amsterdam. They have a large amount of good quality tables and cater for professionals as well as first timers. If you want to just come and have a drink there is a large bar with extremely friendly staff and rnough seating for a chilled time.
18,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Superb venue with a great overall atmosphere. Nice owner, helpful & friendly staff. Perfect for a nice game of pool, snooker or darts. Also hosts regular poker tourneys, without any rake or fees! Whish there were more places like this!"

20,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very rude bartender (balding). Doesn't understand common courtesy or customer service. Instead of asking whether I'd like to buy a drink I'm greeted with ""you need to buy a drink, this isn't a picknick terrace"". …"
21,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, customer service amazing, very friendly and great atmosphere. Tables high quailty and fast paced. Overall best experience me and my partner have had in amsterdam in our 4 day visit. Santa and John x"
22,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Found this pool hall after about 7 months living in Amsterdam (they seem quite hard to track down). Mellow atmosphere, super-friendly staff and excellent quality tables. Weighs in at about 11€ per hour, I think I'll end up being a regular there."
23,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 4 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing cafe. You can play pool for a low price. And darting is free you just have to buy consumptions. The tap beer is grolsch wich is not mt favorite. Then it would have got 5 stars in my opinion ;)
24,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great low-key spot for shooting pool, playing darts and drinking beer. The soundtrack generally seems to be 90's rock/grunge and some of the patrons are a bit on the scruffy side... I love it!"

37,"Pool Lokaal ""De Gracht""", 1 star ,4 years ago,"I know it's hard to believe, but they don't let black people in. We used to come here every week, but when my black friend came along, we got thrown out and almost beaten up by one of their thugs for no reason whatsoever. And I thought I've seen everything in Amsterdam..."
