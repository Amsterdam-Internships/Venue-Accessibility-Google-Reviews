0,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The waiter was genuinely the kindest person I’ve met in my entire trip to Europe. I’m from the USA, and I find everyone in Europe to be incredibly rude. This man greeted me with a smile, and specially took into account my peanuts allergy. …"
1,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,4 months ago,First time trying Surinamese cuisine! The portion was huge and really tasty. The staff is great too. Definitely recommend it :)
2,Warung Spang Makandra III, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Very good restaurant with authentic Indonesian and Surinamese food. The portions per person were generous and the staff welcoming
3,Warung Spang Makandra III, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Took 30+ minutes to make the order. Repeated the order multiple times and still didn't give me the right stuff. I asked without egg, they gave us eggs. I asked vegetarian they gave chicken in the veggie soup. Quality use to be good here but they're slacking. Even found a hair in the rice. Will not come back again"
4,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicious food and quickly served. The place is a bit small and service is a bit chaotic, but the waiter was super friendly and nice."
5,Warung Spang Makandra III, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Giancarlo was super welcoming. We ate the lamb and vegetarian dishes with roti and rice. Filling, well flavoured with decent portion sizes. The salt fish and fried cassava was tasty too."
6,Warung Spang Makandra III, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Very good. My 1st Surinamese food, very tasty and good feeling. Beware of the yellow chilli on tables :)
4 stars instead of five because quite worn furniture and no beer to the food :)"
7,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Tasty and with large portion. Don’t accept Visa card
8,Warung Spang Makandra III, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Good and generous food and low prices. But the service is awful and unorganized. The waiter doesn't seem to understand his job.
3 persons successively left : One asked 3 times for his food that never came. 2 …"
9,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Surinamese food! Authentic restaurant, friendly staff, looks like a family business. Very friendly ready to recommend what to try for the first time and didn't disappoint. Small place, people were also doing take away orders."
10,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Best Surinamese food in Amsterdam. Service is great. Sometimes they don't have beers. Price real cheap for Amsterdam and for the quality of the food!
11,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Cosy, tiny restaurant with tasty food. Service was friendly and food authentic. Although it was a modest surrounding, it was the best meal we had during our stay in Amsterdam. And we ate in a few nice Indonesian restaurants."
12,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had yellow curry chicken fillet sandwich and the stewed chicken with noodles.  It's was very similar to a Indonesian meal.  The food was very tasty with fresh made vegetables and light flavors. Be careful of the  yellow spice on the side; it's tasty but VERY hot... And I love hot
13,Warung Spang Makandra III, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Food was average actually.. not as good as I thought.. the noodles were dry and bland.. but the roasted chicken and rendang was really good. Satay was dry but sauce was good. There are Better options for Indon food in Amsterdam :/
14,Warung Spang Makandra III, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The price was ok, not expensive.
The rice and the sauce were good.
I can understand that if you as the waiter do the same thing everyday, you will get bored. But it shouldn't be the reason to be unfriendly."
15,Warung Spang Makandra III, 4 stars ,a year ago,"This place qualifies as a restaurant, albeit a pretty small one (but this is Amsterdam!). It’s great if you’re on a budget, as almost all the items on the menu are less than €10. But they don’t take reservations and they don’t serve …"
16,Warung Spang Makandra III, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice Indonesian and Surinamese food. Big portions as well and really decent prices. Average per head around €12-15. No alcohol served.
17,Warung Spang Makandra III, 1 star ,5 months ago,"I ordered a vegetarian roti and got curry saus on my dish that was made with chicken. There were peace’s of chicken in it. The patates also smell everytime I’ve bought roti there. Not going there anymore, …"

A lot of quality food! …"

24,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good food and cozy and cute atmosphere. I guess Suriname cuisine is between Indian and Chinese ( I would say 70-30) moreover the place is really cheap and the personal very polite.
25,Warung Spang Makandra III, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"This was not a particularly enjoyable meal. I went for the Javanese Rames which was essentially: (1) salty dollop of rice, (2) a chicken satay that lacked a fresh, spicy marinade or a well executed peanut sauce, (3)  vegetables that had had …"

27,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Would give it 6 stars if I could!! Small place, but very very welcoming, friendly service and Food drinks all taste amazing. I recommend the sweet pink coconut drink, homemade ginger beer and the specials meals. Huge portions and very good price"

36,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty food, the roast chicken was amazing! Highly recommend especially because the food is of reasonable price too"
37,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best Indonesian experiences of my whole life. This restaurant is completely delicious and is a must visit. Though a little expensive it's completely worth the spurge. If you want to try something new and a cuisine that's not available everywhere in America I totally recommend this.
38,Warung Spang Makandra III, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The food was really delicious and the portions were generous. Staff is super nice.

41,Warung Spang Makandra III, 4 stars ,a year ago,"If you enjoy Surinamese food, highly recommended. It economical yet tremendously delicious! I would recommend take out seeing as the restaurant is very small. The nasi sate or bami sate with the peanut sauce hit all the right taste buds."
42,Warung Spang Makandra III, 4 stars ,2 years ago,good food and love prices
43,Warung Spang Makandra III, 1 star ,3 years ago,I have no idea why this place has positive reviews. I dined there just last night. 1) our table was not cleaned/given a wipe down when we sat. 2) the food was meh. Adequate but lacking any interesting or complex taste. Sort of like school …
44,Warung Spang Makandra III, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I came here for lunch one weekday, and the restaurant had a few customers. I sat down and was given a menu, and since I didn't know what to order, I asked for a recommendation. He suggested the Spang Makandra special, which came with fried …"

49,Warung Spang Makandra III, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I ate here twice in my short trip because I like rice! This place had quite good food and the first day I went I loved it so I went back another day too. On the second day I went back it had a weird smell.... quite unbearable.... and I …
50,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"LOVE THE FOOD!!! they have huge portion. so for the weight watchers,  you might want to check the size of the portion before ordering. I tried the lamb chop with rice,  the rice was steaming hot,  the meat was tender and tasty.  Careful with the sambal though,  it's extremely hot."

53,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cosy little Surinamese restaurant with great food and staff.

You might also have to share tables but we did not find that to bother us at all."
54,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great tasty food for a cheap price.
The place is a little small, so there isn't always space. I recommend to try the Spang Makandra Special, it's huge and has a bit of everything for only 10 euros."
55,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food. Small restaurant. Ideal location at Di Pijp. Open till late at night. Not very fancy but good quality food. Portion size is also good. For budget travelers with a taste for food - I highly recommend it.

57,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Me and my 10 friends came here as part of our trip to Amsterdam. The host was very welcoming and explained all dishes as there were Vegans, Vegetarians and meat eaters among the group. There was no pressure to make a decision as the host …"

61,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A great unexpected place for a lunch or dinner! Good java and Suriname typical dishes :tasty! Don't expect a calm place or a slow time dinner because it's very crowded and people wait for their turn outside :)
62,Warung Spang Makandra III, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Dont get put off by waiting and small space.. once you get a table the taste of food will make up for the wait. …

Decor: RED
Space: tight (almost cramped) …"

73,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This food—especially the roti—was amazing. It tasted like it came straight from my Guyanese (i.e. the country next to Suriname) grandmother’s kitchen. This is exactly what I was looking for.
74,Warung Spang Makandra III, 5 stars ,6 years ago,I have made it a permanent routine to stop here every visit. Its a hearty meal meant to feel like home. But my mother and family could never create such balancing flavors.
