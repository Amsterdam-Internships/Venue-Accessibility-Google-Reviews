The little time I have available for leisure and enjoyment, and they let us wait 30 minutes for drinks and 1 hour for food: there were more people working(4+) ‚Ä¶"
1,La Casona, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Came here recently and one of the worst service I‚Äôve had. Came in and sat down for at least 10 min until they notice us and it wasn‚Äôt even busy, we sat next to the cash register where the waitress and owner were. It was constant ‚Ä¶"
2,La Casona, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice and cozy place. Everything was perfect, soft atmosphere and food was great, meat was cooked In the way I like (medium rare). There were a pianoforte too! Thanks to the owner, Jolanthe,  I've found the best wine, just to fill me like I drink a good one in Italy. I look Forward to come back to eat here again."
3,La Casona, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent meal, great service üôÇ. Hadn't tried Argentinian before but happy we did. Bottled Argentinian beer hit the spot and the Red was a nice drop too"
4,La Casona, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Amsterdam has an overload of steakhouses labelled Argentinian Steakhouses. We decided to try La Casona due to its atmosphere and offers by the window. ‚Ä¶

12,La Casona, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice place, nice interior and good service"
13,La Casona, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I ordered the ribeye steak and it was delicious. Soft meat. The only thing is that they didn't ask how I liked my meat: rare, medium rare, etc. That was odd for me."
14,La Casona, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Extremely Good! The Bife Ancho was soft and tasty! The service great and I general the restaurant is cozy and lovely!
15,La Casona, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good service when there are a few customers. When it became crowded one lady can't manage it all. Good quality bof meat, but my medium was more raw, than wife's medium-well. Fine wine"
16,La Casona, 2 stars ,3 years ago,I was really looking forward to this because we don't have very many Argentine restaurants where I live.   Had I noticed the number of them here. I would have done more research before I tried this one.   We're ordered the meat combination ‚Ä¶

18,La Casona, 1 star ,2 years ago,The zalm was raw and cold. The spare ribs really too small for 21 euros. I asked for sparkling water and I got normal water. The spinach were without any taste. Maybe it was a wrong evening for them but I don't want to try again.
19,La Casona, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Most disappointing meal I ever had. Don't get me wrong, service is great and the place looks great. However, I'd be really hard pressed to call whatever they try to pass for Bife de Chorizo a steak. Thin, cooked in a pan/gril that was to ‚Ä¶"

22,La Casona, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"The meat is good, but it's served without any garnish whatsoever. The service will of course recommend ordering it separately, which is of course a sensible thing to do. But it's just their way of hiding how much more expensive a normal ‚Ä¶"
23,La Casona, 1 star ,6 years ago,"It is just a trap, dont go: too expensive. I ordered shrimp as apetizer and beef as main dish. They gave me 6 shrimps and cold beef and they charged me 50 euro. If you go to the dustbin of burger king, you will probably find better food."
24,La Casona, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Beef and mais were cold when served! And this is the worst roasted mais ever, it is cold inside and outside is soft! Never in my life ever tried a soft roasted mais. Almost like they just smashed it in microwave and serve it. And mushroom ‚Ä¶"
