0,Litedark, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I had the number 523  Butternut Squash and Goat Cheese Quesadilla along with a green energy smoothie. Excellent food and an affordable lunch by Amsterdam standards. Location is excellent.

4,Litedark, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Seriously tasty food and the juices are top notch too. Tried the power balls (coconut) protein ball, basil xtc juice, SW1 salad of beetroot and goats cheese with luscious scatter of a variety of nuts and the quiche. Yummy. Excellent fuel food for the body. Lovely friendly staff 👌🏼"
5,Litedark, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great selection of delicious and healthy (and reasonably priced) food and drink options - with clear ""free from"" labelling to indicate gluten free, dairy free, nut free options. Comfy atmosphere and friendly, helpful staff. Far too easy to spend a lot longer than you intended! I intend to return."
6,Litedark, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great smoothie selection to choose from! Our go-to breakfast / brunch place.

Also offers nice selection of paninis, wraps/salads and quesadilas - all made fresh on the spot."
7,Litedark, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"The owner can do no wrong in my opinion. High-protein vegetable smoothies, power balls and healthy quiches served by beautiful & friendly staff in a trendy, if small, shop front playing quiet house music all day, every day. The perfect place for sustaining a body in a city with so many abusive temptations."
