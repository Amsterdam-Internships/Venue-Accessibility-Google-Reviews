36,Caf√© Belgique, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Enjoyable small pub, felt like a nice escape from all of the tourist pubs. Felt like I got a real flavour of the pubs/bars of Holland.  Sold a great selection of Belgian ales. A personal favourite was Kwak."

47,Caf√© Belgique, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"A bit strange place. Local and tourists mixing. Can find really good classic Dutch and Belgian beers - not much of the ""new craft"". A tiny space that probably could be very cozy - but we must have been unlucky and drop during a spell of rather peculiar and uninviting atmosphere."
48,Caf√© Belgique, 1 star ,2 years ago,Horrible cheap dive for punks and addicts. I would have never set my foot there if that were not for a local guide who wanted me to see it. I guess he wanted to impress me in his special kind of way. It is literally vomitrocious.
49,Caf√© Belgique, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"This bar is one of Amsterdam's best kept secrets. Just down a tiny alleyway from the walking street, you'll find this whole-in-the-wall place. The beer selection is awesome and there is a ton of energy coming out of such a small bar."
50,Caf√© Belgique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy small bar, with 8 draught beer choices and the other alcoholic suspect's hanging from the bar, relaxed mood and a flowing dj that rides on good vibes mixes via jazz dips, old school vintages&gems. Due to it's -out of sight- location …"
