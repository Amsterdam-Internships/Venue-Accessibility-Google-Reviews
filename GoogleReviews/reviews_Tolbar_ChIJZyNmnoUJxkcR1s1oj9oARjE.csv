0,Tolbar, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Been there last Friday with a group of friends and loved the cozy vibes. They had a DJ playing some music, beer is good and the chairs are amazing, our table was on the stage and we had big armchairs for seats. Had a great time!"
1,Tolbar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Young and artistic environment, vintage atmospheric, simple and nice service, good food, too (especially aubergine & lentils)"
2,Tolbar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love this little find! Very pretty interiors (funky, vintage), great food, and a nice place to have a beer outside during a sunny day! I heard sometimes they host game nights and live music. I‚Äôll definitely come back üëç"
3,Tolbar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Super chill and cozy bar near the Amstel river just outside of the city centre. No whiskey! But they did have bourbon,
so close enough on a winter night. Similar layout to OT301 with both tables and chairs & couches."

The lunch ‚Äúsuper toast‚Äù 6‚Ç¨ was a  piece of bread and cheese.
Totally not worth it."
11,Tolbar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent choice of tap and bottle beers with very attentive staff. Seems 'old school room' furniture is everywhere in Amsterdam bars and eateries these days. 3rd place in 2 days with this style but still a great locals bar just a very short a hop from the Pestana hotel.
12,Tolbar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really great food and drinks for decent price. Bar is kind of lost in a part of the Pijp where a lot of construction are happening. Nonetheless the quiet atmosphere et and nice terrasse are really a big plus. I would come back for sure because the inside seems pretty nice just to sit and work with labtop!

Now, don't tell too many people about this amazing little spot!"
