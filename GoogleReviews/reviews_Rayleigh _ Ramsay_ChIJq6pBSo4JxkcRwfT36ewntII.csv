1,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"My new favorite in Amsterdam, more than 100 wines to choose, nice selection from different countries and great snacks and dishes, I recommend the ribs, the cheese platter and the duck."
2,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Been here twice already and both times have been a great experience. You can choose from a hundred different wines and the dishes are tasty too. It‚Äôs small dishes so you order several and do shared dining.
3,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,8 months ago,A great setting with a fantastic selection of wines that you can select by the glass. Helpful service that checks in with you at the right kind of frequency - not pushy but you‚Äôre not left fending for yourself! ‚Ä¶

5,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Rayleigh & Ramsey is a beautiful venue located in the neighborhood Pijp.

6,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Do not doubt to choose this place if you are looking for a nice wine bar with great atmosphere to have either a romantic evening or a vivid Apero with your friends. The concept of self serving wine exist as well in Paris and i wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Ä¶
7,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Always love going to this wine bar. They have vending machine style wine dispensers where you can try as little or as much wine you want. It works on a refillable card system, which you can use everytime you get a glass of wine. The money ‚Ä¶"

9,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 1 star ,3 months ago,"The place seems very nice, but the service is nothing then short of shame, the bartender super arrogant, we asked if it was possible to sit in one of the two empty tables, we were told that they were booked for dinner, since it was 16.10 ‚Ä¶"
10,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Love this place! So much fun sampling wines and great food too, including gluten-free options."
11,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great wine choice for every taste. I love the concept of wine pouring choices. Friendly staff. Definitely coming back again. The blind wine tasting is not as easy as you think, but definitely fun!"
12,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice wine bar. Visiting it for the second time this month already. They give you a card which you can use to choose any wine on their list, either tasting, half glass or full glass. The wines aren't expensive, and are good. You can also take a bottle of wine home with you if you liked it."
13,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very much like this concept. The experience is very well thought of: add value on the card, use the card to purchase different wines - you can go for small ""sip"" size amounts too. Learn more about the wines from the cards above the taps, ‚Ä¶"
14,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Such a cool place. Great concept to try lots of different wines. Put money on a card, and then find your own wine to try! Very very nice and cozy."
15,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We LOVED our experience here. We stumbled upon this location on our first night in Amsterdam and were drawn in. Such a cool concept and the beiterballen and oysters were delicious. I‚Äôd highly recommend. I wish this place was back home!!
16,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great for tasting different kind of wine for a reasonable price of around 1-3 euro per serving. Nice atmosfeer, the night i was here there were quite popular with the ladies."
17,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great wine selection. Very knowledgeable and helpful in finding the right wine for you. Food is amazing too. Great value for money on top of that. Will definitely go again.

19,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Super fun to try all different wines and different quantities. Super nice idea.
Food is great too.
Not too much of portuguese selection and bar chairs that are uncomfortable"
20,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice wine bar. Good concept. Buy a card with credits and pour your own glass. Very broad assortment. Food is also good but limited choice.
21,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food was good and the ambience was great. However, we got overcharged and despite sending an email to inform them, there is still no sign of remorse (after 3 days). Too bad because we could have been regulars."
22,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 3 stars ,6 months ago,This is a great idea and mostly fun experience to experience different wines from different regions and grapes. The service and the demeanour of the male staff are not great.
23,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing and wide selection of wines. Super recommended if you are a wine lover and you are in Amsterdam
24,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,a year ago,I love this place!!! Amazing wine selection and the concept is great! You can taste a lot of wines and they offer 3 different dose sizes. All the wines are very well presented and there is an easy explanation to help you to choose it.
25,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great concept, good wines. Reminds me a bit of gambling in Las Vegas (a lot of fun!). I only wish I would drink less so the next time I'm there I'll still remember which wines were my favorites. But then again... It's fun!"
26,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good atmosphere and welcoming and helpful staff. A great selection of quality wines, including both your traditional pick of varieties and regions as well as unusual blends and finds. Self service system for the wine works like a charm. Enjoyed a nice sandwich and some cold cuts to go with the wine. Will come again"
27,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good wine and excellent service. Those guys really know about their wines and you can tell they are passionate connoisseurs and experts. Also, it is really nice to have such a lovely staff serving you and really loving what they do. ‚Ä¶"

32,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Come for the wine and stay for the food.‚ù§Ô∏èüç∑Very reasonably priced three course menu with good quality ingredients. The bread is to die for!
Badly labelled menu for vegans thoughüò£üå± ‚Ä¶"
33,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic concept. Not a huge wine drinker myself because I often end up feeling overcharged for mediocre wine. Here you can try a lot of wines in the blink of an eye and find a bunch of great ones. The wine isn't necessarily cheap but ‚Ä¶
34,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Ended up here by accident. Wouldn't be my place of choice because it's obviously 'a concept.' However...it is a concept thought through to serve the interest of it's guests instead of only the business model. I love how you can taste over a ‚Ä¶
35,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The idea is nice and smart however it turns out to be expensive if you keep trying new wines. The system is simple: you get a card, top it up and use it to chose the wine you wanna test (you have 3 choices - small, medium and full glass). ‚Ä¶"
36,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Cool concept where you can pour your own wine with a prepaid card. You can choose several servings so you can try a bunch of different wines. It's a quite small space with limited outdoor seating.
37,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice ambient and cool wine concept. You can choose your wine from multiple dispensers. In the case you are not such a wine expert you can always read  about the wine on a small note placed just above the bottle and still not sure if you ‚Ä¶

40,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I'm so grateful that a friend took me here once and I've been a fan since. It is like a wine degustation experience but you control what you drinks and how much you spend. Saturday's 1Eur oysters is delish too.
41,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It was an amazing experience! I went to this place without knowing about their concept, which I find very clever and fun! It is now definitely one of my favorite places in Amsterdam! The food was also very good, and the staff is very friendly as well. Can't wait to try out also the Overtoom branch!"

45,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was a nice concept place. First of the kind I have been to, you can try different kinds of wine, they seemed to have plenty. I mostly tried the dry white wine."

47,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I can't believe I have never reviewed this place. We live it here. It's such an amazing place to bring friends and visitors. The prices are great and the food is really good. The staff is very helpful and the amount of outdoor setting is plentiful.
48,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 5 stars ,a year ago,"How can you beat oysters for 1‚Ç¨ each on a Saturday? Simple, you can't. Agusti Torello Mata cava and oysters and you're set for life. You're welcome!"
