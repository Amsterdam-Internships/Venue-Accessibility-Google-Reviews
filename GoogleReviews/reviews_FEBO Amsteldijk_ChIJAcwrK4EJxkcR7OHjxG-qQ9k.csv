0,FEBO Amsteldijk, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"A lovely FEBO store with very friendly service and great food. It‚Äôs alway a pleasure to go to the oldest franchise FEBO in Amsterdam and they have a real passion for customer service and the delivery of good snacks, food in a safe and clean environment."
1,FEBO Amsteldijk, 2 stars ,2 months ago,I wanted to buy a snack here but when I saw the mess of a lot of garbage of previous customers in front of the Febo I decided to bike on. What to expect at the inside when they don't keep the entrance clean? It looks like a achterbuurt.

11,FEBO Amsteldijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"""Febo has given life to a concept that was once popular in the 50's: the concept of the automat. It is like a vending machine for hot and ready food. The food is not the best but it is quick and comforting. It matches the inn the go lifestyle of those in Amsterdam"" - Ansel Ponce Diama"
