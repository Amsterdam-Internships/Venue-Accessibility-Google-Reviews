6,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Great ambience, cool menu design, big plates and one of the best brownies in town. If they have richer beer menu, they are my favourite ribs place."
7,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Definitely recommend the Cannibale craft beer, it was delicious! The Cannibale Royal burger was tasty as well, the meat well cooked but it was too heavy because of the pork I assume! The steak was excellent! ‚Ä¶"

10,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"A nice place with cool, chilled environment and very friendly staff. We just had a few drinks and nachos outside, but the nachos were just average. Good service and super well located in Amsterdam."
11,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Great place for a beer and some food. The burgers were really good. Can be noisy in some places.
12,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"We sampled a lot of different dishes and each was mouthwatering good. The ribs were tender and juicy, the Cannibale Royale burger was loaded and an explosion of flavor. The side dishes really rounded off the mains. But my absolute favorite were the cauliflower wings-- to die for."
13,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,a month ago,"We took a short trip from Belgium to Amsterdam and on the first day we arrived we went to this restaurant and we LOVE it here!

We ordered ribs, steak and potato fries which were all delicious. Price is a bit on the expensive side, but the quality of the food is great!"
16,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 2 stars ,a month ago,"I was really disappointed, as I've read excellent reviews on this restaurant, particularly on their spareribs.
The spareribs are really bad, super dry, and without taste. Only bearable when you dip the ribs in some sort of sauce like bbq sause. Avoid"
17,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Cannibale Royale is a place you should visit at least once if you go to Amsterdam - incredible selection of steaks, burgers, beers and wines - it's fantastic for a night out on the weekend! The food is very high quality and the vibe of the ‚Ä¶"

31,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,a year ago,"This is the second time I went to Cannibale Royale and the food is just amazing. The nachos were so much and so good but sadly I couldn't finish them because of how much it was. The cheesecake, however, it's the best cheesecake I've had yet. They could work on their service though, it was already but could be better."

35,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,7 months ago,We didn't have any reservations during the rush hour but the waiter helped us and was so kind. We had a chance to taste their delicious meat. It was a very good dinner and the staff was very kind.

37,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,3 years ago,One of the most delicious sandwiches I have had in a while! The pulled pork sandwich has a kind of sweet and tangy barbecue sauce on the chunks of nicely charred and smoked pork. What made it special was the horseradishy slaw. Perfect ‚Ä¶
38,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was okay. The tartar seemed like beef patties they use for their burgers slapped together. Kind of unappealing. Service was quite slow and our server forgot about our meal. We waited about 30 minutes thinking it was coming, but she ‚Ä¶"
39,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent location, snugly tugged in a side street in the lively de Pijp neighbourhood. I heard a lot about the restaurant and it definitely lived up to its fame! ‚Ä¶"
40,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It's a decent place to eat, the taste of the food was good despite the fact that my burger was cooked too much through in my opinion. The selection of beers is very nice and the Ambiente is also a good one, from the prices it is a little more on the expensive side but they do back it up with a good service and quality food."
41,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 1 star ,a month ago,Normal burger and definitely not worth the 50 min wait for the food to arrive (the place was not full to justify the wait).
42,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Thr place was at a nice location, nearvthe canal. However, the waiter forgot our order, I waiter for a pair od burgers for 45 minutes. At least the waiter gave us a round on the house. The food was delicious but the service not so much. If not for that it would be 4 or 5 out of 5. Still I would recommend this place."
43,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 1 star ,6 months ago,Had it delivered and so surprised that it was the worst ribs that we've ever had. The ribs were burnt and the meat was extremely dry and falling apart but not in a good way. We couldn't even try to finish it. Then the Mac n' Cheese was ‚Ä¶

54,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"We reserved a table at 16:30, we ordered at 17:00 and we ate 17:30! The ribs were cold! The service was very bad and rude!"
55,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to come for casual drinks and nice burger selection. Not many choices for vegetarians. Can get busy so there might be a wait or book in advance, there are long bench tables so good for large groups too. Interesting decor that plays to the name of the restaurant."
56,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 1 star ,4 months ago,The food is good but nothing very special you can‚Äôt do yourself. Not worth the price. And the waitering not go good.
57,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best dinner I had in Europe! Excellent from top to bottom. Service, atmosphere, quality, this place offers it all!"

60,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Great drinks. I have recently learned that ""tortilla chips"" in Europe are not real tortilla chips, even in ""Mexican"" restaurants. Just don't order the ""nachos"""

62,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I definitely recommend this place if you like good meat. I had a burger royal and I tried spareribs as well. In both meat was amazing! I suggest you to order the burger!!
63,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the better places I‚Äôve been to Amsterdam for a good burger (and according to my friends even better spare ribs). The staff was very friendly. And make sure you reserve a table. And the interior is great
64,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food and great service, can't go wrong with some ribs and Mac 'n cheese!"

70,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Good food (ribs and a few sides) though judging by other reviews this is not consistent. Service however appalling. Despite a booking, took ages to be greeted and seated. 10 mins until we got menus. Another 10 to order drinks. Another 10 to ‚Ä¶"
71,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 1 star ,10 months ago,Do not go if you are hungry. You will end up starving. Average order takes 30-45 minutes to get on your table if you're lucky. Always ask the waiter/waiteress about your order because there is a %90 chance they forget. Ribs are great but the experience is bitter.
72,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Here i've eaten the best ribs ever(before this,my no 1 used to be in Prague)! Not fat at all and the meat was falling apart when touched with the fork. You need a reservation if you want to eat here so be sure not to miss it."
73,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 2 stars ,8 months ago,Our experience was really disappointing despiting the hype around the brand of the restaurant. None welcomed us with a smile. We waited over 25 mins to get our drinks ordered and on top other 15 for our food to get orderd. The order was ‚Ä¶
74,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great burgers. I‚Äôve no idea how they get the steak in the burger to be so melt-in-the-mouth. Yum! The fries are also nice.
75,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"The food are good.  But about the service, we ordered one more beer and the dessert after the main dishes , took 20 mins to serve us, all they care is only the big table behind us."

77,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, ambiance and staff! Excellent place to have a beer and burger or steak. Highly recommended"

80,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great interior decoration, good music at the background and friendly staff. Prices are medium to high but the food quality is high so fair prices in the end. Nachos and bbq ribs are delicious, worth trying. We ordered Long Islands to drink ‚Ä¶"

83,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,4 years ago,This place has such a unique and spooky environment to it. I ordered the steak and it couldn't have been any better. It's a bit pricey but for the quality of the food it's definitely worth it.

135,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good place for meet, burgers and amazing deserts."
136,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This one does not have Heineken as the basic beer and I like it :) Ribs are my pure love. I don‚Äôt know but every time I get here in the middle of a Sunday I feel myself like in a movie. Cozy and peaceful and cinematic. The stuff is very friendly and super fast
137,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place lovely atmosphere and the steak was some of the nicest I have tried in a while well worth a visit
138,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The place has some good burgers, but that's all. The rest is full of hype. Next to that customer service is below average (taking advantage of the hype), so I didn't really enjoy my visit there. We went with a group of colleagues and we ‚Ä¶"
139,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Awesome burgers. Best we had in a long time. Open till late!
140,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Service was fast in spite of it being really busy :) We shared the tasting plate that had ribs chicken brisket ect. Ribs were amazing! Brisket was a bit over done but still tastey. A bit pricy and make sure you book ahead
141,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved the food and great atmosphere! Feel like we found the local Amsterdam not the touristy places on the high street. Food was incredible, staff were very friendly and helpful. Ribs are amazing (a must have) stake and burgers were decent too."
142,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Delicious food! Classic burger is a sculpture of goodness, beef salad had a nice balance of veggie and protein. Delish fries! They were out of their apple pie but house beer brewed by Three Chefs was a nice refresher. Loved the industrial vintage decor too. Great lunch overall."
143,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Ribs are just fantastic. Burger is above average too. Sides can be better. But should definitely try the ribs. Also I would like to add that the bitterballen was not fully cooked. Mistakes can happen so I do not think that is a big issue. ‚Ä¶
144,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Food and and drinks is what is to be expected from a outdoor bar, but service is non existent."
145,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very good hamburgers but I was expecting they are better. Very busy and you have to make a reservation. Service friendly but a bit chaotic. They took reservation for our friend and told us we can stay but then somebody else told we have to move to table (for 4 people) but we were with 8 people. We cancelled order and left. Good beer

150,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Mouth watering steaks and friendly atmosphere. Service can be a slow and disorganized at the door sometimes but overall a place to keep coming back! Make sure you have a reservation before coming as it normally gets very busy.
151,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love this place, nice outdoor seating, great food.  (Make a reservation if you want a table inside.). I get Le Modiste (steak), garlic bread, watermelon feta basil salad, and an old fashioned.  The ribs are also great."
152,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,4 years ago,I am a bit torn about the amount of stars. As for the food I would give 5 stars. I had a great meat-eating experience. The steak was very tasty and the quality of it was also great. I was there with my little daughter. I wouldn't suggest going there with kids. That is why I couldn't give a 5 star review
153,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Simple and nice place to eat a burger, price is very good compared to the quality"
154,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Nah. You can find better.

156,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I had the best frst night in Amsterdam thanks to this spot! Even if I was late they managed to feed me the best hamburger I could hope for. Fresh ingredients. Lovely people. Great crowd. Clean and great variety of beers.
Dessert came from next door."
157,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for meat and beer. Good service :)
158,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"If you are a meat lover, Cannibale Royale is definitely a restaurant to stop by. I would definitely recommend the Cannibale Royale burger, the ribs or any of the steaks (depends on how hungry you are, but Le Modeste should be fine most of ‚Ä¶"

162,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"my lamb dinner was very disapointing... quite undercooked, blank, and a very small portion. everyone else ordered steaks and sounded happy so i am rating it two stars instead of one, also because beer is fine and service is fast...  but do NOT make my mistake and order lamb here!"
163,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Tasty ribs However letting them marinate for days is great to have fast service but I think it removes the freshness of the meat when served. Sides could be cheaper. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff
164,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,a year ago,My favorite place! Best meat and sweet potatoes. Every restaurant is the same. Good service good food. Absolutely delicious!
165,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"OMG! Loved this spot! Atmosphere was electric! Lively and bustling, with conversations in multiple languages heard throughout the place. Reggae and hip hop music wafted thru the speakers and the staff kept the patrons in good spirits. We ‚Ä¶"

172,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place with friendly staff. Short Ribs were very good. Didn't try the meat but my colleagues did and comments were not bad but nothing special.
The place can be tight for big groups."
173,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I love Cannibale. The interior is an awesome rustic setting and the food is absolutely top notch. They have great beers on top and fantastic selection of beef and amazing pork ribs. I love it here!
174,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is simply delicious. The atmosphere and the music in the background was perfect! I heard the latest afrobeats, hip hop and r&b  all whilst eating an excellent menu of food."
175,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Smells like toilet half of the time. Food is a bit pricey compared to both size and quality in other places around Amsterdam for meat lovers. But the kitchen is open till late at night so if you're in Amsterdam mode and feel like meat it can be great
176,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"For special occasions I love going to Cannibale, for the best ribs and burgers.

I had a blast, as alwaysüòÑ ‚Ä¶"

180,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was good and the setting great. We stumbled upon the place and were not disappointed. One star removed as I got a British beer when I asked for a Dutch beer. No biggie though, even though the beer I got is a bit of a standard beer at home, it is still a good beer."
181,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing experience! Nice staff, cozy place, amazing food and beer. We had beef tartar and spare ribs.... delicious delicious delicious."

186,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Superb food as always, really enjoyed the seasonal pumpkin salad too. Unfortunately, the experience was spoiled by the mouse living under the fridge and periodically running around. I know it's de Pijp but it was hard to eat and watch it at the same time :) Hope something can be done about it. Cheers!"
187,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Just had the very best ribs I ever had.
Great vibe, excellent service! Really n amazing place in Amsterdam. Top hospitality, and delicious food!"
188,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is still amazing!!! but at this location they have to get their service a bit in order. Service was a bit slow and the board on which the steak was served on had a crack, so the steak juice dropped through the table all over my legs."
189,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We were in √Åmsterdam for a stag party amd we has such good time in there. We made a reservation as we were a large group and they prepared a table on the second floor for us when de were really confortable. The food das great and the atmosphere of the place is cool.

205,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Spare ribs are what you want to get from here, do not bother with anything else.  The kitchen staff deserve all the kudos for working with the levels of Chaos created by this place‚Äôs quite deserved popularity (trust me, as a delivery person I would know) . 8/10."
206,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Good menu. Bit crowded for what it is--pretty simple burgers and steaks. Don't understand the fuss. Be sure to make reservations if going on a Friday or Saturday night.
207,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I wasn't very hungry so got a starter and it was the best ever!  Highly recommend if you're in the area... Or make the trek if you have too. Ribs looked awesome.
208,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Nice steaks and cocktails. Very good service. Book in advance as it's usually packed with people. We tried to get in without a booking one evening and couldn't find a table.
209,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent beer list. Ribs tasted good but were a little dry. The garlic broccoli is delicious!
210,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"dinner for 2 (5 steaks,2 tartar, 3 broccoli,1 stew) only 140euro"
211,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food highlight of the trip! Those ribs! very fast and acommadating to my requests, and the back room is a very good place to sit if you need a little less noise. WIll be coming back!"
212,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"First place I went for food in Amsterdam and it was a total delight. They managed to squeeze us in without a reservation, and really really did a great job with us. Plus the food was very very tasty! Can't recommend it enough."
213,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Much the same as every other place in Amsterdam.  Relaxed sure but service is variable. Outdated menus (ie they didn't do the beers or wine we ordered). ‚Ä¶

217,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good place if you want to eat meat. Prices are decent. Service is good. Ribs were not the best I've had but good enough
218,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Cannibale Royale has had better days. Ribs nowadays come overdone and the burgers dry. It's a good place to grab a cocktail still.
219,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food and atmosphere. Good value. Service friendly and a tad slow but it was jam packed!
220,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"The meats are of good quality, as well as the sides. Service was unfortunately mediocre. And keep an eye out for their wine menu, you don't always get what you order."
221,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really vibrant atmosphere. Food is delicious with a great selection to offer. Staff is very friendly & helpful.

223,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Excellent food and excellent opening hours, but the service needs some improvement as they consistently get orders wrong and are quite slow.
If you're craving for a burger and meat after regular opening hours, this is your mecca."
224,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food is absolutely amazing here and the vibe is really cool. The only downside probably is that it gets quite loud and it might be difficult to hear everyone in your group.
225,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"If you're a cannibal, a perfect place to eat your kind of meat. Make sure to reserve beforehand too busy.  Turns out there's still a lot of meat lovers in the world"

234,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome little bar with great Atmosphere. We've been there for a couple of hours to have some beers. Definitely worth the visit!

241,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Good place for meatlovers with descent variation of beers. Prices are lets say Amsterdsmish. Service is friendly but not always around or on the lookout.
242,Cannibale Royale Ruysdael, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The ribs are delicious. The meat just slides off the bone. Definitely an excellent place for ribs.
