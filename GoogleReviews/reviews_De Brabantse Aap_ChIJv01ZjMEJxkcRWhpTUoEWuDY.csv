0,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Popped in for lunch after the Amsterdam Dungeon. Sat inside. Food was good, but drinks were better. Had a few good beers on draught. Full bar. Seating was a little tight, and service was the greatest, but overall an enjoyable experience. I would return. Didn‚Äôt have hugely high hopes based on the outside, but it exceeded my expectations."
1,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"We had lunch there today and the food was good - not awesome, but fair and honest. Would eat there again. We had the falafel sandwich and the chicken one and they were both tasty. Beers good, of course!"
2,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great Cafe in a great location. Staff were super friendly and the beer selection could not be better. We got the spicy nachos and burger and were happy.
I definetly recommend the ipa on tap or the home brewed trippel"
3,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I can definitely recommend the huge selection of beers and the Moscow Mule was very good as well. They also have some snacks, sandwiches and burgers."
4,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,a month ago,Super friendly staff. It's a very small but cozy bar. I suggest you go alone and strike up a conversation at the toog
5,De Brabantse Aap, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Drinks and cheesecake were pretty good, but steak was suprisingly small and flooded with pepper sauce. You just don‚Äôt do it to a good steak. I would leave with not so bad experience, but one of the waiters (brunet) was so terribly arrogant that I would even consider one star for this kind of behaviour."
6,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to stop for a quick bite. My friend had to try the Dutch snack so we stopped here. Very friendly and quick service. Good food. My coffee was excellent. Visit here if you're passing through!
7,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We stopped here to give our feet a rest and have a quick beer! The location is awesome and they have a great variety of beers! Would like to try the food at some stage as well!
8,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very pleasant 'bruin cafe' pub. The best features are the wide variety of beer and the quietness. No loud music, very bearable noise level. The food is nothing special, just decent Dutch beer bar menu."
9,De Brabantse Aap, 1 star ,7 months ago,Do not recommend going here when it's busy. Waited half an hour for food only to receive one dish wrong and another dish missing. Solution was to offer a 'free drink on the house' while waiting (which we declined)... we told them to just ‚Ä¶
10,De Brabantse Aap, 2 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Friendly but very slow service, we ordered the Hamburger, it was over cooked and filled with bbq sauce, the bun was also stale, one of the worst me hamburgers I have ever had"

18,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Great service and beers, could do with at least one vegan snack option besides fries though!"
19,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,a year ago,they have some very nice local beers (love the De Manke Monnik ) that go very well with their home baked beer bread (yuuum!! ) that gets served right out the over with beer butter. i had the ribs as well there and they were very tasty ! ‚Ä¶

24,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Everything is good, it is just a little bit more expensive than other similar places"
25,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,3 years ago,chicken burger with a beer. It was good spot to eat the lunch. Kind waiters and good taste.
26,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice place in terms of food (affordable) and a great beer selection. Almost missed my flight trying all the beers they have, only got to 8 of them and can tell you they were amazing. Wish I had more pictures but was crowded and am always polite toward others privacy. Worth to check this place, it's cozy."
27,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Their 4 brews are good n other 5 on tap. Good bartender( may be not on busy days according to him)
28,De Brabantse Aap, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place to eat lunch. The service is very good! But the food is just okay.
29,De Brabantse Aap, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Crowded and touristic spot but with their own brewed beer and friendly staff still a good place to visit, just be patient when looking for a spot to sit at night."

33,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,De Blonde Barbier is great.
34,De Brabantse Aap, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Always thought how lovely would it be to visit this place.. Amazing location.. Unfortunately, the food wasn't really well cooked, we were 2, when we asked to pay separately the bartender rolled his eyes at us! Although was talking to them ‚Ä¶"
35,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,4 years ago,happy to see that the food specials are back. they also had some mediocre waiters but improved on that topic. the fries are better than one would expect and the beer selection is great. with good weather the outdoor area is neat to watch people
36,De Brabantse Aap, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Reasonable beer selection. This was the first place I ever drank Duchess De Bourgoyne. I'm not sure about the rest of the food because every time we eat at the Brabantse I choose the satay chicken. That's all I've ever eaten here. I'm sure ‚Ä¶
37,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Nice place.  Favorite location and best fries in the city.

39,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Good Food Good service. Great place to have a bite and drink
40,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We went here for some drinks and some sandwiches. Drinks were good, the sandwiches were great. The sandwich options look on the expensive side (8-9 euros),but actually you get a lot for your money and they are delicious. Staff is friendly and in for a laugh. Restrooms were ok."
41,De Brabantse Aap, 1 star ,2 years ago,Rude staff sending us away after serving beers at wrong table then expecting us to drink it. Dutch treatment proper. Bathrooms really dirty as well. Rather spend money elsewhere. We left after waitress refusing giving our beers. Crazy staff. Apparently new tourists coming there daily so place keeps existing.
42,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Stopped here for a quick beer on a sunny day. Seats overlooking the canal or under the canopy if you wish. Serve own brewery beers and Guinness, selection of hot and cold drinks. Food available but we didn‚Äôt eat here."
43,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had some aged cheese and ox sausage sandwich. We had a beer tasting tray as well. Superb all-round. ‚Ä¶
44,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Nice drinks and really enjoy the location!
45,De Brabantse Aap, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very touristy place. It's ok for a beer, food is less the mediocre and overpriced for what you actually get. I asked the chap for a well done burger for which he assured me all they  were cooked well done in there and ended up with a medium ‚Ä¶"
46,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,2 years ago,They have some really good home brewed beer! Especially liked the IPA and the White Antonia! I also had a very tasty Falafel burger that I can just recommend.
47,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely brown caf√© by the canal. Kind of a busy street next to Spui but stopped by on a Saturday night and it was pretty much empty, which I quite enjoyed, since I wasn't looking for any excitement at the time - not sure if too good for ‚Ä¶"
48,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice patio with friendly service staff! Went for some late night drinks and snacks on a Saturday night, and did the same again a week later. Not a huge beer list, but some great offerings none the less. Highly recommended!"
49,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"When we are in Amsterdam we often end up here for dinner or drinks. Very friendly service and great warm atmosphere. Always crowded for their reasonable prices, great beer and wine selection and tasty menu including local specialties and fish. But also excellent coffees, desserts and finger foods."
50,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,6 years ago,I had a memory of visiting here for a quick beer on my first trip to the city back in 2007 and remembered it being nice. So after nearly 8 years I decided to pop in for some lunch on my most recent trip to Amsterdam and wasn't disapointed. ‚Ä¶
51,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place for their in house beers.
52,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The beer was great, and the server had humor. Would recommend if you want a place to get a beer. The prices were also very reasonable, especially for Amsterdam."
53,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love this pub, we come here every time we're in Amsterdam, it's a great place to stop for a beer after a very early flight and a walk from Central Station. Looking forward to visiting again next week and having some of their own beer üòã"
54,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice decent place for a beer, great for people watching, even in winter, due the glass-front room. Usually service in Amsterdam's touristic places is bad, but this is a positive surprise with polite staff! I've been a few times already. Hope it stays like that :)"
55,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good beer, very good beer! I like this place is good for people watching."
56,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is delicious and nicely delivered, staff is polite and welcoming and speaks English other than Dutch. There are games you can play like chess, jenga etc. Clean toilet. Not expensive at all. 5 stars"
57,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Beers on tap are mass market plus the nearby ""converted nun"" local brews, which is a bit of a disappointment (replace the mass market taps, boys!).  Very good bottle selection and the food is OK for dutch pub grub.  Service was excellent, helpful, and noticeably quick."
58,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Solid bar in Amsterdam. At least 4 house beers. Had a particularly strong and delicious blonde beer, a welcome change from west coast american IPA's (less heartburn!). Enjoyable stop in the area."

60,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Good beer and good food in a good location. It's my go-to meetup place in Amsterdam. It can get crowded at times, but if you keep your eyes peeled you can usually find a table in a corner somewhere. They also allow dogs."
61,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wide range of special beers, friendly service, nice view over Spui, not too far from Amsterdam Centraal station, a bit pricey, but not more expensive than most similar businesses. Great opening times, Amsterdam deserves more locations that don't close too early in the evening."
62,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice little bar with a good selection of drinks and bar food. For a place as centrally located as this one, there's no sense of overcrowdedness or noise, as the inside area is quiet (save for some talk-noise) and the outside area is just ‚Ä¶"
63,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Popped in as it was close to where I was and it was raining (any excuse, right?) It was quite busy, around 9pm but the far end of the bar welcomed like a quiet oasis after trying to catch the Piccadilly line to Heathrow airport. ‚Ä¶"
64,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Visited a number of times during my recent trip to amsterdam. Excellent selection of beers both on tap and bottled. Staff we're friendly and helpful and the food was reasonably priced, tasty and well presented. Would definately visit again when in amsterdam."
65,De Brabantse Aap, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We ordered two salads, which were dry and the lettuce was not fresh and had brown spots on it. When we asked for olive oil and vinegar twice it still wasn't there so after 15 minutes after we got the salad I walked to the bar and then got ‚Ä¶"

Bad: Food is very disappointing (had nachos and steak/fries), expensive for what it is"
68,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cosy place, but very popular for tourists. Quite busy during peak hours. Good beer selection, but not the best in town. Personell is OK, not really friendly. Would not go here with big groups. Food is nice."

71,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Good food, nice environment - you can sit outside if you're a smoker and they've got heaters so you won't freeze to death.
The toilet is a bit dirty but everything else is great."
72,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of my favorite bars in Spui. It is nice to sit outside (if there is sun of course) and have your drink. Prices are good and they have their own beer which is really good.
73,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely bar/bistro with a interesting menu and even better view. Cozy atmosphere and cheerful host. Would definitely come again to have lunch or dinner sometime.

75,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The friendly and hardbworking staff together with the good beers and cosy Christmas decorations make this place a perfect stop to warm up after strolling around in the Amsterdam canals or shoppingstreets. We often stop by for a drink or snack here.

77,De Brabantse Aap, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Just had a lovely evening here. Great food - the beer bread and butter is JUST AMAAAZING - a great selection of beers and the best mix of music!! ‚Ä¶

88,De Brabantse Aap, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good pub in a central location, gets very busy at times due to the central location and although it's on a canal it's seating is not towards. Good, but they're are better places in the city."
