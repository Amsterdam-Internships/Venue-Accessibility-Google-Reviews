0,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Great terrace! Beautiful in the afternoon sunshine. Very friendly and attentive staff with great beer recommendations. We had the IPA on tap and bitterballen and it was a really good time. Definitely recommend!
1,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,a week ago,"Lively spot, good atmosphere. Cheese fondue was very good. The only downside is that the music was very loud. Difficult to have a conversation."
2,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The cafe is located on the corner of the Sarphati park, catching some great sun and people watching. It has a laid back atmosphere with comfortable seating to enjoy the buzz of the park and the city. It includes very attentive, local staff ‚Ä¶"
3,Sarphaat, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice, reasonably priced food. Quick service when you arrive but hard to get a second drink or the bill even though it wasn't busy when we were there."
4,Sarphaat, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"service was very slow, because of that we had to buy 5 fried chicken  por 10‚Ç¨ no steakhouse at van woustraat (it was very good üòÖ) tks"
5,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"A low key place to grab a drink. They have a large selection of drinks, a nice terrace and it it‚Äôs not so ‚Äúhyped‚Äù as many other places in De Pijp. The food is OK for the price"
6,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice, friendly bar with lovely food. Will definitely be going back during our stay in Amsterdam. Helps that its opposite the hotel were staying also... Brilliant food, brilliant atmosphere."
7,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice and cozy bar/cafe. Don't need any reservations if early, but ask if necessary, nice place for a quick drink. Literally next to the park."
8,Sarphaat, 1 star ,a year ago,They serve Hot Gluhwein in plastic bottles... would you drink from these melted bottles? Doesn't really look safe. Stay away if you care about your health!
9,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great Lunch Great Vibes.
The atmosphere is welcoming and warm, helpful and professional staff, good music. Perfect spot for lunch or aperitivo."
10,Sarphaat, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Generally a nice place, but they need to get basic ventilation in their toilets because that's a covid hotbed (on top of smelling dirty). ‚Ä¶"
11,Sarphaat, 1 star ,a year ago,TLDR: these people are willing to forget about your booking to make some extra money. Never going there ever again. ‚Ä¶
12,Sarphaat, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Nice ambience, delish snacks food and desserts. Good drink selection. The 3 stars are for the staff in the room: a better team work and more organization will make a better service to the customer."
13,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This place is great! What a great location, they have a great selection, the food looks delicious (only had drinks), and the prices are fair further area. I love the park nearby and the people watching, the staff is friendly and even their regular guests are friendly! I plan to visit often"
14,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Nice bar with options for seating inside and outside. Standard selection of beers and good service
15,Sarphaat, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice seating next to a park, fair amount of beers on the menu and good nachos. Would not recommend the steak nor spareribs though. Service is mostly good but can falter a bit sometimes."
16,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great place to grab a beer and catch up
17,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"What a chill place to hang out and have a few drinks! Few but good options for beers on tap, they offer sandwiches and some typical bar bites which were very well done. The atmosphere is very cozy and charming. I've only been there during daytime, so I don't know how busy it can get. I would expect it to be super busy!"
18,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,7 months ago,perfect location if you are a mysterious local that likes to enjoy a drink and watch the tram pass by xx
19,Sarphaat, 1 star ,11 months ago,Selling 4 Heineken beer can (350ml) at 13EUR to go. It is ridiculous. They also did not show the price upfront. I never go back again.
20,Sarphaat, 2 stars ,2 years ago,I've lived in the area for a year and this place was always on the list to go if the need arose. We finally went. No need to go back. It was a Sunday late morning the owners were in (at least we think it was the owners. They acted like ‚Ä¶
21,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Since I only have enjoyed a beer here, I can't give a 5 star rating.  What I can say is the atmosphere was inviting, the bartender was friendly and the recommended beer was delicious.  I was able to enjoy a lovely view of the park and people watch while sipping on a lovely dark beer."

23,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Nice and friendly staff. Nice food.
24,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a great place to grab a beer in the winter and summer - a rare combination in Amsterdam.  There‚Äôs plenty of outdoor seating allowing you to sip a cold beverage while you watch the commuters cycle home. In the winter, snuggle inside for a pint while you listen to the eclectic music choices."
25,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Loved the caf√© when I was here exploring Amsterdam on foot. It was cold and I needed a place to pee. Went in and ordered a coffee, the coffee was great and the cookies were really good. The staff is very helpful and the caf√© had a retro European feel to it."
26,Sarphaat, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Not impressed by the service. Waiters seemed to be very unpleased by the fact we played board games, they placed the filthy foot of our beers on the cards to show discontent!!! It used to be one of our favorites but we would not recommend it anymore. Food used to be ok, but not great either."
27,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,a year ago,Fantastic restaurant and they have the best Coffee in Europe. Love it and we. Enjoyed the breakfast. Super friendly staff.
28,Sarphaat, 1 star ,5 years ago,"It was promising at first, but most of the staff turned out aloof and the food didn't contain what it said in the menu (i.e. salad with quinoa was without quinoa and any of the promised grilled/ marinated vegetables). In the end the food ‚Ä¶"

31,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Ate here last week and was the best meal we had, and we had some great ones. I had ribs and daughter burger. Fresh, hot and tasty. Lovely staff and not bad prices."
32,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Bread for the table (on the house), cheese fondue that still came with a heap load of food made for dunking into the delicious creamy mixture! We shared the fondue and curly friets between three of us and it was such a treat! Definitely check this place out!"
33,Sarphaat, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice pancakes and drinks but not the most spectacular restaurant in the neighbourhood. They have warm terrace with blankets though so nice place for a drink and a snack. üëç
34,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great gl√ºwein and great people. Only takeout over limited hours but always worth it in the cold weather!
35,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great neighborhood place for us. Good food, drinks and atmosphere. For lunch, dinner or just an evening drink."
36,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Ordered the special of the day which was a cordon bleu. Came with salad and fries for ‚Ç¨12.50. Lots of food and good price. Would return for more. Friendly staff.
37,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice cafe. You can enjoy weather and sit outside in summer. Also its not so crowded. The nachos are delicious here.
38,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Good place for a meal and drinks.
39,Sarphaat, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Seemed like we needed to do their job. Constantly had to keep asking for random things. It also took awhile for just nachos.. but the atmosphere is nice.
40,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Loved my food. Excellent coffee.. Superb customer service even with the fact that only one waiter was on duty...
41,Sarphaat, 2 stars ,10 years ago,The food is really bad and you might have to remind your server a few times of what you ordered. It's nice to sit outside and have a few beers though and the bitterballen are good.
42,Sarphaat, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Looks nice, but their takeaway is just miserable, and overpriced for hot drinks."
43,Sarphaat, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I ended up here for dinner, because it just started raining. The staff was decently attentive, the atmosphere was nice and the food was nothing special. Not really any distinct things to complain about, it's definitely alright, especially considering the price. But nothing memorable either"
44,Sarphaat, 1 star ,3 years ago,Visited several times and always disappointing. Hair on the sandwich which I had to remind them of because they forgot my order yet again was the last time I visited. Do not recommend.
45,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really good breakfast at reasonable prices
46,Sarphaat, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Very rude waitress (she literally yelled at me for taking too long to choose a tea), and after asking 3 times for no pine nuts for my girlfriend, she still got her toastie with pine nuts. Food also pretty terrible."
47,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,9 years ago,I love the place. Really friendly. Just aside a park. They could improve by be proactive and vigilant versus the customers. Addendum: don't know is is only today but the internet is so bad...0.11Mbps download and it still cannot tell me the upload. Why they even have it? One step down and is NO internet.. LOL
48,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,5 years ago,It is nice that they have a cat inside :3
49,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Breakfast better this time. First time bagel like to. We had omelette and eggs Benedict both lovely.
50,Sarphaat, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Went for dinner and they were serving until 10:30pm and they were really nice about us arriving at 10:10pm to order food. And the food was good.
51,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Delightful setting across from Sarphati Park.  Wonderful fresh menu....creative and very good.  Helpful, friendly staff......reasonable prices...what more do you need. Great Place !!"
52,Sarphaat, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Location is good but the service and food considerably below average, even by Dutch standards... Needs to work on this."
53,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,a year ago,I love Caf√© Sarphaat. The food is the best and the people there are very Niceüëäüëç
54,Sarphaat, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Be prepared to wait at least 40 minutes for your OK food to arrive. It's hard to get the staff's attention and they seem to have little common knowledge on waiting tables.
55,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice little cafe next to the park. With a great variet of drinks
56,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A cafe that‚Äôs been in the Pijp a long time. Nice area to sit by the park outside. Friendly service, good for drinks"

63,Sarphaat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely smoked salmon and even better coffee! Best of all was the friendly staff :D
64,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food and drinks are good, staff is nice. Location is great: in the very heart of de Pijp in front of the park"
65,Sarphaat, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Pleasant place to while away some time by the park. Food was good, atmospheric surroundings,  but service was slow, made worse by the fact that we arrived starving."
