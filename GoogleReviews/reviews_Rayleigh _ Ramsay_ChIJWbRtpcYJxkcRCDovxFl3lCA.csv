0,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Our first restaurant and bar after the lockdown and so so happy we stopped by. Even with its 100+ selection of wines they make the process easy to Uber tans and fun, or just have a nice cold beer. The menu (for Amsterdam) is surprisingly fresh and unique. I‚Äôll def be back again and again."

4,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"(Translated by Google) Trendy wine bar. However, you can also drink coffee. The highlight of the restaurant is that you can not only choose your wine with a chip card but also fill your glass yourself. ‚Ä¶"
5,Rayleigh & Ramsay, 2 stars ,7 months ago,(Translated by Google) Wide choice of good wines but service was not good. Difficult to approach to order food. Especially self-service. For these high prices you expect more quality and service. ‚Ä¶
