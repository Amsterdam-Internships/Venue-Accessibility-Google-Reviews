0,De Balie, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"First time visit in December 2021 during the 3rd lockdown. Friendly staff and nice ambiance. Enjoyable visit, it is located in the center of the city. (Within walking distance to many restaurants and shopping streets)."
1,De Balie, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very beautiful and particular restaurant, design is nice and pleasant. Personnel is very gentle, the only flaw is the slow service, meals took about 25 mins to be prepared nevertheless, the eggplant and pea cream sandwich was delicious, and ‚Ä¶"
2,De Balie, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Coffee is good, but they really need to change the entire food menu before calling themselves a restaurant. Weirdest combinations that make no sense and taste horrible. Service was also bad, needed to remind them we ordered some food after a while. Will not eat there again."
3,De Balie, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice place to be. We ate lunch and it was delicious. However, the first set of knives was not sharp enough to cut the bread after getting steak knives it was a walk in the Park. Recommendation"
4,De Balie, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Arrogant stuff, at least today for breakfast. Maybe someone should remind them why they have a job. We finished our coffee and ready to go, before we got our smoothie and still it wasn't very crowded. Won't visit them again!"
5,De Balie, 1 star ,2 months ago,Untrustworthy and populist ‚Äòcultural‚Äô organization. Avoid at all costs. Ridiculous governance. Spread fake news about corona and taint very credible people. Corona is not a joke and should be taken seriously.
6,De Balie, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Seriously gone down hill recently, extremely rude staff discriminating against other customers, very expensive, not worth the hassle. Far better options in the area. Won't be missed."
7,De Balie, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food and prices, but the service was extremely slow, although the place wasn't crowded at all."
8,De Balie, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Rude staff! Horrible experience, I was discriminated against. Save your money & go somewhere else that you‚Äôre appreciated! Worse place ever!"
9,De Balie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Our waitress was really nice so the service was good, they had vegan options and non vegan so all my group had something to be happy with, the food was good and the ambient was also nice!"

13,De Balie, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy cafe, nice staff

18,De Balie, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent place to have food. The service that evening was ok. The trouble we went through just to give them the money for food was a little too much. I assume it is not a regular thing, just one of those days. Otherwise, all was good."

22,De Balie, 1 star ,3 years ago,"For the restaurant: Food options are limited and low quality, especially given the prices. Service is slow and wait staff is apathetic at the best of times and rude at the worst of times. If you're in the area and hungry there are so many better options. Have given it more than one chance and never again."
