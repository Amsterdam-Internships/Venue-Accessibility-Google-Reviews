0,Anmol, 5 stars ,a month ago,"This place is excellent. Everything we ordered was delicious. My favorites were the meat samosa, the chicken madras and the naan. The naan here is big and fluffy. I have not seen naan like this at other Indian restaurants in the area. Definitely highly recommend."
1,Anmol, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Exquisite experience.  We got the veggie app platter and each piece was unique and delicious, the naan is consistently delicious.  We also got the paneer tikka masala and the regional pancake , each one amazing . …"
2,Anmol, 4 stars ,a week ago,"I've only ever been to the bar side of the restaurant, but I'm sure the food's the same no matter which side you walk in on. Food? Fantastic!!! Start with an Anmol platter and then finish with the chicken Korma. Atmosphere at the bar is OK. …"
3,Anmol, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"OMG!  The food here is awesome 👌 😋!!! First time here for lunch,  the place looks a little bit outdated but plenty of tables. The  waiter looked properly dressed as a real waiter in uniform, distinct & elegant. Appetizers were very …"

Great place to enjoy delicious Indian food, a good cocktail and pleasant conversation. So happy to see them opening back up for dine in! Can I put more than 5 stars somehow??"
5,Anmol, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Service wasn't good. We saw our waiter twice in the hour and a half we were there. Not a busy night, either. Just left the cash for our drinks and left. We didn't order food, so I won't review it. Ive had their food before, though, and enjoyed it."

to visit. I must say - All Food was flavorful and delicious! We tried Aloo …"
9,Anmol, 3 stars ,2 months ago,Cute place but I've had better food in other restaurant. Small portion of butter chicken and chicken masala but great flavor. Garlic Naan is great and mango lassi.
10,Anmol, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Delicious Indian cuisine! I wasn’t originally a fan of Indian cooking but this place has made me see the light! I could drink that tikka Marsala sauce and the garlic naan is outrageous. The waitstaff and manager are super nice and helpful too.
11,Anmol, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"My first time trying Indian cuisine and it was so good! I even paid them another visit the same week! We went during lunch time, and I’m not sure if rice was included with each curry but we ordered 2 Chicken Tikka Masala and only received 1 …"
12,Anmol, 1 star ,3 months ago,Well a lot of review says the tip customer give doesnt go to the employee at the end of the day which is really sad. Makes me think what kind of situation employee must be going through everyday working their shift inside this terribly …
13,Anmol, 1 star ,4 months ago,"We ordered some dish like dosa(DON'T TRY), paneer and lamb rogen the taste was not as we have thought of. Specially my wife and my brother in law wife didn't like the taste of food. Me and my brother in law managed to finish the food as we …"
14,Anmol, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Excellent vegetable samosas as an appetizer. Cauliflower, eggplant, delicious garlic naam, marsala tea for dinner. Nice friendly staff. Really clean restaurant. Will go back again."
15,Anmol, 2 stars ,3 months ago,Curries didn't seem to have much flavor. I think passage to India does a better job with spices and everything overall.

17,Anmol, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great food - i lived in that part of the world for 5 years

29,Anmol, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious Indian food right in downtown Beverly. A couple favorites are their Aloo Tikki Chaat and the Chicken Korma. Haven't had a chance to dine in because of the pandemic, but gotten takeout multiple times and the food is always delicious!"
30,Anmol, 3 stars ,3 months ago,It's an okayish place to dine in. The service isn't as good as you'd expect.
31,Anmol, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Vegetarian dishes were good. We got the chicken jalfrezi and the chicken was overcooked. The 5 star is for being the only restaurant close to M by the sea and their veg dishes were good.
32,Anmol, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Anmol is great. The food is different than the Indian restaurant in Salem, probably a regional thing. I really like the food at both places.
I've been going here for years, mostly for karaoke. In 2011 I wrote a Yelp …"
33,Anmol, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've tried Indian food a couple times and was greatly disappointed. I gave up on Indian cuisine. Until I tried Anmol. Very polite staff, great assortment of spirits, including some Indian brews. The food had me coming back the next day. I'm …"
34,Anmol, 5 stars ,5 months ago,We consider Anmol to have the best Indian food on the North Shore.
35,Anmol, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The primary Audience this Restaurant targets are Non-Indians.
They have modified the taste to suite them. …"

39,Anmol, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I have had Indian food all over the country and this is by far my absolute favorite. Bobby the owner is a stand up guy. Everything just tastes SO RIGHT! Definitely one of my top visited restaurants that I go to. I’ve never been disappointed.
40,Anmol, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best Indian food on the Northshore, hands down. Atmosphere is warm and comfy. You'll always see familiar faces, but service can be hit or miss. I reccomend take-out for an always consistent experience!"
41,Anmol, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"There's nothing better than deciding to go here for lunch when you know the ride home is a traffic jam.
Deciding it was better to enjoy chicken marsala with jasmine rice than to sit in …"

43,Anmol, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Great place to buy food when in a rush. Their customer service is efficient, prices are affordable, great ambience. Will visit here again"
44,Anmol, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I go here probably once every two weeks. The food is very fresh. The snap is very friendly and you can tell that there is effort put into each dish. It goes from mild to hunt on spice levels and they asked you before you place an order. Do not be afraid to order here even if you do not like spicy.
45,Anmol, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Good atmosphere, great curry, fantastic apps, honestly just everything was a good experience!"
46,Anmol, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good service and flavorful Indian dishes. Get the garlic naan and mango lamb/chicken. Meat has been on the dry side before but it hasn't deterred me from going back to try new entrees. Interesting place. Eat at the bar for a casual or quick …
47,Anmol, 5 stars ,6 years ago,This is by far the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to in the country. Absolutely delicious and authentic. The server was so nice and courteous. The place is neat and well organized. Their naan bread - you have to try this. It was made …
48,Anmol, 5 stars ,a year ago,The mango chicken is my favorite thing on the menu here. Also their garlic naan bread is incredible. Great prices and quick take out service.
49,Anmol, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious authentic Indian food. My wife, coworkers and I LOVE this place! I personally love the Chicken Korma, but there are so many others that are good. The service can be a little slow at lunch, so get there early and enjoy!!!"
50,Anmol, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Really delicious. Ordered some of the staples and was not disappointed.
Will definitely order from them again."
51,Anmol, 5 stars ,2 years ago,So delicious and everyone who works there is super nice.  Their dal soup is scrumptious and they have excellent vegetarian options. It has a really cozy atmosphere too. Great for dining in it take out.
52,Anmol, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Best Indian I’ve ever had.
53,Anmol, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Awesome dinner... samosa, naan.....the entire meal was tremendous.  ONLY issue could be the parking, but it is not so horrible as to lose any portion of a star"
54,Anmol, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Really Excellent. Everything was first class Indian food.
55,Anmol, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I honestly wish I liked this place. It's the closest in proximity to where I live. I've tried it 4 times, and each time I'm bummed that I wasted my money. Its food is mediocre. I've been to a ton of Indian restaurants and this is one that …"
56,Anmol, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Several veg curries and pakora for takeout. The spicy dish was properly spicy and medium dish properly medium. Yum.
57,Anmol, 5 stars ,a year ago,The best place to eat authentic Indian food!  I love their entire menu.  The staff are courteous & friendly.
58,Anmol, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great indian food with some southern indian specials. Only issue I had was dishes being brought out at weird times. Had my appetizer brought out at end of meal and had to remind server twice about Naan. Not issues that make much of a difference as the food was excellent.
59,Anmol, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely my favorite Indian restaurant. They take the time to prepare the food so well and it's always a fun time to play Keno, drink a few beers and eat the most delicious Indian food anywhere. Highly recommend the chicken tikka masala, …"
60,Anmol, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place with great Indian food.

Paneer Tikka Masala is very good. My favorite dish and this Restaurant makes it …"
61,Anmol, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to hangout with family with delicious Indian food. But one negative is time, they will take 20 minutes to prepare your order some time more than that. You should have lots of patience to be here. Food no doubt this is best in this area. thanks"
62,Anmol, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Have to say, pretty surprised at the quality of indian food. Great food, had a variety of pakora, and the food was actually spicy. Almost as good as punjabi dhaba in boston, and has the advantage of parking, seating, and they take credit card. Service and food were fast too. Ill have to come back :)"
63,Anmol, 5 stars ,10 years ago,Simply the best Indian food that I have had on the North Shore. The service is great and the prices are spot on. They have a wonderful bar that becomes pretty busy on the weekend evenings with karaoke. Trying the mango ice cream is a must!
64,Anmol, 5 stars ,3 years ago,They provide quick pick up service. Their spices taste very fresh. The #1 Indian restaurant for me in Beverly. Their interior needs a little updating. Staff is very kind.
65,Anmol, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Popular with the locals, Ammol  is a family run Indian restaurant conveniently located near the commuter rail station.  It is divided into bar and dining section.  I've only been to the bar, which is a surreal mix of Indian cuisine, …"
66,Anmol, 4 stars ,3 years ago,This is my favorite Indian food in the area (albeit there are not many options;). These guys do a great job providing authentic Indian cuisine for the North Shore. They also deliver which is a huge bonus. My favorite dishes are the aloo gobi and palak paneer. Love their pappadums! Tasty!
67,Anmol, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Pros:

We were refused a pitcher of water to start and they came once to refill our glasses which was no where near enough. The major issue i have is that my food …"
72,Anmol, 3 stars ,6 years ago,We always get Indian takeout from Anmol because it's the best Indian in the area.  Unfortunately their delivery consistency is pretty horrible. The people handing off the food to the (sub-contracted) delivery person often misses part of the …
73,Anmol, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great service prices and food as usual! We drive 20 min to come here because there insnt another place that is better in the Indian food department. Their Naan bread is outstanding.
74,Anmol, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Loved the paneer tikka masala.Quantity was huge
75,Anmol, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"If I could only choose one restaurant to eat at for the rest of my life, this would be it.  This little hole in the wall is home to the best Indian food I have ever had (and I have had LOTS of Indian food). …"
76,Anmol, 2 stars ,9 years ago,"The food here was somewhat of a disgrace to REAL Indian food. It literally took an hour for our food to come to our tabel, and by then we just wanted to leave. For a good hour we ate all of our ""tortilla"" chips with the table spices. Once I …"
77,Anmol, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place.. Everything was just perfect. Especially the garlic naan- it was the best I have ever tasted, kind of like khameeri roti. Paneer korma gravy wqs superb. I was little disappointed by the tea but overall it was great."
78,Anmol, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best Indian food in the area. Only had the take out but its consistently awesome. If you like Indian check this place out. Very good.
79,Anmol, 5 stars ,a year ago,Simply amazing everytime I go. Best Indian food in the area by a long shot.
80,Anmol, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very bad and stale food. Made me sick. That too when I just ordered Daal and Roti nothing fancy.
Tastes no where close to good Indian food. Disgrace to have such a restaurant …"
81,Anmol, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Anmol is the best Indian food on the North Shore, and perhaps even better than what you can find in Boston. The wait staff are all extremely kind, quick, and the food will blow your taste buds' minds! Garlic naan and any of the Tikka Masalas are a great combo."
82,Anmol, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Anmol has the freshest ingredients and traditional Indian food. The service is great and friendly. Highly recommended. It is also very reasonable and a nice quiet atmosphere.
83,Anmol, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food, super nice and friendly, they made sure I was taken care of even though they were super busy and I was just grabbing a to go order. When the wait lasted more than 5 min they apologized and offered me a seat at the bar, I didn't mind the wait at all- they were slammed and the food was worth it!"
84,Anmol, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very poor experience. We called and booked a table yet we had to wait. Was then made to wait for 15mins to place our order with poor customer service. Clearly the saff aren't trained at all. Then we had to wait for another 36mins for our …
85,Anmol, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent Indian food, they do standards like Tikka Masala and Vindaloo very well. Service can be painfully slow, especially when they get busy, but it's worth enduring it for great food."
86,Anmol, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We have been at Anmol many time. We feel at advantage that Anmol is in Beverly and we donot have to go mikes away for a Indian Restaurant. Food is consistenly same and good. Many of our American friends have been with us and repeatdly gone on their own. Best Food.
87,Anmol, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food was mediocre, quantity of food was way too little.  The owner and cook is from Nepal, no wonder the food didn’t taste like Indian food at all, it’s totally not worth it.  Most of the reviews here are probably by the restaurant staff."
88,Anmol, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food and service were beyond my expectations. We absolutely loved the atmosphere of this spot. Great spot to take my family out for dinner.
89,Anmol, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Food is made to order depending on how spicy you like it.  I love their chicken tikka masala and mango lassis.  My husband loves the spicier chicken dishes.  Vegetable byriani is also very good.
90,Anmol, 5 stars ,a year ago,Excellent food! Tried a new bread everytime and each of them are great. Try the Gulab Jamun desert as well
91,Anmol, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Literally the best food you'll ever eat. No lie. My fiance and I would eat it everyday if we could. In fact we want them to cater our wedding. That's how good they are.
92,Anmol, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"best indian food on the north shore. excellent vegetarian variety. lush braised meats. my S.O. eats the lamb jalfrezi like once a week. i'm a bit worried. try the bhel, it's a sweet, tangy, salad of puffed rice, onion, and tomato tossed in …"
93,Anmol, 5 stars ,2 years ago,If you love Indian food this is the best I've had locally! Out of the way but definitely worth it!!
94,Anmol, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Very good food, friendly staff. Can't wait till they open fully"
95,Anmol, 5 stars ,a year ago,Had the Dal Soup and the Lamb Saag and both were amazing. I am thrilled I live down the street because I will be back!
96,Anmol, 1 star ,2 years ago,We arrived when there was no one else in the restaurant. The servers didn’t just show up.. and we left without ordering or eating. The service staff was busy discussing more important things!!!
97,Anmol, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Didn't like the naan but other than that everything was excellent and tasty and so good. I'm very picky where naan is concerned so don't just rely on me for that. However the chicken tikka masala I had was out of this world!!!
98,Anmol, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Close to 30 minutes in the restaurant, and the attitude of the restaurant staff is so sick and arrogant. Looks like the staff don't like desis at all. It just feels sick that we come here with hope just to be insulted. Horrible experience. Will never come again!"
99,Anmol, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best Indian food in the Boston area.
100,Anmol, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great place.. Menu had some good selection of Indian food.. Friendly staff.. Food tasted good but not the best.

102,Anmol, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great food, really enjoyed it"
103,Anmol, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I've dined at many Indian restaurants across the US; Anmol is my favorite by far. The chicken makhni is amazing as is the samosa chaat!
104,Anmol, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I have never been disappointed with Anmol. The food and drinks are both great quality! Karaoke is fun here too!
105,Anmol, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best Indian food in town. I always get the fixed grill and my girlfriend gets the vindaloo. We are never disappointed.

109,Anmol, 5 stars ,4 months ago,I looked this place a lot. Got the lamb saag
110,Anmol, 3 stars ,2 years ago,sub standard food and service. Dosa tasted poor. Biryani was ok. Naan was really good. sub par indian restaurant. Id spend my money elsewhere.
111,Anmol, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious food, got extra rice. 4 stars because staff is seemingly indifferent in emotion it felt. Great place, would recommend"

115,Anmol, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, clean kitchen, price is reasonable, owner is a good man. What more need to be said. Tika Massala is the best in New England!!!"
116,Anmol, 3 stars ,10 years ago,"The food was actually quite good, the service friendly and timely, but the decor and atmosphere was terrible. I felt like I was in some strange time portal to a dingy pub in the 90s (which I actually think used to be in that space). Will definitely do take out from there, though."
117,Anmol, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely my favorite restaurant, period! Best food, amazingly friendly staff, quiet, seriously; the best food. Go at all given chances! Haha"
118,Anmol, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good Indian food, restaurant could use a little updating, but good Indian food with reasonable prices and decent drinks."

129,Anmol, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Naan bread was great tasting. Chicken in the saag was a little overcooked. Overall good and I would try again.
130,Anmol, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Pleasant service. Traffic for take away counter streams through the middle of the restaurant which is why I deducted a star. Food was good.
