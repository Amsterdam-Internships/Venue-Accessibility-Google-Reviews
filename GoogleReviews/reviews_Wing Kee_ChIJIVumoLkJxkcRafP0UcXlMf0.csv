1,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"It‚Äôs a classic Cantonese restaurant. The atmosphere is authentic(but a little bit out, or old fashion), the place is clean, service efficient. The food is normal, but the quality is still among those best outside China."
2,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Nobody can beat  the best of the best :-) they cook the most traditional Chinese food, place is not fashionable at all, at the contrary. But service is excellent and food is amazing"
3,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Really Chinese food here.  The shrimp dumpling soup is very good and we almost forgot to take the photo. Thanks for the good food and friendly service.

10,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This place cured our cravings, pretty very authentic to home cooked Chinese food. Love their mapo tofu, the spiciness  made us go for a few more rounds rice. Their roasted porks are decent but pretty thick cutlets."
11,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing Chinese food, crowded with couples, friends and just near the red light district. Shows the popularity of the place. Service is quick, duck meat and noodles are superb. Don't miss the complimentary jasmine tea which is served in a tea pot"

21,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I used to eat here regularly when I lived in the neighbourhood, it's a family eatery in the Chinese district, might be packed with tourists but not the typical touristy place. No alcohol and they take only cash (maybe recently changed ‚Ä¶"
22,Wing Kee, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"To be honest I‚Äôm really disappointed. The chasiu is chewy af and roast pork had way too much fat.
In the end we had our vegi to go. And the waitress put the vegi in a box without secure the lid. And it spilled everywhere. Are you kidding me??
Don‚Äôt recommend."
23,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Good food, good price. I pretty much grow up on their food. Been a customer for a long long time."
24,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome food, you should really go there for the asian BBQ, like the cha sieuw pork or the peking duck. It is very cheap and you really can't get it anywhere else. They make all their meats themselves and the dishes are really authentic ‚Ä¶"

28,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had the roast meat combination mix and stir fried beef noodles. Both were great. Roast were flavourful and nicely done. Beef noodles had the wok fragrance and noodles were springy. ‚Ä¶

32,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I am from Hong Kong, and after few months spending in UK, I have come to Holland and walk pass this, and went in to try the beef noodle.

42,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,100% authentic Cantonese this is where the local Chinese eat. Not a tourist trap. Very economic too.
43,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,a year ago,"We came here for Peking duck and ordered it in two variations: regular and a chef dish (with rice paper, greens and hoisin sauce). The regular one was ok but too fatty for my taste, however, the chef one was just amazing! In case I crave Peking duck again I will definitely come for the chef dish!"
44,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Food was good price ok, unfortunately the Kung po, Kung pao.... Was westernised, big chunks, without szechuan pepper and mild.
Everything ealse was good!"
45,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Solid Chinese food. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much coming to a foreign country that has Chinese food but this was very on par with the authentic Chinese food I had in the states and in Hong Kong. The staff were friendly and very attentive. The ‚Ä¶

60,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We decided on this restaurant because we saw lots of Chinese people eating there.  We figured it must be authentic. Enjoyed the food especially the wanton noodles and the siew yok (roast pork), as we have been away from home for two weeks and were missing our Chinese Home cooked food."
61,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Food is cheap and heel lekker! Will be back for more.
62,Wing Kee, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Not a single vegetarian dish on the menu!There is a section ‚Äòbean curd dishes‚Äô on the menu, where only bean curd dishes with meat are listed. It‚Äôs the 21st century, wake up!"
63,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This  place literally haven't changed for 15 years. Same menu. Some of which is adapted to European paletts.  Some of which is really good. I had the pork belly and soy chicken this time they were a bit dry unfortunately.  I'ts a large restaurant, and an oasis of calm (but not good design) in the Red Light/china town area."
64,Wing Kee, 1 star ,2 years ago,"As someone who has eaten Chinese food their entire life. Please do not come here and expect genuine Chinese food. Everything we ordered was salty, overcooked, and a horrible lazy imitation of what it should taste like. The bbq duck is not ‚Ä¶"
65,Wing Kee, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The service was nice, the waiters almost spoke English, the meal size was big and it was served fast. Now for the bad: the food was almost cold, the duck was poorly cleaned, the pork was crispy enough to cut glass. Two stars only because of the best worker of this place -- the cat with a dead mouse strolling around the place."
66,Wing Kee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"As a native Hongkonger, I wouldn't rate it very high. The roasted duck was quite nice and authentic, but the roasted pork belly was not satisfying at all.
The roasted pork belly was sliced into very small pieces and doesn't have a the ‚Ä¶"
67,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Authentic Hong Kong place. The food is good, the service is quick and efficient, the interior clean and not cozy. But you don't come for the romantic setting, you come for the food! I'm Chinese and my family *always* come here when in town. For the vegans: ask them to make tofu in sweet and sour sauce - so good."
68,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best chinese restaurant I ve ever been, no bs, no waste of time straight to order, tea and rice are included and the service is always on point.
Often packed but the place is big enough, lunch is the mist crowded time, the ‚Ä¶"
69,Wing Kee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"For the food , 3.5 stars is the most . Service is very interesting, Cash only if you are tourist and non-cantonese speaker . They have POS machine and it works perfectly, but the staff only let specific customers to use their credit card."
70,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I ate here by myself so couldn't order much.  I had the mapo tofu (which is always my go to dish) and it felt like I was back in shanghai again. The flavours and spiciness was so spot on. So glad I found this place. All the staff were ‚Ä¶
71,Wing Kee, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Was a bit disappointed with the quality of the roast duck and roast pork. As an international tourist, I find the taste is a bit below par for a good Chinese roast meat restaurant. Place is clean but looks like it's not been renovated at all since the 70s.  A plate of roast duck/roast pork mix rice costs about ‚Ç¨10."
72,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Authentic Chinese food. Love it
73,Wing Kee, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible experience.
Sabotaged my water bottle making me soaking!
Duck was 90% bone and covered in black rotting flesh. No value for money! ‚Ä¶"
74,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Unassuming looking restaurant with authentic Chinese fare! Had the wonton and roasted meat noodles. Super big portion for one bowl, 2 pax can actually share one bowl!"
75,Wing Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The food is just normal, but the attitude of service is garbage, I order the vegetarian food but they send beef and vegetable, and they let us to accept this mistake with extremely bad voice attitude. What if I cannot eat meat today? ‚Ä¶"
76,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Selection of Chinese food is overwhelming, but drinks menu petite. Interior not great, feels like a school cafeteria in a way. There was also dead ducks hanging next to our table so not for the weak stomached. Service was good, extremely fast to serve the food. Somewhat overpriced."
77,Wing Kee, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"We were disappointed with this place. First of all the staff seemed not really organized and was really unfriendly (the waitress did not respond properly, no smile, we didn't feel welcome). The other staff member was friendly at least and ‚Ä¶"
78,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This is the place to be on a lazy sunday afternoon. Ask for the crunchy pork meat barbeque or the tasty prawn filled fried taofu. Mix that with steaming lukewarm white rice and a splash of chinese chilli sauce. Too bad that they do not serve beers, which would make the experience perfect."
79,Wing Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,If your wanting a tasty chineise meal do not enter this awful place. Not only is the service abismal but the food is indebile.  They actually attempted to serve up a plate of rice that was obviously burnt. The staff here actually go out ‚Ä¶

Makes me think of my fond memories traveling in Asia"

89,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, good food. Duck is delicious"
90,Wing Kee, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The decor was nice, but I expected more from the Peking duck which contained a lot of tough pieces and bits of bone to spit out again. The service's limited English also made communication a hassle."
91,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Soft duck with Hoi sin sauce and pancakes, stir fried vegetables with prawns both delicious. Not the cheapest, but great food."
92,Wing Kee, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Duck soup was good, but service was lacking.  When I asked to pay by credit card, I was told only locals can pay that way - and I'd JUST seen them let 5 boys from China pay by credit card."
93,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I‚Äôm from Singapore. Really good beef noodle soup and char siew siew yok. Really a godsend after 3 weeks in Europe. Expect authentic hongkong service and attitude too! Lol

98,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Probably one of my most favourite places to eat in Amsterdam. It's cheap, the service is great and most dishes are quite as good as you would get in eateries in Hong Kong. My favourite dishes are the wontons in Cheung Fan (flat rice noodles) and the cha siu fan."
99,Wing Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This has got to be the best HK-style restaurants I‚Äôve been to in Europe. The beef brisket and roast duck were particularly good.
100,Wing Kee, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was OK, but not what I expected from a restaurant like this.
The service was terrible and the waitress that served me was completely lacking in manners and any kind of gratitude. ‚Ä¶"

107,Wing Kee, 1 star ,5 years ago,"poor service,we got a table,but hostes don't asked what would we drink? or just to offer glas water for us. And when we used  a WC,and then wanna left a restaurant,  one agresive man, ( manager or hostes from this place) getting ""teaching"" ‚Ä¶"

111,Wing Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly service. Food is good. Environment is not so modern. Still very pleasant to dine in.
112,Wing Kee, 1 star ,4 years ago,15 minutes after seating and still no one came to take even an order of drinks whilst other parties that arrived after were being served before us. It's finally when I got up to leave that a server came to us trying to block our exit and gesturing that she will now take our order. Took my money and business elsewhere! Such a shame...
