0,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicious food, great service, and great drinks. I would say you would find more snacks than meals (as the name implies). The staff is highly personable, and they had great recommendations. The cocktails are well-balanced, and I love that ‚Ä¶"
1,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,a month ago,"It just feels right! This place is all about inclusivity meaning they have something for everyone. Introvert/extrovert, drink/don't drink, vegan/carnivore it's great. Great staff and owners. It puts the fun in funky. Also they have a bomb locally made michelada."
2,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,a month ago,"I can't remember a better service experience at an Austin restaurant or bar in ages!  It was a cold night and we sat outside but the fire pit, blankets and heating pad made it very comfortable.  The staff made sure we had everything we needed.  The snacks and cocktails were great, too."
3,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Bobo‚Äôs is a delight. The playful and welcoming atmosphere are matched by the eclectic and delicious menu. Definitely get the Chana masala empanadas and the vegan queso. We felt so at home that we stayed to play games and drink another Glenn ‚Ä¶
4,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Cute experience and good drinks. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend the pizza, pretty sure it‚Äôs frozen and reheated so it‚Äôs not worth 17$. Edamame hummus was great. Good atmosphere and the owners were super sweet. Will definitely go back but be more picky with what food to get."
5,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"This is such an awesome place to hang out! Great beverage selection with local and Texan products üçª, cool patio, and a super friendly staff. It's got all the right things, gotta love that!"
6,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Delicious food, wonderful atmosphere and super friendly awesome staff. We had a young bird crash into the window behind where we were sitting and Sarah was so quick to grab a box and gloves when I asked. However after a few minutes of being ‚Ä¶"
7,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,a month ago,"We love heading over to Bobos day or night for snacks (wonderful selection of healthy, local items) and drinks (usually we enjoy a bottle or 2 of local wine) in a relaxed backyard environment. It‚Äôs conveniently located near Mueller, so ‚Ä¶"
8,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"I went to Bobo‚Äôs Snack Bar for the first time last night. I really enjoyed my experience. It has a relaxed vibe, with a charming, mid-century inspired ambiance. The staff was very friendly and attentive, and the locally sourced food and ‚Ä¶"

Small, intimate and fun.  COVID limits how much interaction you can have with staff or being in the small inside, but they have embraced that.  Connect to the ‚Ä¶"
12,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Bobo‚Äôs is an amazing bar/ resturant. Their drinks are great and so is the food. Their staff is so friendly and they are being smart about how to deal with Covid. The outdoor seating is comfortable and a great place to sit and chat with ‚Ä¶
13,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Not often you find a snack bar named after a cat and a snack bar back in my hometown Amsterdam. We came with the puppy we are house sitting for and the staff was incredibly kind to him. We very much enjoyed our drinks and snacks there. ‚Ä¶
14,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I highly recommend this new place in town, one of the best hidden gems you will find while in Austin. Menu options are awesome, whether you‚Äôre planning a full meal or just a snack. Service is outstanding and the decoration will transport you to somewhere in between 1950 and 1970!"
15,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"The food and drinks are fantastic, chill patio and beautiful interior. Great neighborhood spot!"

29,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"This place is very cool, the staff is awesome! I have been twice and love hanging out at the bar talking to the bartenders and waitstaff. They are friendly and best of all, they know their beer and wine. I have not ordered food there yet, ‚Ä¶"
30,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"For a recent girls' night, we went to Snack Bar and were both surprised. We shared a few dishes and enjoyed a couple cocktails. They don't have a huge menu but the few items we tried were good. The pate and chevre plates were delicious. I ‚Ä¶"
31,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,My favorite restaurant on South Congress. Their BLT is great and their mimosas are pretty large compared to the standard mimosa size. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The patio is dog friendly. Try to get there early before it gets busy.
32,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"I love the food at Snack Bar - not only do they offer gluten free options but it's local and much of it is organic!  How many restaurants in Austin do that?!   Plus, the outdoor patio is fantastic despite the fact that Congress Ave. is ‚Ä¶"
33,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"I came here, not expecting much. It's a snack bar, I didn't expect greatness. I loved the french toast. Damn it, it was deceivingly good, and that bean dip was madness. Fries weren't that good, but not bad, but in general the food was very ‚Ä¶"
34,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,11 years ago,"Everyone I take here becomes immediately as obsessed with it as I am. Their breakfast is divine and almost everything we've tried at lunch has been GREAT! My friend loved the Quinoa dish, and I loved the Asian style egg dish (Japanese name) ‚Ä¶"

36,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"If i could give 6 stars I absolutely would. Snack Bar rocks my world. The service and the staff are amazing and friendly, the food is incredible, the decor is adorable, the patio is awesome, and dog friendly. They have a great brunch, happy hour and live music in the evenings. I would ( and have ) recommend snack bar for any occasion!"
37,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Snack Bar still feels like a restaurant with lots of potential that it hasn't reached yet. The menu is lovely, really truly, but it still feels like a work in progress. The wines could be a buck cheaper across the board, especially since ‚Ä¶"
38,Snackbar Bobo, 3 stars ,7 years ago,I came here for drinks with a large party after a wedding rehearsal. The one big pro was our ability to take over their couch/waiting area in front of the bar. We all had a seat and could easily chat with one another (plus direct access to ‚Ä¶
39,Snackbar Bobo, 2 stars ,7 years ago,This place is on South Congress and the atmosphere is quite posh. We came here for brunch and I was kind of disappointed with the lack of choices on the menu.  My girlfriend had the salmon bagel with cream cheese.  It was delicious. I had a ‚Ä¶
40,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I've only been here for brunch, but the salmon bagel (Rockstar Bagel) this place serves is one of my favorite brunch items of all time. Incredibly fresh ingredients, staff is friendly and the patio is very nice. Only minor complaint is that the service is slower than usual the both times I've visited."
41,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The new Bobo's Snack Bar on Airport is such a gem, everyone should check it out!  Great company, Great food, Great drinks, Great atmosphere!"
42,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Only visited briefly for a drink after walking past a few times. Great vibe, friendly staff. Will come back to eat when I next visit."
43,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,10 years ago,"They had some issues when they first opened, which kept me away for a long time. ‚Ä¶"
44,Snackbar Bobo, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"We had weekend brunch at Snack Bar in May during a visit from Seattle. The atmosphere was great, but on the whole, the food was nothing special. We had unimpressive bloody marys and bacon that came out burnt to start (I like a bacon ‚Ä¶"
45,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,3 hours ago,"Great place for afternoon meeting with friends.  Very friendly staff, good drink options and tasty snack options."
46,Snackbar Bobo, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"A slightly newer South Congress staple for locals and tourists. Friendly service, though they seem to get overwhelmed easily. If it's busy plan to wait. Food is good but fairly expensive for what it is. I guess I'm still sore from dropping ‚Ä¶"
47,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,8 years ago,If looking for a place uses local ingredients with great flare then the Snack Bar is a great choice! The food is always fresh and the waitstaff is great. do yourself a favor and take advantage of one the best Happy hours in Town!
48,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,10 years ago,"The Snack Bar is owned and operated by a truly involved lady. Her contact information is on every table, should you have comments or suggestions. The aesthetic is *perfect* for the space and the food is excellent. Many gluten free items and 'tea cocktails' and lots of local products."
49,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"I recently stopped here with a group of friends during SxSW. We were seated on the patio so we were able to listen to live bands playing in the parking lot. While we were there, we enjoyed Shady's, fruity punches and delicious burgers. The ‚Ä¶"
50,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"When my husband & I first sat down and started reviewing their menu we were a little disappointed & not overly sure we wanted to stay, sooooo happy we did! =)  We sat at the bar and ordered a couple of drinks and two appetizers to share and ‚Ä¶"
51,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Went to Snack Bar for Happy Hour recently, since it goes until 7.  Food selection is okay, but I really like the MYSTERY WINE option at happy hour.  It's cheap, and fun to get a glass of whatever they have on hand.  I got to try something that I probably wouldn't have otherwise, and for a great price."
52,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Good time with friends. Hospitable staff. Homegrown eatery.
53,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Cool vibe, modern stylish interior decor, small intimate space. Great fresh local-sourced food. Good customer service. Fairly priced for the quality of food and service. I'll definitely stop by again next time I'm in ATX."
54,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,9 years ago,this place is awesome! the menu is diverse and yummy - lots of veggie options - and they always seem to be running some sort of special or happy hour on food and drinks. really cute setting. a nice choice if you're parading up and down south congress.
55,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"DOG FRIENDLY RESTAURANT!!! 2 THUMBS UP!!!

56,Snackbar Bobo, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"I have been there twice, and both times the service has been horrendous. The first time around, we were a group of 10, and they were particularly slow in serving. Also, a pleasant demeanour wouldn't hurt. However, I didn't think much of it ‚Ä¶"
57,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,10 years ago,Went here on a food tour and got to try the Tomago Yoko which was excellent.  I was disappointed that it was served with scrambled eggs on top instead of the over-easy egg which is how it would be served if I ordinarily ordered the meal.  The owner was nice and gave us the history of the restaurant and the nearby Austin Motel.
58,Snackbar Bobo, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Recently came back to Snack Bar for the first time in ~year. What was once a solid restaurant has slipped a lot. From our first belated, unhelpful greeting from the hostess to the long wait for the check, nothing clicked on our recent ‚Ä¶"
59,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Great location and outdoor area for people-watching on SoCo. I tried both their goat tostadas and burger. Both were presented well and tasted amazing. They also have a decent beer selection.
60,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Everything about this place was brilliant. The atmosphere drew me in and the amazing service I received from Connor will bring me back any chance I get. The food was outstanding, and I was never in need of a thing. I was well informed about ‚Ä¶"
61,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Excellent...caramelized.Brussel sprouts were outstanding...goat cheese appetizer filling...Texas local brews very nice.  Loacals, families with children and tourists welcomed..came back and chose over all else. ENJOY! !"
62,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,10 years ago,Above-average burgers and well-made entrees with attentive service and a pleasant outdoor environment. I loved how the fries were served in a paper bag (even though they were only lukewarm). Will definitely be back!
63,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,10 years ago,I love Soco and this place! They often have instant groupon deals which always bring me back.  I can't wait to go again.  They biscuits and gravy are good.  The atmosphere is awesome and the food is great.  I totally recommend it if you are ‚Ä¶
64,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Snack Bar has a very cool 50's thing going on with vintage furniture, but a modern wine, beer and tapas menu as well. It's a great spot for people watching on congress and I highly recommend getting an outdoor spot."
65,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Weekend in Austin enjoying the people, drinks and the food.   Great place to drink a pitcher of Mimosas.   The food and the service were top notch.   If i could give them 6 stars i would!"
66,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,10 years ago,I stopped off at Snack Bar during the Austin Eats Food Tour a few weeks back.  The owner Bethany talked to us about how they come up with their unique menu and then served us delicious Tamago Yoko which is something you wouldnt expect to ‚Ä¶
67,Snackbar Bobo, 3 stars ,10 years ago,"Snack Bar just doesn't stand out on a street (SoCo) that boasts some of the best spots in Austin. Food is good, but it's been done before. Space is awkward for a restaurant. Good drink specials."
68,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Lovely experience. Great wine selection and awesome vegan options.
69,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,8 years ago,Snack Bar is a great spot on SoCo. I like that they're open late and sometimes have live music.  I almost always get the same thing when I go: quinoa avocado salad and brussel sprouts.  When I want to sweeten it up I get the lime pomegranate juice.
70,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Well worth the stop. Good appetizers and a great selection of beers and liquors.
71,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"For being called ""Basic Burger,"" it was anything but. SO delicious! The Pompeii Ricotta is a fabulous snack or appetizer, too. Great spot on SoLa, so you can people watch."
72,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,10 years ago,"Great place for a nice date. I went on a Wednesday night and the place was very quite. The menu was very scattered, limited and really had no rhyme or reason.   The good thing is that it takes you out of your comfort zone and encourages you to try new things. The service was nice."
73,Snackbar Bobo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"$13 for a tiny bland vegan burger which is the same price as the meat burger??? Oh yeah and if you want fries its an extra $2 and $4 for a side salad? Pffffft  Also, they advertise as being fresh and organic although they use non organic gmo jet fuel canola oil"
74,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Wonderful neighborhood spot. Really great people!
75,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Superb, casual and fun ambiance at this woman-owned and run establishment I‚Äôll be back soon!"
76,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"The French toast was wonderful, custard-like in the middle and burnt just right on the outside. The vermicelli bowl was refreshing on a hot day. Service was friendly and efficient."
77,Snackbar Bobo, 2 stars ,9 years ago,"Cool location, but they have a habit of running out of food.  I went once on a Thursday and they had ran out of a third of their menu which was extremely annoying.  The food was mediocre.  They had a psychic there though, which was pretty cool."
78,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"With some groovy decor, movies projected inside, a fire pit outside, and wonderful naturally-sourced food, the Snack Bar is a great place to hang out, eat, drink or read any time of year! Try the Brussels Sprouts!"
79,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,8 years ago,This place may be our new favorite place in Austin for brunch. Chef is excellent. All of the food is locally grown and the french toast is D E L I C I O U S!!!
80,Snackbar Bobo, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The service was fair. I had heard of this place from a few tourist that I had met. When I finally went in to try it myself, I was not satisfied at all. The food was not great but just okay, missing flavor. I had tried several items on the ‚Ä¶"
81,Snackbar Bobo, 3 stars ,10 years ago,"I got the SoCo Benny (spinach, salmon, Hollandaise sauce and poached eggs on two buttermilk waffles), which was decent.  Honestly, though, the bites that I couldn't drown in Hollandaise sauce weren't very good, and my eggs were overcooked.  I expect poached eggs to have runny yolks, but these yolks fell asleep at the starting line."
82,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Staff was super friendly and drinks were delicious!!
83,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,10 years ago,"Classy, trendy and inexpensive.  This is a place to take out of towners for a delightful meal, drinks and a stroll along South Congress after indulging in their fabulous eclectic variety of small plates and drink concoctions."
84,Snackbar Bobo, 2 stars ,10 years ago,Blue bib is 5 romaine lettuce leaves drizzled lightly with delicious dressing but definitely not worth $9 for this lack of substance. Eggplant curry is decent.
85,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Cool place, great location, staff is nice. Always busy so plan for a small wait. Unique food but it's not my kind of food and small portion sizes IMO"
86,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Great patio and the snacks are inventive and very good. Only complaint is the beer selection wasn't the best, but it's not called ""beer bar""!"
87,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Love this place and the menu is always on point. I know the manager and she definitely treats the customers right! Always a destination spot when i'm going out to eat in Austin.
88,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,8 years ago,Love dining out on the patio here for brunch on the weekends! Dog friendly patio + Cafe Nutella = a perfect Saturday morning.
89,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Amazing brunch! They love dogs too. Brought out a water bowl and treats for our dog. Will definitely be back!
90,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,10 years ago,"The food here is pretty good, but not extraordinary. I do really like the concept and playful-vibe of Snack Bar, and I recommend the Sangria."
91,Snackbar Bobo, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Average good place to eat with organic options. Outside atmosphere is nice. Good options, minimal but cover most tastes."
92,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Fantastic neighborhood wine bar with best-in-class vegetarian tapas

100,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,9 years ago,This was a really cool place. Great local brews and nice menu selections.  Got to try their award winning Tamago Yoko!
101,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Couldn't ask more from this restaurant.  They really care about customers, and the food is always outstanding (try the rice vermicelli).  When I am passing through Austin, I always have to stop here."

103,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Best brussel sprouts I've ever had!

108,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Vegetarian food was pretty decent, and they were very accommodating with my massive dog."
109,Snackbar Bobo, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I enjoyed food in this place and great service. This restaurant is closed as of OCT 30th,2016. I think South Congress will never be same."
110,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,8 years ago,Good for organic and gluten free. Nice atmosphere. Live music. Portions are small.
111,Snackbar Bobo, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Excellent food, great beer selection and the space is an awesome throwback to how the seventies imagined the future."
112,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Loved the vibe of this place. Food was pretty good. I even ate Thanksgiving dinner here six years ago.

122,Snackbar Bobo, 4 stars ,10 years ago,Who doesn't love snack foods?  Good concept in a good location.
