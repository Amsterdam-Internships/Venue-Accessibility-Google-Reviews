0,Fiko, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"I really like the originality of their pistachio pizza. The only thing is that the dough was too dry for my liking, and the ingredients on the pizza were mostly cold. I don't know if it was similar in my previous visits or if this is the ‚Ä¶"
1,Fiko, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Most delicious place in Amsterdam. I liked the Pizza more as the one in Naples and the sweets were fantastic too. Service was seemingly annoyed by our request to change the table but still tried to act nice. Definitely worth a visit.
2,Fiko, 1 star ,2 months ago,"I put one star because otherwise we would not be able to post the review.

We ordered two lasagnas at 14:00, and they didn't bring them to us until 16:45, ‚Ä¶"
3,Fiko, 5 stars ,6 months ago,We had the margherita and the pistachio pizza. Highly recommend the pistachio pizza. For a side we had the bruschetta. And some dessert. ‚Ä¶
4,Fiko, 5 stars ,a year ago,They recommended me the place for good pizza. Went to have dinner. Loved the place. ‚Ä¶
5,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We went here for dinner, because the Italian colleague of my friend said they make good pizzas here. And I must say that I agree!! ‚Ä¶"
6,Fiko, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"I had my first gluten free pizza and barely could tell the difference! The pistachio pizza was so so delicious! ===== I was so impressed I ordered delivery, turns out it's not as nice üò¢ which is totally understandable! I recommend visiting physically!"
7,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome, good, authentic, delicious... I can't even describe how happy it makes me to go there for dinner whenever I feel homesick.
Both locations are just as great!"
8,Fiko, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Fantastic food and staff were excellent 5 stars !!
9,Fiko, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"By far the best pizza at fiko Amsterdam. Pistachio, burrata and cherry tomatoes on black dough. You really need to give it a try."
10,Fiko, 5 stars ,a week ago,You see only beautiful ladies in that place
11,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Definitely try the pizza with pistachio! After the first bite of the most delicious mozzarella you'll wish you'd ordered the large pizza instead of the combo, but how could you not want to try another pizza if the whole menu sounds amazing? ‚Ä¶"
12,Fiko, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice location, and ingredients.
But a point on food. Having a sandwich with such a fresh Italian ingredients would deserve more than a cold bread dough and consequently a cold sandwich to eat. ‚Ä¶"
13,Fiko, 1 star ,a year ago,I ordered an ortolana and I received this pizza.... why?! Mushroom with pesto!!
14,Fiko, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I visited this place because I read so many good reviews about it. However, I don‚Äôt share the opinion of the others: service was a bit pretentious/arrogant. Pizzas had good ingredientes but they were delivered cold; the gnocchi pasta was ok ‚Ä¶"
15,Fiko, 1 star ,a year ago,"Very small sized pizza for overrated price.
Not coming back.
Quality is ok, but in Amsterdam you eat the same level pizza for much less."
16,Fiko, 1 star ,2 years ago,"First of all they downgraded the menu. They don‚Äôt put as much truffle on the pizza as they used to do. Second, the pizza was cold when they served it. When we made a complaint about it, the waitress looked at us weird and made a weird comment that it seemed like we were lying. Would not recommend this place anymore."
17,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great selection of pizza. You can tell that they use fresh and high quality products! Restaurant has a very cool vibe. We'll go back!
18,Fiko, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Overhyped and overpriced place. The idea of adding fresh ingredients after baking your pizza is nice, but not if the result is serving them cold. Selling Nespresso as an espresso is an insult."
19,Fiko, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Gluten free pizzas are top notch
20,Fiko, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Unfortunately that was a complete disappointment when ordering via Deliveroo. The tartufiko lasagne was undercooked in the middle and cold, while the cheese on top was burned. The portion was very small even though it costed 22‚Ç¨. The ‚Ä¶"
21,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great vibe, outstanding service and amaaaaazing pizza"
22,Fiko, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Pizzas were great but they have an inexplicable rule of only letting you order in groups of 2 pizzas. Wanted to order 3 but they wouldn‚Äôt let us. Left a bit hungry, as we didn‚Äôt want 4!"
23,Fiko, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good pizza! The place is a bit on the smaller side and tables aren't that comfortable. Normally I order my pizza to take away.
24,Fiko, 2 stars ,a year ago,"This restaurant made a mistake on one of our pizzas (wrong one delivered...)
Preparation was very long (more than one hour when it said 30min)
Pizzas arrived cold. Taste was disappointing"
25,Fiko, 1 star ,a year ago,"Average pizza, overpriced for such poor quality. Also it already came cold at our table and when we complained, nothing has been done about it."
26,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic choice of pizzas, all absolutely delicious. Service friendly and unintrusive. A great find. We will be back."
27,Fiko, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"good pizza, unfortunate to not get the drinks i ordered on ubereats. i know i can get a refund, but doesnt change the fact i had to eat thirsty. still, one of the best pizzas ive had in amsterdam"
28,Fiko, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Excellent high end pizza's and anti pasti! Quality and Quality!!
29,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great pizza with smart concept of double pizzas plates. Very nice location in de Pijp, but a bit small so make sure to reserve your table."
30,Fiko, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good, nothing spectacular a bit pricey. The nutella dessert has way to much nutella, making it difficult to eat and at some point you can't continue eating."
31,Fiko, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great place, amazing food and super friendly staff!"
32,Fiko, 5 stars ,a month ago,Great taste and great vibe!
33,Fiko, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible inhumane place! I came here to pick up an online ordered pizza, and they did not only tell me to just wait outside but also refused me to use their toilet. For sure this was the first and last time I visit this restaurant!!"
34,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Top pizza bar! Italian design and really nice music! Amazing food!
35,Fiko, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The pizza, drinks, and atmosphere were excellent! Staff were friendly and kind."
36,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice place, small but romantic. I had pizza with truffle and mushroom and it was amazing!"
37,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best pizza in Amsterdam. Quality cheese, good ingredients. Ambiente is nice and the service quick and friendly."
38,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Go for pizza tartufi. Delicious!
39,Fiko, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Fantastic service and food !!
40,Fiko, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a rez. at 20:30 and was there on time. Only at 20:45 we were told our table would be ready in another 15 minutes. When you are 15 minutes late, they cancel your rez. but apparently they can make you wait half an hour :)"
41,Fiko, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best pizza in town... The one with pistachio or maybe the burata one. Incredible!
42,Fiko, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great black carbon pizza!

69,Fiko, 1 star ,5 days ago,Very unprofessional. We ordered pizza and had to wait more than two hours. We eventually called Fiko asking where the pizzas where and they responded that they couldn't do the order when the restaurant was full. Well don't accept orders in ‚Ä¶
70,Fiko, 1 star ,5 days ago,"I don't recommend ordering at this place, after waiting 1,5 hours and calling multiple times they finally picked up and told us they didn't even start making our pizzas because they took too many orders. In my opinion it's simple, if you ‚Ä¶"
