0,La Rive, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Unfortunately this restaurant does not have one vegan option. In 2021 I find this pretty strange, especially in a place like Amsterdam. When I asked the server if the chef would prepare us a vegan option (something I thought given the low …"
1,La Rive, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Considering this is the restaurant of a 5+ star hotel, that they charge 50€ for a 3 course menu and 9€ for a bottle of water, the objective rating should be negative but there is not an option. …"
2,La Rive, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"We had the 4-course dinner served on the terrace at the Amstel. The menu consisted of a ceviche, followed by pulpo, bavette and a desert. The food was of very good quality though nothing out of the ordinary. Service was very good."
3,La Rive, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I’ve had another absolutely amazing dinner experience at La Rive. I come here once or twice a year, visiting from the US, and the food, the service, the wines, the staff... they are all just unparalleled. …"
4,La Rive, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing experience/dinner. A group of us were in a private room and every detail of this experience was perfect. This is food elevated to art. I wish i would have taken more pics of the food but i was too busy enjoying it.
5,La Rive, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great fine dining experience. Very tasty and honest food and the presentation is superb as well. A lot of the fine dining places are now focused more on presentation and not so much about the original flavour of the ingredients. Also if you …
6,La Rive, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy, high quality experience with a great view of the river Amstel, especially the 4 tables next to the window. Small enough to feel quaint and intimate. Service is good and food quality is high. Fish is better than the meat."

10,La Rive, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My wife and I went for dinner and we were seated facing the canal, which was beautiful. The service and wait staff were fantastic and made us feel great. My wife had vegetarian food and I had non vegetarian food. Both of us loved almost every single dish that we had. Wine pairing was excellent."
11,La Rive, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had an absolutely delightful evening with impeccable service. The restaurant was above and beyond in two departments, food and service. The dishes were masterpieces in mixing fresh ingredients in season, alongside some excellent finesse. …"

13,La Rive, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow, this restaurant is top quality. From the maîtra d welcoming us outside door to the actual meal. Impressive."
14,La Rive, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We had dinner here, it was very quiet but the food took a very long time, wasn't really warm and the chef had forgotten the vegetables. Really expensive for what you get. Service was friendly but not very professional. I expected a lot more from this place."
15,La Rive, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It'd had been 3 years since I last dined here and at that time I thought it was the best vegetarian pre fixe meal I'd ever had, I I dine all over the world. Upon return to Amsterdam, my first move was to book a reservation here. I find its …"

17,La Rive, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A good experience overall. One minus worth mentioning - things moved very very slow. Basically, the starters came in about 10 minutes and the main course came 1 hour and 45 minutes in. To be fair, the waiters were all very very nice, …"
18,La Rive, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Upon return to Amsterdam, my first move was to book a reservation here. I find its best to do so in person so I went there, met one of the staff, looked over the dining room and chose a table that had the best set up for a single person and …"

23,La Rive, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Gorgeous interior and canal side view, but mediocre food, grossly overpriced. Service was attentive, but male waiters seemed gruff.  Head waiter was excellent, as was demure female server. Food is more appealing to a meat and seafood crowd. Patrons were mostly older, very overweight."

The waiters are helpful in the suggestions and the atmosphere is quite and elegant. …"

30,La Rive, 1 star ,3 years ago,I will never return to this place. Their website lists a dress code of casual chic with absolutely no detail as to what that entails. When my husband and I came for our reservation we were sent away since my husband was wearing Chino …
