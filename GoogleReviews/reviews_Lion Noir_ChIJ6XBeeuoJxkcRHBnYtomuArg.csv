1,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Great drinks and super nice back garden. Food was not that special - I was a bit disappointed to be honest.

4,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"I will say, the food is good. I had the fish. With couscous, and it was nice. The couscous done well. My date had the steak, with risotto and it was very tender. The white wine was really good. I was a little disappointed about the oysters. ‚Ä¶"
5,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Lovely restaurant with great location in the city centre, interior is nice, wonderful and friendly service, you don't need to wait long and waitresses help you with menu, they can cook bigger portion for you if you like the dish that goes ‚Ä¶"

10,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Lion Noir has very good steaks, perfectly cooked, nice service, not the most clean bathrooms. Also, I was disappointed by the desert. But in rest is a good place to go out in the city center."
11,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"When I was looking for the restaurant, I passed by it first since there is no clear sign/restaurant name, so had to walk back. ‚Ä¶"
12,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Delicious food at a reasonable price.
13,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Gorgeous food - really can‚Äôt fault it and the cocktails were great too. The service was disappointing thought - staff were very slow did not seem to have a system of which zone they were serving.
14,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Luxurious dining with luxurious service and tableware. Food was good but not that special for the price. Same goes for the decoration on the top floor.
15,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love that place. One of most splendid ambiences in Amsterdam I think, with super cute staff, very nice manager and great music. Awesome bites and coctails. Bloody mexican is a killer, alice delicious as well. Try blines with kaviar and tempura shrimps - Ill run back for them anytime! Next month we are throwing my bf bday there!"
16,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Great tasty steak. Weak flavored salmon. Nice ambience. BUT super small dishes. Eat at least 3 courses. In my opinion far too expensive for what u get. Won‚Äôt visit again.
17,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Pleasant lunch spot with a beautiful open air table section that cannot be seen from the street. Good selection of bottled wine. Not many by the glass wine options. Intetesting eclectic selection of sandwiches and salads. Excellent service.
18,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,a year ago,"4 courses diner menu is great, super tasty food. The Bloody Mary twist with Tequila is amazing!
Very nice courtyard, attentive and kind staff"
19,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is pricey and service was a bit clumsy (spilling wine for example, yes red wine üôà) for cocktails this is a great place with a nice ambiance right in the city center. For food you might want to check out the Tibetan food across the ‚Ä¶"
20,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The dinner was absolutely delicious and special! The service as well the food were outstanding to the last detail. The staff was personal and managed the service perfectly. We really had a romantic evening together, definitely a place to go back to!"
21,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best meal in Amsterdam. The 5 course meal is worth every penny. Its delicious and service is perfect
22,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a fixed group menu with 2 wine pairings.It was lovely with inspiring food combinations, just the exact quantity of food. They made me a lactose free desert which was amazing because otherwise they would have served panacota . Usually ‚Ä¶"
23,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Beautiful surroundings - a hidden garden in the center of Amsterdam. Probably the best service I‚Äôve ever had in the Netherlands - waiters who are genuinely happy to converse with you and take pride in their service. I just got home from ‚Ä¶
24,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great food and beautiful wines! But most importantly super nice atmoshere and staff.
25,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very cute and vibey restaurant. The decoration is beautiful and the service is nice and friendly. I didn't dine there but the snacks were good. Nice place to chill outside or dine inside.
26,Lion Noir, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Really slow and bit of rude service. Portions were small and did not arrive at same time. Some persons really had to wait a while. Taste was ok but not special. Won‚Äôt come here again for lunch
27,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,a year ago,Excellent 3-5 courses set menu and nice atmosphere of place.
28,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cozy and extra friendly staff. Everything we ordered (oysters, yellowfin appetizer, langoustine vichyssoise , monkfish, veal, and angus beef) was delicious and all of our plates were wiped clean. Highly recommend for dinner with family, dates or group of friends! Cocktails are yum too."
29,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great looking place although it looks like nothing from the street... My oysters with soya sauce and ginger were wonderfully fresh and super tasty...
30,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice cozy restaurant and bar with great food and a warm atmosphere. The staff was very friendly, even though I arrived very late in the evening. I can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
31,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic food and great cocktails. We were sitting downstairs because the restaurant upstairs was packed, which means the service was a bit slow, but the atmosphere and friendliness definitely made up for it."
32,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, tends to get full easily so make a booking if you really wanna try this place out. Foods good (around 25 euros) and staffs alright, best thing about this place is the atmosphere."
33,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Expensive look and interior. Quality food for a decent price eg lunch salad ~‚Ç¨9. Not 5 stars rated due to some of the staffs attitude.
34,Lion Noir, 2 stars ,8 months ago,We orderd steaktartar with ducklever. At the end the lever was served with the main course.  We had coquilles and they were over cooked en way too salty. The sauce and asperges were good. Next we had the duck which was also way too salty ‚Ä¶
35,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A really nice restaurant with good food and drink. Special design
36,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The inner patio is a peaceful gem hidden in one of the most convulsed Amsterdam streets. Food is as tasty as it seems and the overall experience was great too.
37,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful dining experience! We‚Äôve ordered the three-course ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù chef‚Äôs menu and were absolutely delighted with the taste, awesome from start to finish. Highly recommended, but you never know what you gonna get. Wine pairings were ‚Ä¶"
38,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome place. I love everything about it. The interior is beautiful, very stylish and not too many tables for lunch. The waiter was super friendly and gave us a lot of personal attention. The food was fresh, very good quality, especially ‚Ä¶"
39,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food and atmosphere was great. Service attentive and swift. Well worth going for the Chef's Menu, where you select either 3, 4 or 5 courses and are given whatever the chef selects. ‚Ä¶"
40,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,a year ago,Probably one of the best restaurants in Amsterdam. This restaurant features a beautiful garden and interior. Food was delicious and price a bit above the market but with a good reason. It was high quality. I find portioning a little bit too ‚Ä¶
41,Lion Noir, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Poor quality food. Lack of flavour although you can see they made effort on the presentation. Both steak and pork are dry without any sauce.  Prawn starter is small and very average taste. Really love the interior design of the restaurant but will not come back again.  Waiters were also a bit grumpy. Will not recommend.
42,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,a year ago,A great place in the heart of Amsterdam. Get a place outside and finish your dinner with the best shot: French kiss
43,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious and good quality food, nice atmosphere and good service. The chef's menu is the best option, every time I order it, it's always a good surprise!
The dessert could be served in a bigger portion."
44,Lion Noir, 2 stars ,2 years ago,From the moment i walk in it was off. I had read other reviews about the service and although each server was perfectly friendly they are disorganised and just a little uninterested. The drinks were good although we received them at ‚Ä¶
45,Lion Noir, 1 star ,a year ago,Came in to have a nice meal together and were quite disappointed. Bad service and had to send place settings back because it was dirty (old lipstick on the glasses). Didn't stay for the full meal.
46,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice tapas restaurant with good food. The service is excellent and the food is tasteful. The atmosphere is Cody and somehow authentic with good space and ability to talk without to much noise. The food is good and is served relative fast and taste as it should. I recommend this place for a good tapas
47,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great spot for a drink before or after dinner. Awesome courtyard at the back if it's a nice night. Cocktail menu looks awesome but unfortunately they didn't taste as awesome.  My whiskey and ginger beer cocktail was way too sweet and my ‚Ä¶
48,Lion Noir, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The interior is nice, the atmosphere is good but the portions of food we got for lunch were so small they could be called snacks. And the taste was just average, thus I found it overpriced. If your lunch/dinner is about the decoration, go there, but if it's about eating well try to avoid this place."
49,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Gorgeous back garden space, and just really really good food. The service is also significantly better than what you usually get in Amsterdam, with friendly waiters and hosts who try to make sure you're enjoying your time. The portions are ‚Ä¶"
50,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This was an excellent dining experience. The staff were very friendly and inviting, the restaurant was very well located, and the food was excellent. ‚Ä¶"
51,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Kitchen had jusssst closed and despite our instance they not, the staff seated us and stayed open to serve us! They were friendly, helpful, and warm. We hung out by the fire after we ate and enjoyed the wacky decor. Great food, good prices, and what a great staff. Say hi to the peacock for me!"
52,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I've been here only twice. First time was for cocktails where the bartender was really gracious and made me a brandy Alexander although it wasn't on the menu and he had never heard of it. (It was created perfectly!) I recently had a ‚Ä¶
53,Lion Noir, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Lion Noir offers a French-inspired menu, which looks good on the pictures but unfortunately doesn't taste as great as it looks. They do put a lot of effort in the presentation, yet it doesn't make up for the poor quality. Furthermore, the ‚Ä¶"
54,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Had a lovely evening with some friends at Lion Noir last summer We wanted to eat in the late afternoon when they were just about to close and then decided to make a reservation for dinner later that day. Staff was extremely friendly and we ‚Ä¶
55,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I only had some of the bar bites and drinks here.  The cheese platter and the charcuterie platter were nice and filled me up. They unfortunately had their kitchen closed at 4 PM do couldn't try their regular menu.
56,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The beer was rather warm. I wish her it came in colder glasses at least.
The food came in small portions but it was very delicious! It was great!
I recommend this place for the nice atmosphere and central location."
57,Lion Noir, 2 stars ,4 years ago,For the price the experience is sub par. Sitting in the garden at a table without a table cloth (other tables were made) on uncomfortable hipster chairs. Staff has an attitude and doesn't appear to have proper training. Prices are ‚Ä¶
58,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,a year ago,Gorgeous place. Comfortable atmosphere and good food. The slurpers (especially French kiss) are really good. Super staff too. Love it!
59,Lion Noir, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Looks great, but for some reason, didn't want to host us, twice.
I guess you need to wear a tux at least to get in, and look like a white 50ish guy who succeeded in corporate life. ‚Ä¶"
60,Lion Noir, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Good atmosphere. But extremely expensive compared to the quality of the dishes that were less than average: the fish and meat were highly overcooked whereas the vegetables were undercooked.
61,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cosy inside with a fire place. Great place to go for a bottle of wine and some snacks - try the popcorn chicken. In summer the beautiful garden at the back is lovely. For dinner upstairs they are almost always full, so best to book."
62,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,5 years ago,I had an awesome lunch. They had oysters and caviar on the menu. I'm not that posh so i had a great egg with ham and cheese. This is a place where i will have lunch again. The service was superb.
63,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,2 years ago,A decent restaurant with a great little outdoor garden in the back where you may also choose to eat your meal. I think the interior thrives at night when it is more of a bar scene than a dining experience.
64,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really amazing salads at lunchtime, gorgeous outdoor tables in hidden-away garden, varied cocktail menu (though didn't try them), good service. Reasonable prices. Very keen to go back."
65,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very very slow service, we needed to remind the waitress after 50min ordering. Nice decoration and terrace, food is good with rather small portions."
66,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had dinner at lion noir at it was an amazing experience. The place is cosy but elegant, upscale but not formal. The food was nothing less than wonder: beef tartare soft, delicate but with its own personality, the duck liver p√¢t√© was an ‚Ä¶"
67,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Good food and reasonable service in a very nicely decorated place. The portions are small and the prices high so go when someone else is paying for you. In summer you can sit in the garden out back.
68,Lion Noir, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"We decided to go straight to main to save room for dessert. My husband and I are not into huge portions but these main courses were so minuscule that we were still hungry. My husband had duck breast which was small, with some blobs of ‚Ä¶"
69,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The terrace is really nice, cozy and full of hydrangeas. It is not a cheap place, but the staff is nice, the food is quite good, and the cocktails are sooo good."
70,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely atmosphere and a live fireplace. Went in for lunch, extremely satisfied with Ceasar's salade. Music is also a good mix between oldies and new songs. Pricing is on point."
71,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Unfortunatly the service was not good. They even told us that they might forget about us as we sat inside and they ran around like chickens putting all focus on the outdoor seating. No organisation among the staff at all. A real shame as the place is really nice and the drinks we had did so they didnt get a 2 star rating.
72,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, amazing food and drinks"
73,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good atmosphere but food was a miss and definitely not worth the price (16‚Ç¨ starter, 26‚Ç¨ main). The monkfish was overcooked."
74,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lion Noir offers an French-inspired menu in a quirky decor.
Found antiquing at Antwerp and Paris flea markets, the skulls, stuffed animals and all the beautiful and slightly mysterious objects give an unusual yet ‚Ä¶"
75,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great service from Bobby and an excellent show of him sliding down the spiral staircase.  Worth every penny - I had the duck and cleaned my plate... And took a piece from my friend's plate too!!
76,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome. Had the Xmas Dinner and it was delicious.
77,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, especially the duck. Great wines. We had the pleasure to have warm weather and enjoy sitting out back on the beautiful terrace."
78,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, staff is friendly. Food is overall good despite small portions and funky food combination choices, e.g. serving popcorn with meat (what? why?)."
79,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food was amazing and the space was warm and inviting.
80,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, one blond girl during lunch was very rude and unprofessional. That made the experience much less good. Because the rest was great."
81,Lion Noir, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Please book to impress each other if dating..the expense and menu options will definitely impress an opinion that you are part of the set that prides themselves on having excessive income and a sophisticated dining habit ‚Ä¶
82,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Incredible, little spendy, lunch in one of the best kept secret back gardens of Amsterdam. In the middle of the city, you have no clue if sitting in the back garden. So peaceful and calm."
83,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good cocktails but not cheap and the slowest service possible. Waited for so long for every order and they didn‚Äôt even rush for the money to pay the bill.
84,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,a year ago,Lovely atmosphere and dinner.
85,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great restaurant! Love the chique and lovely vibe and interior! Portion of the menu is just great. Must try!

89,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice cocktails and terrace, inside atmosphere is cosy for cold nights. Food is consistently good, not exceptional for the price."
90,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing food and atmosphere. I ate a superb veal, and as a start a tastful caviar, they have very good prices  for the quality and level of the rest."
91,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome food! Just fantastic! Even better than two Michelin stars we have dined at recently!!!
92,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Went here for my birthday and had a 5 course meal. Well worth of my money. Looks great and tastes even better.
93,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Service needs improvement. Daily Fish dish was fantastic.

I suggest not ordering the duck dish - the meat was tough and the dish was unbalanced."
94,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice cocktail, but nothing too special about the place. Price range ‚Ç¨10-12 for most of the cocktails."
95,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a nice dinner in the garden
Food was great and very taste full. Our waitress was very attentive."

97,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love it here! Amazing dinner food, great selection of cocktails, and cozy ambiance."
98,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Cool hipster vibe in otherwise touristy area...reasonable prices too. Friendly staff and loved the dramatic decor (stuff peacock and antique tapestries with vintage furniture).
99,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful ambiance, fantastic cocktails and pretty good food. Service is lacking but the rest offsets"
100,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,4 years ago,I loved the vibe of the place. It is cozy and the bar area downstairs was a great place to relax and talk with friends. The service was slow at times.
101,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Lion Noir has an amazing interior, as if you are in a tastefully decorated colonial house that turns rock 'n roll after hours. The menu is French inspired, only more creative. After dinner the place transforms itself to a cocktailbar with ‚Ä¶"
102,Lion Noir, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful garden. Mostly inedible food. Avoid this place, it had so much potential and was a big let down."

111,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice food. Great music and atmosphere too.
112,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was OK, nothing special. But it was pricey for what you got and the eggs wasn't nearly enough to be filling. They also could do with some more vegetarian options."
113,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A very cozy place with a nice atmosphere.
Good prices on beer, and friendly people.
Nuff said ;)"

116,Lion Noir, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Ambiance is really cool, wine was great, but food was mediocre.  Next time I would go to have drinks downstairs, but not for dinner."
117,Lion Noir, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Ok-ish. Service was not really attentive. If I wouldn't have asked to settle the bill, I would still sit there waiting..."
118,Lion Noir, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great place in the center of Amsterdam. Fine dining. Not the best service in town. Modern but dark interior.
119,Lion Noir, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good food. Great to sit in the backside garden during summertime!
