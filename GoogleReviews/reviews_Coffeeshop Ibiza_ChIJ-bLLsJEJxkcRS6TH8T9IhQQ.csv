1,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Bought the pure indica one, small amount of weed, tip is longer then de joint itself, on first impression also tastes like herbal mix so not even 100% pure. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend here. Pretty steep prices for not so good products."

7,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice coffee shop in de pijp. It‚Äôs very well priced and had the best quality bud that I sampled the weekend I visited. It‚Äôs much better to get into coffee shops far from the red light district, with this being in de pijp I was confident it ‚Ä¶"
8,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 1 star ,3 months ago,The ‚Äújoint‚Äù was laced with tobacco and was super harsh because of that. Normally they have tobacco & marijuana products clearly marked.
9,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 1 star ,6 months ago,The owner mislead us by insisting on us buying his products without letting us inside the shop after the purchase. He would‚Äònt even allow us to use the toilet. ‚Ä¶

14,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 1 star ,a year ago,Pretty sure that most of the 5 star reviews are paid for. Notice that majority only have a single review and it's this place? Unlikely. ‚Ä¶

16,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Go here for a splendid high class lounge

Different levels, depending on what kind of vibe you want. Perfect place is you want a chill quiet not too crowded place to smoke. Definitely would suggest checking it out."
21,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice relaxing atmosphere, not too touristy. Good choices of herb. But they don't take Mastercard and the edibles taste like herb which ruined the cupcake even though it was moist and potent."
22,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Staff was friendly and the place had a good atmosphere, chill vibes. I loved the options and bought some Pineapple Xpress, it was very compact so the staff recommended grinding it which I appreciated. The lounge area was nicely decorated ‚Ä¶"

25,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice guy serving. Very patient and accommodating and friendly. Very helpful. Pre rolled joints (sativa) are 10 each if I recall correctly. There are cheaper places to get it but oh well. Thanks!
Edit in response to reply from owner."
26,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Prices are not the cheapest, but they do have decent deals and their cheapest stuff is pretty good too. Atmosphere is amazing, cute stoned cat, lots of space, different rooms, great music and very friendly staff. If you wanna stay and chill ‚Ä¶"
27,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,a year ago,A slightly confusing aesthetic with the smokers lounge meeting the Mediterranean brick being lit by Morrocan lanterns (guess that's a nod to the hash). Watch out for the crocodiles! Incredibly comfy sofas with some very jam beats to bun up ‚Ä¶
28,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great coffeeshop. The prices are a little higher than expected but the service, atmosphere and weed are very good."
29,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Really cool vibe, lots of room to sit down, good products, friendly staff

30,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Awesome. Brilliant stuff and great prices. Also two wonderful and completely different seating areas.. Downstairs is more chilled and laid back with less impressive(but firing) decor, then upstairs is beautiful, with a variety of furnishings that are all pretty elegant to be fair. Our favorite coffee shop."
31,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Second time in Amsterdam and visited a few times. Lots of seating great for groups of people just looking for good weed or just a quiet smoke. Our favourite coffeeshop in Amsterdam and will be back again to visit. Great staff and great products. It also has the cutest resident cat.
32,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 1 star ,a year ago,"It is ugly, it is slow, and it smells bad. I cannot get all these tourist positive reviews on this very bad place, where nothing's worth having a look around. Clearly many better places and less far from the center!"

Best weed, fair prices! and good coffee!!!!"
34,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"A perfect place to relax & enjoy some great coffee in a friendly, modern atmosphere.  I've visited this spot on many occasions & have never been disappointed.  The menu describes them as 'highly addictive' and they are not kidding. I amazed ‚Ä¶"
35,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,6 years ago,A very plea sent experience indeed. Spent a few good days of my holiday at this place. The menu was just simply amazing and the nice music played in the background was truly a pleasant experience. Will definitely go again if I am ever back in the country.
36,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing coffeeshop, great menu and prices, tasty edibles, fantastic bud and Good vibes, friendly staff and a pretty cool owner, you feel welcome and respected. Nice decor and several TVs, music, whether you choose to hop on a bar stool or kick-back on the sofas this relaxed place couldn't get any more chill."
37,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 4 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best coffeeshops I went in. On the outskirts of the city which means it's quiet with the odd few locals in. Chilled upstairs section with comfy couches and a comforting cat wandering about the place. Awesome vibe to smoke your head off!
38,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Best strains of weed available and the cashier was straight forward with no personality. I visiting in summer and it was way to hot inside with no grinders or bongs available to use but provided rolling papers and roaches. Place to buy weed and smoke elsewhere. I would come back for the green crack!
39,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Unimpressive and a rip-off. Bought an over-priced muffin, ate the whole thing and felt absolutely nothing. The guy behind the counter was neither friendly nor pleasant, like he had so much to do and I was bothering him with my purchase - ‚Ä¶"
40,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. My boyfriend and I were on a trip to Amsterdam and accidentally meet the owner while having beer. Awesome guy with lots of advice. This is the place to come and enjoy your smoke, just chill and recuperate! From all of ‚Ä¶"
41,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Coffeeshop IBIZA was the first coffee shop me and my boyfriend came into after landing in Amsterdam.   There was a lovely selection of choice but ultimately I persuaded my boyfriend to go with agent orange. One of my favourites by far. ‚Ä¶
42,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We took the long way round to find it from the centre! But when we found it the guy was proper friendly and the atmosphere was great. Had the football on as well so we spent a nice afternoon downstairs chilling. We'll  be back soon!
43,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 1 star ,a year ago,"Today he sold me 0.83 in stead of 1 g.
I saw him leaving something on the bottom of his jar just after he checked the weight, I saw him that he noticed that small piece of hash. Was Caramelo hash 13 euro per gram. He made me pay 12.50 with no reason. My professional scale says 0.83 üëçüèª"
44,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I've been here about three times now and I love this place! I discovered Coffeeshop IBIZA Amsterdam by chance when getting off work one day. That day, I had an AMAZING cookies and cream cupcake with a great cup of coffee. There is a great ‚Ä¶"

47,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The Stud has the friendliest staff of any coffee shop I have ever been to. The quality of the weed is excellent, and they are very knowledgeable about their products. I'd definitely recommend a tourist or local to try them out."
48,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I absolutely love this place, it reminds me of old coffee shop that i use to go, but a lot more affordable. The people who work there really invite you in, they always have a smile on their faces and I've never been to a better coffee shop ‚Ä¶"
49,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excelent mood, the staff is fantastic, everything is cool and immersed on a fine-energy cloud. There's an anthologic cat always sleeping next to the cashier. It was recomended by a friend, and I'm glad my first time in a coffee shop was at the best one."
50,Coffeeshop Ibiza, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I've been here several times and always liked it. Great atmosphere and a good selection of what I want. Like to sit in the window with a coffee and spliff while I glance at the steady stream of tourists outside... :-)
