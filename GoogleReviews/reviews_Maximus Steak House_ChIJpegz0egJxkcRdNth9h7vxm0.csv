5,Maximus Steak House, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The Spare ribs were dry and the salad on the side was not fresh. Despite of these the steaks were good but we had to pay separately for its sauce.
6,Maximus Steak House, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"mediocre food, but great friendly staff. ambience could be better.  feels too much of a tourist magnet."

11,Maximus Steak House, 1 star ,3 years ago,I will never come back. We asked for Coca Cola and they served Pepsi. When we wanted to changed for water they putted in the bill Coca Cola instead of water because it was more expensive. Food didn’t taste good.
12,Maximus Steak House, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very good and tasty and omg the meat is awesome! And the waitresses are very nice too, I’ll definitely be back!"

17,Maximus Steak House, 3 stars ,2 years ago,So first and foremost... Staff are amazing.. But medium steak should be medium. .Not overcooked outside and rare inside.. Completely unhappy with the outcome of my steak.. Sent back once. .Came back after 30 seconds.. Sent back again …
18,Maximus Steak House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I have been coming here for 5 years. It's an amazing place near city center with reasonable prices and delicious menu. I myself have always ordered it's kalf ribs but their steaks are great too. Ribs here are halal as well and it's one of the very few places that serve it in Amsterdam. Highly recommended.
19,Maximus Steak House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic. The best meal we had in all 8 days. It’s a shame we discovered it on our last night. The filet was spectacular. I suppose steak sauce would be a nice touch, but when you cook it perfect no sauce required."
20,Maximus Steak House, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Average mix grill. Nice meat, but price way too high for the quantity of food. I recommend it anyway"
21,Maximus Steak House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wonderful meal my favorite of the 3 days we spent in Amsterdam. They were wonderful the chef the waitresses and waiters they made me the most beautiful special order salad I wish I could show you a picture. George loved his steak
22,Maximus Steak House, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"We dined here as a party of six, so I got a good idea of most of their culinary offering, including starters, mains and side dishes. Sadly, the quality of the food was generally mediocre at best, and downright shoddy at worst. I personally …"
23,Maximus Steak House, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I Wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy! After walking in and being sat at a table, 2 minutes later, I spotted a RAT walking around under the tables!

26,Maximus Steak House, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Outstanding steak. Nice location in Amsterdam. Good service. A bit pricey. Offers a wide range of meals. Lost a star for toilet cleanliness and table setting
27,Maximus Steak House, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very good food. Both the meat and the fish mixed platters were of very high quality. Also the service was good and professional.
28,Maximus Steak House, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Standard stakehouse, nothing special, not great, considering it is located just by the Hard Rock Cafe in which is probably its biggest competitor. Tried a maximus burger. Cold tomato and a not very grilled bun. Just okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Also, fries comes without complementary dip."
29,Maximus Steak House, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing steakhouse with the friendliest and most polite staff ever! I came back the night after and was greeted with "" Welcome back! How are you tonight?"". The food and beverages was as excellent as the friendly staff and the cool …"
30,Maximus Steak House, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This place was an absolute shambles. TERRIBLE wait staff and a giant argument with the manager when his staff got an order wrong and left a member of our party waiting for food for 45 extra minutes, and blamed her afterwards. Do not recommend. Not friendly in the slightest. Also, tap water is NOT free."
31,Maximus Steak House, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Not impressed in any way. Service was really not good. We ordered tenderloin, and got something totally different. They could not spilt the bill, and the waiters did not understand proper English. I normally would not give the worst rating, but overall really not a good experience."
32,Maximus Steak House, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I went there yesterday with my girlfriend and we ordered an hamburger with chips and the spareribs for her with two cokes.
The 1 star I am giving is for two reasons: one is that the spareribs were not …"
33,Maximus Steak House, 1 star ,2 years ago,Worst meal in years. Steak was smelly and could not even hide the bad smell with pepper and the sauce. Also check your bills. They Overcharged us
34,Maximus Steak House, 2 stars ,5 years ago,The biggest issue I had with the place was the RED lighting. You cant actually see what your food looks like. A couple of the wings we ordered were burnt and you couldn't tell. …
35,Maximus Steak House, 4 stars ,6 years ago,I order sirloin steak with eggs. And I request my steak to be medium rare. But when I sliced my meat... Ta da! It is well done. Little bit dissappointed but it's okay because it has delicious taste! The eggs are perfect! Love it.
36,Maximus Steak House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The pizza is amazing cooked 8n a wood fired oven this is my second time visiting on my weekend break. Just about to try the ribs so will write another review soon.
37,Maximus Steak House, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We waited for over 15 minutes to be served. After watching two parties get served twice by waitresses, we were still waiting, not looking at phones, not looking at menus and continued to be ignored. We are Black but am hoping that wasn't the issue but we feel it was because all the white people were tended to"
38,Maximus Steak House, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"o add to the comment, It was amazing considering this is the heart of Amsterdam filled with tourist trap food factories. …"

40,Maximus Steak House, 1 star ,3 years ago,DO NOT EAT HERE!! Half way through eating our meal my boyfriend spotted a mouse running around the kitchen. When pointed out to the waiter he said it was a common problem in Amsterdam and there are mice infestations in all restaurants here. …
