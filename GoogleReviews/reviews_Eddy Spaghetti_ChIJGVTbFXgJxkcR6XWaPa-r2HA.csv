0,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Best pasta in Amsterdam  üçù! We ordered Tartufo pasta and spaghetti with meatballs, both super yummy! We drank Aperol Spritz, also ü§§ü§§ü§§ and for dessert Affogato (this was the best part!). The staff was super nice üòä
If you come to Amsterdam, you need to try this üáÆüáπ"
1,Eddy Spaghetti, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Great local restaurant. The food was tasty and it was all very well priced. Their pastas and raviolli were far better than their pizzas. Staff was very friendly. They had a lovely well heated and covered outdoor terrace too. Would recommend for anyone looking for a restaurant away from the touristy hustle and bustle in Amsterdam.
2,Eddy Spaghetti, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"We had my friends birthday dinner here ! I ordered the Tartufo Spaghetti (spaghetti with truffle sauce, parmesan cheese and rucola). It was a pretty basic and safe choice - however i felt that the pasta was a little better overcooked. I ‚Ä¶"
3,Eddy Spaghetti, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Very good Italian food and friendly staff. We had a great time at this quaint little spot. I recommend the ragu with a bottle of red.
4,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very delicious truffle spaghetti was served warm. Size was good enough, not too much not less than expected. Olives with various types were amazingly fresh and delicious. I had a very light and fruity rose wine and it was perfectly cold. everything was served on time by friendly staff. Affogato with stracciatella was really good."
5,Eddy Spaghetti, 3 stars ,a month ago,"Feels not really like italian food. Quite overpriced for a small basic location. The Pizza was good but the burrata hasnt anything to do with italian kitchen. Very Dutch version of italian food. Will not go there again, therefor I cant recommend it!"
6,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great food (although limited options) but all are extremely tasty. The pizza's are magnificent (thin crust but crispy). The Tiramisu is to die for and the cocktails are worth the pricetag. Staff is friendly and prompt. Recommended!
7,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Its not a big menu but we had 4 different meals and all were very good. Waitress working on her own was excellent
8,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice location, great food, nice and fast Service. A bit out of the center of the city, but definitely worth a visit. We had a nice starter amd the Main course was great as well. We had Pasta and Pizza."
9,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Really amazing food and staff, I would say this is one of the best meals we‚Äôve ever had. Highly recommend"
10,Eddy Spaghetti, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Okay food - pasta is better then the starters. Inside is a bit crammed and tables are too small for food, so if the weather allows its better to sit outside."
11,Eddy Spaghetti, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Casual, friendly neighborhood local spot with very good pasta (have been several times and just once had a dish that didn‚Äôt wow me, hence reserving the 5th star). Great terrace with heat lamps, small indoor space."
12,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Don't let the name fool you. I was a bit sceptical coming here, as the name suggested a bit of a novelty restaurant. Instead I got treated to some tasty truffle and mushroom spaghetti followed by affogato in a cosy venue. ‚Ä¶"
13,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The limoncello and the tiramisu are really nice. The pasta is amazing. Good wines, and the servers have expertise and know how to answer your questions."
14,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The meal was outstanding.  Super fresh and very creative.  One of the best Italian dishes I have ever had was the pappardelle venison ragu.
15,Eddy Spaghetti, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"I hope our food was an exception, because it was very bland and gummy. If you have spaghetti in the name, you have to live up to the expectations. Two stars because service and location were good."
16,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,a year ago,"In the last few months I‚Äôve visited this place regularly, to pick up my order. I literally live 50 meters away. It is really good, and these guys need every order to keep their heads above water. I tried all pastas and they are all good. ‚Ä¶"
17,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely dining spot, extra small and mainly reservations. We came early, so seat at the bar was open. We ordered Pasta Al Ragu Di Manzo, Pizza Funghi E Tartufo, side salad and garlic pesto bread . I was looking for a solid Italian restaurant ‚Ä¶"
18,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Little gem in East. Fantastic pasta, friendly service and cosy atmosphere. Had a lovely meal!"
19,Eddy Spaghetti, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Delicious food. However, one of the pastas was cold. The service was quite poor."
20,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,2 months ago,I celebrated my birthday here. lovely stuff and delicious food.
21,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We spent three nights in this part of Amsterdam and planned to try three places to eat. Found Eddy's on the second night and it was good enough for us to go back our final night. No pretensions to be fancy, just welcoming atmosphere and ‚Ä¶"
22,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really great pizza, very friendly service and a lovely place to eat!"
23,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Brought our whole family of 9 here and everyone loved their food. Amazingly fresh and home cooked ingredients and the drinks were incredible too. The atmosphere was romantic and charming and felt perfect on an evening. I strongly recommend this place. NOTE: Food stops serving at 10pm
24,Eddy Spaghetti, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Our first time at this little spot in the neighborhood. The service was fast and attentive and accommodated us well. The drinks were nice,  the ‚Äúciabatta‚Äù bread for 4,50‚Ç¨ - not so much, it didn‚Äôt taste fresh. The vegetarian antipasti plate ‚Ä¶"
25,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food at Eddy Spaghetti was great! I would recommend for everybody to try it. Usually I don't like to go to Italian restaurants because I think I am also able to cook pasta myself pretty well but the food there was on a whole other ‚Ä¶
26,Eddy Spaghetti, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is pretty average. Not saying it's bad, but this place has nothing exceptional. We ordered 2 meals and 2 appetizers, and not one thing stood out. The service is pretty slow. Now you may not be too bothered, if you want 25-30 min ‚Ä¶"
27,Eddy Spaghetti, 4 stars ,a year ago,The pasta here is definitely the star for me and really get a craving for the All‚Äôarrabbiata Tricolore every so often. Tried the pizza recently and although enjoyable wasn‚Äôt quite there vs some other local spots. Really enjoy the outdoor space in the sun and service is always friendly.
28,Eddy Spaghetti, 4 stars ,a year ago,Pizzas are in electric oven so no wooden oven but food is good
29,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to get some pasta. Always good service with friendly staff. It's advisable to reserve your table if you intend on dining after 6:30-7pm. Wine options could be more expansive. ‚Ä¶
30,Eddy Spaghetti, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was correct, the restaurant was busy and needed to eat at the bar."
31,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely amazing pasta. Service was super kind and quick, the beer selection is great as well and if you do not try the Tiramisu you are missing out on some really really good dessert. 11/10 would recommend to their friends."
32,Eddy Spaghetti, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Had the mushroom risotto special and it was delicious! Well balanced flavours and great portions. My only low light was the service; they definitely needed more serving staff on the Sunday night and the time taken to be served/ pay the bill was a little excessive
33,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing service, amazing food, amazing vibe. Not in the neighbourhood? Trust me, it's worth your little trip. And o, don't be afraid main is too little, they are just letting you safe up for the Tiramisu which can't be missed."
34,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great food! Our favourite combination is the spaghetti Al vongole with pizza stravaganza!
35,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We've been there in the summer for an early dinner. Great place to be. Excellent vibe. Good staff, great menu (I personally like menus that are short and sweet rather than hundreds of items on the offer), generous portions, decent prices. ‚Ä¶"
36,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing burrata, reasonably priced pasta and pizza."
37,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The focaccia bread was amazing. The pizza and pasta were both good too, but could use some additional flavor. Good prices. Staff very friendly and English persons were greeted nicely."
38,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,a year ago,For me its really never a miss when ordering here. Got inspired to write this review because I got a small bonus delicious creamy chocholaty tiramisu along with my order :)
39,Eddy Spaghetti, 3 stars ,a year ago,Pasta arrabiata & pasa vongole could have tasted so much better if Eddy cut back on the salt (couldn't taste anything else). Pizza's tasted good!
40,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best pasta I‚Äôve eaten in a long time. Friendly staff, nice outdoor seating and heating. Good menu choice.
One of the hidden gems"
41,Eddy Spaghetti, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Really over-rated... Clearly not made by Italians, just has the name. The courses are very basic, the starter called ""ciabata"" is literally just bread and the ""italian flat bread"" is a sort of nan with garlic on top... And it takes forever ‚Ä¶"
42,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food was amazing and would go back
43,Eddy Spaghetti, 1 star ,2 years ago,We were waiting for spaghetti about 50 m. Crazy! The stuff didn't warn that COOKING of main course will be started only when we finish starters. The male waiter was extremely rude. We will avoid this place in the future.
44,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This gorgeous, cosy Italian spot was just perfect for a solo traveller like me - so much so, that I went two nights in a row! The staff were just delightful and greeted me warmly (and in English) on both occasions. The food was INCREDIBLE ‚Ä¶"
45,Eddy Spaghetti, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Original Italian menu, nice desserts and good hospitality. Plus finally a place in Amsterdam to eat out late! Only con is that the red wine was served at ambient temperature (which is obviously too warm)."
46,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The staff were extremely friendly! The food was amazing and served very quickly. Overall couldn‚Äôt fault our experience and would definitely recmmonend and go again. Thank you :)
47,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"As a visitor to the area I would come back here without hesitation. Visited on weekday night and inside was busy but they had heaters and blankets on their outside tables. Friendly staff, good service and very tasty food. Oh and some great beers too."
48,Eddy Spaghetti, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Mediocre service and average food in an uninspiring residential location. We had to ask for a dessert menu (which never came) and we also had to ask for our table to be cleared. It's the small things that make the difference.
49,Eddy Spaghetti, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Delivery was fast and friendly, pizzas were just bad. Pizza pasta was obviously not fresh and was VERY soft with some overcooked spots. Disappointed considering the price and previous positive experiences."
50,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was delicious! The atmosphere so cozy and the staff helpful and kind. MUST try their tiramisu. Great job, worth every penny!!"
51,Eddy Spaghetti, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious and cozy atmosphere.

64,Eddy Spaghetti, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Good food and service!
65,Eddy Spaghetti, 1 star ,2 years ago,Waiting for our food for an hour just to get kicked out before finishing because the next guests have arrived. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all cost.
66,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Extraordinary and unique pizza, polite staff and good outside area."
67,Eddy Spaghetti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Solid italian option. Burrata pasta and truffle pizza are go to items for eating in and delivery.
