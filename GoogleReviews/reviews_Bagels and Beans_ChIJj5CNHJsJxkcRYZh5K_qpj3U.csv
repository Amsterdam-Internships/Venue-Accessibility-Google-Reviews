0,Bagels and Beans, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Incredibly slow serving. We waited at least 30 minutes to get the waiter attention (despite asking multiple times) and another 30 minutes to get the food. The food is good but the servings are small for the price.
Wouldn't recommend."
1,Bagels and Beans, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Food was overpriced and the worst service l‚Äôve ever seen in my life. We ordered our food and it took more than half an hour for it to come (when it came), because some items were missing. My friend had to eat the leftovers from our plates ‚Ä¶"
