0,Exit Café, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Staff is very rude! 3 of us had a pitcher of vodka something and when my friend asked how many shots are in one because we can barely feel it, the waiter answered him; maybe you are too alcoholic to feel it!
On the bill we saw there were only 2 shots!!! Low quality place"

7,Exit Café, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Small but i have to say good fun ever. From security guy outside (very friendly) to bar staff. All kinds of music. A down side is toilet staff. They look more as security dogs. As tourist we didnt know we have to pay (didnt see written …

12,Exit Café, 1 star ,3 years ago,No possibilities to get quickly fresh air. You have to queue again for at least 20 minutes in your T-Shirt. Questionable Club rules and questionable stuff.
