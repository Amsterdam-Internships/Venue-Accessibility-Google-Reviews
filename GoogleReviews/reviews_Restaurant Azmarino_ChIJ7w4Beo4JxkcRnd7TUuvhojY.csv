0,Restaurant Azmarino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great African restaurant. Food was freshly prepared and the Mongozo beer is definitely worth a try as it comes in unique flavors; we had coconut and mango. We ordered the chef's combinations special, which came with chicken, pork, and lamb. The lamb was our favorite. Since the food is made fresh, it does take a while, but worth the wait."
1,Restaurant Azmarino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Our friend took us here and she couldn‚Äôt pick a better place for dinner. Delicious food, drinks and very friendly atmosphere. The way the food is served is unlike anywhere else we‚Äôve been before. If you ever come to Amsterdam you should definitely go here and experience it üëåüèª"
2,Restaurant Azmarino, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The food was tasty but the portions were too small for us. You can find some African beers! Family style place so the decor is a bit tacky but adds to the character I suppose :)
3,Restaurant Azmarino, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Food was tasty, but the servings were ridiculously small. For example 4‚Ç¨ for 2 tiny samossas. Cutlery was not provided, we had to use our hands. But that made it somehow authentic and we liked it.  The service was very kind.
I would rate it higher if servings were bigger."
4,Restaurant Azmarino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The nicest Ethiopian, Eritrean food I've had anywhere in the world. Simple, excellent food and relaxing environment, with friendly staff."
5,Restaurant Azmarino, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Azmarino has been and still is my favourite Ethiopian Restaurant in Amsterdam. I recommend to order the mixed plate, with the chef‚Äôs selection. It‚Äôs a variety of meats, vegetables and flavours. Or completely vegetarian if you like. Choose ‚Ä¶"

8,Restaurant Azmarino, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Went here for dinner before the lockdown in October and the food was fabulous! Service was great and super friendly as well. Hope they reopen soon!!
9,Restaurant Azmarino, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was delicious!  The whole African experience is very special.  The amount of food they serve is great.  I didn't expect I would get so full when I saw the plate, but magically in the end I didn't have any room for dessert.  Plus the service is great and the price is totally affordable."
10,Restaurant Azmarino, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Went in thinking I wouldn't be full from the small portion of meat they served but boy, was i wrong. Food is amazing with excellent service. Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert, would've love to try the chocolate cake though. Definitely recommend the banana and mango beer."
11,Restaurant Azmarino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A nice Ethiopian restaurant with tasty dishes and great beers. Loved the mango beer served in a coconut :-) I also love the fact that you're supposed to eat with your hands from a big plate and share all the food together. Definitely a bonding experience.

19,Restaurant Azmarino, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Tasteful food, but not served very warm. Portions are good, price is relatively low. The restaurant was quite cold during a winter evening.. Feels like a budget style restaurant, perhaps not the best choice for extended meals."
