9,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good portions, decent price. Slow to make the food. Nice servers. Ceasae salad dressing was too sweet and tangy. Wish they used anchovy dressing.  The Fruti di marre was $17 and pasta portion was small compared to other dishes. The big …"
10,Pasta e Basta, 1 star ,6 months ago,Waited in total about 2 hours. 3 of us got our food an hour into waiting. They forgot the other TWO people at all our tables food so then we had to wait another 45 mins while we ate our food while they had nothing.

14,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great fast service. Food was great. The bread was AWESOME! We ate down stairs so I don't know what the upstairs was like but the down stairs is great for good in and out food.
15,Pasta e Basta, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Only reason I’m giving it a four and not a five is because the takeout portion was SO small. Been there several times and have always gotten the same dish. Ordered two of the Lobster Alla Marre to go and it was like they split one portion …
16,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"I made reservations at the Pasta E  Basta restaurant in Amherst, Massachusetts, for my Mother's Day dinner after my brother raved about their food.  I was not disappointed. The atmosphere was friendly and welcoming, and the exposed brick of …"

19,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The wait staff is absolutely amazing. Pizza is some of the best I've had.
20,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The food was amazing. You do have to climb a ton of stairs to get to the tables but I guess work out before you eat lol.  The price is good also.
21,Pasta e Basta, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The service was consistent.  The food is very good.  Their house bread is amazing, similar to focaccia, but lighter.  I was a little disappointed in the size of the cocktail.  The glass was fine but it was only 3/4 full.  The staircase to …"

35,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I love this place.  I came here graduation weekend and the place was very busy.  We still got our food very quickly and the service was great.  I will always come back.  I recommend the vodka sauce but the rest of the family enjoys the alfredo.  Save some of the bread to dip on the sauce.  Take out is a good option too.
36,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great pasta choices, I had the build your own pasta dish, opting for broccoli alfredo. We ate in the casual downstairs dining room on a previous visit. The menu is similar if not identical and the main difference I saw was that seating is less crowded upstairs."

40,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"By far my favorite place to eat! The first time I went was a Tuesday afternoon and my date and I were the only ones there. They were so nice and the food was amazing! The second time was quite busy, but they still treated us like we were …"

48,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The restaurant is in a great location. Right across a nice park with a convenient parking lot across from the restaurant. Inside the atmosphere is nice and has a Mediterranean feel to it. The food and service are great with the prices being equal to the size of the food served. Definitely will be coming back. PS from Agawam
49,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Been 3 times now and every single time the food was incredible! Only flaw is the service is below average. But if you’re looking for fantastic Italian food you will leave very full and happy.
50,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"I ate here last night, and was blown away.  I got grilled shrimp and my companion got grilled rosemary chicken; both came with assorted grilled vegetables and salad. In my experience, simple preparations like this can be just terrible if …"
51,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cocktails were fairly priced and well made. The bread was the most amazing with thr basil and oil dip, the food was quick and delicious. I sat on the 2nd floor and the view of the town common was delightful. Highly recommended for a date night. 2 people can have fine dining and drinka for under $60."
52,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My experience was phenomenal. The appetizers were delicious. The calamari wasn’t  oily and the mussels were seasoned very well. And the pasta was amazing!!
53,Pasta e Basta, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Large portions and convenient location are the big plus points for this italian (fine dining joint) restaurant.  The food is decent although I have not encountered a dish yet that has impressed me.  The staff is friendly.
54,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"EXCELLANT SERVICE, EXCELLENT FOOD!! Worth the trip from Connecticut!"
55,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,6 years ago,What a delightful place.  Staff was great.  The food was delicious.

Will definitely go back!
56,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Exceptional food every time.
57,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food at good prices. We ate at the ground level restaurant which is cafeteria style (probably mostly take out), but the food was great. I've will definitely go back."
58,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food. Fair warning though, they have large servings! So might want to consider sharing if you're used to smaller portions. Personally, I looooved their shrimp!"

65,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First time, loved the fresh bread and oil. Service on point. Everyone very helpful and kind. Will be back. Chicken parm with broccoli no pasta made very well."
66,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Never had a poor experience here. This is the place to go if you want good Italian and great atmosphere. Date night recommendation is to get a seat on the top level by the window. Especially in the winter time when the tree in the town green is lit up.
67,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great pasta, great drinks. The Chicken Parm is a must, but don't be afraid to explore! A true classic of downtown Amherst."
68,Pasta e Basta, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Tasty food but very uneven service.  I cannot digest onions or more than a bit of garlic. Told server this.  Salad came covered in onions and wine sauce had too much garlic.
69,Pasta e Basta, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"A very no-frills, somewhat unique, more than just spaghetti and meatballs establishment. The food is tasty and reasonably priced; the portions are fairly generous."
70,Pasta e Basta, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This place has great food which comes in huge portions, so come very hungry but also very patient because if you're sitting upstairs you could be in for a wait. It's not a fancy place but I probably wouldn't go wearing sweatpants either."
71,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great little place in a nice location in Amherst. Food is delicious and service was great! Look forward to eating there in the future!
72,Pasta e Basta, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Down home ""Italian"" food. I wouldn't say it's authentic or a culinary gem, but really it can hit the spot. Have never had anything less than delicious, always leave full and with leftovers."
73,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic experience. Great Italian food. The meatballs were fresh. Everything prepared had a homestyle taste to it. Will definitely be back

77,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I look forward for the bread basket and the home olive oil dip, my entree is the crazy alfado. They have multiple floors over all its a great place to eat for lunch and dinner."
78,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place to go for anyone who likes Italian food. Food was good quality and service was good. Was fortunate to get a window seat on one of the higher floors.
79,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The greatest restaurant in existence. Service is great can be a little slow sometimes. It's worth it. If you're in a rush, take out downstairs is a little faster."

81,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My all time favorite restaurant! Delicious Italian fare.....house made bread and dipping oil are given to every table! Amazing gnocchi!

97,Pasta e Basta, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"It wasn't bad, but the vodka sauce is not vodka sauce. Also the marinara was sub par. For a place with pasta in the name, not impressed."
98,Pasta e Basta, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Bread and atmosphere is amazing! But the red sauce is not my cup of tea and the service/ wait could improve.
99,Pasta e Basta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A superb chicken parmesan meal. Get it with meatballs if you are feeling extra sweaty. Don’t forget to say hi to Eduardo
