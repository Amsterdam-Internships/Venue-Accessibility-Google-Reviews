5,The Mexican, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It was my first time experience to try Mexican food, the shop was small, but lovely, but to be correct the food wasn't something i liked at all, maybe because we're used to another kind of food, although we had ordered two different things ‚Ä¶"

12,The Mexican, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Ordered the Entreec√≥te Beef Steak. Portion as per the picture. Note that the cost is ‚Ç¨17.50 for a 300gram steak. Reasonably priced for a meal in the heart of Amsterdam pretty near to the red light district touristy area. For the ‚Ä¶
13,The Mexican, 1 star ,3 years ago,"As you can see  in the pictures, the ""lunch deal"" costs 9.90 euros. Me and my boyfriend had lunch there (at around 2 pm) when we were in Amsterdam for a weekend, but this price was not applied to us. When we saw the attractive price of the ‚Ä¶"
14,The Mexican, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I was kind of surprised by how good the burrito was. I wasn't expecting the Mexican food to be great but this was a real taste of Mexico in the midst of Amsterdam. Great food! A little bit pricey but the. Again al the restaurants on that street are.
15,The Mexican, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"The food at the Mexican was great, be careful if you're not at all into spicy food as mexican dishes often are. You could probably ask without jalapenos. The staff (1 serving, 1 cooking) were kind and great at their respective jobs. Service was quick and and the atmosphere felt like you were being served authentic mexican food."
16,The Mexican, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Located a few paces off Dam Square.  Friendly folks that appreciate your business. Place is spotlessly clean. Great place to sit outdoors and watch the crowd go by. Excellent ribs  and steak . Nothing fancy but I highly recommend it.

34,The Mexican, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We absolutely love this place and it‚Äôs a staple for all of our trips to Amsterdam. The food is amazing and there‚Äôs a nice atmosphere. Would highly recommend the fajitas! Portion sizes are huge but you‚Äôll definitely be cleaning your plate!
35,The Mexican, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely loved this place. Happened to walk past it and was intrigued by Mexican food in Europe. I live in NYC so have had my fair share of mexican food and the burrito and rice as well as the salsa and chips tasted incredibly authentic ‚Ä¶
36,The Mexican, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is good, service is fast and friendly.  I had a chicken enchilada, a beef enchilada and rice.  My wife had a burrito.  All was pretty good, but not exceptional.  Frozen house margarita wasn't that great, but did have plenty of tequila. ‚Ä¶"
37,The Mexican, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Got the chicken fajitas and we LOVED IT, super tasty, big portion, very nice staff, great neighborhood"
38,The Mexican, 3 stars ,3 years ago,This place is what it is: a place for the owners to make some money off of the steady stream of tourists! ‚Ä¶
39,The Mexican, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best mexican restaurant in Amsterdam, i always order their fajitas, so tasty. I sent there twice in 6 years, and food is yummy"
40,The Mexican, 1 star ,6 months ago,Not good at all‚Ä¶ they use cheap meat and you can taste it
41,The Mexican, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Big portions. Good food (what I ordered as quesadilla wasn't quesadilla but it was rich with ingredience) for good price. Staff could be nicer, food was focused rather on quantity than quality but overall we were satisfied. Way to toilet with plenty of very steep steps."
42,The Mexican, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had a nice dinner here. A good enchilada and a big plate of nicely spiced loaded Nacho's. Service is quite quick and the prices are decent for a spot near the Dam. It's pretty cosy in a good way. ‚Ä¶
43,The Mexican, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Delicious food!
44,The Mexican, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lost count of how many visits we have had here but it is always really good. This time we were looking to eat quite late an knew that this would be one of the places which would definitely be open. We arrived around 11:30pm and there were ‚Ä¶

Service was not good and really slow (30 min+ to become the dishes)"
46,The Mexican, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great food. Enough quantity. Tasty.
Highly recommended."
47,The Mexican, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a cozy little place with a nice atmosphere, friendly service and quite fun interior. However, it‚Äôs not the best Mexican food you can find I must say. The dishes here are closer to fast food but tasty nevertheless. I quite like the chicken burritos. I do find the food a little over priced for its quality though."
48,The Mexican, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very nice food and good atmosphere
49,The Mexican, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Very plain. No mexican spicies and overall flavorless. Nice staff though!
50,The Mexican, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was very  delicious. Good price, nice personnel and location. Fajitas was huge and incredibly tasty. Good Sangria. I highly suggest visiting this place even if you're not a fan of Mexican food."
51,The Mexican, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The place is run on a shoe string budget. The diet cola tasted cheep and watered down as did the house wine. The steak wasn't edible. Literally couldn't chew it. The waiter didn't ask how everything was, as we commenced or meal, it was ‚Ä¶"
52,The Mexican, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you're in Amsterdam then this place is a must try atleast once for a meal.
This was the best mexcian restaurant I visited in a very very long time. Place is pretty tiny and have a limited space with ambiance light and a continuous ‚Ä¶"
53,The Mexican, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was delicious. Only downside is that due to the open kitchen, your clothes soak up the smell of the cooking so you smell like a chip pan when you leave. So not the best if you're going straight out afterwards!"
54,The Mexican, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"The food was tasty, but it took quite long. Besides we had a really small table near the door and the staff always stood in the door and didn't close the door, so we were freezing inside. Not really nice when you want to enjoy your food. ‚Ä¶"
55,The Mexican, 2 stars ,a month ago,Typical tourist restaurant on dam Square
56,The Mexican, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food was really good. I tried slot of Mexican restaurants and this is one of the best I had. Should went for the rice with my meal. Staff were quick and efficient. Prices are okay too.
57,The Mexican, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"We had fish & chips and a plate of nachos. It was okay, not bad but not amazing either. Nice waitress to welcome us from outside and make sure we go in. It definitely satisfied the munchies but I wouldn't say it was fresh."
58,The Mexican, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Should be called 'the fake Mexican'.
The worst attempt of simple nachos I have had ever.
I get there's different ways to have made the recipe westernized...but.. ‚Ä¶"
59,The Mexican, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Almost same taste like real Mexican foods. I would suggest this small cantina Mexicano.

61,The Mexican, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Big dishes with combination options for two or more guests. Service was great. Prices are decent.The location helps making it a
really nice place to grab something to eat before or after hanging around at the city center's."
62,The Mexican, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Authentic Mexican Restaurant based on American perspective. Has all the standard dishes including tacos and quesadillas. Good service, no problems. Sangria pitchers are great value."
63,The Mexican, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We ordered the vegetarian quesadilla, which was extremely flavorless and was filled with random vegetables like green beans, carrots and peas with absolutely no seasoning. We did not eat the dish and when the man who took our order came by ‚Ä¶"
64,The Mexican, 1 star ,3 years ago,I was coming aften to eat here the employees were always friendly and the food is nice. But this time we had me and my friend a very rude guy with glasses working there start behaving like we are not welcome. Whene I ask him to act nicer to ‚Ä¶

67,The Mexican, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Very unfriendly and no good food either!

68,The Mexican, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Was not expecting much coming in, as we were not expecting to eat Mexican food in Europe. Must say we were very impressed by the taste. Good place to try if you looking to try something different."
69,The Mexican, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic food! Really close to the real thing. The setting of the place is very good also. Completely recommended, and the lunch menu is very convenient also! #traditional #mexican #cheap"
70,The Mexican, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was food, but growing up in San Diego CA, this is NOT authentic Mexican food. The queso dip was cold and did not come with anything. I had to order chips separately. The Mexican rice was white rice with a little seasoning...don‚Äôt waste your time."
71,The Mexican, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Enjoying crowded street of Amsterdam on Saturday, saw this hotel .. Belive me before tht i never tried any mexican hotel and reason is to have spicy food as i was bored with European food.. So decided to test mexican. I ordered starter - ‚Ä¶"

74,The Mexican, 4 stars ,3 years ago,It was very tasty and a lot!
75,The Mexican, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Great food, great and friendly service. Fair price, lots of food. Ordered a burrito with extra beans on the side, they forgot them, after the meal and prior to my asking they apologized and said they would remove it from the bill. I 100% recommend this place."
76,The Mexican, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food isn't actually Mexican. It's tasty, but it is not spiced or seasoned like typical / authentic Mexican food. It's a commercialized version of the idea of what Mexican food is. Only reason for 2 starts is friendly service, and  and quick"
77,The Mexican, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good size portions of lovely Mexican nosh. Not overly spicy. Nice cozy atmosphere too which was surprising given the location.
78,The Mexican, 4 stars ,4 years ago,A two storey place with some really good food . The chorizos were the highlight for me . Some Dutch and Mexican beers on the menu go perfectly with the food here . The friendly staff and chilled atmosphere make it tick all the boxes.
79,The Mexican, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Phenomenal Mexican food served! I loved the chicken burrito and the hot chocolate was perfect. Definitely a cute lunch or dinner spot for very affordable prices.
80,The Mexican, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was very good, and the people serving are very friendly and open to help you. Cute, cozy place to eat and looking over what's happening on the busy street."
81,The Mexican, 1 star ,3 years ago,"A terrible excuse for Mexican food! The salsa tasted like they put ketchup in it, the rice was clearly microwaved and arrived cold, and to top it off the fajitas had CELERY in it and tasted like curry. Some kind of Indian/Mexican fusion that should not exist. If you are called The Mexican just stick to the script."

Busy and crammed. Waitress rushed off her feet, took 15 mins for drinks and the ‚Ä¶"

84,The Mexican, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food was ok but very expensive for what it was. Place is small and music was kinda dance top 50 or so. Staff was very friendly but not well organized.
85,The Mexican, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Had the chicken soup on a really chilly evening. Warmed up all the way to the soul!! Chicken wings were very good as well. Good price.
86,The Mexican, 3 stars ,8 years ago,Only having the English breakfast (‚Ç¨7.5)I can say that The food is pretty good and at a reasonable price however you don't get a lot. The staff are more than friendly and the decor is good

88,The Mexican, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Having been seated, waited for food, got told to move to make room for other fit guests who could have gone to upstairs seating. Food not great enough to excuse rudeness"
