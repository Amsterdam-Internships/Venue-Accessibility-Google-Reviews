0,Bitterzoet, 1 star ,a month ago,"We were treated unbelievable rude. The bartender was screaming behind the bar, she couldn't handle the crowd. We waited for 20 min, then she ran from behind the bar to scream in our face (while spitting in our face) and accused us …"
1,Bitterzoet, 2 stars ,2 years ago,We thought we would be able to see our friends band after pre-purchasing tickets.  We didn't realize that you need to wait in line for an hour to ensure that you can see the band.  We ended up sitting upstairs on the couch drinking and …
2,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a great little venue. This place has some great soul and a great feeling. I'm not sure there is a bad spot in the place to see a show.
3,Bitterzoet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I went to the disco which is located downstairs. It was a cool disco with good selection of R&B songs! Dance floor is a bit small, bathrooms are okay (for a disco), lockers cost 2 euro, there is a smoking room and two old game consoles upstairs! If you like R&B then definitely give it a try!"
4,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A definite dive bar atmosphere with toilets the like of which I've only experienced in some rough bars in New Orleans. Still all of this adds to the atmosphere and the stained glass windows are s nice touch. Door staff were friendly and helpful.
5,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It probably depends on who is performing but I went to the BBQ party with some friends and it was a great time. The crowd is definitely young to mid 20s. Drinks were priced relatively well. Dancing was great. Smoke room upstairs. The vibe …
6,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice venue  that ain't too big. Tickets here are quite cheap and the smoking room is quite fancy and with nice lounge chairs.
7,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice and cozy small stage...
Great place to see your favourite band."
8,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, gorgeous friendly staff, from the doorkeeper, the entry up to the bar no one could have been more friendly ! *****"
9,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best rnb and hiphop club in Amsterdam. I think the setup here is a lot better than Melkweg! If you love drake, kendrick, and old classics like biggie, then you must hit this club."
10,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best clubs in Amsterdam. Since the venue is small the concerts are always very cosy and intimate.
11,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome music hall! Great acts in an intimate atmosphere and hip location. Clear sound system and crazy light show. Not too loud but enough to feel the beat. Good drink selection and fair prices. Lockers included for 2€. Highly recommendable!
12,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice and small venue with a hearty atmosphere. Very close to centraal station so it's easy to get there.
13,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice bar, great venue. Saw Paul Kelly here. Worth checking out. If only for the naughty stained glass!"
14,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love it here! I only come to bitterzoet for hip hop nights, but its great :) the staff is friendly and the music is good. Clean and big smoking area with really good couches. The only point of improvement might be the glasses; some of …"

18,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A brilliant place with a good atmosphere and people who like to get down more so than in most places around Amsterdam. Probably a better venue for hip-hop and urban music type of nights than for house music. …
19,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cozy venue, very friendly staff and has large smoking room."
20,Bitterzoet, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"A nice place where you can have different experience every night it's open.

21,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,went to see Naaz twice in Bitterzoet. it's a small venue with lot's of places to stand on different heights. I'm not very tall so it was great to be able to stand on the little platform in the bag so I could still see everything. I did feel like there were more people than the venue should be able to admit
22,Bitterzoet, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The bouncer is the best part of this place. Nice guy. Small inside with a smell of sweat and red bull, the bright lights make it feel like they've forgotten its a club. Music was OK, but there are plenty of better clubs in the dam."
23,Bitterzoet, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I tried to get in here, the bouncer wouldn't let me in - maybe because I was solo. Anyway the vibe I got from people in line was students from Netherlands who got drunk for first time in their life - I'm not sure I would enjoy the club …"
24,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing club. Visited with some friends and there was a hip hop and rnb night. Great atmosphere.
The only bad thing was the security man on the front door was quite rude.
Definitely going back again when in Amsterdam."
25,Bitterzoet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool music (urban, hip hop, everything with a nice rhythm). Quite nice crowd, not too touristy. But something was off. You don't feel quite comfortable either dancing, sitting in the couch or in the bar. Interesting windows etc, makes for a nice mystory."
26,Bitterzoet, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great club, had a real nice out here! Club is small but really nice and sound is great!"
27,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best rnb, hiphop, reggae, dancehall and overall urban music place in Amsterdam. Very good on Friday nights and Saturday night. Also good when the occasional artist performing. Tip: don’t arrive before 12am. The club gets jumping later in the night."
28,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The first time I visited Bitterzoet was because a cozy concert was held here. It was downstairs. The club area, I believe! Staff was nice. I had to exchange some (coin) money for the lockers. I wish somebody had told me that beforehand tho! All in all, the experience was lovely. So no regrets!"
29,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing time seeing Lucy Rose. Fantastic venue, fairly small but made for a great atmosphere"
30,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Small and cozy venue. Sometimes they have great bands/artists playing, which makes it perfect to see them really close. The drinks at the bar are at a reasonable price, and the staff is friendly and quick."
31,Bitterzoet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's a nice venue for concerts, close to Amsterdam Centraal aND they have a photobooth and really cool decor, but the toilets are not the cleanest so that's why I'm deducting a point. They look cool tho!"
32,Bitterzoet, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Staff was extremely rude. We weren't told there was a cover charge at the door, so we went inside to discover that there was a cover. It was pretty early in the night (about 11pm) so our group was hesitant to start the night there. The guy …"
33,Bitterzoet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I went here to see Shannon and the Clams. The venue is quite nice and has a church like interior. But with a bar of course. Prices for drinks are reasonable. It can be quite warm inside though.
34,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I can assure you that this is one of the ""good"" clubs in amsterdam even though it's a bit smaller than others like AIR or Club Up. The vibe is always amazing. The staff works hard to keep the place tidy the entire night and the music is always on point."
35,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome place! Amazing music, friendly staff, average-priced drinks, great location. Would highly recommend to any visitor looking for a great time!! We had an absolute blast and will definitely be back!"

40,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Dojacat was on performance and she was good!! Nice place and close to da stage
41,Bitterzoet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Intimite club experience, you'll get very close to the artist like he/she is playing at your house. Sound is also very nice, but the bar personnel is a bit slow for my liking. Overal still a good experience though."
42,Bitterzoet, 1 star ,3 years ago,Good music but thats it. The bouncer told us that he hates tourist‘s and we are just lucky to get in on this night(bc it was really empty so he just thought about the money we would bring) …
43,Bitterzoet, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A small and really fun place to party. The staff is very friendly and the whole venue feels ""cozy"". It's also very close (walking distance) to Amsterdam central Station."
44,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We went on a weekend night and the vibe was good for the whole night. It was a €30 entrance fee for a guy and a girl which I thought a little steep, and the locker room space / bathroom is a little uninviting, but the music soon made that …"
45,Bitterzoet, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The party was good, but the place is really expensive. The security guy took 1 liter whisky from us and he told like we will get back when we leave the bar. Nope. He didn't give back!"
46,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Great club, with a nice diverse program. On my visit to Amsterdam last week I've been there a few times, and the club always surprised me. We stumbled upon the place in the center of amsterdam looking for a good party. We entered the club …"
47,Bitterzoet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great club with super polite staff. It's very small though, not much chance to catch a glimpse to the stage. There were around 150 people and it was already cramped."
48,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Probably one of my favourite small gig and club night venues in Amsterdam, saw Dan let Sac vs Scroobius Pip as well as John Cooper Clarke and both were ace. Nice upstairs balcony too for when it gets a bit too crowded."
49,Bitterzoet, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Great club, went on the Friday night that one of the club's resident DJ had returned from maternity leave. The club had a great atmosphere. The DJ played an eclectic set, from bro step to indie. I was a bit disappointed not to see more mixing. Most of the time they appeared to be just sticking CDs on."
50,Bitterzoet, 1 star ,3 years ago,"*AVOID* *AVOID* *AVOID*
The doorman was very rude and unprofessional. The club night clearly stated tickets could be purchased at the door so we turn up really looking forward to a …"

52,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cool club with hiphop, drum and bass, rnb vibe. They got divine stained glasses decoration with naughty scenes that make you feel like in a church. They remade the smoking room recently, although this is still a stifling space where …"

58,Bitterzoet, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good venue, small and comparable to the underworld in Camden. However limited view due to pillars and the genetic make up of Dutch people being unnaturally tall, and I am 6 foot 1."
59,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Small capacity venue with great curation in collaboration with Paradiso. Love hat concerts are there, as the size gives the gigs a more intimate atmosphere."
60,Bitterzoet, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"I went to Amsterdam with my wife for a city trip and we decided to see HAIM at Bitterzoet. We didn't have tickets for this sold out show, but managed to get some for face value outside. We were a bit worried by some of the bad reviews we've …"

65,Bitterzoet, 2 stars ,9 years ago,My wife and I paid 120 euro for the all-inclusive on New Years and were refused reentry after we left to get a bite to eat because they didn't have any food inside. Bouncer refused to let us speak to a manager and offered no refund. I wish I knew how to file a complaint with the Dutch Better Business Bureau. FOREIGNERS BEWARE!!!
