It has a sausage wrapped in cheese then meat, laid on bacon, and covered with sauerkraut and sause. Really good and very filling. My wife had the cheeseburger and said that it was very good as well. The meat was not over cooked and the vegetables were tasty."
1,Food Crib, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"foodcrib is a outdoor food stand at Museumplein where you can buy burgers, hotdogs, salads, ice-creams and other fast foods at reasonable prices. There is a covered outdoor seating area or you can take your orders to go. ‚Ä¶"
2,Food Crib, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The moccha and the cakes are awesome. We went there every morning to get our coffee :) highly recommended üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
3,Food Crib, 5 stars ,6 months ago,AMAZING vegan burger and amazing family run service. Highly highly recommend!!!
4,Food Crib, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is amazing! The energy is just so refreshing and the owners are down to earth and treat everyone like an old friend.  We couldn't stay away from this place! We were probably the most demanding (read annoying) customers of the day ‚Ä¶
5,Food Crib, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"One of the worst hotdogs
The sausage was not good"
6,Food Crib, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I‚Äôve ordered ‚Äúchubby hotdog‚Äù, it‚Äôs the best hotdog i ever had before. The bread is crispy outside, soft and sticky inside. Sausage is perfect. The combination of bread sausage cheese and bacon is well balance and i love the fries onion very much."
7,Food Crib, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Perfect for getting a quick lunch after the Rijksmuseum.
The vegan hemp burger was amazing, definitely recommended. The line went reasonably fast despite being sort of long, and the staff all seemed pleasant. Free crispy opinions as well, which were a good addition to the hemp burger! :-)"
8,Food Crib, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"had the veggie burger, but it was disappointing - the bread was too tough, and the guacamole overpowered the flavour of the beetroot patty. The hot chocolate was quite good tho! One good point of this shop is it‚Äôs very convenient location, right in between Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum"
9,Food Crib, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place! The staff was nice! I ordered a basic hotdog, the bread was tasty but also the sausage! You can eat for cheap!"
10,Food Crib, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food well taken care of. Good sausages, great bread. Staff friendly. Prices ok for such good products, way better than the average hot dog you get around the corner"
11,Food Crib, 5 stars ,2 years ago,my partner and I stopped here very quickly before going an event in Amsterdam. He had a hotdog which was great but I went for the boring option of a tuna and cheese melt and omg. It was amazing. The bread was so yummy and it was HUGE!! I ‚Ä¶
12,Food Crib, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Their claim to fame, The Junkyard Dog, was a party in my stomach!  There are a vast array of burgers, dogs, brats, and refreshments.   It gets the job done when you've been touring museums all morning and looking for a quick bite."
13,Food Crib, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I'd recommend this food cart outside the rijksmuseum. I had a hemp vegan burger and it was delicious. They have free sauerkraut  and crispy onions and a short waiting time. There's also seating overlooking the museum square.
14,Food Crib, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good food. Awesome service. Fast and delicious.
15,Food Crib, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best street food in long time. Bread is warm and crispy,  food is just right!"

19,Food Crib, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"A solid street food.
It is being served quickly and has it's own, specific taste, which is ok ;)
The only (and huge) problem are pigeons! ‚Ä¶"
20,Food Crib, 1 star ,a year ago,Poor quality meat in the burgers. McDonald's is better than this. Only the looks and the seating area are good.
21,Food Crib, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Not the cheapest, but location is perfect and to be honest the Junkyard dog was pretty good (though the sausage wasn‚Äôt quite heated through)"
22,Food Crib, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good location near the museum! Hotdogs and burgers are amazing and the staff are so lovely. Try the sloppy sauce hotdogs or burgers, they're just amazing and prices are good too!"
23,Food Crib, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great location... Love the urban style it has... Had two delicious cheeseburgers (5,5‚Ç¨)... Could have something more to make it more value for money (e.g. potatos)..."
24,Food Crib, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place for having lunch outside, but better choose a warm day. Cheap and very nice stuff. Perfect place to eat after a whole morning visiting museums."
25,Food Crib, 1 star ,a year ago,Soggy bun and too salty burger. The burger was microwaved. Well Big Mac seems to be much better.
