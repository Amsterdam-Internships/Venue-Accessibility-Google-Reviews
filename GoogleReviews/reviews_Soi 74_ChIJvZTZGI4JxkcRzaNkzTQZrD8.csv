0,Soi 74, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Great ambiance and interior. Felt a bit like home. Food was okay though. Bites + soup tasted fine (But 5euro for one Sausage though?) Curry however... The pineapple in the red curry got me very puzzled. The pineapple overpowered the curry …
1,Soi 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Thai backpacker style bar. This place is fun, doesn't take anything too seriously and serves good curries and thai street food snacks. Nice deals on drinks including Chang beer. …"
2,Soi 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent food, excellent beer, good music & cheap what more could you want."
3,Soi 74, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Small menu but reasonably priced. Really cosy atmosphere with pretty lights and very green looking. All the curries were vegan and you have a choice of adding rice or noodles and meat/tempeh, friend had the pad Thai which looked really good too. Fast service, would definitely go back. The green curry was lovely, but rather small portions"
4,Soi 74, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"It’s a nice place, pretty cosy and it has a great lighting environment. Food is meh, maybe missing some originality but for a drink with some friends and sharing bites it’s enough !"
5,Soi 74, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice, tidy dining room. Friendly staff who understood English. The starters, we had the platter and ribs and the soup. All delicious and tasty. The mains we had Thai green curry with chicken. 7/10. And one veggie curry which tasted more Indian than Thai. 5/10."
6,Soi 74, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"nice interior, very chill and hip with tap beer and counter bar, but i’d say the food is not so authentic, mild taste curry. I got red curry and there’s pineapple in it which is strange, my friend had green curry was ok. satay was good with …"
7,Soi 74, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I genuinely seem to recognize some of those flavors that only Thai cuisine offers. Together with the good atmosphere and friendly staff, this makes for a good place to eat. Starter was excellent (plate of all), main dish was somewhat simple and small portion."
8,Soi 74, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Main dishes might seem tiny, however they fill up well. The curries are delicious, as are the cocktails. Fast servings and pleasant staff, had a great time at an affordable price. …"
9,Soi 74, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The red curry was great. I haven’t tried tempeh ever before but it was fantastic. If you don’t like cilantro make sure to ask if it is on your dish, because they add it on everything while it is not in the menu ingredients."
10,Soi 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Top curries, as spicy and delicious as the curries I had Thailand! Lekker! Instagram @athletic_andres"
11,Soi 74, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Little Thailand in Amsterdam

12,Soi 74, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The best part about Soi 74 is the incredibly nice and helpful staff. There is good potential, but the food was bland and uninteresting. Green curry was tasty, but severely lacked key ingredients. If I hadn’t upgraded to shrimp, the …"
13,Soi 74, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Oof, this food is below average. Ordered a pad Thai that was way too sour. Got a massaman curry instead which was small and ok, no chicken or tofu, just a small bowl of spicy sauce with bits of soft potato. The meatballs were quite dry and …"
14,Soi 74, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I got extremely sick after coming to this restaurant last Saturday. We waited pretty much two hours. My rice was cold when I got my dish. After a few hours I started to feel bad, and I am really sick since then. My friend finished my rice …"
15,Soi 74, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ended up in this restaurant via Social Deal, 4 courses for 15,95. You can’t expect too much then; however I would recommend to spend your money elsewhere. I ordered naan with mango chutney but got naan with Chili sauce instead after a very …"
16,Soi 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A cosy and relaxing bar and restaurant. Very friendly staff. The food is really good and authentic. I don't know why just simple jasmine rice can be cooked so well!! And the tom yum soup is so tasty.
17,Soi 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We loved Soi 74! Great food and a really great atmosphere! The food was fresh and tasty and healthy. There was a good selection of drinks including fresh mint tea and green tea and a yummy ""Dutch Mule"" with vodka and ginger. Everyone was …"
18,Soi 74, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is correct, prices are ok. Serve was perfect."
19,Soi 74, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Clearly stated I wanted a prawn green curry. Prawns got forgotten and when I asked the waitress, she offered no apology whatsoever and brought out some MICROWAVED prawns in a seperate bowl!!!!! Unacceptable service and she remained rude up …"
20,Soi 74, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Was excited to try this place. Got there with two friends and were seated at the bar to have a drink before we were able to get a table. The service was very slow. Once our order was taken (20+ minutes after we got to the restaurant) we were told they were out of Pad Thai. It was only 7pm.
21,Soi 74, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Had take away food here, green curry. smelled a bit strange, and has a slightly bitter aftertaste. Other than the spicyness I can't detect much Thai about it. Then the portion was quite small as well. Not too happy about the food overall."
22,Soi 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This fusion thai place is in the middle between restaurant and bar. In there, everhone was drinking thai beers. Meals are served quickly and delicious. The design of the place is incredible. I had the most amazing spicy brownie and a really really good espresso. Quite unique concept."
23,Soi 74, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Bizarre experience foodwise. Red curry was made with butter instead of coconut milk. Second visit: pad krapau (krapau = basil) served without any basil. Whoever is behind the stove.. wow what the hell.
Come for the vibe, not the food."
24,Soi 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Having dinner with friends, makes dining even more enjoyable. For me as a spiced up person, the food I had, could have been more spicy. Adding a spice table/indicator, could add to the spicy/non-spicy choosing."
25,Soi 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had a three course dinner for just 15 euros, the green & red curry we had were full of flavour and we had our favourite sticky rice with mango!! Fast and professional service, thank you!"
26,Soi 74, 1 star ,3 years ago,"That ain't Thai food. Pad Thai is the most common easy street food you can get in Thailand. It's a shame they call a plate of dry tasteless noodles pad Thai. I wouldn't go there for 'authentic' Thai food, go to places where Thai people actually cook it."
27,Soi 74, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very disappointed in this place. It smells delicious but my friends and my food (papaya salad, pad king and pad thai) barely tasted like anything. This is a nice place to sit and have a drink, even though service is quite slow. However, I would unfortunately not recommend the food :("
28,Soi 74, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The food was terrible and it had no flavor. We asked if we could have some salt and were told that they have none... The staff was friendly and the service was genuinely good but we waited around an hour for our food. So I think it’s fun hanging out there and having a drink but I wouldn’t recommend eating there.
29,Soi 74, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I loved this place when i was there! You can taste those thai flavours that bring you back to Thailand. It is cozy and the staff really nice. Hope to come back soon :)
30,Soi 74, 1 star ,3 years ago,Poor service and poor food! I am sorry for the girls front door but I have been in Thailand and that was an Albert Hein version of a worst that curry! On top of it I was asked if I wanted to have my dessert take away...after1h30m. Not nice
31,Soi 74, 1 star ,3 years ago,The worst experience in Amsterdam. We have waited 1 hour for our meal and didnt even get it because we had a plane to catch so we had to leave. Really do not recommend at all. Hungry and angry.
32,Soi 74, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good prices for decent Thai food, the menu is simple. Not 5 stars due to them forgetting my friends order."
33,Soi 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Always as good as the first time and always worth a visit. Me and my friend have been here 3 years on the trot now. Excellent food lovely atmosphere great value for money
34,Soi 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty pad thai for a good price (considering amsterdam). The staff is nice and the place is also very cool to hang out! oh, and they have singha :)"
35,Soi 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious Thai street food and great value. The service is also very good. Definitely try it out.
36,Soi 74, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Everything seemed to go and be wrong last night regarding delivery and quality of food, but the owner has promised to make it up to me. I'll write an updated review of the same order next week!"
37,Soi 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Go here if you miss the type of food you find on every corner in Bangkok. Reasonably priced and friendly people.
38,Soi 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, awesome atmosphere, really recommend! I had the coconut soup :)"
39,Soi 74, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Really rubbish microwave meal, was even cold in the middle! Would be OK for drinks but would avoid for food."

41,Soi 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great little bar serving really good food, good atmosphere and friendly, helpful staff."
42,Soi 74, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Okay if you want to wait an hour for a bowl of rice and chicken and cocount milk plus waitress was super RUDE. Too bad  , bad service."
43,Soi 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Good curry's! Can get quite busy so make sure you arrive early
44,Soi 74, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Not sure who would consider the food at this place Thai. Somebody who has never had Thai food, maybe."
45,Soi 74, 1 star ,3 years ago,"very bad, the pad thai is just some tasteless spaghetti, nothing like pad thai. dont do it!!!"
