1,Amore, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"This place was all around a great experience! The food was amazing from start to finish and the service is next level. Not only is the staff friendly, attentive and have a great vibe but Professor Giovanni made everything much more special. I loved everything about my dinner. I will definitely be coming back"
2,Amore, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Restaurants are usually defined by how good the food is. While the food at Amore e Amore is outstanding, the feeling you get when arriving makes you feel like you are a part of a secret family that you would never want to leave. ‚Ä¶"
3,Amore, 5 stars ,a month ago,This is a hidden gem of a restaurant. This family owned restaurant will go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and leave you feeling satisfied! The ambiance is so exciting as they decorate for each holiday. The service is top notch - ‚Ä¶
4,Amore, 5 stars ,a month ago,"One of the best dinners I‚Äôve had ever! If you want Italian in Atlanta, this is your place. We are vegetarians and they happily accommodated to diet. They made my husband the most delicious vegetable primavera. Also, try the cart of goods ‚Ä¶"
5,Amore, 5 stars ,a month ago,"This is our go-to for celebration dinners. The food is exceptional! Don't miss the lobster bisque ... and share it, as you'll want room for everything else! Their lobster ravioli and vodka gnocchi are our favorites and should not be missed. ‚Ä¶"
6,Amore, 5 stars ,a month ago,"If I could give Amore e Amore more stars I would!
Hands down perfection; the service, the atmosphere, the food, the drinks... simply amazing. I felt like close family/friends immediately. I have told everyone about Amore e Amore. I will definitely be back. Can't recommend enough."

8,Amore, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great Italian restaurant. Super unique atmosphere and a lot of fun (disco music and party hats). You will not leave hungry, lots of amazing food. The owners are there to greet you and ensure you have a great experience."
9,Amore, 5 stars ,2 months ago,So glad they are still there. Such a fun place and the food is amazing. The owners are one of a kind!
10,Amore, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"I always thought St. Cecilia was the best Italian place in town, but after going to Amore e Amore twice now, I firmly put Amore e Amore as the best Italian restaurant in Atlanta and perhaps the whole Southeast. We love the old school vibe, ‚Ä¶"
11,Amore, 5 stars ,a month ago,Always amazing mama gale and prof gio are like family and the best lobster bisque in the city
12,Amore, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"We came here for a date night, and our 7-week-old tagged along. We were escorted to a quiet(er), private little area in the back. It was perfect! Baby slept, and we got to enjoy a lovely evening out. The food was excellent, but the service ‚Ä¶"
13,Amore, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We were lucky enough to find this incredible restaurant during our trip to Atlanta.  From the moment you walk in the door, you will realize that the restaurant is a special place.  The atmosphere is one that transports you to straight to a ‚Ä¶"

16,Amore, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Loved it. We didn't have a reservation. Hostess let us in. Excellent food and service. Loved the little old man that came to our table and made us laugh.
17,Amore, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"An incredible experience from start to finish! Hands down the best Italian food in Atlanta. Start with the crusty bread with garlic butter, the fresh parmigiano, and the Arugula salad with burrata. The Eggplant Parmigiana is the best I've ‚Ä¶"
18,Amore, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I always have a great time here. The food is impeccable that's probably what people care about, but the best thing about Amore e Amore is the vibe. It's always pleasant and lively, and the staff make it such an enjoyable experience. ‚Ä¶"
19,Amore, 5 stars ,4 months ago,This is one of the loveliest restaurants in Atlanta. Food is really good too. I‚Äôm giving 5 stars altho customer service isn‚Äôt all that great. Everything else is so above average tho. Sea Bass is delicious as is the very traditional cheese cake.
20,Amore, 1 star ,3 months ago,They are unable to split checks for whatever reason. I forgot it‚Äôs 1970. They also did not tell us that auto gratuity was included so our party all tipped extra for an undeserving experience. The food was average and overpriced. Cut the ‚Ä¶
21,Amore, 1 star ,4 months ago,"I loved the atmosphere, glass bottle water, & bread. But the wait staff was rude. Me and my friend decided to go else where after the appetizer. Couldn‚Äôt even tell who our server was and everyone ignored us. When we asked for the check. The server had an attitude and gave a smart remark. Would never ever go back."
22,Amore, 5 stars ,a month ago,"This place feels like home!! The best service, the best authentic food, and the best atmosphere. By far my favorite Italian in Atlanta. You must go!!!"

25,Amore, 5 stars ,6 months ago,If you‚Äôre looking for GREAT Italian food - this is the place. I don‚Äôt know who the Miller‚Äôs are but they have their own pasta dish named after them and it is amazing. My daughter had the lobster ravioli and she said it was perfect. We will be back!!!
26,Amore, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"The minute my daughter and I walked in we were treated like family. The food, the atmosphere, the service, the staff... phenomenal. We had such a good time. This restaurant should be on everyone's ""to do"" list if in Atlanta. Love, love, love this place!!!"

29,Amore, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"There is not a better Italian restaurant in all of Atlanta. The food, the environment, & especially the love you receive from Professor Giovanni & Mama Gale is second to none. If you are looking for the best place for dinner in all of Georgia, go to Amore e Amore."
30,Amore, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Service and food are both AMAZING!  Can't recommend enough!  Wife actually asked if we could come back the next 3 nights in a row to try more things :)
31,Amore, 5 stars ,a month ago,Fantastic food and excellent service. Our waiter was very attentive and thoughtful. Will go again.
32,Amore, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Overpriced entries. Entrees very bland and not worth the price. Need better Chef.  Very tight spot, which can be quite uncomfortable. Not a child friendly environment. Owners and staff very pleasant though!! Only one check issued per group. Not too pleased we weren't advised before orders were taken."
33,Amore, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Cutest restaurant I have been to in Atlanta. Great food and cocktails! The restaurant decor is so unique and quirky too. I highly recommend Amore e Amore.

41,Amore, 5 stars ,8 months ago,This is our favorite Italian restaurant.  Really glad they opened back up.  Highly recommend for those looking for a quality meal and entertaining night.
42,Amore, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Bizarre energy in this restaurant. One example: They have a smoke machine that they blasted right on to a table and the women were literally waving fog out of their faces and away from their plates. At the heart of it though, Prices were way too high for portions and quality."
43,Amore, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Great restaurant!!!Bought so much things! One problem none of the employees spoke French to my kids. Very disappointed but my kids loved it, we drank some beer and had fun."
44,Amore, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The absolute best Italian experience anyone could ask for! Loved it, great food and atmosphere can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
45,Amore, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Still a staple of Atlanta. The food and family style service made it feel like home. Get the canoli!!!
