1,Bar Mowgli, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Different to the standard Dutch bistro menu which is nice for a change. Friendly people working there, who showed me a new drink I hadn't had before. They have several types of cider, quite sweet. Really liked how it was decorated. Very relaxed and not too loud.lots of space between tables."

12,Bar Mowgli, 4 stars ,5 years ago,(Translated by Google) I went here with 3 other friends to eat with a groupon choice menu. There was still enough choice. I had the sticky ribs beforehand and as main menu rice with duck and sweet soy sauce. The food was great. Wait staff ‚Ä¶
13,Bar Mowgli, 4 stars ,4 years ago,(Translated by Google) Nice bar and nice lunch. Cozy inside and a nice atmosphere. The tomato soup with bell pepper was spicy and I think this was a mistake. Fortunately we can withstand spicy food. ‚Ä¶
