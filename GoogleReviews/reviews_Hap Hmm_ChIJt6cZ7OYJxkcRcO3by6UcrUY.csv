2,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"The beef stew is phenomenal, the atmosphere is that of a small family run establishment that's been around a while (not in a bad way necessarily), the service is good and the prices are too. Friendly staff and great food, all I'm really looking for. You can't go wrong with Hap Hmm!"
3,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,a month ago,Good service and delicious dutch food with a simple but comfortable atmosphere. Very affordable prices as well considering it is in central Amsterdam.
4,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"We came here for our thanksgiving dinner for a change of pace. It was a fantastic location, the food was amazing the prices were extremely reasonable. We had appetizers, main courses, and desert for 6 and it was still only about €100!!!! …"
5,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Such a lovely place! Extremely nice service, comfy interior, very cheap and good food! The food might not look delicious (since it’s mostly boiled vegetables etc) but don’t let that fool you. I think our group liked the beef stew, liver and …"
6,Hap Hmm, 3 stars ,5 months ago,You can eat authentic dutch food here. The food is good but nothing special. The service was good. The restaurant is quite small and especially at the windows the next table is less than 50cm besides you. The restaurant was full and there …

8,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 years ago,It is a cozy place with a nice decoration. Their dishes are simple and very tasty. The craft beer was delicious. We were greeted very kindly.

9,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing service and great food, we had 2x of the soup of the day (chicken soup) and also a crayfish salad for starters. …"
10,Hap Hmm, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,"They made a mistake and added €10 off of my check.
Thankfully, I'm good at math and know that €7+€10 doesn't equal €27.
The dinner wasn't that good."
11,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent food, good service and decent atmosphere. The staff is quite good and give you space to talk among yourself. I recommend the rabbit plate for your entree and the pudding for your dessert. A good restaurant that has does have a …"

Somewhat out of the way, definitely out of the mainstream, completely unassuming and un-self conscious, and oh so good! …"
17,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing classic Dutch food. Our 3rd time here. Schnitzel with stroganoff sauce is fantastic. Boiled potatoes are waxy and not overdone. Brussels are fantastic. Cabbage and carrot are to die for!!! Absolutely fantastic food! Reasonably …
18,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I really liked this restaurant, it is cosy, it is clean, fast service, delicious food of course.

20,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really busy place with local Dutch food. I wanted to try stamppot and famous pea soup, but they told me that its winter dishes. I had a Dutch shrimp salad and house wine. Place is small and not expensive, lots of locals come to dine there."
21,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to try out local food for lower price. The food is okay, but not stunning. Tiny place, and we had to sit with strangers to have somewhere to sit. Stressed, but friendly waitors."
22,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Wanted to try traditional Dutch food on our last evening in the Netherlands, we were happy to visit this place on a Public Holidays eve at 6pm with no reservations. Service was prompt and courteous. Main courses of stewed beef and Grandma's …"
23,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I don't think I would ever find out about this place if local friend didn't take me here. Good that she did! Perfect place to experience local cuisine. It's like someone took me home for a lunch. There is no thing that would make you feel …

29,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Well, this is a real find! It's like walking into your grandma's house for some fine home cooking!!!

31,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"What a lovely experience!
The service in this place reminds me of those taverns or local-family (economical places) from Spain, Portugal or Argentina. It's clearly a family-run …"
32,Hap Hmm, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Visited this restaurant as it had good reviews. Starting to think these reviews are fake. I was served by two waitresses, both were cold and unfriendly . Service was terrible and the waitresses hardly paid attention to our table. One of …"

39,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Its a great place where you can eat local food done wright. Family enviroment, good prices and welcoming staff. Try the meatball or sausage stamppot."
40,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Quaint and unique little restaurant that locals and tourists go to for authentic Dutch cuisine - it's a neat place with great food!
41,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious and very inviting, cozy atmosphere with charming personality. The beer chicken is very juicy and rich and all the veggies we're very well cooked."
42,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Typical Dutch restaurant where you can taste the real ""homemade"" cuisine of the place, to try absolutely."
43,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We were cold and tired so canceled our reservations across town and decided to try this place based on the reviews and convenient location near our hotel. I consider this basic Dutch food, tasty and very reasonably priced (we paid more for …"

45,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Excellent food and atmosphere. Very authentic and very reasonable prices.
46,Hap Hmm, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Not quite sure what the fuss is about. The service was welcoming and attentive, and the place felt authentic, in a very old fashioned sense. The food was also old fashioned (as in boiling the vegetables to death sort of old fashioned). The …"
47,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very good local food and great service. Well worth a try if you want Dutch food well made.
48,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Soooooo good!   We came early and was able to get a seat in the limited seating restaurant.  They don't take reservations.   So far this place is our favorite since we arrived in Amsterdam.   Cute, clean, good quality food and friendly …"
49,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow, so tasty!! As good as all the reviews said. Real comfort food in a cozy little restaurant. They do take card but only certain types so bring cash too if you’re a foreigner. …"
50,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place was simply awesome! My friend and I ordered stewed beef and grandmother meatballs as main courses. Both the dishes were featured with veggies and cooked potatoes also really delicious. The owner and the staff were really nice and …
51,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My friend and I had a dinner here at Friday night and the only comment I could say is that you must give it a try. I had a pork chop, which is really tasty and tender. Finished up with a eggnock dessert, which is fantastic and worthy to …"
52,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very cosy and homely restaurant! Had a great time here; pork chop was great 👍🏻
53,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good homely food at a reasonable price. Ordered the beef stew and Grandmothers meatball (yes, it was one giant meatball). Really good friendly service. Their stew had ran out by 8.30pm when I went, so it'd be good to drop by a little earlier if you wanna try that :)"
54,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice to have a restaurant with traditional Dutch food. I really liked it. The red cabbage isn't that tradional, but still taste really good. I assume they adjusted the dish a bit so the international people like it.  I would def. recommend the restaurant."
55,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Perfect.  We totally stumbled on this place because it was close to our hotel. It was perfect luck. The food was unbelievably good, I had the house recommended beef (wonderful), but the star was the cabbage which came as one of the …"
56,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really tasty homemade food with great flavors. Warmed the insides on a cold day. Just a warning they charge extra for crispy potatoes vs boiled.. doesnt say anywhere in the menu. Grandmas homemade pudding was absolutely delicious. The meal sizes were more than adequate, we were stuffed."
57,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was pretty good. Service could be a lot better and more friendlier. As soon as I walked in it, it seemed like the gentleman behind the bar (maybe owner) was annoyed and didn't want to be bothered. Also, in my opinion, any place that doesn't want to serve tap water and forces customers to purchase bottle water"
58,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great traditional Dutch restaurant! Chicken in beer was incredible and the beer selection was all from the local brewery. Cheap house red too. Friendly and attentive service.
59,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best meals I had in Amsterdam. Felt like home cooking, which I love. The vegetables were all served family style in sharing dishes, which was really great for eating as a group, allows everybody to have a bit of everything. Very intimate and full of locals. Absolutely somewhere I will be returning to!"
60,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Really cozy, delicious homemade food and excellent service!"
61,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food:
Absolutely exquisite! We ordered their soup of the day as a starter to share; it was a clear mushroom broth that was literally sent from the gods - it was that …"
62,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very friendly staff. Some food isn't available if you are unlucky as they only make their food fresh so once their daily stockpile runs out that's all for the day. I can wholeheartedly recommend their fried potatoes :)
63,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Nice heart warming genuine dutch food for a reasonable price.
64,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Flavor 4.5 / Price 4.5 / Portion size 4 /
Staff 3 / Timely 4.5 My wife is very picky, yet she ate almost half my meal! The flavor was excellent, food was really home quality and fresh. It came out …"
65,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic food, friendly staff, you eat a lot and spend little.
If you are on holiday in Amsterdam and you are looking for a restaurant at a good price to eat typical cuisine I would highly recommend going here.
Watch out! If you're a group of 3 or more people you better arrive early."
66,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A hole in the wall restaurant with a small menu featuring traditional Dutch food popular with locals. If you’re not familiar, it’s easy to miss as you pass by it in this residential neighborhood. The inside is fairly small, so plan for a …"
67,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The kind of place that you will not just find unless you know it but you will be happy you did once you have been there!  It's a small and cozy restaurant so if you haven't reserved you might have to wait a bit.  There is however a bench …
68,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly & efficient staff,  very reasonable prices and really good simple Dutch menu. I was dining alone and was very lucky there was a table available when I arrived. After my dinner and dessert, I had to squish  past quite a crowd waiting in the vestibule for their turn to sit and eat."
69,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food and atmosphere, had a homely vibe to it."
70,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best restaurants I have ever been to. It is a beautiful quaint place that serves amazing meals. My boyfriend and I went in January and I will go again if I come back into the city. Would definitely recommend.
71,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious food, casual and unpretentious atmosphere, and VERY reasonable price. I had the house specialty beef stew: not picture worthy but taste worth. It came with generous portions of potato and bens, and together with a beer and a sparking water, came to €15.50."
72,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Compact and bijou I believe is the phrase 😀 great quirky restaurant with some very flavorful food. You may have to queue in the hallway of the house for bit but worth it. Oh did I not mention this ""restaurant"" is basically the ground floor of a converted house very cool."
73,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A very welcoming and near family atmosphere. Very popular but despite this excellent quick service, with delicious authentic, generous Dutch food. Does close rather early at 8pm and no credit card payment."
74,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Food was very traditional and delicious. Was just like being in Oma's kitchen! The staff were so friendly and helpful. We found out that the owners Opa started the restaurant in 1965 and it's still going strong today. It was very busy when …
75,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,5 years ago,It's a nice Dutch restaurant the food was so delicious and the staff is so friendly the nicest thing was that if you like you can sit with the people on the same table this was also ao nice
76,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great comfort food in a beautiful little restaurant. The portions are big, the food is hot and everything is delicious. …"
77,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,8 months ago,A classic Dutch restaurant. Simple but great food in an intimate setting. Highly recommended.
78,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you want to have a meal where the locals go for a meal, that’s your place. Very casual. Ask for a soup and the daily special. Arrive for lunch at 11 am if you don’t want to wait on the line. Instead you can go to a fancy restaurant and …"
79,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very very tasty. Tastes like a traditional home cooked meal. We got stewed beef, Dutch steak, curd w/ fruit, and chicken soup. We loved every item."
80,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food! Truly!
This place is where the locals go, so there's a certain feel in this restaurant. …"
81,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Delicious food. I got the beef stew and my husband got grandma's meatballs. The sauce was amazing and I loved the vegetables that came with it. Very nice staff. Great beer. And the chocolate soufle was great!
82,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,5 years ago,My wife and I were fortunate enough to have dinner here while visiting Amsterdam. Reminded us of home and the good food of our dutch family! We were incredibly well fed but unfortunately did not have room to try a dessert - would have loved to though! Very highly recommended!!!
83,Hap Hmm, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Simple, Dutch food, steamed vegetables and meats... quality fine but low on inspiration."
84,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a lovely evening meal here, open 5 days a week of a evening, serving local Dutch cuisine, warm and friendly atmosphere and used by locals. Only downside is that you cannot book a table. If you have to queue, stick in there... you won't be disappointed. Enjoy."
85,Hap Hmm, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Stumbled upon this restaurant by chance, and it turns out it's a very popular place to go. For a reason as well, the food is great, but the service is terrible, especially the young waitress who was very disrespectful. Beware the long …"
86,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food! Hard to find in between homes.
87,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best place to eat. Meet the locals and have the most amazing locals cusine..  Lush food can not fault,  go here when ever possible and we are never ever disappointed..  Unless they are closed.  All the locals eat here as its fantastic food and value without a doubt! I love this place best place in dam!"
88,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"i recommend tomato soup and stewed beef (grilled) it is served with some veggies and potato. they are all yummy. price is the best, everyone is extremely friendly. love it!"
89,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Quaint restaurant in a quiet neighborhood in Amsterdam, serving traditional Dutch food. Prices are reasonable, service is brisk, but friendly. There is often a wait, as the restaurant is literally in a converted loving and dining room if a house, with a small front hall entry."
90,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious restaurant for the locals. It can seat 2 to 6 depending on how busy. But beware! Have cash! Don't be like me who didn't have the right type of credit card :(
91,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What an AMAZING place that was! I live next to it and I have never been there since very recently.  The food is amazing and the prices are super low compared to rest of Amsterdam. Food is local with massive portions and it …
92,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Almost a secret place that only locals know about. open early and closes earlier than most other restaurants. Sort of Dutch food like your mama cooked, that's what our Dutch host said. Mama's cooking or not, was absolutely delicious. Nothing fancy nor a place with ambience or sex appeal, just really good food."
93,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was decent, and a good cozy atmosphere but apparently the place is small and we had to wait for 20 minutes. If you are a vegetarian, this is not the place because there was only one dish which was portobello mushroom, which was also good. I ate chocolate soufflé which was decent enough too!"
94,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely place to eat something typical from Holland.
95,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This was a little gem of a restaurant that my husband I found on our trip to Amsterdam. Quality of the food is outstanding and it’s cleary a favourite with the locals and for good reason. No reservations so be prepared to wait about 10-20 …
96,Hap Hmm, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Went based off of reviews online and was not disappointed. We had the meatballs and stew. I would recommend the meatballs over the stew and should have went with the Amsterdam chicken cause it sounds so good.
97,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was good, but portions were a bit small. The service was good. They're cash (or bank card, no credit) only and they don't serve tap water, so value is a bit questionable. Service was good."
98,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good fresh home made food. Local hang out and good service. Be aware that this is a popular place with the neighbors, so there might be some wait. But it is worth it. Good portion sizes too."
99,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I always recommend this place to my friends visiting The Netherlands. Locals love this place and the food is very traditional and simple. very affordable, friendly staff and great interior. reservation is not possible."
100,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Authentic Dutch food served by an authentic Amsterdam staff (including their witty jokes). Food is tasteful and wholesome but not the freshest. Have the Dutch curd with fruit for dessert!
101,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely. Warm with great service and tasty home cooking. Good for someone who wants a tasty stew with potatoes and veg, a reasonably price glass of wine and some cosiness."
102,Hap Hmm, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is packed if you go late. As for the food, its a bit salty in my opinion and the portion is small. The meatball  (notice i only used singular cause they only give you one) is salty. Overall, i think its a bit pricey but not too bad."
103,Hap Hmm, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The pork chop is a bit too raw which you can see the pink colour and slightly blood.The stew beef is a bit salty and the texture is not as soft as you imagine. But the owner and the interior was nice.
104,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing Dutch food, from starters to desert. We had the soup of the day, two traditional dishes (stewed beef and Viennese schnitzel) and the homemade pudin. Loved every minute of it."
105,Hap Hmm, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A bit of a curate's egg!  My beef was lovely, but don't offer vegetarian if you're just going to serve bought-in, low quality frozen rubbish."
106,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great Dutch food; home cooked and delicious; friendly staff. Try the bier chicken and mustard soup. Need cash as they don’t accept cards.
107,Hap Hmm, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"I usually take my out of town guests to The Pantry near Leidseplein for typical Dutch food, but thought I would give this restaurant a try since I saw it on the I amsterdam website. Takeaway message - go to The Pantry instead if you want to …"
108,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,5 years ago,What a great place. Its so busy but service is super quick. We had beef stew and meatballs and couldnt fault it - it was delicious. Finishing with pannacota with cream and a crepe suzette it rounded off a great meal.
109,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I saw the reviews on google and thought we would try it out. Really good food and very nice people running the place. Prices were okay but note that this is cash only.
110,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food and good service! Found on a cute side street, this restaurant feels like you're walking into a dutch home. If the nearby Foodhallen doesn't work out, I'd recommend swinging by here instead."
111,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Comfort food in a cozy atmosphere. I enjoyed my stewed beef, my husband enjoyed the schnitzel. Reasonable prices too."
112,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place to experience genuine Dutch food. The place is small so you may eat with strangers at a table or have to wait in line. It was worth it for the good meal!
113,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good Dutch food. Excellent service. Like the setting and atmosphere. Nice wall decor. Price is good too.
114,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hap means Eat, Hmm means poeple like it. Well, very popular restaurant with a well prepared dutch cuisine. We got a queue when arrive around sixers. Waig to be tabled for 30 min. then its all worth the wait."
115,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very delicious food and super friendly staff! Great place. You should make reservations or prepare for a long wait.
116,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a lovely home style authentic Dutch meal in this cosy little restaurant. Only unpleasant surprise was being charged for a small glass of tap water :(
Shame."
117,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Very nice and traditional Dutch food .. Staff very kind and excellent quality/price ratio! Don't miss the stuffed meat (speciality of the place) and the 180gr stake meat .. To pay attention only to opening hours, since it closes very early (8pm)"
118,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Dined here with 2 kids under 6 and the staff were excellent in making it very easy. Food was great, basic, traditional but most of all, absolutely delicious."
119,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow, wow and wow, we wanted to experience traditional food and found Holland's Hap on the old interweb bit of a trek from where we were staying but boy was it worth it, we had the beef stew which was in a word perfection, the gravy, the …"
120,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cosy and delicious food that was relatively affordable. The beef stew was a little salty but still delicious. And of course, pair it with fries and some decadent dutch mayonnaise."
121,Hap Hmm, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Traditional Dutch style restaurant: meat, potatoes and your choice of vegetables. Super fast, cheap and friendly service. Award winning wiener schnitzel. Simple but maybe the last in a dying breed of restaurants."
122,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A very nice cozy little restaurant. The staff is friendly and the food was good. If you want something genuinely Dutch!
123,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful food & great service. Usually busy so best to book. We visit every time we are in Amsterdam. Home cooked food & local beers.

126,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent beef stew and Vienna schnitzel with boiled potatoes peas and carrots. A good meal at a fair price
127,Hap Hmm, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very little space, not comfortable. Food very simple, not tasty. NEVER BUY SALAD HERE!!! You’ll be disappointed for sure. And they dont accept credit cards."
128,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best food we had all holiday and at such a competitive price. Very warm and friendly staff I would go again in a heartbeat.
129,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really good place. Probably always is full but it is worthy to wait. Dinner was like being at mum's house. Not expensive at all.
130,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A very simple, delicious and hearty meal at an affordable price in a small corridor, almost. Fast service. Great for having a quick (solo) dinner."

132,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food was amazing and authentic with a home-cooked feel. Definitely worth the wait and the price.
133,Hap Hmm, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Offered traditional Dutch food which we wanted to try! Portions were enough and filling, however a bit on the pricier side."
134,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fabulous family run restaurant, very friendly and varied menu. The local beer (Natte) is highly recommended."
135,Hap Hmm, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Ref demanding Sandheep below,  who finds this no good place for veggy food... Next to his portobello mushrooms he could have chosen another seven or so fresh vegs (also those your granny lovingly made...) and he should definitely  have …"
