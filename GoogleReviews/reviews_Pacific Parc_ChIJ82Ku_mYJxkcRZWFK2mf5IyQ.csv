0,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Nice restaurant with an outdoor seating area in Westerpark. Very cool and comfortable ambiance. ‚Ä¶
1,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice place but poor service when we went there. By the way, it is the bottle another client on the picture. The table was not clean before we were seated."
2,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"I had brunch here. The service was very friendly and the terrace was spacious, sunny and nice. I got the breakfast combo, it was really not that special."
3,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Beautiful decoration. A place from Brunch to late drinks
4,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,a month ago,Food is good and cheap - but had a very bad experience with a waitress that came to us and was really agressive - shouting at us to know if we had a Covid pass and a booking (we had just entered the place) and was really unprofessional - we went for a dinner somewhere else this time
5,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,7 months ago,We had a South Africans get together with a big group of people at Pacific . We only had drinks so can‚Äôt comment on the food but the venue and the friendly staff were really great in managing and making sure it all ran smoothly! Great terrace and inside area as well! Thanks for doing a great job!
6,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"From the time we entered, the manager was being rude and even rolling her eyes when talking. The rest of the staff was friendly and nice. Drinks took too long to come. DJ that was advertised was not there. Good location and space."
7,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cozy place. Here you can find a perfect spot for having a beer, listening to live music and dancing until late. The tables outside and the fireplace inside make it a good fit for a winter as well as a summer night. Prices are not high ‚Ä¶"
8,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great place to hang out both day and night
9,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"tiny glass of wine at an exorbitant price, drink so alcoholic, almost undrinkable, the Ginger Beer was however good"
10,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Terrible service.
The waiter was extremely condescending and rude fro absolutely no reason. ‚Ä¶"
11,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very quiet at 2pm in a sunny Monday. Service was slow but the lunch food was nice. I had their ""famous"" patatje papa which turned out to be a dish of beef rendang with chips. Tasty, though."
12,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice place to have some drinks with friends, the terrace is big eunogh to always find a place to sit. The service is friendly and fast and the selection of food is good. The grilled octopus and the empanadas could definitely be better. But the gyoza is on point."
13,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,a year ago,Waited 25 minutes for a coffee and Cola. Coffee was cold and some took a bite from the cookie üôÑ. Luckily we got a new coffee.
14,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Lovely place! Beautiful space and design! Great food and decent amount of drinks. Professional and polite staff‚Ä¶ definitely going back there again!
15,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,a month ago,Very good food and great cocktails.
16,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to have a drink with friends, I had a good homemade lemonade even though too sweet. Great music !"
17,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Really nice restaurant with nice food good location within westerpark, friendly staff. Quality products used for the food and rapid service, overall really nice place to have lunch, dinner a snack or just drinks. I recommend for the food ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
18,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great new menu and chef... friendly helpful staff. One of the nicest terasses of Amsterdam. üôèüèª
19,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Good service and a nice atmosphere. Food is OK, but nothing special with a limited choice of options."
20,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Good food, friendly staff, great ambience! Awesome for a night with friends!"
21,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,a year ago,Drinks with colleagues either inside or outside. And enough space to sit at save distance from eachother (Covid).
22,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Good atmosphere, decent food although burger was a little underseasoned, nice drinks. Very slow service, we waited 30 mins for each drink."
23,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,So impressed with the renovation! The food is so good & it's super vibey. Eat drink & dance. YES <3
24,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Food and service were okay, but considering the current corona measures, the tables inside were way too close to each other and nobody cared to do any checks."
25,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Nothing special.
Cocktails were mediocre, food was not tasty even the french fries were bad."
26,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,a year ago,A great spot to relax and have a cocktail while enjoying the sunset. On warm summerdays there are a lot of beach chairs that you can arrange freely to match your needs. Enjoy the street art performers in front of the location and try the vegetarian Bitterballen!
27,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Even though there was a maximum of 30 people allowed I felt like they couldn't manage it. ""Medium-rare"" steak was well done and had frozen butter on it... some rounds of drinks took over half an hour to arrive..."
28,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Spacious yet cost atmosphere. Food came quickly and was super fresh,  the menu was seasonal yet diverse. The food surprised me with bursts of flavour that the menu can't describe alone. We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. The staff are super helpful, attentive and friendly which makes it even more worthwhile."
29,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice and cozy place to have a good dinner. The atmosphere of the restaurant is the main thing which i liked the most. ‚Ä¶
30,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Had dinner here with my son and my BFF yesterday. What an amazing service!!! Litteraly all the staff was super friendly, checked up on us multiple times despite of how busy it was. Not to mention the menu and food is also super nice and diverse. Loved Loved Loved it."
31,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"super nice!!! I always used to go there for drinks and parties, and today I had food there for the first time and I am super amazed :)))"
32,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Super service, really nice snacks! The sweet potato fries are excellent"
33,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A cool bar/cafe in the hearth of Westerpark. In the night the space turns into a bar with loud music where you can actually get out from the table or bar and dance! Is a great location to have a drink outside when the sun is about to go ‚Ä¶
34,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Shame, it was awsome. Already busy with a good menu and open for lunch. Now it's only open from 3 and a very odd menu. ‚Ä¶"
35,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I have been to Pacific couple of times now, for dinner and drinks.
Top service. Delicious food - try the octopus starter and Aubergine main dish, it is delicious. Also the pacific burger is very tasty!"
36,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Extraordinary food, fabulous service, and reasonable prices. My husband and I had dinner at Pacific on May 14th. He had the cod and I had the vegetarian eggplant dish; both were excellent, as was our lemon tart dessert. A great restaurant!"
37,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice place to chill.. nothing formal, just chill"
38,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice open place, pets are welcome, good service.
Stop what you're doing and go here."
39,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"One of my favorite places to have a drink. Both inside as outside it's wonderful to lounge and have a drink. The place has plenty of space to dance also, usually with the music of a live band or dj. ‚Ä¶"
40,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Nothing like the place it used to be. Tottaly vibeless, generic"
41,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Slow attention. like 15 minutes to take my order. The beer was ok.
42,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,a year ago,"Really bad service... took 45min for a side of fries which were cold and maybe 10 in the bowl. No sauce (they were chipotle mayo fries) and when we asked twice, we still didnt get any. Literally had to chase people for a drink!"
43,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice new place! Had a very nice dinner and a great night out last weekend. They open till 04.00 in the weekend. Next time I will try their terrace looks great top. Good luck!
44,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,4 months ago,nachos so good i felt pregnant
45,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"I absolutely love the place. Pretty good service (please note that it is not common to have bread and water in  restaurant in Amsterdam without asking for it and consequently being charged). The food was really tasty, and not that pricy at ‚Ä¶"
46,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, busy in the evening, but not toxically crowded. Nice beer too. Good place when it's summer (big terrace) and winter (nice seats inside)."
47,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Great large terrace for sunny afternoons. Venue looks nice since the rebuilt. Food and drinks are slightly overpriced and nothing. We took the 'braadstuk' with salsa verde which could have been enough for 1 person only.
48,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great atmosphere, food, and staff!"
49,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Very nice terrace.  offers a good variety of food and beverages
50,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The dancing after 12 is fun. Diverse crowd and live music at times. As a restaurant Pacific just sucks. Food was blant, simple and pricey compared to the quality. Waiters where slow and forgetful, even by Amsterdam standards."
51,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Used to be one of my favourite places in Amsterdam. Now just another bar. Service could be better, but the food is okay, the prices decent and the atmosphere excellent. Nice location in Westerpark. ‚Ä¶"
52,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,3 years ago,"‚ÄúOnly at night this place is good.‚Äù

As a cafe it is quite poor but as a nightclub is a very fun place to meet interesting people. I have great experiences. Good music, live sometimes."
53,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,a month ago,One of my favorites in Amsterdam.
54,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice  ambiance.  Just took a while to get the attention of a staff member.  Dogs aloud in and different settings to sit. Also good bitterballen.
55,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,3 years ago,So good...So nice...so romantic for weekdays
56,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This is a bad story that happened Saturday night, August 31st,  to me and spoiled the party . I asked politely one of the guys behind the bar if he knew where  I had to pick up Uber since my phone was indicating a meeting point to me not ‚Ä¶"
57,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Really nice
58,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Lovely place to have a beer and to have a dance during the nights. They mostly play rock music. During the days you can have a meal or a drink and sit outside on the big terrace. Staff is friendly and the prices are okay.
59,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very nice food and great staff!
60,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,a year ago,"So nice and quiet place under the sun.
Delicious ""yellow"" fruit shake to taste for child. And large choice of beers for daddy."
61,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best location for a bar in the city, in Westerpark!

A bit hipster but what are you going to do, it's a new venue in Amsterdam. Get ‚Ä¶"
62,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Saturday night - went early, so wasn't super crowded.  Great dive bar with a live stage.  Live music wasn't my cup of tea, but at least the beers were good."
63,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,2 years ago,"What did you do to the place?? What an incredible shame! This place used to be vibrant and truly had a soul. No need to go here anymore, this is like every other semi-trendy bar; overpriced and no rock 'n roll. #bringbackpacific."
64,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,a year ago,Lounging in this cool cafe is fantastic! Staff is quick and very very friendly  and bring ur order in no time with a joke&smile!!
65,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Amazing staff, food and drink,  we come back frequently!"
66,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Cosy place to have lunch in winter or sit outside for a beer in summer. The service is typically dutch so you might wait a while. On weekends and special occasions there are parties that 35+ year old folks seem to enjoy, but these should be ‚Ä¶"
67,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"At daytime a nice and informal cafe populated by hipsters and families. The menu was not to long, and when the were out of fish soup the only real alternative was tapas. We ordered squids, and got a plate with tomatoes, onions and parsley - and two small bits og squids. But the waiter got the plate filled up when we commented this."
68,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,2 years ago,"So now is a normal place in Amsterdam as other million places more. They kill the underground true atmosphere just to make a copy and paste from other places. Really sad to see a such a legendary place converted in just another Place... Really sad.
RIP pacific."
69,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere, raisonnable prices and good music. You shall have a drink here!"
70,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service, great choice of drinks and then in the evening great music - what more can you ask for! Love the vibe of this place."
71,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Perfect blend of relaxation, food and drink"
72,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,2 years ago,You did a whole renovation and did not do soundproofing. Do you realise residents live across from you? Total lack of respect playing terrible music until 4am. We will all be going to the Gemente to fight for your license to be revoked
73,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Rock n toll music, great atmosphere and fantastic location in the heart of Westerpark."
74,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Loved that kids were allowed to jump around the restaurant
75,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,3 years ago,"After ordering a beer we waited 15 minutes to place an order.
Then decided to ask for the bill to wait another 10 minutes for it...
At least staff looked like having fun inside with eachother"
76,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We had a delicious fish there for lunch. On the other hand, home made wine was not as good as we expected. Staff was nice and kind."
77,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The atmosphere has completely changed which is such a shame. The old pacific was down to earth, cultural, fun and open to everyone. People would be dancing all night long several nights per week and it was one of Amsterdam's gems with lots ‚Ä¶"
78,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,6 years ago,"I used to love coming to Pacific Park with friends for dinner, drinks, and music. Today, it was raining and I walked into Pacific park and sat inside with my laptop. I was politely asked what I wanted to drink and I politely said nothing, ‚Ä¶"
79,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Been there for the New Year's party and the place is really nice, big enough, two bars so you didn't have to wait for the drinks"
80,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty cool, I like this place better after they renovated. The bar is nicer, music is better."
81,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The only thing this place has going for it is the sunny patio in summer. Arrogant staff, bad food and high prices otherwise."
82,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice food, different flavor combinations. Service is a bit slow and it's towards the expensive category"
83,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Worst Service in Amsterdam ( and that's saying something). My colleagues and I come here regularly because it's close to our work. Staff is perpetually unfriendly, arrogant and very slow (I can't believe they have jobs at all). Price is on ‚Ä¶"
84,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Pacific Parc is dead. In return we got an overpriced restaurant that seems to have copy-pasted their whole interior from some interior design catalogue. Extremely unoriginal, such a pity. Bring back the old Pacific!"
85,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"No concept whatsoever of sound balance at night. Cool for drinks during the day, but so is any other place in the city."
86,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,3 years ago,"If you're reading this: you're too late. This used to be an iconic Amsterdam live music venue, until it was bought out by soulless, money hungry developers who immediately moved to remove its soul."
87,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Good for friday&saturday party and some special events. I wouldn't recommend for lunch or dinner. Last time I was there I see some mice chilling around.
88,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"Great place, nice food. Just a shame about the absolute worst staff ever. Rude, incooperate and slow. It's unbelievable that some of these people still have a job here."
89,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place was great craic. Great for sitting in the sun having a drink. Food and staff were lovely.
90,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great place to have a beer and go dancing. Service during the day is not so good though.
Anyway the place is awesome!"
91,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Great in the winter, unwind near the fireplace. Great in summer too, having a drink on the terrace outside. Often have livemusic in weekend days."
92,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the few places around that still has live bands rocking every weekend. Good fun during the day on the outside terrace turns into madness when the night comes
93,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"No more rock & roll. The rough edges are lost. A fine cafe, but nothing new. The Old spirit seems gone."
94,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Really pretty space with nice lighting, good music and cosy fireplace. Staff attitude is surprising bad though. Hence the three star rating. Really bad.  üëé"
95,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A nice big location, a big terrace. The food is good and a good selection of beers."
96,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing nachos (the best in Amsterdam so far) Nice ambiance. Nice cocktails, top!"
97,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Came for a drink, it was ok but not that much enjoyable .. sometimes you can be forgotten :/"
98,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amsterdam at its best: good bar, nice food, a nice terrace in the sun, a very laid back atmosphere. Families during the day and rowdy club until the early morning."
99,Pacific Parc, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This used to be an amazing place, a place with a soul. Now is just another Amsterdam's trendy h√≠pster place for millenials. What have you done to this place?! So sad..."
100,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,9 years ago,Awesome place chill or hang out. Cultural park in amsterdam near central station. Big terras in summer. Lots of people. Live dj most nights. Recommended!
101,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Nice area and cool environment for any season of the year, from Winter to Summer!"
102,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Food took 45-60 mins to get, wasn't very good. I had vegetable curry. Good service and atmosphere."
103,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,a year ago,Seems like the only great brunch place in this area of the park!
104,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Pacific parc is a weird place.... It's great, but odd, expensive coat check, drinks are done with tokens and cash back, strange decor, highly variable music, an experience for sure!"
105,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is very average, especially for these prices. Atmosphere on tarace outside is nice."
106,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,7 years ago,Cool place with great music. However staff are more into themselves than into serving customers.
107,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Used to be an edgy, alternative spot. Since it was bought by ID&T it changed, and it's now a generic club/hangout for millennials."
108,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very nice to visit also during a day :)

Quite a choice of foods and drinks. ‚Ä¶"
109,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"One of my most favorite places in Amsterdam! Perfect for a coffee in the sun, a sit by the fire in winter, and the perfect party at night!"

112,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved the octopus starter.Beef burger and beyond beef burger was also amazing.Try it once
113,Pacific Parc, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Unfortunately the renovation took away the special character of Pacific Park, nothing special any more, just one more bar."
114,Pacific Parc, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It's looks amazing. A delight just to be there. Can't wait to go more often.
115,Pacific Parc, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Good music, very nice atmosphere, not the best service or food."
116,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good food, try their lamb chops, can't whine too much about the service when the food tastes amazing :)"
117,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Cozy fireplace, OK selection of beers and hot drinks. On the con side, I saw a huge rat outside which put me off a bit."

119,Pacific Parc, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really cool place to go have a drink or dance later in the night!
