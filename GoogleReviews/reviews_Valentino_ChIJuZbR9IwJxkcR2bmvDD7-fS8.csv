0,Valentino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I guess I’ve eaten about 500 Turkish pizza’s in my life. About 10 of them at this place. And they never fail to disappoint me with their worst quality and service in all of NL. If being the best at being the worst is an actual strategy, they absolutely nailed it."
1,Valentino, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great for late night snacking/meals. Had a pretty good falafel sandwich and good portion of fries for about €6. Veggie options are limited but if you eat meat, there are plenty of items to choose from."
2,Valentino, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Had nice doner durum. The mixing could have been better but still enjoyed the doner. The area inside the cafe is way too less especially with the closely 0acked tables and chairs. May be setting a side table with high chairs facing the window can make one feel more spacious inside.
3,Valentino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The food at this place was inedible. The ""chicken"" doners tasted like the equivalent of dog food. Disgusting place and they overcharged us by double the amount."
4,Valentino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fries with ketchup were great. The ketchup was apple-like flavoured! The cook was kind.
5,Valentino, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Kebab was okay. Not the best or worst. But the guy was not very nice to his customers
