0,CafâˆšÂ© Verhoeff, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Unfriendly Dutch owner. They prefer their own people. Live here now 12 years, this was my worst visit in a cafe. They have a big sign for PIN, but do not mention, that you need to order more than 10â‚¬. Bitterballen took 35 minutes. Tourists should not go there, since they answer back in Dutch. Check nicer places."
1,CafâˆšÂ© Verhoeff, 5 stars ,10 years ago,Fantastic local pub. The bartender and other patrons were more than welcoming . We were fed ossesworst and even had a gentleman play us some American tunes that he knew on the piano. Protip: let the bartender recommend your drinks.
