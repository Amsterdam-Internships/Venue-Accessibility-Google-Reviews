0,Tokoman, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Just not My favorourite. Hapsjeshoek accross the road is just better quality for less money. A no brainer for me
1,Tokoman, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"They've been here 20 years (or even longer but I've been coming here for 18 years out of convenience). Quality is consistent, taste is original and prices are reasonable. The service is not great, especially the guy when you're not Dutch ‚Ä¶"
2,Tokoman, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I do like this Surinamese take-out. It's clean, uses fresh ingredients, dishes and pastries are not too greasy, they offer a lot of choice (even a nice vegetarian roti roll) and still, most dishes are really tasty!"
3,Tokoman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I‚Äôve had visiting family and friends visit me for the past 3 months. Every time a new person comes, I take them to Tokoman. I personally think they have very authentic foods. It‚Äôs not like wok to walk or Panda Express. A lot of the dishes ‚Ä¶"
4,Tokoman, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I loved the Surinamese Chicken. They had a large variety and different combinations to choose from all from Suriname. Not ideal to eat in, but great if you want takeaway."
5,Tokoman, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A nice surprise, i didn't expect much from such a place at first and i was wrong. I tried the beef pastry (a hot brioche-like bread filled with beef and vegetable) and a chiken curry sandwich and both were delicious (and not very expensive). A good choice if you are in a hurry."
6,Tokoman, 1 star ,3 years ago,I don't know if the food is good (looked dirty)... we didn't even taste it because of the delusional and disrespectful owner !!! Doesn't have a shred of respect. ‚Ä¶
