0,Joost, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice little neighborhood bar with a good beer selection. Couple of good whiskies to be had.
Good service and nice customers."
1,Joost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Such a great place with the friendliest bartender. I’m so happy we dropped by this place. Great beers (only local breweries, thumbs up) and awesome combinations of gin tonics. Indie, folk and rock and a friendly atmosphere, combined with the drinks makes this an easy full rating!"
2,Joost, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,nice place with always a friendly bar tender that chats with you.. terrace is heated. fresh dutch newspapers
3,Joost, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Always good vibes when you enter, lovely personnel & good beer."
4,Joost, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Joost should have 6 stars, it is that good. Local beers, often brewed with a few miles of the bar. Great selection, that changes a lot and most certainly with the seasons. Knowledgeable, friendly and humorous crew. Great places to sit outside and enjoy busy Amsterdam oost. It's a small place, so it gets crowded easy."
5,Joost, 5 stars ,a month ago,Cosy bar on a corner in Amsterdam Oost. Worth the visit..
6,Joost, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Small place that gets crowded easily. Focused on specialised beers, most of them quite strong in taste. Serves a great gin-tonic, with a very decent price. But get some food nearby before you start drinking, they don't serve food and what they serve is all quite strong."
7,Joost, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Small local pub in a great area of Amsterdam. The owner/barman was very friendly and welcoming, letting us sample a few of the beers before buying which I always like. Good music and great beer at good price. Can't wait to go back next time we're in the Dam."
8,Joost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good, lively environment. Value for money on drinks. Tables outside for those who want to experience the Amsterdam weather. There are a couple of good places all around, allowing you to rest after some shopping."
9,Joost, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,A nice cozy Amsterdam bar.
10,Joost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Warm place, nice local biers, very kind bartenders, good music and board games"
11,Joost, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Favorite neighborhood bar, decent music. Crowded on weekends, but perfect week day after work local spot. Lot's of local craft beers! They do G&Ts but have little selection for cocktails, but it isn't a cocktail place."
