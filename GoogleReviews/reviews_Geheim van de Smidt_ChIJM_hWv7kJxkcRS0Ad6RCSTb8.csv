0,Geheim van de Smidt, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"It is common in red light district that the bars or any stores are all quite small in space. This coffee bar is little fun place to go,gentle music, handsome and really nice bartender . The only thing is that it was too hot inside since the heater was  turned  a little high."
1,Geheim van de Smidt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,THEY HAVE GLÜWEIN (£4) !! Adorable little place. The type of bar you want to be at every night chilling.
2,Geheim van de Smidt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cosy, relaxed bar / cafe. Didn't eat here, but the drink, ambience and staff were all very good. A nice escape from the bustle outside."
3,Geheim van de Smidt, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Close to the RLD, but far enough away from the English lads and American college kids that the experience isn't cringey. Well made drinks and has an outdoor tables section that's right on the canal."
4,Geheim van de Smidt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went there tonight for the first time with a friend. Really relaxed place to chill, talk and have a drink. You can (also) sit outside and have a view of the canals or the street. The bartender is a really chill girl with a great sense of humor. :D"
5,Geheim van de Smidt, 4 stars ,10 months ago,Cute little coffee shop. Took a while to bring us our order (2 mulled wines) but only cost 4 Euros and it was delicious. Charming place with a nice atmosphere.
6,Geheim van de Smidt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Sweet bar, good prices and friendly service ♡"
7,Geheim van de Smidt, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice beers and great service by two cheerful Lebanese ladies.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are the ones who suggested the dreadful greasy Lebanese ""restaurant"" next door."
