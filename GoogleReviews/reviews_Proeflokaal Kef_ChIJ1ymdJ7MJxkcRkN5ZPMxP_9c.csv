0,Proeflokaal Kef, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We did a wine and cheese tasting here, and it was 100% worth it. Friendly and knowledgeable staff taught us all about the various cheeses we sampled (about ten cheese total). It was a great and relaxing experience and lasted about two hours. Would highly recommend."
1,Proeflokaal Kef, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We splurged for a cheese tasting paired with beer (there's also the wine option), and it was so much worth it. These people really like their cheeses and talking about it. They also have an annex store, with dozens (likely a hundred) types of cheeses to take home."
