2,Little Thai Prince, 3 stars ,a month ago,"Compressed restaurant with little space for the customers. The waitress was a bit distracted and forgot what we ordered. However, after second food order, our dishes was prepared really fast. Food was delicious and spicy. Good portions. Beer could be cheaper."
3,Little Thai Prince, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Small restaurant but friendly staff.Prices of main dishes start at 15€.Appetizers were a bit greasy(fishcakes)but main dish""pat krapao gai"" was spicy like it should be and enough chicken added.Price/quality ok"

5,Little Thai Prince, 1 star ,2 months ago,I genuinely feel this restaurant is not suitable for people that have food allergies or intolerances. I say this because I found an unidentified foreign object in my vegan dish that resembled a shell of something or a bone. Apart from that …

12,Little Thai Prince, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A great little thai oasis on the edge of busy Chinatown. This might be the best to food we've eaten in Europe. I would highly recommend it. Sit right in the back and you can see the food being prepared in a relatively small, open kitchen. All the staff are Thai and most of the food is made in the Thai, rather than western style."
13,Little Thai Prince, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food here was so tasty! We totally enjoyed every dish, be it king prawns, chicken or the beef dishes, all was yum. Also great value for money and the service was friendly also. Definitely recommend"

32,Little Thai Prince, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food, friendly staf!"
33,Little Thai Prince, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Food was alright. A bit overhyped we thought. Everything we ordered had a curry powder under taste to it. I don't know if it's just the things we ordered or if it's adapted to suit the Dutch who love their 'curry powder'. All in all not a big thumbs up from us.
34,Little Thai Prince, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best Thia food I have had the pleasure of tasting
35,Little Thai Prince, 3 stars ,6 years ago,I would give this place 5 stars for the food. Very tasty.  Gets 3 stars because they would not serve us tap water unless we ordered drinks!  So I ordered a tiny bottle of water (2 euros) and asked again for tap water.  I was informed that …

The food was very good and tasty, the service was very friendly and efficient. The prices are good for what you get."
48,Little Thai Prince, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Starter was great! Mains were pretty big portions looking at what friends ordered.

55,Little Thai Prince, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The Thai food here is close to been authentic. Their even have their Thai beer. The spiciness isn't close to what Thailand has to offer. Probably has to tune it down to suite the people's taste.
56,Little Thai Prince, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I simply asked for tap water, the grumpy rude waitress (who's there quite often) refused saying it was a ""new policy""  and that I should go to mc Donald's if I wanted free water... I rarely respond to these kind of comments, I just walked off and will never go back there anymore.."

59,Little Thai Prince, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Tom Yum is ok, but far from being authentic."
60,Little Thai Prince, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Small venue, but the food is fantastic. Reservations are probably a good idea since there aren't a lot of tables and the place seems pretty popular."
