0,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"It's a popular place so better go early. üòä Liked their toasties, their tea and chocolate! I don't drink coffee anymore, but my friend who tried said it's tasty! Nice atmosphere and friendly staff! ‚Ä¶"
1,Koffie Academie, 1 star ,a month ago,The coffee wasn't hot an they should be ashamed for the grilled cheese sandwich they served. Will never visit the Koffie Academie again and would advise everyone to stay away. And the young lady behind the counter should learn some basic greetings for potential new customers who don't use Google maps.
2,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Rarely, very rarely, I give out a five stars, but this time I really must.

Welcome to Koffie Academie, this quirky hipster cafe where brewed with mastery ‚Ä¶"

4,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Can't fault anything. Great presentation and tasty coffee. Also a good selection of cakes, toasties and fresh juices.
I came back here after some time and found a new welcoming staff which makes the place very friendly. Highly recommended! Gezellig!"
5,Koffie Academie, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Very tasty coffee and nice atmosphere. But chicken sandwich was too dry.
6,Koffie Academie, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Friendly young owners, making you feel at home. They recently opened so they probably still need some experience and time to refine the offer, that during my visit was a bit limited. Great coffee!"
7,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,4 months ago,So nice I stopped in twice.  Great vibe.  Great tea.  Great pastries.
8,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,4 months ago,My favourite coffee in Amsterdam - always with a choice of 2 or 3 different beans. Do proper flat whites and cortados and the guys in there are lovely too. Proper coffee.
9,Koffie Academie, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"lovely atmosphere. Very cozy. Very nice and kind young girls who work here, may not be professional waitresses or bartenders, I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs a bit of this place‚Äôs charm. The ‚Äúsnack‚Äù of toasted chicken sandwich, is good to try; however, the ‚Ä¶"
10,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Don't know if it was because I was hungry but the coffee here gave me goosebumps. The toastie I got (mushrooms) was also a bliss to eat. Would recommend!
11,Koffie Academie, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Great place for coffee but a little bit expensive. The service is top notch, the vibe is excellent especially if you are here to work on your laptop."
12,Koffie Academie, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice cosy place, good barista, quick, attending and good service, had cappuccino so need to go back to try an espresso. Nice music and good vibe in the store. Also for to go."
13,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great ambience, and amazing coffee and fresh pastry! üòä also a fantastic work station for a few hours:)"
14,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely a great choice especially if you're a coffee addict. Because they definitely know what they're doing and you can get the real taste of coffee with alternative brewing techniques. Plus Vegan friendly*
15,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely chilled atmosphere, friendly service, and great coffee. Filter available (v60, aeropress) as well as the usual espresso fare. It's a great espresso tho!"

17,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I really think this might have been the best flat white I have ever had. Its so great! And the price is really low as well for such a great cup of coffee. I came here in May 2017 on my first trip to Amsterdam and had to make sure to come back during my second trip!
18,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is honestly fabulous. Me and a friend were in Amsterdam for three days, found this place on the first day and went back every single day. Everyone is so friendly and after the first day our order was remembered and referred to as ‚Ä¶"

20,Koffie Academie, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Cannot talk about coffee quality, but the food was, for a 8,80Euro sandwich, really letting me down. A Chicken Sandwich with Avocado and Cheese for that price just raises expectations to a fresh and nice sandwich. See yourself, what I got."

22,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great service and good old fashioned coffee.  The banana bread is amazing!

31,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best coffee joints in Amsterdam. Love the rusty looking interior design, the laid-back vibe and the friendliness of the staff. Overall a brilliant little place to cozy up with a person you care about, or do some remote working."

38,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty good vibe in here. The cakes are dry. I suspect that is the style of bananna bread in Amsterdam. Tasty nonetheless.
39,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really cozy and welcoming interior with wooden tables and pictures on the walls. Staff is exceptional! They also have wifi here and people come in to work on their laptops. You‚Äôll surely find something for breakfast or light lunch that you‚Äôll love. Batch brew was lovely!

50,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A lovely coffee place. A chilled out, relaxed atmosphere which is a blessing for me and my morning coffee. Prices were not too expensive in my opinion. Coffee was very tasty and cold drinks satisfyingly refreshing."
51,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"During our short stay in Amsterdam, we had our daily morning coffee here. Super cozy. Friendly staff. All types of milk available. Yummy coffee. If you try one thing: monkey magic granola with coconut yogurt!"

55,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely love this place! Their coffee is extraordinarily good (one can also choose between different beans) and for me, the quality is definitively worth the slightly above average prices"
56,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Koffie Academie should be on the bucket list of every serious coffee aficionado . Here you can enjoy an espresso or beautifully  adorned cappuccino in a charming chilled out  area overlooking the busy going-ons of the Overtoom at the front ‚Ä¶

61,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice, cosy place to have a coffee or lunch or both haha"
62,Koffie Academie, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good coffee and cakes to go along with. If in need for exactly that it more than gets the job done, with friendly staff yo boot. Seems like a place locals hang out at with their laptops."
63,Koffie Academie, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The coffee is good, pricier than most places, but you get free water and free WiFi, so it is fair enough. Good ambience. Not enough power outlets. Banana cake tastes disgusting (for a non-vegan person). It is too sweet, sticky, and has too ‚Ä¶"
64,Koffie Academie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My barista days have long passed, but I still refuse to settle for less than brewed with know how and love for the coffee. This is my to go to place when I want an Americano. I am sure they make awesome espresso, because you can't make the one without the other, but I just love their tall cup of joe."

74,Koffie Academie, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Cute place in a busy street. Very good music to realize you are not at your living room but in a caf√©. Minus points for not putting a plate below the coffee cup. Where are you supposed to leave the spoon?
