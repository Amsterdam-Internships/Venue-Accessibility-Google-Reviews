0,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice atmosphere. Very Good service. Long list of options: drinks. For those who look for food, turn around."
1,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 2 stars ,8 months ago,The food was correct. We were 7people. However we shared a plate for 2 people and they made us pay one for 3 people. Moreover they let us make all the calculation to split the bill. I didn’t enjoy it because of these « surprises »
2,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazingly cute place in the centre of Amsterdam. Beer for reasonable prices and a wide variety of drinks available. Not very suitable for groups that have more than 5 people. The christmas decorations are really cool and the crazy amounts …
3,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Incredible selection of rums.  Might be easier if they had some sort of menu though.
4,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 1 star ,5 years ago,Unfriendly people... I have never been so badly recieved in a place and I still don't know why. Don't disturb the cat or the boss will bite you! Don't disturb the boss or the waiter will bite you! Don't disturb the waiter and go in another friendly bar. There are so many in the lovely Amsterdam.
5,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Holy booze selection! This is the most stocked bar I've seen. Great staff and fun decor.
6,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Such a cosy cafe with the cutest cat to give you company :)
7,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great bar, chill, and they have a cute cat."
8,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing rum selection, amongst other spirits if your into trying new stuff. Best place for selection I found."
9,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing staff! While on a girls trip we realized we were being followed and jump into this place. When I told the person working there he went and guarded the front of the restaurant while the men following us circled the place and then left. Spent the rest of the night there having drinks and getting tips from the owner.
10,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is seriously so cute! Whenever I've been there it was never crowded, nice, chill atmosphere and good service (rare in Holland). We go there because it's so quiet and relaxed even though it's a busy area. …"
11,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Authentic bar specialised in rum and wine with skilled and friendly staff
It has over 500 different kinds of rum from all over the world and if you like a good glass of affordable quality wine then this is one of the few cafes in …"
12,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The atmosphere here is really great. The people behind the bar are always friendly and know how to make your evening even better. The prices are good, especially for this location. This is a bar which is great for us local Amsterdammers as well as tourists as it is not too touristy and truly brings the spirit of Amsterdam across."
13,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We stopped by to sit and have a drink and watch the people of Amsterdam walk by. Had a wine and a beer (from the excellent Dutch brewery of Broweurij TJ.. hope I got that right!). Service is of the norm you expect in a big city, I particularly liked the interiors though, had a lot of character."
14,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice staff, quick service, good prices, great burger."
15,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Stopped in for a drink with my boyfriend and had a very unpleasant experience. Owner/employee was very uptight and unwelcoming, he practically shoved us out of the door when we were just trying to have a relaxing drink. Thought the decor/atmosphere was quirky but it was ruined by the bad experience. Wouldn't go back!"
16,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 1 star ,7 years ago,I went with some international friends to this place on a Saturday night. Who seemed to be the owner of the bar asked us where were we from and we said Spain (though we were a big group of some other nationalities). He started to say …

18,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Aptly called the Frank Sinatra bar. Amazing decor, friendly service and great tunes to boot. The drink selection is quite extensive, be it scotch, rum, cognac, beer or cocktails."
19,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Mint tea was alright, extensive selection of drinks, cozy café. Warm IR lamps for sitting outdoors were available. What could be improved was that the cat lying on a chair bit me and that never happens. Perhaps it had a bad day. It still made the experience a little less pleasant."
20,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Café 't Spui-tje is a very cozy and friendly bar where you'll feel right at home. The owner is a real Sinatra fan, and the décor really shows that; lots of memorabilia such as gold records, posters and autographed items. Besides Sinatra, …"
21,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,10 years ago,"Great bar, lots of Sinatra memorabilia.  Owner is a fantastic bar tender and the other bar tenders are very friendly.  This is a great place to stop for a cold beer and good camaraderie."
22,Caf√© 't Spui -tje, 5 stars ,9 years ago,Awesome and friendly bar with really a lot of inspiration of Frank Sinatra and friends. Football live on two big screens- outside and inside very nice personal also.
