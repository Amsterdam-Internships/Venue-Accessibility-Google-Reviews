0,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The meat itself is not necessarily better than most other places. The bread however is delicious. In normal times you can also add as much sauce as you'd like, so it's never too soggy or dry when eating in. For special occasions they make a very nice k√∂fte as well on the charcoal grill. Lahmacun is fine here as well."
1,Leeman D√∂ner, 2 stars ,4 months ago,I honestly don‚Äôt understand how people can call this the best doner in Amsterdam. I ordered a broodje doner and the meat didn‚Äôt have ANY taste at all. The bread itself was nice though.
2,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,a month ago,Best doner in Amsterdam. just a pity that it is always so busy and long wait.
3,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Been loving Leeman for 10+ years and will keep doing so! A must go if you want a nice d√∂ner
4,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Probably the best doner i had in Amsterdam. Baklava wasn't too bad. It was cheap by Dutch standards.
5,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,There are doner places and then there is place - excellent tasting food and very good bang for your dollar (euro). They also have the durum doner (pita style bread that they bake on the spot for you)
6,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Very tasty kebab and baklava ! Will be back for sure ‚ò∫Ô∏è
7,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Great spiced meat, sauce taste homemade."
8,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It's good, nothing out of the ordinary just some good d√∂nner and Turkish Pizza."
9,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,4 months ago,One of the tastiest d√∂ners I have ever had!!!
10,Leeman D√∂ner, 1 star ,a year ago,"This D√∂ner was hyped for me to be the best D√∂ner in Amsterdam. If this really is the best D√∂ner, then I feel bad for the people that live here.
My D√∂ner consisted of meat, lettuce and their sauce on top (very little sauce) . ‚Ä¶"
11,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice d√ºr√ºm with really good bread and tasty meat (chicken). Nicely balanced with the souce üëå
12,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious d√∂ner and extremely affordable! I got the chicken d√∂ner sandwich combo (sandwich + can of soda) for 4 euro!
13,Leeman D√∂ner, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Nice service, friendly people. Although the wrap in the shoarma was not fried and tasted of flour, a bit like eating dough. Also there was quite too much onion and not enough sauce. Overall, ok for a quick bite on the way, yet could still be improved."
14,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I bought a Turkish pizza, a kapsalon and a baklawa from this outlet. The food was very delicious even after it became cold. The quality of meat was good. The place was small and very crowded. However, their service was very quick. The staff were courteous. I would definitely recommend this place for Turkish food in Amsterdam."
15,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Netherlands Netherlands Netherlands
Amsterdam Amsterdam Amsterdam
The Best Doner Kebab From The World !!!!. ‚Ä¶"
16,Leeman D√∂ner, 3 stars ,11 months ago,"Good durum but totally overpriced !! 8‚Ç¨ is unbelievable for a durum (no excuses for the location, I can find a durum on Ferdinand Bolstraat for 4,5‚Ç¨ and it's better)"
17,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A good, fairly priced meal. There is a chance for a queue, be prepared to wait a bit for the food. Good ingredients, not too much space to eat in (only 5-6 seats inside and 5 chairs outside), but that's not a major issue. Veal is very good. Fully recommend!"
18,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good doner but not the best I have tasted.
19,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Best Turkish kebab outside Turkey ever.  And better than most of Turkish ones there!
They make their own bread,  and it is fantastic.  My daughter does not eat fast food,  and she hates kebab...  Until I took it home from Leeman."
20,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This was great when i was there. I supose its always great. Even when i'm somewhere else. The product they sell is doner kebab and is meant to be eaten and that is what i did. If you want to eat something you can go to this place and eat one or more of their products.
21,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good price and excelent Kapsalon!
22,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I had a durum there, fresh rotis were made in front on me. Service was very quick and staff was friendly too. For tasty and fresh durum this place is highly recommended."
23,Leeman D√∂ner, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"This used to be a good place to eat but lately my experiences have not been good. The pita with chicken/lamb doner they serve is poorly filled with meat, they fill it with loads of unions and greens. Also I asked them to fill the bread with ‚Ä¶"
24,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Crowded, not super good for vegetarians. Can recommend the vegetarian Turkish pizza but not the falafel, frozen and of bad quality.
Meat eater friends loved the meat options."
25,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best kebabs I've ever had! They make their own bread which is delicious. The durum kebab reminds me of shawarmas from the middle East. Good prices and friendly staff too!
26,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Is it just me or I feel like this is the best Doner place in Amsterdam? Very tasty, high quality, and fully stuffed Doners And Durums could be found here, they also sell baklava which is delicious, the only problem is that its very hot inside during summer, but fine for winter üòÖ"
27,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Admittedly I haven‚Äôt eaten a ton of Doner Kebabs in Amsterdam, so hard to say it is the best.  But it is really good.  I always get the Turkish pizza wrap with chicken.  Fresh and flavorful!"
28,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"They make their own pita bread, which makes a huge difference. Meat was so tasty, veggies very fresh. If they just had ice for the coke it would've been perfect :)"
29,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Having seen the amazing reviews I tried to fit this place in my extremely tight schedule and I would say it was totally worth it. I had a dish, suggested by my friend kapsalan and I wanted to make sure I went to a good place to try this particular must-have dish. Leeman doner was definitely a place up to the reviews I read about it."
30,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good place for d√∂ners. We liked them a lot. My wife had never had one before and was impressed. They also sold Dr. Pepper, which made my wife shout for joy. Good place, with friendly people."
31,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Paid ‚Ç¨2.50 for a full kebab with salad and garlic mayo and ‚Ç¨1.50 for a somewhat small tray of fries but not a disappointing amount to accompany the kebab. So a full and filling meal for ‚Ç¨4 is a steal in my opinion. You probably wouldn't even get the bread for that much in the centre of town!
32,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First of all the food was delicious, I just had to go back for a second round. Secondly the price, you can get a full stomach for just three euros. The staff was very friendly and after the many recurring visits we bonded quite well. ‚Ä¶"
33,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Easily the best D√∂ner around in Amsterdam.
Great sense of taste, quality of ingredients is the best I have seen. Quick service even when busy."
34,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,First class Turkish pizza's and Durum rolls. Good enough for serious lines of people waiting. Friendly atmosphere in a family driven business. Highly recommended.
35,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Had a veal durum, fresh home baked bread and meat, great taste ! Fries were good but could be more tasty."
36,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Classic small diner. Serves doner and Kapsalon and other stuff in that category you would normally find in a small Arabic/Turkish diner. ‚Ä¶
37,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome d√∂ner for cheap! You will get a super authentic german d√∂ner for 3-6 Euro. It‚Äôs not a great place to eat, because it‚Äôs just like a pick up bar.
Get the Turkish pizza with meat, they prepare it freshly that day! You can also order on ubereats, but it‚Äôs more expensive. But for the lazy ones it‚Äôs perfect."
38,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Medium d√∂ner, but probably best in Amsterdam."
39,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Simply one of the best kebabs in Amsterdam. Definitely top 3, and I tried them all :)"
40,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome food, they serve kapsalon by default with cheese and at 6 euros for the large size. I came all the way from central station, looking at the reviews here and it was ‚ÄòWorth the visit‚Äô."
41,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Best kebab street food in amsterdam. Simple filling and tasty. Low priced too. They make their own bread. Expect a long queue at lunch n dinner hours. But they serve quickly especially if its donner broodje (sandwich) that you order. Durum takes more time.
42,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This place is actually amazing, they have the best bread, there might be a line but its cuz its good."
43,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, they make the bread themselves. Extremely friendly staff.
Very wide range of customers, the entire neighbourhood seems to love these broodjes kebab."
44,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Best D√∂ner and Durum in Amsterdam,  amazing mix between quality and price. Great spinach and cheese borek and baklava as well. Do not miss out if you are in Amsterdam."
45,Leeman D√∂ner, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"No idea where the good reviews come from, maybe it was better in the past? What i ate was a  tasteless bit of meat with some salad and onions in tasteless bread. Nothing compared to german style kebabs"
46,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely delicious!!! They're now on ubereats! They have very tasty buns and sauces that they make themselves. They also serve various mixes of chicken and lamb meat. You can customize the Turkish pizza with chicken/lamb meat, salad and ‚Ä¶"
47,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Great food amazing quality and very nice costemer services üëå keep it up
48,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Seriously one of the BEST doners I've had.  Friendly staff.  They work in a VERY hot area and still maintain a smile.  üëç Why can't we have these types of places in the States..üôÑ
49,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came here for a quick bite while visiting Amsterdam. Some of the best food I've ever eaten and a great hidden gem in Amsterdam . Highly recommend!
50,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A very nice kebab place, the kapsalons are very good. When I go to the pijp I usually have kebab from this place. Because it is a small place, I do not eat it there though."
51,Leeman D√∂ner, 1 star ,3 years ago,Even one star is to much I will explain the reason first they serve you and treats you like garbage they look to take you money fast and that‚Äôs it others one i specific I work also delivery I have been I a lot of fast food like this but ‚Ä¶
52,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best D√∂ner place in this part of the city, friendly, fast and most importantly extremely delicious"
53,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Delicious d√∂ner, arguably the best in town."
54,Leeman D√∂ner, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"quantity-average, ambience-below average, cleanliness average, quality of meat average ( was dry inside and chewy)& greacy.. appeared as if it was made greacy using oil or fat, It was smelling bad inside the shop (i could see it from the ‚Ä¶"
55,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Struggling to find a better kebab in Amsterdam than Leemans! Always popular.. I need to start running more to justify the number of kebabs I get from here!
56,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,5 years ago,No nonsense kebab; they do the most delicious kapsalon kebab and it's really cheap too. Definitely worth a trip out of Central via number 4 tram.
57,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice home baked buns
58,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is great and very good for it's price! Would have been nicer if there was more places to sit, sometimes too crowded."
59,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely the best place to grab doner kebab in the whole of Amsterdam! If only it was a little bit bigger, cause 90% of the time, there‚Äôs no place to sit."
60,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's always packed  I think is one of the best Donner's  in Amsterdam. I recommend not to eat there, get it to take away and go to the park."
61,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,5 years ago,they say this is the best kebab place in Amsterdam... super busy and kind of small... a kebab costs somewhere between 3.50 and 4.60 euros... you can order extra meat or cheese for 1 euro
62,Leeman D√∂ner, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Compared to proper doner, this js really something else for me."
63,Leeman D√∂ner, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good shawarma overall. The fried potatoes are terrible to say the least...and they don't really know how to mix stuff
64,Leeman D√∂ner, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food was ok but the costumer service was terrible. I ordered the doner with mixed extra meat extra cheese but i was eating and i didnt c the other meat i was like ok never coming back. I dont recommend this shop to anyone.
65,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Very tasty kebab. Cheap as well!
66,Leeman D√∂ner, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Its ok but there are definitely better places in the area, with faster service and fresher products. But worth stopping by if you are around."
67,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best doner kebab and Turkish pizza in town. A small family business with good quality food. A must
68,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very simple but the food was amazing. They speak very good English too so there would be no mixing up your order.
69,Leeman D√∂ner, 2 stars ,a year ago,Nice staff but you won't pay if you don't have cash or credit card from Netherlands.
70,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best turkse pizza in Amsterdam! Pls don't increase the prices anymore tho...:(
71,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Best doner
72,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best I've had since being in Israel. Prepare to wait in line if you are going during the warm months but it will be well worth the wait.
73,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good although could do with more vegtables. Everything was of excellent quality though, especially the bread (which is made fresh on the premises)"
74,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Arguably one of the best doner in Amsterdam. The number of queueing people during lunch and dinner speaks for itself.
75,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Small turkish snack bar without toilet. Kapsalon was fresh, yumm and cheap! As far best in the city"
76,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"A hidden gem, delicious delicious delicious!!!"

Ambience:- 1/5 üòû ‚Ä¶"
81,Leeman D√∂ner, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The kebab in here always looks amazing, but the man can be a bit grumpy and it's fairly crowded in a small space."
82,Leeman D√∂ner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty good food. You will feel like the cashier talks to you  a bit rude but I think he just struggles with English
83,Leeman D√∂ner, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Was a very good place but in the last few years the quality of the food dropped alot. the food is way to moist
84,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,a year ago,Always deliver... best done kebab in Amsterdam
85,Leeman D√∂ner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best place in the Pijp area to get doner, has been for years now. Cheap, fast, and delicous."
