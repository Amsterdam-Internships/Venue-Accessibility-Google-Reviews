0,Mexico Boulevard, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious beyond expectations! All of the food is delightfully tasty and the dishes are nothing short of gigantic. The staff is also super friendly and helpful, making the experience complete. Fully recommended for a nice dinner or a meeting with a group of friends!"
1,Mexico Boulevard, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Very friendly staff with an authentic looking decor.
I had the raspberry margarita which tasted mostly like Sourpuss. We also had the tacos al pastor and barbacoa (17 euro each) - very pricy and not very flavorful â€¦"
2,Mexico Boulevard, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The BEST Mexican food experience Iâ€™ve ever had! Thank you Perla and Nic and the whole staff!
3,Mexico Boulevard, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A nicely decorated restaurant serving dishes with a surprising taste. It's good. Worthwhile to try out.
4,Mexico Boulevard, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I had tried all the so-called top Mexican spots in Amsterdam and gone home missing tacos until I found Mexican Boulevard. Authentically fantastic Mexican food. Amazingly friendly service. Worth a 20-minute bike ride in the rain. This place â€¦
5,Mexico Boulevard, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Best Mexican we've had in Amsterdam. Great flavours. Try the sopes, pibil, grasshopper tacos... In fact anything! It's all good"
6,Mexico Boulevard, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, it definitely has a more authentic feeling than the other I've tried in town before, they have a nice terrace I would like to come back with better weather to try it out. Also nice selection of Mexican beers although only one on â€¦"
7,Mexico Boulevard, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good good food a bit expensive but I can overlook it since I almost had to undo my button that I was so full. Nice decorations but I guess we did not catch them on their best day, which was a bit disappointing since we've read their service â€¦"
8,Mexico Boulevard, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"A pretty good place for tacos.

Myself and a few friends decided to stop here on a whim, and we had a pretty â€¦"
9,Mexico Boulevard, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Disappointing!!! I was expecting real mexican, but what we got was something else! If you order tacos, you get a portion of 5 tacos, all the same, the menu explicitly tells you cannot mix flavors, it gets very boring! Mexican food should be â€¦"
10,Mexico Boulevard, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is good, tried few dishes and they're close to real Mexican food, little less tasty version but for Europe it's quite good. What takes 2 stars away is: one, I know the food, I'm native Mexican and there's no way a tlayuda costs 18 euros! That's 3 days pay in Mexican lower income families! And 2, it gets quite noisy."
11,Mexico Boulevard, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Decent tacos (a little heavy on the meat). Amazing chimichanga. Horrible guacamole. Good chips. A decent experience if you're in the neighborhood, but still on the search for amazing Mexican food in Amsterdam."
12,Mexico Boulevard, 2 stars ,4 years ago,We ate here last year and were really looking forward to it but were very disappointed. The portions were tiny and the carnitas tasted like shoarma. It came recommended by a Mexican colleague but was a far cry from the delicious California Mexican food I grew up eating.
13,Mexico Boulevard, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Okay food, but way too expensive. I ordered a main course of about 18.50 and i wasn't full at all. That's wrong. My friend wasnt full either. What do you want me to do: get another main course? Or get a snack at home to fill me up? The food â€¦"
14,Mexico Boulevard, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is wonderful. I felt as if they had the best tacos I have ever tasted!!! Which is weird because I wouldn't think I would find such great mexican food in Amsterdam considering I live closer to Mexico.Get the Sheperd
15,Mexico Boulevard, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Not the best Mexican restaurant. Some dishes can be acceptable like the mole. Some others are truly bad. In general all the food is very blend. Something is missing. A new chef maybe?
16,Mexico Boulevard, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Bad experience ,
We are living in the area and we wanted to try this restaurant ,
So we have been there in Tuesday this week , â€¦"
17,Mexico Boulevard, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Authentic Mexican food that we have been missing here in Amsterdam. Margaritas are fabulous, our waiter was oober charming and the chef's have done a fabulous job creating the menu! Delish!"
18,Mexico Boulevard, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Decided to try this place last night, the food was delicious and the portions were very generous. Excellent service from their mexicaans staff. Also very very good margaritas en mojitos. Overall great experience."
19,Mexico Boulevard, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was good but not incredible, the service was ok but also not amazing. Our server wasn't the friendliest, not rude or anything but the service was a let down. In conclusion we were expecting a more exciting experience with both the food and service. Still the prices are fair and the menu has many options."
20,Mexico Boulevard, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"After living in Mexico for some time it was quite refreshing to discover fresh and genuine Mexican taste in Amsterdam. Great hosts, beautiful design, what else can you wish for a Mexican night out. Muchas Gracias!"
21,Mexico Boulevard, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"One of the best mexican restaurants in Amsterdam. Excellent decoration! Excellent margaritas. Try the pastor tacos but, watch out the spicy sauces!"
22,Mexico Boulevard, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great Mexican food and drinks in a cozy neighborhood location. Plenty of vegetarian options, excellent corn tortillas, and decor that's fun without being a Mexico stereotype."
23,Mexico Boulevard, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Simply amazing. Big fan of Mexican food, this ties a place I found in southern Spain for the best Mexican food I've tried on this side of the Atlantic."

26,Mexico Boulevard, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Good choice of tequila and food (in general). I went also for Independence Day and they had a fixed menu that was horrible. I would return only when the actual menu is available
