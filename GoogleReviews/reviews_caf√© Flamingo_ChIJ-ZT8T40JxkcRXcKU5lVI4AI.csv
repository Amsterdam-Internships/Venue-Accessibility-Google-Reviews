The service was great and staff was nice

1,caf√© Flamingo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,We had some drinks here and it was really nice. Outside they had a heating. Inside it is quite small but cute.
2,caf√© Flamingo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I went there on my vacation and it was super chill 'n nice. Would recommend this bar. Also try the beer tasting if you'd like to test the Amsterdam's local Breweries' beers. Lynn the bartender was really nice! Thanks for the cool evening. 😊
3,caf√© Flamingo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lots of fun vibes. Energetic crowd coupled with loads of great beers. Best on a summer night when the bar spills out on the street and catches everyone going by. Get the funky falcon. Highly recommend.

12,caf√© Flamingo, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Nice staff and a good spot for a quick drink
13,caf√© Flamingo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of my favorite bars in de pijp neighborhood. Good local craft beer and not too many tourists walk in. Order the snack plates! Excellent raw ox sausage / ossenworst.
14,caf√© Flamingo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Terrible quality, needs a cleaning and too close to the fish market .. The rudeness of a person that could have been the manager made me to believe its one place not worth visiting at all. To summarize, if you got an important date, never ever go there"
