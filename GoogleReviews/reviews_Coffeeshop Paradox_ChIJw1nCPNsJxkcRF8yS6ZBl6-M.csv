0,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,the best space cakes in amsterdam! they taste delicious and are VERY strong (1gr per slice) for only 7€. You might want to consider eating only half if you're not a regular user though. The staff is also really friendly and will help you if you're not sure about how much you should take.
1,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Little Shop near the Anne Frank house. Good prices all over nice quality.  Also most potent cs space cakes.  Always worth to visit

5,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Excellent small shop with a nice choice. Staff are the best. We visited Cheeky Monday on our last night and had to wait 10 hours before our flight back the next day, safe to say we stayed in here for a good few hours that day."

12,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,4 years ago,They are recommend for their edibles. Nice location and well decorated. Made nice chill break
13,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,a month ago,"The cake is very strong, I recommend !"
14,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The best space cake in Amsterdam; very chill & calm with an open and airy atmosphere. Unlike many of the dark and dank pot-cafés.
15,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,8 months ago,More friendly than your average coffee shop and great mix of regulars and visitors. Known for the cake which is really popular

18,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best of cakes! Space cake forever! Space cake forever!! If you eat the whole cake, you will be filled with very interesting feelings."
19,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"As people before me said, it might be the best place to get some space cakes, which are tasty and potent. It took me solid 2 hours for them to kick in, the effect was quite noticable, but not too strong, and it lasted quite a few hours. …"
20,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I really like this place and it has probably the best cake in Amsterdam! A nice and relaxed atmosphere, where you can smoke and let the world go by! Everything I have had from here has been a good smoke, nothing that knocks you for six but …"
21,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice staff and atmosphere. Only giving it 4 stars because the space cake didn't get us high at all! They recommended 1 cake for 2 people but it should've been 1 per person. Other than that,  it's an amazing place!"
22,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Löööööve strong space cakes. 1gr 🙌🤯
23,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Best Coffeeshop in Amsterdam. Remember to BUY Bitcoin.
24,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My go to coffeeshop for when I am in the dam. Great prices and just far enough out of town that it isn't overly touristy. Space cake is the best I've had, 1g per cake and the joints are not badly priced. Always a great atmosphere and the staff are very helpful if you have any questions. Number 1 coffee shop to go to."
25,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Can't go wrong with the edibles, for sure. Renowned throughout Amsterdam, they're very potent but it's easy to dose correctly. Otherwise, great cheerful atmosphere: someone was playing chess when I just went in! Come everytime I'm here."
26,Coffeeshop Paradox, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Tried edibles for the first time here, read lots of good reviews and thought this would be the best place to go. It turns out not to be the way the reviews describe it though, the place was completely full, clouds of smoke and the staff …"
27,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice coffee shop with really good cake and great atmosphere in the neighborhood
28,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place is great because it’s really low key and non assuming. They have a good selection and of course they are known for their very strong space cakes. I went back twice for them because it does taste really good and it is as …
29,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Didn't stay for a smoke, but it seemed to have a nice vibe. The poundcake was nice, but not as super strong as I'd been led to believe, but they still packed a bit of a punch. Nice place, I'd recommend it as an alternative to the more touristy coffeeshops and it's not too far from lots of places."
30,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Visited here for the second time.
Located in a nice area on a quiet side street near the Westerkerk and Anne Frank house.  The staff have been pleasant on both occasions.  Struck up a nice …"
31,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had a great time here! Met a couple at our table enjoyed some coffee and a smoke. They have a great selection on the menu as well; as strong or mild as you would like.
32,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Nice & cozy place with relaxed atmosphere and really good stuff!
33,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Chilled vibe, you can walk in and start talking to anyone. Been to a range of coffee shops but this one is definitely my favourite! The owner is lovely too! Best space cakes around for the best price. Can't beat it."
34,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Best edible in town, hands down! (Do follow the instructions on the packaging if you haven't had their cake before!) Decent varieties, but not as wide of a selection as other coffeeshops around.  But seriously though, best cake in Amsterdam!"
35,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best space cakes in Amsterdam. The guy told me to just buy 1 cake ( 6 euros)
For 3 peopme and he was right, those are surprisingly strong (1 gram per cake). …"
36,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Am visiting from California and I’ve been to five other coffee shops in the center of Amsterdam and this place is the absolute best!  The Paradox is not pretentious like the other shops this one is chill and pleasant.  It goes along way!
37,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice staff and a very cool selection of stuff. They are very forthcoming and helpful. It is also a nice place to stay during smoking/vaping. Good prices, I did not feel ripped off like in other shops. …"
38,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really a good place to relax, prices are reasonable and the staff are friendly. Would definitely recommend"
39,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Seems to be cozy, we didn't spend any time inside since we only wanted to buy the Space Cake but the lady that sold it to us was very nice and for budget tight people (students) the price for the potency was amazing! If I ever visit Amsterdam again, I will try to spend my time and money here!"
40,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you're looking to go to space eating some edibles, look no further, for you have found the place. This coffee-shop has the most potent edibles you can find in Amsterdam. Cozy place, decent selection of merchandise and a staff that's helpful."
41,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cash only!!!!
Nice chilled place to sit have a cup of coffee, smoke and mingle with the people you're sitting with. …"
42,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Got some space cakes. First day took half and felt something after 2 hrs. Was like a light high. Next day I ate 3/4 of it and got really good. Walked around for 2 hrs and spent the next 2 hrs in my hotel room. Don't get the soft pure joint, you won't feel much of it."
43,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely brilliant service and great atmosphere! Their pound cake is fantastic and very strong. Paradox made my time in Amsterdam so much fun :)
44,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great space cake, but a bit too weak. I had two slices and barely felt the effect. Snacks are pretty good and they have a Volcano in case you want to use. Very chill out."
45,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,a year ago,This is my 1st stop when arriving from the state's... Quant and relaxing. Not all the glitz and glam which is perfect for a mellow chill spot. And the music is  fantastic along with the menu choices👍👍👍
46,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Cake is the best. They have plenty of other supplies and paraphernalia to enjoy them with as well, although we just tried the cake. and then came back for more in the following days! Bonus-- the content of their cakes is WAY more than any …"
47,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Visited this little place with some friends on a recent visit. Chose a pre rolled white widow tobacco and had the best smooth high from it. Only €3.50 and far better qualitythan the one costing twice that from a more commercial place over on rembrantplein where we were staying. Would definitely visit this cracking coffee shop again.
48,Coffeeshop Paradox, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Shame it hadn't lived up to my expectations from friends who had recommended it. Nice people. Seemed like the only thing in the hash was tobacco which they obviously only sell to tourists. wasn't even any weed in the 'joint' so It had no effect. I'm not a frequent smoker but have done so in the past.
49,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good prices for greens, at least when I went. It’s organised like an actual cafe, it’s very relaxed and peaceful therefore making it a great place to catch up with a friend over some of the devils lettuce. …"
50,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Cute place with good prices and strong stuff. Highly recommend
51,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,a year ago,"If you want a quiet smoke away from all the English/German dudes in white T-shirts and silly bags; come here. Friendly, good prices and great weed."
52,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Yup, while in Amsterdam you have to take in the local delicacies  and I heard this was a pretty decent place so gave it a go. Potent cakes, wrapped and labelled with directions on how to eat, took just over an hour to kick in for me and lasted quite a a while so pleased with my purchase 👌"
53,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely nice!
5€ deals are awesome! Makes it possible to try every strain in a short time.
It is easy to find but in a nice calm area. …"
54,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Perfect spot for some chill volcano vaporizer. Nice art on the wall and pleasant service.
55,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,3 years ago,My first place ever wherr I could enjoy a.smoke and not feel like a criminal for doing so.  I love ld the atmosphere of local folks who stop for a smoke during their busy luves.  Reasonably priced weed with excellent quality.  Space Cakes are awesome.
56,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"We came across Paradox by pure chance. It is simply a very cozy and nice cafe, with great coffee that happens to have a great range of weed and very strong cake, 1gr per slice. The atmosphere was really nice, very friendly service and It has some great grass. what more could you want."
57,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"A really cosy shop, with a really relaxed atmosphere, not like some of the shops more geared towards hard stoners. Having said that, with the cakes at 1g (rather than 0.4g which is more common elsewhere) and a Volcano Vaporizer in the …"
58,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,4 years ago,1g spacecakes and the choice of 0.4g draws so you can try more strains 👍🏽👍🏽
59,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Situated in a mainly residential area of the Jordaan, and off the beaten track, so to speak, Paradox Coffeeshop is mostly frequented by locals, although some tourists do make the effort to seek it out mostly due to its reputation as having …"
60,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I tried edibles from 4 different coffeeshops while here, but only the spacecakes from paradox had a really good effect on me. Would absolutely recommend the spacecakes, good vibe inside too."
61,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome place, has 4 Volcano's, my new home away from home.  Staff is very friendly and space cakes are the best in Amsterdam."
62,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing space cake. Not expensive and super sensations
Careful, don't do like us and have an entire piece at once, too strong !"
63,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Best space cake ever
64,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Here in Amsterdam reminscing backpacking days.... Paradox is a must visit! We're retired now.. The staff was incredibly helpful and patient- We asked a lot of questions- our goal- smooth high that lasts- we don't smoke-  we ended up with  1 …
65,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Not too difficult to get to if you're anywhere near the Anne Frank House. The space cakes are a must try and they have a very chilled out vibe going on. Exactly everything you'd want from a coffee shop.
66,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice cannabis store and coffeeshop with great weed and service and presumably the spacecake with ""1 gram of weed in it"". Very tasty but did not do it for me. Be carefull it closes early 19:30. Take a walk over those 5 bridges to find it. It's not far from the center as you might think from the map. It's a place where locals go."
67,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Nice one!
68,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Fantastic little shop with no BS.   Comfortable seating, music at a level that one can have a good conversation over coffee, nestled off the main track so you don't get too many loud idiots.  Great selection of smoke, and just a good …"
69,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very old and famous coffeshop in amsterdam..but the place is small and joint id cheap but size is small. Loved their joint but bigger space in future will be appreciated.
70,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A very chill place to be! Not expensive 2,6g for 15€ of Bio weed, awesome!), very friendy managers, and their fresh mint tea (2€) taste wonderful.
Oh and the free wifi works great too.
I totally recommend it!"
71,Coffeeshop Paradox, 1 star ,a year ago,"DON'T BUY THEIR JOINTS THEY ARE LITERALLY THIEVES.
I bought a 5€ joint (the most expensive one) and it was worse than CBD, it was like smoking air.....
NOT RECOMENDED"
72,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I like this cafe.
You can find a cozy place to sit with your friend for a long time.
It located in a beautiful alley near canal. …"
73,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice staff, well lit and clean. Even for veteran eatable users, half a space cake is too much for one person. Definitely worth starting with a quarter."
74,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place to chill nice space cakes, needs more than a gram inside of them to mess you up, so would recommend buying a few or 4 to have the best space cake experience."
75,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My Favorite coffeeshop in whole Amsterdam! Great chill atmosphere. Very nice and helpful stuff behind the counter. I'd love to come back there soon.
76,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best in town. Cozy, with nice and friendly staff, WITHOUT LOUD MUSIC. Maybe not the best when the subject is menu variety, but it is nice to spend some time there. It seems less touristic and more of a locals place."
77,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Awesome little coffeeshop :) very relaxing atmosphere and awesome products 👌
78,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Best cakes in Amsterdam.  Staff was always kind and even showed me how to use a volcano vaporizer. …
79,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place is perfect! Vaporizers,good prices and good drinks! Very laid back and cool atmosphere. They have card games, wifi, milkshakes, coffees and teas. Very good quality in greens. This place is a must!!!"
80,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want space cake come here, lovely staff and half a cake was enough. Never done anything like this before, but the experience was worth it and we had a great night."
81,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We always recieve a warm welcome whenever we visit Paradox, has the best smoke, the best cake and the best drinks in Amsterdam. It is never too busy and feels like a really great place."
82,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the Coffeshops with the best atmosphere i've  ever been to! The Place is cozy and the workers are very polite.
I definitely can recommend the spacecakes."
83,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Haven’t tried weed but space cakes. Probably the only legitimate ones in Amsterdam. Closes early around 8. Only bad thing
84,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Not one of the best but feel like you're local here as the owners are two older seniors. Have to mention about the space cake **it's a 1g space cake** not like other place is about 0.4g worth have a try but I felt nothing tbh
85,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cool place. The cakes are nice. No credit card (dec/17).
Chill vibe. From smooth electronic to mariachi.
Not the mainstream crowd, some locals."
86,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Quite a homelike and snug-esque coffeeshop, on arrival the owner who was eager to help suggested strains to pick which made it more comfortable. Seating was okay, there were cushions to greet my fatigued body but still a bit stiff, the …"
87,Coffeeshop Paradox, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, good prices, hight quality products. Not very gentel staff. I saw how one of sales staff leted down weed-roll to dirty floor, than lift it up and packed to tube for sale. Maybe not the cleanest coffeshop in Amsterdam."
88,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super cool shop. Affordable and fair prices. Cool and tasty juices and milkshakes.
Extremly nice atmosphere and nice touch with games under the tables. Also nice …"
89,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,a year ago,Fair price and really good quality. I can really recommend their space cakes.
90,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Just take all my money
91,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Seems to be a good coffee shop for grown ups. If you're a good 10-15 years away from being 18, come to this place. Brought some cake home for my mates; deliciously potent stuff."
92,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy place to relax and cool art on the walls.
Potentially potent space cake, but had very varied results. Not many places to sit."
93,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,4 years ago,We were in and out of the place pretty fast since we just grabbed a space cake to go. Seemed like a nice place. Their space cake is the most potent around or so I've heard
94,Coffeeshop Paradox, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The cake was not as strong as expected; we tried it following the instructions, 1/4 on the first day with no effect. So I tried 1/2 on the next day, but nothing happened either... may need to try the whole slice at one take next time!"
95,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Fast, helpful, awesome quality! Will be going back today for some more of that dank-ass cake!!"
96,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Insane. Space Cakes were on point! Super balanced and mellow experience with just half of slice. I could not imagine eating a whole one...Cash only!
97,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"it is one of the coffeshops which we felt most comfortable in. friendly staff & friendly customer profile. you can find tasty drinks, enjoy the music in this naturally ventilated and enlightened cosy place."
98,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely coffeeshop with good rates and quality weed. They also do very tasty and potent space cake. Highly recommended
99,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The pure rolled joint which gives a natural high is some really good stuff. The atmosphere is chilled out. Would love to return and have more.
100,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"BEST BUD CAKES IN AMSTERDAM!!! 1G PER SLICE!!!
and a lovely lady running it. Didnt buy weed here but was a nice place to smoke."
101,Coffeeshop Paradox, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"If you’re a very heavy smoker (example, heavy dabber from Colorado) make sure to buy more than one. Label says if you’ve never smoked eat a quarter of the Bar, take that into consideration. To eat before my flight home, I wish I would have purchased multiple instead of just one."
102,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favorite coffee shop in Amsterdam. Reasonable prices, great atmosphere, great fresh orange juice, hot chocolate, and definitely the best space in cakes in town"

106,Coffeeshop Paradox, 5 stars ,4 months ago,🖤
107,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"6.5 euros per slice. As instructed, I took a quarter as it was my first time trying space cake; felt nothing after 2 hours. The next day I ate the rest altogether and after 2 hours the effect kicked in."
108,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice coffee shop, nice service, good variety, cool artwork drawn on walls and menus along with canvases hanging great if you like your art"
109,Coffeeshop Paradox, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Nice little cosy place space cakes are amazing weed is beautiful and cheap because it's a bit out from the city centre but worth a visit

111,Coffeeshop Paradox, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Cool cafe in the area. Some room to chill and order something to drink. Fair prices and loads of table board games to play. Good product as well.
