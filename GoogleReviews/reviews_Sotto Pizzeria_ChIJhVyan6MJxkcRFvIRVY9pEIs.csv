4,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,a month ago,"The only reason this place pulls crowd is, it is at prime location and with closures people don't have choices in nearby area. The pizza was mediocre for amount of price we paid. Staff was unmasked and had no regard for customer safety. In ‚Ä¶"
5,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Fine place for a pizza. However, outside you can't sit with a back rest so it's not very comfortable. Service is good and the pizza was nice. We did find the dough quite salty."

10,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent authentic Italian Neapolitan style pizza. Wood fired oven, olive oil from Italy, Italian 00 caputo flour, are all why this pizza is so excellent. The dough is soft and chewy like it should be. I would eat here every day if I ‚Ä¶"
11,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great attentive service, delicious pizza, clean and fun atmosphere.  Recommend the carnivals salisicca if you are looking for the star effect on your pizza.

15,Sotto Pizzeria, 3 stars ,6 months ago,We were excited to try this place. We went there Saturday around 5PM august 21. There was a blond server that just seemed to be very unhappy to be there. She was treating everyone like the client is bothering her. We almost left.  Luckily ‚Ä¶

20,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent pizza and dessert! Friendly staff, quaint atmosphere, and welcoming environment.

22,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best pizza I ever had! I wish I could eat there every day. I had the quattro staggioni pizza and it was great!

26,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good pizza! Not the best I have eaten but quality oven. The waiters could be a little more friendly especially when it isn't that busy.

28,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Perfect for bigger groups. Very good pizza made in a proper oven.
29,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,a month ago,Unmasked staff asks customers to wear a mask. When we asked if they didn't need to wear a mask the lady just shrugged. Way to be an example ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëèüèΩ
30,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The pizzas were really nice with some different flavors. The only problem for me, as a traveler who pays lots of taxes shopping abroad in credit cards, is that they only accept cards =/"

34,Sotto Pizzeria, 2 stars ,8 months ago,Looks better in the pictures than I reality. Very average yet pretends to be high quality by using D.O.P mozzarella. Service wasn‚Äôt good and they didn‚Äôt serve us any water. The kitchen service looked chaotic.
35,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very friendly staff and good Neapolitan pizza. Very few beer selection
36,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The pizza was very good, nice and soft dough and good ingredients. Recommend to book a table for dinner since if you come after 7pm everything is normally reserved. We came early so were still able to sit."

The tiramis√π was not delivered and the pizza received was literally uneatable ‚Ä¶"
38,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place with kind service. Pizza is good and with good ingredients. Definitely above the average in Amsterdam. Also tiramisu is nice and this was a surprise. Better than many places in Italy.

42,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Absolutely incredible authentic Italian pizza so quick and delicious! I cannot recommend them enough!
43,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Opened in November of 2017. This wood fired pizzeria has authentic Italian style and feel just steps away from the central district. Serving very locally brewed beer from just down the way.
44,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Killer options and really delightful staff. The pesto drizzle on white was the favorite, but I doubt you could go wrong with the ecclectic menu!"
45,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very good pizzas & very quick service. We said we had a plane to catch & we got the pizza less than 5 minutes later. It was perfect
46,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Delicious thin pizza, and lovely friendly staff. 4 years of being a loyal customer. Sotto forever and beyond."
47,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"We had an amazing experience at Sotto. Not only is the pizza delicious, but the service was outstanding. The waitress and chef went out of their way to accomodate our veggetarian preferences, and were overall very friendly. We're coming back for sure!"

52,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best Panini ever if you are near Sotto then make sure you try it out and if you are not near here then ask yourself why not this is a must.

58,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful pizza, tasty beers, good prices! Had the prosciutto and it was really nice. A good size. Can't fault this place at all. Also someone had a balloon shaped like a sausage dog in the restaurant, as it was their birthday. Really added to the ambiance"
59,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I ordered a pizza and this is what I received. It went straight to the trash. Anyone has the number of ""Kitchen Nightmares ? . A pizza from a supermarket looks and tastes better than that."
60,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Picked-up two undercooked pizza's, cheese didn't bind because of how undercooked it was. Whole box was soggy once we arrived home. Check the pizza once they go out of the oven."
61,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Been all over the world, and this is the best Pizza me and my wife have ever had"
62,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Wasn't able to grab a table because of covid-19, but the pizza was great! Friendly staff to, specialty the pizzaiolo. The place looks comfy and clean, will definitely pay a visit to have a proper dinner inside when possible."
63,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very good pizza! Fresh ingredients and real italian chef!
64,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,2 years ago,"So disappointing. I am not even sure how both our pizzas had such burnt bubbles and yet parts undercooked at the same time?!  The pepperoni pizza was terribly, terribly salty. The waitress had an unpleasant attitude from the start so we ‚Ä¶"
65,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Found this in the list of top 10 pizza places in Amsterdam. Not one of the best pizza's of my life - the base was too soft and soggy for me, I like it a little crisp and cooked. Otherwise, the taste was not bad. You get exactly what's ‚Ä¶"
66,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Worth going out of your way for if you're in Amsterdam. Best pizza in the Netherlands, hands down!"
67,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious pizzas, found it listed on a Timeout article and tried it out when we stopped in Amsterdam. Would happily go again. Menu was all in Dutch but the waitress happily helped us out with what everything was on the menu. Lovely vibe"
68,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for pizza close to Central, with very Nice staff!"
69,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favorite pizza place in Amsterdam. I really like their pizze. Especially the dough is very good and products they use are fresh and tasty. It can get really crowded so might be cool to book in advance. They have few tables outside also, which is nice in summer. Truffle pizza should be tried!"
70,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Delicious Pizza but the service was a bit slow. Still great experience!
71,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,What a epic pizza place near Amsterdam center! The pizzas are true Napolitan style and are served super fast. ‚Ä¶
72,Sotto Pizzeria, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Quality food, cheese was a little scarce on the pizza however the flavor was excellent on the truffle and anchovy. Would have received a 4/5, however there was a mishap with the waitress and glass was dropped on our table, as well as in my cappuccino. Would have even been a 3/5 but the waiter never wanted to take our dessert order."
73,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went twice, second time was definitely  better.
We were able to squeeze in before a reservation and had plenty of time to finish what we ordered. ‚Ä¶"
74,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The pizzas were delicious, much more authentic tasting than many in Amsterdam. Service was quick. I also tried the brownie off the dessert menu and it was delicious. The menu isn't huge but there's a good variety of different options, and ‚Ä¶"
75,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Italian pizza, nice space and good price. And the tiramisu was awesome too!"
76,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The pizza was absolutely amazing. We tried 2 different ones and even the one not meeting my taste I still considered way above average. The pizza is priced very well considering they mainly use D.O.P products. A small deduction since my company noted that the bathroom facilities were dirty.
77,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great  pizza! The tiramisu is delicious.
78,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The pizzas are quite delicious and come highly recommended. Great spot for lunch.
79,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Finally found a good pizza place close by! Love the decor, accessibility and prices of this joint. The staff is helpful and on my first visit I could even get a table without having a reservation. Please understand that this is uncommon, one should actually call for reservation beforehand, as in any place in Amsterdam."
80,Sotto Pizzeria, 2 stars ,a year ago,Do you see the sad minuscule slice of eggplant in the center of the pizza? This is the extra eggplant I paid 1.50 ‚Ç¨ for. After this letdown I highly suspect this isn‚Äôt the first time the employees of SOTTO have disappointed others with the size of their eggplant.
81,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice restaurant, the food is pretty good, with a relatively low price for Holland. The menu is mostly just pizzas. The food is nice, but when we ordered it came extremely quickly (10 minutes after sitting down at our table) this isn't ‚Ä¶"
82,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,2 years ago,Great pizza but I‚Äôve gotta give this place a poor rating based on hygiene. No soap at all in the sole restroom - staff said they had missed a delivery and that we should avoid touching our food if we were concerned about it. It‚Äôs bad enough ‚Ä¶
83,Sotto Pizzeria, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Had four cheese pizza. Taste of blue cheese was overpowering, it was the only thing i could taste. Tomato sauce and cheese ratio was so off, it felt I was eating a soup out of leater shoe as the base was chewy. At 10 pm the atmosphere was tense - everyone was very keen to get off on time and were already cleaning everything."
84,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Superb pizza, desserts and wine served by friendly and attentive staff"
85,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious pizzas and home made tiramisu, great atmosphere and super friendly staff."
86,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Not a huge pizza fan although this was a phenomenal experience.

Book ahead the place fills up at night we just managed to squeeze onto a big ‚Ä¶"
87,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Busy little local pizza joint. Antipasti was superb. Margarita pizza was just right, crisp crust lively sauce. Good enough you won‚Äôt let it sit long enough to get soggy."
88,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Tasty pizza with authentic ingredients.
89,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Would reccomend to anyone. Some of the best pizza I've ever had, in a lovely little joint with friendly staff and chilled music. Very reasonably priced, particularly given the area. 11/10 would go again."
90,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Total scam. Don't look at the pictures they posted.. with the stupid star-shape initiative, my almost 17‚Ç¨ pizza was literally 20x20cm and with very little space for anything on top of it. When I asked for explanations, I annoyed the waiter ‚Ä¶"
91,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Delicious Pizza, nice Lokation and friendly Stuff. Highly Recommend it üëç"
92,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,a year ago,Super friendly service. Delicious pizza. Short and effective wine list. Cosy atmosphere inside. It is a great address. I absolutely recommand.
93,Sotto Pizzeria, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Pizza burned and dry outside and soggy and mushed up on inside part. I just hated the acoustics of the place, I was overcharged for someone's pizza and the taste was nothing extraordinary let alone the eating experience being terrible. ‚Ä¶"
94,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best pizza in the city. Also huissalade is great and antipasta. Sometimes you have to wait for food, but all the rest is great. We are coming here quite frequently with friends and love that place."
95,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good Naples style pizza in a nice location and space.  Like most good neapolitan pizza, the flavor and consistency of the dough and crust has a 5 minute half-life once it leaves the wood fire oven, meaning you have 5 minutes to eat it ‚Ä¶"
96,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent pizza despite the standard Amsterdam service levels. They will get to you eventually, even if you are the only customer present, the staff clearly have better things to do then rush to get your order."
97,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent pizza, good chewy Neapolitan base, great staff, decent price.  If you don't want to or can't book to sit in, do yourself a favour and get a takeout at least."
98,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic authentic italian pizza: delicious dough and tomato sauce. Polite staff and cosy interior too. Open on Sunday all day long.
99,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing hidden gem in a very quiet corner in the city centre. Not many options in the menu, but you do not need anything more. Pizza is amazing, authentic Italian, and a delicious Panna Cotta too."
100,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Too expensive. Moreover pizzas are very small, if you are hungry you have to eat at least 2 pizzas. Maybe for a baby one is enough. Taste is normal.
For sure i wont buy a pizza from them anymore!"
101,Sotto Pizzeria, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Ordered 3 Porcini pizzas (16.50 euros each) and got very small star shaped ones (20cm by 20cm each) with very low amount of seasoning and no Porcini at all. Table in front of the toilet as well and drowsy waiter. Btw, update increased prices in your online menu."
102,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice authentic Italian pizza in the centre of Amsterdam! The pizza was crispy, the ingredients fresh with a good selection of pizza to choose from the menu. Highly recommended"
103,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Real Neapolitan pizza from the wood fired oven! Can't beat it. It's light and tasty. This particular Sotto location is close to Central Station and Nemo. Reserving is a good idea.

105,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best pizza and good selection of drinks!
106,Sotto Pizzeria, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The pizza with ricotta in the borders is really nice, also the focaccia. A little disorganized. Very bad coffee. Nice people, taking care of the guests."
107,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Traditional pizza oven delivering quality dishes with a nice atmosphere!
108,Sotto Pizzeria, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Pizza was just ok,not the original napoletana as the ingredients were very poor and the said mozzarella di bufala was definitely not the real deal,at least the tiramis√π was good."
109,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome! Delicious Italian pizza, very nice place, super kind service. Maybe not the cheapest, but it is for sure to try if you want a good pizza in Amsterdam."

117,Sotto Pizzeria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A great hole-in-the-wall place on a nice walk between the zoo or the Jewish quarter and the Maritime Museum or the central station. Delicious pizza and friendly staff.

126,Sotto Pizzeria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It was good but it does take a while. Crust was delicious and the cheese was also delightful. The marinara was going but lacked something.

137,Sotto Pizzeria, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Disappointing, if one expects a true Neapolitan pizza. Otherwise, better then other pizza joints. A good excuse to walk away from the touristic city centre."
138,Sotto Pizzeria, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The pizza with ricotta in the borders is really nice, also the focaccia. A little disorganized. Very bad coffee. Nice people, taking care of the guests."
