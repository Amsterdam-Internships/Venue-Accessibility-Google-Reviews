0,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,2 months ago,"Nice location but very understaffed place. The waiter is running around unable to help everyone because he is alone .... On a busy weekend day. The menu has changed too, into less protein and more carbs - so not for better."
1,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is rather average unfortunately. The location is great, and the staff is efficient and courteous, even if not overly friendly. We were served fast, but the food was not up to our expectations. The goat cheese salad was too sweet, and …"
2,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Place has a wonderful decor that set it apart from the rest of the places we tried on our trip. …
3,Amstelhoeck, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice modern restaurant. The food is also good. Not a must visit but if you are in the area of the Opera and you just had a nice walk into the flea market you can stop by for a beer and a sandwich. You will not regret that. Definitively recommended is the RAW burger sandwich which you can see in one of the pictures.
4,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice place, nice view, nice night's to meet there."
5,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Not the worst burger I’ve had but definitely not the best. Fries tasted and felt as though they were made an hour ago and were just sitting out. Service is quick and they have an efficient way of calling for service through flipping a …
6,Amstelhoeck, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I went there to watch two of the world cup games. The location was nice and comfortable. The beers are good and the price point was okay. We tried the fish and chips which is perfectly done. The only negative point is, the waiters are very slow to get the orders or hand over the receipt!"
7,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,4 months ago,"We just want a tea with a pastry nata. The tea came very quick , but the pastry never came. We have asked twice for it and we got neglected !! Wait for more than 40 mins . Service is very bad !!"
8,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,6 months ago,"I worked here on 10th September Friday.After a long shift from 11am till 8:30 Pm where i was overworked as the restarent was heavily understaffed. I was taking orders, cleaning, managing the bar and deleivering orders from the kitche. All …"
9,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,7 months ago,In my opinion is the worst service in town that I tried. One lady of the staff was incredible arrogant and rude with us. I also received a canteen full of dirt (not cleaned properly). The food is not so good and is expensive compared to …
10,Amstelhoeck, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice location on the river, away from the noise of the centre. Comfortable outside seating, good beer, table service from friendly staff. The view is fantastic too. €7 for Amstel Beer is a bit cheeky, but also quite standard in much of …"
11,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"A laid back place with a great view. However, be very much aware of municipal politicians trying to reintegrate in society on Friday afternoons. Avoid eyecontact at all times, you know how they like to talk more than others want to listen. …"
12,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food they served is fresh and delicious, we just stop for a burger and it was so juicy and fresh. The server was so helpful and grateful (no common in AMS) nice neat place and perfect location."
13,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Good place, really big terrace, nice view over the channels, in 8 min cycling from the central station. For chill after a day in Amsterdam, could be the perfect place to go."
14,Amstelhoeck, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Limited menu like in Fast food. Not very clean tables. Too crowded. Fits for quick bite and a glass of beer
15,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,6 months ago,I came here for my reservation and they denied it to me saying only Dutch people can sit in this cafe. How about you dont open it a tourist place then?
16,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place with beautiful view. Fast and polite service. But the served coffee looks really shabby and tastes not better!
17,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,9 months ago,Typical touristic bar with overpriced drinks.

19,Amstelhoeck, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food was very nice and the people very friendly and helpful. Don't worry if you don't speak Dutch.
20,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was good, but be prepared to wait for service. Great view and patio"
21,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,5 months ago,More than 20 minutes to get the bill. And the best is that the place is empty.
22,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great location, reasonable food price, nice food, but had rude staff on our visit"
23,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,6 months ago,Understaffed and very slow service. Nice location but not worth it.

25,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful location (right by the Opera & Ballet) and a beautiful view (if you grab a table on the patio), however the service was lacking. The food was decent, nothing special (at least what I ordered) and the service was mediocre- we were …"
26,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to drink with friends. Good service, tasty ale and beer, a lot of Dutch snacks, a lot of space. You  can easy pay separate from each other. Prices are middle for Amsterdam. I recommend this place for those who want to spend a good time in a big company."
27,Amstelhoeck, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Convenient location and good menu. However the staff were disorganised and got the order a bit wrong. Small beer selection. Wide spirits and cocktail selection, but clearly sponsored by a large distiller so don't expect to get decent quality off-brand mixers."
28,Amstelhoeck, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is okay. Not anything particularly unique or anything extraordinary. They have a neat system where you can flip a light to indicate “service requested”. Well, we flipped the light and 10 mins later no one had stopped by to bring water. …"
29,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,7 months ago,A good spot to enjoy the canal view. The service crew hospitality is stellar.
30,Amstelhoeck, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place to sit for a drink on the terrace as it is exactly on the canal. But food was not good. And if you are gluten intolerant your only option is tomato soup that tasted like a ready made one. If you are into fast food though you will enjoy this place.
31,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice location. Friendly personnel. Food doesn't appeal to me.
32,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We are visiting Amsterdam and have tried some great restaurants around town, but this one was certainly not near that. The service was extremely slow and unfriendly. We arrived and had to wait for more than 20 minutes and nobody came to …"
33,Amstelhoeck, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Been here twice on two separate visits to amsterdam. Placed in a lovely area right by the canal and round the corner from love lock bridge. Only eaten here on one of the visits and found a simple ham and cheese toastie very tasty but …
34,Amstelhoeck, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Staff were very friendly. Quite pricey but beautiful views
35,Amstelhoeck, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, expensive and really slow service. People were chasing after the waiter to pay their bills, and to put their orders in. Once we ordered the food came quickly, but our drinks took so long they actually arrived after our meals! It has some nice tables in the sun, but I won't return."
36,Amstelhoeck, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The location is gorgeous, the food however is pretty average and a bit on the pricey side. Have a drink here but eat somewhere with better food and better variety. Everything is sandwiches and for those of the group who are vegetarian, options are strictly limited."
37,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great view, classic beer!"
38,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The food was ok at best. But sadly everything else was awful. The service was fast, but sloppy. We had to remind them several time for certain orders. They wanted to charge €2.5 for a refill of warm water in the tea. They forgot about …"
39,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent service, friendly and helpful.  Food delicious, both the veggie burger and meat option with accompanying chips, as was the lager and rosé we had to drink. The apple pie in a pint is a must for dessert - but leave plenty of room!"
40,Amstelhoeck, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Came here as one of the closest restaurants to our hotel . Decent choice of beers and service while mixed was fairly good even when we had a party of 8 arrive just before us. Worth trying the Amsterdam veal croquettes. Amsterdam raw sausage ok.
41,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,6 months ago,Uncooperative staff and mismanagement all over the place. This is the last thing I expected here. Never coming back to this place.
42,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Food was exceptional. Loved location service was great
43,Amstelhoeck, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Friendly staff, but their organizational system appears absent. Nice terrace."
44,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,3 years ago,"had to wait 30 minutes until someone approached us, ordered 4 beers but got only 3,   had to ask 3 more times until the 4th beer was brought. There were a lot of pigeons eating from tables and pooing on them, we had pigeon poo on our table …"
45,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great location but horrible waiters! We were waiting outside to order the drinks and they were inside dancing and talking about how boring it was, well, they would be less bored if they could just do their job, which is to take the orders from the clients and serve the drinks, meals,....."
46,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Had dinner there as part of a group of more than 100 people, so it was a set menu. The whole flatfish I had was delicious! Warm atmosphere for dinner, which turned into a bit of a dance floor with a DJ after."
47,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Friendly service and big screen to watch sports.
48,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,3 years ago,The waiter totally and conciently ignored us even if there were few customers. We waited more than 20 minutes before finally deciding to go to the restaurant next door. We definitely do not recommend this place.
49,Amstelhoeck, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Very nice atmosphere
but not the best service"
50,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worst service in town. We were there on a Saturday evening. Should have been warned by the mere absence of guests, but who would have known? There were at least 4 waiters and maybe 20-30 guests on the (big and beautiful situated) terrace …"
51,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Enjoyable food but nothing special; very small and overpriced portions. Extremely rude and unhelpful staff, slow and inneficient service, ignored by waitress several times, drinks came after food despite being ordered first, claimed we ordered more drinks than we actually had, didn't take away plates or come to offer the bill."
52,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The location is great. The food was pretty good. The service was so slow, had three wait staff and it took forever to close out, also forgot one pf our beverages."
53,Amstelhoeck, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place. Courteous and friendly staff. Would recommend it.
54,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food was OK. Typical pub fare. Waiter was not attentive and almost not present. Kitchen staff did a good job of delivering food quickly once ordered.
55,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had the veggie pasta, really good.
The gin and tonic was gigantic which threw me ... like a beer mug... but after 17,000 steps it went down smooth. Reasonable price"
56,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible service. Waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged, and waited another 20 for our bill to come. We asked for it at the same time we ordered, the server just never came back. Wouldn’t recommend."
57,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,a year ago,We took wine and they tried to charge us two times . In the end they charged us the right amount. Do not reccomended at all... u can see the pic which is a proof below

59,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,2 years ago,Sorry but the service was very bad and waiters unfriendly. We where a few couples bought food and drinks for more then EUR 300. Food came after between 20 - 60 minutes. At the end we could not pay separate and had to go through the menu to …
60,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,a year ago,The drinks are a scam. We had to order an extra shot of bacardi to add to our mojito as it was just ice and lime juice.
61,Amstelhoeck, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I had a quick stop to have a coffee, nice place, fast services"
62,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for grabbing few pints if beer or eat some food while you roaming around in central amsterdam. …

74,Amstelhoeck, 1 star ,7 years ago,Two person lunch is not enough to get a glass of tap water. Bad touristic food and horrible service. One of the worst in my 6 years in Amsterdam. Save yourself the trouble go somewhere else
75,Amstelhoeck, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was great, but one of the waitresses was so rude when I wanted to pay with a bigger bill (100eu :DD) and she saw that as a problem to change it .. That's ridiculous"

79,Amstelhoeck, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"I would recommend this restauration only because of food. It's absolutely delicious but, on the other side, it's too overpriced and the staff is doing their best but we spent about 1,5 hour with small lunch."
