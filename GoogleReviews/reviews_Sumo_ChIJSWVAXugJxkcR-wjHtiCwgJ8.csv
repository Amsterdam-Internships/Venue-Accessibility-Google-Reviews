1,Sumo, 2 stars ,a month ago,"My friend and I sadly had a very bad experience at this restaurant yesterday. We‚Äôve been to Sumo Sushi many times now, but this was by far the worst, I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I‚Äôm saying the food is normally three times better than what we ‚Ä¶"
2,Sumo, 3 stars ,a month ago,Good atmosphere and really fast but friendly staff. The sushi is fresh tasting and the grilled items on the menu are also a must try. My only issue was that the portion sizes/quantity of food on the all you can eat menu is nowhere near as ‚Ä¶
3,Sumo, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Nice interior. But busy on the weekends, orders take some time (especially sushi). 90 minutes go by fast, so you have to plan your ordering; this can be a little stressful. But overall a good experience."
4,Sumo, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Great venue, great service. Was really a nice spot to have a meal with some cool robots delivering food. I had to deduct points as it was very expensive (you get 5 courses of 4 dishes, which is too much) and you have to pay 35 euro no ‚Ä¶"
5,Sumo, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,"We used to like going there but this time most food was bad. They also never brought a lot of items. 20 min wait for the table. We had to ask 3 times and wait 30 minutes for a bottle of water.15 minutes wait for the bill, another 10 for the ‚Ä¶"

Today I have @sumo for you guys!!
This is a Japanese restaurantüáØüáµ. they have sushi and much and much more...... ‚Ä¶"
7,Sumo, 1 star ,8 months ago,"The fishes aren't fresh at all, the side dishes are microwaved. Very bad experience. The only good thing about this restaurant was the service. The food sucks!!! One small bottle of water cost 3.65 euros.  Will never go back again."
8,Sumo, 2 stars ,a year ago,Stopped by for lunch mid week after the movies and was pretty disappointed. We were one of the few people in the restaurant and we still had issues being served. The 2 servers were also making and eating some of their own food not in demo ‚Ä¶
9,Sumo, 1 star ,a month ago,"Really disappointed with the service and the staff that was super rude.
All our food has arrived late, some orders didn‚Äôt arrive and some orders got mixed up with other tables.
Do not recommend at all."
10,Sumo, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Pleasant and helpful staff. Food of varying quality. The deep-fried shrimp and chicken were excellent, the grilled salmon was dry as dust, and there was far too much ginger in the poke bowl. But they did come up with a very good gluten-free sushi and maki dish."
11,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very fancy looking restaurant. We had such a load of food and the variety was amazing. The salads, sushis, grilled fish and the other stuffs were all great. The environment is quite relaxed and they were ready to accommodate us without ‚Ä¶"
12,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was much better than we expected.

The place itself, interior, was beautifully done, can't knock it. ‚Ä¶"
13,Sumo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice environment and helpful personnel! The 6rounds menu option is a real value-for-money option and there's no way you'll leave this place with an empty stomach! The salmon mango sushi was incredible!
14,Sumo, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"The atmosphere and the food are really nice. The service was a bit slow and we were really upset by the fact that the waiter did not explained to us how the ""all you can eat"" works in detail. ‚Ä¶"
15,Sumo, 1 star ,5 months ago,This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. They reduced the order size from 5 per round to 4 per round. Service was slow. We missed at least 2 dishes per round. When asked (and we had to multiple times) literally nothing was done about ‚Ä¶

17,Sumo, 1 star ,4 months ago,If I could give it less than 0 stars I would. Probably the rudest staff I have ever encountered. It took an hour for them to bring one single bottle of water. When we asked for missed orders they just rudely walked away. And this is not ‚Ä¶
18,Sumo, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"The food was nice and the restaurant looks very nice. It's clean and the food is served quite fast. Staff is there basically to serve out food, but not to enhance your lunch or dinner."
19,Sumo, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Worst all you can eat sushi experience I have had so far. The service was really bad, ordered multiple times but the food didn't come. Or it would come half an hour later double... 0,5L of beer was ‚Ç¨8! And we had to ask twice for drinks, ‚Ä¶"
20,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great sushi, and glutenfree uppon request. Very friendly service!
Lovely location, and handily next door to the cinema. Also easy for public transport and taxis. ‚Ä¶"
21,Sumo, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Poor dinner, awful service. Seafood was low quality , they even offer crab and give you surimi. The waitress had no idea of the difference.
You order through a tablet which is very impersonal and metered - they measure ‚Ä¶"
22,Sumo, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"The menu plan could be clearer, you use a tablet to order food (specifically all you can eat) and its kinda hard to keep track of what you've ordered, you've got 90 minutes to order dishes 5 times in 10-15 minutes intervals. ‚Ä¶"
23,Sumo, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"The quality of the good is reasonably ok for an ""all you can eat"". While the sushi rice is mediocre, the other ingredients are very good. ‚Ä¶"
24,Sumo, 1 star ,4 months ago,"I was here on a Saturday. After the time frame we still had sushis pending. But it never came. We had to go to the cinema afterwards, so we missed many rounds of sushi. The deep fried stuff did came fast, but 4 of the 5 ordered mainly sushi that barely came"
25,Sumo, 2 stars ,7 months ago,At least one dish was missing in each round. We had to wait for the last round for half an hour... and we didn't wait. The waitresses ignored our requests to bring this sad banana for dessert
26,Sumo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had both types of dishes here. Meals and sushi. I thought the sushi was nice. Good creations well presented with a nice mix of flavours. However the meals were sub par in my opinion. ‚Ä¶
27,Sumo, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"I think it's gotten a bit worse over the last few years. It's not really ""all you can eat"" when there is a maximum of 20 dishes to order. For example, if you order 20 nigiri, you might not get very full as they come in single servings. This ‚Ä¶"

29,Sumo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,First this one of the most beautiful restaurants I have ever seen. Really you go in and just wow (you can see in my attached pictures) the food was super tasty I had a sushi and also chicken noodles all was superb fresh and tasty. Waiters are kind good English speaking and just a wonderful experience
30,Sumo, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,It is my worst dinner experience ever. I hope i can order some dessert at least :(( i ruined my and my friend's Saturday evening
31,Sumo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Sumo is an Asian ‚Äúall you can eat‚Äù chain. This branch is close to Leidseplein and huge with a very nice interior. You have a good chance to still find a table on the weekends without having a booking. ‚Ä¶
32,Sumo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Sumo is a safe go to place for sushi, no doubt. They were very nice with us as we bumped in 10 to 10, and let us order food, and did let us take our time, so we did not feel rushed. Always very good waitresses here, but sometimes they are ‚Ä¶"
33,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This restaurant has an all you can eat option. That was what I opted for. And it was simply amazing. The service was fast and friendly. Also the sushi was all so fresh and very delicious. I would recommend this restaurant anytime.
34,Sumo, 1 star ,5 months ago,"We have been 2 years ago and was nice.Thus time the reduce the rounds for 5x5 to 4x5 and more expensive,the first 2 rounds was perfect the 3 and 4 was cold and one plate of the 3 came in 4 and 25 minutes later.We never go again.Thw manager was very helpful but the waiters not. The Mojo,Mito or Tempura are better choices."
35,Sumo, 1 star ,5 months ago,Did the all you can eat thing. Sat down at 18:00. Things took forever to arrive and what shouldve been a relatively quick in and out turned into a 2.5 hour ordeal. Food wasn‚Äôt bad but unfortunately never coming back again.
36,Sumo, 2 stars ,4 months ago,The staff was not nice and service was terrible. We did not receive dishes for too long after we order and then everything came mixed. Tho food tasted delicious tho
37,Sumo, 3 stars ,a week ago,"Good service, tasty food, quite a lot of vegan options.
I did find it pricey."
38,Sumo, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Since last time i was here the place has changed. Less rounds, lesser portions. Non existing service. You need to wait for single dish 20min. Or 20 for a tablet
Wouldn't come back"
39,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good quality. All you can eat formula not properly all but 5 rounds of 5 dish each, more than enough to be full and satisfied."
40,Sumo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food. It is fixed price and you can order many dishes. The place is huge. The service is great!
41,Sumo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very authentic all-you-can-eat restaurant. The food was in general really good. The sushi is ok, but average in my opinion. However, the variety of the food is great, and it's also very tasty. So if you're looking for delicious sushi I ‚Ä¶"
42,Sumo, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"We eat the all you can eat menu. This is limited to maximal 5 rounds with maximal 20 foods. So maximal 100 foods. Sounds big, but if you're to five, like us, then you have maximal 20 foods, you can order. The sushi was okay, but not really fresh and good. For me the last time, i eat there sushi."
43,Sumo, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Arrived at 12:30 and waited an hour for the order. the soup was brought cold. the waiters talked loudly among themselves, not respecting the guests."
44,Sumo, 1 star ,6 months ago,Interior looks nice but that's it. Expensive and horrible service. Asked 3 times to bring the bottle of water we ordered. Never came. Also brought wrong orders.
45,Sumo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Worth with a visit for the all-you-can-eat dining experience alone. The ambience and decor feels very authentic and reminded me of large dim sum restaurants in China and Hong Kong. ‚Ä¶
46,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice sushi place in Amsterdam, good setup and decoration, and service is also very good, absolutely love it and enjoy it every time I visit."
47,Sumo, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Always delicious. Love the interior. Staff didn't ask us what we wanted to drink an we where mostly ignored. It wasn't a busy midday so there weren't a lot of costumers. The people that where there, they bunched up together next to each other to make it easier for themselves to serve. Felt awkward."
48,Sumo, 1 star ,7 months ago,"I've never had such a bad experience in a restaurant. Food was mediocre!! .. Service was awful.. We asked 6 times one beer and nobody took care of it, every time our drinks were finished we call somebody to order and they looked like ‚Ä¶"
49,Sumo, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Plenty of delicious food can be had here. Unlike other Sumo restaurants however, you're limited by the number of services you can order. So, this isn't really an ""all you can eat"" restaurant."
50,Sumo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"‚Ç¨28 per person for dinner! You get unlimited rounds but can only order 5 dishes each round, and have to pay for any waste so don't go ordering something you know you don't like. ‚Ä¶"
51,Sumo, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Unfortunately post covid Sumo has much less quality and they save on fish or else increasing the cheap component of the dish (salad, rice, cucumber).. A pity, especially when they think people would not notice. Also less orders included (4 items in 5 orders). Before covid it was a 5"
52,Sumo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very good food and worth the price. I ate more than I should have but very much worth it.
Only one disappointment (not worth taking away a star though) is the dessert, not very good and bland. But the rest is succulent!"

56,Sumo, 1 star ,8 months ago,"STAY AWAY. After a long lockdown spent inside our house, we really looked forward to our dinner at Sumo. We expected the usual but oh how we are extremely disappointed. Wished we have read the reviews before going there. We should have gone ‚Ä¶"

59,Sumo, 1 star ,7 months ago,"If You want it or not you have to buy at least one drink each Person ( the drinks, by the way,  are too expensive, for 0,5 l of water Is 3.65‚Ç¨), they were very disrespectful because one of them took our menu/tablet from our hands to check ‚Ä¶"
60,Sumo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great formula! You order each ""round"" (course to us Brits) as you go by handing the waitress a card with your ticket selections. Food was lovely and nice oriental themed ambience."
61,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere, delicious food. Great services. Well recommended"
62,Sumo, 1 star ,5 months ago,The service was really bad and the quality of the sushi as well. Definitely can not recommend the restaurant at all.
63,Sumo, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"The food is really delicious, but the price is much more expensive now, but you are allowed to order less than some time ago, makes no sense to me! Not a smart move.
Lost 1 star!!!"
64,Sumo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Sushi is good for that price and seemed to be fresh but service is very bad, Ive found a long hair in my sushi, waiter told me Ill talk to che chef, then nothing happened, not even an apologize from the manager, such a shame... plus I asked ‚Ä¶"
65,Sumo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Excellent food, and a good experience with friends. A bit pricey, so not the everyday dining experience, but worth it."

73,Sumo, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"In general, the customer service experience was not very nice. They didn't allow us to split the bill without informing us upfront."
74,Sumo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great quality and atmosphere. All you can eat is a lot cheaper between 12h-17h.
75,Sumo, 1 star ,7 months ago,NOT a true all you can eat sushi. Max order is 5 rounds. 4 pcs per round. AND YOU HVAE TO WAIT 10 min between each order. Don‚Äôt go here.
76,Sumo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, all you can eat place, which is not easy to find in Amsterdam, however did not appreciate that the lunch times are different to the ones publicized at the door."
77,Sumo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I visited on Valentine's Day with my fiance. It was busy but seemed organized. We ordered our first round with the tablet, and after waiting 20+ minutes, nothing came. So we ordered another round, and slowly started receiving items (and ‚Ä¶"

80,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Our favourite sushi restaurant in the town. Food is delicious, staff is kind and prompt. We bring all of our guests here without an exception. The atmosphere is very nicely decorated with cherry blossoms. A big plus is that it's a kid friendly restaurant."
81,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Highlight of our trip to Amsterdam! The fish is so fresh and the food is cooked to perfection. The gyoza was steamed, as opposed to fried, so were wonderfully soft. The way of ordering is very interesting, and it's a good way to track what ‚Ä¶"
82,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Good food friendly stuff, nice atmosphere and place"
83,Sumo, 1 star ,6 months ago,"This is the worst buffet sushi in Amsterdam, there are simply better alternatives like Mojo and  Shiso."
84,Sumo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Two suggestions: serve tap water (instead of charging 7‚Ç¨ per bottle). And be more upfront about requiring a drink per person for the all you can eat menu‚Äîwe were only told after we‚Äôd placed our first order, which felt a bit scammy. Otherwise pretty good food and decent service. And the place is decorated like a James Bond set!"
85,Sumo, 1 star ,2 years ago,Highly disappointing experience on Valentine‚Äôs Day night at Sumo. After looking forward to our reservation all week and arriving on time we had to wait 15 minutes at the entrance together with about 20 others who had also reserved as the ‚Ä¶

You get 5 rounds with 5 dishes per person, after 3 rounds we were already full ‚Ä¶"
92,Sumo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Kitchy decor, but I kinda like it like that. Food is okay to good, and it arrives either pretty fast or not at all... Ordering by tablet is great and should become the standard everywhere. Service is friendly but chaotic, they seem swamped ‚Ä¶"
93,Sumo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,I visited this place on the weekend with my girlfriend. We made a reservation through the phone yet when we showed up there was no staff to greet us and we had to wait with everyone else that did not make a reservation for over 10 minutes ‚Ä¶

For less than ‚Ç¨30 you can sushi-binge for two hours! Very good food and quick service.
Eat responsibly :)"
97,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amsterdam is an incredible place for raw fish and this place is excellent. What you need to know: you have two hours and five orders where you can order five pieces. If you don't finish something you will be charged. Good luck! You may eat so much sushi that you won't want sushi for a long time.
98,Sumo, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Sushi was good but the service was poor.
99,Sumo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Unfortunately, we ordered the all you could eat and after 40 minutes we barely had any of our second flight. We told them we had a movie showing at that time but were indifferent. After asking for the bill multiple times, we had to finally just go to the bar and pay. Definitely avoid this place if you don't have hours to eat."

111,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A bit on the expensive side, but the interior is quite good. I think this restaurant should be viewed more as an experience than as a quick all you can eat bite. Staff is friendly and food is very qualitative"
112,Sumo, 1 star ,2 years ago,Had a lunch menu in 20 Euro each. U get 5 dishes from the menu . All dishes were very very small and not so good. When we came out we went to eat a burger cause we were still hungry . Restaurant is beautiful but food is very medium.

131,Sumo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Awesome food, clean, taste good, huge variety. I love it. some of the waiters  can be nicer and give better service, still deserves 5 starts."
132,Sumo, 3 stars ,a year ago,"During Corona times not the best place to go. Feels a bit rushed in 1,5 hour. But the sushi was very fresh this time. This also seems to differ every time a little."
133,Sumo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Good ambiance but poor quality dishes and services. We tried the eat all you can dinner. Sashimis unfortunately are not included.  The makis look and taste unfresh/soggy. The grilled/fried dishes like beef pepper, pork and chicken do not ‚Ä¶"
134,Sumo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I love to come to Sumo. The quality of the food is great (for an all-you-can-eat restaurant). The service is usually quick and the location is very central. There is a lot of space and I never needed a reservation (for 2 persons). I highly recommend this place if you love Japanese food and want to have a nice/relaxed evening.
135,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a regular go to spot for my mommy friends and kids. Kids under 4 eat free. Yay! Lunch is 20euro pp for an all you can eat formula. But you order from a menu and they cook it to order. Surprisingly, sushi is not their mainstay. Half ‚Ä¶"
136,Sumo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Quality is good but the 1 star is just for the service. Lazy, moody and overpopulated service where you need to ask if they can pickup the plates or the order list. Unbelievable... No communication, no smiles, no enthusiasm, I'm depressed now."
137,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favourite sushi restaurant in Amsterdam, it has a buffet for around 30‚Ç¨ where they bring you a tablet with the menu , and you order from there and they bring to the table, really good and interesting menu, with a lot of options, the ‚Ä¶"
138,Sumo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,It's not your highest quality sushi. It's a well maintained and cool restaurant and has all you can eat.. which is usually a good sign of ok sushi.. so if that is your thing and you like Chinese food you'll love this place. ‚Ä¶
139,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love it! All you can eat cooked to order food for a very good price. I don't eat fish or shellfish but there is a lot of other great food items on the menu! Remember to book a table
140,Sumo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Good food and nice staff just the wait times between courses are far too long. I was in there for almost two hours and never even got my last order of sushi. They need to get a bigger kitchen or remove some tables.
141,Sumo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"At first I was a bit skeptical about the restaurant, but apparently I was WRONG. The restaurant is well decorated and the service is super fast. The dishes were incredibly tasty and fresh. The price is great for what you get!"
142,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great restaurant, all you can eat style. The one in Leidsplein has a big hall on ground floor and an upper floor with plenty of space. The food was very nice as well, definitely recommend it!"
143,Sumo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A very nice location and great food. Though the price is not the best (it‚Äôs quite expensive seeing how much food you‚Äôll eat in the end). I must say that I do prefer Sumo above one of the other all-you-can-eat restaurants around. The staff ‚Ä¶
144,Sumo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Tasty sushi for the normal sushi eater. Probably not very authentic and service is so-so. Lunch is recommended over dinner. You'll save a few bucks and it's pretty much the same menu.
145,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This restaurant was so nice and the food was amazing! I love the option that you can choose all you can eat and can use the iPad. I wish I saw more of these restaurants back in the states in Florida. Loved it!
146,Sumo, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Funny experience. Price was too expensive, anyway. We payed about 35 for a ""all you can eat"" menu. Sushi was great and the local was awesome, but price made it a little bit disapointing. anyway if you dont mind paying some extra price for sushi that place is great."
147,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Ambience is great and food is good! Worth every penny for all you can eat. Highly recommended if you like a lot of variety of food.
148,Sumo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The sushi was very tasty. Unlike other all-you-can-eat restaurants they use a good amount of fish and not that much rice. Also the sushi is freshly made.
149,Sumo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We had to wait for more than 30 minutes for our food. We got food from other tables, and don't know if they served everything we ordered. Pretty disappoiting experience."
150,Sumo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The quality of servicing in this branch of Sumo is very low compare to others. After 10 mins arriving and trying to be seen by own the waitress, nobody approached us while they were gathered in one corner and talking and laughing."
151,Sumo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good service, good food. Went for lunch all you can eat, decent price. A big bottle of water is on the expensive side."
152,Sumo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good all you can eat with 6 rounds instead of the usual 5 in Amsterdam. Servers are friendly and fast. Recommended for in the centre of Amsterdam
153,Sumo, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great place - fair quality for the sushi and the interior is very nice, lovely wines. Is my go to place for sushi in the area üç£  üç∑"
154,Sumo, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"This restaurant is the perfect place for Japanese cuisine lovers.

For EUR 28, you can order as many dishes as you like. You have a large menu ‚Ä¶"
155,Sumo, 1 star ,4 years ago,Long wait between orders.  They also lost our order card and forgot about it. The waitress offered to process 2 orders simultaneously but it was already 40 minutes into the service. Usually they are faster but this was a really bad day :(
156,Sumo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice ambiance, sushi varies in quality. Had some very outstanding pieces other all-you-can-eat don't have (or lesser quality) and some pieces that lack taste."
157,Sumo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The place seems nice but soon as we asked for an explanation for the all you can eat menu and had a few questions the waiter had a really bad attitude. Didn‚Äôt even set down to eat, we just left the restaurant a group of 10 people"
158,Sumo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"For an ""All you can eat"" restaurant, it was pretty good! Food was of pretty high quality and so was the service! Would definitely recommend, presuming you know that you'll eat a good amount of food -- Otherwise there are probably cheaper places to eat."
159,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice and good Japanese food service on a ""all you can eat"" formula. Worth to visit. Quality price is good. Very nice and exclusive interior. Recommended"
160,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,All you can eat sushi with great service. I think it would be nice if you had at least one portion of sashimi included in your all you can eat combo and then charge for extra ones if ordered.
161,Sumo, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Tasty high quality sushi and friendly staff!
162,Sumo, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice sushi, not bad or especially good. Graat location though and a terrace for outside dining in the summer and having a good view of all the people passing by. Unless you eat a lot I would recommend ordering a la carte it will probably be cheaper"
163,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best sushi deal you can have in Holland! Great appetisers inclusive in the all you can eat menu, some ice cream and dessert also, The branch in Leidseplein has the nicest decor and ambience."
164,Sumo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,We had a lovely moment in this beautiful place :)
165,Sumo, 2 stars ,10 years ago,"Busy tourist trap.slow service,but friendly.we walked in not realising the cost was 25.50 euros pp not including drinks. so we asked for the a la carte menu which was met with confusion for the waiter to understand.we had a little selection ‚Ä¶"
166,Sumo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was very good and the staff seemed friendly but... they didn't talk much at all or make any eye contact, it felt like they were robotic almost, that being said it was good and quick sevice."
167,Sumo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was fast and friendly, but the food soggy and with too much mayonnaise. I used to go often and wanted to try again, but won't go anymore."
168,Sumo, 1 star ,7 years ago,"Upon entering the restaurant, my olive complexion was greeted in the most racist way possible. The man said upon taking a quick glance upon my darker skin: ""go home...  Sleep,"" as though me being different from him is just reason for me to ‚Ä¶"
169,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It‚Äôs an amazing Japanese restaurant and I guess you already know, all sushi fans out there, this is a place you want to eat at least once o your sushi journey. I assure you that you won‚Äôt regret it."
170,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Simply one of the best place to go in Amsterdam. It‚Äôs beautiful inside, the prices are modest for Amsterdam and its really tasty.
You can have a la carte menu."
171,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It's a bargain and the food is awesome. Staff helps you a lot even if you're a novice at sushi. Recommended. Toilets are tidy.
172,Sumo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I've been here for an hour and they've forgotten about me, filled with beer now. All you can drink at a price!!"
173,Sumo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"It's always been average, but good enough for an all you can eat. But the quality of the sushi seems to be going down lately."
174,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent quality food! And I love the ‚Äúall you can eat‚Äù formula. Love it! also, the decor is really beautiful"
175,Sumo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Quick tasty and you order off a tablet which makes it so much easier
176,Sumo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"3 times when I was here, my friends did not feel good (was poisoned by unfresh food). They have to be more careful with seafood, it spoils too quick)."
177,Sumo, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Amazingly tasteful food, terrible staff.... Fortunately, at the end we came across a waiter with a smile"
178,Sumo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Gorgeous environment, excellent food and despite the fact of order process, everything came very fast to table. Waitress were very regardful."
179,Sumo, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Even though we spent a good portion of our meal trying to get the waitresses' attention for more water, I would go back. Cheap and tasty. :)"
180,Sumo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Yeah it depends on what your taste for sushi is like, they serve it pre-made and without too much jazz. Good for larger groups I guess."
181,Sumo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great place. You can choose between A la carte (you pay for what you take) or all you can eat (around 30‚Ç¨). Delicious and nice atmosphere.
182,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"All you can eat for 20‚Ç¨ only. Amazingly high fish quality as well. Only minus: very expensive drinks, which aren't included"
183,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Beautiful restaurant. Fast service. Delicious food.
184,Sumo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very good restaurant. The taste of the food is amazing. The interior design is one of the most beautiful things that gives you a very good feeling for the soul.
185,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great taste and a lot of varriaties for a reasonable price
186,Sumo, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The decor is absolutely beautiful with cherry trees and the colour scheme. The food was really good and there is a bit of a wait for your food but over all very good.
187,Sumo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good price for the food! Fresh, a great option for a all you can eat sushi place"
188,Sumo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Usually good sushi and other dishes. Love the location and friendly workers. They are a little on the slow side when there are a lot of people.
189,Sumo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice food and pretty decor. Sadly the last time I went they had us waiting for 20min until they took our order.
190,Sumo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This place are to many rules, it is not all you can eat and each person is obliged to order some drink even though I do not want.
I have never seen this in any of the countries I have ever visited. I don't  recommend this place never ."
191,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Delicious sushi place in the city
192,Sumo, 1 star ,3 years ago,All you can eat at it's worst. Sushi needs to be fresh made. But then again they also have chicken in rice which they call sushi...
193,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Exclusive and elegant place with excellent food!
Everybody should visit this restaurant at Leidseplein who wants to be amazed by decorative restaurant and great flavours of sushi, duck, chicken, pork, beef and so on .. !!!"

199,Sumo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good quality food and wide range of choices. The service was great but they were slow in bringing the food
200,Sumo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Beautiful setting and large menu
201,Sumo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,If you have guests outside of NL it would be wise to go somewhere else. Foods are not that bad but the service was too slow.
202,Sumo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I found it nice to dine here yet cannot say the same for food, figured that shusi is not my favorite. Service could be better, little bit faster."
203,Sumo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Ran into some tech issues with the ipad menu system but we received prompt service and the food we were served was well-prepared and very tasty!
204,Sumo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food was good. Service was slow and rarely saw our server to refill drinks and order more.
205,Sumo, 2 stars ,9 years ago,Arrogant staff... half full restaurant eager to chase away customers before closing time. I came for the all you can eat  menu... told it was over had to eat a la carte???? Was hungry so did so. 10pm on the dot the entire kitchen staff sat down right in front of me with tons of food... hmmi guess they dont need customers

210,Sumo, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"A fine restaurant to visit if you like sushi but don't like to spend to much money. The sushi lacks taste, but is fine for people that Just started eating sushi."
211,Sumo, 1 star ,2 years ago,Not the best Sumo in Amsterdam! Painfully slow staff who look miserable. Service is very poor and food cold. Go to Vijzelstraat instead.
212,Sumo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Grill is good but sushi? Can I eat it or just receive one teaser after the other?
Ordering subject to limitations."
