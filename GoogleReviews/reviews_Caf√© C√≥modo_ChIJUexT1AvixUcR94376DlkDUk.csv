0,Caf√© C√≥modo, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"I loved the idea of the filled ""paprika"". And the execution looked amazing as you can see on the picture. The sauces were also great. However the filling was wet quinoa which was not great at all. Great service and a lots of different beers to choose from."
1,Caf√© C√≥modo, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Lovely food! The menu is full of unsurprising crowd pleasers, but they turned out to be really delicious. A great burger with a thick medium rare patty, buttered brioche-like bread, yellow america cheese (pure nostalgia) and great …"
2,Caf√© C√≥modo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice place (really new) in West. The staff is super friendly and the small platters are definitely worth trying. The interior is very nice and the colours even better. Definitely a recommendation!
3,Caf√© C√≥modo, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Food was really bad.
Menu is not very south american and the taste of the sandwich I had was horrible. Sandwich was also soaked.
Drinks are okayish but quite pricy."
4,Caf√© C√≥modo, 5 stars ,a month ago,One of the best music selections in town! Great place!
5,Caf√© C√≥modo, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Good spot for borrel. Tasty beers and food. Would recommend.
6,Caf√© C√≥modo, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"The nachos I ordered here were quite disappointing, lukewarm and hardly any toppings. Youd expect there to at least be chichen or another type of meat. Way too expensive for the meal i was given."
7,Caf√© C√≥modo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely accommodating staff. We had great snacks here with great beer and wine.
8,Caf√© C√≥modo, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Good spot, plenty of seats outside and not too busy"
9,Caf√© C√≥modo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"My friends and I had a good time here, with good drinks and good food. We all ordered appetizers or snacks and shared. The spicy shrimp was especially good. It wasn't too busy when we went there but it still took a long time to get a menu and a longer time to get the bill, but the staff were very friendly."
10,Caf√© C√≥modo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely  bar on the canalside Amsterdam, we had a few drinks and nachos, good atmosphere"
11,Caf√© C√≥modo, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Terrible atmosphere, terrible service, extremely bad food … the only thing that works for this place is that its in Amsterdam. Vomited all the food as soon as i got home …. Truly terrible. Wouldn’t recommend to my worst enemy"
12,Caf√© C√≥modo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cozy place, plenty of tables, pleasant, fast service and good quality for money! Nachos were awesome, could have more guacamole, but let’s be honest it’s never enough... Confused with all of those 4 star reviews with nothing negative to say, this is a 5 for sure :)"
13,Caf√© C√≥modo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great spot for a drink in Oud West with nice outside tables. Young and cool crowd with good service. Food can be a little ""hit or miss"". But the chicken is excellent and so is Taco Tuesday!"
14,Caf√© C√≥modo, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Nice food (the Huevos rancheros are FODMAP compatible), good service. A pity though they serve San Pellegrino, a Nestlé company."
15,Caf√© C√≥modo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, friendly service and good menu. We ordered few starters and mains, all were good but steak was excellent. Portions are also quite generous and they have good cocktails too."
16,Caf√© C√≥modo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Service has never once been competent here... they're either super busy and understaffed or not busy with apathetic service where you wonder if you are actively being ignored. Snacks are a nice size for sharing (nachos, popcorn). Wines are nothing to get excited about :/"
17,Caf√© C√≥modo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good beer, creative starters and fantastic bavette steak. Spanish red wine was really good for the price too. Distressed decor made it a fun place to be."

22,Caf√© C√≥modo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful atmosphere and lovely staff really make this a great addition to the many restaurants in Oud-West. However, I did feel that the menu could use a little work. The pre-dinner snacks are a little flimsy (add some bread please!), the …"
