1,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible food and bad customer service. Avoid at all cost.
Food was extremely salty which was not edible for me. I barely touched my hutspot (traditional beef meatballs) at 17 euro a dish and it made me so thirsty, I …"
2,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had lunch here and absolutely loved it!!! The food was great! The staff was nice! Wide variety of food, lots of choices. Had an amazing pizza and a bacon and cheese pancake! Heavenly. Highly recommended and will definitely go back! :)"
3,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice place with amazing decoration. I really didn't like the fact that they only accept credit cards. They required only cash. Also, the waitress was a bit rude and unhappy."
4,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Great neighborhood cafe restaurant. Good selection of genuine Dutch breakfast and lunch traditional food a short walk from Anne Frank museum
5,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely Restaurant, the price is a bit expensive compared to other restaurants but the food is nice. I love pork ribs here, so tender and tasty."

8,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,2 years ago,"- Wouldn’t bother visiting again
- Food is very basic and not very nice
- Toilets were dirty …"
9,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Cosy café, nice staff, good food, prices okay. The only thing I have to complain is the bunch of waste the guests have to create. Jam, butter, honey, all is packed in this small mini containers you know from some hotels. That's not the contemporary way to protect the environment."
10,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I love this place! This is a great option when you are in the area and is not a tourist trap. I have been here 4 or 5 times and always had a pleasant experience. A few tips: be patient, do not make substitutions, and be friendly. The …"
11,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We had the special which was Ribs and they were very nice and I had a cheese burger which was okay. …
12,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Got an Irish Coffee which was delicious. Stopped here before we visited the Anne Frank house for a bite to eat and a drink. We ordered fries and a margarita pizza- food was just ok. Cute vibe.
13,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Tomato soup was great, servous not as good.. but decent prices for the area. All of the group I was with liked their food. Recommend tomato soup, the toasties, the lasagne and the ribs! Coffee was good too."
14,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had a great time here with my friends and I really liked the breakfast food options they had. Highly recommend!
15,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"-Friendly waitress

16,De Oude Wester, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I do not recommend!

Service was of low quality. The Polish waiter said I cannot use the toilet …"
17,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Pancake was tasteless. The restaurant ambiance and service was good.
18,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Overpriced, overcooked, my pancake was black. Would not visit any other time. One of the worst place."
19,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent place with good service and friendly staff.  Unfortunately we tried the Dutch pancakes which were just ok.  Nothin special.  I should have taken our bike guide’s recommendation and ordered something else.  However, people talked …"
20,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I've been here a couple of times and it was exactly what I needed.  The first was during the day at the height of summer.  Was able to sit outside and people watch with a cold beer in hand.  The second time was late evening in the fall …
21,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Quaint Dutch cafe. The decor is nice. The pancakes are tasty. The staff were not particularly chatty but were polite. The toilets could be better maintained. There was no toilet paper and are located next to the kitchen
22,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very bad attitude.  Me and my friend came in and wanted to have one pancake with 2 drinks, and the server (only 1 lady was in charge of the whole restaurant) was annoyed she couldn’t get us to order more. Then, another couple decided to …"
23,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really good pancakes and super service. Wait staff was very friendly and prompt. Cozy little place on the corner of a canal, not far from the Anne Frank House.
Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a good breakfast, or even just …"
24,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Place was understaffed. Service was very slow. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese crepe, which was awful. The crepe was burned and soggy, pretty much inedible and not to mention vastly over priced. My friend ordered the stew, which was alright."
25,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food and location.
Two stars less because the toilet was disgusting."
26,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Ambiance is great, staff is friendly and food good. Price is great comparing to quality of food. Toilets are clean. For French people, keep in mind that ""pancake"" there, is a ""crêpe"" so really thin but it was consistent !"
27,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Got a nice little lunch here. I had a panini and my partner had an omelet. They also serve larger meals such as hamburgers and goulash and traditional meals likelike hutspot and hachee. Good selection. Friendly staff. Nice atmosphere. …
28,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Perhaps a good place when you have no kids. But take no seat when you have.
Not having special kids menus is fine but it's not possible to order plain pasta without sauce e.g. The only answer is, the cook is not doing this. …"
29,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool place with a vintage atmosphere. Would recommend to sit outside if the weather is good, the delicious omelettes and the canal will really make your day! Also, the ladies that work thete are very polite and smiley. Excellent service, would recommend 100 %."
30,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We got traditional Dutch food of a savory pancake (ham, cheese, and mushroom) and pea soup. Both were great! And our server was nice and prompt! Lots of street noise sitting outside."
31,De Oude Wester, 2 stars ,5 years ago,This place looks amazing.  The menu is really good. Just really let down by ridiculous waiting times and very rude staff.. we waited 40 minutes for 1 pancake and when we asked the waitress how long it would be she was very very rude and …
32,De Oude Wester, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Stumbled upon Café De Oude Wester on a relaxed Sunday afternoon. Outdoor seating, nice waitress, relaxed atmosphere, great! Only to then be heckled and called stupid and rude by another waitress on our way out for walking out of what appeared to be a door. Apparently it wasn’t, who knew."
33,De Oude Wester, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"This is just a tourist trap. Service is brisk and efficient, but the real attention paid to food, wellbeing of guests is awful. Food quality does not exceed the most basic level. …"
34,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious little pancake cafe. We tried the spicy chicken (which was chicken & mushroom curry), the spinach & goats cheese, and the Hawaiian (ham, cheese & pineapple). All tasted great, and the service was charming. I'd happily return."
35,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,2 years ago,Horrible customer service from the waitress & even worse service from the manageress. My wife & I have never been talked to so rudely in a restaurant. …
36,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We were clients on the terrace, and we understand it was busy because of a national holiday, but there was such an aggressive and hostile manager forbidding us to go to the toilet (actually screaming at me for trying to get inside the …"
37,De Oude Wester, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Waiter were to the point and harsh. Not that they were bad, rather they came off gruff and slightly annoyed to be there. Service otherwise was average, then again...we ordered a bitterballen, ham and cheese sandwich, and pancakes …"
38,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,3 years ago,Ordered a banana pancake. Expected a fried banana with some sauce on the pancake. What I got was a cold dry pancake with half a sliced banana. Very disappointing. Then the cheek to ask Euro 10.00!! No effort was made at all and the service was not great - very surly staff. Not recommended.
39,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We had the salmon and a beef stroganoff. They were pretty good. We sat outside, it was a lovely day and a nice location across from the canal near the Anne Frank museum."
40,De Oude Wester, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Just ordinary small eating place, very local with the worst served food, and quiete expensive. I was served chicken soup,  which was just warm water and few flowing veggies and few stripes of so called cooked chreded …"
41,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This Cafe has a history of almost half a century. A great location in the hart of the old town, looking at the Historical Wester Church. Now these days when tourism is putting its mark on the town you will notice that the locals do not come …"
42,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We had the goulash which was delicious & came with a yummy salad also got the poffertjes for dessert which we nice but probably not worth the price as you only get about 7. Overall quite pricey but good food
43,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Poffeetjes are okay but the chocolate sauce they serve with pancakes etc is not nice at all. They close their kitchen around 21h and were too eager to send us away but still not too bad
44,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been here a couple of times on trips to Amsterdam and I enjoyed it both times. The layout of the place could be a bit less draughty, but the food was so good it made up for it! I'll probably visit again on my next visit to the city."
45,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's an ok place, in a great location.  We had a great waitress in charge of our table, super nice and happy.  The French fries and pffortjes were the best things we tried."
46,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Their pancake is thin like crepes, but the size of a small pizza (fills the whole plate). I really enjoyed the mushroom as cheese pancake. Delicious!"
47,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Seems like a nice small cafe. Good and fast service. Unfortunately, the savory pankakes are soggy. There not disgusting, just not good. And as a Canadian, don't try the syrup here."
48,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great homemade authentic dutch cuisine. It was delicious, friendly staff, and had a big variety of food options. Highly recommended"
49,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Not so good. Had to get in three times to ask if we could be served outside. Got some bread with fried eggs with cheese and ham and a cappuccino. About ten minutes later my belly started to ache. Then I got really sick and spend the rest of the day on the couch. Thanks ""Cafe de oude Wester"". You made my day..."
50,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Really poor experience. Menù is old-school, we took a chocolate pancake and was pretty bad. Then the final surprise, they didn't wanted us to pay with card, after 10 minutes insisting we paid with card and they were pissed off"
51,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,3 years ago,"If you want to eat, this is not the place, very expensive for the food it's served, the environment and decoration is great, they should try to have presentable food for the prices they charge. The beer is good though."
52,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good food and nice service 😊
53,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Its written Home made Dutch cousine.

57,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,a year ago,Service and location is good
58,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice little cafe for breakfast. They don't like it if you wanna make changes to your order. Food was pretty good
59,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,6 years ago,"We ordered 2 paninis with pesto tomatos and cheese. And all we got was dry bread.
For that and 2 bottles of water 20€. Too much!
Waitress was unkind and hectic. Never again."
60,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food and service. The employees speak English and the menu of the day was a lot of food and pretty cheap for a restaurant. I recommend it.
61,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Asked for a sisi, got a fanta Orange... asked for a lipton green tea lemon and got fuzetea lemon green tea... they dare to ask €7,- for this. Overpriced even for tourists. Personel speaks only English not Dutch."
62,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Sitting outside in the sun was a lovely option; however we seemed to get forgotten about sitting out there and we had to stare through the glass to try and catch the severs eye whenever we wanted service! Pancakes were only OK and priced according.
63,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was great! Really added to the trip. The staff was very friendly as well. If you are traveling to Amsterdam, I recommend this place!"
64,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,7 years ago,Food was mediocre at best but the wait staff were absolutely abysmal. Twice we had to go up to the counter because the waitresses were too busy chatting to take our order. Parts of the order were also forgotten. All in all - terrible.
65,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"JUST TO BE CLEAR FOR PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A CAT CAFE, THIS IS NOT ONE! It comes up when you Google cat cafes but doesn't actually have any cats that we can see😂 food is good though and so is the chocolate milk, but there's an arsey waitress but she is probably just sexually frustrated."
66,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,5 years ago,Was told where to sit not even a good morning. There was plenty seats available. Served cold coffee and what was supposed to be a toasty was 2 slices of dry toast no butter and 2 slices of ham. Crap
67,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Just a drink and think whether you are going to eat, is immediately asked to leave. Arrogant employees. They mist out on a good client.
My advice, never ever go here"
68,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious food, good music, nice service and very positive vibe , for sure we’ll come back here :)"
69,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Pancakes are well enough. The place is a little dark and can get loud, but has plugs and is a nice play to be for a while after visiting Anne Frank's house or the Homomonument."
70,De Oude Wester, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Staff were lovely, however food was not so great...kitchen was also located downstairs next to toilets which I found shortly after finishing my meal. Unhygienic :("

73,De Oude Wester, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Service was horrible. Just one, maybe two servers and they were just grumpy. Food was mediocre. Not worth the time or money but it was conveniently located to where we stayed so we gave it a shot."
74,De Oude Wester, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Great place. Nice staff. Food not so great. We tried the dutch speciality dish hachee and it wasn't really good.
75,De Oude Wester, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Skip this place. Better go to McDonald's.
Food is not a traditional food but a non taste having food.
Even the famous chips was comibg from a frozen box.
Don't worth the money"
76,De Oude Wester, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great old fashion cafe. We had tomato and green pea/bacon soups. Delicious.
77,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Couldn't have a drink past 14:30 cause ""lunch was still on."" Place was half empty and several others were just drinking something aswell. Were not so kindly asked to leave."
78,De Oude Wester, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Colorful, small restaurant with a varied menu. We had pancakes, a good selection of sweet and savoury filings."
79,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,2 years ago,The food was actually not that bad but the service was bad and it was expensive for what it was. 12€ for 2 bottles of water really ?

81,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,8 months ago,"6 euro for a Palm bier of 25cl, tourist trap"

85,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,4 years ago,I went in to get lunch today and a woman in a black shirt was rude and hateful to me for simply asking for a glass of water. She refused to give me her name.

92,De Oude Wester, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Mediocre service and food. The Cats were nice though.  The bar maid is a magician, watch your coins."
93,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,8 years ago,Such a pretty looking establishment in a beautiful area but the waitresses ensure that this will be the most dismal experience of your visit to Amsterdam.
94,De Oude Wester, 1 star ,2 years ago,"7 euro for an Affligem blond, everywhere else 4,30 euro. Glass was dirty too. Tourist-trap..."
