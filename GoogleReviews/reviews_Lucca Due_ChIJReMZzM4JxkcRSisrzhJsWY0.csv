13,Lucca Due, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Disappointing, I don‚Äôt recommend the porcini pasta which were tasteless and really really really fat (oil + cream)"
14,Lucca Due, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I do not agree with people stating this is good value for money. There is nothing really the matter with the food. It is 'fair'. But 45 euros for a pizza, a pasta and three drinks it not cheap by any means. I would even expect some food ‚Ä¶"
15,Lucca Due, 5 stars ,5 months ago,First time we were here following a recommendation by our hotel and today we have been here the second time. Antipasto misto was marvelous and Pizza Calabrese one of the best pizzas we ever had.

Will be back."

21,Lucca Due, 4 stars ,a year ago,Great place in Amsterdam with delicious food. Both pizza and pasta were great. The homemade meatballs as antipasti were one of the best meatballs I have ever had. This place is excellent with respect to price / quality. Nice service as well. Would recommend this restaurant!
22,Lucca Due, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious pizzas! Make a reservation, specially in weekends since it gets very busy. The restaurant is cozy, but does require some beautification (painting walls, dusting, etc.). Service is friendly."
23,Lucca Due, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Good food & delicious tiramisu, friendly staff."
24,Lucca Due, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What an amazing recommendation by our hotel staff. Simple and delicious Italian food. The highlight was their restaurant cat who was napping on a windowsill next to our table and then decided to move to our toddlers stroller! Overall a great experience for tires and starving people who had just gotten off the train from London!
25,Lucca Due, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"We tried the pizza, pasta and veal. Highly recommended."
26,Lucca Due, 5 stars ,5 months ago,I love the setup of the terrace in the courtyard of the church. Very homey vibe to the food and atmosphere. Really liked the carbonara!

32,Lucca Due, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Of all of the places we ate on our European trip, this place was the absolute WORST. No one greeted us when we walked in. I had to flag someone down to get a table. Once we got a table, I had to, yet again, flag someone down to take our ‚Ä¶"

41,Lucca Due, 4 stars ,a year ago,Excellent food and service; despite the pizza being fantastic I can highly encourage you to try some of the antipasti.

42,Lucca Due, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The staff here are very friendly and accommodate any language even bad Dutch attempts although may be a little slow with the bill. The food is great and there is a great choice. Best of all is the general atmosphere in this restaurant.

65,Lucca Due, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great pizza, great calzone, great beer (although the selection is not very varied). Close to Amsterdam Centraal, and a nice way to end a walk in the center of the city. Warm atmosphere and really polite and helpful staff. I'll certainly go again when I have the chance.

67,Lucca Due, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great moment. The service was perfect and one of the greatest pizza I‚Äôve ate!
68,Lucca Due, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food. Staff looked after us all night. Slightly unusual in how they'd leave cleaning buckets piled up in the middle of the restaurant. But didn't distract from a lovely meal.
69,Lucca Due, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Recently ate here twice on a 4 day trip to Amsterdam. The food and prices was just that good! Between those two trips and a party of 4 we tried two appetizers, 6 entres, and one dessert. Each and every dish was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend!"
70,Lucca Due, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was excellent but one of the waitresses has a serious attitude problem. I mistakenly said we booked for 5 even though it was for 6 people, and realized it right after we were seated. After I told them she just rolled her eyes and ‚Ä¶"

76,Lucca Due, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Disappointing.  The 4 dishes we tried were lacking in flavor, texture,  and temperature.  The manager was nice. Our server  was constantly gone for very long periods. A large portion of our short time in Amsterdam was wasted here."

80,Lucca Due, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Outstanding pizza in a place which looks small from outside but inside is like a tardis. Ask for a table in the hidden courtyard if the weather is good, to dine under the tower of an old church. ‚Ä¶"

92,Lucca Due, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"If I am not mistaken, this place used to be Toscana, a place I used to go to quite often. Now, it got upgraded to a slightly more fancy Italian formula, with stone-oven pizza's, more authentic Italian food, etc. I can't say that I feel like ‚Ä¶"
