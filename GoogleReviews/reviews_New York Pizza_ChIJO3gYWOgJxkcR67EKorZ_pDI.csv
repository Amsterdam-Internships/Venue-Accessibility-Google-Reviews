0,New York Pizza, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"I had gone to this place for 4 years ago. I liked their PİZZA but i can not say same thing for the man giving pizza. I had wanted 2 napkins politely because of my flu , he had looked at me like i am his enemy."
1,New York Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious and value for money. Love their 4 cheese pizza. Great for a quick snack as you can buy per slice. Love to eat there every now and then
2,New York Pizza, 1 star ,5 months ago,Had a slice of pizza here once was just about to leave and see this guy getting sick right next to me turned me off the food hopefully next time my experience is better for now it’s only a 1 ⭐️
3,New York Pizza, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Fresh pizza better than pizza hut. Staff were alright and prices were a bit high, 8 euros for two slices, the taste made up for it though. The interior could be upgraded though, one couch was all ripped up."
4,New York Pizza, 5 stars ,a year ago,It was unexpected great experience in the middle of a touristic place. The food was so delicious and the service was amazing. The guy who’s working there is so cool and polite.
5,New York Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved the pizza here the meal deal was good value for a pizza and a choice of drink (we had chocomel cans) €10 will definatley return here tandoori chicken was very nice aswel as the other toppings would definatley recommend
6,New York Pizza, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Value for Money, esay eat. Good taste and wonderful customer service. I really recommend that place for pizza lovers. Even the guy i thing his name Mahmoud he was really helpful and he recommended to us beautiful places to visit in Amsterdam."
7,New York Pizza, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Good and affordable. 2 slices of pizza and a drink for 8 euro
8,New York Pizza, 1 star ,2 years ago,new york pizza chain is generally good. But this particular outlet of the chain serves very bad Pizza. They did not have many items from the menu. Although the menu said 30 cm pizza they were serving smaller size. What they served was a …
9,New York Pizza, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great Pizza!!! amazing taste and feel like it's an italian pizza :-)
10,New York Pizza, 1 star ,2 years ago,Complete scam artists. First of all they charged me 25 euros for my pizza when it should have been 15. Second we came in and ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza and they said they didn't know what sausage was but claim to be a New York …
11,New York Pizza, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Taste good not WOW .. cheese slide has a little cheese
12,New York Pizza, 1 star ,a year ago,Reheated pizza and not the best either. The price was expensive and we didnt enjoy the food. The guy who served us had zero customer service skills
13,New York Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I fully rate this place for food quality and cleanliness too and serve is great too
14,New York Pizza, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very dirty and you have to pay to enter the bathroom which has no paper, and smells horribly. I didn't like it. The food is so so... A lot of onion and i asked them not to add it. I waited for my Pizza 30 minutes though it was not busy. The personal is nice though."
15,New York Pizza, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Great pizza. Would be 4 stars if they got their logistics right (sometimes you can't order because they're doing deliveries or they ran out of dough). Would be 5 stars of they took care of their interior and kept it a little cleaner. Food is great and cheap though
16,New York Pizza, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is the best pizza I have ever had in my life and trust me, I have had a lot of pizza. The crust is GOLDEN brown and the texture is perfect, soft but also with a slight crunch. Diverse selections of toppings, though I jut went with the …"

21,New York Pizza, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The only people who could call this NY pizza have never eaten pizza in New York. The crust was all wrong and too thick. Decent, but not NY style. The garlic dipping sauce was not good, tasted like poor quality ranch."
22,New York Pizza, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice pizza but maybe a bit expensive, which unfortunately is normal for being in the center"
23,New York Pizza, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Order a medium pizza, and was kept waiting for half hour. When I checked after 15 minutes it was plain they forgot. Then served up some cold ""pizza biscuit"". I live local in Amsterdam, and most takeways are reasonable at worst. This one - avoid! Hygeine also suspect."
24,New York Pizza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The personnel was really kind and kept their promise. They promised to make me the best pizza of Amsterdam and he made me a chicken Buffalo which was really nice. At first i was sceptic because its a pizza with cheddar on the bottom, but it …"
25,New York Pizza, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Eh .  It's corporate lunch pizza.  Cardboard.  But if you are hungry, it fills the belly.  Beware, a bottle of water will likely cost you as much as one or two slices.  Staff is 50/50 from friendly vs pay and please move on."
26,New York Pizza, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Surprised to be able to order a gluten free pizza here. A quick in and out snack type of place. Service was fine, pizza was too."
