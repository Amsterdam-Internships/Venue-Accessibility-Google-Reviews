0,Village Bagels, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Good service, good selection. Music was maybe a tad too loud. The bagel we had was tasty. A good solid place to stop and have a coffee... Though a little slow getting the coffee :)"
1,Village Bagels, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Delicious food. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Nice music. All you need after a long day.

11,Village Bagels, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to watch the world go by. My favourite is the BLT with really crunchy bacon. It is really tasty but I think like a few other reviews it's a bit on the expensive side for what you get. But don't let that put you off alone.

24,Village Bagels, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Quite pretty, tasty bagels, good service"
25,Village Bagels, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Beforehand, I love bagels and have high standards for them. Bagel was okay at best in taste, barely any salmon on there and 1 slice of tomato... and that for 7.70 for a salmon everything bagel. The everything bagel didn't have everything either. And the salmon is for sure not cured in house. People could have made this better at home."

31,Village Bagels, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly people who make good bagels.you can have anything from peanut butter and jam to salmon and cream cheese. All yummy! Conveniently located in the center and close to the hotels.
32,Village Bagels, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Ah! Forget what you know about bagels and try this. Visited Amsterdam for 3 nights and ate here everyday ‚Äì couldn't resist. Fresh produce, interesting combinations and great variety of bagels. Try the chicken and avocado w. sesame bagels, or the pastrami with mustard sauce. Service was also good. Nice to sit outside when it's sunny."
33,Village Bagels, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Staff was rude, service horrible. I was shocked when I saw them making faces when we changed our order .Absolutely unacceptable. We will never go back there."
34,Village Bagels, 5 stars ,4 months ago,You are really a beautiful meeting!üëç
35,Village Bagels, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Generic ""hip"" place. Bagels are prepared without any passion and too expensive for what you get. Hummus tastes exactly like the one from Albert Heijn, something I wouldn't expect."
36,Village Bagels, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent bagels and coffee, also very centrally located. However for what you pay, what you get isn‚Äôt the best value - there are better tasting ones out there for similar prices."
37,Village Bagels, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Sorry but this is a messy place. Bagels taste old and the girls never wash there hands when handling food after cleaning the floor, wiping their hair, doing the washing up or moving bins and boxes. Terrible Bagels and all over priced. And slow service. So in my view...keep clear away."
38,Village Bagels, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great little coffee/bagel shop. Not over touristy. The food is good and the coffee as well. Their coffee is not the most consistent (a latte and cappucino had the same amount of foam).
39,Village Bagels, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Great place with little tourist. Tried the cream cheese with strawberry jam bagel and a cup of coffee. Small but cozy place, with a very nice staff, but it gets really hot during spring.  Anyway, I do recommend."
40,Village Bagels, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Bagels are ok. But the service is super slow. If the place is half full you might be waiting for 30 for your coffee and bagel to come out. Needs some efficiency boosting.
41,Village Bagels, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really tasty bagels, good espresso, chill vibe, and a good place to get some work done while people outside strut along one of the busier crossings in Amsterdam!"
42,Village Bagels, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"A good place to stop off and grab something to eat and drink some coffee. The music is soothing and the overall ambiance gezellig, as the Dutch would put it. In my opinion, perhaps a bit overpriced."
43,Village Bagels, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A variery of fresh bagels, tasty combinations and wonderful staff. A great breakfast experience if you're looking for a good quick bite"
44,Village Bagels, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"Friendly service, nice latte. Muffins were ok, will try the bagels next time. Nice place to chill out away from the normal tourist spots"
