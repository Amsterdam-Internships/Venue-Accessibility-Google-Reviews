0,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,We had lunch in this restaurant and it was a really nice experience. The staff is sympathetic and professional and the food is really nice and fresh. Delicious warm bread and nice wine. The only thing I found annoying is the sound which is …
1,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Tasty dishes individually, but we were struggling to find the common theme of the menu. Worth trying the oriental oysters and the onion “martini”."
2,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Overall this is a delicious restaurant.
The service was great and the waitresses were always smiling and patient.
We ordered the foie gras which was perfect. …"
3,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I really enjoyed this restaurant. The wines of this restaurant were not that expensive, but their flavour was great. Bread was really good as an appetizer. The Martini was really tasty but even though for me it was enough but for some …"
4,Ron Gastrobar, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"The service was slow but that has become the norm during COVID with poor staff retention so understandable. The menu was very tough to decipher and cumbersome. The BBQ (meat) section says ""you can pick the size"" as the price is per 100 …"
5,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,We enjoyed our early dinner. Food was delicious and staff was professional. Extra kudos as we brought a toddler along and staff was really friendly. …
6,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Excellent steak and beef tartare!
We visit this restaurant while in Amsterdam. We had the beef tartare and the dim sum for starters. A very creative approach of the dim sum both on presentation …"
7,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Amazing dinner. So far one of the best place I ever eaten in Amsterdam. Congratulations to the Chief for the perfect balance of flavours and the hi quality of the ingredients. Really tender and perfectly cooked meat. Thanks also to the floor staff for the knowledge and welcoming atmosphere. Just perfect. I will come back for sure.
8,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Incredible experience!!!!!!
The food was out of this world.
We will defenitely go back for more. …"
9,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Truly magnificent as an experience.  The tastes in the dishes are fantastic.  The staff are very cheerful and explain the different menus and dishes very well.  The prices are very reasonable.
10,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Came to Amsterdam for a mini break with my partner, we landed on the Sunday and came here for a couple of drinks. The bar tender who served us was professional and extremely polite. He knew all cocktails off by heart and was happy to …"
11,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The best experience we have in Amsterdam. Greatest atmosphere. Very good meat. We hardly recommend

14,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"We had food and wine take a way for New Year's Eve. The food was delicious, the wine was top class. I highly recommend Ron Gastrobar."
15,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wonderful tasting menu. Ingredients that I never would have chosen but combined to make delicious dishes. If you dine between 17:30 and 19:30 you get a 20% discount on the whole bill.
16,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"An exceptional culinary experience at affordable prices. I enjoyed a 5 course meal and 2 cocktails for about 60 Euro. Was 20% off if you leave before 7pm, definitely worth seeing if that deal is active :)"
17,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was not sure that we have enough time to visit it and wasn’t dressed officially, but we went there. The place looks very beautiful and  I felt myself a bit confused in my shorts and shirt. But the staff was very polite. …"
18,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great dinner with excellent service and food. Boneless pork ribs is full of flavor and tender. Side order of mushroom is made of different mushrooms and so flavorful I can have two. Head lettuce salad is fresh and accompanied with marinated …
19,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,2 years ago,Actually we are disappointed. Almost all food were really salty. And no good service. We informed that one of us is not eating pork and we got... butter with fried pork. No suggestion for coffee or something extra. …
20,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Although the surroundings were eloquent, the service, champagne and food were well below par.  Our server was surly and looked bored as though she would rather be somewhere else, and this unfortunately spoiled the whole evening.  She served …"
21,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A wonderful restaurant. This is perhaps the least pretentious and most enjoyable Mich 1 star we have visited. The food was real food wonderfully prepared. The staff is delightful and smart. I wish I lived up the street as I would be a regular.
22,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,My girlfriend took me here for my birthday as a gift and it was very nice. Complex and wonderful flavors inthe dishes that were served. As a main course we had the beef Wellington and it was very tasty but a bit too pricey for what is being …
23,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The a la carte menu is a bit tricky as there are lots of supple costs. (spoiler alert, don't order the lobster) Ordered 4 dishes and 2 sides. Turns out almost as expensive as the 6-course tasting menu (for 2 persons). On the bright side, …"
24,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great Place!
Super creative dishes and the taste is amazing.
The Spareribs are really a must do. …"
25,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,4 months ago,Thoroughly disappointed. This restaurant managed to ruin my night twice. How could they do two!? Read on! …
26,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"The place feels casual as does the people dinning there. The food ranges from ok to great and there is an adequate wine list.
Instead of the usual tasting menu there is just an a la carte selection of …"
27,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,4 months ago,"This restaurant is absolutely despicable! They gave us the most terrible service of a lifetime approximately 3 months ago; after multiple complaints, they eventually gave us a voucher for a full evening dinner with them. When we finally …"
28,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"I was still hungry after I left!

Style over substance: the food was fine but small and I was still hungry after I …"
29,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,3 months ago,"First, the host told us there was an available table. As soon as we said we wanted to have drinks and appetizers, she was rude and said there’s no table for it.. I wouldn’t expect such rudeness from a Michelin restaurant…"
30,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I visited both for a lunch and for a dinner, in the botanical terrace, a beautiful setting rich in plants.
The service is friendly, and I like that the mood is more informal and relaxed …"
31,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"A must try in Amsterdam. Good food, good vibes and great service"
32,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Had lunch at Ron Gastrobar on Saturday, I informed them about allergies of my lunch companion when I reserved, the hostess at the entrance confirmed it when we entered the restaurant, I really liked that also the waiters were aware and …"
33,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food and service. All dishes were outstanding, from the Spareribs to the black angus steak. The atmosphere was enjoyable."
34,Ron Gastrobar, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"the place is high end which requires reservation in advance. the staff is friendly.
the food itself is pricy and small which is expected. …"
35,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,4 years ago,It's our second time here. We reserved our table online indicating that we would like to seat outside without sunshine. They have plenty of place but let us wait for five minutes before they decide that we couldn't choose our preferred …
36,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Michelin’s start is on the front door. I think they can keep it :). Jokes aside, it is a very nice place, food is very good and service is as I like it (invisible). Good work!"
37,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Overall a good experience. Disappointed by the much raved about spareribs. The meat was dry and the glaze overly sweet. The sambal that accompanied this dish was the highlight afterall. …
38,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I went to this restaurant with my partner in Sep. I was really disappointed there. Because the service we received was terrible. When I entered the restaurant, I asked for a table but the staff told us about the restaurant being listed on …"
39,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"5 star experience, meals and service. This is one of the top restaurants in the city. High-class kitchen. 15 Euros for any meal - portions are small so they recommend you to take more than 1. We took 2 meals each and it was enough :) Highly recommend the salmon tartar"
40,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I have been at Ron Gastrobar more times and it is always a pleasure to spend some time there. Excellent service, delicious dishes everything done with attention. The wine list offers good choices between valid alternatives. One of my favourite restaurant in Amsterdam."
41,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,5 months ago,We have celebrated birthday and really enjoyed food and service
42,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Good location (but be careful don't go there by car that can be difficult to find a parking spot), good food, excellent service. I was there for lunch and make sure you have enough time: waiting time can be a bit too long of you need to go back to work."
43,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Thoroughly enjoyed my first visit and certainly not my last. Menu had many choices that will please. Great spot in the heart of Amsterdam and venue provides great views of Amsterdam. Amazing how only going to level 5 gives you such views. …
44,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Thoroughly enjoyed Ron's Gastro Bar. Very nice ambience. Food is very creative and Delicious. Very reasonably priced for higher end food. Good Lunch menu also. Do some really nice wines to go with the food.
45,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Incredible restaurant! Super cool, amazing tapas, beautiful presentation and excellent food. Great service. A must go in Amsterdam. 1 michelin Star."
46,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice outdoor terrace, the steak was disappointing, though, the performance with steaks display was nice, with they had the bone marrow separately, it was the best part of the steak. …"
47,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food for all courses. Beautiful presentation and excellent, complex flavours. Contemporary, exploratory food. You will definitely experience something different here. The food is also quite filling. The service was easy and not too …"
48,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing experience!
Had a blast with my brother, his girlfriend and my dad. Enjoyed the excellent food and great service. …"
49,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I loved almost everything about Ron Gastro Bar, especially the bacon-crumbles butter and the famous egg dessert, but everything was spectacular. highly recommended. Make sure you reserve a table in advance."
50,Ron Gastrobar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Well decorated dishes but not the taste you would expect from a Michelin star restaurant. Disappointing overall - we’ve tried most of the fish dishes and none was incredible. Lunch around 70eur pp.
51,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Staff and food was great.
Great lunch deal for a Michelin restaurant!"
52,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Excellent food and great service. They were able to adjust the menu for gluten-free
53,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I went to Ron Gastrobar during my short city break in Amsterdam. I'd recommend the place to everyone going to the city. The staff is very kind and professional. The food is just delicious. I was enjoying every bite :) i also  got a cute …
54,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Loved all the food and the atmosphere, The service and even the reasonable price! Highly recommended to spend time with others with great food and drinks."
55,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Exceptional value, I ordered from the à la carte menu, and enjoyed every dish."
56,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Unique fusion restaurant with friendly atmosphere and professional service. Perfect ribs! Small portions at first glance but in the end it's enough to be full. Food beautifully presented.
57,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Cocktail is great. Omelet and mussels are good. Lobster and spareribs are ok. Sides are ok.
58,Ron Gastrobar, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Honestly, quite disappointing. Poor and slow service (didn't have an opportunity to even order food until we'd already been sitting for 45m). Meant to be a share-plate type of place but no dishes seemed intended for sharing and were a bit …"
59,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We've managed to book the place 2 weeks in advance for a dinner. Had a nice long walk before so we got our appetite quite strong when we got there. The lady at the entrance was amazing, the welcoming was warming and in good English, they …"
60,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Innovative and uncommon, tasty dishes (think scallops served looking like cheese cake, brains, Wagyu beef, chocolate egg ""surprise""). Service so-so / half-hearted, unfortunately."
61,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Experience is good, food presentation is ok, had their famous spareribs i heard but not that really special though its boneless and quite unique for having sambal sauce but how the food presentation is violaaaaaa....ambience is cozy and …"
62,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,4 years ago,Worst experience ever. So disappointed. Takes more than 2 times longer than what they promised. No explanation or excuse inbetween. We had to watch all the people around us leaving. There were so many dirty flies flying around while we were …
63,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Really special food. It's more an experience what is possible with food than actually eating it. But: the dishes are awesome and very tasty and you'll love it. …
64,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Service is friendly but completely incompetent.
Gave us the wrong dishes/made us eat pork which we would never do in our life. Apology was a complimentary glass of wine. Which is ridicolous. …"
65,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"We loved everything about Ron Gastrobar. The food and service were amazing. The prices are fair.
We will come back to Amsterdam just to visit the restaurant 👍"
66,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The food is really good but the service is just a little overstrained. They brought not all the dishes at the same time it was just strange. But still the food is amazing!!
67,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing place. Great food & friendly staff. Will definitely be back.
68,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely place to treat yourself. Fantastic customer service and great food with a price range for everyone. The free bread starter and ice cream dessert were a really nice touch to finish off an amazing meal!
69,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,2 years ago,Got here at 1pm. This is the look of the restaurant. All empty tables but they would not seat 1 person. Said they're booked. You're closing at 2:30. I doubt there's a massive group of 30 people all showing up to eat. Pretentious pr**cks
70,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty food, special dishes, excellent service, good interior design"
71,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was OK, and the service was really bad (slow and unattentive). I didn't enjoy it. The restaurant looks great inside."
72,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"While the prices may be a little high, you get what you pay for in flavor, uniqueness, and craftsmanship. The waitresses are extremely knowledgeable about what they are serving you and the ingredients used. Very professional but super cool at the same time!"
73,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best food I've had in Amsterdam. A nice, laid-back place to eat a great meal."
74,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,a year ago,"It is always a joy to eat at Ron Gastrobar. I will recommend to anyone always to choose the bar. The interaction with the staff is nice and it is a cosy place.
In summertime sitting on the terrace was for me doubtful next to the busy road, …"
75,Ron Gastrobar, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Overpriced, boring food – understand is a nice place to go, but I expected much more from place w/ Michelin Star, much more."
76,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty, quality dishes. Portions are small so you can order two per person and share, although its pricey. Wine options by the glass are good. Service is good when they are speaking to you, but it is difficult to get their attention. Staff is spread thin."
77,Ron Gastrobar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Found this a mediocre experience with a lack of personal touch and disappointing service. We ordered the 6-course tasting menu and the food was good but we were waiting up to 50 minutes between dishes (and the first 2 are raw meat and …
78,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Love the food. Service is great. Toilets could be more feminist. While my boyfriend was entertained by a repetition of football goals causing him to spend at least double his regular time in the bathroom, I heard conversations around parenting. Old. Fashioned."
79,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice restaurant. Food is good - sizes not very big, could easily be shared. Everything is prepared nice and tasty. Service is on a good level. …"
80,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is definitely a 5-star restaurant. Bear in mind the management team is not doing a great job organizing the staff requirements for the (high) demand they get. …
81,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Gourmet preparations, select local ingredients, and a nice contemporary decor. The cocktails are expertly crafted. We enjoyed the mackerel sashimi, and a small dish with veal organ meat. Yummy. Great place for a date. Pricey but worth it. Close to the park, where you can walk after your meal. Reservations a must."
82,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lively, cosy and noisy brasserie style restaurant serving succulent small French dishes.  Michelin star well deserved and worth every penny spent!  Truly delicious food and funny, casual staff. One of my favourite places in Amsterdam. …"
83,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Consistently excellent food, and truly astoundingly good service. An absolute delight."
84,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Unpretentious, creative and hearty food for a reasonable price. The service level is in keeping with it's ""pub"" feel and is more casual. We sat at a large table on the patio. There was another group at our table but far enough away that it …"
85,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Order the short ribs! Really lived this place. On the pricey side and totally worth it. Would recommend making reservations. Tried the french toast and egg surprise for dessert, and would say the egg suprise was way better."
86,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,a year ago,"First time was mind blowing. Second experience was a let down because the first was so good. Can’t do the six course tasting anymore, and a friend had a really disappointing experience with the chorizo cabbage. My inexperienced pallet was still happy though."
87,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice food. We had the 6 course menu that offers a great variety. Unfortunately, our waiter was not too competent, letting us repeatedly wait 10-15 minutes for simple orders like a glass of beer, or forgetting to open a bottle of wine he brought to the table."
88,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A unique dining experience! Tons of wonderful flavors, cool pairings, and an awesome outside seating area. Our drinks were Thai basil and they came in little plastic bags, kinda like Thailand! My old fashioned had a bit of popcorn that added wonderful nose/smell/aromatic pairing with the cocktail. Highly recommend!"
89,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, wines and atmosphere"
90,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Had a lovely dinner at Ron Gastrobar. It has all the quality without any of the pretentiousness. The food was beautifully plated and delicious. The portions are not big, so it is best to order about two per person. Due to the price, that …"
91,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food was generally of a good quality and well presented. Quite rich and heavily sauced. The idea of sharing plates seemed a bit ridiculous as quantity was at times ludicrously small and at €17.5 each a bit rich. Nice wine reasonable service.
92,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great restaurant! reasonable prices!
93,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I enjoyed the small, delicious and inventive dishes at Ron Gastrobar, and i I very much liked the format - we made our own tasting menu with 5 of their medium-sized dishes, two sides and two deserts. The atmosphere was more ""upbeat"" and …"
94,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Great place to dine or enjoy a lunch at Michelin star level. Menu is reasonably priced. Lot's of small dishes to choose but also lot's of (highly) overpriced; €275 2 person steak / €85 caviar croissant. But, overall a great place. …"
95,Ron Gastrobar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"No friendly greeting, no offer to take jackets, dirty chairs outside. Less than mediocre experience in this restaurant. The food was on the very! salty side and temperature was off. The service varied per waiter, there was this male waiter …"
96,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Last summer I had an excellent dinner here, booked last-minute. I have no idea how, - but somehow my Hotel Concierge booked a table for 2.
The restaurant serves up immaculate rustic French Gourmet dishes. Both in flavor …"
97,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We were 4 for lunch, using the Groupon offer (25Eu/pp for two savory dishes, one dessert). The hosts and the waiting staff were very pleasant and helpful. We sat outside in the covered area - with balmy weather it's an airy, very pleasant …"
98,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This restaurant hardly deserves any Michelin Star.

My boyfriend and I went for dinner to celebrate his birthday. …"
99,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The good: the food was really tasty. We enjoyed every dish. We ordered all small plates as opposed to sharing larger cuts of meat, as we wanted to share more items. Everything was very well prepared. I am giving 4 stars because I hope we …"
100,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic restaurant. The food quality is top notch and because of the small sizes it's perfect to share with the rest of the table. If you don't go crazy on the wine you can easily dine for 100 euro for 2 people. The patio is also great.
101,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, great service, nice terrace. Is it worth a Michelin star? Maybe not. But perfectly fine food at this price range. Have been here around 10 times and always very friendly smiling staff who proactively offer you to taste some wines …"
102,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, not every course to our liking but fine - nice wine selection as well, but no wine pairing offered for the 6 course menu. Horrific service though - slow, unattentive, multiple waiters that kept confusing the language. Without …"
103,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,a month ago,Fantastic food and great service
104,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice place. Perfect for a romantic date. The portions are quite small, so you might want to order 3 dishes per person. They have delicious wine. Though it's quite pricy."
105,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Having recently spotted this place while looking for nice restaurants to eat in while visiting Amsterdam I was nothing short of blown away by both the food and service. This place I believe, was a real find! …"
106,Ron Gastrobar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Had been curious about this place for quite a while. Turns out the reviews are accurate, super long waiting times in between dishes and for the check, over 3 hours for a 6 course tasting. Food was good but nothing amazing, the foie gras was …"
107,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,I had such high expectations for this place but unfortunately it was very disappointing mostly because of the service. The lady that we got as our server barely listened to us and got our order wrong. She was also very rude in many …
108,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food and most of the dishes were excellent. 5 stars. However, the service was not so good. Waiter brought us several dishes we didn't order and then disappeared. Long waits for some of the food. And when it was time to get our coats, nobody could be found so we had to go into the coat area and find them ourselves."
109,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, good service. Highly recommended."
110,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great restaurant. The food here is spectacular without being to pretentious. I would say my favourite dished were the tacos starter and the egg with king crab. For desert the coconut with caviar was something that should not work but it did!
111,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very relaxed place! Food is creative, tasty and very attractive pricing. Although the location attracts quite a typical (over the top) audience, the food and staff are really nice (and not over the top). Great atmosphere!"
112,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Top notch restaurant, extremely accommodating to food allergies with compromising the flavor. …"
113,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"For a restaurant described as dialing down the pretense, there was still plenty left.  The food was well-crafted.  Portions were small, but fine for those of us not used to a giant lunch.  Perhaps not entirely for me, but we still enjoyed our meal."
114,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent restaurant. A real experience. The staff is great. They treat you with extra dishes and we even got some ice cream on the way out. The food was excellent, very well cooked steak."
115,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I tried 6 courses taste menu and it was really good. Worth a visit for sure.
116,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,a year ago,Used to be good but not recommended anymore. High prices for medium quality. Slow service and not honoring the promotions still published at their website (Early fork benefit with discount clearly and unconditionally advertised but not honored). Fraudulent behavior.
117,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Randomly found this restaurant when I was googling places to eat in Amsterdam. My husband and I stopped by after spending an afternoon in Vondelpark during a heat wave. We were a little disheveled from our time in the park and the hostess …
118,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"The food was great. Quality resembling the michelin star of before but less fiddly and more substance. The crew was excellent. Friendly joyful and professional. My fried wasn't Dutch and every single one helping us knew and spoke english. Excellent wine to fit the dish. And not too expensive. so yes, i loved it. I'll be back."
119,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Some of the worst service I've ever experienced in Amsterdam, and extremely average food for price and reputation. The complaints written nearly 3 years ago are the same issues experienced tonight, so it seems management is indifferent to the problem."
120,Ron Gastrobar, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Had high expectations based on previous reviews and some recommendations. Overall, some of our dishes were extremely delicious (the tacos, salmon tartare, and the beef Wellington). However the service we received was awkward and well below …"
121,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ron Gastrobar will go down in the books as one of the most surprisingly disappointing restaurants I’ve been to, from the service to the food. We were told we couldn’t sit outside (on a gorgeous night no less!) because the patio was closed …"
122,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Very good food and ambiance. They have also improved the wine list - which was needed. The low rating is because every time I have been there have been errors on the bill and never in my favour.
123,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,4 years ago,Disappointing services. First of all we were arranged to sit under the sun even though we booked well in advance a table outdoor IN THE SHADE. Secondly not just the food is slowly cooked also the services come slow too. Thirdly they simply ignored our request for services. It was really a memorable dinner. Thank you.
124,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good service, nice wines by the glass be it pricy, some dishes better than others.. 12 euro for a small plate of rather ordinary mushrooms is pushing it a bit. You can find better food for less in Amsterdam"
125,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,5 years ago,If this review was based solely on food it would easily get a 5. Unfortunately however our service went from excellent to nonexistent as the restaurant got busier. Both my wife and I finished our glasses of wine after the first course and …
126,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Came here with a group of 9 friends and had a great leisurely dinner. Our waitress was lovely, the food was great and we had an excellent evening.
Would recommend the short rib and sambal, amazing dish; as well as the truffled cauliflower. Yum!"
127,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We dined here with friends in April 2016, and had a bunch of shared plates. The food was really nice, appropriate sized plates, good wait staff and a good wine list. We would happily return."
128,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,5 years ago,"For the dollars, my wife and I expected more.  While the ambiance is pleasant, the service was less than satisfactory for a Michelin starred restaurant.  The Maitre D was pleasant in seating us and providing an overview of the menu and his …"
129,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"There's a reason why this place is highly rated on Yelp, Trip Advisor and just about anywhere. It's deserving of its Michelin Star with their delicious flavorful dishes and friendly wait staff. I made lunch reservations before our trip and …"
130,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Fantastic dishes. Small but each one tastes fantastic. Excellent food. Nice attentive service. Not cheap but absolutely worth it. I will come back when I'm in Amsterdam next.
131,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasty food in an animated environment. Stuff is not as well prepared as you can expect from a restaurant of this status. It was also a bit noisy.
Conclusion: Food is really tasty but it didn't meet the expectations. The good part is that it is not very expensive."

133,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful dining, staff was a bit mediocre I must say. Overall they didn't have feeling with the products they put on the table. Wine pairing was none existing unfortunately and had to be requested once tje food was on the table"
134,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This Michelin 1 star restaurant used to be a 2 star upscale fine dining. But they decided to make the restaurant more accessible and now it's serving Michelin 2 star quality food with 1 star price. Don't miss it, or you will regret it."

136,Ron Gastrobar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nothing special. Just pretentious dishes that don't really hit the mark. Service is not great and the whole experience lacks in personality.
Not worth it. As usual Mich star means absolutely nothing."
137,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We really enjoyed the wagyu kobe style steak but the highlight of the evening were the oysters with wasabi &apple and the smoked eel with brioche &egg salad. Service was better than last time we were here. Try Rebel wine with your Kobe, …"
138,Ron Gastrobar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious. Loved the beef Wellington. Upscale so you need to dress. We were causally dressed and placed in the bar which was fine but felt tucked away.
139,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I had a dinner with another 2 friends there once. I myself arrived the restaurant first and was led to a table. The table was quite small that with all the wine glasses, champagne glasses, water glasses and all sorts of seasoning bottles, …"

141,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We waited 40 min for a dish that was supposed to be shared as stood in the menu (35€) ...after all two peaces of chicken and sauce to pour over.

142,Ron Gastrobar, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"Was looking forward to this one Michelin quality with a twist. The location is nice, great terrace and quality Dutch beers on draft. The food however was extremely disappointing. The rib-eye was cold inside, and there was only one drop of …"
143,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cheapest way to get a 1 star Michelin meal (even a fast food version). Fun way to get the fastfood version is to go for the boneless spareribs (€15) and order fries as a side (€7). They're both excellent. That is a Michelin star dinner, …"

146,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Fantastic food, especially the starters."
147,Ron Gastrobar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The best way to ruin a meal is with terrible service, and that is what this restaurant managed to do. I want to believe that the food was worth it, but the mixture of slow, impersonal, inattentive service is what I’ll remember from this experience. I would hope a restaurant with a Michelin Star would be better than this."
148,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is, for me, the best restaurant in Amsterdam. In the summer Ron's Gastrobar has a lovely terrace. The fibe is relaxed in comparison to other Michelin Restaurants. But best of all is the amazing food. All plates were an explosion of flavors and it looked gorgeous."
149,Ron Gastrobar, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Quite disappointing experience. Service was mediocre at best and food was okay, but certainly not worthy of a Michelin star. Coming from London, the standard of food in NL is certainly a lot lower and maybe that is how this place has gotten …"

153,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"I have gone a few times and always found the food excellent, the service attentive and the atmosphere relaxed. They don't take evening bookings so it's handy to show up with a small group on a busy Friday or Saturday night when you can't get a booking nearby. Good garden in the summer."
154,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very good place for sampling the higher gastronomy in Amsterdam. Good range of dishes and recipes in a no-nonsense ordering scheme. Even better with more people to sample more of the chef's inventions.

Unprofessional service."
156,Ron Gastrobar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I went there by myself and stayed there for about 2 hours! The food and dessert (including the surprise egg) were good but the service is what i love about the place. They were very busy but i was never forgotten.
