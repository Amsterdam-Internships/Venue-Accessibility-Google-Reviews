4,Pianeta Terra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We elected the 4 course option with wine pairings and were blown away by their selections, portion size, flavors and service.  It was on/above par with any Michelin restaurant we've dined at in the past.  Job well done by Fabio and his team!"

6,Pianeta Terra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food with amazing staff. Together you create your personal menu with your diet wishes taking into consideration. The wine pairing with it was also a great selection.
7,Pianeta Terra, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Delicious food, good atmosphere and really professional personnel (not the student type, but seasoned professionals who are friendly and know what they‚Äôre talking about and do so with passion). Highly recommended"
8,Pianeta Terra, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I enjoyed our evening there but the food was a mix of good, great and bland and the wine pairing was poor"
9,Pianeta Terra, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"You can either go with the set menus or have a la carte. The more courses you go for, the smaller the portions will get. Recommendation to not go for set menu courses, the value per meal makes more sense with the size of portions you will get."

My husband and I had the 5 course meal with the suggested wine pairing and we were more than blown away by how tasty and well thought out each course was. Truly amazing food, drink and service. A real treat for the tastebuds!"
18,Pianeta Terra, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent modern Italian restaurant in an otherwise very touristy area of Amsterdam. Small menu focuses on fresh ingredients. Pretty dining room and very very nice, helpful, friendly service. Very friendly to our children, they made them some special simple pasta and split an entree. Vegetarian options as well. A bit pricey."

23,Pianeta Terra, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place was absolutely wonderful! Delicious slow italian food, prepared excellently with attention to our gluten and dairy allergies. The owner/host was very warm and friendly. One of the most pleasurable dining experiences that was not rushed but also did not take too long. Highly recommend!"
24,Pianeta Terra, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice restaurant, but slow to produce the food despite a small menu. Starters were excellent, we had ravioli and squid. However the main course of monkfish took over an hour to come and was poor, over cooked and flavourless."
25,Pianeta Terra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"For sure the Best Italian restaurant in Amsterdam, using the best quality ingredients (from Italy, not from Dutch distributors that you don't know where they come from...) and the owner itself takes time to explain exactly where from Italy ‚Ä¶"
26,Pianeta Terra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic place with great selection of fresh food. Would recommend to go for a menu choice to get ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù dishes selected by the Chief. Done it three times and never regretted
27,Pianeta Terra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Exactly what I would expect from a high-end Italian place in Amsterdam: traditional techniques applied to novel and creative dishes. Honestly way better than most food I ate in Italy.
28,Pianeta Terra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good food and very good wine to go with it. A perfect place for a night out with friends with plenty of time to talk in between courses. But with all of this it is in a higher price range.
