13,Drovers Dog, 1 star ,4 months ago,"We were looking forward to eating at DroversDog, but unfortunately our experience was bad. Food was ok, service left something to be desired. Waitress took our drink order and then forgot about us. In the end drinks to 60 minutes to come, ‚Ä¶"

Definitely recommend!"
22,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Absolutely the best coffee in the neighbourhood and maybe even in the city. Very nice and attentive staff. Fresh juices are also a blast. Their poached eggs are really good: salmon and avocado sandwich is great. My only remark is portion ‚Ä¶
23,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,8 months ago,My favorite brunch place for Sunday‚Äôs and sometimes I bring my laptop to work on weekdays. Friendly service and yummy menu. The prices are a little higher than other places though.
24,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Good option for a no fuss breakfast, nothing super fancy but tasty simplicity."
25,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best pancakes in Amsterdam!! Coffee is also great. The interior is spacious. Good for working, too. Definitely recommended üôå"
26,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Good coffee! Small menu and really good food
27,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best burger I have eaten in a long time. Extremely friendly staff.
28,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Food and coffee is always great here. Service can be a bit slow if it's busy but staff is always friendly.  Nice indoor and outdoor seating (covered in the case of rain).

30,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I go here a lot, service is great, they change the menu a lot which is nice, the food is excellent. I would love it if they opened in the evenings during the week."

36,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great place to grab a bite or drinks in the West. They have nich options on the menu. Highly recommended are the pancakes, which are amongst the best in town. ‚Ä¶"
37,Drovers Dog, 2 stars ,8 months ago,Been to DroversDog last weekend and ordered a brioche for lunch and unfortunately it was one of the worst that I‚Äôve had. They had the audacity to served me a burnt toast and the chicken and the bacon was stone cold as well. I‚Äôve been to ‚Ä¶
38,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Fresh and delicious food! Recommend this spot to anyone looking for a full brunch. Add an extra poached egg to the corn fritters and Yu won't regret it. Avocado is an extra touch but not necessary with this dish.
39,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good service, good food, good coffee, good atmosphere, good opening hours. Plus they do breakfast, which every caf√© should but few in Amsterdam seem to bother. More vegan options would make this a 5 star rating hands down; they do have a quality vegan burger though, and the smashed avo isn't bad either."
40,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice hospitality.
Nice food.
Nice place."
41,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious brunch,  nice vibe, friendly staff. Will go again"

43,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Good coffee! Small menu and really good food
44,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Had a cup of tea (loose tea, very fresh and delicious). Also had the sourdough with avocado and a poached egg, very good! Atmosphere is good, clean and service is good. Recommended!"
45,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Been here many times. Love the authentic Australian food. The meat pie is to die for! ‚Ä¶
46,Drovers Dog, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Good service, nice location and atmosphere,  but the food was not that great. It was ok and the portion was generous, but for the price (16,5‚Ç¨), I expected them to be done better, tastier, better ketchup... ‚Ä¶"
47,Drovers Dog, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Usually quite happy here, even though the have a small menu. However quality of service and preparation can vary. For example today I had to wait over 30 minutes for a simple sandwich to go, while it wasn't busy and there where 2 cooks on staff ‚Äì while on other days you get great food quickly."
48,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff, delicious dinner and cocktail!"
49,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great  consistent. Hearty food for breakfast lunch and dinner! It has a nice chill play area for kids. The staff is great and perceptive and friendly, especially the men. The chefs are excellent."
50,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and staff, not too crowded. Ideal to have a brunch with friends or a good coffee. Also have a zone for parents with kids so they can play and have a good time while you're having a meal. Beware: they accept only payments by cards!"
51,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my absolute favorites. I love this specific location due to many reasons; the ambiance is great and cozy in a chill neighborhood, there is the best servers and bartender, I would like to give a shout out to this one awesome guy who ‚Ä¶"
52,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best coffee and best brunch in Amsterdam. A credit to Australian cuisine! Lovely staff and a warm and friendly atmosphere.
53,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Highly recommend this place, for their exceptional food. Calamari, cooked to perfection, not at all chewy. Kangaroo also tender and delicious. Great selection of desserts and they also have an incredible brunch menu which is worth getting out early for! Laid back and casual, but cozy."
54,Drovers Dog, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Deserts are to expensive and coffee is not the best. Kids friendly, nice friendly staff."
55,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Good coffee friendly service nice terrace.
56,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I had the kangaroo.... just to try something different... it was pretty good.
Go early, they sell out."
57,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I've been there twice and it was always full.  Delicious burgers but you'll have to wait about 30 minutes for your meal. Warm welcoming. Good place for solo travellers and for big companies as well.
58,Drovers Dog, 3 stars ,4 years ago,My boyfriend and I just moved to the neighborhood and decided to check out this place which looked cute and cozy.  The restaurant is very nice and has great ambiance.  The staff was very warm and friendly.  We decided to have dinner here ‚Ä¶
59,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great food and great service.
60,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Had a great kangaroo steak here last wednesday. It was amazing (tender and grilled perfectly), I would recommend it too anyone. The beers are also great (especially ice-cold when the weather is hot). ‚Ä¶"
61,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place, my always-go-to place since it's literally around the corner. friendly staff, good menu (more options would be appreciated though, especially for salades, why do they both contain goat cheese :( ) Nice for a saturday/sunday brunch, but around 13 it can be super crowded. The ricotta pancakes are simply to die for."
62,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Great food (especially brunch!), but don't bother sitting outside. For some reason there is a constant flow of junkies and homeless people outside, asking for change. This although is because of something in the area, maybe a social center, the restaurant itself is great and the staff is friendly and helpful :)"
63,Drovers Dog, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Tried it a couple times / second time I went / they had a shortage of chefs and half the menu was available / not cool at all. The menu never changes and it‚Äôs pretty small and basic. They need to bring it a bit harder for modern day brunch in Amsterdam. To bad,  it should be a local."
64,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food, not so big and not so small. Service is good, most are young foreigners with a happy disposition. Get the kangaroo, the burger, the fried chicken, get it all! And definitely get some chips, they're awesome."
65,Drovers Dog, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Went once for dinner and once for brunch and I'm a bit disappointed. Heard a lot of good stuff about this place but in the end there were not that many brunch options and portions are quite small and dishes quite simple for the price you pay compared to other brunch places. Dinner there is better. The atmosphere is nice.
66,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"one of the most amazing burgers I've had.... ever. And I've tried a lot of burgers! Prices are very affordable, the staff is always friendly and nice. It's also a good place to sit and relax with a beer while you observe the Amsterdam city live around you."
67,Drovers Dog, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The atmosphere with the patio on a beautiful day is incredible as well as the decor inside. I came for breakfast and saw some dishes that looked somewhat appetizing. Asked if I could substitute for scrambled eggs because I don't like ‚Ä¶
68,Drovers Dog, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Drovers Dog, another Australian inspired restaurant that popped up in Amsterdam trying to take over the Dutch food scene. Nice try guys, but I wasn't totally convinced. The service was so slow, my son went from hungry to hangry. The ‚Ä¶"
69,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A bit on the pricy side, but I keep coming back. I doubt I can say something that hasn't already been said: service is good, quality of food is good. I like that the menu changes regularly so there is always something new to try."
70,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I had a great evening meal here, a little farther away from the city center (but conveniently close to our hotel). I had the house steak, my wife ate some fish, and our friends chose lamb and burger respectively. Everything was cooked perfectly. So was the atmosphere, the server and the recommended wine."
71,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Been here many times, service is always great and the food is super lekker. Brunch is delicious and for dinner try the Angus Burger or the Kangaroo Steak, can't go wrong with that. Excellent choice of desserts too. Highly recommended Australian place in Amsterdam."
72,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I have been going here for years and while the faces of staff change the food and service quality remain the same. It‚Äôs not a big menu but  what they do they do well. Chill friendly vibe.
73,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is great! Kangaroo and lamp are a must have. Atmosphere is chill and the music is nice. Friendly staff, we had a funny Finnish guy serving us!
Deserts could be improved though ;)"
74,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very kind people beautiful place and awesome products. I love it. Thank you for your servises.
75,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this place. It has a really cosy atmosphere. The staff are lovely and friendly. It's child friendly with a corner full of toys.
The food is really delicious and original. Though a little on the pricey side."
76,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent food. Kangaroo steak is highly recommended. Also family friendly with a special corner for kids. Toys are very dirty though. Quite pricey too with a very high service charge.
77,Drovers Dog, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I am client for years at the location Heemstedestraat. It is a nice and cosy place with quite ok kitchen. I live literally next door, so it was always pleasant to go there and meet a friend. All the years it has been a bit disappointing for ‚Ä¶"
78,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Being a meat lover I must say i appreciate the style of ""dovers dog"".
Small men√π but kinda accurate, you can choose also some special of the day which they looked very tasty with a trendy touch in the plating style. ‚Ä¶"
79,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious and strong coffee. Went for a breakfast, extremely satisfied. Wooden chairs and tables create a cosy atmosphere. There is a seperate children & parents section, which is convenient for seperating the noise from singles like me. ‚Ä¶"
80,Drovers Dog, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Drover Dog Heemstedestraat is an ok place. They have a great children's area although no facilities to change a diaper. Staff is friendly and the coffee is ok.  My food could have been better. Corn fritters were lukewarm. I suspect they ‚Ä¶

83,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The Egg Benedict is amazing. Ask for added salmon and avocado.
Great price for nice cocktails. Fresh made cakes and a lovely atmosphere. Highly recommended."
84,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ozzy steak sandwich was super delish, lovely staff, nice 'brunchy' atmosphere. Overall great experience. Already recommended to friends and family."
85,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"My favorite place in the neighborhood, amazing food and super friendly service. I hope you will reopen soon"
86,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Meat pie was good, kangaroo skewers were awesome, and I don't have words to describe the lamb shoulder. Definitely check it out if you're in the area, but don't surprised if they're about full even on a Monday night!"
87,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, the kangaroo fillet is highly recommended. The lamb rack is also very tasty. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice."
88,Drovers Dog, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Chef is clearly trying to be creative with some of the dishes but they don't all work. ‚Ä¶
89,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Highly recommended.  Good vibes and good tucker.
The kangaroo might be nice but it‚Äôs not authentic Australian food really, unless you're a dog or a cat. I lived and worked there for over 40 years and never saw ‚Ä¶"

If you don't eat meat, worry not; the vegetarian pie was amazing as well.  I've ‚Ä¶"
92,Drovers Dog, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Not as good as it used to be. Eggs Benny used to come on sourdough, now it's just on cheap, flaky white bread. Same price. Plus the service is a bit sluggish, when it used to be very good. Food's still nice."
93,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very friendly wait staff and solid food. Came for brunch twice and Bloody Mary‚Äôs below average with too little or no horseradish or pepper. Again wait staff are super nice
94,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The grilled chicken thigh salad with pumpkin is soooo good. Go back for this over and over again. ‚Ä¶
95,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great, fast service with delicious food! Highly recommend the burger, egg Benedict with bacon and poppyseed pancakes"
96,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good place for a spot of lunch, child friendly and staff accomodating. I have been going here for a while and I'd like to see some renewed menu as the one thing that stops me from going more often is the food options"
97,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great quality food. Good pilsner type beer
98,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food in a trendy atmosphere , highly recommend"
99,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Always good and never (too) crowded. The staff is super nice (and often also an Aussie). Go for the dishes with avocado and for sure you will enjoy it.
100,Drovers Dog, 1 star ,6 years ago,"We went for the first time and had heard great things so were excited to try... We ordered 1 hot chocolate, 1 chocolate milkshake, 1 ""Cassoulet"" (beans with sourdough bread?, chorizo w/ egg benedict on top); and another order of bread. The ‚Ä¶"

103,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool australian restaurant, only the pricing is a bit above medium and the paintings on the walls are amature.
However, nice and tasty burgers with orig. Australian waitress. Perfect!"
104,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice location, sophisticated food selection."
105,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious brunch with an Aussie feel and always plenty of homemade baked goods to choose from (just in case you didn't eat enough during your brunch haha)...love visiting! Hollandaise and salmon anyone?
106,Drovers Dog, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Kitchen was closed at 20:30. So the information about ""late night"" dining or even being able to go for dinner there is misleading. Went there and they told us to leave because kitchen was closed."
107,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to take a family with young kids as they have a kids play area and the food is wonderful!  Very good service!  Be aware that they only accept credit cards (Visa), no cash or AmEx."

128,Drovers Dog, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is good, the service is a little slow and it is very expensive for the small portions which you receive. There are other places in the area which have the same quality at a lower price"

137,Drovers Dog, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice suprising spot, with realy good food"
138,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, great service!
Only issue was that I had to pay using my credit card instead of my VTM (Visa Travel Money)"
139,Drovers Dog, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good atmosphere and coffee but stingy on the baked eggs, without much taste, and hash browns not seemingly fresh...Could do better"
140,Drovers Dog, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty burgers, nice snacks. Good selection of meals and wines."
141,Drovers Dog, 2 stars ,2 years ago,It feels like the changed the owner and the vibe changed along. Less friendly staff who seems to be overloaded and the menu is less special.
