0,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 1 star ,a week ago,Extremely rude security guard on the door who chooses the people to go inside so staying in line is a waste of your time. There are much better options around‚Ä¶ I will never go back there again!
1,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 2 stars ,a week ago,"A bar in a de Pijp corner. Decent prices, but the place is a bit dirty and the service was not so good. We also asked to pay separately and for some reason that we couldn't understand we weren't allowed to do that because 'there is only one bill'. Would not visit again if given other choices on the area."
2,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a great night here! Great atmosphere, very busy, good mix of tunes on the dance floor. Seems as though a lot of locals come here at night. Only downside was it closed at 3am."
3,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice place to seat and have a drink while exploring Albert Kuypt market. Food is also available. Prices are a bit higher, while service is terrible. We've been waiting for a waitress 20-30 minutes and when she arrived, she wasn't as polite ‚Ä¶"
4,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 1 star ,6 months ago,Looks good but staff is VERY unfriendly. There are lots of other bars around. Better chose one of them.
5,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Nice atmosphere with quick service even when it is crowded. Prices are good and beer is always good.
6,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Popular with the locals, I rarely heard my open language.  13.50 for a hearty cocked saute, small missed salad and fries with whatever sauce you prefer.
Great price, lovely atmosphere (I can't for the football game) and it was recommended by a Dutch local gal."
7,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place just in the middle of the market. The stuff is very friendly and the food is really good. The pic is tuna sandwich and green tea delicious!
8,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great food. Very friendly staff. Willing to do something for you to make your experience special. And yes you will come back there.
9,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice friendly atmosphere. Creative fusion Dutch dishes. In the middle of the picturesque Albert Cup market in Amsterdam.   About 15 minutes walk From The Museum plan.
10,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 1 star ,a year ago,"The waiters and waitresses are the rudest people we have ever come across. We did absolutely nothing wrong nor make any difficult requests yet from arrival til departure the staff had extremely bad attitudes, we have never felt so unwelcome ‚Ä¶"
11,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Nice staff. Excellent views. Nice coffee
12,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This seems to be a popular place for drinks and a good evening but certainly wouldn‚Äôt advise you to go here if you are looking for a satisfying meal. The most oily, poorly made burgers I‚Äôve ever had, which we received after a wait of 40 minutes! I rarely leave a bad review but this one truly disappointed me."
13,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice restaurant. Service is good.
14,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A slightly strange smell permeated the air, but this may be because they just cleaned. It's right next to the Albert Cyup market. Good burgers, good breakfasts, and GREAT chips. The waitress was very friendly and helpful."
15,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I came to this bar with my colleague Matthew Holden in a mission to find our friend Louisa a mate. The bar was very busy but the bar staff were efficient and the music excellent. They played a healthy amount of ABBA and some awful remixes of Beatles songs. I would go back.
16,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Beers, coffee (vegan alternatives), smoothies...and food. Nice cute terrace in the sun, right next to the market.
Slightly overpriced but probably the case of the whole area. Service friendliness could be improved."
17,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,One of the coolest eateries at De Pijp. It was a sunny day and I sat outside for a beer and ended up ordering a Quiche. This quiche was amazing - very very delicious. The service was fast and people are very polite. The place has a great vibe!
18,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We came for a quick lunch before our flight back home. My wife ordered a Caesars salad without croutons - since she is a celiac she has allergy to gluten. Salad came with croutons, so we returned it and asked for the new one without bread. ‚Ä¶"
19,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy but nice. Good place to go with friends. Large TV, so if it's a day with a good match somewhere, you get to enjoy that. A small duplex area and a small bar. Typical Amsterdam bar."
20,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great bar to hang out and have a beer, I think! Before I could fully enjoy it the space cake kicked in and I lost my mind! Bar staff didn't mind and are probably used to it which! ‚Ä¶"
21,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Service mediocre and overpriced. I was waiting in the terrace for someone to take my order, no one showed up. I walked in to place my order at the end. Went outside for a smoke and surprise there is no  heating. When I paid the bill I was ‚Ä¶"
22,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 1 star ,8 months ago,Dirty place. Spilled beers everywhere and dirty tables with previous people‚Äôs cigarettes on the ash tray.
23,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good location in de pijp, it is just a pub. It is a pity that now you can't sit outside anymore because they close the terrace in the evening. They have a good Cesar salad"
24,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, sooo tasty  but huge portions! Could easily share one meal between two people."
25,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good service, decent breakfast with a great coffee. I'd give more stars but I didn't partake of much of their wonders so have little to go on."
26,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 3 stars ,6 months ago,You can feel they are understaffed.
27,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This bar starts out as a very nice little french bistro, the 'papillon vert', then seamlessly turns into the physical manifestation of the Dutch word 'gezellig' as 'De Groene Vlinder', with Bitterballen, bier and chatting people. At the end ‚Ä¶"
28,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 3 stars ,3 years ago,A popular pub for locals and internationals. Mostly (too) full and the music inside is a bit too loud to have a decent conversation without yelling at each other.
29,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Friendly staff  however the coffe is not so good but the atmosphere is there. If you search for nice place to sit that's your spot.
30,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"A very crowded dive bar in which you can dance and drink the night away.
The crowd is a mixture of young professionals and university students, and the prices are towards the cheap side of the spectrum."
31,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was ok. Beer was nice.
But be carefull!! The waitress tried to take to much money!!"
32,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely service. Food was great too. Just not really much choice for vegans. Would come again.

36,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 3 stars ,6 years ago,It's location and the crowd on Friday night make this a place worthwhile. Any other location this bar would not have been as successful in.
37,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Just popped in for some light snacks and beer but totally worth it for the people watching. Service was good and the people watching great!!
38,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great fun a Friday evening! Really enjoyed myself here! The music is 10/10

41,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Popular bar in the hip pijp area. A lot of locals go there, so expect a crowded place on Fridays and Saturdays."
42,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice bar/pub Dutch style. Not a huge selection of beers but the atmosphere is the right one

85,caf√© de Groene Vlinder, 1 star ,a week ago,"The security guard on the front door was very rude and extremely aggressive. He didn‚Äôt know how to organize the line, so people can go inside safe, instead of letting the first on the line go inside, he was choosing people! I would never recommend this place, such a terrible service."
