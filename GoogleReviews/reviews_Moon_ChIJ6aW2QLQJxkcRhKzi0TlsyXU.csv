0,Moon, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"I had a 7 meal course for lunch on a Sunday. The food was obviously amazing. The quality and taste are definitely 5 stars! The view is probably the best in Amsterdam, especially since the restaurant is moving so you can enjoy 360 degrees of ‚Ä¶"
1,Moon, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Beautiful place with a huge view üòç staff very friendly and helpful, delicious dishes (dining food). You should make a reservation first because it's always busy especially at night."
2,Moon, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Exceptional! Every dish looked and tasted amazing. One of the best in Amsterdam, worth every penny. Highly recommended to have a romantic dinner and for groups to enjoy the evening. The service level is definitely a plus. When you walk out of the elevator the view hits you with everything it has. It's just amazing."
3,Moon, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Overall: it‚Äôs okay and has highlights but it‚Äôs not a must visit.
Let‚Äôs start with the good side: there is high potential - our second course chicken cooked sous vied was fantastic! Portions size was also perfect. As well as ‚Ä¶"
4,Moon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,We loved this place. We had the chef‚Äôs menu and really enjoyed all 5 dishes. They were all delicious and so well presented. Service was excellent and such a good atmosphere. Definitely an amazing spot for a special occasion!

It has been a tough year for everyone, and Moon Restaurant was a wonderful ‚Ä¶"
6,Moon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very nice unique experience. Not to many revolving restaurants around so whenever my wife and I find one we go for it. We were not disappointed. At first I didn't know what to make of the menu and I was not excited. You can choose either ‚Ä¶
7,Moon, 4 stars ,2 months ago,The experience is great. Atmosphere is wonderful and romantic. My personal comment on food is average. Very good customer service.
8,Moon, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Amazing view on Amsterdam and neighborhood.. the food is absolutely delicious..great and friendly service. things to improve is to have a plate for the bread and the service was a bit messy at the end . didn't got the desert menu ..bread ‚Ä¶
9,Moon, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Wonderfull! A great team, a great concept, and a great place for an intimist moment!The service was ""impeccable"", the dishs was so delicious and I know what I'm talking about! Bravo! I recommend"
10,Moon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very nice unique experience. Not to many revolving restaurants around so whenever my wife and I find one we go for it. We were not disappointed. At first I didn't know what to make of the menu and I was not excited. You can choose either ‚Ä¶
11,Moon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Good food, good vibe, good view."
12,Moon, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Worth to come, at first, because of the great view. The rest follows well enough - it is not outstanding, but good enough to make a great outing with friends."
13,Moon, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Wonderful! The food looked and tasted delicious! I've been here 2 times now and it has become one of my favourite places. The view is just stunning as is the the design of the restaurant. The service is also very good. I highly recommend this place :)
14,Moon, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice food, some new flavours and very good experience according to the suggestions that they give. So it's nice to have a sort of background of information about the food you are eating or wine. The view is only nice during sunny days or nights üòâ"
15,Moon, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Food comes out in tiny portions, most of which was less than satisfactory in taste. Drink selection is very limited, despite it‚Äôs full bar. The staff was very professional, and the view was amazing."
16,Moon, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Awesome place for special occasions. It's not crazy expensive. Chicken was the best of my life. I really recommend this if you want amazing food and spectacular view.
17,Moon, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very good food, although pricey.  A unique view of Amsterdam from the former Royal Dutch Shell world headquarters building.  Probably a one-off visit, but our 2-year old granddaughter was absolutely fascinated by the fact that it revolves, giving a 360 view of the city."
18,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"First of all, staff is very welcoming & efficient. Then comes the breathtaking views from the restaurant as it revolves. Creativity in taste is what comes to mind from beginning till the end. What's most surprising is how good sorrel ‚Ä¶"
19,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fancy food with amazing view. Don‚Äôt expect to get full but you can definitely expect great service and at least one hour of quality time with the best view of the city. The wine was also really good. Would recommend for special occasions.
20,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We made reservations for lunch here. The view is amazing and the restaurant slowly moves in a circle so you get a good look at Amsterdam from up high. ‚Ä¶
21,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"this restaurant is strategic situated in the lively tower A'DAM Lookout, five minutes from Central Station. It is the favorite hangout place for high lovers. Reservation to this 5 starts restaurant is required. As you step your foot into ‚Ä¶"
22,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great restaurant with an amazing view over Amsterdam and the river. Make sure to go for sunset! There‚Äôs a set menu so no choice but food was very good. There‚Äôs enough time between courses to make it a real experience rather than just a ‚Ä¶
23,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had a lovely dinner here last week. The standard is 7 courses but you can chose for less. At the end of the 7 courses I was stuffed. For every course there is are two alternatives. The waiters were well aware of my dietary requirements and ‚Ä¶
24,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Moon is a revolving restaurant atop the A‚ÄôDAM Tower in Amsterdam north. It‚Äôs my favourite place for unparalleled views of Amsterdam and the Ij Harbour while enjoying a fabulous meal. ‚Ä¶
25,Moon, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Awesome place for special occasions. It's not crazy expensive. Chicken was the best of my life. I really recommend this if you want amazing food and spectacular view.
26,Moon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It lives up to expectations but they can work on their food to become better seeing they only have set menus. My steak was almost rare and they dont ask how to have it cooked so I could not eat it. The restaurants rotates so you get a great view from 19th floor of all of Amsterdam
27,Moon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fabulous place to enjoy a 360 degrees view on Amsterdam from the 19 th floor of the old Shell building. The restaurant turns slowly and makes a whole turn in 70 minutes: spectacular! We had a Sunday lunch. Nice food and not very expensive. ‚Ä¶
28,Moon, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Edit Aug 2018: Food was delicious and better than our first visit. Service was not up to par though. Service was still scattered with 4 different waiters and the more senior waiters seemed very grumpy and unhappy to serve us. We were not ‚Ä¶
29,Moon, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"The view was goed. The food was just so so, not great at all. For the price, you could find a much better meal somewhere else. The service was really bad, could have been better. We were in a casual outfit, so the waiter probably did not take us seriously. We don't know for sure."
30,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Beautiful views of Amsterdam from a revolving restaurant! Food was also really tasty! Came for a company dinner and we had the five course dinner. All dishes were really tasty! Must visit when in Amsterdam.
31,Moon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food was good and tasty. Not really fan to eat most of the course in a bowl. The Amsterdam sight is amazing. Waiters very nice. Owner should change the table with the precut cheeses as it does not look like very nice. The restaurant deserve once a visit
32,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The most amazing experience if you ever visit Amsterdam. We went for the 7 courses,
All courses were well explained and tasted first class, Thank You to all of the ‚Ä¶"
33,Moon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The service and the food were really awesome. The view is of course stunning. Too bad they have set menu of 5, 6 or 7 courses not too many options. But still worth coming definitely"
34,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"about the food.. amazing üëåordered a 6 course, and it was well prepared, and tought out, first it was a little bit on the sweet side, but that changed with the oisters, and the steak, it was amazing. ‚Ä¶"
35,Moon, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The food was great but their was a huge mistake regarding communication from the server which led to ordering the wrong amount of caviar. The addon caviar from the course menu is not the same as the two other caviar options not included in ‚Ä¶
36,Moon, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Delish, amazing view and friendly staff"
37,Moon, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Ok. I thought it was time for a decent and honest review of the restaurant after looking at the unclear and unjust negative reviews I saw in here. First the view and the 360 effect. At first I didn't even noticed only when someone told me ‚Ä¶
38,Moon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely atmosphere with a superb view. As the restaurants slowely rotates, you'll see every part of Amsterdam from the best spot. Especially the sunset was beautiful. ‚Ä¶"
39,Moon, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This moving restaurant is a very nice and unique experience in Amsterdam at a top location with amazing views. In an hour and 15 minutes you make a complete 360 turn in the tower while eating at your table. Also the food is delicious. So when in Amsterdam Noord, visit this place. It‚Äôs such a nice and upcoming area to go to."
40,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Bought a three course lunch, was positively surprised with the different tastings you also got. An amazing view, and it spins around slowly! Spent 2 hours and went to the ""over the edge swing after"". Great experience."
41,Moon, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We ate here and found the food a little underwhelming. Not the biggest portions ever either. The view was great though so no complaints there. My advice would be to buy a ticket for the lookout tower and if you were hungry, to eat in the ‚Ä¶"
42,Moon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Good food, good vibe, good view."
43,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We enjoyed a great 7 course meal here, great views from restaurant as well. Nice atmosphere, friendly personal with good explanations of the menu items and wines"
44,Moon, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was tasty but not special. Waiters are walking around and come by the table quite often to check if everything is ok (it is a young team, something you like or dislike). Price for the food is high compared to the quality, mostly goes into the special location. The experience was ok, could be improved."
45,Moon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Stunning view accompanied with delicious food and a romantic setting, perfect for that special occasion with your significant other.  üòâ ‚Ä¶"
46,Moon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The view and experience was great. The food was solid, however, do not think it was quite worth the price (based off the food alone)"
47,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, great service, excellent view.
Small-ish portions. Lovely experience."
48,Moon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fine dining with a view over Amsterdam. The restaurant is rotating slowly so you don't have to miss a single spot of this beautiful city. The menu is nice and original.
49,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The views of Amsterdam above are amazing. This location gives you the sights and the taste that makes the city so amazing. A prix fixe location with amazing wine pairing. If you have any qualms about the food they will substitute upon request. Cheers and enjoy.
50,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A real luxury experience over the city! Everything was perfect - food, service and of course the 360¬∞ view! Food was explosion of taste!"
51,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We booked a 5 course meal after going for the swing on top of the lookout. The restaurant turns 360¬∞ so you have an incredible view on the city. Food was delicious and the staff super nice.
52,Moon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was excellent, amazing view
Missed professional waiters and service, very pity for a good restaurant"
53,Moon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Had a great evening here. Service was great and food was really tasty. And of course the view was amazing.
54,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful and delicious surprise sample menu was described as 2 courses, but about half the amount we Americans normally expect. Imagine a saki cup filled with asparagus soup with lovage oil or 4 botes of perfectly seared lamb with green ‚Ä¶"
55,Moon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The views are almost as good as the food! Excellent service and overall experience. The drinks were excellent too. Highly recommended
56,Moon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing view, good service staff, but the food really bad , stay with drinks much better than lossing your money on this food, the experience was good üëçüèª"
57,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food & wine with a spectacular view over the heart of Amsterdam ü§ûüì∏
58,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great view. Good service. Overall nice experience. Won't regret the visit but might not come back only for the food.

63,Moon, 5 stars ,a year ago,We enjoyed the set menu and found it very good value. The chef also sent out a few extra tasters which were delicious. The staff are really friendly and even charged my phone which was running low on battery. You can get to the top to see ‚Ä¶

68,Moon, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Wonderful scenery, small but awesome delicious portions"
69,Moon, 1 star ,4 months ago,"I‚Äôll never forget when they made me wait more than 30 minutes for the bill, disgusting service."
70,Moon, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is average at best. The food looks lovely on the plate, but does not taste anything special. Definitely not worth the price. The view over Amsterdam is beautiful and that is probably included in the price. Staff is friendly and ‚Ä¶"
71,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Views are outstanding and the turning concept is great. Food is totally fine for the price you are paying
72,Moon, 2 stars ,2 years ago,During night time you won‚Äôt be able to see much from the windows due to the illumination they have. The restaurant seems to be a gastronomic but is far from it. Except for the horrible dessert the food is quite nice but the service is ‚Ä¶

75,Moon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is good but not as good as it supposed to be one and two years ago. Is there a massive change in the kitchen staff?

76,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What an amazing location, food was also very good, and service was great. Hope to go again!"
77,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary here and were treated very well! They have different options for the number of courses you would like, but we chose the 7 course and was not disappointed! A little pricey, but you won't find another place where you get to enjoy 360 degree scenic views of the city."
78,Moon, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"A very Disappointing and an Over-Priced Experience!
Coming back to Moon two years after our first (and fantastic) experience our 2nd visit is extremely disappointing. Has the Chef changed?! ‚Ä¶"
79,Moon, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We did not enjoy our evening at Moon.  Very overpriced for what you get.  Service was pretty good and food was okay but again way overpriced.   And very,  dry slow.  We actually asked for the bill before our 6 course meal was done, after ‚Ä¶"
80,Moon, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is slightly below average for fine dining standards. Service staff was nice. The amazing view of Amsterdam is what you mostly pay for.
What was really bad is that we ordered and paid for 6 course menu, only after leaving realized we never got served one of the dishes!!!"
81,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A very memorable dining experience, the best I had in Amsterdam.  Food was sensational and the service was second to none. ‚Ä¶"

83,Moon, 5 stars ,a year ago,"lovely place, food and people :)"
84,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is amazing! The view is just heartbreaking, and the restaurant rotates while you are there having dinner, so you can enjoy the view of the city at 360¬∞. Super recommended, good idea for special events like birthdays or anniversaries. The price is high, but it worth it."
85,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fabulous dinner and wine. Staff were fantastic! Couldn't recommend more.
86,Moon, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Portions are small and service could use some improvement considering it‚Äôs a fine dining restaurant. Nonetheless, the view and the food presentation both get a star. Overall it‚Äôs quite overpriced for what you get and definitely overhyped."
87,Moon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Best view in Amsterdam.
Some parts of the menu were excellent. And others way below expectations.
The margarita pearl was awesome and so was the desert. But the veal was over ‚Ä¶"
88,Moon, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Some of the reviews I read here are unfair. This restaurant deserves a solid 4 of 5 stars. There are still points for improvement, but Moon offers a great dinner experience. ‚Ä¶"
89,Moon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food is nice but I hope you like gourmet food and portions. The view is the best in Amsterdam for sure. The service is a bit slow so be prepared to spend a few hours here; however they are friendly
90,Moon, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Unbelievably bad food! From cold mustard veal to smelly saffron, truffel asparagus,  and simple ice cream for desert! The combinations simple do not go one after another, the dishes are cold or over boiled. I went there year ago, and I know then food was good. Now is just one more tourist trap in Amsterdam."
91,Moon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food, the kindest staff possible. Great views over the whole of Amsterdam. Better is nearly impossible! Definitely the best place to eat in Amsterdam. Be prepared for some costs though. Great food, service and views come with a costly pricetag"
92,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great view, great food and great service. We took the full moon menu and we were not disappointed. The menu was really thought of. The staff really knew how to introduce wines and meals. They were discreets and caring. And of course the ‚Ä¶"
93,Moon, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Exquisite dining. The view is not a gimmick - it is a feature.
94,Moon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Extraordinary views from the revolving restaurant. High quality dishes and good wine selections. Easy to reach via free ferries leaving almost every 5 minutes from behind Amsterdam Central train station.
95,Moon, 1 star ,a year ago,"The food was good, but waiters kept asking if we want to order coffee or if we enjoyed the food in a way that we should be going already since the time slot for dinner was only 2 hours."
96,Moon, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I wouldn't come if it wasn't for the platform that spins 360¬∞ every hour and the view. The food is good but expensive because is very little and the service is average in Amsterdam  (so, super slow -we arrived at 12.30 for lunch and still right now at 15.37 we didn't get the dessert, the last of a third courses menu-)."
97,Moon, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Incredible views - menu was good but not fantastic. Service was good at first but once the place got busy you could really tell. Dishes and pairings came out at awkward intervals with very long pauses in between.
98,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food !! Yummy wine ! And friendly ,helpful staff. (Iysha is gorgeous she served us )  Just what we needed after the Sky Swing !"
99,Moon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely view and concept of the restaurant. Staff is great! Had the tasting menu- very good. Would possibly improve the desert. To sweet and too simple(?).
100,Moon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I am a Food lover, amateur chef, have visited many fine dining restaurants and am very critical when it comes to my food. I visited Moon and do not get many of the reviews here, so decided to write a little review. Before one visits Moon, ‚Ä¶"
101,Moon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great location, when you book dinner. You get to go the 20/21St floor for free, which is the bar and the roof top,with the over the edge swing...saving yourself 15 Euro per person.(this is good) Also when you go for dinner you by pass the Q ‚Ä¶"
102,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A good experience to all senses. Great 360 degree view from the rotating restaurant. Great food with challenging tastes and good service. A bit pricy, but worth every euro."

104,Moon, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The good:
The view is truly incredible. Ambiance is very nice. ‚Ä¶"
105,Moon, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Very disappointed that my girl and I had to provide our creditcard information when we made a reservation and they proceded to reserve 100 euro on the card. ‚Ä¶
106,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Value for money, great view!"
107,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hands down the best view in Amsterdam!! I came for the view even though I thought it was a tourist trap, but the food is really fantastic! Friendly and knowledgeable staff too."
108,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"High end place, where the staff has a sense of humor. I would highly recommend it, especially considering the view! The 6 course meal feels thought through, and has an advanced, yet easily likeable pallette."
109,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect location. Don't go too late, so that you can enjoy the sunset. I hadn't big expectations for the food, but the menu was very good too."
110,Moon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Amazing view, delicious food!"
111,Moon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Love the Food, love the location and the idea of it revolving but Service could be better. From the Manager to the waiters. One waiter was lovely as she was always smiling and made the experience the way it should be."
112,Moon, 1 star ,3 years ago,TL;DR: Avoid this place if you don't wanna embarrass yourself in front of your date. ‚Ä¶
113,Moon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A great experience, this revolving restaurant has very good food, but in a very small proportion and only one set menu so no choice. Enjoyed it  as a tourist one time only visit"
114,Moon, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I quite like the place but its variety in dishes is quite small, and I feel this place is very much just meant as  drinking spot rather than an eating spot, as this is the place where the highest swing is set"
115,Moon, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good food with great view.
116,Moon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I was taken here for a surprise  birthday dinner, very good on the whole, almost unnoticed  service staff as so unobtrusive, as lost in the views and my partner. ‚Ä¶"
117,Moon, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Fantastic view, food and wines. New menu caused a delay, turning the evening quite a bit longer than expected, but staff was friendly, young and enthusiastic."
118,Moon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fabulous views and great place to watch sunset from. Food and drinks a bit expensive but guess this is one of the few spots with such a view in Amsterdam!
119,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Blown away by the 360 view. Staff are very professional and friendly. Food. Wow. Had 6  course menu and it was heaven. Going here now everytime I'm back xxx
120,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A revolving restaurant at the top of the former Shell headquarters, the now called A'dam Lookout. Great cuisine, you need to take your time, at least two hours of fine dining."
121,Moon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasting menu was excellent.  Wine pairing with it was perfect.  Friendly staff and great views, couldn't ask for much more."
122,Moon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice restaurant and nice view
123,Moon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing view of Amsterdam. The food was average and lacking choices and variety. Service was slow and inattentive. Wouldn't go back.
124,Moon, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great views from 19th floor! We had a wonderful three course dinner
125,Moon, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Great views. Food was ok.
126,Moon, 1 star ,2 years ago,Please avoid going to this place and save yourself!! Totally overrated with incompetent staff!! They can‚Äôt even send an email confirmation properly!! Extremely expensive and food is yuck!! Been there once and had to cancel reservation twice.
127,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful and unique dining experience
128,Moon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The turning of the restaurant is a bit of a gimmick. But the food and service was perfect. A pleasant surprise.

131,Moon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Superb location, nice experience, the food not really impressive. Went twice both times the steak was mediocre"
132,Moon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great dining experience although service is on the slow side! Give yourself 3+ hours here for the 5 course menu
