49,Het Karbeel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"We ordered the fondue ‚Äúsuisse‚Äù and I could not handle its taste, it tasted like i was drinking an IPA. My husband loved it, but me not so much. Waited 10 minutes for drinks... I ordered the pasta it was okay, kind of just bacon flavored ‚Ä¶"
50,Het Karbeel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The fondue with mixed cheese and a glass of chardonnay is absolutely recommendable. Service staff is very nice and always up for a great joke. Very cosy atmosphere. Always good to visit after a cold day.

62,Het Karbeel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Good food friendly staff. Annoying that you have to pay extra for veggies for the fondue. All you get is some bread included.

79,Het Karbeel, 1 star ,3 years ago,"old dutch waiter, his collegues called him Eloy? was very rude and dirty, he was playing with his finger in his noise.  chicken sate was raw and cheese fondu tasteless. also the place is very dirty, their are small flies everywhere!!"
