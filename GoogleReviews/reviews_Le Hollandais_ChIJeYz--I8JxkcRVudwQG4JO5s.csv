0,Le Hollandais, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Amazing take away Menu! We have ordered at many restaurants during covid times and this was by far the best fine dining take out experience we have had. Exceptionally good price quality ratio. We could tell that all ingredients were fresh and also appreciate the plastic free packaging! We will definitely order again.

15,Le Hollandais, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent restaurant with very friendly staff. The seafood sausage was out of this world and the Brittany style seafood soup was a good lead in. The cheese board and their generous servings (despite two of us sharing a plate) was the perfect end.
