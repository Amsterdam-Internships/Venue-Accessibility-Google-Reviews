0,Restaurant Shiva, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Horrible Service. Dirty. Scam.

We had several problems during our visit. …"
1,Restaurant Shiva, 1 star ,a month ago,"Would give zero stars, but apparently you have to hit at least one to be able to write a review. Terrible food, and terrible staff service. Definitely avoid going if you don’t want the middle-aged man managing the restaurant feeling you up …"
2,Restaurant Shiva, 1 star ,a month ago,"The restaurant staff (middle aged man) was rude and behaved inappropriately through body language. Never coming back. Please make sure your staff to trained to know how to behave with customers. In addition, the food was undercooked, under-seasoned and arrived after an hour of waiting."
3,Restaurant Shiva, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Nice cosy place. Good service and friendly owner. Nice options for vegetarians. Kulfi and gajar halwa are the best here.
4,Restaurant Shiva, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food, probably the best Indian food in city. However, the staff is cunning in nature, and will throw all sorts of excuses especially if you have booked the restaurant using some discount app. …"
5,Restaurant Shiva, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good restaurant to try Indian food. I visited along with my friends from Japan and Germany. They liked the food very much. The service also excellent. They provided food in less possible time and as per the demands of ours. I recommend Shiva restaurant to be tried by everyone atleast once to get good Indian food.
6,Restaurant Shiva, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It’s an OK OK place. The menu is a typical Indian fare, nothing special or out of the ordinary. The place is clean and cosy. The downside is the staff are not good. It felt like they were just doing a robotic job. No hospitality or warmth."
7,Restaurant Shiva, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Good food, service was the slowest I've ever experienced in my life. Took over an hour to get the first dish. I guess they had a bad night, but still... Waiting so long when you're hungry isn't a fun experience."
8,Restaurant Shiva, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good quality Indian food. I think the manager knows what to recommend and understand your tolerability of spiciness. Nans are fresh and hot, as well as other food. The price is suitable."
9,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Butter chicken perfect! And the best cheese naan we've ever had!
Service's good, its just one lady but a very nice lady (:"

17,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Actually really good food!
18,Restaurant Shiva, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Average starters seekh kebabs needed to be cooked more but the chicken madras was by far the best I have ever had. I would have given 5 stars but the starters let it down I will definitely be back to eat here again

23,Restaurant Shiva, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Mediocre food and bad service at good location. Menus were dirty, salad was dry and there was a hair in rice cup. When pointed out, no apologies, no refund, just took it away and brought back bluntly. Some service but no hospitality. Was not worth it after a great truffle trip."
24,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,a year ago,Try Shiva restaurant in mainland of Amsterdam a Indian restaurant they do have thalis too
25,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is the best Indian restaurant ever.

29,Restaurant Shiva, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was quite good. Portions(quantity) is decent for main dish, not too pricey. They don't have an extensive menu but the usual choices are there, to tinkle your taste buds. Surprisingly, has quite decent biryani as well. Its doesn't have an exquisite ambience, but is a Decent place with nice food."
30,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Everything is very delicious...🎉
31,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A small but recommended place. I had a very tasty (mild) butter chicken with good rice and garlic naan. The food was very good and authentic, the staff friendly. I'd love to come again."
32,Restaurant Shiva, 4 stars ,4 years ago,This restaurant has been around for 30 years and run by a Bengali from Calcutta who also lived in Delhi. The food is mostly north Indian/ Punjabi food. The service is very attentive and the food is quite alright. The portions are generous …

34,Restaurant Shiva, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent Indian restaurant within easy walking distance from Rembrandtplein and de Dam. A friend and I enjoyed a leisurely meal here on Saturday evening. There are cheaper Indian options in the area, but the butter chicken was nice and creamy and the portion size was generous."
35,Restaurant Shiva, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice ambiance, lovely service and pretty solid Indian food. I’m personally more fond of stronger spices and flavors, but if you are new to Indian cuisine or like your flavors more on the delicate side, this place is for you. I got the Sheek …"
36,Restaurant Shiva, 1 star ,2 years ago,"It stays at the Bottom of the list for me if I have to rank all Indian restaurants I have dined-in in Amsterdam in last 2.5 years. The samosas were extremely oily and bit stale, chicken rubbery and the staff not so pleasant either."
37,Restaurant Shiva, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very good food for a low price. Lots of dishes to choose from and a great vegetarian selection. Not all personnel seem to speak Dutch however, which can be a pity for native speaking visitors, however, international visitors will be pleased to get to a restaurant where they will be helped in English."
38,Restaurant Shiva, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It is good place to eat Indian food at Amsterdam centrum, it is very near rembradtplein tram stop. You will need to make table reservation , it helps you to avoid waiting. …"
39,Restaurant Shiva, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"We ordered the vegetarian side dishes and naan. The cauliflower was good but the dal and chickpea ones lacked flavor. The server was friendly until we ordered side dishes, we were simply not hungry enough to order large portions! Very rude."
40,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"One of Amsterdam’s top 3 Indian restaurants, with great service."
41,Restaurant Shiva, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Kind of okey. Not good, bad boy bad either.
Can't recommend this place."
42,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The first time I came here was in 2006 and it's still my all time favorite! Brought all my friends who are coming there now too! The Nan bread is the best Nan in Amsterdam by the way.
43,Restaurant Shiva, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We popped in just before closing and had a lovely meal. We shared the garlic tikka and prawn biriyani, both were really tasty and we would definitely return."
44,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Thank you for an amazing Indian experience and food.  After all the bad places our group of 10 had been it was good to get some decent food.  Although there was a hiccup with our table at the start your food and charm made up for it.  The only change i would make would be the dips you dont get to much for a large group.
45,Restaurant Shiva, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Food was quite tasty. The service is slow but manageable. The lady serving was very polite. The man who served was quite rude . The food I would rate 3 to 4 but service not up to mark
46,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,5 years ago,My girlfriend chose this place and then when they were out of my choice (lamb masala I think) my expectations were fairly low... It turned out to be a blessing though as we got the shiva shared meal instead and it was absolutely delicious. …

49,Restaurant Shiva, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"I told the waiter I wanted something very spicy with chicken and was recommended a Chicken Vindaloo. After some waiting, where I was served some snack to kill the time, the main course arrived. It looked like it would not be enough, but …"
50,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious Indian food! Friendly staff and great atmosphere. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the place. Try the veggie platter, it is worth every bite."
51,Restaurant Shiva, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Good service, but below average Indian cuisine. Limited menu choice and quite expensive for what you get. Better Indian restaurants in the area."
52,Restaurant Shiva, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We orderd the vegetarian menu - it was quite a small portion and not very tasty. I have never eaten such  unspectacular, not-spicy Indian food before. We've been quite dissapointet."
53,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"As Amsterdammers we often eat here when we go to the movies... the Indian food is really delicious, and the restaurant has a good, relaxed 'dining out' atmosphere. The owners are very corteous, in short: it is a pleasure!"
54,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"6 stars. Best service we experienced in our 5 days in Amsterdam, Best Indian food we have ever had and a large selection of vegan/vegetarian dishes. I certainly recommend dining here."

57,Restaurant Shiva, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst service I have ever had. After 1 hour of wait, we asked them when will our food arrive and they said "" if you want yesterday's food then we can give you immediately otherwise we are preparing fresh so it will take time"". Food was not tasty."
58,Restaurant Shiva, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Nobody in the restaurant at 1pm... Should alert me. Only 2 starters availaible in a menu of ten. No naan...😱
Samossa with no taste. …"
59,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"10 star out of 5 star.

62,Restaurant Shiva, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We have read a lot of reviews about this and selected this. I must admit, it has surprised us with the ambiance, quality, taste and service. This is by no means a cheap eat but is worth the penny spent."
63,Restaurant Shiva, 1 star ,5 years ago,"First the quantity of biryani was very less. We ordered 2 Chicken biryani and it was like one chicken biryani, the biryani rice was not cooked properly and when we told the owner about it on the way out she dint even respond."

Indian food. Excellent service and ambiance. I will return to eat here on my next trip here."
68,Restaurant Shiva, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The staff was very rude. On asking for a glass of water, he taunted me saying that this is not allowed and behaved as if he doesn't wants us to serve it, just because we were also having some food bought from outside as well."
69,Restaurant Shiva, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was ok.
But dirty dishes and in the end they were rushing to ""kick us out"" in order to serve more people. …"
70,Restaurant Shiva, 3 stars ,a year ago,I ordered the butter chicken delivered to my house. the butter chicken is 18euro and you'll get that with some rice. 12 small chunks of chicken is for 18 euro too expensive for what you get.
71,Restaurant Shiva, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Not a very good place. The service is polite, but rather slow. The food is not bad but nothing special either. Same for the atmosphere. All in all - I'd recommend to go somewhere else."
