31,Oresti's Taverna, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent enough food (in rather small portions) let down by sloppy inattentive service. To be fair, the head waiter was good, fun and charming. But he was totally let down by the amateurs around him. It took half an hour for someone to …"

46,Oresti's Taverna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We enjoyed six selections from the tapas menu plus a desert and wine and every mouthful was delicious.  The restaurant is comfortable and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. Just a lovely little spot in a busy city.

48,Oresti's Taverna, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice Greek restaurant. The only thing I wish they'd improve is the size of the portions of the food. They could expand it more. I say this because there is another Greek restaurant called Alexandros in Amstelveen which has hearty, big portions and about the same prices as Oresti's"
49,Oresti's Taverna, 1 star ,4 years ago,"This is the worst food I ever ordered. One of these small, not crispy, with 2 little pieces of meat and some fries is 7,50! I can’t believe how crappy it is. The Greek salad is a salad you order on the side as an Appetizer. At this place an …"
50,Oresti's Taverna, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I visited Orestis with my boyfriend because of the positive reviews. The atmosphere is ok.

51,Oresti's Taverna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place. I found the food to be great, if a liitle greasy but still very nice. I wouldn't mark them down on it! Excellent staff too who make you feel at home if just having a beer at the bar. Gezellig!"
52,Oresti's Taverna, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favorite places to bring friends when they come to visit Amsterdam. The food is always good and the wine is reasonably priced.

60,Oresti's Taverna, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Seated at 7:30. Food arrived at 9. I was very disappointed with the new location as I had been several times to De Pijp location with a nice experience. Still two stars because the food was quite good. But service seemed to be having an off night.
61,Oresti's Taverna, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was ok. Small portions leave you wanting more, though, especially for the price. The seats we got were awfully uncomfortable. The service was very slow and inconsistent. Took 30 minutes to bring bread."
62,Oresti's Taverna, 1 star ,5 years ago,I think this was the worst canned food I ate in my life. I do no think the chef went through the effort of changing the canned food in any way. Only after I asked the waitress did she clean our table and I had my meal holding one of my …
