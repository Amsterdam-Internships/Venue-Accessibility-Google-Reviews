In order of favourites:
🥇Pancakes (wow!) …"
1,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A gem! Absolutely gorgeous as a location and delicious food. Rough look, friendly staff. Our entire group enjoyed their meals. Avocado toast and breakfast menus were on point."
2,Bar Spek, 2 stars ,3 weeks ago,"The most terrible Caesar salad in my life, starring boiled chicken with bumpy skin, ugh! Burger was with ketchup instead of sauce. The wait is very long."
3,Bar Spek, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Service bad. Forgot the order, that can happen. Didn’t even ask if we want to order again. We had to ask, to get the food. Then we got leftover fries, that should not happen. Beside an excuse for the waiting and forgetting the food, it’s …"
4,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I really enjoyed this place! Well communicated with tram, it is next to the canal and it has a huge terrace for summer time, which is a big plus for a place in Amsterdam! …"
5,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We ordered a pizza tonno and some fries(they were super crispy!).
The first time I tried raw tuna on a pizza, and it was amazing!! The raw tuna in combination with the lemon zest and capers is so delicious. I would really recommend everyone to try this pizza once!"
6,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"We had lunch in Bar Spek, we had Pizza and Cesar salad both were very well made and tasty, the only thing is it took ages to come... Price was also very reasonable."
7,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Love the food, vibe, great place to work. The coffee is delicious and I think they have the best scrambled eggs in my entire life 😂 compliments to the chef 🤩"
8,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I really like this place and honestly don’t get a lot of the negative reviews on here. Yes the service can sometimes be the typical aloofness that you expect everywhere in Ams, but compared to other comparable spots in the neighborhood the …"
9,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very nice pizza and friendly service. We had a good time there (and we were not rushed).
10,Bar Spek, 1 star ,7 months ago,It was a disappointing experience. School kids walking around without any idea what they are doing. …
11,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My favorite place for morning coffee. Serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. Good service, nice for kids and dogs allowed."
12,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Bar Soek is great for many things. Boozy brunch on Sunday, weekdays business meetings or pizza in the evening."
13,Bar Spek, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,When it's full of kids walking around and talking loud is not the quiet little corner you've hoped for. …
14,Bar Spek, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Completely unimpressed. This place used to be great but there is a general 'don't care' attitude post COVID. I made a reservation and on arriving, no one greeted me or even acknowledged me until I went up to the counter. Told me to seat …"
15,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Had a really nice casual breakfast on the couch. The Lemonade product which comes in a variety of flavors like Elderflower was great. We went by at night and it had transitioned to a busy bar scene.
16,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,With a name like Bacon Bar how can you not stop here. There weren't as many bacon options as I was expecting but the food was very good and the atmosphere was nice. I'm sure this place gets busy but first thing on a Friday morning it was quite.
17,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,While exploring Amsterdam we had the sweetest breakfast with delicious pancakes at Bar Spek . Perfect start! 💓😋
18,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Staff a really friendly, coffee and food delicious. Really chilled out breakfast spot."
19,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,7 months ago,lovely place to go both for couples and solo-traveler
20,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice breakfast and delicious coffee. Fabulous spot to sit outside. The folding bridge in front of the tables a nice gimmick. Also quite inexpensive for the quality.
21,Bar Spek, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Service is slow, but food is nice. Nicer (and cheaper) than others like Roasters and Bakers or The Avocado Show."
22,Bar Spek, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The bar is really nice, service is okay, but the prices are too much. A ginger tea for 3,50 is too much."
23,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The food was delicious 😋 and the service is great 🥰 thank you
24,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great location and amazing food. A bit pricey but worth it. The pasta was delicious!
25,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,9 months ago,The place is big and there's a good distance between tables. There's a good variation of food and drinks. The food however seems to be so so. It's not bad but its not the best either. I believe it's a bit overpriced.
26,Bar Spek, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Bad service, average food, chill atmosphere."
27,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice place... good beer VEDETT try......
28,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,a year ago,"A bit understaffed while I went there, therefore we had to cancel our desert as it took far too long. But the rest of the service was good. I would highly recommend the home made iced tea"
29,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to check out for a beer if you're in the neighborhood.  I stopped one afternoon and the bartender was very pleasant. Lots of room that time of day so I grabbed a comfy spot on the couch.  For a warmer day, they have a lot of outdoor seating with a nice view of the local canal. Very nice."
30,Bar Spek, 3 stars ,a year ago,They have this new mobile ordering system thingy that is kinda good after Corona but you lose the personal touch. Also it took them 15 minutes to bring us 2 glasses of wine when there were only two tables occupied?
31,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best place to get a good breakfast. The people are really nice, and goodlooking! Thanks!"
32,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An excellent spot to grab brunch before heading off to explore the city. The service was great, the atmosphere relaxed, and the cafe was well kept. The food is delicious and prepared fresh for you. There is outdoor seating next to a canal if the weather is nice, too."
33,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I was here twice on the same day. Initially just to have a drink with friends and then after seeing the menu and food, came back for dinner. As we are both vegan/vegetarian, the menu offered some nice choices. Both the service and food …"
34,Bar Spek, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I couldn’t wait to eat the food then write the review, the waitress is unfriendly and unwelcoming she has an attitude, you don’t need to have this job if your a moody. First I sat at the table it was dirty, people after me came and sit …"
35,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It was recommended to me by a friend who loves in the area and it was great! It was pretty busy by the time I arrived and although I didn't make a reservation, they found a place for us to sit. The server was great, I enjoyed the food, and I would definitely go again for drinks."
36,Bar Spek, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The people where nice and friendly, the drinks where good. The beer was great! But waiting 80 minutes for a simple pizza is a bit long. As well the pizza was quite dark and almost cold. But it was tasty, so maybe timing is a problem. If you want to drink something,  this bar is a good choice."
37,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of my favorite places for brunch. Good bloody Mary’s (I’m not a vodka fan so I substituted with gin and it tasted surprisingly good). Their bitterballen are a little tastier than average as well. Bar Spek is relaxed enough you’ll see …
38,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was really tasty. We ordered seconds on the fries. We had a lot of weird food allergies between our group, and the staff were very accommodating. Good music, decorations, and all around nice vibe throughout the restaurant. …"
39,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great seating area. Nice ambiance. Decent prices. Truffle pizza (Tartufo) is delicious. Around 10-15euros depending on if you go for lunch or dinner. Dinner portion is obviously bigger.
40,Bar Spek, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Not bad, good service, definitely doesn't blow my socks off. It is general bruin bar food on a cafe budget. Nice enough view on the canal, but in comparison to other cafes, a definitely 3/5. Good bar scene though"
41,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My favourite place for breakfast / brunch! They do (light) dinner and drinks as well, but I usually visit during the daytime. Nice outdoor seating area, best enjoyed during breakfast / lunch time because it gets the sun at that time."
42,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Another city pearl - a great place to have your lunch. Especially nice in the summer as they have quite a huge sun terrace. I like to watch the nearby bridge / road going up and down as boats are crossing. Quite a nice show for tourists. …
43,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is by the main Street but feels very cosy, preserved and welcoming. Food of Italian inspiration is really quite delicious. Staff is friendly.the terrace on the canal is lovely in the Summer"
44,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My number one hang-out. I come here (very) often for every occasion. Breakfast is excellent here, it is a great place to get a little (laptop) work done, they have lots of newspapers, afternoon drink on the terrace of dinner inside. I highly recommend going here!"
45,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"A good place for lunch or drinks. Maybe dinner also, but don't order any garlicky dishes, they tend to over do the garlic. The terrace is great in the summer and because of that probably difficult to find a spot. But once you have one, you'll be just fine."
46,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The service was attentive and kind but the plates took a long while to get to the tabble. The gin and tonic was delicious and so were the dessert and the salad. The portion was big and very satisfying. It is a very nice place to have a good dinner. The prices are moderate and worth it. Will be here again  proabably.
47,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place for a quick lunch bite. Innovative menu with creative nice dishes. I took the humus sandwich with red beer and friend took sandwich with mushroom and truffle sauce. Both excellent choices. Also great place for working.
48,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Such amazing pizza. Randomly found this place whilst staying on the outskirts of central Amsterdam. Perfect.
49,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place, me and my girlfriend order beer and vine last night. Waitress forgot about our order and we waited for five minutes for our drinks. When we got it, it was on the house. Nice gesture. Beside that really cool place, with cool people..."
50,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice food, good service"
51,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"this place I alway enjoy for brunch.  yes it is a bit busy and pricey but the brunch is amazing/ to die for and it is a nice staff, clean place, and cool vibe.  great for a quick brunch, catchup, or meeting. …"
52,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,5 years ago,A varied range of dishes from the naughty to the nice. Good for brunch.
53,Bar Spek, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Had to wait ages for one of the many waiters to actually serve us throughout the evening, it took over an hour to get our food and then it was just not tasty. Just another overpriced hipster place without any quality. If you are looking for this type of place there are many better ones out there who actual deliver on quality."
54,Bar Spek, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Staff is too slow. Even when food is ready to serve, kitchen rings the bell but takes ages for serving staff to pick up at the kitchen and serve to guests. We weren't asked for an extra drink after they took our empty cups. Not a place for me to return to."
55,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cozy place for dinner and/or drinks. Service was friendly and we didn't have to wait long. the waiter suggested an even nicer and more comfortable table with corner couch, as opposed to an initial slightly cramped table at a window."
56,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,best cappuccino in Amsterdam - great full spell breakfast - lovely terrace looking nah over the canal
57,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice local place with a pretty decent selection of food and drinks; worth a stop if you are in the neighborhood. Food was tasty and the staff was friendly. There is also a small outside space for when the weather is good.
58,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really nice place, the outside is right on the canal, the inside is really cosy and if you sit on the sofas then it's supper nice.
There are not too many vegan options, but still, the service is really good, …"
59,Bar Spek, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Staff was ok and location was not bad. Buuuut just getting bitterballen took 45 minutes. The sandwiches were tasteless and there was barely anything on them. Eggs were covered in butter and not tasty. Veggies that came with it were also tasteless. Overall a really bad experience, especially for the price."
60,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A great bar for drinks off the beaten track in Amsterdam. It's a difficult thing to pull off but this bar has just the right amount of everything to give it a perfect feel. Airy, spacious and multi purpose I'd recommend getting the cocktails in."
61,Bar Spek, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice terrace outside on a canal makes this a good place if you want to sit outside and have a drink in the sun. However, they’re are better places (very close by) if you’re looking to take something to eat."
62,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Nice drinks and reasonable service. A bit pricey
63,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great bar for drink or bite.
64,Bar Spek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice food (decent pizza) and drinks (good beer and cocktail selection!) service slow and not very attentive, not offered a second drink and had to ask for the bill multiple times. Location is perfect, outdoor in the sun on the water, inside a bit busy but always nice atmosphere"
65,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super nice dinner, the meat was actually medium/rare like we ordered (doesn't happen often in the Netherlands)! The atmosphere was nice, friendly staff!"
66,Bar Spek, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Got chased away by wasps and couldn't finish my pizza / meal because multiple wasps dug into the pizza. Got no compensation at all, which was disappointing. On top of that we got charged €5.50 for lukewarm water, which is absurd. Pretty disappointing experience overall."
67,Bar Spek, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Blah. Inattentive service, got the order wrong, food was about as basic as I've seen in an Amsterdam cafe. Wilted rocket dragged across the top of some avocado on toasted white bread. It was avocado toast, but executed about no better than anyone could do at home. Coffee below average."
68,Bar Spek, 2 stars ,a year ago,"They were out of a few items we wanted to order, the bread that came with scrambled eggs was hard, the tosti was one of the worst i ever had, they managed to give me tosti without melting the cheese..how?"
69,Bar Spek, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Our server was nice, and place had a good ambience. Unfortunately, we waited almost an hour for the huevos rancheros and they were less than par at best. Well done is an understatement."
70,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Great interior design, nice vibe and a good terrace. The menu has a got a good balance between very healthy options and tasty guilty pleasures, including some nice breakfast options."
71,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Loved sitting outside, watching the bicycle parade and sipping my fantastic G&T.  The meat plate was huge and the spinach salad delicious.  Perfect spot for a warm night, out of the center, in Amsterdam."
72,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The pizza is Italian style, super crunchy! Environment is chill and comfy. Had a great time there!"
73,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The waitresses are nice. The food is  tasty and we received  our order  within an appropriate timescale. There is a  good value  for money.
74,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Stopped here for breakfast while exploring Rembrantpark. The omelette was very tasty & the coffee superb. Why do the Dutch have such small coffees?!
75,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice waiter, super fast, added an egg but didn't charge extra and the food was good. Not that filling but nice."
76,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very decent brunch, though (understandably, given the name!) not great for vegetarians. Nice outdoor area in the sunshine by the water."
77,Bar Spek, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Nice hip place. Sunday brunch is a bit of a nightmare for service. Food is a bit overpriced for what you actually get and the service was extremely slow.
78,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cozy place with a nice atmosphere. Young crowd. Their Dark'n'Stormy was good, and the staff was friendly. I'll be back for sure to try their food!"
79,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The food is nice and the location is perfect for a sunny day. They have 3 beers on draft plus a great selection of bottled beers.
80,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"nice place, love it. but still dont get, why bacon and cheese are separated from the omlette??? thats the only thing i didnt like here, so not coming for brunch anymore, sorry"
81,Bar Spek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice local vibe, good food.  We had a few meals here, as the food was good and near the flat we were staying at."

85,Bar Spek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely place, drinks are nice but the only problem is the food menu is a bit poor and not much choices"
