4,CAU, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"I had the fillet. It was very tender and tasty.
The corn that can be topped is either tasty or spicy, so not suitable for children."
5,CAU, 5 stars ,4 months ago,One of the best Argentinian steak houses in Amsterdam.Many thanks to Martina for the good advises about Malbek wines from Mendoza and Patagonia same as the perfect Tira de Ancho.

10,CAU, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Although the menu is a little confused, the meat was cooked to absolute perfection. I don't think I've ever had a burger that was so tender. The waiter from Senegal was lovely and very friendly. Recommended break from walking the busy streets."

Amazing place with great food and great service."

13,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice steak restaurant downtown.  Good selection of various cuts and different sizes for you to choose from.

Very friendly server who had no problem at all to fulfill our special burger order. Each part of this dinner was scrumptious: the coleslaw was creamy, crunchy ‚Ä¶"
16,CAU, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Food was decent. Service was very slow, approximately 45 minutes to get the food on our tables after ordering. No side dishes for a steak in a steakhouse. I couldn't even order extra mashed potatoes because they don't make it here."
17,CAU, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best for meat lovers. Good quality steak varieties grilled in Argentina style. Not overpriced although located in the busy street where many tourists are walking through.
18,CAU, 5 stars ,a year ago,We were traveling Europe and were only in Amsterdam a short time. My husband and I were SO thankful we chose this place. It‚Äôs been over a year now & we still wonder what on earth is in the truffle mac & cheese that makes it so good. ‚Ä¶

21,CAU, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I am a huge fan of Japanese wagyu, kobe, ohmi, American Prime beef, angus steak, but this is the best smoked Rib Eye Steak with chimichuri sauce i have ever Had. They cooked it perfectly, well seasoned, and wonderfull service! If you are a steak lover, i recomend their 500 gr special rib eye cut with chimicuri sauce."
22,CAU, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had a great dinner on the 2nd floor with a spectacular view.  We ordered the spicy steak empanadas to start which were delicious but a little small for the $. Then ordered a steak sandwich which had steak done 3 different ways. Wife enjoyed her chicken sandwich as well. Great quality restaurant just off Dam Square!
23,CAU, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Went here with a friend for brunch. The staff was very friendly and helpfull. The interior is very classy, I love the vibe and can see myself getting a cocktail at their bar another time. The food is absolutely delicious. The only thing I ‚Ä¶"

25,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Here you can eat the best beef in city. The prices are average but the service and the quality is supreme. You can locate it easy as is in the centre of city. I tried ribeye , onion rings and frities. The ribeye was tender and very well cooked. Highly recommend."
26,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a superb meal here celebrating my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday on 25th November. Hummus and crispy bread for starters along with sticky chilli wings, followed by a surf & turf and fillet steak for him. The steaks were cooked to perfection! Food was delicious, the Pinot Noir complimented the food and the service was spot on."
27,CAU, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Came to CAU to have a nice dinner, as we were tired of typical Amsterdam street food. Made reservations for 20:00. We were sat quickly with a street view, which are reserved for people who make reservations. Chatted with Vangelis our waiter ‚Ä¶"
28,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Came here for brunch and it was delicious. We ordered the eggs benedict, mushroom with toast and sausage. Bigger portions here. The coffee, latte and cappuccino were also delicious. Definitely hit the spot for breakfast. We sat outside which was nice to people watch and sit out in the sun."
29,CAU, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff is extremely nice, the place is well located and has a good vibe.

For the price, I was hoping for meat of higher quality. It was poorly cooked and the season was a bit off. I rarely have a bad comment, but unfortunately, this one did not cut it."

35,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good steaks. Well prepaired. Pricy, but worthwhile. Staff very professional, knowledgable and enabling. Dont miss the chunky cut fries-  texture is puree like inside, all the while glass like crunchy outside."

37,CAU, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Food was very good, with a main-to-side ratio that could be considered exagerated. A place for people that like stake."
38,CAU, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Overpriced: low quality for high price. Hamburger 15 euros with no sides or anything else. ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs get the fries.‚Äù: was smelling like old frying oil. Don‚Äôt go. Skip this ‚ÄúArgentinian‚Äù restaurant. (if it can still be called so). Average service for Amsterdam."

Good wine selection and menu choice."

62,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We were very fortunate to get in on a Sunday night without a booking. The staff were very friendly and made recommendations from the menu. The steak was great, the sides were very tasty. Probably not the cheapest steakhouse around but definitely one of the tastiest. Great selection of beers as well."

68,CAU, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The atmosphere and the food we‚Äôre both excellent
69,CAU, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I do not recommend at all. They don't know how to prepare meat properly. We couldn't chew the steaks, they were like rubber soles... The sauces are simply not tasty, especially the peppercorn. Even the knives that we got were not the usual knives you get in a steakhouse - took us quite a while and a lot of effort to cut them."
70,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The steak we ordered was 500 g rib eye with chimichuri sauce on top to share.. oh my god it was so juicy .. good appetizer s as well .. and we had the best waiter super friendly from Brazil I think his name was Emilio. We will definitely go again üëç

73,CAU, 5 stars ,a year ago,"very good service, friendly waiters, great foodüëåüëåüëå"
74,CAU, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Steak was okay. No seasoning at all. You have to pay extra for their sauce to add some flavor to it. I didn‚Äôt like the fact that when I ordered grill corn it was oily. I fell for a tourist trap with the amount I paid for without checking too much because I was hungry.
75,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food üëågood service üëç Highly recommended. I had a steak, I had the classic BBQ burger and the sweet potato and they were all superb. Cooked to perfection. üëç Toilet use is free to paying customers which is great!"

79,CAU, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Always busy, best to reserve a table. Staff are amazing, food was INCREDIBLE, place itself is very nice and they cater very well for gluten free.

88,CAU, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The atmosphere and the staff were fantastic. The food is prepared in an open kitchen which is nice, the food was lovely. My only two annoyances to lose a couple of stars were: 1- we sat behind a brick wall so we could not see the front ‚Ä¶"
89,CAU, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really liked it! We've seen some indifferent recent reviews of CAU but we were really impressed. CAU compared very well with Gaucho in London, and everything, from the service to the food to the wine was great.
We will definitely be back again."
90,CAU, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was delicious, the steak was cooked perfectly and packed with flavor. Portions were also generous for the price. I would also recommend the beef stew- the beef was melt in your mouth tender and the stew overall had such a unique blend of flavors. I would definitely eat here again."
91,CAU, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The empanada tasted like a real empanada and the hamburger was also pretty good. They offer 2 kind of fries (we chose the chunky ones and were also good -not oily at all-). The personnel was super friendly and nice. It is a bit pricey though but it is quite expected in that super touristic area.
92,CAU, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We ordered the tasting platter which consists of 1.2 kg of a variety of perfectly grilled meat with some side dishes and wine. The food and service were Amazing. Unfortunately in the scorching 35¬∞ weather sitting in a restaurant with no AC ‚Ä¶

95,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Always an amazing burger here. We enjoyed breakfast at Cau for the first time recently and I enjoyed the Latin eggs, a very interesting concept. I added a sausage which I would recommend to everyone, it was really yummy and enhanced the dish a lot."
96,CAU, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was ok and it looks better than it tastes. I expected a little more. The burger with BBQ sauce I ordered didn't have any BBQ sauce on it (as far as I could taste..) and the ""crispy""  onion rings were just onions covered in 2 inches ‚Ä¶"
97,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic food and good value for money considering it has a high end feel to it
98,CAU, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"An Amsterdam outlet of a UK chain of Steakhouses, serving excellent food. Try the special cuts of steak on offer for a different experience. It gets very busy and loud and there's not much space between tables, particularly on the ground ‚Ä¶"
99,CAU, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The chimichurri sauce here is so good. The steaks are definitely what you order - never been disappointed and never overlooked. The desserts are also great - big fan of the cornflake ice cream sundae. Their salads are also quite tasty - ‚Ä¶

106,CAU, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Great place to eat a burger
And the staff is cool
Recommend this restaurant"
107,CAU, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Probably one of the least tasty Ribeyes I've ever had and the peppercorn sauce was very thin and watery.  My friend added a pepper sauce which was also very basic. Service was fine but also everything is all carte so no included sides with steaks
108,CAU, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The food here was very flavorful and delicious. The Latin burger was excellent if you like spicy food. The steaks were also really nice. Would not recommend the Empanadas however.  Service is good for the most part.
109,CAU, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I absolutely loved the steak we had here. It was perfectly done and much better than many other Argentinian steak places in Amsterdam. I found it a little expensive, but it was worth it. The seating is cozy too and the staff were very friendly."
110,CAU, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Cau delivers great steak and food, however I did find it quite pricey for what you get. ‚Ä¶"
111,CAU, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Steak and the mojitos are excellent. Risotto was undercooked and grainy, and the flavour was somewhat lacking. The peas in the mixed greens side dish was not cooked either. And the baked sweet potato was good. The service could be better ‚Ä¶"
112,CAU, 5 stars ,3 years ago,For the best meat in Amsterdam you go here! Really delicious and lots of variety. There is something for everybody. And don't skip the desserts! Super friendly staff. ‚Ä¶
113,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is an excellent restaurant in the very centre of Amsterdam. The empanadas are superb and I throughly enjoyed the Sirloin steak (medium) and very nice thin cut chips. The pancakes and an espresso was delight to finish off the great meal.  I would highly recommend getting a meal here.
114,CAU, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Had their rib eye which was alright (edible) but definitely not good for the price.  Service was impeccable.  Sides (onion rings, slaw, fries) were mediocre or over dressed. ‚Ä¶"
115,CAU, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Well localised space, very very organized and helpful staff. Good food and service. Relaxed and cosy environment. Good prices according with the service."
116,CAU, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,Over rated. Hamburger was tasteless.
117,CAU, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food and the staff were amazing. Incredibly friendly and welcoming, the process of ordering and receiving food and drinks was very fast. The food was very tasty and filling, and there was a large cocktail selection which pleased my girlfriend. Highly recommend."
118,CAU, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice food and nice atmosphere. the only thing was the staff, they put too much pressure to order, rush, rush, rush and a weird custom of asking you to write how much tip you wanted to put. It makes you feel obliged to leave a tip. But it was a good shout in a busy, built up area of Amsterdam."
119,CAU, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Especially fillet was very delicious...a cup of melih wine option is cheaper than a bottle of beer. However, the only thing we are not satisfied with is the behaviour of waitress in the second floor. Even though there were lotr of empty spaces by the window, they lied to us thats why I am giving 3 stars."
120,CAU, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere and beautiful inside. Very big and spaced They have amazing food, very nice steaks but believe me you have try the amazing Onion Rings. Just delicious i could eat them all day long."
121,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"An amazing experience, great food, we visited twice within 2 days and the Latin Burger, the Steak sandwich are amazing, not greasy at all and full of taste. Qasim is a great restaurant manager he was very engaging and entertaining."

131,CAU, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Very good food for a decent price. Prices look suprisingly low, but keep in mind the steaks are served without any side-dish. It's plains steaks on a plate. So you'll have to order one or possibly two side-dishes to make a complete meal. ‚Ä¶"
132,CAU, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Bad service, gave us a wrong starter, forgot a main dish, tried to charge us some beers that we didn't drink, and tried to charge the bill twice. Meal was really simple, basic cuisine, meat with a poor quality, could improve the empanadas, ‚Ä¶"

137,CAU, 5 stars ,3 years ago,If good quality steak is what you want while your in Amsterdam then this is the place to eat. Cooked to perfection and some tasty side dishes to choose from. Make sure you book as it does get busy.
138,CAU, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Surprisingly good beef stew. Really friendly service staff. Only decent restaurant in the area which didn't turn us away at 10.45 pm. Didn't feel at all rushed and unwelcome even though it was near their closing time. ‚Ä¶
139,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice service.  Sat upstairs.  Very tasty steak, sauces. Tapas, beer and nice company.  Heart of the Old Town area of Amsterdam with color, variety and fun."
140,CAU, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Beautiful steak. Great service and great food. Was luckily enough to be visiting Amsterdam to be able to visit here as all the ones in Britain are closed down. Would definitely recommend but be prepared to notice a lighter wallet.
141,CAU, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow a crowded restaurant, but the service was trying to keep up with all the guests. The food was good, sandwich plus the side dishes were tasty. It's probably a good idea to get a reservation in advance."

143,CAU, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great service and wonderful menu. Lots of fresh seasonal dishes. Good if you want a lighter bite than offered at the other Argentinian steak houses. Good wine prices.
144,CAU, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cau is one of if not the best stake houses in Amsterdam. The meat was very fresh and juicy, we had a ribeye and a marinaded house specialty stake both were excellent. The onion rings have a sweet aftertaste and are very crisp, the sweet ‚Ä¶"

146,CAU, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you walk along Damstraat, you'll see A LOT of Argentinian places. This place might be pricier compared to others but it's definitely worth it. It was one of the best meals we had in Amsterdam. My husband ordered the steak and it was ‚Ä¶"
147,CAU, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Very ordinary and plain steaks. Ate sirloin with no taste. Paper with hint of meat. A bit overrated. Went here because of the feedback. But either they have been drunk or Cua had a really bad day. The burger for my 11 year old was OK, ‚Ä¶"

151,CAU, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good service and location.
The ambience is great as well.
Food quality is not the best, they've got much better steakhouses in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
152,CAU, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Steak was overcooked way past medium rare. Wrong food delivered to the table (was compted ‚Ç¨10 drink). Shrimp were not deveined and hence tasted bitter and gritty. Expensive for what we ended up with even in  Amsterdam
153,CAU, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Excellent meat! we ordered hamburgers - one with portebello mushroom, the other bbq. Both were excellent. The meat soft and juicy, the flavor balanced and rich. For side dishes we took the fries and coldslow, which were fine (nothing to ‚Ä¶"

155,CAU, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Very ordinary steak. Slightly better than how I cook at home. Very expensive side dishes (steak come without any side dish). Nice environment. Overall another overrated place by tourists who are probably high enough to like everything Amsterdam offers them.
156,CAU, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We were in Amsterdam for 2 days, and we came here twice, the food was that good. Their slaw is amazing, so make sure you get one. It goes great with the fries."

158,CAU, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"I ordered the latin burger despite of not being a burger-person. It turned out that I was in for a treat! Burger taken to the next level, may I say....try it together with house' s coleslaw and you will not regret this meal....service also very nice!"

161,CAU, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"A nice , comfortable and relaxing environment within the restaurant. Food is good. Only two things that has brought the rating down is the sheer rudeness of the waiter who attended to our table. Very rude when we did not leave a tip calling us tight. Also the food is highly priced for what you actually get ."
162,CAU, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great restaurant, the best meat in Amsterdam and the staff is just amazing.
A great experience!

The staff if friendly, nice atmosphere. Good for a couple, or even a larger group."
165,CAU, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good food. Excellent service from our waitress. The place does not look cosy, but the ambiance is quite nice. Altough in a tourist hotspot the food was much better th aan expected. There are three floors. Prices are ok compared to what they serve. Would definitely come back here."
166,CAU, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Food was just okay, but they need to be more polite and have more attention ... Starter was forgotten, and then they brought the wrong one, forgot to order one of the main courses so one of our friends had to look at us eating while waiting ‚Ä¶"
167,CAU, 4 stars ,6 years ago,The food was great the starter and main course the meat was grilled to request it was tender and juicy.  The main course doesnt come with any sides. There are plenty sides to choose from and costs about 5 euros each. ‚Ä¶

172,CAU, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It's not hard to find a restaurant in this city, but  sincere conversation and care from wait staff can take some searching. I found it here, along with a generous, juicy steak flavoured intriguingly. Not a flashy joint, but you'll leave feeling well."
173,CAU, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The food tasted fine, but the service was appallingly slow. They were clearly understaffed and we waited close to an hour for our food, and then waited another half hour after we finished to get our bill. Lowpoint of our trip to Amsterdam."

213,CAU, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very poor quality of meat, I've ordered rib eye steak, the taste was like it sat in the refrigerator for couple of days, the manager said ""no way, that's your problem""..."
214,CAU, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The steak was excellent, but you need to order a side with your dish if you order a steak, because otherwise, you only get a steak!
The service was also very good, but be careful, it is not included in the price!"
