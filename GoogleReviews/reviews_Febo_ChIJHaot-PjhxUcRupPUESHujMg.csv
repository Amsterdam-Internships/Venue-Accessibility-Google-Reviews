0,Febo, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"How could anyone like these fries? They are like factory made fries and no taste at all. There are lots of other options in the town where you can enjoy hand-cut, yummy fries...."

5,Febo, 1 star ,a year ago,"imIf you like limp, cold, salt-free fries then this febo is perfect. In addition, it is also great if you pay up to 4.6 times extra for onions on your fries special, you do not get these. ‚Ä¶"
6,Febo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I had to give it a go although I'm not a great lover of sat warm convenience foods, I was pleasantly surprised and ""when in Rome (Amsterdam)"". Maybe the trick is asking for something that has run out on the vending machine and get a fresh one made ü§©. Was tepid and crunchy and filled a curiosity gap. I had the satay one."
7,Febo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It's Febo, you go there knowing what you're going to get. It's an iconic Dutch snack bar chain, where you're assured a certain level of quality and consistency of products. This place is generally clean, efficient, and the staff are pleasant.

13,Febo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Dutch modern food culture at it's best! I took US relatives to have them experience 'eating from a wall' concept. Just a clean snackbar.
14,Febo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"When I was taking away my order I checked: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs mustard in there?‚Äù, and was told clearly: ‚ÄúYes there is.‚Äù It was nonsense. There was also a hair in my patatje. I still give three stars because of prior experiences."
