2,Stork, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The best food experience in Amsterdam over 5 days of traveling. It is definitely worth much more than the 4.2 rating it is attributed. This was recommended to us by a local friend to take us out of the city centre. Indeed the location is ‚Ä¶
3,Stork, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Beautiful location/atmosphere, great staff. Feels like your on a holiday somewhere in Europe. Food was very good but pricey. You can share a dish. So happy we found this gem."

5,Stork, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Firstly, really nice view from the sitting area, it is a straight view to a huge canal and it is very relaxing.
Also, the food was great, looked good that I had eaten half way before I remembered to take a picture for review, affordable also."
6,Stork, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You have to order the seafood platter here, with snow crab legs. The food here is really fresh. The grilled fish was superb; grilled to perfection. I‚Äôm from Taiwan, where we have amazing seafood, so trust me when I say their food is ‚Ä¶"

10,Stork, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We stopped in to get a respite from a biting wind and imminent rain I had a hot chocolate and a couple of cookies, since the actual restaurant was not yet open.  My son, who lives in Amsterdam, attests that the food is terrific, and is by ‚Ä¶"

12,Stork, 1 star ,a month ago,The quality of the food has plummeted here; I ordered a 500g lobster and got a tiny little lobster that could not have weighed more than 300g.  I literally got 6 bites of lobster from the shells.  I told the server and she offered me a 4 euro discount (from 42 euro down to 38 euros).  So 38 euros for 6 bites of lobster.
13,Stork, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Nice place with good seafood. Reasonable prices. Nice view on Amsterdam.
14,Stork, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice lunch. Staff are friendly. I asked beforehand some bottle of cava for my friend's birthday,  staff brought it as soon as we sat down. Thanks.You made our lunch special. Also taking care for corona. Feel safe."

20,Stork, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Really cool place on the water side...
The service was ok but a bit lost...
The dish with mossel and clams  was great but for the rest not really excited... ‚Ä¶"
21,Stork, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Lovely place to sit by the water.  Lunch menu was a bit of a problem for us since we don't eat seafood and generally avoid fish.  But the Eggs Benedict have nothing of that nature beyond some delicious raw salmon.  Surprisingly peaceful within sight of Amsterdam city centre.
22,Stork, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was delish, deluxe seafood tower was decadent...but it took quite a long time for the food to get out during peak dinner time - the staff were constantly moving around; it was hard to get their attention & we even struggled with getting the bill at the end of the meal."
23,Stork, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Nice location in Amsterdam-Noord. Friendly staff. Food is OK. My main course half lobster would have been better with a vinaigrette/sauce with it. Dessert was a delicious chocolate Fondant.
24,Stork, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food was good but expensive.  Atmosphere was lacking. Service was average and disinterested. Stork felt like a factory where they made ok food.  If you are in the area and can't find something more intimate it is worth a try.  Whatever you do don't make a special trip you will find better closer to you.
25,Stork, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great location and huge place in an industrial setting. Ask for table by the window to watch the cargo ships go by. Solid spot for business lunch or just good dinner. Can't go wrong with the whole fish.
26,Stork, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely fish restaurant.
Pasta with langouste is an absolute must to try there. Noticed that at least two other tables ordered it too. ‚Ä¶"
27,Stork, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Industrial design, big former factory floor changed to dinning and wining. I love it. The place has the view, the food and the stuff was far beyond the call of duty. I liked the place"
28,Stork, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fresh and flavorful food. The service was excellent! The restaurant is a 15 minutes walk from the ferry and is definitely a hidden gem in Amsterdam.
29,Stork, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Superb waterfront spot for dining in Amsterdam, specialty is seafpood. This is one of the few places you can eat right at the edge of the harbour, and almost touch the boats as they pass westwards, on the northern shoreline opposite Java ‚Ä¶"
30,Stork, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great space on the River Ij. Had the seafood platter, beautiful and fresh, a seafood extravaganza. Pan fried sole was outstanding, perfectly crispy and crunchy while the flesh was moist and flaky. Nice selection of beers and wine."

They also took the gluten intolerance, mentioned on the reservation, from my wife seriously (unlike so many other places). Till next time"
37,Stork, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Retrofitted manufacturing plant turned seafood restaurant.  High ceilings with lots of open space.  Food was very fresh and delicious.  Great spot for large groups and romantic night out.
38,Stork, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Portions are not even the size of an appetizer, my salad had 3 salad leafs and was way too expensive. But at least it tasted good."

41,Stork, 1 star ,4 months ago,A long and cold wait‚Ä¶. The place is cold as if there‚Äôs no heating on. And we waited for one hour for our main course. The place isn‚Äôt even that full either.
42,Stork, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food. Wonderful oysters. I love how they remodel this old factory into restaurant.
43,Stork, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely space, really airy, right on the edge of water. I've had a delicious pok√© bowl with kinoa, tuna and salmon sashimi, and wasabi mayo. Delicious! Trully filling and light at the same time. ‚Ä¶"

47,Stork, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Sea-food / fish restaurant in Amsterdam, across the river, in the Kromhouthal where 100 years ago they were building engines for ships and airplanes. Then they started building trucks and buses. Then Stork took over to build industrial food ‚Ä¶"
48,Stork, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"I know it is known for seafood - but i took a steak and it was GOOD! Service was minimal  - but maybe that was their thing.

50,Stork, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Service is outstanding and food is ok. Great ambiance.
51,Stork, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Maybe for a low price it would be 4 star. Lobster is small, tasteless. Mussels completely lacking any character. Felt very disappointed."

55,Stork, 1 star ,7 months ago,Extremely unfriendly and hautaine hostess who refused to give a table pretending they were fully booked even if more than half of them were free when we arrived. We ate at the next door bar and even more tables were free here when we left! Not worthy of a second try!
56,Stork, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great food! We ordered one of Stork's Specials: FRUITS DE MER DELUXE and absolutely enjoyed every bite.

64,Stork, 3 stars ,a year ago,"It was okay. You dont have many options to choose if you want to eat specific seafood, like for example just a plate of mussels or shrimps. The dishes also depends on the time, like grilled seafood is only available from 5pm. ‚Ä¶"

89,Stork, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Stork is a trendy fish restaurant located in an old factory hall. The Fruit de Mer platter is pretty good and definitely has my approval! The place has a nice terrace and a plus for locals is that you can anchor your boat here. ‚Ä¶

103,Stork, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The location of the restaurant is quite bad, it is not recommended if you don't have a bike/car, it is about 20 minutes walking from the ferry, if you are lucky it is not a windy day. We ordered a fish soup and the service was quite quick. ‚Ä¶"
104,Stork, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The fish dishes options are okish. We were there to try their fish soup. Unfortunately the taste is just standard. It lacks the wow factor. The location is accesible by bike or 20 min walking from the ferry. By car is not easy but kind of challenging
105,Stork, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice place. The view and atmosphere are great.
The food is simple dishes with good quality ingredients. I would certainly go back for more. A little expensive as the quantities are not huge."

108,Stork, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"You come here for the fish... That's pretty much it. For anything else, you go to another place. With that out of the way I can say that it is a very decent place with nice views. Indoor seating is better than the outdoors comfort wise.

111,Stork, 4 stars ,5 years ago,This restaurant has great views over Amsterdam and has an industrial sort of atmosphere I actually like a lot. The food -it's a fish restaurant- is fresh and really nice. I especially love their North Sea crab and King Crab legs.

119,Stork, 4 stars ,2 years ago,One of my favorite fish restaurants in Amsterdam. The selection of wines is great and the view from the terrace invites to spend a whole afternoon with a large table of friends sharing oysters and a large fish by the Ij River.

124,Stork, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice vibe and grilled seabass was really good. However the the lamb chumb was really small and overcooked (literally 2 bites) and the spaghetti vongole was also dissapointing (overcooked pasta and loads of sand in the clams)

130,Stork, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The location is far away, the public transport possibilities are horrible. The view is nice and the restaurant looks really fancy, but the vegetarian options aren't worth the money or time (the polenta based dish was incredibly salty)."

138,Stork, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is fantastic but super expensive, I was still hungry after the meal. The location is beautiful but a bit far away from Amsterdam. The place is very spacious."
139,Stork, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Great place at the river Ij. Simple seafood at average price and possibly the slowest service in amsterdam. Always understaffed and badly managed. Eastern European attitude to clientele. Pity. Could be such a great place.
140,Stork, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place with good sea food , but not well connected to the city center and I found it a bit overprice."
141,Stork, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Something went wrong with the service but was picked up in a good way. All in all.. if they would improve the service or hire some extra this is potentially one of the best places to eat fish in Amsterdam!
142,Stork, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great spot with a lovely view on the terrace, the food was great and if you order the mussels it's a never ending pot. Would certainly go there again!"
