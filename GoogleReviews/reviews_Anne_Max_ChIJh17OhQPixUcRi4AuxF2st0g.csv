10,Anne&Max, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Average experience at Anne & Max, the staff is fine but the food is average for the price. My salmon sandwich tasted fine but nothing really special.

36,Anne&Max, 2 stars ,2 years ago,No flavor in the food at all. Avocado bread spread taste bland. Oeuf en cocotte is terrible. Bread itself is ok but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place.

41,Anne&Max, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good place to enjoy the morning sun. It's located at quite a busy road, but also a good place to spot other people doing their stuff. The banana cake was a bit weird with the grapes, but who cares. The coffee anyway was good."

52,Anne&Max, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I've worked at Anne&max a couple times. I like the place, environment and food. It can be busy at times but with a good headset that problem is solved.
