35,Melly‚Äôs Cookie Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good coffee, cookies/cakes and sandwiches. Nice and cosy. One star off because the fresh juices are served in plastic cups with a plastic straw, even if you don't order it as takeaway. There are many other sustainable options available for restaurants, so single use plastic is just not acceptable anymore."

45,Melly‚Äôs Cookie Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I'm picky about my cappuccino and, honestly, the one I was served was really good, right proportion of coffee and milk, good coffee base, right fat proportion milk was used as per traditional recipe, and the foam was right, not airy and …"

60,Melly‚Äôs Cookie Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place to find argentine products. I really like stopping here for a coffee and an alfajor. There's place for about 6 people to sit down,
