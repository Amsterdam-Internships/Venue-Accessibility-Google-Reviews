0,Alfonso, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Absolutely delicious!!
Excellent service and fast, super friendly staff!
I'm Mexican, I can guarantee you delicious Fajitas and Burritos. So yummy!
Highly recommended!!"
1,Alfonso, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been sitting on this review for a while to mull it over because while I liked this place, I can't really recommend it. It was just unmemorable. The atmosphere was about as flavourful as the food, and there was nothing else going for …"
2,Alfonso, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Wow, amazing Mexican food. Very well served and delicious plates. I recommend the fajitas!"
3,Alfonso, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Very happy! So yummy and way enough. We had the Fajitas for two and it was the best meal I had in a while. Not cheap but the food is worth it!
4,Alfonso, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff and excellent food.
I had enchiladas, one chicken and one beef which were one of the best I've had. My partner had burrito which looked equally as good."
5,Alfonso, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice food, had the tacos with minced beef to share and then had enchiladas for main course. Expertly cooked"
6,Alfonso, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Super friendly staff and AMAZING food. Definitely coming back here!!
7,Alfonso, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice food and good service but a bit pricey
8,Alfonso, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice food, plenty of choice, friendly and attentive staff. This was my second visit as I enjoyed it when visiting previously."
9,Alfonso, 5 stars ,a year ago,If you are looking for goed mexican food. This is the place to go. I keep coming here. Fajita Codero😋
10,Alfonso, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great Mexican food! Recommended
11,Alfonso, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Tried stake 400gr and mexican appetizer. Was really nice but for the price I would expect a bit better, hence 4 stars. Staff was really friendly."
12,Alfonso, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I fell in love with the place, the lovely owner and the food in particular. It's authentic and has a strong home-made feel to it. Out of 5 days spent in the city, I went there twice although it meant a little detour both times and it was …"
13,Alfonso, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best steak i've ever had. It's comferable and authentic. Great service
14,Alfonso, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Honestly pretty rough overall. Very confused how many 5-star reviews this place has. …
15,Alfonso, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Girlfriend and I got sick when we arrived home. We had the same dish. Food was not Mexican at all, no taste, expensive, total fake atmosphere. We both burned our mouth on the food, it was literally 200 degrees and we had to wait 15 minutes …"
16,Alfonso, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Kinda TexMex. Quite nice. Will definitely go here again.
17,Alfonso, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good food. I was happy with the table service.
The atmosphere is cozy and it's often quite busy here.
If you cannot decide they have several teaser plates or a combo plate you can …"
18,Alfonso, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We had the sharing starter and tried a bit of everything. The empanadas were fried, which was okay, but we usually prefer baked. The jalapeno poppers were very good, just give then 5 mins to cool down. Chilaquiles for main was great. Very generous portion, couldn't finish it. Overall, I'd say it's hearty happy food."
19,Alfonso, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"This was some of the most underwhelming food I’ve ever received at a restaurant. I can’t believe that there are so many good reviews- it is genuinely mediocre at best. The decor of the restaurant is really poor, the food lacked any flavour, …"
20,Alfonso, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I would really recommend this little place while visiting Amsterdam. It was really quiet when me and my bf went here we were the only ones in the restaurant we were a bit hesitant at first wondering why no one else was eating there but it …
21,Alfonso, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I visited Alfonso on Sat 25th November 2018 with my husband and 2 friends. We had the most fantastic meal. Everything came as ordered, was hot, tasty and quite frankly the best Mexican meal we have ever had. I would highly recommend visiting here when in Amsterdam."
22,Alfonso, 1 star ,4 years ago,"This was one of the worst Mexican restaurants we've ever been too. The food is so obviously pre-made (guacamole looked like it was made in a blender), burrito was not even wrapped, but folded (and poorly too, since everything just fell out …"
23,Alfonso, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"They nailed every detail right. Even though we didn't have a reservation on a busy night, they found us a spot and fed us with Mexican food in the middle of the Netherlands! Will definitely come back here."
24,Alfonso, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We really enjoyed our meal at Alfonso's ! The food is good, although the portions can be a little better (especially the quesadilla, it was a little small for my taste considering the price). …"
25,Alfonso, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The food was awesome and the staff were nice
26,Alfonso, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Came with a group and had a fixed menu. Service, food, all less than mediocre. I wish I could say the frozen Margheritas saved the day, but they didn't. Avoid this place."
27,Alfonso, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The service was excellent, the food was okay. We came at 9:30 and it tasted like prepared food as opposed to fresh out of the stove.  The price was moderate for the location."
28,Alfonso, 1 star ,3 years ago,It's Shit. This is not Mexican food. It's probably indian with argentinian stuff in the menu. Not even the manager is Mexican and doesn't even know that tacos are not deep fried. This is TexMex at most. The only thing closely resembling Mexican food are the jalapeños. I'm Mexican by the way. Salsa Shop is a better mexican restaurant.
29,Alfonso, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"RIP OFF.
The ""Chilli Con Carne"" is an absolute rip off. 4€ worth of Chilli con carne for 16€....pathetic. The rice took up 60% of an approximately 30cm plate. There was …"
30,Alfonso, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Fabulous real Mexican food. Not like the bland brit-mex you get in the UK. Highly recommend it. Try the fajitas and fresco. My friends tried their cocktails and we're very pleased
31,Alfonso, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"A little worried after seeing some of the reviews on here, but went. Busy place,  mostly locals. Food ok but not the best/most authentic. Apple juice sold in the smallest glass I've ever seen! Friendly staff, noisy customers!"
32,Alfonso, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food, service and drinks were all excellent! We were a group of 12 and everyone loved it. The location is great and I would recommend!"
33,Alfonso, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very friendly staff and great tho a bit pricey Mexican food main; margaritas average.
34,Alfonso, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Bad service, preheated food, over priced menu. Touristic trap.
Avoid if you can. Soooo disappointed.  Doesn't even deserve one star. …"

102,Alfonso, 1 star ,6 months ago,(Translated by Google) The food was way too expensive for what you get. It doesn't taste like anything. The sour cream is simple quark and the Cuba libre for 7 € tastes like a bad punk-train station mix. All in all a really bad restaurant. …
