2,Café de Dokter, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Was surprised by the good Rating.

9,Café de Dokter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very small, intimate whiskey room. Good selection, but very little seating. You're not there to sit though, so enjoy the vintage atmosphere. Great place to stop by. Will be adding it to places I come to regularly, when in Amsterdam."

22,Café de Dokter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cafe De Dokter is truly such a cool experience. I would definitely recommend this establishment. It's incredibly cramped quarters, but that aspect just adds to the vibe. All the decor is antiquated and in most cases dusty, but that just adds to the vibe as well. You owe it to yourself to find your way to this hole in the wall."
