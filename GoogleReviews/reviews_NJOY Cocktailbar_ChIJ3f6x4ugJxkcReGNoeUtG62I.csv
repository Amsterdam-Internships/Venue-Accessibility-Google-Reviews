0,NJOY Cocktailbar, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,"I loved the cocktails, however, we were seated by often walkable area by the waiter and got squeezed every few minutes. Generally, the ‚Äúcouple‚Äù table was ridiculously small. I would work on optimizing this rather than trying to get as many as possible tables ‚Äútaken‚Äù."
1,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The biggest surprise I‚Äôve had in a while. The staff were great, knowledgeable and friendly. The drinks however were the stars of the show - a must visit even if it‚Äôs in the tourist part. Really really good"
2,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"NJOY is THE Place in Amsterdam. Located in the heart of Leidseplein, it is simply the best Cocktailbar on the planet. I am a 40 year veteran of the industry. I have owned my own  bar / restaurant, my own hospitality / restaurant consulting ‚Ä¶"
3,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Really really nice place!!!! Authentic drinks, not usual grenadine/blue curacao mix fluids as everywere! Expensive but that worth it for 100%! Have tried 3 cocktails and each one was perfect."
4,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,a month ago,A great experience and great vibe. It was a bit less a few years ago but with the return of a key person it's getting back to where it should be. ‚Ä¶
5,NJOY Cocktailbar, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Really expensive compared to other cocktail bars in the city, price/quality is fair. ‚Ä¶"
6,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice bar and very nicely made cocktail they have. Not too packed at around midnight. The bartender and server were friendly. They have some interesting and beautiful cocktails so it would be good to look through the menu to find something new to try. It costs around 13‚Ç¨ to 15‚Ç¨ per cocktail.
7,NJOY Cocktailbar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The cocktails were great! The atmoshere was very nice and the staff very formally kind. The music wasn t that good but ok. It's a nice place for 2 to max 5 people. The cocktails are very expensive but not more than expexted (same prices in every cocktail bar of the same level in amsterdam)
8,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The cocktails are amazing, the atmosphere is great and the staff is extraordinarily friendly. They do everything they can so you feel good and check up on you if everything's still great. Always smiling and never annoyed. Really recommend ‚Ä¶"
9,NJOY Cocktailbar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing cocktails come at a price. Be well dressed when you go here because they value their image as a high quality bar. Very skilled and professional service and high quality produce, very pricey though."
10,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hidden gem in the vicinity of the Leidseplein. If you think of a classy cocktailbar, this is it! The cocktialmenu is very extensive, even hard to choose from. But the skilled and nice staff can help you make a decision. Try their snacks and bites with your cocktail, it's really great. Do take care that it can be busy, so be on time."
11,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Delicious cocktails made with high quality ingredients. Nice ambiance. Friendly staff.

16,NJOY Cocktailbar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,They have wide choices of cocktails. Some were good and some were not. A bit of hit and miss. Good and intimate vibes.

Truly enjoyable experience!"
19,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,a year ago,The best Cocktail bar I found in Amsterdam! The staff and owner are lovely and extremely knowledgeable about mixology. Big selection of high-end spirits in a very classy cocktail lounge! The menu was unique and with their skills you can order off it also. GO!
20,NJOY Cocktailbar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I come here when I'm nearby once a few years. But I'm a bit disappointed this time. I got told some new rules I didn't know a few years ago. But we got in because I made a reservation, it didn't feel welcome anymore. It was to make a great ‚Ä¶"
21,NJOY Cocktailbar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very sophisticated and great quality cocktails. Speak easy style in which you ring a doorbell to get in
22,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best absinthe cocktails I've ever had. Super relaxed atmosphere and very knowledgeable barkeeper. Would recommend it to anyone who wants to try a cocktail that is very well prepared. But make sure you're not in a hurry, as certain cocktails need some time to be prepared and are most certainly worth the wait."
23,NJOY Cocktailbar, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice place but very expensive.
Service was annoying and rude :(
Head waitress insulted my gitlfriend and she flirted with a guy who was standing on the other side of the street. Not a good place to be."

27,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I liked the place a lot: the design and interior is great, the music choice that evening was completely to my taste. Really fine cocktails, either on the card or if you ask to mix something to a specific taste together. ‚Ä¶"
28,NJOY Cocktailbar, 1 star ,a year ago,The cocktails were nice but I was so shocked how the bartender was talking about a few quests. Several guests were denied entry because they were not dressed accordingly.-the hostess let a few guests in and the way the bartender was ‚Ä¶

Location: 3,5 Stars
Bar Keeper: friendly"
30,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great small bar with really friendly staff. Specifically the bar manager Daniel and the small Surinamese girl. Made an highly enjoyable evening. I recommend the Apple Pie and 14 year Oban
31,NJOY Cocktailbar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"One word- amazing. The place is very atmospheric and cocktails are just out of this world delicious! The price is a bit up there but in my opinion it‚Äôs totally justified because the cocktails are really fantastic! Location is great too, ‚Ä¶"
32,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved this place. Classy bar with a dress code. This beautiful bar is located in the center of Leidesplein area, which is typically known as tourist central but the vibe is more elegant and posh.  Top notch bartenders who really know their ‚Ä¶"
33,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The girl at the door was so awesome, she gave us the seats we wanted, entertained us and made us feel soo at ease.. the cocktails where amazing. We wanted to stay for just one drink but ended up staying the whole night. The whole staff has been beyond words. Will totally come back. Thank you guys ü•∞ü•∞"
34,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing cocktails. Very charming bartender who knows his job. Honestly best cocktails I ever had. Prices between 12 and 16‚Ç¨ for a cocktail. But it's more than worth every cent :)
35,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A very chic bar with a good range of fancy cocktails. The staff were friendly and attentative. I got the cocktail with a mix of 4 rums and absinthe...all on an empty stomach. A nice start to the evening. A pricy menu ( average cocktail = 16 eur) but I would say is worth it.
36,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely cocktail bar! Great cocktails, has music like it's a club, but that's every time I've been there never been my impression of the bar so maybe that's a bit overrated. Other words the volume is that high you have to screamüôÑ"
37,NJOY Cocktailbar, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great cocktail bar near Leidseplein, good to get away from the noise of the area. They do cocktail workshops for groups too!"
38,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic place, some of the best cocktails we‚Äôve had! Staff were friendly and the bar staff really knew what they were doing. We didn‚Äôt even have to look through the whole menu as the bar staff asked what we liked and made us a cocktail ‚Ä¶"
39,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice lounge setting, good variety of cocktails. Bartender can personalise to your taste!"
40,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic service and nice, comfortable atmosphere with plenty of seating. Sat at the bar and got a fantastic cocktail that wasn't on the menu, but after simply describing what I was in the mood for, the bartender created something incredible. Highly recommend."
41,NJOY Cocktailbar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"A little expensive for the drinks, and it wasn't that amazing. On the other hand you do get some free smoothies and cucomber water. Still i wouldn't go there again."
42,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great cocktails, good music and cozy atmosphere. As a downside, the drinks will be quite expensive. Also, they keep the bar light, so not very crowded. If there are no more tables, then you won't get in, so take care to plan in advance!"
43,NJOY Cocktailbar, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Good laid back cocktail bar. It is easy to miss since it is located in a very touristic Street. But make no mistake. This place is great once you are inside. Buzz the door to get in. Guaranteed place if you come early but gets crowded later ‚Ä¶
44,NJOY Cocktailbar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Incredibly pricey cocktails and snarky attitude from the bouncer. The cocktails were good, but 1.5-3x the price they were worth. I get that it's exclusive, but the bouncer was snarky as if it was a chore to let us in and once we got in it was completely empty. Not worth the visit."
45,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I'm going there now every time I'm in Amsterdam. And every time there is a new cocktail menu and the taste great. The barkeepers are really nice and with the right cocktails you also get some show.
46,NJOY Cocktailbar, 1 star ,a year ago,I asked the bartender if they have different cocktails then on the table card. They told me that you Only got 3 cocktails till 19 pm. I hope next time they aren't as bored as this time
47,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"NJoy is a 23+ cocktail bar. To be honest I didn't know what to expect before I arrived there, a friend told me to check it out, at first with the closed door and it being 23+ I expected it to be a bit snobby and I was under dressed for the ‚Ä¶"

53,NJOY Cocktailbar, 1 star ,2 years ago,My family and me couldn‚Äôt even get the opportunity to try the cocktails. Sadly there is a dresscode which won‚Äôt allow my dad to wear his ‚Äúshorts‚Äù (basically pants that only go up to his knees). We couldn‚Äôt go back to our hotel to change our ‚Ä¶

57,NJOY Cocktailbar, 3 stars ,7 years ago,The cocktails made in this bar are of very good quality. They really go the extra mile in terms of preparation and presentation of every cocktail. I can especially recommend the 'forbidden fruits' cocktail which has a wonderful soft vanilla ‚Ä¶
58,NJOY Cocktailbar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is very expensive and they are very short staffed. I am used to slow service throughout the city but when the drinks are 15‚Ç¨ and higher I do, at that point, expect the table to be checked on every 10 minutes or so at least. I will not be back. The cocktails were good."
59,NJOY Cocktailbar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I‚Äôve been to a lot of exclusive bars around the world, this is not one of the nice ones! First of all they wouldn‚Äôt let my girlfriend and I in the door because the bouncer didn‚Äôt like the way we looked and because we were American. Very ‚Ä¶"
60,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Came here on recommendation of the server at Pantry.

63,NJOY Cocktailbar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We were refused at the door because our group was to big (20). So instead of making good money on 40 cocktails or so, they refused us because they thought the preparations would take to much effort and time. What a joke."
64,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"One of the best kept secrets of the Leidseplein area! Great atmosphere and really terrific staff! Caroline took such good care of us that we came back several times! (""Sir"" says thank you again) The drinks are deliciously creative, like nothing you've every tasted! Add this place to your ""to-do"" list!"
65,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing cocktails-they‚Äôre pieces of art and delicious. Service with a smile and great ambiance.
66,NJOY Cocktailbar, 1 star ,4 years ago,"As tourists we were recommended this place from a friend who lives in Amsterdam. She said it was ""a bit pricey"". OMG. We did not expect to pay ‚Ç¨34 for 2 margaritas. ‚Ä¶"
67,NJOY Cocktailbar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Service slow and forgetting things. Cocktail menu nice but my old fashioned was rather watery. They ran out of many of the food options. More than 15 euro per cocktail seems a little much given this.
68,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful place! Very good service, place looks super nice and had the best cocktail ever(something with forest fruits- never tasted something that good). I recommend! It‚Äôs not that touristic place although it‚Äôs in a touristic area."
69,NJOY Cocktailbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came here on a Friday night extremely busy but worth the wait. High high end cocktails and you can even ask the bar just to make 1 up with your spirit/taste.
70,NJOY Cocktailbar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice cocktails, but pretty expensive for what you get. The drinks were nice, but had nothing too special either. The interior is pretty cosy though, and the service is good."
