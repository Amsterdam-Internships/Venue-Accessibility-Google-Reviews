2,Simpel, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Absolutely fantastic restaurant! Great service, lovely decor, absolutely amazing food. I had the prawn bisque and the chuck steak. Loads of flavour. I will definitely be back. Reasonably priced too."
3,Simpel, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Beware of this one. I suspect earlier reviews were about another restaurant altogether. Uninspired food of below average quality (dry tuna, sad soppy supposedly roasted vegetables, undercooked chips), some of it actually badly tasting …"
4,Simpel, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"The food was simply delicious. I ordered Confit De Canard, and I can say this is the best duck confit I've ever had.
The only problem is the restaurant has a small space, including their sitting arrangement. The table was really small."
