10,Narbonne, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Truly amazing food, but the owner is quite racist, and favour people from Netherland. If you're an English speaker, only go to Narbonne if you have a lot of time ahead of you  because you're gonna wait for a while. The experience is still worth it though, which shows how great the food is!"
