0,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We visited on a Thursday evening after  having drinks below. It was fully booked on the outside deck, so we sat inside. But the table we got was right next to the large window, so it was like we were sitting outside! The teriyaki salmon was …"
1,Bar Tolhuistuin, 1 star ,4 months ago,"We wanted to eat in the Tolhuistuin restaurant, but there were no free table when we got there so we were seated in the 'bar' area for about two hours. We wanted to order tapas, but we were not allowed to do so in that area of the …"
2,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Atmosphere is definitely unique : spacious restaurant area in intimate lighting, plants wall ; outdoor seating relax and more of a sunny sunday feeling ; bar is cosy and classy, with area for live music. There is an elevator to access the restaurant (otherwise main door is reachable by outside stairs)"
3,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Very cozy.. esp during summer. If you by chance taking a stroll around A’dam centraal station. Try hop on the ferry to north. Once you stepped out of the bar, it’s only a few steps away. The food is okay nothing special"
4,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,An ideal spot for enjoying a beer and appreciating the sunset over Amsterdam's beautiful canals. An excellent concert venue provides the perfect incentive for taking a ferry to this centrally located spot just minutes away from the Damplein.
5,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Perfect spot for some snacks and beer at sunset, easy to reach from Centraal Station just 5 minutes with ferry"
6,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We came here for a small live music event, a 12 - piece string/percussion/vocal ensemble. The setting was marvelous! It was a smaller room on an upper floor with great lighting, view, acoustics, ambience. There was a bar in the corridor …"
7,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great menu split over vegan, vegetarian, etc. And friendly service too."
8,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Huge place next to the ferry. The view is very nice and probably in the summer it's a great spot to relax. The menu has lots of local touches which is nice. Fluffy chocolate sprinkles with peanut butter is classic!
9,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,6 months ago,A nice spot outside just across the ij at station. In summertime they usually have music afternoons on Sunday. …
10,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Definitely one of the most cozy venues I've been to.  Fantastic environment, easy access from Amsterdam Central Station (with the free ferry), and an overall lovely experience. The venue itself is well ventilated, and you can pay for drinks …"
11,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Amazing terrace, spacious place. The food is good but small portions. Was very busy when I went resulting in a slow service. Wonderful views on the IJ."
12,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favorite place,a unique quiet park to sit & think, each beautiful tree has it’s information and history written to enrich your knowledge and know about if that’s your first time to see such beauty of nature.
Been to many times, and can’t wait to come back and stop by."
13,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really great acoustics and visibility all round. Very chilled vibe and you are able to get change for lockers, cloak room etc. Helpful staff also. I was fortunate enough to see the incredibly talented Sevdaliza there."
14,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice cozy place with a sweet view over 't IJ. Apple pie little bit overpriced for 5,70e for a small piece but the overall food is good! Staff is friendly. At night you have some good concerts every now and then and it's next to the ferry in Noord :)"
15,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere as the concert hall is cosy and not too big. Sound is great. Quite warm, next time putting on just a t-shirt ;)"
16,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Paradiso Noord. A nice club but the membership fee nonsense on top of the ticket price (typical for Paradiso), and having to pay separately even for the cloakroom and lockers are upsetting. Plus beer prices are a total rip off. Other than that it's a nice venue."
17,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place to have a beer and a bite. Great atmosphere, nice bar staff and great view."
18,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The interior is like a trip to a rich person's ski loft in the 60s. Amazing atmosphere, great DJs, and terrific cocktails."
19,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Interesting and rather a unique place in terms of the location as well as the building itself. The food is tasty and is served in small portions to share.  Lovely ambiance with fair price. Only the service could be a bit better. Interesting …
20,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing service and really good food. After stating that I am allergic to nuts they rushed to the kitchen and crossed-check what I could actually eat and gave me a special menu card. I would not have expected that. The food was just on point with some nice twists. Would definitely go again
21,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very interesting place for drinks and snacks. The cocktails and bar area overlooks the canal, which is a nice place to sit and unwind in the evening. We took a ferry from the Centraal Station and its right next to the dock. The food is …"
22,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was delicious, the staff was really nice and helpful. Because of the sharing concept they said the food doesn't arrive at the same time, because they just bring it out when it's done but that was absolutely no problem since the …"
23,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I ate here already two times. It is rather a unique place in terms of the location as well as the building it is at. The food is nice and served as small portions to share. The staff is good. Gonna go back again this weekend. :-)
24,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,7 months ago,What a great place to hang out.
25,Bar Tolhuistuin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good, tasty food. The restaurant has lots of tables and during evening hours mainly lit by candles. This makes reading the menu awkward. Shared dining is the idea and the menu offers cold and warm dishes. The warm dishes are sometimes …"
26,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place to eat, you order small dishes and have about 3 rounds of those. The small dishes aren't really small, it's enough for 2 people to get a good taste, so it's nice for sharing. The range is really wide, from Japanese to classical …"
27,Bar Tolhuistuin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice and spacious restaurant, it was quite busy at the time we visited. Cute and friendly waitress and the service was good for Amsterdam standards. Menu is what they call ‘tapas style’, in other words shared plates. …"
28,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A lovely place with lots of room. Service was fast for Dutch standards! Bottle of water on the table, great! We had 6 dishes in total - 4 were nice, 1 was ok and 1 was very bad. So overall pretty good. It's also fairly reasonably priced. We booked online super simple. If they had more flavor and better dishes would give it a 5."
29,Bar Tolhuistuin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The place looks nice but the food is expensive for the quality you get.

They serve tapas like dishes. We were told not to order much per order to not …"
30,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Very nice restaurant with novel concept and meals. The idea is that together everyone eats small dishes so you can try everything. The dishes are all out of the box and unique combinations. Best to go with a larger group so one can try everything.
31,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Only had a mint tea so I can speak of the ambience and not much more. Very spacious with excellent views on the Ij. Good spot if you want to work or have a work meeting. Does have a slight highway - rest stop - restaurant feel in some ways. But thankfully it's just different enough to make it a solid option for a drink and maybe more.
32,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This place honestly has the best service ever experienced in this city (which is usually rude and bad), they are all very friendly and know how to spot a client who needs attention immediately. They all have a sense of humor and most humbly …"
33,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great venue for concerts! The restaurant is also really nice, serving delightful small dishes. Lockers are a bit small and you loose an extra 2 euros if you want to get something out of your locker in the mean time."
34,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good food for the pricing. Just an explosion of different fine tastes. I had the vegetarian dumplings and the vegetarian curry of aubergine with potatoe and jasmin rice. One of the best curries I've tasted. It just melts in your mouth. Going for the dessert in a few minutes, curious to find out."
35,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good place to meet with friends, had super nice dinner served in an uncommon way!:) super tasty meals! Desserts are also awesome! And of course beer and stronger stuff! Absolutely recommended! :)"
36,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place to have romantic dinner. Note: it's better to make a reservation because it's always full. There are some areas with sofas where you can sit down and have a beer with a friend or partner.
37,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food at a very good price. The whole setting is amazing, check out the vintage interior and cocktail bar in the back. I will definitely visit this place again if I'm in Amsterdam."
38,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is THE BEST! The atmosphere is great, I always enjoy eating at Tolhuistuin. The only thing I'd like to share is that I don't agree with their explanation on how to order. Before you order they explain how it works: The dishes are …"
39,Bar Tolhuistuin, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Fantastic food and a really enjoyable atmosphere to spend an evening in. However, I am not sure if it is just a result of it being always very busy but I find the service to be poor. Takes a long time to get staff attention and when you do you find out that particular waiter only takes drink or food orders not both, for example."
40,Bar Tolhuistuin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Location was great, scenery good but feel cheated but some of the staff. Got an ass juice that was off... Cloudy and tasted horrible. It was returned but no replacement or refund was offered. After doing several times finally a replacement …"
41,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing concert venue! The small room feels very homely and gives room for everyone to be able to see the stage. When trying to hang our coats there was no staff present, which was a bit of a bummer. But overall a cozy place that hosts good artists."
42,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tom Kah Kai soup was so delicious. Definitely a must have!!
Beautiful location with a view and sunny terrace.
It's normally very busy so I'd recommend making a reservation just to be sure!"
43,Bar Tolhuistuin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"They don't accept cash here so I hate it on principle!
Apart from the general inability to actually provide good service that is so prevalent in 'hip and trendy Amsterdam' sphere that this place exudes, limiting …"
44,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Would've gave it 5 stars if the service wasn't so slow, although it wasn't crowded initially. Tried the vegetarian plate for 2 and it was delicious. Careful on the olive tapenade, might have some leftover olive kernels."
45,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great cafe & bar. Very nice vibe and service. Clean toilets (free). Sign says only credit cards (no cash). Menu in Dutch but waiters can help (i used Google translate).
46,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Fantastic food served quickly by friendly staff. Portions are small but did not break the bank. We filled up and spent the same as we had the previous day at a disappointing burger place near centraal.
We will probably go back again tomorrow!"
47,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is great value for money! Food is surprisingly delicious! They have a sharing concept and they change the menue every month or so. Super nice view to the river.
48,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Restaurant is conveniently located very close to AMS Centraal station and also to a performance center with a stage where live performances can be enjoyed alongwith a few drinks and some bites. Good to spend time with music, food and dinner …"
49,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I love this place. You can get shared food, and it’s really nice to sit outside in the summer across from the IJ enjoying the views. You can go for drinks. You can find a concert and go for an evening out. They also have club nights, so if …"
50,Bar Tolhuistuin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, nice open interior, staff could be more attentive. We were left waiting after being seated, needed to ask for service ourselves after half an hour. Some items were forgotten as well. Still would probably go back."
51,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Interesting place with small portions to share. We were lucky to get a table because for the dinner almoust every table was booked. There is enough space for a baby stroller and lift to come in:)
52,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice views of amsterdam, so don't let the fact that it's across the bay put you off, the ferry is free and the tram service in amsterdam make it very easy to get too. The bar is a bit pricey, but the atmosphere is very relaxed if you can get a seat."
53,Bar Tolhuistuin, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Location great. Nice helpful staff. The menu ""not so"": the non-spanish-tapas-concept looks inviting but looking at the menu I don't really see thing that I can combine. Would be nice to see some side dish type of option. And no, I don't …"
54,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great medium size music venue, easily accessed by the free ferry from central station to the Eye. Lots of good gigs and club nights. Also has a nice restaurant with large terrace."
55,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Just take the free ferry across the water at the back side of Amsterdam Central Station. You will reach this balcony restaurant 75m from the jetty. Shared dining with nice little meals.
56,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice place with a good view on Amsterdam Ei. Easily accessible from Central Station by ferry. Has some small venues for beers and small plates with terrasses by the water with a great ambience! Also a theatre with almost daily performances
57,Bar Tolhuistuin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I went there for a new years party. This is a great venue with lots of space. There were 5 areas with different musical genres. They have an outside area which is pretty large which allowed us to see the fireworks being setoff in the city. …
58,Bar Tolhuistuin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nu e combo of bar, restaurant and concert hall. Haven't eaten there yet, but visited the terrace for a couple of beers before visiting there for a concert. One of the concert halls is a bit weird, as it is completely white from top to …"
59,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great fro drinks after work. Amazing space and view. Tapas menu is ok, but nothing exciting. I'd go more for drinks as couple or with friends."
60,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is great, there's plenty to choose from. Food is served quickly and it all tastes super fresh. Nice wine selection too."
61,Bar Tolhuistuin, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Don't expect too much ! my husband and I have booked a new year package - a dinner and a club afterwards. ... the dinner was extended to 4 hours and consisted of never ending appetizers. .. which were like a never ending foreplay of tiny …
62,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Large retro styled restaurant with a eclectic menu full of surprises and full of misfits, offering enough choices to make all visitors happy. Wether you are attracted by the chicken satay with garlic popcorn (yes, you read that right) or …"
63,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best and liveliest places in Amsterdam. Right near the river. Great salsa and nachos. Not so cheap but value for money for such a location on a sunny day.

66,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Cool 'tapas' concept for diner (not the Spanish style!). Pieces of art on your plate. Really creative dishes yet really tasteful. Great atmosphere, really surprising on the inside."
67,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This venue is an excellent place if you want to meet up with friends have a casual meal or a few drinks - be aware that service does varying quality based on how busy it is at certain times of day may find it a little bit slow

82,Bar Tolhuistuin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Just a few minutes by boat from the city center. Good food, meant for sharing. However the building itself is ugly and the second hand chairs are uncomfortable: it's a hipster place..."
83,Bar Tolhuistuin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"If you're visiting this place for a concert or a music performance:
I visited this place for a concert in the second floor.
The room is relatively small and if it gets crowded, it's really hard to breathe …"

86,Bar Tolhuistuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amsterdam is awesome! When I visit somewhere I like to breath the place, and there's no batter way to do this like in a bike! Rent a bike in Amsterdam is a big deal to discover all that the city can give to you."

Good meal, good wine and good athmosphere"
97,Bar Tolhuistuin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Went to the Toyland Amsterdam Spook event 2017, thought the event was bit a flat, I was expecting more from the build up and ticket price. The best bit was the cinema room and popcorn being handed out."

111,Bar Tolhuistuin, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Heavily overpriced - service like a canteen - just a safe place to eat: The Tolhuistuin offers reasonable food but its much too overpriced. The only reason to cross the Amstel and stay here is safety. The other side of the inner city is the …
