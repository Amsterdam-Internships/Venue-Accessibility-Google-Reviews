0,Butchers Tears, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice beer but shockingly overpriced food. We ordered 2 portions of frites and aside from being â‚¬12 (?!!!?), it was very small, wrapped in paper like a cheap takeaway and not particularly nice. It also arrived as one portion which looked like a normal to small size and when we queried we were told it was both portions!"
1,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A lovely open setting serving some of the most fun, delicious beers that I have tasted. The smoked farmhouse ale was a delight! I would definitely recommend that any beer lover should spend an afternoon sampling all that they have to offer"
2,Butchers Tears, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really interesting hole in the wall. Unique set up & decor. Staff is distant, but the beer is good. Food truck out front. Strange musical performance."
3,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,a year ago,Guys made a great job brewing a tasty beer. Donâ€™t forget - there is no food there - you have to bring/order yours (Thuisbezorgd helps).
4,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best beer in a family atmosphere. For craft beer junkies a must visit.
5,Butchers Tears, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Nice space but don't expect to be drinking 6 month old bottles of IPA in a brewery :(
6,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,5 months ago,An old butcher revamped into a hip bar where they serve great beers
7,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Unique place, with amazing beers! Start with Green Cap, and go crazy from there."
8,Butchers Tears, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The beers are just okay but lacking depth, but good value for money. The space is nice, they have a room at the back for concerts. It's at a bit of an odd location but still easy to get to with public transport. The space is nice very nice with long communal tables."
9,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A really amazing tap room and brewery with plenty of awesome punk/metal themed beers. They play some great music and are host to live bands. Got a chance to meet the brewer and he seems like a great guy. I wish them all the best.
10,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Beautiful place, a hidden gem. Great beer, some snacks, and a hip atmosphere."
11,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great for enjoying craft brews in the sun in spring/summer. The minimalist decor inside is also nice, resembling a butcher's shop. You're welcome to order pizzas, as only a few snacks are offered at the brewpub. â€¦"
12,Butchers Tears, 4 stars ,6 years ago,cool place to hang out. Pretty decent beers - definitely some of the best of the new range of micro breweries in Amsterdam. â€¦
13,Butchers Tears, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Butchers tears make some good beer, but sometimes there's consistency problems. The tasting room is a little out of the way but it's a cool experience! Unique setting and artwork, free bread and oil, and a solid selection of house beer."
14,Butchers Tears, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The advice was right. If you think you're in the wrong place then you're nearby. Urban, rustic feel. The third door I tried was the right one!  Like a damp old shed out back. Make no mistake though....they brew beer here. And the beer is â€¦"
15,Butchers Tears, 4 stars ,4 years ago,I didn't like a lot of the beers I tried here but then I am not a big beer drinker. I could still tell they were good partially because everyone around me was really enjoying theirs. Everyone that works here seems to have the same weird taste in what I could only describe as industrial techno.
16,Butchers Tears, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place and good craft beers. Occasionally a location for small concerts. The bar, situated in a very quiet street, looks like an empty butcher's shop (hence the name). Interesting concept."
17,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great unique delicious place with awesome atmosphere (for a butcher/school kind of design). But overall the beer is worth coming for, really good and it works, Iâ€™m a little tipsy."
18,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Hidden gem in Zuid! They brew different biers that change from time to time. Nice atmosphere with hip crowd. It counts with a sort of patio. Alternative rock concerts are also hosted sometimes there.
19,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A hidden gem in Amsterdam. Nondescript place from the outside, interior looks like an old parking lot (probably because it actually was). Serves good beer, at very reasonable prices. Nice outside terrace in the summer."
20,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"5 stars all damn day! Small batch brewery, family friendly, great brews, there are small snacks available- bread, nuts,  warehouse location with a Hipster feel, felt like some of the breweries back in the states, don't miss this spot."
21,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Perfect beer! A chill place to hang out with your friends. Not the best place for a date, tho... but you always could find a restaurant for this. For a small beer pub â€” just perfect. *Low tourists rate))))"
22,Butchers Tears, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"IPA and more IPA at this home brewery, converted from a service garage in the Stadionbuurt. The service is very slow, but people don't seem to mind the 20-25 minutes queuing, waiting for the one guy serving beer, punching the order into a â€¦"
23,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A Great quite place hidden behind a tram station. Their craft beers are all outstanding. It's never too busy there, even on a Friday afternoon"
24,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"great location, great beers, great service."
25,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good beer, good music, very gezellig - but hard to get to! You can't get there from Havenstraat even though you can see it from Kilo or Mevius; instead, you have to walk all the way back east and then down to Karperweg."
26,Butchers Tears, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"For craft lovers
Ignore the plastic chairs and revel in the purity of a great craft beer"
27,Butchers Tears, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice beer at a really good price, but the bar is basically just a bare room with some chairs. Worth a stop if you are in the area, not really worth a trip to hang out there though"
28,Butchers Tears, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great beer, great staff, just needs to be a little bigger.
But
Really worth going to and spending a night there."
29,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Amazing spot where they brew their own beer. Interior design is very sharp and the crew is very helpful and friendly.
30,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, unique. They've extended their bottle selection lately, which is awesome really."
31,Butchers Tears, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It is a pretty brewery with great beers, but, they sell a horrible t-shirt. Designer has to be fired right now !!"
32,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Because it is so unexpected and the beers are great this definitely deserves a five star rating. Awesome for kicking back and enjoying quality beers.
33,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly and nice craft beer place hidden away from the tourist crowds.

40,Butchers Tears, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Relaxed atmosphere, beers are pretty good and not too expensive."
41,Butchers Tears, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Well that's quite a hidden secret out there. Plenty of choice, all their own brewings."
