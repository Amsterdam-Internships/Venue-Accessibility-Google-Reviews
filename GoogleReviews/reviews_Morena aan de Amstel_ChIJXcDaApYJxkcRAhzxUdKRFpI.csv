8,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It's a little Greek restaurant with delicious food.  I had gyros with pita (which the waitress said was hand cooked) and I definitely recommend it. The staff is super friendly.
9,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"After a long day of walking around as a traveler, I was starving and didn't want to eat chain food.

11,Morena aan de Amstel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice staff, but the food is just 'okay'. The phyllo has a strange taste because of the oil or grease they use."

Food is good and reasonably priced ‚Ä¶"

16,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"As a Greek I‚Äôm very difficult client in Greek restaurants in Amsterdam all my thoughts I believe they don‚Äôt excist , so Morena makes really the difference serving original flavour Greek souvlaki or pita gyros , try to get your food and yo ‚Ä¶"

20,Morena aan de Amstel, 1 star ,a year ago,"Incredibly disappointed, their quality definitely hit a new all time low. The gyros tasted incredibly dry and barely with any flavor- the only fresh thing on the plate were the tomatoes."

28,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,a year ago,Many times the best food is not found in fancy restaurants but in small genuine places like this gem. ‚Ä¶
29,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We were struggling to find somewhere to eat, and I saw this place pop up on trip advisor. My partner lives Greek food so we decided to give it a try. It is small, only 5 or so tables, but that makes it cost, and you are right near the food ‚Ä¶"
30,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Excellent, best Greek souvlaki and Spanakopita in Amsterdam, even better than many places in Greece too."
31,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Just great food. A very few times you stumble over a really good place. This is one of the few places. The dishes are very good.

32,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Amazing Greek food and friendly service! It was delicious and we will definitely go again!
33,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Morena is the closest thing to the world ""home"" in Amsterdam. The food is like my mom's and whats better than that? The owner and the staff are kind and lovely and i am feeling so much better everytime i am going there. The meat, the ‚Ä¶"

Definitely going back again!!"
36,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Delicious dishes to a good price. Recommended.
37,Morena aan de Amstel, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Is a small Greek restaurant. Staff is friendly and serves you well.  You can eat the famous gyros and other things typically Greek. The space is still a bit ""old"" and could be a renovated or improved."
38,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Loooove this place.
My favourite Greek place in Amsterdam
üíìüôèüèº"
39,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It‚Äôs a shame you can‚Äôt give a higher score then 5/5, best Greek food you will find anywhere outside of Greece. The most kind owners, amazing food and overall great experience. If visiting amsterdam, it would be a crime to not visit this place!"
40,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Nice. Authentic and delicious
41,Morena aan de Amstel, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I have visited the place twice. First time there was a rude (Greek male) cook that served a ""decomposed"" version of souvlaki (Jesus Christ), quantity was little and the chicken was raw inside. The specific cook should be fired. Second time ‚Ä¶"
42,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious gyros and halloumi pitas for just ‚Ç¨6. Also, amazing, friendly and funny staff truly doing it with love. Even gave us to taste some ingredients when we were not sure what to order. Keep it up!"
43,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food here is very affordable and the menu is extensive with specialties from Southern Italy. We met the owner Roberto who'd converted the former pub into the town's most popular restaurant. He's done a great job on the place and the locals reward his investment with bums on seats.
44,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is tiny and quaint and the staff are SO FRIENDLY AND NICE! The food is delicious and served hot and quick. I definitely recommend the gyros and fries - omg the fries! The whole experience was so incredible we came back two days later for more üòç
45,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my absolute favorites in the city. You'll get a very generous portion for cheap, the food is super tasty, the atmosphere is cozy and the people working here are wonderful. I always go for the halloumi pita as it comes with fries ‚Äì so delicious! Nice location by the canal and close to Waterlooplein market. A true gem!"
46,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good food and extraordinary staff. I really like their gyros and chicken grill. Only thing they are missing is the variety of mezes. They should have at least 5 different kinds so people can enjoy a side dish with the food as well.

50,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Got introduced to this place by a very proud Greek friend of mine. He believes their gyros are better than anything in Greece. I have also tried souvlaki and baclava and it is divine. The lovely friendly service just adds to the experience. Tiny place, probably sell more takeout and you cannot reserve"

56,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place gives you a warm fuzzy feeling, great food and a staff that makes you feel right at home. Their pita gyros sized and worth the price, but most importantly you can taste the freshness as it's made from scratch every morning. ‚Ä¶"
57,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,very nice food.... very tasty
58,Morena aan de Amstel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Such a hidden gem! Best meal I've had (I had pork pita). And for  being so close to the main tourist part of amsterdam, it's so so well priced! Very inexpensive and I highly recommend"

Thank you Morena!"
68,Morena aan de Amstel, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Watch out! The owner has changed but the old reviews are still there. Now prices are higher and food is worse. Vegetables don't have taste and the meat is way too salt. It is a pity, because this used to be one of my favorite places."
