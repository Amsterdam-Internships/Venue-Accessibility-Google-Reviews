1,India Roti Room, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Small portions, my vegetarian meal felt like a starter. Unfriendly staff. My plate was dirty. The side salad was like plastic. Charged me 20% on top of the price in the menu because I have ordered at the bar but ate on a table, they said. ‚Ä¶"

8,India Roti Room, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious food and good service!!!
9,India Roti Room, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Really good food. Nice clean place. Prices are normal for an Amsterdam restaurant. We would have liked to receive the food a bit quicker but we were there with small kids, they don't last very long in restaurants."
10,India Roti Room, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Mediocre food and bad service, ordered butter chicken delivery with rice. The rice was not included so I called the place, they promised to deliver rice in 5-10 minutes. After 15 minutes food was getting cold and still no rice. So I called again. They apologize and say the delivery guy will bring it in another 20 minutes."
11,India Roti Room, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Undercooked pink and greasy chicken, clumpy rice and doughy thick naan bread. All a shame because the base balti sauce was not so bad. I‚Äôve had a lot of Indian food throughout the world and this place is extraordinarily poor."
12,India Roti Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food, been here 2 times and enjoyed it. Definitely coming back. They also arranged a birthday cake upon my request and it was right on time and with good presentation."

14,India Roti Room, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Mediocre for this kind of restaurants : Ok food, ok service and ok place. Nothing extraordinary and it was not that homey and friendly, not sure what the other reviews were talking about cause I definitely had a different experience. Location is not the best either."
15,India Roti Room, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It's ok if you're in the neighborhood. Tandoori chicken didn't taste like it was freshly made, more like reheated. Biryani chicken was a better choice."
16,India Roti Room, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food & service. Prices are quite high depending on wallets but worth it as the dishes are delicious.
17,India Roti Room, 1 star ,2 years ago,Horrible service. They let us book a table and when we arrive it says It is full. After telling us they person in charge leaves without even offering any solution to that  Will never come back and I recommend no one to get that horrible service
