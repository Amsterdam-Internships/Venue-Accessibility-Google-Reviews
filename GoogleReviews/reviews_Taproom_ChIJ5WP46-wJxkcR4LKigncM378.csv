0,Taproom, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is Legit!! Great selection of beers and good food.. the staff here is friendly and educated in coin and interested things for tourist. Shout out to our bartender Ruben!! Thanks for the friendly hospitality and great conversation!!  Definitely recommend this place.
1,Taproom, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is awesome. Massive range of local craft beers and international too. Great tastings and the staff are super friendly
2,Taproom, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic variety of local beer. Went there for one and couldn't bring ourselves to leave for a couple of hours. Excellent staff kindly shared their knowledge of the beers and allowed us to try them. They even have phone charging safes which came in very handy.
3,Taproom, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Friendly staff, all food freshly made you can see the chef if you sit inside. Amazing selection of beers from around the world 24 in total including there own brew from their microbrewery which we tried and was very nice. ‚Ä¶"
4,Taproom, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"THE TAPROOM.

They just get it: you are there for the beer, so they have a few interesting ‚Ä¶"
5,Taproom, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Easy to miss this spot, near the museum district but not quite in it. Great beers, mostly Dutch, and a short but good food menu, in a small but cozy room. And it's on a canal, so grab the table by the window, if available."
6,Taproom, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is in the of all the beer places in Amsterdam, visited for the first time. Was a bit disappointed, more Tha 50% off the beer selection was not available and the food is very expensive (contrary to the prices on there website)"
7,Taproom, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Superb place!
- Prime location
- Excellent craft beer ‚Ä¶"
8,Taproom, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I really like this place. They have  great selection of beers and the food is great here too. I really like the flammkuchen here and they also have ciders (Old Mout for sure)
9,Taproom, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A fair selection of local beers, and sometimes a presentation from local breweries too. There's some food too - I only had fries (which were quite good), but there's also some burgers, couple of salads, some flammkuchen options and some bar ‚Ä¶"
10,Taproom, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This bar is superb! So much so we spent two afternoons (3pm-6pm) sitting in the sun enjoying a beer whilst people watching and catching all the sun. The staff were all friendly, up for a laugh and gave great service keeping your glass full. The Pizzas and Chips with Mayo were really tasty. Definitely worth a visit!"
11,Taproom, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Thanks for the tap water, amazing chicken wings, that Dutch snack with meat in it and good service (not too persistent, but attentive enough). This establishment has quite cozy atmosphere to it. Definitely will revisit it with my friends. The only con is that there wasn‚Äôt any Amstel beerüòÖ"
12,Taproom, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Never wrote a review before - but had to, as to warn others off this place. Can‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs got good reviews. Waitress came over and was like ‚Äúwhat do you want‚Äù as we sat down... ‚Äú menu of  beers would be great please‚Äù ... her ‚Ä¶"
13,Taproom, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A great find. Good service, great beers with 24 on tsp and very reasonable prices. I tried the nachos and was pleased. Other snacks are iavailable as well as a selection of hamburgers. ‚Ä¶"
14,Taproom, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome Blonde on draft and great outside seating area for some legit people watching, given the tourist-area that this place is located. We didn't want to wait in line for the Heineken Experience so we just kept walking and ended up here - I think we actually won given the great beer, great service, and awesome spot to sit."
15,Taproom, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice bearbar with very friendly staff in central location. We got lost for a few hours
16,Taproom, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Not sure why this place has such a good rating. Pretty boring place: small, rudimentary and the beer selection is like any other bar in Amsterdam. Music was too loud without any obvious reason (there was not a party going on, just people at the tables talking)."
17,Taproom, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent beer variety, Good staff, good ambient."
18,Taproom, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great pizza and wings. Service was solid and met our needs. Menu is a little limited but there‚Äôs a large beer and alcohol selection if you plan on hanging out.
19,Taproom, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good selection of beers. Food is decent too, limited menu. Service can be a little slow and the place is small."
20,Taproom, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely place to stop for a quick half (litre presumably because of the metrics). The guy at the bar was great for both reccomendations and background knowledge on the brews themselves. 10/10 would step out of the cold again.
21,Taproom, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great beer and light food. The food on wood option is fabulous. We had the oyster stout and the blogesen blond which are amazing. A short walk from the rijks museum, a must stop after seeing the rembrandt, van gogh and other Dutch masters."
22,Taproom, 1 star ,a year ago,It's no longer a craft beer bar. They have only 5 beers on tap. Mostly generic local beers. Not worth the visit.
23,Taproom, 2 stars ,3 years ago,This place claims to have tons of beers on tap but they were out of the one I wanted and didn‚Äôt have the larger list on the chalkboard that the menu suggested you reference. Seating was wobbly and crowded.
24,Taproom, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved this place, Quinn is a great bartender and plays the best music! We were walking down the street outside and decided to stop in bc of the music.
Very nice staff, will be back for sure"
25,Taproom, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had an excellent stop.  It is. Short walk from the Rijks Museum and has a fine selection of beer on tap.
26,Taproom, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic burgers! 9‚Ç¨ each. Cozy ambience and perfect for drinks and food after a visit of the Heineken museum.
27,Taproom, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great craft beer choice, good burgers, excellent fries and welcoming staff. Definitely a place to come back!"
28,Taproom, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Beer is good, but there's too much crime going on in the office. And Speaking of hygiene? Better don't."
29,Taproom, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great little spot with nice patio, great service and yummy pie. Open late which is nice. Great phone charger box too if you're phone is low."
30,Taproom, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The blue cheese burger I had was the best I ever had, it was an amazing experienceüòÄ ‚Ä¶"
31,Taproom, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good food (bitterballen, burgers and fries especially), great staff and terrific beer selection. Right off two tram lines and only a short walk from the Museumplein."
32,Taproom, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, with twenty some beers on tap. However, they were out of my first four choices. Little disappointing."
33,Taproom, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Une adresse exceptionnelle ! THE BEST PLACE TO EAT AND Drink! All is perfect. Burgers and the special French fries. My special and favorite place
34,Taproom, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Wide selection of beers, but prices are also high... Tiny place, often packed. Close to the metro station (30 meters)!"
35,Taproom, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Many beers on tap, space outside in the sun. Really good spot for an after-work drink. Maybe not the greatest choice of food, but it's still ok."
36,Taproom, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Fantastic selection. Friendly place.
37,Taproom, 2 stars ,2 years ago,They don‚Äôt sell burgers anymore and service is awful. Waitress is really unpleasant.
