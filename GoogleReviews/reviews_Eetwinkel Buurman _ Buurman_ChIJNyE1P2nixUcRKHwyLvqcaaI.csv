0,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Unfortunately pizza is not true pizza.
The dough is far from pizza dough not even sure what kind of type is that neapolitana? New York? no idea‚Ä¶Ingredients are not the best either. Good place to grab ‚Ä¶"
1,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Relaxed, casual and very friendly staff & owners. Not much space, reserve or order take away.
Pizza was exquisite! Thin dough, very tasty with fresh ingredients! Came from the Pijp by bike to taste it."
2,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly atmosphere.  Order the pizza with ginger tea.  Pizza is delicious.  Seating outside was a bit close to each other back to back.  Staff was great!
3,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice tasty and not pricey pizzas in a very casual environment.

5,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Love this pizza place. Little hidden gem behind Erasmus park. Not your ordinary pizza and really nice if you want to try something different from the usual pizza style.
6,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favourite restaurant in the West. Apart from a great pizza and kind service, the location has an amazing atmosphere, both in the fresh and quiet terrace by the park + canal and inside, with the random decoration and nice music."
7,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 2 stars ,7 months ago,COLD PIZZA. This place is only good for the location and drinks. The pizza is cold and very strange. Every pizza should be 10 euro given the quality. If you want good pizza go to Mangia or Mangiancora. The location is great but the pizza is very average.
8,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"So glad we took the recommendation of our Airbnb host and tried this place. Diverse selection of craft beer (and liquor) with seasonal rotations on tap along with INCREDIBLE F*****G PIZZA. Get anything with the ""raindrop"" peppers on it and thank me later. Friendly service as well!"
9,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great pizza with gorgonzola (Ruben is the name I guess). Friendly staff. It is a small place but we could find a place to sit. It is near my house so it is very practical.
10,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Highly recommend this restaurant. Nice pizza, nice service, nice view as well. Impressed so much."
11,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool little bar and pizzeria - had a pizza oven at the back.
Friendly service and a cool vibe.
I had a Margherita with a bit of chorizo. Lovely."
12,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 1 star ,11 months ago,The pizza was delivered 30 minutes late and completely cold. I ordered a simple Margherita but all I could sence was frozen chunks of parmesan cheese. Horrible experience. Unfortunately this was not my first disappointment with them.
13,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,7 months ago,This is one of the best and coziest pizza places in Amsterdam. Enjoy it with a group of friends or your date
14,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great pizza place with a few really delicious options. We always get takeaway and call in advance because it can get quite busy. A few times however, we've asked for the walnuts to be removed from the Geit pizza due to allergies. They always say 'no problem' but it's always forgotten!"
15,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Lovely ramshackle little bar. Nice staff good music. Love at first site üòç
16,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I love grabbing a drink here in the early evenings. It‚Äôs so picturesque and the staff are great. Plus they have great special biers - as well as their own!

Be aware as last order for the kitchen is 10pm yet I think drinks are available !"
19,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 3 stars ,9 months ago,The food was good but they let us waiting so long while the other people that came after us got their food to go first than us (5 people) same 2 pizzas each of them.. I asked the reason and the guy was so rude..
20,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great pizza! Recommend the chilli one (pittig) and the Palma. Thin base and crispy crust.
21,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 1 star ,a year ago,"really confused by the reviews of this place. we ordered 2 pizzas via deliveroo last night and they were literally inedible... the margherita was excessive tomato paste spread on some kind of tortilla/wrap thing. (not actual pizza dough), ‚Ä¶"
22,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Just gonna say that this pizzeria was recommended to me by an Italian person and he was right and I can only say that the pizza was really good. The staff was super nice and professionals, which is extra nice during this corona times, recommended 100%"
23,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Great beer, great pizza and a cosy spot outside!"
24,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious, thin and crusty pizza. Very friendly staff. The place looks a bit alternative which I liked, it has a bar feeling and the pizza oven is more or less in the middle of the room. Totally recommend if you want a great pizza in a chilled atmosphere"
25,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,a month ago,An amazing cook and tasty pizzas!
26,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We live around the corner from here and feel lucky to be so! This is our favorite pizza place by far. The pizzas are thin, have creative toppings, are always exactly enough, and the staff is super nice. As regulars we can safely say that their quality is consistent!"
27,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best Pizza I have eaten in Amsterdam! Highly recommended!
28,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Best pizza we've had in a long time! Service was really average at first and glasses dirty but the pizzas were worth it. The main dude is super friendly and limoncello was tasty, cheers man :)"
29,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice pizzas and decent selection of draft beers. Right next to the park and a canal so sitting outside is quite ideal on a sunny day. Seating inside can get a little cramped but it's great that you essentially stand in the pizza kitchen with the cooks as the do their magic. Worth a stop if in the neighborhood.
30,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 1 star ,a year ago,Really bad and slow service. We have ordered pizza and waited for 40 min. Then when we asked about our order - waitress said that she didn't write it down. No apologies... nothing... The only good thing here was the pizza.
31,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best pizza's in Amsterdam. Have the parma!
32,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great (small) place for a quick bite among locals. With a select amount of tables outside and only a handful inside, this small 'restaurant' (aptly dubbed a 'foodshop') serves tremendous pizza's. Very thin crusts, crispy, fresh ingredients, not greasy at all. Nice Gin&Tonic's as well, and service with a smile. A personal favorite."
33,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"still worth the detour, people are friendly, the pizzas are tasty & original, but seemed to have evolved a bit towards flammkuchen compared to 5years ago. On Sundays, best to reserve a spot"
34,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious, very rich pizzas. Purists might not like the high amount of ingredients that each pizza includes but the result is extraordinary. The restaurant has a very cosy feel with an outdoor area that is ideal for sunny days."
35,Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Really disappointed, really expensive for the quality. I am still looking for the cheese and my friend who's ask for no chorizo has a dubble ration. We waited ages for our pizzas and when I went inside I understood why. The kitchen crew is ‚Ä¶"
