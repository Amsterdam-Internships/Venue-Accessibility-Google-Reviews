1,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food and customer service. It‚Äôs located so close to the Amsterdam Centraal Station so we had our last lunch there in Amsterdam before taking the train back home. Their Ayam Kremes & Ayam Woku tasted authentic.

17,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"We really like it. We had the multi-dish (non-vegan) option and every single dish was delicious. My favorite dishes were the satay chicken and the spicy beef - if we go back to Amsterdam I will get one of those alone. Our host, Gery ‚Ä¶"

22,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"If not for the wait to find a table, which was already free and had to be cleaned to accommodate me, the restaurant is really good for food. It's good for a fixed menu option, if you're going for ala carte, you're not going to have as many ‚Ä¶"

Heavenly food! Must try when coming to Amsterdam. It's a selection of 10 dishes or so. Their rice cakes with the peanut butter sauce are to die for. Totally recommended"
25,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious Indonesian cuisine, but not as spicy as I expected. There are vegetarian options available. The service is efficient and friendly enough, but do come early for lunch because it seems that there is always a queue."
26,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Rijsttafel! Rijsttafel! Rijsttafel! I've never had Indonesian food before, but what we got was SO delicious.

31,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Never had a rice table meal so decided to try it here. It was great, except a little too spicy for my husband so he limited himself to the non-spicy stuff. We gave everything a try and I loved all the flavors. Staff was welcoming and ‚Ä¶"
32,Aneka Rasa, 3 stars ,6 months ago,The recommendations for this restaurant were appealing but it was closed when we arrived.  Too bad...they're supposed to be the best Indonesian restaurant in Amsterdam.
33,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Definitely would dine here again. Excellent food!
34,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Tried the ayam rujak and it was super tasty! Great service too, and they have amazing deals now!"
35,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I came here to eat with a couple of friends because we needed to wind down after a hard day's work. We fancied a rice table and picked this one because it was so close to central station and easy to meet everyone. We ordered the vegetarian ‚Ä¶
36,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a great hidden gem in Amsterdam! The set meal was fantastic and included so many different options to try. I came as a single and although the menu is for two people they catered for me brilliantly by just sending out a single portion ‚Ä¶
37,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Situated centrally. Very friendly, multilingual, unobtrusive staff, excellent service.

42,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious, tasty Indonesian food!!! Similar to Malaysian cuisine. They prefer reservations but walking in you may have to wait a bit. 2 menus vegetarian or non vegetarian served tapas style. We got non vegetarian. Various meats & veggies ‚Ä¶"
43,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Indonesian restaurant with a simple and comfortable atmosphere. The food tastes great.
44,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was excellent. The only item that kept this from being a 5 star review was the amount of staff on shift. There were 2 girls running the entire restaurant, who did a great job, but the owner needs more members on the team to take care of the amount of customers. My wife loved the variety of food offered with our order."
45,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Incredible !!
The chef reminds our names and the dishes are d√©licious.. a service so kind and delicate !! A very beautiful exp√©rience"
46,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious! I grew up on Indonesian food and this was great. Their specialty is Rijsttafel, essentially a Tour of Indonesian Food. If you have never had Indonesian food, this is the place to try it. Indonesian food is along the lines of Thai ‚Ä¶"
47,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Can not recommend this place enough. We had to wait half an hour for a table (we were a party of nine so not a big issue at all). But as the place was so busy that was a good sign. We ordered the rice table, there was a perfect amount of ‚Ä¶"
48,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The restaurant was quiet was we went just after opening. The waiter was very good, polite and more than happy to explain the food we were ordering as we had never eaten it before. The food arrived quickly and was genuenly amazing, I just wish there was more."
49,Aneka Rasa, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food quality of the Rice taffle was underwhelming for 20 euros. Service was also just OK, had to ask the waiter two times for my drink since she forgot the order, and two times for the bill since she forgot. ‚Ä¶"
50,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great indo food. Good portion. So full of flavour
51,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,a year ago,"They provide different dishes, coming in small portions. Two options, vegetarian and non vegetarian were on the menu. We went for the non vegetarian one and it was really delicious. Also the dessert is included in the menu."
52,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food. Fantastic variety of dishes for a reasonable price.
Service was a bit patchy but not terrible: we had quite a wait for the bill and again to actually pay but the staff were very friendly and wrll-informed about the menu."
53,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favourite restaurants for Indonesian food.  For 20 EUR each you'll get a good spread of dishes on the set menu. Very central, friendly service."

55,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"As I'm writing this review, my stomach is grumbling early carving another helping of Aneka Rasa!  First, do not eat here alone, the portions are enormous; they could feed a group of three.  Next, try the ""Aneka"" platter it was scrumptious, ‚Ä¶"
56,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,An excellent assortment of Indonesian dishes that give a great sample of that country's culinary highlights. ‚Ä¶
57,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very good food and very nice people there ‚ò∫Ô∏è We'll visit again
58,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"This was my first experience of Indonesian food and I loved it!

If you're in the same situation, I strongly recommend this place as you can try ‚Ä¶"
59,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice spot in this dense area. The food was great and the tasting menus are amazing to try out different things that you know or don't know. The Aneka menu was the best, with so many different kinds of meat and sauce. The staff was very friendly and spoke English."
60,Aneka Rasa, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"The waitress's opening gambit of 'we're short staffed, service might not be good' didn't bode well. In the end service wasn't the problem. We had the Aneka Rice table. The food was just disappointing. The vegetable dishes were very bland. ‚Ä¶"
61,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If it's Indonesian food your after, this is the place.
Really good authentic food, pleasant surroundings and friendly people.
About ‚Ç¨21 per head. ‚Ä¶"
62,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This was an enjoyable evening meal; the food had great flavors but I found the spiciest dishes were a little under spiced for my taste. That said, we will be happy to return for another meal the next time we are in town."
63,Aneka Rasa, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We left this restaurant without eating because we were not allowed to order just appetizers. We were a group of four and two people wanted the set menu( a variety of small dishes) , and the other two wanted to order a couple of appetizers. ‚Ä¶"
64,Aneka Rasa, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Always looking for good indonesian food in Amsterdam. I ended up getting a Chicken Satay which was very good. For my main course I got some other chicken dish. It was decent, but nothing to write home about. The prices are also very high here."
65,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,10 years ago,"This wasn't my first neither the last time I was in this restaurant. The staff is really nice they speak English well and helpful. The food is tasty and the portions are big. They have Indonesian beer called ""Bitang"" which is a bit sweet compare to other lagers but I like it."
66,Aneka Rasa, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"OK rijsttafel, and slightly pricey at 29 euros for the more premium set menu. We came away feeling full, the food was satisfying, but not outstanding. I've had other rijsttafel in Amsterdam, some at similar price range, and this was not the best I've had."
67,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the food here, vegetarian rijstaffel is absolutely delicious!"
68,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We ordered the ""aneka"" rice table and it was good. However, the tastes always lingered on the sweeter note which I find it difficult when you want to put Indonesian platter. ‚Ä¶"
69,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great great food.  It was in our travel book by Rick Steve's.
70,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Two set menu options, meat and vegetarian, around 20 euros pp. Comes all at once in little dishes. Quite nice to try a bit if everything, and filling."
71,Aneka Rasa, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I was very excited to try this place. Unfortunately, this review will NOT tell you about the food. ‚Ä¶"
72,Aneka Rasa, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Just had diner over there. We had a combination of various dishes (you can't order anything else)  One spoiled dish, that can happen, but they took it back and the only thing they said was: do you want something else instead of that.... no ‚Ä¶"
73,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We ordered rice table and everything was tasting great. Service was a bit slow, we ate our food halfway and drinks were still not served.
After paying tge bill we went out for a walk around the neighbourhood before ‚Ä¶"
74,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I've never had rice table before because it's not available where I come from, so I don't have a compare it to, but I have been excited to try it and I thought it was fantastic. Also the staff were very friendly. Wonderful experience."
75,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We wanted to eat some Indonesian food, and this place offered a vegetarian rijstafel  plate for two. It was really tasty, and the atmosphere was really warm and cosy. I would definitely eat here again."
76,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you are cravings for Asian food, this is a must try. Had great time here. Food is awesome, service is great. Staff are very friendly. Environment is great.. They are doing a great job here.. keep it up!!"
77,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Visit this Indonesian restaurant every time I visit Amsterdam. Always good food and busy location, with reasonable pricing. Would recommend trying a Rijsttafel to try lots of different flavours"
78,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing food, both the taste and presentation.  Service was a bit slow (and very friendly) but it could have been that it was a fairly busy night in the restaurant."
79,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,a year ago,THE FOOD IS SOOO GOOD HERE!!! It‚Äôs a must go in my opinion. The staff is also very friendly. This place deserves more than 5 stars üëçüëçüëç
80,Aneka Rasa, 1 star ,6 years ago,"If you're asian or if you've ever had proper Indonesian food in Indonesia or want too in the future, avoid this place like the plague. Everything's watered down and flavours changed to what I can only guess is for ""local/western"" tastes. ‚Ä¶"
81,Aneka Rasa, 1 star ,4 years ago,Horrible tourist trap! The Reistafel has no distinct flavors at all. Worst one I ever had.  They served the 5 of us the same amount of food as for tables of 2 - but charged for 5!
82,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fabulous authentic Indonesian food, just as my mum and gran would cook it! Lovely friendly service and all for a great price."
83,Aneka Rasa, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I wish I could give more rating because the food was actually good. The service was so slow and although there were plenty tables available, we couldn't sit because no one was available to clear the tables. They seem to be short staffed and ‚Ä¶"
84,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We had the Aneka rijsttafel and it was one of the best meals we've ever had. The restaurant was comfy and the hosts could not have been more welcoming.
85,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Rice-table was excellent, everything tasty.  Too much to eat for 2 people.   Don't fill up on the chips and peanut sauce before the mail."
86,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We had a rice table. Two kinds of rice with many small meat, chicken and vegeterian dishes. Some of them were good. The others were ok. The service was great."
87,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really good food, super service and they definitely made me a regular. Especially in these hard times!"
88,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I should have rated this restaurant with 3 stars because of the totally unfriendly staff,but the food is tasty,and the atmosphere is cool...I generally aim to be generous and flexible with the feedbacks so everyone can work on themselves and become better by the ratings."
89,Aneka Rasa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very delicious and authentic food. After having  stayed many years in Malaysia, I can say the ricetable was perfect!"
90,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food was terrific and I loved the rice table which has a mix of their greatest hits. The location is next to the seedy Red Light Distric so keep that in mind if you are with children.
91,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,a year ago,Banging food for a very good price and lovely staff! Thanks guys for the deliciousness. Highly reccomend
92,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good food, perfect for sharing with friends. I think the portion sizes are huge, so make sure you go with an empty stomach"
93,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Amazing restaurant, lovely staff, ordered a rice table and loved it! The staff even gave us historical context into the restaurant. Really enjoyed the experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant"
94,Aneka Rasa, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Expensive and if you want rice table you have to order minimum for 2 people. Small quantities and not so friendly staff. Bit disappointed.
95,Aneka Rasa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent authentic Indonesian cuisine! This is a must place to go. Price is very reasonable.
96,Aneka Rasa, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Considering its very central touristic location and price the food was not too bad (we had rijsttafel) but I had better rijsttafels in many other indonesian restaurants in the Netherlands.
