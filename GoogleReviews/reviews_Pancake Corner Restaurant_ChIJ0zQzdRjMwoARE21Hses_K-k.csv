2,Pancake Corner Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Very friendly service. Pancakes ü•û were good but hash browns were a bit under seasoned. Not a big deal. My daughter had the chilaquiles and they were delicious. We will visit again.
3,Pancake Corner Restaurant, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"If you love home-like flavor, to favor local efforts, to go off the beaten path, this is one awesome little finding. Family owned. The owner is keeping an eye in details and quality and compliance control. ‚Ä¶"
4,Pancake Corner Restaurant, 2 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Old mom and pop style. They have outdoor patio.  Food is cheap but quality is not there.  Ordered waffle,  French toast, pancakes.  Maple syrup was far the worst. Absolutely zero tastes of maple just sugar and grease. Horrid maple syrup. Waffle tasted more like sour though bread because it was so dense."
5,Pancake Corner Restaurant, 1 star ,6 months ago,The parking is snug. The establishment itself is a bit suffocating not too many windows and if you claustrophobic good luck trying to enjoy your meal there. The food isn't all that great and the service is even worse! The last time I ‚Ä¶

16,Pancake Corner Restaurant, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The french toast was my favorite thing. I also had the breakfast sausage which was spicy and not the traditional sausage I was expecting. The buckwheat waffle was dense and crumbly. I would only reorder the french toast.

48,Pancake Corner Restaurant, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious food... friendly service
49,Pancake Corner Restaurant, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The food was bland. The food was pricey for the quality. Coffee tasted like it had been pressed through old socks. The country steak was fatty and the sauce in the chilaquiles needs work. I would have given it 1 üåü but the waitress was courteous. The place needs to be revamped. Buy new cups and plates. I don't recommend this place.

54,Pancake Corner Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I really like this place. We try to make it an weekly stop on the weekends. They have one of the best chilaquiles that I have tried. Their servers are always wearing a smile on their faces. Remember to be a little patient on the weekends for they do tend to get busy. Always worth the wait. ENJOY!
55,Pancake Corner Restaurant, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The wait time is horrible. Took half an hour to give me my food, and even then it was missing a lot of the items. Never ONCE got offered a refill. I found myself rationing my one cup of orange juice till the end. The place is also very ‚Ä¶"
56,Pancake Corner Restaurant, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Service is ok, as usual depends who you get as your waiter. Got here like at 10 am, got food after 10 minutes.
