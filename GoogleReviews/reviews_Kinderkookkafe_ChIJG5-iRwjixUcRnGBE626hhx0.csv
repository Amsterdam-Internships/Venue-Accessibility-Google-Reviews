0,Kinderkookkafe, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"We visited while on holiday a few years ago and our kids (4 and 6) really loved it. It has comfortable seating arrangements for the parents as well and it's a great place for kids to roam around, play as they please and prepare their own â€¦"

The owner / manager reached out and was able to settle based on the â€¦"
2,Kinderkookkafe, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Had a kid's birthday party there. Unfortunately the outside playground was mostly closed off still. There was a mistake with the booking, the starting time was registered wrongly, but the manager managed to call all personnel in the early morning and it could start only 30 mins too late. Good service"
3,Kinderkookkafe, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"So fun for the little ones, they can prepare their own food here ðŸ¥³"
4,Kinderkookkafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice experience for little kids

And yummy sandwiches for the parents â€¦"
5,Kinderkookkafe, 1 star ,2 years ago,"For a children cafe, it is amazing how unfriendly the staff can be. The whole idea is that the kids would be enabled to make their own food, but they could at least make the children feel welcome by giving them basic instructions as to what â€¦"
6,Kinderkookkafe, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Not what I expected.  Went for mommy daughters day to decorate cupcakes.  You get a ready made cupcake, choice of white or pink sugary paste and 5 ingredients same for everyone.  Very low quality.  My girls ages 5 and 7 were done in about 2 â€¦"
7,Kinderkookkafe, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Nice location and playground but the service is not great. Limited menu with no food options for lactose/dairy and meat free eaters (you can also not eat your own food there) as everything has cheese or meat. â€¦
8,Kinderkookkafe, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice location at the Vondelpark, near Overtoom. Reachable by tram or by bike. Car parking underneath Reade, center for rehabilitation.
Good idea, nice for kids parties, but if would be great if the kids could learn â€¦"
9,Kinderkookkafe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This translates to Kids Cook Cafe. For about 2-3euros, you can decorate your own cupcake, sandwiches, or make your own carrot/cucumber puzzle, pigs'n a blanket, or roll out and cut your own butter cookies. For the baked stuff, you make it, â€¦"
10,Kinderkookkafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Brilliant idea and lots of fun for kids. If you are looking for a place to have a coffee or tea while your kids can play, this is it. Also great for birthday parties or play dates. Great place to warmup after a walk in a cold winter day with your kids."
11,Kinderkookkafe, 5 stars ,5 years ago,A brilliant and unique experience for parents and younger kids/pre-teens. We were welcomed by the friendly and helpful Sandra and her young volunteer who walked us through the process: kids choose the dish they would like to prepare from a â€¦
12,Kinderkookkafe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a very nice place in a little corner on the Vondelpark. Good for little kids and bigger kids. We didn't find the staff there particularly engaging, seemed too busy amongst themselves to be bothered about customers. It's a trust â€¦"
13,Kinderkookkafe, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Very nice place for kids. Fun with cooking! They can choose from a selection of dishes, Warm food (like pizza), pastries, etc. Just for 10 minutes or up to say half an hour to keep your little ones busy. Pizzas will be heated and served! â€¦"
14,Kinderkookkafe, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The concept is fabulous, but the execution was lacking.  Perhaps I was there on a bad day, but I expected my kids to feel totally welcome there.  Instead, my wife and I were both shocked how distant and unwelcome we felt.  No one greated â€¦"
15,Kinderkookkafe, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Kids enjoyed preparing their own food (2 year old and 6 year old) . Nice idea for a cafe, with some fun play areas whilst you wait for the food to cook. Good parking for bikes. The idea needs a bit of refining to improve the experience."
16,Kinderkookkafe, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place for kids to hang out. There are several menu items they can make and a nice small play area outside. The staff was friendly and made sure we have every thing we needed. Had great fun, good food we made on our own, and a reasonable price"
17,Kinderkookkafe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I got to spend the morning here with my niece and nephew and they had a lot of fun. It is a great place for parents to drop their child by for a sing-a-long event or just to make something (pizza, cookies, etc.) with their children. Very close to Vondelpark, so if the sun is out you can go for a nice walk afterwards."
18,Kinderkookkafe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"there are some stairs to get in bit kids can also take the slide. We had a Birthday party celebration full of sugar and chocolate! Bake with your friends your own chocolate cake, Oatmeal cocobars and decorating spice bread houses... Magic â€¦"
