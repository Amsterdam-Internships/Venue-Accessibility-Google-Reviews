17,Susie's Saloon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A large selection of music, went from country and western, to classic dance, house music, well anything that is good. Really enjoyed my night there. If I remember rightly, it is a meeting place for hells angels, behind the bar there were cards from around the world, which was pretty cool."
18,Susie's Saloon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had two afternoons here whilst I was in Amsterdam recently.  We managed to get outside seating and the staff are friendly and the drinks are reasonably priced.  It doesn't smell weed but there is a really nice glassed off smoking room where you can roll and smoke away.  Great location close to Dam Square and the Red Light District.
19,Susie's Saloon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Had a few days here over the sevens weekend. Great food and service. Bar staff are awesome with beautiful views beside the canals. Heaps of local characters. Make sure you stop here for a pint, burger and a couple of cheeky smokes before hitting the red light district."

26,Susie's Saloon, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"A good place to have a pint of Heineken, which costs ‚Ç¨3 in the happy hour (from 14h to 18h and 22h to 0h). Good music, good decoration. The guy behind the counter was not very nice, though. And they charge ‚Ç¨0,50 if you wish to pay with a credit card, which is absurd."
27,Susie's Saloon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cheap drinks and nice music. Happy hours at 10:30 - 00:00. Warm people. Best place for me at Amsterdam. You can drink alcohol and smoke marijuana together at smoking area.

31,Susie's Saloon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A bit of a spit and sawdust bar, but outside they have seating overlooking the canal - quaint. For those looking for the alternative side of Amsterdam there is a screened of section you are allowed to 'smoke' in."
32,Susie's Saloon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I recently moved to Amsterdam and this has become my go to place for after work beers, for a nice breakfast on Saturdays and Sundays and to meet up with cool people. ‚Ä¶"

37,Susie's Saloon, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I think this place has the potential to be a great sports bar/pub (lots of TVs, western decor, sports memorabilia, cozy atmosphere with ample seating), but 7 or 8 20 somethings sitting at the back of the bar kept subjecting us to the WORST ‚Ä¶"

43,Susie's Saloon, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Very unorganised and the waiter keeps forgetting to bring what we ordered, even though we already paid.

44,Susie's Saloon, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Staff was uneducated and slow moving.  No one could pay any attention to us.  Other guests were upset about bad service.  A group of 15 walked in and one bartender decided to go to lunch because of it.  So he made food and took a break in ‚Ä¶
