3,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Actually no star at all. Waited nearly 45 min for the ‚Äòfood‚Äô.  They forgotten about the starter, thank God. Two of three dishes were simply not eatable. Never ever had such a bad Restaurant experience before. Wasted time and money!!!"
4,Pasta Pasta, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Pasta Pasta is between three and four stars.
The food itself (we had Pasta, Gnocchi and Ravioli) was indeed good and tasty even if it were really small portions. ‚Ä¶"

7,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Poor food, good service. I would never go back due the tasteless food. The sad thing is that the food looked really nice  but food taste wise ot was one of the worst experiences for me. Also the price of 37.50 for 2 people a bit much for ‚Ä¶"
8,Pasta Pasta, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Well, that was not that good, and particularly for the price! They serve you in a huge dish but a very small quantity. The pasta was like a soup with a few pieces inside. And this for 12euros or more, I don't remember exactly."
9,Pasta Pasta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food and nice service! They didn‚Äôt have Spaghetti Bolognese on the menu but had no issue making it anyway when I asked if they had it! Cool atmosphere
10,Pasta Pasta, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good Pasta and Bruscetta. Friendly Staff. Portions have the right size. Service is also very quick. The pasta is home made and you can taste that. Prices are very good for what you get.
11,Pasta Pasta, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Came here after searching for vegan pasta. Their online menu is great, it shows all the ingredients for the different types of pasta and sauces, so it's perfect for vegans. You can choose your type of pasta, combine with a sauce and add ‚Ä¶"
12,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,a month ago,"We waited 40 minuten for pasta and a steak
And The steak was cold before the fries arived
Way to expensive for how good it was"
13,Pasta Pasta, 4 stars ,4 years ago,A pretty cosy place to have homemade pasta. The olive platter is a must try. Ravioli is the second. The staff is friendly and it's worth the wait. In terms of pricing it does hurt a bit.
14,Pasta Pasta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great pizza's for a reasonable price. Fast and friendly service in both Dutch and English. has the option to bring your food home in a box which is rare in Europe. Would absolutely recommend!

16,Pasta Pasta, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice and cozy place that gives a rustic feeling. They have several varieties of pizzas, pastas and calzones. We had pastas. The quantity was a lot for one person!! But the taste was very good and so was the service! A definite recommendation!!!"
17,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,2 years ago,One of the worst I've ever been. They just don't care about customers. We ordered save waited awfully long for the food to arrive. When it did arrive my posts with anchovies had just one anchovie. My wife's pasta was swimming in olive oil. When asked they just give a look. A rip off restaurant in the heart of Amsterdam.
18,Pasta Pasta, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The gnocchi is really really good, good prices and nice ambience!"
19,Pasta Pasta, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Incredibly tasty Italian food in the center of Amsterdam. All stuff including cooker are Italians. Open kitchen - so you can see all the process of food preparing. Extremely nice waiters. For sure will come back.

21,Pasta Pasta, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Spare your time and money. The staff is rude, the food truly overpriced, the toilet was broken. Just because you are a tourist you dont deserve that!"
22,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Bad price to quality ratio. Taste was okay, but not worth the price tag. We missed the oregano as finish on the Pizza, that we are used to from other places. Didn't get the order right. Brought the replacement, but instead of artichokes we ‚Ä¶"

24,Pasta Pasta, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"It was nice to hide in this Italian restaurant after a walk in this busy district. The pizza was good, though little overbaked. Staff was helpful and friendly. The only thing we didn't like much was a bit too loud music."
25,Pasta Pasta, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"We passed by this place with expectations of being served indoors with the view of the streets, but we got the boot when we ordered our main course without drinks. ‚Ä¶"
26,Pasta Pasta, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Tried this pasta place in Amsterdam which was quite nice. The pasta is not as ""al-dente"" as it is in Italy but the taste was authentic. You have to order a drink here though if you want to eat here."
27,Pasta Pasta, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is always a must stop for us whenever we are in Amsterdam. Pasta can be so simple but Pasta Pasta is always serving up the best options! It is essentially a make your own pasta place where you start by choosing your type of noodles, ‚Ä¶"

Be careful with the waiter. He'll add things to your order without advicing the extra charge."
31,Pasta Pasta, 2 stars ,3 weeks ago,Bland tasting and under staffed. My experience was not pleasant. Props for the long opening hours!
32,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,7 months ago,"We had to wait 45 minutes for the starters, then another 15 for the main courses. Food was bland and overpriced. The server was impolite and it always took an eternity to even get his atention, whenever we wanted to order or pay.
I would not recommend this place to anyone, I‚Äôd give 0 stars if I could."

36,Pasta Pasta, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place to grab a bite as it was just down the road from our hostel. The prices were really good compared to a lot of Amsterdam! The pizzas were fantastic and our waitress was awesome!
37,Pasta Pasta, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Tried the place right after then could open inside and i can say that this seems like a cosy place. Staff is friendly, food was great...and the beer is always good :) if you get the chance, drop by and support them in these difficult times. Cheers!"
38,Pasta Pasta, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The waitress gives random answers which are wrong. The food that you get is not what's written on the menu. Food is tasteless.

51,Pasta Pasta, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Food was phenomenal! Five stars. I had the lentil soup and my friend had the seafood pasta. However I only gave 3 stars because our waitress disappeared mid meal never to return again and we were then served by a new waitress AND waiter with no explanation! Strange but true!
52,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,2 years ago,"HIGHLY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!! The staff are not professional and most importantly the manager is extremely rude. The manager had a ‚Äòpolicy‚Äô that you are not invited and can not be served food without purchasing a beverage, even tap water is ‚Ä¶"

60,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,2 years ago,We have been assigned to a seat next to thw broken door that I have to shut the door for the restaurant to keep their room warm. We have been asked 3 times to change seat but waitress didn't allow us. Food was very small portion. Slow delivery. There are plenty of choices right next door no need to come back again.
61,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We‚Äôve all had a bad dining experience, but in Pasta Pasta restaurant the staff are experts in ruining your nights. Unfortunately, few days ago we had a terrible dining experience, as the staff working along with the cook had inexcusable behaviors. The waiter was so rude, disrespectful and impolite."
62,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,2 years ago,We entered this restaurant because it is possible to pay with visa electron. Other than this advantage I have nothing else good to say. The food was stale and expensive and the staff told us the only way we can sit down and enjoy our meal ‚Ä¶

67,Pasta Pasta, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was very good, very tasteful, but the gnocchi was a really small portion and The spaghetti carbonara was a ok portion. But the worse part was that we were obligated to order drinks. Despite we didn't want it. They said every costumer should have a drink also ""boss orders"". Price is around ¬£12 and ¬£15"
68,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Absolutely awful. If you want to have a nice time, good food, decent service and overall a pleasant experience, DO NOT go here.

97,Pasta Pasta, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food was good. Table service sadly was not. We waited 25 minutes for a menu and then another 20 minutes to order followed by them missing part of the order. Shame as well because the food was good for the price.
98,Pasta Pasta, 5 stars ,5 years ago,What can I say.. This is a must eat in Amsterdam! If you don't know what it's about your missing out.. You pick your type of pasta.. Then your toppings then you get severed the biggest bowl of the best pasta you have ever had.. The price topped it off for us.

101,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,2 years ago,It was a hell of an experience. The food was not realy nice. The waiter needed more than a hour to bring our food. And not every dish at the same time. Over all. A way overpriced restaurant with bad service and not much better food.
102,Pasta Pasta, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The worst attitude ever faced by the staff and the ""chef"". As soon as we walked out the ""chef"" made a disgraceful gesture with the middle finger up. When we asked for an explanation he started talking in Italian... not visiting ever again and not recommended to anyone. This place should never be opened in this district"

108,Pasta Pasta, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Had a good dinner for a reasonable price. That's not too common in Amsterdam! Service was quick and friendly. The only thing that I found quite odd and also annoying was the loud techno music played in the restaurant.
