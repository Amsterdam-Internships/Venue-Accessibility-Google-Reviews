0,Limon, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Food was very pleasant and it is a good place if you need a fancier kitchen. Generous portions as well 😃 Service could have been a bit faster, but we had a good red merlot to keep us company."
1,Limon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Cozy spot right across Amsterdam-South Station. Perfect for a lunch break. Variety of food and drinks options, all come with lots of garnish.  Staff was also very friendly. Would recommend!"
2,Limon, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Located in a very beutyful contemporary area of Amsterdam near the South Station. This restaurant is good , we had steak with potato muffins... something special. The steak was very good quality. The service kind. It is possible to sit outside in a quite area with view to the nice buildings."
3,Limon, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great atmosphere and honest food
4,Limon, 4 stars ,4 months ago,2nd time visiting. Nice place. Was busy when we visited on a Thursday evening. Hadn't booked but they managed to squeeze us in. Small spots in some areas so be prepared :-) …
5,Limon, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Food was good and service was quick. Downstairs they have a bar with music if you prefer to have a drink and dance ;)
6,Limon, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"They have the best burger and mojito
Very friendly and welcoming.. Highly recommended"
7,Limon, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Excellent food, fast and friendly service, nicely varied menu. Ideal because of Q park just across the street, so no losing time on finding a parking spot."
8,Limon, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Awful experience. The kitchen close at 21h, so no proper food after that. The waiters are so impatient to get home that they take half of your order. We came with a dog and he had a bowl of water (that’s why I put 2 stars).  We had super pricy random finger food at the end. Nice design (Amsterdam south), but terrible service."
9,Limon, 5 stars ,4 months ago,We had a very pleasent friday date/dinner at Limon. We have started with delicious oesters and sashimi paired with spanish verdejo wine suggested and main dish (deer steak and rib-eye) to go with italian nero d'avola red wine was truly …
10,Limon, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"They have the best burger and mojito
Very friendly and welcoming.. Highly recommended"
11,Limon, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Nice bar at the Zuidas. Prices are nothing special but interior is quite adventurous and interesting. They don't have ijwit, which is an absolute shame. The cava is nice though."
12,Limon, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"We had an amazing dinner.
Great presentation, high quality and also amazing red wines!"
13,Limon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good offering, pleasant staff. Weird to see the cooks and other staff in the chicken eat while preparing the orders. I swear one of them tasted something from everything he prepared 🤣 …"
14,Limon, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very good place to have a drink with snack
15,Limon, 5 stars ,a year ago,We had a great time here. It's normally more busy during the week days because it is located near the Amsterdam Zuid station. It has a busy business crowd. We found it open and sat on their terrace and enjoyed a couple of drinks while being …

20,Limon, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Oh Limon, probably the biggest advantage is that this place is open till late at night, compared to some other places on the Zuidas. The food here is decent. But at these prices there are better options in the area. Their service is okay, …"
21,Limon, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Unfortunately I can't rate the food, as the unprofessional 'service' was too disappointing to even give it a try. I've been on touch with Limon about a group lunch (20pax) I wanted to organize and, although I initially received quite …"
22,Limon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicate atmosphere, good selection of music (perfect volume), nice staff and nice people. Definitely recommended for those looking for a few after-work drinks or a nice evening with loved ones."
23,Limon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It has become a favourite place to go while here. Staff are friendly, food and drinks are good. Very relaxed with good music. Open until late. Alone, on a date, with colleagues, or with friends...all OK!"
24,Limon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great, polite stuff. Food was delicious, we had some great wines as well. Slightly overpriced, but that's because of the area I suppose."

28,Limon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cute combination of a hip bar, hangout and restaurant. Good place to retreat to after work or to have diner. Worth visiting!"
29,Limon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Limon is a bar in the midst of Amsterdam Zuid. There are chain of bar and restaurant in this area and each of them are comparable to one another leaving couple of them aside. Limon has a good variety of starters and all varieties of beers, wines and hot drinks. They have limited cocktails though."
30,Limon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great little lunch spot.  Broodjes were tasty.  Took multiple people to figure out how to pay by credit card which was a bit silly but otherwise fun.
31,Limon, 1 star ,4 years ago,"More than 40 minutes waiting for my dish, better not go here if you have less than 2 hours lunch break. Food is good but not worth the waiting time."
32,Limon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice spot for lunch. Loved the chicken avocado sandwich. Chairs not very comfortable though 😖
33,Limon, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Hip - for zuidas, friendly enough service, seemingly less crowded than other zuidas ""hot spots"", OK beer selection, terrible music. I'd give it 3,5 stars if I could."
