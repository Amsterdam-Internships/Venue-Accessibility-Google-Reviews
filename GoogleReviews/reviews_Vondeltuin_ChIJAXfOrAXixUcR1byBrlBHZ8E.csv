1,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Possibly the best outdoor cafe space in Amsterdam. Complete renovation in 2020. Simply delightful on a nice weather day. Self service... which we like, so we don't have to rely on poor dutch table service. Great coffee. Great food."
2,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"This cosy restaurant at the main entrance of the Vondelpark (Amstelveenseweg) in Amsterdam has an accessible toilet, very friendly staff, great food and an awesome terrace. The lights and decorations make you feel as if you are on holiday.

5,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Food is ok (nachos). I like that is self service at the cashier (less waiting time for a waiter). The environment is the dey differentiator here.

Parking outside Vondelpark costs a lot. Better to bike."
10,Vondeltuin, 4 stars ,a year ago,"A very nice choice for those days with nice weather, it provides a vacation/holiday mood. inside one of the most important parks in the city. It counts with a bar and also food if you‚Äôre feeling a bit hungry. For more experiences like this follow @quiquinnv"

14,Vondeltuin, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice food that is healthy and not too complicated or expensive. I like the way it is organized by placing your order at the bar but having your food brought out to you. There are employees walking around continuously keeping the place clean which is also nice.
15,Vondeltuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"With sun in the sky and tropical temperatures this place makes you feel you are on a summer vacation! Plenty of alcoholic summer style drinks, and great snacks and food varieties. Try the nacho plate here, it's a fusion and an experience by it's own üåûüåû"

17,Vondeltuin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Nice place. Lovely surroundings but extremely overpriced and poor quality food. I ordered a beetroot salad which cost me 13,50‚Ç¨ and basically it was a bag of greens and a few cubes of beetroot. Definitely not worth the money. My boyfriend ‚Ä¶"

29,Vondeltuin, 4 stars ,7 months ago,The food and ambiance were lovely. It really kinda ruins the experience when there is so much cigarette smoke all around you. Maybe they could have a non-smoking area.

47,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic place to hang when the weather is good. It is a laid back place, you will have to get drinks yourself (which is absolutely fine by me). Don't expect the best food in the world, but joined by a couple of drinks in the sun it is more than fine!"
48,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very good vibe. We had nachos and they were delicious and the staff is friendly and fast. The cocktails bar is a very appreciated addition.
49,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"As a father of a 4 year old, having a sand pit and playground right next to a place where you can eat and drink during both day and evening, is a real bonus. They'll allow you to bring your order to the playground. There's a trolley where ‚Ä¶"

59,Vondeltuin, 1 star ,10 months ago,This used to be a cosy place (always pricy but cosy) but since the remodelling it‚Äòs just a posh spot. Increadibly slow and disorganized service.

61,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Nice spot in the great Vondel Park.
62,Vondeltuin, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The key reason why this place is very appealing is its location. Green and jungly in the middle of Amsterdam at the end of the Vondelpark. The wine was good, but that's about it, and that adds up to two stars. We arrived at a self service ‚Ä¶"

65,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"In my opinion, no questions, best cafe in Vondelpark. Lots of drinks and on sunny day there was extra drinks point where tenders fixed fresh drinks. They have brrakfast, afternoon and evening menu separately and  between 4pm and 6pm menu ‚Ä¶"

70,Vondeltuin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Went there several times and was happy with the food and service - however today we had to deal with a very arrogant and unfriendly waiter.

71,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice restaurant In the middle of the park really nice atmosphere with full tables around the bar. Really good burger much more premium than I was expecting would recommend for anyone wanting a cheap but tasteful meal
72,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We happened upon this place while cycling through the Vondelpark (as do most people, I would assume). I guess I had never noticed it the first year we lived in Amsterdam, but now it's synonymous with beautiful sunny days in spring/summer. ‚Ä¶"

88,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Self service garden bar in Vondelpark. Nice atmosphere and good food. Service is a bit slow but suits the tranquil location and vibes
89,Vondeltuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Parkside al fresco eatery serving well prepared food with toddler play area adjacent. Inside ordering with food delivered to table simplifies service appropriately for the atmosphere.
90,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Small and nice place in the Vondelpark. Better to book in advance. If the day is sunny, chance to find a table very difficult. Food is ok."

100,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great big park in center of Amsterdam. Almost easy to miss. On a beautiful sunny day, easy to lost track of time"
101,Vondeltuin, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Fantastic little getaway in the overcrowded Vondelpark. Interior is cozy, but not for anyone sensitive to drafts. ""Tosti"" means eating with your hands so prepare to get dirty!"

106,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It is an inviting place, the food is good. Watch out for the brunch-dinner time switch around 4 pm this is common in The Netherlands."
107,Vondeltuin, 3 stars ,a year ago,Food was not bad. Service was average. Its a nice venue though.
108,Vondeltuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great burger. Drinks prices ok. Lots of seating but could do with more shade when really hot
109,Vondeltuin, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Great place to hangout. The garden is perfect. However the food is quite bad - very greasy and unhealthy. The inside space is also not the best.
110,Vondeltuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Ideal for a summer evening gathering with friends. Bar food and drinks at fare prices. Location is great if weather is nice.
111,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,COVID complaint seating arrangement. Lots of space. Really good ambience and friendly service.
112,Vondeltuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"All day every day, when the sun shines. Our favourite hangout on sunny days to drink Aperol Spritz, paired with deliciously sinful bitterballen."
