5,Ponte Arcari, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very good italian pasta, friendly staff."
6,Ponte Arcari, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Wasn't impressed, it seemed that it was more about the show than the food. Very busy, that's true, we waited over an hour for the food and they still didn't manage to bring the order all right, so we waited more. The food was okay but the service was more chatty than precise. Tiny place so be prepared to wait."
7,Ponte Arcari, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Small and hectic place. Fast service. A combination of many tourists and some locals. Authentic and original Italian chef. Refurbished in 2018. You can choose from the menu, but my advice is to ask the owner for the daily specials. Always ‚Ä¶"

11,Ponte Arcari, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a find! Authentic Italian food in a small cozy neighborhood restaurant. The staff is attentive and friendly. The food is delicious - fresh made when you order. There are only 8 tables. So arrive early.
12,Ponte Arcari, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My wife and I ate there in 2016 and found it a wonderful experience.  The food was very authentic (I'm Italian/Canadian and have travelled to Italy on numerous occasions) and the service was excellent (attentive, perceptive, friendly).  We ‚Ä¶"

14,Ponte Arcari, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Visited this restaurant on the recommendation of our son. Booked ahead to avoid disappointment. Very friendly staff (the owner and one other). Couldn't believe the excellent food that came out of a very small kitchen. Took around 2.5 hours ‚Ä¶
15,Ponte Arcari, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent, a MUST go to restaurant!!  Been to Amsterdam three times, been to Ponte arcari 6 times.

18,Ponte Arcari, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Step back in time to this little gem ! Excellent food served with passion humour and in such ambient surroundings.

20,Ponte Arcari, 1 star ,3 years ago,NOT a Italian restaurant! They did over book and we never got to the main course! If you want a real Italian restaurant we strongly recommend to find another one! It seems like they are into this business for the money only. We experienced people get asked to leave the place as they had new customers to get their seat. Bad service!!!!
21,Ponte Arcari, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food (ravioli) was expensive and almost cold inside. Service was disastrous and waiter became vulgar when I raised concerned about the bill (which had to be corrected 3 times while there was only 2 main dish and a bottle of water). Overall, ‚Ä¶"
