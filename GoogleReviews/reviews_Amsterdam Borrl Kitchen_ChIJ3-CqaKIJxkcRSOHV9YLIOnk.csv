1,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I came here with one friend and two infants. The staff was really welcoming. They set up a swing for my baby so that she would not get bored, and they gave us some bread for the babies to chew on. The red wine was also tasty."

18,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The very first I've visited during my stay in Amsterdam. A great and unique place when comparing with all the rest I've paid a visit. Top quality service that keeps an eye on every visitor. The plate with plethora of different dishes is what I've enjoyed the most.
19,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great place for a borrel. The only dissapointment was that the veggies for the cheese fondue were cold and that kind of spoiled the whole thing. Otherwise very tasty and good atmosphere! Pictures by Manon ;-)
20,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super chilled and cozy. My friend and I shared a fish platter and sweet potato fries. If you come for dinner like us, at first glance, they may not seem to offer so many options, but no! Do order a plate because it's really diverse and from …"

40,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Used to like coming here, everyone was attentive and giving tips and ideas of what to try out etc... but the last few times the staff has been rude. Guess they are doing pretty good in the pandemic that they feel they don't need regulars to keep coming... a shame."

46,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"After an afternoon at the Artis zoo, it was a good spot to rest our legs. However, maybe not the best option with a kid. Among friends it would be a good spot to chill out. Service wise, have to be patient. But I don't blame on the team, …"

55,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Burger was well made, but very strange taste, almost like a cheap BBQ sauce, ruined the taste. Water carafe had visible mold growing inside (very small amount but still). French fish was good as were the fries, and excellent service."
56,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy and relaxing. Food took a bit to deliver, not excessive but a little slow. Service was quite nice, friendly and available. Special requests were fine, in this case scrambled eggs instead of over easy. My flat white coffee was perfectly …"
57,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Converted into a local deli store with a constant new assortment. Definitely worth a visit. Try the Glühgin, which is like warm liquid apple pie with gin :)"
58,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I ordered savoury pancakes there... They came literally runny in the middle and when I asked to get them done again, they just heated them up making them very stodgy and not really nice. Bacon by that time got cold. On the plus side, nice tea and my partner had a lovely English breakfast. Nice atmosphere, not a great service."
59,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Be warry of the prices here, I'm not sure if it's because I'm a tourist they bumped the prices up, or if they genuinely are that expensive. We stopped off just to have a quick drink on our way home from the zoo. 4 500ml glasses of Leffe …"
60,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great for lunch or dinner when visiting Artis Zoo but definitely also worth a detour. This is fresh, honest food. I had the chef's burger twice now and had two different but positive experiences because different ingredients were used. My …"
61,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 5 stars ,a month ago,Very nice place with delicious food.
62,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Just ok. The burger meat was only a bought one. Not really good. The fries were ok but not special. And the waiters forgot each time one of the ordered things... dinner should have startet at 17:00 but we could order at 17:40 and were …

65,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Order a drink and watch the rest of the world pass by while you enjoy a delicious sharing platter (or two!) in relaxed style. A good variety of tasty food and engaging staff, set in an enchanting part of the city. Borrl Kitchen is ideally located opposite Artis Zoo and Micropia and nearby the Botanical Gardens. Highly recommended."
66,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Casual place with good food options to share, like the Flammkuchen and the fries. A few non trivial beer on tap options too, like La Trappe and Punk IPA. Good cost benefit."

75,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 1 star ,3 years ago,Reserved a table and turned up to be told that we had to sit at a bar. Not a problem but the bar was surrounded by upturned chairs. Asked the waiter to move the chairs so we could sit. The waiter proceeded to clutch his own head and then …

78,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Reminded me of the lounge bars in the UK. I feel their timing for the menu is needlessly complex. We arrived at 3ish and found we couldn't order half the stuff on the menu because of their timings. Happily go back again at the right time to try the other bits though.

95,Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen, 1 star ,4 years ago,Couldn't say anything on taste never achieved to even order... When we repeatedly tried we were rudely told they were too busy preparing drinks to take orders. Apparently staff too incompetent to handle 8 tables in the small shop.
