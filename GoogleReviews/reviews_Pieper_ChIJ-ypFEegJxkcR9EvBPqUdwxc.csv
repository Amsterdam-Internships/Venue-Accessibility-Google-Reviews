0,Pieper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I arrived and requested a Cafe Americano and it was like being home in the Southern States of the USA. Carolus was cheerful, outgoing and extremely friendly to the customers that were present. The coffee was very good. Enjoyed a couple of …"
1,Pieper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely fantastic must-go Amsterdam experience. One of the very classic bruin-cafes (brown cafes, don't mix with coffee shops). The place was perfectly stale and had a fabulous atmosphere of the A'dam spirit. What more, it is not the …"
2,Pieper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"After walking for hours this was a great place to stop. The host gave us great recommendations of local beers to drink, he was spot on! We sat right by the canal & soaked in the atmosphere of cyclists, holiday makers, sailers and life! Highly recommended"
3,Pieper, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"So, if you are looking for a genuine Dutch bar experience that is somewhat tourist friendly definitely visit. However, do not complain that you cannot pay with your credit card, that they don't have a soy latte, you had to wait a bit longer …"
4,Pieper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Charming place with the bartender who served us, made an effort in speaking any language, nice lighting, pub style with an underground bathroom. A cute little bar if you looking for some drinks. At this bar I had the first Heineken Ive liked."
5,Pieper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favorite spots in Amsterdam. Fantastic location at the corner of Prinzengracht and Leidsegracht, just down from Leidseplein. The staff is friendly, the beers are tasty, and whether you sit inside or outside it's a cozy place to relax."
6,Pieper, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"very good place, excellent attention and they welcomed us and my two little dogs"
7,Pieper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great little brown bar in the centre of town. Very cozy and the beer prices are very good.
Definitely come here for a beer and view of the canal.
7/7 would Pieper here again"
8,Pieper, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Perfect place for a beer on the channels. The interior is typical Amsterdam (dark) and the 'menu' as well, including the traditional leverworst, zuur and osseworst"
9,Pieper, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Adorable little bar on the canal. Quick service and decent prices for beer.
10,Pieper, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Some decent beers, but a place in the middle of town that doesn't accept anything but Dutch credit card or cash makes it somewhat less inviting for foreigners. And becoming agitated because you only have visa and Master card is the reason for the two stars. Plenty of better, more inviting places in close proximity."
11,Pieper, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice vibe and good location. Had a decent selection of single malts, which was refreshing to see. Ran out of the good beer quite early into the night, so that was a bit disappointing. Still, we'd come back anytime"
12,Pieper, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Quirky old small bar with charm, seating inside and out and a good selection of beer's available. I would give a higher rating however even with 2 members of staff working it took over 40 minutes to be served, even with having to go back up …"
13,Pieper, 2 stars ,2 years ago,We were waiting on the terrace for 10 minutes and no one came to take the order. I got in the bar and took two beers outside myself. No prices on the menu for beers. We paid for a small and big glass of Heineken 9 euros. We didn't get a receipt.
14,Pieper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"These bruin bars are disappearing which is a shame.  It was the first place in 3 days that i used cash,  brilliant!  They don't even take credit cards.  Beer was fantastic and snacks smelt delicious.  There were 5 old Dutch locals at a …"
15,Pieper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely man serving who was very accommodating. Spoke brilliant English, brought our drinks over to our table for us. Made us feel very included and right at home."
16,Pieper, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Friendly staff serving good beers and platters. The  small wooden building dates from 1666. Fun steep steps down to the loos. The barman provided playing cards on request so like people on other tables we played a few hands of Queimes.
17,Pieper, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Café Pieper has a pub feel with very friendly staff. I wandered in looking for a pint and information regarding the local music scene. The two barkeeps made a concerted effort to find recommendations online. Café Pieper is on one corner …
18,Pieper, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This is one of my favourite bars in Amsterdam.
Its twisted leaning structure adds to its caracter. Sitting on the terrace watching the world go by is in my opinion a great way to spend a few hours. …"
19,Pieper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool local bruin bar. Limited selection of beer, does not take credit cards. All in all, exactly what you want (and should expect) out of a true Amsterdam bruin bar."
20,Pieper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Have been twice, staff were great and can offer advice on local beers to try. Great atmosphere, chilled out with friendly people around if you're looking to start up a conversation with some Amsterdam locals"

24,Pieper, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A small and authentic little cafe with a nice beer selection.  The interior reminded me of a captain's cabin in an old man o' war.
25,Pieper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely vibe. If you visit Amsterdam this one is great to just have a few “Fluitjes”
