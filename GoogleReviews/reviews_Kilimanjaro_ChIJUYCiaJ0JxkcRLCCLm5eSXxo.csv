1,Kilimanjaro, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Fantastic food ! Also great vegetarian and vegan options. also loved the home made gingerbeer. And friendly staff.
2,Kilimanjaro, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"An Ethiopian gem of Amsterdam! The owner is the cook, and he is just as friendly as his food is delicious (and it is DELICIOUS). He makes everything himself: the vegan food on the menu, the vegan sugarless desserts (ever heard of an avocado pie?!?) and the drinks. It's a cute place, would definitely recommend it. I'm coming back asap xD"

You won't regret coming here, if anything you will leave the place already making a reservation for a next time..."
