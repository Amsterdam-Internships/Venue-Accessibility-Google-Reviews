0,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Quick service, affordable and great food. Authentic Asian food and really felt like a taste of home. The portions are generous and my partner and I were satisfied with one Peking Duck and one portion of rice. We were genuinely so happy to have found this place."
1,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great carry out through Uber Eats! So fast and delicious. Amazing I didn‚Äôt try it before. Great price and huge portions.
2,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Initial service by the elderly lady was a little bit clipped until we were leaving at which point she seemed to improve. But the elderly man who served us later was lovely and the food was pretty authentic. Nice big servings too. Wouldn't hesitate to come again despite the slightly cold welcome.
3,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The staff are really helpful especially the manager.
However, it's not a patch on the original!
It's objective is to make money on the name by providing a space for big groups. ‚Ä¶"

24,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Finally some proper, authentic Hor Fun in Amsterdam! Amazing food and friendly, fast service!"
25,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A beautifully decorated restaurant inside, with friendly staff. We've eaten here a few times this holiday and the food has always been tasty and healthy. On one occasion they got the order wrong, beware the lady who uses her memory to take down the order rather than a notepad. We'll still go back."
26,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was just ok, it would be 3 stars overall, but the staff was mean when I asked for a glass to place my daughter ice cream, they first bring a dish, then a cup, and finally talked down in Chinese what I don't understand. The owner needed to do something about it."
27,Nam Kee, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Very bad quality. Chicken and pork meat tasted awfully, we could only eat the rice. The food came about 3-4 minutes after we ordered it and was pretty cold. The service is not friendly. We only ate 1/4 of the food and were not even asked ‚Ä¶"
28,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Probably one of the best Chinese restaurants in the area. Do not expect a smiling waiter unless the owner walks around. It is always crowded with Chinese people which is a great indication of the quality of the food. Portions are big. So if you are very hungry you know now where to go.
29,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nam Kee is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Amsterdam. They are present at 3 locations. This one, at the Heineken Square, has the nicest interior, but the quality of the food is a tad below the two other locations. Good choice of ‚Ä¶"

But one of the staff members especially came and apologised for the inconvenience. He suggested another duck preparation which turned out to be excellent. I was very impressed by their gesture."
31,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Best oysters ever eaten also had some unbelievable shrimp and Peking duck. I go to Mainland China and Hong Kong every 2 months but this food was really went with 6 people and service was awesome but the food is what I would come back again ‚Ä¶

33,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,9 years ago,After a late dinner experience my wife and I returned to this little gem of a Chinese restaurant In Amsterdam.  The Dim Sum  menu is larger and more varied than found in Most Dutch establishments.  The Oysters both fried and in black bean ‚Ä¶
34,Nam Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,Rudest staff I have ever come across. Food was also nearly as vile as the people who served us it. Greasy tasteless food. The lady who served us refused to let us pay seperatly as she was attempting to over charge us then refused to give us change when we paid seperatly. Cannot recommend more not going to this awful restaurant.
35,Nam Kee, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Worst restaurant experience. We had a lunch menu for 10 euro. The soup was like water, chicken and a kind of vegetable. It doesnt have any taste. The main was rice with chicken and the same veg as the soup had. They chopped the chicken with all the bones in it, it looked disgusting. Check the pictures before you sit in."
36,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favorite places in Amsterdam. Food is good and way above Dutch standards. Service is great, even if you came right after a group of Chinese tourists you won't wait long. Starters (dim sum, ousters, etc) and meat are great. If you ‚Ä¶"
37,Nam Kee, 1 star ,10 months ago,"Really disgusting, old produce, even older oil. Avoid at all costs unless you want food poisoning."
38,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Tried the salt and pepper chicken and it was delicious! Good size portion too. Also had some shrimp shumai, always a win."
39,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Loved it. Big portions and tasty dishes. The Pecking duck is recommended, as the beef with honey and pepper, and the sweet and sour pork and chicken. And the pancakes with duck are a nice starter!"
40,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,6 years ago,Overpriced and really bland. Including a pot of chili sauce does not equate to making decent Chinese food with flavour. ‚Ä¶
41,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,6 years ago,There are a couple of Chinese restaurants in Amsterdam wit this same name. Go to the one at Zeedijk and skip this one. I've been here a couple of times and the food is dull tasting. Most of the people working here are friendly but others are really grumpy. As if they really hate their work... Such a shame.
42,Nam Kee, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Disgusting.
I don't know what's the saddest between the fact that this restaurant made one of the worst rice I have ever taste despite it's an Asian restaurant or that the ‚Ä¶"
43,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Really nice food. Really no need to spend more than 25e to have nice dishes. One of the best Chinese restaurants in Amsterdam. Also the waiters are here more nice if you compare it to other nam kee restaurants.
44,Nam Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,"My friend‚Äôs bag got snatched while we were busy eating. The pickpocket appeared like an ordinary customer too. We had to go to the local embassy to report his stolen passport. Please be very, very vigilant with your belongings when you visit this restaurant."
45,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good Chinese food
46,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"We were long to be served, they didn't bring the prawn crackers that I ordered. They took long to bring the food. The mixed meat soup tasted horrible. Don't waste your time in this place."
47,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great real authentic Chinese food...must go for the triple meat platter with rice...the Roasted duck is devine...the lemon chicken is awesome...wonton minced beef is a must....I had a whole duck so you can imagine how good it is...
48,Nam Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,So Nam Kee at Nieuwmarkt is quite a famous name in Amsterdam its famous for its oysters mainly because it was in some dutch movie a while ago. So i thought this place at Heinekenplein should be the same its not. Its a TOURIST TRAP whe had ‚Ä¶
49,Nam Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I booked a table in the venue 2 days ahead, called the same day to confirm - no reservation. Rebooked again - and upon arrival there were no tables available.

51,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Always visit Nam Kee every year, This year 3 days in row."

57,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Service was soooo good, way better than other Chinese restaurants in London. The food was great, and worth trying."
58,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best chineese on the Zeedijk. Isn't cosy and you might be sitting with strangers on 1 table. But the food is worth it.

61,Nam Kee, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Outrageous. I understand not speaking English, but disconnecting the call while I attempt to speak Dutch to explain something? I am shocked and disgusted. Do not go there. I'll add, 2 of the employees did that. Not just one."
